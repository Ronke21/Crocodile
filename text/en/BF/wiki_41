<text>The South African rand, or simply the rand, (sign: R; code: ZAR) is the official currency of South Africa. It is subdivided into 100 cents (sign: &quot;c&quot;), and a comma separates the rand and cents.

The South African rand is legal tender in the Common Monetary Area member states of Namibia, Lesotho, and Eswatini, with these three countries also having national currencies: (the dollar, the loti and the lilangeni respectively) pegged with the rand at parity and still widely accepted as substitutes. The rand was also legal tender in Botswana until 1976 when the pula replaced the rand at par.

The rand is legal tender in Zimbabwe as part of its multiple currency system, which also includes other currencies such as the Euro, the Pound Sterling, the US dollar, and the Zimbabwean ZiG.

== Etymology ==

The rand takes its name from the Witwatersrand (&quot;white waters&#x27; ridge&quot; in English, being the Afrikaans and Dutch word for &#x27;ridge&#x27;), the ridge upon which Johannesburg is built and where most of South Africa&#x27;s gold deposits were found. In English, Afrikaans and Dutch, the singular and plural forms of the unit (&quot;rand&quot;) are the same: one rand, ten rand, and two million rand.

==History==

The rand was introduced in the Union of South Africa in 1961, three months before the country declared itself a republic. A Decimal Coinage Commission had been set up in 1956 to consider a move away from the denominations of pounds, shillings, and pence; it submitted its recommendations on 8 August 1958. It replaced the South African pound as legal tender, at the rate of 2 rand to 1 pound, or 10 shillings to the rand. The government introduced a mascot, Decimal Dan, &quot;the rand-cent man&quot; (known in Afrikaans as Daan Desimaal). This was accompanied by a radio jingle to inform the public about the new currency. Although pronounced in the Afrikaans style as in the jingles when introduced, the contemporary pronunciation in South African English is .

===Brief exchange rate history===

====1961–2000====

One rand was worth US$1.40 (R0.72 per dollar) from the time of its inception in 1961 until late 1971, and the U.S. dollar became stronger than the South African currency for the first time on 15 March 1982. Its value thereafter fluctuated as various exchange rate dispensations were implemented by the South African authorities. By the early 1980s, high inflation and mounting political pressure combined with sanctions placed against the country due to international opposition to the apartheid system had started to erode its value. The currency broke above parity with the dollar for the first time in March 1982. It continued to trade between R1 and R1.30 to the dollar until June 1984, when the currency&#x27;s depreciation gained momentum. By February 1985, it was trading at over R2 per dollar, and in July of that year, all foreign exchange trading was suspended for three days to try to stop the depreciation.

By the time that State President P. W. Botha made his Rubicon speech on 15 August 1985, it had weakened to R2.40 per dollar. The currency recovered somewhat between 1986 and 1988, trading near the R2 level most of the time and breaking beneath it sporadically. The recovery was short-lived; by the end of 1989, the rand was trading at more than R2.50 per dollar.

As it became clear in the early 1990s that the country was destined for Black majority rule and one reform after the other was announced, uncertainty about the country&#x27;s future hastened the depreciation until the level of R3 to the dollar was breached in November 1992. A host of local and international events influenced the currency after that, most notably the 1994 general election, which had it weaken to over R3.60 to the dollar, the election of Tito Mboweni as the governor of the South African Reserve Bank, and the inauguration of President Thabo Mbeki in 1999, which had it quickly slide to over R6 to the dollar. The controversial land reform programme that was initiated in Zimbabwe, followed by the September 11, 2001 attacks, propelled it to its weakest historical level of R13.84 to the dollar in December 2001.

====2001–2011====
 
This sudden depreciation in 2001 led to a formal investigation and a dramatic recovery. By the end of 2002, the currency was trading under R9 to the dollar again, and by the end of 2004, it was trading under R5.70. The currency softened somewhat in 2005, trading around R6.35 to the dollar at the end of the year. At the start of 2006, however, the currency resumed its rally and, as of 19 January 2006, was trading under R6 to the dollar again. However, the rand weakened significantly during the second and third quarters of 2006 (i.e., April through September).

In sterling terms, it fell from around 9.5% to just over 7%, losing some 25% of its international trade-weighted value in six months. In late 2007, the rand rallied modestly to just over 8%, only to experience a precipitous slide during the first quarter of 2008.

This downward slide could be attributed to a range of factors: South Africa&#x27;s worsening current account deficit, which widened to a 36‑year high of 7.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007; inflation at a five-year high of just under 9%; escalating global risk aversion as investors&#x27; concerns over the spreading impact of the sub-prime crisis grew; and a general flight to &quot;safe havens&quot;, away from the perceived risks of emerging markets. The rand depreciation was exacerbated by the Eskom electricity crisis, which arose from the utility&#x27;s inability to meet the country&#x27;s rapidly growing energy demands.

====2012–present====

A stalled mining industry in late 2012 led to new lows in early 2013. In late January 2014, the rand slid to R11.25 to the dollar, with analysts attributing the shift to &quot;word from the US Federal Reserve that it would trim back stimulus spending, which led to a massive sell-off in emerging economies.&quot; In 2014, South Africa experienced its worst year against the US dollar since 2009, and in March 2015, the rand traded at its worst since 2002. At the time, Trading Economics released data that the rand &quot;averaged R4.97 to the dollar between 1972–2015, reaching an all time high of R12.45 in December 2001 and a record low of R0.67 in June of 1973.&quot; By the end of 2014, the rand had weakened to R15.05 per dollar, partly due to South Africa&#x27;s consistent trade account deficit with the rest of the world.
From 9–13 December 2015, over four days, the rand dropped over 10% due to what some suspected was President Jacob Zuma&#x27;s surprise announcement that he would be replacing the Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene with the little-known David van Rooyen. The rapid drop in value stemmed when Zuma backtracked and announced that the better-known previous Minister of Finance, Pravin Gordhan, would instead be appointed to the post. Zuma&#x27;s surprise sacking of Nene damaged international confidence in the rand, and the exchange rate was volatile throughout much of January 2016 and reached an all-time low of R17.9169 to the US dollar on 9 January 2016 before rebounding to R16.57 later the same day.

The January drop in value was also partly caused by Japanese retail investors cutting their losses in the currency to look for higher-yield investments elsewhere and due to concerns over the impact of the economic slowdown in China, South Africa&#x27;s largest export market. By mid-January, economists were speculating that the rand could expect to see further volatility for the rest of 2016. By 29 April, it reached its highest performance over the previous five months, exchanging at a rate of R14.16 to the United States dollar.

Following the United Kingdom voting to leave the European Union, the rand dropped in value over 8% against the US$ on 24 June 2016, the currency&#x27;s largest single-day decline since the 2008 economic crash. This was partly due to a general global financial retreat from currencies seen as risky to the US dollar and partly due to concerns over how British withdrawal from the EU would impact the South African economy and trade relations.

In April 2017, a Reuters poll estimated that the rand would remain relatively stable for the rest of the year, as two polls found that analysts had already factored in a possible downgrade to &quot;junk&quot; status. At the time, Moody&#x27;s rated South Africa two notches above junk status. When President Jacob Zuma narrowly won a motion of no confidence in South Africa in August 2017, the rand continued to slide, dropping 1.7% that day. In September 2017, Goldman Sachs said that the debt and corruption of Eskom Holdings was the biggest risk to South Africa&#x27;s economy and the exchange rate of the rand. At the time, it had no permanent CEO, and Colin Coleman of Goldman Sachs in Africa said the company was &quot;having discussions on solutions&quot; on finding credible management. In October 2017, the rand firmed against the US dollar as it recovered from a six-month low. Reuters noted, &quot;South Africa is highly susceptible to global investor sentiment as the country relies on foreign money to cover its large budget and current account deficits.&quot; On 13 November 2017, the rand fell by over 1% when the budget chief, Michael Sachs, stood down from his position in Zuma&#x27;s administration.

In October 2022, the rand sank to its lowest point in two years, reaching R18.46 to the US dollar on 25 October 2022.

==Coins==

Coins were introduced in 1961 in denominations of , 1, , 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents. In 1965, 2-cent coins replaced the cent coins. The cent coin was last struck for circulation in 1973. The 1 rand coin for circulation was introduced in 1967, followed by 2 rand coins in 1989 and 5 rand coins in 1994. Production of the 1 and 2-cent coins was discontinued in 2002, followed by 5-cent coins in 2012, primarily due to inflation having devalued them, but they remain legal tender. Shops normally round the total purchase price of goods to the nearest 10 cents.

To curb counterfeiting, a new 5-rand coin was released in August 2004. Security features introduced on the coin include a bimetal design (similar to the €1 and €2 coins, the Thai ฿10 coin, the pre-2018 Philippine ₱10 coin, the British £2 coin, and the Canadian $2 coin), a specially serrated security groove along the rim and microlettering.

On 3 May 2023, the South African Reserve Bank announced that a new series of coins would be released. These will have the same denominations as the previous series. The 10c will feature an image of the Cape Honey Bee, the 20c the Bitter Aloe, the 50c the Knysna Turaco, the R1 the Springbok, the R2 the King Protea, and the R5 the Southern Right Whale.

==Banknotes==

The first series of rand banknotes was introduced in 1961 in denominations of 1, 2, 10, and 20 rand, with similar designs and colours to the preceding pound notes to ease the transition. They bore the image of what was believed at the time to be Jan van Riebeeck, the first VOC administrator of Cape Town. It was later discovered that the original portrait was not, in fact, Van Riebeeck at all, but a portrait of Bartholomew Vermuyden had been mistaken for Van Riebeeck.

In 1966, a second series with designs that moved away from the previous pound notes was released. Notes with 1, 5, and 10 rand denominations were produced with predominantly one colour per note. A smaller 1 rand note with the same design was introduced in 1973, and a 2 rand note was introduced in 1974. The 20 rand denomination from the first series was dropped. The practice of having an English and an Afrikaans version of each note was continued in this series.

The 1978 series began with denominations of 2, 5, 10, and 20 rand, with a 50 rand introduced in 1984. This series had only one language variant for each denomination of note. Afrikaans was the first language on the 2, 10, and 50 rand, while English was the first on the 5 and 20 rand. A coin replaced the 1 rand note.


In the 1990s, the notes were redesigned with images of the Big Five wildlife species. 10, 20, and 50 rand notes were introduced in 1992 &amp; 1993, retaining the colour scheme of the previous issue. Coins were introduced for the 2 and 5 rand, replacing the notes of the previous series, mainly because of the severe wear and tear experienced with low-denomination notes in circulation. In 1994, 100 and 200 rand notes were introduced.

The 2005 series has the same principal design but with additional security features, such as colour-shifting ink on the 50 rand and higher and the EURion constellation. The obverses of all denominations were printed in English, while two other official languages were printed on the reverse, thus using all 11 official languages of South Africa.

In 2010, the South African Reserve Bank and commercial banks withdrew all 1994 series 200-rand banknotes due to relatively high-quality counterfeit notes in circulation.

In 2011, the South African Reserve Bank issued defective 100 rand banknotes which lacked fluorescent printing visible under UV light. In June, the printing of this denomination was moved from the South African Bank Note Company to Crane Currency&#x27;s Swedish division (Tumba Bruk), which reportedly produced 80 million 100 rand notes. The South African Reserve Bank shredded 3.6 million 100-rand banknotes printed by Crane Currency because they had the same serial numbers as a batch printed by the South African Bank Note Company. In addition, the notes printed in Sweden were not the correct colour and were 1mm short.

On 11 February 2012, President Jacob Zuma announced that the country would be issuing a new set of banknotes bearing Nelson Mandela&#x27;s image. They were entered into circulation on 6 November 2012. These contained the same denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 rand.

In 2013, the 2012 series was updated with the addition of the EURion constellation to all five denominations. They were entered into circulation on 6 November 2013.

On 18 July 2018, a special commemorative series of banknotes was released in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s birth. This series includes notes of all denominations, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 rand. These notes will circulate alongside the existing notes. The notes depict the standard face of Nelson Mandela on the obverse. Still, instead of the Big Five animals on the reverse, they show a younger Mandela with different iconic scenes relating to his legacy. These scenes comprise the rolling hills of the Eastern Cape, featuring Mandela&#x27;s humble birthplace of Mvezo (10 rand); the home of Mandela in Soweto, where he defined his political life alongside other struggle icons (20 rand); the site where Mandela was captured near Howick, following 17 months in hiding, where a monument to him has been erected (50 rand); the place of Mandela&#x27;s 27-year imprisonment at Robben Island, showing a pile of quarried limestone (100 rand); the statue of Mandela at the Union Buildings in remembrance of when he was inaugurated there in 1994 (200 rand).

On 3 May 2023, the South African Reserve Bank announced that a new series of banknotes would retain the image of Nelson Mandela on the obverse while showing the Big 5 in a family depiction on the reverse. This series contains the same denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 rand.

<text>Bharati Mukherjee (July 27, 1940 – January 28, 2017) was an Indian American-Canadian writer and professor emerita in the department of English at the University of California, Berkeley. She was the author of a number of novels and short story collections, as well as works of nonfiction.

==Early life and education==
Of Indian Hindu Bengali Brahmin origin, Mukherjee was born in present-day Kolkata, West Bengal, India during British rule. She later travelled with her parents to Europe after Independence, only returning to Calcutta in the early 1950s. There she attended the Loreto School. She received her B.A. from the University of Calcutta in 1959 as a student of Loreto College, and subsequently earned her M.A. from Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in 1961. She next travelled to the United States to study at the University of Iowa. She received her M.F.A. from the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop in 1963 and her PhD in 1969 from the department of Comparative Literature.

==Career==

After more than a decade living in Montreal and Toronto in Canada, Mukherjee and her husband, Clark Blaise, returned to the United States. She wrote of the decision in &quot;An Invisible Woman,&quot; published in a 1981 issue of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Mukherjee and Blaise co-authored &quot;Days and Nights in Calcutta&quot; (1977). They also wrote the 1987 book, &quot;The Sorrow and the Terror&quot; regarding the Air India Flight 182 tragedy.

In addition to writing many works of fiction and non-fiction, Mukherjee taught at McGill University, Skidmore College, Queens College, and City University of New York before joining the faculty at UC Berkeley.

In 1988 Mukherjee won the National Book Critics Circle Award for her collection &quot;The Middleman and Other Stories&quot;. In a 1989 interview with Ameena Meer, Mukherjee stated that she considered herself an American writer, and not an Indian expatriate writer.

Mukherjee died due to complications of rheumatoid arthritis and takotsubo cardiomyopathy on January 28, 2017, in Manhattan at the age of 76. She was survived by her husband and son. Her other son, Bart, predeceased her in 2015.

<doc id="298695" wikidata="Q208261" url="?curid=298695" title="Ionian Revolt">
<text>The Ionian Revolt, and associated revolts in Aeolis, Doris, Cyprus and Caria, were military rebellions by several Greek regions of Asia Minor against Persian rule, lasting from 499 BC to 493 BC. At the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them, along with the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants, Histiaeus and Aristagoras. The cities of Ionia had been conquered by Persia around 540 BC, and thereafter were ruled by native tyrants, nominated by the Persian satrap in Sardis. In 499 BC, the tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great.

In 498 BC, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, the Ionians marched on, captured, and burnt Sardis. However, on their return journey to Ionia, they were followed by Persian troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus. This campaign was the only offensive action by the Ionians, who subsequently went on the defensive. The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellion, but the spread of the revolt to Caria meant that the largest army, under Daurises, relocated there. While initially campaigning successfully in Caria, this army was annihilated in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus. This battle had started a stalemate for the rest of 496 BC and 495 BC.

By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and they made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea, but was decisively beaten at the Battle of Lade, after the defection of the Samians. Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its population was brought under Persian rule. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result. The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia which was generally considered to be both just and fair.

The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Persian Empire, and as such represents the first phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, according to Herodotus, Darius decided to conquer the whole of Greece. In 492 BC, the first Persian invasion of Greece, the next phase of the Greco-Persian Wars, began as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt.

==Sources==

Practically the only primary source for the Ionian Revolt is the Greek historian Herodotus. Herodotus, who has been called the &#x27;Father of History&#x27;, was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his &#x27;Enquiries&#x27; (Greek—&quot;Historia&quot;; English—&quot;(The) Histories&quot;) around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC). Herodotus&#x27;s approach was entirely novel, and at least from the point of view of Western society, he does seem to have invented &#x27;history&#x27; as we know it. As Holland has it: &quot;For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people&#x27;s claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.&quot;

Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with Thucydides. Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the siege of Sestos), and therefore presumably felt that Herodotus&#x27;s history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting. Plutarch criticised Herodotus in his essay &quot;On The Malignity of Herodotus&quot;, describing Herodotus as &quot;philobarbaros&quot; (φιλοβάρβαρος, &quot;barbarian-lover&quot;) and for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed. A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained widely read. However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by the age of democracy and some archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events. The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his &quot;Historia&quot;, but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism. Nevertheless, there are still many historians who believe Herodotus&#x27; account has an anti-Persian bias and that much of his story was embellished for dramatic effect.

==Background==
In the 12th century BC, the Mycenaean civilization fell as part of the Late Bronze Age collapse. During the subsequent dark age, significant numbers of Greeks emigrated to Asia Minor and settled there. These settlers were from three tribal groups: the Aeolians, Dorians and Ionians. The Ionians had settled along the coasts of Lydia and Caria, founding the twelve cities which made up Ionia. These cities (part of the Ionian League) were Miletus, Myus and Priene in Caria; Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedos, Teos, Clazomenae, Phocaea and Erythrae in Lydia; and the islands of Samos and Chios. Although the Ionian cities were independent from each other, they acknowledged their shared heritage, and had a common temple and meeting place, the Panionion. They thus formed a &#x27;cultural league&#x27;, to which they would admit no other cities, or even other tribal Ionians. The cities of Ionia had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous Lydian king Croesus, in around 560 BC. The Ionian cities then remained under Lydian rule until Lydia was in turn conquered by the nascent Achaemenid Empire of Cyrus the Great.

While fighting the Lydians, Cyrus had sent messages to the Ionians asking them to revolt against Lydian rule, which the Ionians had refused to do. After Cyrus completed the conquest of Lydia, the Ionian cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms as they had been subjects of Croesus. Cyrus refused, citing the Ionians&#x27; unwillingness to help him previously. The Ionians thus prepared to defend themselves, and Cyrus sent the Median general Harpagus to conquer Ionia. He first attacked Phocaea; the Phocaeans decided to entirely abandon their city and sail into exile in Sicily, rather than become Persian subjects (although many subsequently returned). Some Teians also chose to emigrate when Harpagus attacked Teos, but the rest of the Ionians remained, and were in turn conquered.

The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus was able to identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects – such as the priesthood of Judea. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians&#x27; internal conflicts. Furthermore, a tyrant might develop an independent streak, and have to be replaced. The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens&#x27; hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.

About 40 years after the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in the reign of the fourth Persian king, Darius the Great, the stand-in Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this familiar predicament. Aristagoras&#x27;s uncle Histiaeus had accompanied Darius on campaign in 513 BC, and when offered a reward, had asked for part of the conquered Thracian territory. Although this was granted, Histiaeus&#x27;s ambition alarmed Darius&#x27;s advisors, and Histiaeus was thus further &#x27;rewarded&#x27; by being compelled to remain in Susa as Darius&#x27;s &quot;Royal Table-Companion&quot;. Taking over from Histiaeus, Aristagoras was faced with bubbling discontent in Miletus. In 500 BC, Aristagoras was approached by some exiles from Naxos, who asked him to take control of the island. Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras approached the satrap of Lydia, Artaphernes, with a proposal. If Artaphernes provided an army, Aristagoras would conquer the island, thus extending the boundaries of the empire for Darius, and he would then give Artaphernes a share of the spoils to cover the cost of raising the army. Artaphernes agreed in principle, and asked Darius for permission to launch the expedition. Darius assented to this, and a force of 200 triremes was assembled in order to attack Naxos the following year.

==Naxos campaign (499 BC)==
In the spring of 499 BC, Artaphernes readied the Persian force, and placed his cousin Megabates in command. He then sent ships on to Miletus, where the Ionian troops levied by Aristagoras embarked, and the force then set sail for Naxos.

The expedition quickly descended into a debacle. Aristagoras fell out with Megabates on the journey towards Naxos, and Herodotus says that Megabates then sent messengers to Naxos, warning the Naxians of the force&#x27;s intention. It is also possible, however, that this story was spread by Aristagoras after the event, by way of a justification for the subsequent failure of the campaign. At any rate, the Naxians were able to prepare properly for a siege, and the Persians arrived to a well-defended city. The Persians laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually they and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force sailed back to the mainland without a victory.

==Start of the Ionian Revolt (499 BC)==

With the failure of his attempt to conquer Naxos, Aristagoras found himself in dire straits; he was unable to repay Artaphernes, and had, moreover, alienated himself from the Persian royal family. He fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.

In autumn 499 BC, Aristagoras held a meeting with the members of his faction in Miletus. He declared that in his opinion the Milesians should revolt, to which all but the historian Hecataeus agreed. At the same time, a messenger sent by Histiaeus arrived in Miletus, imploring Aristagoras to rebel against Darius. Herodotus suggests that this was because Histiaeus was desperate to return to Ionia, and thought he would be sent to Ionia if there was a rebellion. Aristagoras therefore openly declared his revolt against Darius, abdicated from his role as tyrant, and declared Miletus to be a democracy. Herodotus has no doubt that this was only a pretence on Aristagoras&#x27;s part of giving up power. Rather it was designed to make the Milesians enthusiastically join the rebellion. The army that had been sent to Naxos was still assembled at Myus and included contingents from other Greek cities of Asia Minor (i.e. Aeolia and Doris) as well as men from Mytilene, Mylasa, Termera and Cyme. Aristagoras sent men to capture all the Greek tyrants present in the army and handed them over to their respective cities in order to gain the cooperation of those cities. Bury and Meiggs stated that the handovers were done without bloodshed with the exception of Mytilene, whose tyrant was stoned to death; tyrants elsewhere were simply banished. It has also been suggested (Herodotus does not explicitly say so) that Aristagoras incited the whole army to join his revolt, and also took possession of the ships that the Persians had supplied. If the latter is true, it may explain the length of time it took for the Persians to launch a naval assault on Ionia, since they would have needed to build a new fleet.

Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras and Histiaeus&#x27;s personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway. The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. Moreover, past tyrants had tended (and needed) to be strong and able leaders, whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians. Backed by Persian military might, these tyrants did not need the support of the population, and could thus rule absolutely. Aristagoras&#x27;s actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia, and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.

Aristagoras had brought all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently realised that the Greeks would need other allies in order to successfully fight the Persians. In the winter of 499 BC, he first sailed to Sparta, the pre-eminent Greek state in matters of war. However, despite Aristagoras&#x27;s entreaties, the Spartan king Cleomenes I turned down the offer to lead the Greeks against the Persians. Aristagoras therefore turned instead to Athens.

Athens had recently become a democracy, overthrowing its own tyrant Hippias. In their fight to establish the democracy, the Athenians had asked the Persians for aid (which was not in the end needed), in return for submitting to Persian overlordship. Some years later, Hippias had attempted to regain power in Athens, assisted by the Spartans. This attempt failed and Hippias fled to Artaphernes, and tried to persuade him to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians had balked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Since they were already an enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities in their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of the Athenian democracy no doubt helped persuade the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.

Aristagoras was also successful in persuading the city of Eretria to send assistance to the Ionians for reasons that are not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria some time previously, possibly referring to the Lelantine War. The Athenians sent twenty triremes to Miletus, reinforced by five from Eretria. Herodotus described the arrival of these ships as the beginning of troubles between Greeks and barbarians.

==Ionian offensive (498 BC)==

Over the winter, Aristagoras continued to foment rebellion. In one incident, he told a group of Paeonians (originally from Thrace), who Darius had brought to live in Phrygia, to return to their homeland. Herodotus says that his only purpose in doing this was to vex the Persian high command.

===Sardis===
In the spring of 498 BC, an Athenian force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from Eretria, set sail for Ionia. They joined up with the main Ionian force near Ephesus. Declining to personally lead the force, Aristagoras appointed his brother Charopinus and another Milesian, Hermophantus, as generals.

This force was then guided by the Ephesians through the mountains to Sardis, Artaphernes&#x27;s satrapal capital. The Greeks caught the Persians unaware, and were able to capture the lower city. However, Artaphernes still held the citadel with a significant force of men. The lower city then caught on fire, Herodotus suggests accidentally, which quickly spread. The Persians in the citadel, being surrounded by a burning city, emerged into the market-place of Sardis, where they fought with the Greeks, forcing them back. The Greeks, demoralised, then retreated from the city, and began to make their way back to Ephesus.

Herodotus reports that when Darius heard of the burning of Sardis, he swore vengeance upon the Athenians (after asking who they indeed were), and tasked a servant with reminding him three times each day of his vow: &quot;Master, remember the Athenians&quot;.

===Battle of Ephesus===
Herodotus says that when the Persians in Asia Minor heard of the attack on Sardis, they gathered together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability to catch up with the Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley of arrows.

It is clear that the demoralised and tired Greeks were no match for the Persians, and were completely routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus. Many were killed, including the Eretrian general, Eualcides. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships and sailed back to Greece.

===Spread of the revolt===
The Athenians now ended their alliance with the Ionians, since the Persians had proved to be anything but the easy prey that Aristagoras had described. However, the Ionians remained committed to their rebellion and the Persians did not seem to follow up their victory at Ephesus. Presumably these &quot;ad hoc&quot; forces were not equipped to lay siege to any of the cities. Despite the defeat at Ephesus, the revolt actually spread further. The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion.

==Persian counter-offensive (497–495 BC)==

Herodotus&#x27;s narrative after the Battle of Ephesus is ambiguous in its exact chronology; historians generally place Sardis and Ephesus in 498 BC. Herodotus next describes the spread of the revolt (thus also in 498 BC), and says that the Cypriots had one year of freedom, therefore placing the action in Cyprus to 497 BC. He next says that Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes, all of them Persian generals and married to daughters of Darius, pursued those Ionians who had marched to Sardis, and drove them to their ships. After this victory they divided the cities among themselves and sacked them. This passage implies these Persian generals counter-attacked &quot;immediately&quot; after the Battle of Ephesus. However, the cities that Herodotus describes Daurises as besieging were on the Hellespont, which (by Herodotus&#x27;s own reckoning) did not become involved in the revolt until &quot;after&quot; Ephesus. It is therefore easiest to reconcile the account by assuming that Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes waited until the next campaigning season (i.e., 497 BC), before going on the counter-offensive. The Persian actions that Herodotus described at the Hellespont and in Caria seem to be in the same year, and most commentators place them in 497 BC.

===Cyprus===
In Cyprus, all the kingdoms had revolted except that of Amathus. The leader of the Cypriot revolt was Onesilus, brother of the king of Salamis, Gorgus. Gorgus did not want to revolt, so Onesilus locked his brother out of the city and made himself king. Gorgus went over to the Persians, and Onesilus persuaded the other Cypriots, apart from the Amathusians, to revolt. He then settled down to besiege Amathus.

The following year (497 BC), Onesilus (still besieging Amathus), heard that a Persian force under Artybius had been dispatched to Cyprus. Onesilus thus sent messengers to Ionia, asking them to send reinforcements, which they did, &quot;in great force&quot;. A Persian army eventually arrived in Cyprus, supported by a Phoenician fleet. The Ionians opted to fight at sea and defeated the Phoenicians. In the simultaneous land battle outside Salamis, the Cypriots gained an initial advantage, killing Artybius. However, the defection of two contingents to the Persians crippled their cause, they were routed and Onesilus and Aristocyprus, king of Soli, were both killed. The revolt in Cyprus was thus crushed and the Ionians sailed home.

===Hellespont and Propontis===
The Persian forces in Asia Minor seem to have been reorganised in 497 BC, with three of Darius&#x27;s sons-in-law, Daurises, Hymaees, and Otanes, taking charge of three armies. Herodotus suggests that these generals divided up the rebellious lands between themselves and then set out to attack their respective areas.

Daurises, who seems to have had the largest army, initially took his army to the Hellespont. There, he systematically besieged and took the cities of Dardanus, Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus, and Paesus, each in a single day according to Herodotus. However, when he heard that the Carians were revolting, he moved his army southwards to attempt to crush this new rebellion. This places the timing of the Carian revolt to early 497 BC.

Hymaees went to the Propontis and took the city of Cius. After Daurises moved his forces towards Caria, Hymaees marched towards the Hellespont and captured many of the Aeolian cities as well as some of the cities in the Troad. However, he then fell ill and died, ending his campaign. Meanwhile, Otanes, together with Artaphernes, campaigned in Ionia (see below).

===Caria (496 BC)===
====Battle of the Marsyas====

Hearing that the Carians had rebelled, Daurises led his army south into Caria. The Carians gathered at the &quot;White Pillars&quot;, on the Marsyas River (the modern Çine), a tributary of the Meander. Pixodorus, a relative of the king of Cilicia, suggested that the Carians should cross the river and fight with it at their backs, so as to prevent retreat and thus make them fight more bravely. This idea was rejected and the Carians made the Persians cross the river to fight them. The ensuing battle was, according to Herodotus, a long affair, with the Carians fighting obstinately before eventually succumbing to the weight of Persian numbers. Herodotus suggests that 10,000 Carians and 2,000 Persians died in the battle.

====Battle of Labraunda====
The survivors of Marsyas fell back to a sacred grove of Zeus at Labraunda and deliberated whether to surrender to the Persians or to flee Asia altogether. However, while deliberating, they were joined by a Milesian army, and with these reinforcements resolved instead to carry on fighting. The Persians then attacked the army at Labraunda, and inflicted an even heavier defeat, with the Milesians suffering particularly bad casualties.

====Battle of Pedasus====
After the double victory over the Carians, Daurises began the task of reducing the Carian strongholds. The Carians resolved to fight on, and decided to lay an ambush for Daurises on the road through Pedasus.
Herodotus implies that this occurred more or less directly after Labraunda, but it has also been suggested that Pedasus occurred the following year (496 BC), giving the Carians time to regroup. The Persians arrived at Pedasus during the night, and the ambush was sprung to great effect. The Persian army was annihilated and Daurises and the other Persian commanders were slain. The disaster at Pedasus seems to have created a stalemate in the land campaign, and there was apparently little further campaigning in 496 BC and 495 BC.
===Ionia===
The third Persian army, under the command of Otanes and Artaphernes, attacked Ionia and Aeolia. They re-took Clazomenae and Cyme, probably in 497 BC, but then seem to have been less active in 496 BC and 495 BC, probably as a result of the calamity in Caria.

At the height of the Persian counter-offensive, Aristagoras, sensing his untenable position, decided to abandon his responsibilities as leader of Miletus and of the revolt. He left Miletus with all the members of his faction who would accompany him, and went to the part of Thrace that Darius had granted to Histiaeus after the campaign of 513 BC. Herodotus, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled. Some modern historians have suggested that he went to Thrace to exploit the greater natural resources of the region, and thus support the revolt. Others have suggested that finding himself at the centre of an internal conflict in Miletus, he chose to go into exile rather than exacerbate the situation.

In Thrace, he took control of the city that Histiaeus had founded, Myrcinus (site of the later Amphipolis), and started campaigning against the local Thracian population. However, during one campaign, probably in either 497 BC or 496 BC, he was killed by the Thracians. Aristagoras was the one man who might have been able to provide the revolt with a sense of purpose, but after his death the revolt was left effectively leaderless.

Shortly after this, Histiaeus was released from his duties in Susa by Darius and sent to Ionia. He had persuaded Darius to let him travel to Ionia by promising to make the Ionians end their revolt. However, Herodotus leaves us in no doubt that his real aim was simply to escape his quasi-captivity in Persia. When he arrived in Sardis, Artaphernes directly accused him of fomenting the rebellion with Aristagoras: &quot;I will tell you, Histiaeus, the truth of this business: it was you who stitched this shoe, and Aristagoras who put it on.&quot; Histiaeus fled that night to Chios and eventually made his way back to Miletus. However, having just got rid of one tyrant, the Milesians were in no mood to receive Histiaeus back. He therefore went to Mytilene in Lesbos and persuaded the Lesbians to give him eight triremes. He set sail for Byzantium with all those who would follow him. There he established himself, seizing all ships that attempted to sail through the Bosporus, unless they agreed to serve him.

==End of the revolt (494–493 BC)==

===Battle of Lade===
By the sixth year of the revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The available land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, along with Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre. The Median general Datis, an expert on Greek affairs, was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time. It is therefore possible that he was in overall command of this Persian offensive.

Hearing of the approach of this force, the Ionians met at the Panionium, and decided not to attempt to fight on land, leaving the Milesians to defend their walls. Instead, they opted to gather every ship they could and make for the island of Lade, off the coast of Miletus, in order to &quot;fight for Miletus at sea&quot;. The Ionians were joined by the Aeolian islanders from Lesbos, and altogether they had 353 triremes.

According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were concerned that they would not be able to defeat the Ionian fleet and, therefore, would not be able to take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians. This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.

Soon after, the Persian fleet moved to attack the Ionians, who sailed out to meet them. However, as the two sides neared each other, the Samians sailed away back to Samos, as they had agreed with the Persians. The Lesbians, seeing their neighbours in the battle-line sail away, promptly fled as well, causing the rest of the Ionian line to dissolve. The Chians, together with a small number of ships from other cities, stubbornly remained and fought the Persians, but most of the Ionians fled to their cities. The Chians fought valiantly, at one point breaking the Persian line and capturing many ships, but sustaining many losses of their own; eventually the remaining Chian ships sailed away, thereby ending the battle.

===Fall of Miletus===

With the defeat of the Ionian fleet, the revolt was effectively over. Miletus was closely invested, the Persians &quot;mining the walls and using every device against it, until they utterly captured it&quot;. According to Herodotus, most of the men were killed, and the women and children were enslaved. Archaeological evidence partially substantiates this, showing widespread signs of destruction, and abandonment of much of the city in the aftermath of Lade. However, some Milesians did remain in (or quickly returned to) Miletus, though the city would never recapture its former greatness.

Miletus was thus notionally &quot;left empty of Milesians&quot;; the Persians took the city and coastal land for themselves, and gave the rest of the Milesian territory to Carians from Pedasus. The captive Milesians were brought before Darius in Susa, who settled them at &quot;Ampé&quot; on the coast of the Persian Gulf, near the mouth of the Tigris.

Many Samians were appalled by the actions of their generals at Lade, and resolved to emigrate before their old tyrant, Aeaces of Samos, returned to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of Zancle to settle on the coast of Sicily, and took with them the Milesians who had managed to escape from the Persians. Samos itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade. Most of Caria now surrendered to the Persians, although some strongholds had to be captured through force.

===Histiaeus&#x27;s campaign (493 BC)===

====Chios====
When Histiaeus heard of the fall of Miletus, he seems to have appointed himself as leader of the resistance against Persia. Setting out from Byzantium with his force of Lesbians, he sailed to Chios. The Chians refused to receive him, so he attacked and destroyed the remnants of the Chian fleet. Crippled by the two defeats at sea, the Chians then acquiesced to Histiaeus&#x27;s leadership.

====Battle of Malene====
Histiaeus now gathered a large force of Ionians and Aeolians and went to besiege Thasos. However, he then received the news that the Persian fleet was setting out from Miletus to attack the rest of Ionia, so he quickly returned to Lesbos. In order to feed his army, he led foraging expeditions to the mainland near Atarneus and Myus. A large Persian force under Harpagus was in the area and eventually intercepted one foraging expedition near Malene. The ensuing battle was hard fought, but was ended by a successful Persian cavalry charge, routing the Greek line. Histiaeus himself surrendered to the Persians, thinking that he would be able to talk himself into a pardon from Darius. However, he was taken to Artaphernes instead, who, fully aware of Histiaeus&#x27;s past treachery, impaled him and then sent his embalmed head to Darius.

===Final operations (493 BC)===
The Persian fleet and army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp out the last embers of the revolt. They attacked and captured the islands of Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos. On each, they made a &#x27;human-net&#x27; of troops and swept across the whole island to flush out any hiding rebels. They then moved over to the mainland and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia, similarly seeking out any remaining rebels. Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus. Herodotus says that the Persians chose the most handsome boys from each city and castrated them, and chose the most beautiful girls and sent them away to the king&#x27;s harem, and then burnt the temples of the cities. While this is possibly true, Herodotus also probably exaggerates the scale of devastation. In a few years, the cities had more-or-less returned to normal and they were able to equip a large fleet for the second Persian invasion of Greece, just 13 years later.

The Persian army then re-conquered the settlements on the Asian side of the Propontis, while the Persian fleet sailed up the European coast of the Hellespont, taking each settlement in turn. With all of Asia Minor now firmly returned to Persian rule, the revolt was finally over.

==Aftermath==
Once the inevitable punishment of the rebels had occurred, the Persians were in the mood for conciliation. Since these regions were now Persian territory again, it made no sense to harm their economies further or to drive the people to further rebellions. Artaphernes thus set out to re-establish a workable relationship with his subjects. He summoned representatives from each Ionian city to Sardis, and told them that henceforth, rather than continually quarrelling and fighting between themselves, disputes would be resolved by arbitration, seemingly by a panel of judges. Furthermore, he re-surveyed the land of each city, and set their tribute level in proportion to its size. Artaphernes had also witnessed just how much the Ionians disliked tyrannies, and began to reconsider his position on the local governance of Ionia. The following year, Mardonius, another son-in-law of Darius, would travel to Ionia and abolish the tyrannies, replacing them with democracies. The peace established by Artaphernes would long be remembered as just and fair. Darius actively encouraged the Persian nobility of the area to participate in Greek religious practices, especially those dealing with Apollo. Records from the period indicate that the Persian and Greek nobility began to intermarry, and the children of Persian nobles were given Greek names instead of Persian names. Darius&#x27; conciliatory policies were used as a type of propaganda campaign against the mainland Greeks, so that in 491 BC, when Darius sent heralds throughout Greece demanding submission (earth and water), initially most city-states accepted the offer, Athens and Sparta being the most prominent exceptions.

For the Persians, the only unfinished business that remained by the end of 493 BC was to exact punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius&#x27;s empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria.

Therefore, the first Persian invasion of Greece effectively began in the following year, 492 BC, when Mardonius was dispatched (via Ionia) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece and push on to Athens and Eretria if possible. Thrace was re-subjugated, having broken loose from Persian rule during the revolts and Macedon compelled to become a vassal of Persia. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster. A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes. This amphibious force sailed across the Aegean, subjugating the Cyclades, before arriving off Euboea. Eretria was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto Attica. Landing at the Bay of Marathon, they were met by an Athenian army and defeated in the famous Battle of Marathon, ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece.

==Significance==

The Ionian Revolt was primarily of significance as the opening chapter in, and causative agent of, the Greco-Persian Wars, which included the two invasions of Greece and the famous battles of Marathon, Thermopylae and Salamis. For the Ionian cities themselves, the revolt ended in failure, and substantial losses, both material and economic. However, Miletus aside, they recovered relatively quickly and prospered under Persian rule for the next forty years. For the Persians, the revolt was significant in drawing them into an extended conflict with the states of Greece which would last for fifty years, over which time they would sustain considerable losses.

Militarily, it is difficult to draw too many conclusions from the Ionian Revolt, save for what the Greeks and Persians may (or may not) have learnt about each other. Certainly, the Athenians, and Greeks in general, seem to have been impressed by the power of Persian cavalry, with the Greek armies displaying considerable caution during the following campaigns when confronted by the Persian cavalry. Conversely, the Persians seem not to have realised or noticed the potential of the Greek hoplites as heavy infantry. At the Battle of Marathon, in 490 BC, the Persians took little heed of a primarily hoplitic army, resulting in their defeat. Furthermore, despite the possibility of recruiting heavy infantry from their domains, the Persians began the second invasion of Greece without doing so, and again encountered major problems in the face of Greek armies. It is possible that, given the ease of their victories over the Greeks at Ephesus, and similarly armed forces at the battles of the Marsyas River and Labraunda, the Persians simply disregarded the military value of the hoplite phalanx—to their cost.

===Manville&#x27;s theory of a power struggle between Aristagoras and Histiaeus===
Herodotus’ account is the best source available on the events that amounted to a collision between Persia, which was expanding westward, and classical Greece at its peak. Nevertheless, its depictions are often scanty and uncertain, or incomplete. One of the major uncertainties of the Ionian revolt in Herodotus is why it occurred in the first place.

In retrospect the case seems obvious: Persia disputed the Hellenes for control of cities and territories. The Hellenes had either to fight for their freedom or submit. The desirability of these material objects was certainly economic, although considerations of defence and ideology may well have played a part. These are the motives generally accepted today, after long retrospect.

Herodotus apparently knew of no such motives, or if he did, he did not care to analyse history at that level. P. B. Manville characterises his approach as the attribution of &quot;personal motivation&quot; to players such as Aristagoras and Histiaeus. In his view, Herodotus &quot;may seem to overemphasise personal motivation as a cause,&quot; but he really does not. We have either to fault Herodotus for his lack of analytical perspicacity or try to find credible reasons in the historical context for actions to which Herodotus gives incomplete explanations.

Manville suggests that the unexplained places mark events in a secret scenario about which Herodotus could not have known, but he records what he does know faithfully. It is up to the historian to reconstruct the secret history by re-interpretation and speculation, a technique often used by historical novelists. Manville puts it forward as history.

The main players are portrayed by Herodotus as naturally hypocritical. They always have an ulterior motive which they go to great lengths to conceal behind persuasive lies. Thus neither Aristagoras nor Histiaeus are fighting for freedom, nor do they cooperate or collaborate. Each has a personal motive related to greed, ambition, or fear. Manville fills in the uncertainties with hypothetical motives. Thus he arrives, perhaps less credibly for his invention, at a behind-the-scenes struggle for dominance between Aristagoras and Histiaeus. They can best be described as rivals or even enemies. Some of the high points of the argument are as follows.

While Histiaeus was away serving Darius, Aristagoras acted in his stead as deputy of Miletus where, it is argued, he worked on securing his own power. The word for deputy is epitropos, which he was when the Naxian deputation arrived. By the time the fleet departs for Naxos, Aristagoras has promoted himself to &quot;tyrant of Miletus.&quot; There is no explicit statement that he asked Histiaeus&#x27; permission or was promoted by Histaeus. Instead, Aristagoras turned to Artaphernes, who was said to be jealous of Histiaeus. It is true that Artaphernes would not move without consulting the Great King, and that the latter&#x27;s advisor on Greek affairs was Histiaeus. However, Manville sees a coup by Aristagoras, presuming not only that the Great King&#x27;s advisor did not advise, but was kept in the dark about his own supersession.

When the expedition failed, Histiaeus sent his tattooed slave to Aristagoras, not as encouragement to revolt, but as an ultimatum. Manville provides an underlying value system to fill in the gap left by Herodotus: revolt was so unthinkable that Histiaeus could bring the fantasies of his opponent back to reality by suggesting that he do it, a sort of &quot;go ahead, commit suicide.&quot; Histiaeus was, in Manville&#x27;s speculation, ordering Aristagoras to give up his rule or suffer the consequences. Apparently, he was not being kept in the dark by the king after all. Manville leaves us to guess why the king did not just crush the revolt by returning the supposedly loyal Histiaeus to power.

However, at this time Histiaeus was still required to remain in Susa and, despite his threat, he was unable to do anything if Aristagoras did revolt. Realising that this would be his last chance to gain power Aristagoras started the revolt despite Histiaeus&#x27; threat. This is a surprise to Manville&#x27;s readers, as we thought he already had power via a coup. Manville does note the contradiction mentioned above, that Aristagoras gave up tyranny, yet was able to force democracy on the other cities and command their obedience to him. We are to see in this paradox a strategy to depose Histiaeus, whom we thought was already deposed.

The tale goes on to an attempt by Histiaeus to form an alliance with Artaphernes to depose the usurper and regain his power at Miletus. Artaphernes, though he was involved in open war with Aristagoras, refuses. The tale told by Manville thus contains events related by Herodotus supplemented by non-events coming from Manville&#x27;s imagination.

===Myres&#x27; Theory of a balance of power between thalassocracies===
John Myres, classical archaeologist and scholar, whose career began in the reign of Queen Victoria and did not end until 1954, close friend and companion of Arthur Evans, and intelligence officer par excellence of the British Empire, developed a theory of the Ionian Revolt that explains it in terms of the stock political views of the empire, balance of power and power vacuum. Those views, still generally familiar, assert that peace is to be found in a region controlled by competing geopolitical powers, none of which are strong enough to defeat the others. If a power drops from the roster for any reason, a &quot;vacuum&quot; then exists, which causes violent competition until the balance is readjusted.

In a key article of 1906, while Evans was excavating Knossos, the Ottoman Empire had lost Crete due to British intervention, and questions of the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; were being considered by all the powers. Referring to the failing Ottoman Empire and the power vacuum that would be left when it fell, the young Myres published an article studying the balance of what he termed &quot;sea-power&quot; in the eastern Mediterranean in classical times. The word &quot;sea-power&quot; was intended to define his &quot;thalassocracy.&quot;

Myres was using sea-power in a specifically British sense for the times. The Americans had their own idea of sea power, expressed in Alfred Thayer Mahan&#x27;s great strategic work, &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History&quot;. which advocated maintaining a powerful navy and using it for strategic purposes, such as &quot;command of the sea,&quot; a kind of domination. The United States Naval Academy used this meaning for its motto, &quot;ex scientia tridens&quot;, &quot;sea-power through knowledge.&quot; It named one of its buildings, Mahan Hall.

Far different is Myres&#x27; &quot;sea-power&quot; and the meaning of thalassocracy, which means &quot;rule of the seas.&quot; In contrast to &quot;tridens,&quot; rule of the seas is not a paternalistic but democratic arrangement. Where there are rulers, there are the ruled. A kind of exclusivity is meant, such as in Rule, Britannia!. Specifically, in a thalassocracy, the fleets of the ruler may go where they will and do as they please, but the ruled may go nowhere and engage in no operation without express permission of the ruler. You need a license, so to speak, to be on ruled waters, and if you do not have it, your ships are attacked and destroyed. &quot;Shoot on sight&quot; is the policy. And so Carthaginian ships sank any ships in their waters, etc.

====The list of thalassocracies====
Thalassocracy was a new word in the theories of the late 19th century, from which some conclude it was a scholarly innovation of the times. It was rather a resurrection of a word known from a very specific classical document, which Myres calls &quot;the List of Thalassocracies.&quot; It occurs in the Chronicon of Eusebius, the early 4th century Bishop of Caesarea Maritima, the ruins now in Israel. In Eusebius, the list is a separate chronology. Jerome, 4th-century theologian and historian, creator of the Vulgate, interspersed the same items, translated into Latin, in his Chronicon of world events. The items contain the words &quot;obtinuerunt mare,&quot; strictly speaking, &quot;obtained the sea,&quot; and not &quot;hold sea power,&quot; although the latter meaning may be implied as a result. Just as Jerome utilised the chronology of Eusebius, so Eusebius utilised the chronology of Castor of Rhodes, a 1st-century BC historian. His work has been entirely lost except for fragments, including his list of thalassocracies. A thousand years later, the Byzantine monk, George Syncellus, also used items from the list in his massive &quot;Extract of Chronography&quot;.

Over the centuries the realisation grew that all these references to sea-power in the Aegean came from a single document, a resource now reflected in the fragments of those who relied on it. C Bunsen, whose translator was one of the first to use thalassocracy, attributed its discovery to the German scholar, Christian Gottlob Heyne In a short work composed in 1769, published in 1771, Eusebius’ Chronicon being known at that time only through fragments in the two authors mentioned, Heyne reconstructed the list in their Greek and Latin (with uncanny accuracy), the whole title of the article being &quot;Super Castoris epochis populorum thalattokratesanton H.E. (hoc est) qui imperium maris tenuisse dicuntur&quot;, &quot;About Castor&#x27;s epochs of thalattocratizing peoples; that is, those who are said to have held the imperium over the sea.&quot; To thalattokratize is “to rule the sea,” not just to hold sea power like any other good fellow with a strong navy. The thalattokratizer holds the imperium over the watery domain just as if it were a country, which explains how such a people can &quot;obtain&quot; and &quot;have&quot; the sea. The list presented therefore is one of successive exclusive domains. No two peoples can hold the same domain or share rule over it, although they can operate under the authority of the thalassocrat, a privilege reserved for paying allies.

According to Bunsen, the discovery and translation of the Armenian version of Eusebius&#x27; Chronicon changed the nature of the search for thalassocracy. It provided the original document, but there was a disclaimer attached, that it was in fact &quot;an extract from the epitome of Diodorus,&quot; meaning Diodorus Siculus, a 1st-century BC historian. The disclaimer cannot be verified, as that part of Diodorus&#x27; work is missing, which, however, opens the argument to another question: if Eusebius could copy a standard source from Diodorus, why cannot Diodorus have copied it from someone else?

It is at this point that Myres picks up the argument. Noting that thalassokratesai, &quot;be a thalassocrat,&quot; meaning &quot;rule the waves,&quot; was used in a number of authors: elsewhere by Diodorus, by Polybius, 2nd century BC historian, of Carthage, of Chios by Strabo, 1st century BC geographer and some others, he supposes that the source document might have been available to them all (but not necessarily, the cautious Myres points out). The document can be dated by its content: a list of 17 thalassocracies extending from the Lydian after the fall of Troy to the Aeginetan, which ended with the cession of power to Athens in 480 BC. The Battle of Salamis included 200 new Athenian triremes plus all the ships of its new ally, Aegina. Despite various revolts Aegina went on to become part of the Delian League, an imperial treaty of the new Athenian thalassocracy. Thucydides writes of it after 432 BC, but Herodotus, who visited Athens &quot;as late as 444 B.C.&quot; does not know a thing about it. This tentative date for the Eusebian list does not exclude the possibility of an earlier similar document used by Herodotus.

====Myres&#x27; historical reconstruction of the list====
The order of thalassocracies in the various versions of the list is nearly fixed, but the dates need considerable adjustment, which Myres sets about to reconcile through all historical sources available to him. He discovers some gaps. The solidest part of the list brackets the Ionian Revolt. The Milesian thalassocracy is dated 604-585 BC. It was ended by Alyattes of Lydia, founder of the Lydian Empire, who also fought against the Medes. The latter struggle was ended by the Eclipse of Thales at the Battle of the Halys River in 585 BC, when the combatants, interpreting the phenomenon as a sign, made peace. The Lydians were now free to turn on Miletus, which they did for the next 11 years, reducing it. When the Persians conquered Lydia in 547/546 they acquired the Ionian cities.

After 585 BC there is a gap in the list. Lesbos and one or more unknown thalassocrats held the sea in unknown order. In 577 BC began the thalassocracy of Phocaea. Breaking out of its Anatolian cage, it founded Marseilles and cities in Spain and Italy, wresting a domain away from Carthage and all other opponents. Their thalassocracy ended when, in the revolt of the Lydian Pactyas, who had been instructed to collect taxes by the Persians, but used them to raise an army of revolt, the Ionian cities were attacked by the Persians. The Phocaeans abandoned Phocaea about 534 BC and after much adventuring settled in the west.

The thalassocracy of Samos spans the career of the tyrant, Polycrates, there. The dates of the tyrant are somewhat uncertain and variable, but at some time prior to 534 BC, he and his brothers staged a coup during a festival at Samos. Samos happened to have a large navy of pentekonters. Becoming a ship collector, he attacked and subdued all the neighbouring islands, adding their ships to his fleet. Finally he added a new model, the trireme. His reign came to an end about 517 BC when, taking up the Great King&#x27;s invitation to a friendly banquet for a discussion of prospects, he was suddenly assassinated. There were no prospects.

However, if he had chosen not to attend, he was doomed anyway. Some of his trireme captains, learning of a devious plot by him to have them assassinated by Egyptian dignitaries while on official business, sailed to Sparta to beg help, which they received. The adventurous young king, Cleomenes I, was spared the trouble of killing Polycrates, but led an expedition to Samos anyway, taking the thalassocracy for two years, 517-515. Adventure and piracy not being activities approved by the Spartan people, they tagged him as insane and insisted he come home. The sea was now available to Naxos, 515-505.

==In modern literature==
Gore Vidal describes the Ionian Revolt in his historical novel &quot;Creation&quot;, presenting events from the Persian point of view. Vidal suggests that the Ionian Revolt might have had far-reaching results not perceived by the Greeks, i.e., that King Darius had contemplated an extensive campaign of conquest in India, coveting the wealth of its kingdoms, and that this Indian campaign was aborted due to the Persians needing their military resources on the western side of their empire.

<text>The Battle of Prairie Grove was a battle of the American Civil War fought on December 7, 1862. While tactically indecisive, the battle secured the Union control of northwestern Arkansas.

A division of Union troops in the Army of the Frontier, commanded by James G. Blunt, was posted in northwestern Arkansas after winning the Battle of Cane Hill on November 28. The First Corps, Trans-Mississippi Army, commanded by Thomas C. Hindman moved towards Blunt&#x27;s division in order to attack while it was isolated. However, Blunt was reinforced by two divisions commanded by Francis J. Herron, leading Hindman to take a defensive position on some high ground known as Prairie Grove. Herron attempted to assault Hindman&#x27;s lines twice, but both attacks were beaten off with heavy casualties. Hindman responded to the repulse of each of Herron&#x27;s attacks with unsuccessful counterattacks of his own. Later in the day, Blunt arrived and attacked Hindman&#x27;s flank. Eventually, both sides disengaged and the fighting reached an inconclusive result. However, the unavailability of reinforcements forced Hindman&#x27;s army to retreat from the field, giving the Union army a strategic victory and control of northwestern Arkansas.

Union forces reported suffering 1,251 casualties (including 175 dead); Confederate forces reported 1,317 casualties (between 164 and 204 dead). Confederate forces suffered from severe demoralization, and many conscripts deserted. The Confederates had to leave many of their dead on the field, in piles and surrounded with makeshift barriers to keep feral pigs from eating the corpses. Today, most of the battlefield is preserved within Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park.

==Background==
In March 1862, a Confederate army under the command of Earl Van Dorn engaged a Union army led by Samuel Ryan Curtis at the Battle of Pea Ridge in northwestern Arkansas. Curtis&#x27; army soundly defeated Van Dorn&#x27;s. After being defeated at Pea Ridge, Van Dorn and a substantial portion of his army were reassigned across the Mississippi River, effectively ending Confederate control of the region.

Following Pea Ridge, Curtis drove further into Arkansas and planned to attack Memphis, but was ordered by Henry Halleck to send half of his force to Cape Girardeau for transfer to Tennessee. Curtis complied and was forced to abandon his plan, instead heading towards Little Rock. After a defeat in a small action near Searcy, Curtis decided that his supply line was vulnerable, and fell back, eventually reaching Helena.

In September, Curtis was assigned to command the Department of the Missouri, replacing its previous commander, John M. Schofield. Curtis later formed the Army of the Frontier and appointed Schofield to command the new army on October 12. However, on November 20, Schofield was forced to give up command of the army due to medical issues, and command passed to Brigadier General James G. Blunt. At the time of Schofield&#x27;s relinquishment of command, Blunt&#x27;s division was in Arkansas, while the rest of the Army of the Frontier was stationed near Wilson&#x27;s Creek in Missouri, where a battle had been fought the year before.

The Confederate commander in the region, Thomas C. Hindman, had previously commanded the Trans-Mississippi Department, but his firm control of the region led to protests from prominent Arkansas civilians, leading Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States, to relieve Hindman of command and replace him with Theophilus Holmes. On August 21, Holmes tasked Hindman with producing an organized army from the Confederate units in the Arkansas region and moving to regain control of Missouri for the Confederacy.

In October, Blunt&#x27;s force made an incursion into Arkansas, and Hindman sent 2,000 men under Marmaduke&#x27;s command to intercept Blunt and prevent him from joining the main Union force near Springfield, Missouri. Marmaduke gathered at Cane Hill, a ridge near the Boston Mountains. In response, Blunt marched his troops in two days, meeting Marmaduke&#x27;s force near Canehill. In the ensuing Battle of Cane Hill, which took place on November 28, Blunt&#x27;s 5,000 men defeated Marmaduke&#x27;s 2,000 in a nine-hour battle.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===
At the beginning of the Prairie Grove campaign, the Union Army of the Frontier was commanded by Schofield. Schofield&#x27;s army was divided into three divisions, commanded by Blunt, James Totten, and Herron. Blunt&#x27;s division was known as the &quot;Kansas Division&quot;, as many of the soldiers in the division were from Kansas. The division also contained sizable numbers of African American and Native American soldiers, which made Blunt&#x27;s division unique among Union units in 1862. Totten&#x27;s and Herron&#x27;s divisions were both known as &quot;Missouri Division&quot;, and contained men from Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Indiana. The division also contained a regiment of Arkansas cavalrymen who had remained loyal to the Union despite the secession of Arkansas.

===Confederate===
The Confederate army present at Prairie Grove was the First Corps, Trans-Mississippi Army, commanded by Hindman. Hindman&#x27;s command was formed of four divisions: one of cavalry, two of infantry, and a mixed reserve division. The cavalry division consisted of men from Arkansas, Texas, and Confederate Missouri, and was commanded by Marmaduke. Marmaduke&#x27;s division was poorly armed. Of the army&#x27;s two infantry divisions, one was commanded by Daniel M. Frost and the other by Francis Shoup. Shoup&#x27;s division consisted of Arkansas infantrymen, while Frost&#x27;s division was mostly Missourians, although some Arkansas troops were included. The reserve division was commanded by John S. Roane, and was poorly equipped, organized, and led (Holmes stated that Roane was &quot;useless as a commander&quot;). Of Hindman and his division commanders, all had previous military experience. In particular, Hindman, Frost, and Roane had all seen action in the Mexican War.

==Maneuvering to battle==

===Hindman&#x27;s offensive===

After the Battle of Cane Hill, Hindman decided to send his entire army towards Cane Hill in order to assault Blunt. If all went according to Hindman&#x27;s plan, he would be able to assault Blunt&#x27;s position from both the front and along both flanks. At this time, Union forces menaced the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg, Mississippi. On November 11, the Confederate government ordered Holmes to send 10,000 troops to reinforce Vicksburg. Holmes replied that two-thirds of his troops were in northwest Arkansas to oppose a Federal threat. Even so, he ordered Hindman to bring his troops to Little Rock. Holmes tried to dissuade Hindman from his plan to attack Blunt and the two generals engaged in an argument over the telegraph. Hindman had a forceful personality and won the argument with Holmes. By December 1, Hindman had gathered between 11,000 and 12,000 troops near Van Buren. The Confederate infantry and artillery moved out of their camps on December 3.

Blunt&#x27;s intelligence services alerted him to Hindman&#x27;s preparations by the evening of December 2; a courier immediately set out for the telegraph station at Elkhorn Tavern. The messages included a situation report for Curtis in St Louis and an urgent request for Totten to send reinforcements. Blunt prepared to defend himself by posting William Weer&#x27;s 2nd Brigade and William F. Cloud&#x27;s 3rd Brigade on high ground south of Newburg with elements of Frederick Salomon&#x27;s 1st Brigade watching Hogeye Road. A cavalry outpost was set up on Cove Creek Road to watch for Hindman&#x27;s advance. Every morning from December 3 to 6, Blunt had his troops on the alert, with wagons packed and ready to move quickly.

On November 27, Curtis ordered Totten back to St Louis to be a witness at a court-martial. The unpopular Totten&#x27;s departure pleased his soldiers and Daniel Huston Jr. assumed command of the 2nd Division. Within a few hours of receiving Blunt&#x27;s telegraphed call for help, on the morning of December 4, Herron started the 2nd and 3rd divisions on &quot;an epic of human endurance&quot;. From the afternoon of December 3 to the morning of December 7, Huston&#x27;s and Herron&#x27;s divisions marched respectively. Herron&#x27;s two divisions averaged per day over rough roads in intensely cold weather with short stops to eat and sleep. In the early hours of December 6, Herron received a message from Blunt asking for cavalry. Herron promptly dispatched Dudley Wickersham with a 1,600-man provisional cavalry brigade which reached Blunt at 9:00pm that same day after a march.

===Hindman&#x27;s new plan===
On December 5, Joseph O. Shelby&#x27;s 1,200-man Confederate cavalry brigade began pressing back the 400 troopers of the 2nd Kansas Volunteer Cavalry Regiment that guarded the Cove Creek Road. Blunt knew that if Hindman continued to use Cove Creek Road, it would be easy for him to cut off the Confederate retreat route. Blunt assumed correctly that Hindman intended to turn to the west and approach Newburg. However, Hindman&#x27;s plan would change. The bad weather slowed down the march of Hindman&#x27;s soldiers, so he postponed his planned attack until December 7. He believed that the nearest Union forces were near Springfield, but what he did not know was that Blunt anticipated the Confederate offensive and that Union reinforcements were approaching.

On December 6, near mid-day, the 2nd Kansas Cavalry abandoned its blocking position on Cove Creek Road and withdrew northwest toward Newburg. That afternoon, James C. Monroe&#x27;s Confederate cavalry brigade, supported by other units, skirmished with the 2nd Kansas Cavalry on Reed&#x27;s Mountain. By nightfall Monroe&#x27;s troopers occupied that terrain feature on the road to Newburg. That evening, Hindman and his commanders received startling intelligence that Herron&#x27;s two divisions would reach Blunt the following day. Hindman realized that attacking Blunt at Newburg would simply push him back toward Herron&#x27;s reinforcements. The Confederate commander knew that marching back to Van Buren would demoralize his soldiers, so he changed his plan. Hindman&#x27;s new plan called for the army to march north on Cove Creek Road to Prairie Grove. At that location he would first crush Herron&#x27;s force, then swing around and smash Blunt. The risk was that Hindman might be caught between the two Union forces if Blunt found out what was happening. At 4:00am on December 7, the Confederate army began to march north along Cove Creek Road. Shelby&#x27;s cavalry brigade was in the lead.

===Morning clashes===
Early on December 7, Marmaduke&#x27;s 2,000 cavalrymen reached Prairie Grove and discovered 650 Union troopers of the 6th Missouri and 7th Missouri Volunteer Cavalry regiments nearby. Helped by the fact that many Confederates wore captured blue uniforms, Shelby&#x27;s troopers surprised and routed their opponents, especially the 7th Missouri. The Union 1st Arkansas Cavalry Regiment soon appeared on the Fayetteville Road and was also routed when the Missourians fled through their ranks and Shelby&#x27;s Confederates charged into them, as was the 6th Missouri and 8th Missouri Cavalry Regiment (Union). The Confederate pursuit continued east past the Illinois River, but ended when it encountered the leading elements of Herron&#x27;s main column. Shelby was briefly captured, then rescued during a melee with the 1st Missouri Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. During the early morning action, Marmaduke&#x27;s horsemen inflicted casualties of 10 killed, 19 wounded, and 262 captured on the Union cavalry and seized 21 wagons. Herron&#x27;s approaching infantry ignored the panicked Union horsemen and its bold front convinced Marmaduke to pull back to the west side of the river.

By the time Frost&#x27;s 6,300-strong division reached Prairie Grove, Hindman had lost his nerve and set up a defensive line. The Confederate commander might have attacked Herron at once with Frost&#x27;s powerful division. Fearing that Blunt might intervene, Hindman ordered Frost to face southwest and block the Fayetteville Road. While Hindman waited for Shoup&#x27;s Arkansas division, Herron had time to push Marmaduke out of his way and reach the Illinois River. When Shoup&#x27;s 3,200 soldiers arrived at 10:00 am, Shoup assumed a defensive position on the high ground at Prairie Grove. After directing the deployment of Frost&#x27;s troops, Hindman returned to Prairie Grove. He scolded Shoup for not attacking Herron, but allowed the Arkansas soldiers to remain in position.

===Blunt&#x27;s march===
When Hindman&#x27;s army started north on Cove Creek Road, Monroe&#x27;s 400 Confederate horsemen were left at Reed&#x27;s Mountain to deceive Blunt, while Hindman&#x27;s main force proceeded against Herron. In the early morning, a Union officer detected Hindman&#x27;s column marching along the Cove Creek Road. This information was reported to Union headquarters, but Blunt was not there and the critical message was not forwarded for two hours. At about 9:00 am, Blunt was at Newburg expecting to be attacked when he finally realized that Hindman&#x27;s army was no longer there. By 10:00am Blunt had gotten his division marching north on Fayetteville Road. Blunt sent William R. Judson with 400 cavalry and two M1841 mountain howitzers up the Cove Creek Road. Judson&#x27;s column got within of Prairie Grove and fired its howitzers for 30 minutes, but withdrew when confronted by superior forces.

Wickersham&#x27;s provisional cavalry brigade led Blunt&#x27;s column as it hurried north on the Fayetteville Road. Believing that Rhea&#x27;s Mill was his destination, Wickersham turned his brigade onto Bottom Road. By the time Blunt realized what had happened, his division was marching toward Rhea&#x27;s Mill. Wickersham&#x27;s mistake turned out to Blunt&#x27;s advantage because it brought his division to the battlefield by the least obstructed route. By 1:00pm Blunt&#x27;s division reached Rhea&#x27;s Mill where the soldiers rested. A half-hour later, Wickersham headed east on the Viney Grove Road toward Prairie Grove where the thunder of cannon was heard. Salomon&#x27;s brigade stayed at Rhea&#x27;s Mill guarding the wagon train. By 2:30pm the infantry followed the cavalry. Since the countryside was flat, the different regiments spontaneously quit the road and set out cross-country at a rapid pace.

==Battle==

On December 7, the Confederate divisions of Shoup and Marmaduke aligned along the length of Prairie Grove. Later that morning, Herron&#x27;s Union division reached the field, and, not suspecting that he faced a substantial portion of the Confederate army, opened up an artillery bombardment. Herron was soon joined by Huston&#x27;s division. Only about 3,500 men, half of the men of the two divisions, were fit to take the field after the grueling march to reach the battlefield. After Herron and Huston had fully deployed their troops, Herron reopened the artillery barrage, which had paused earlier. The Confederate artillery attempted to respond, but their cannons were of inferior quality and lacked the range to properly respond. In addition, the Confederates were also short of artillery ammunition. As a result, the Union gunners were able to wreak havoc in the Confederate line.

Confident after watching the result of the artillery bombardment, Herron sent his two brigades, commanded by Colonel William W. Orme and Lieutenant Colonel Henry Bertram, towards the Confederate line near a farm owned by Archibald Borden. Herron&#x27;s troops made contact with the main Confederate line and the 20th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment and the 19th Iowa Infantry Regiment overran a Confederate artillery battery. However, a counterattack by elements from the brigades of James F. Fagan and Dandridge McRae (both of Shoup&#x27;s Confederate division) drove off the Wisconsin unit, and brigade commander Bertram was wounded. After the repulse of Bertram&#x27;s attack, some of Orme&#x27;s men joined in the fight, only to be driven off. An abortive Confederate counterattack was then driven off by Herron&#x27;s artillery. The two Union regiments that were the hardest engaged—Bertram&#x27;s 20th Wisconsin and Orme&#x27;s 19th Iowa—both suffered losses of approximately fifty percent.

After the defeat of Herron&#x27;s division, Huston deployed some of his men into the fray. The 26th Indiana attacked Marmaduke&#x27;s Confederate cavalry, and were driven off by a force that included Shelby&#x27;s brigade and Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders. Huston ordered the 37th Illinois to charge towards the Borden house, and the Illinois soldiers experienced initial success. However, a Confederate counterattack drove the 37th Illinois back to the main Union line. Fagan and Shelby led their men further on towards Herron&#x27;s main line, and the two brigades were joined by a third under Emmett MacDonald. This attack was also defeated, as the combined fire of Herron&#x27;s artillery and the survivors of Orme&#x27;s brigade broke the Confederate assault.

Wickersham&#x27;s 1,600 Union cavalry reached the battlefield, followed at 3:15pm by Blunt with his staff and escort. A messenger from Blunt soon alerted Herron that his division was coming. As the news spread, Herron&#x27;s men gave a cheer. Blunt opened fire on the Confederate army with 30 cannons. Hindman responded by ordering Frost to use his division to counter Blunt. Frost, in turn, sent a brigade commanded by Mosby M. Parsons to the left of Shoup&#x27;s position. A brigade of dismounted Texas cavalry from Roane&#x27;s command was also sent to the front, forming to the left of Parsons&#x27; brigade. Blunt&#x27;s forces then prepared to attack the new Confederate left, strengthened by the addition of the 20th Iowa, one of Huston&#x27;s Union regiments. The 20th Iowa and the First Indian Home Guard assaulted the Confederate line, only to be repulsed. The Confederates responded to the abortive Union assault with another counterattack, using several of McRae&#x27;s brigade.

Further down the line, Weer&#x27;s Union brigade began advancing towards Parsons&#x27; line. In response, Parsons moved his brigade forward from his original position, creating a confused fight between the two armies&#x27; main lines. Eventually, Parsons realized that his line was longer than Weer&#x27;s, and pushed hard on both flanks of the Union position. Weer was forced to retreat, and Parsons began a counterattack. This attack was driven off by Blunt&#x27;s massed artillery. As darkness fell, both sides gradually disengaged. While Hindman still held the field, he had no reinforcements and was running out of ammunition. Meanwhile, the Union armies had been reinforced by trailing elements of Herron&#x27;s command. The Confederate army was forced to withdraw from the field, suffering many losses to desertion in the process. While the fighting was inconclusive, the Confederate withdrawal gave the Union a strategic victory.

==Aftermath==
Union forces reported suffering 1,251 casualties, including 175 dead, 813 wounded, and 263 missing. Confederate forces reported 1,317 casualties, including 164 dead, 817 wounded, and 336 missing. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Arkansas&quot; gives slightly different casualty numbers: 175 killed, 808 wounded, and 250 missing for the Union and 204 killed, 872 wounded, and 407 missing for the Confederates. These reported totals may be too low, as slightly wounded soldiers were not often counted. In addition, Confederate forces suffered from severe demoralization and lost many conscript soldiers during and after the campaign to desertion. The Confederates were forced to leave many of their dead on the field, and had to pile the bodies into heaps and surround them with makeshift barriers to keep feral pigs from eating the corpses. The retreat of the Confederate forces from the field gave Union forces control of northwestern Arkansas.

On December 23, Blunt learned that Schofield was on his way to rejoin the army and take overall command. Blunt and Herron decided to attempt one last strike at Hindman&#x27;s Confederate army before Schofield, who was concerned about the potential of Holmes reinforcing the Confederate&#x27;s army, arrived. Hindman had made his camp in the vicinity of Van Buren, and Blunt and Herron reached Van Buren on December 29. In the Battle of Van Buren, Blunt&#x27;s Union forces drove off Hindman&#x27;s Confederates in disarray, and the remains of the Confederate army left the area.

==Battlefield preservation==
Some of the battlefield area is preserved in Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park, ten miles from Fayetteville. The state park contains over of the battlefield. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield as of mid-2023. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

<doc id="298701" wikidata="Q3014237" url="?curid=298701" title="Daniel Johnson Jr.">
<text>Daniel Johnson Jr. (born December 24, 1944) is a former Canadian politician. He was a member of the Liberal Party of Quebec and was the 25th premier of Quebec for nine months in 1994 until his party&#x27;s defeat in the provincial general election.

==Life and career==
Johnson was born in Montreal, Quebec. He is the son of Reine Gagné and Daniel Johnson Sr., who had been the Premier of Quebec from 1966 to his death in 1968, as the leader of the &quot;Union Nationale&quot;, a conservative political party. His brother is Pierre-Marc Johnson, Parti Québécois leader from 1985 to 1987 and Premier of Quebec from October 3 to December 12, 1985.

Johnson received his Bachelor of Laws degree from the Université de Montréal in 1966. He also received LL.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the University College London in 1968 and 1971 respectively, as well as a Master of Business Administration from the Harvard Business School in 1973. Johnson immediately began his career in the business world and worked for Power Corporation of Canada from 1973 to 1981. He served as the Vice-President of Power Corp. from 1978 to 1981. During that period, Daniel Johnson was active in the Montreal community, acting as Vice-president of the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, and sat on other non-profit boards, such as the Montreal Heart Institute and the Grands Ballets Canadiens.

==Political career==
Johnson was first elected to the National Assembly of Quebec in the riding of Vaudreuil-Soulanges in the 1981 Quebec general election. He ran for the 1983 Quebec Liberal Party leadership convention but finished third behind Pierre Paradis and winner Robert Bourassa. He was re-elected in the 1985 election, which brought the Liberals to power. He became Minister of Industry and Commerce in the Quebec government, and was Chairman of the Treasury Board from June 1988 until January 1994.

In January 1994, he became leader of the Quebec Liberal Party and Premier of Quebec following the resignation of Liberal leader Robert Bourassa. He then lost the 1994 provincial election to Jacques Parizeau of the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot;.

During the 1995 Quebec referendum, he headed the &quot;No&quot; federalist campaign, in opposition to the PQ&#x27;s proposals for Quebec sovereignty. With the sovereignty campaign leading in polls, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and federal Progressive Conservative leader (and former Deputy Prime Minister) Jean Charest went to the province to help the &quot;No&quot; side campaign. The &quot;No&quot; side narrowly won the referendum.

Johnson served as Liberal party leader and leader of the Opposition until 1998 when he was succeeded by Jean Charest.

==Post-political career==
Since 1998, Daniel Johnson has acted as senior counsel with the law firm McCarthy Tétrault LLP. He is also a director of exp Global Inc., Bombardier Inc., The Great-West Life Assurance Company, The Investors Group, Ecopia Biosciences inc., and is Chairman of the Board of Victhom Human Bionics in Quebec City.

On April 15, 2008, Johnson was appointed to Bank of Canada&#x27;s board of directors.

==Elections as party leader==
Johnson lost the 1994 provincial election.

<doc id="298704" wikidata="Q5125871" url="?curid=298704" title="Clapham Park">
<text>Clapham Park is an area in the Borough of Lambeth in London, to the south of central Clapham and west of Brixton.

==History==
The original Clapham Park Estate was a speculative development by Thomas Cubitt, who bought of Bleak Hall Farm in 1825, and marked out plots for building around the new, broad, tree-lined streets of King&#x27;s Road, Clarence Road, Queen&#x27;s Road and Atkins Road. (The first three have now been renamed Kings Avenue, Clarence Avenue and Poynders Road respectively). The estate was planned to consist of large detached houses in Cubitt&#x27;s characteristic Italianate villa style, with each house set in extensive grounds. However, Cubitt&#x27;s ambitions were never fulfilled, and some plots remained undeveloped at the outbreak of World War I. Cubitt&#x27;s own residence, Lincoln House, was demolished in 1905, and Rodenhurst Road, a street of large, double-fronted, semi-detached Edwardian houses, was laid out on the site. British statesman Arthur Henderson once lived at number 13 and there is a Blue Plaque on the house indicating this. With the adoption of Poynders Road as the arterial &quot;South Circular&quot; road, this area is now severed from the area further south by traffic, and the streets south of Poynders Road are not generally referred to as being part of Clapham Park.

=== Clapham Park West Estate===
Following World War II, Oaklands House, Oakfield House, Clarence House, and their associated grounds underwent much development as this area was heavily damaged during the Blitz. The area immediately to the east of the Estate had been developed by the London County Council (LCC) in the 1920s as council housing, mostly in characteristic blocks of neo-Georgian brick flats. After 1945, most of the Cubitt houses were demolished and the northern part of the original area was redeveloped by the LCC in a very different Modern Movement style. On completion of the scheme the Clapham Park Estate became the largest single council estate within the London Borough of Lambeth.

London Borough of Lambeth Council also built tower blocks west of Clarence Avenue, including three tower blocks (Barnsbury, Belgravia and Bloomsbury houses) commemorating Cubitt&#x27;s more successful developments.

An air raid shelter is still situated within the former grounds of Clarence House, now the Clapham Park West Estate. Some of the undeveloped plots on the southern part of the estate were developed with medium-density terraced and semi-detached houses, but the majority of the grounds associated with Oakfield House were transformed into the Poynders Garden Estate and an open green space now called Agnes Riley Gardens.

===Metropolitan Clapham Park===
Metropolitan Clapham Park is an estate, run in partnership with Metropolitan, a housing association that was formed to take over the ownership and management of houses on the Clapham Park estate following the stock transfer of the estate from the council to Metropolitan Housing in 2006.

Since May 2006, Metropolitan Clapham Park has provided a housing management and maintenance service to Clapham Park tenants who are renting their homes. Clapham Park also offers services to leaseholders, shared ownership schemes, and private residents of the estate.

Formerly known as Clapham Park Homes, the housing association was renamed Metropolitan Clapham Park in April 2012. Metropolitan Clapham Park is a limited company and is managed by a board that is responsible for the organisation. The board is made up of residents, local authority, local councillors, nominees and independent members. All board members serve in a voluntary capacity.

===New Deals for Communities===
In February 1999, the Clapham Park area was selected by a borough-wide strategic partnership to be Lambeth&#x27;s New Deal for Communities (NDC) neighbourhood. A successful bid led to the award of £56 million over a 10-year period, starting in April 2000. Clapham Park Project, a community led project team, was formed to take charge of the NDC programme and transform the lives and prospects of this deprived community.

From 2001, the Clapham Park Project worked with residents and partners to develop a Masterplan to regenerate the Clapham Park area up to. In March 2005, residents voted yes to a stock transfer from Lambeth Council to Clapham Park Homes, which was specifically set up to take over the ownership and management of homes on Clapham Park.

The regeneration programme has been funded in part by the Housing Corporation&#x27;s Social Housing grant; the NDC grant through Clapham Park Project; and through private loans, a large proportion of which will be paid back through the outright sale of homes, mixed tenures and the balance from rental income.

The programme has so far provided (or is on site to provide) a total of 489 new build properties and 512 refurbished properties.

==&quot;Abbeville Village&quot;==
From the 1880s the area to the west of Cubitt&#x27;s land holdings between Clapham Common Southside and the site of Lincoln House was also developed. This area borrowed the name of Clapham Park, presumably because of its original social cachet, and its streets have predominantly remained in owner occupation. The grid of late Victorian era streets around Abbeville Road is frequently referred to by estate agents, such as Orlando Reid, Jacksons estate agents, as &quot;Abbeville Village&quot;, although many of the independent local shops that gave the area a distinct character until the 1990s have made way for restaurants, cafes and bars, as the street has become the centre of local night life for the professional middle classes, and shop rentals have increased considerably.

==Agnes Riley Memorial Gardens==
Frederick George Riley gifted Oakfield House and its grounds to London County Council, on the proviso that it made the site into a public open space with the name &#x27;Agnes Riley Memorial Gardens&#x27;. Riley gifted two acres in 1937 and work began immediately to develop these, but World War II intervened and the two acres were used for allotments and occupied by the military. Riley himself remained at Oakfield until his death in 1942. However, in 1952, and against his wishes, Lambeth Council decided to drop the word ‘memorial’ from the name of the small park, which was completed in 1954. The southern part of the park is devoted to a children&#x27;s playground, paddling pool, and hard games area; the rest is laid out with trees, shrubs, lawns, and an ornamental pond. A park lodge was built but this fell into disrepair and was demolished in 2002.

Since 2005, the Friends of Agnes Riley Gardens (FoARGS) had worked with Lambeth Council to convert the site of the lodge into a community garden. Although the pond is much reduced in size compared to 1938, it and the community garden together form a much-loved local amenity, and residents in the neighbourhood wanted to see it restored to its original state for the benefit of the public. In December 2008, Vernon De Maynard, (Chair – Clapham Park West Residents Association (CPWRA)) contacted Lambeth Parks to find out why the pond and community garden had been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair. He was told that funding issues and other priorities had resulted in these local amenities not being maintained to a satisfactory standard and that he should contact the FoARGS to find out what was happening with the community garden. It transpired that the FoARGS had been working on it since 2005, but due to financial constraints, and other priorities, the community garden had fallen into a state of disrepair. So, in March 2009, Vernon De Maynard discussed the issue with CPWRA and Poynders Garden TRA, and applied to the London Community Foundation for a grant to restore the community garden. In June 2009, a grant was awarded, and this was used to restore the garden.

<text>Batman is an American live-action television series based on the DC Comics character of the same name. It stars Adam West as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Burt Ward as Dick Grayson/Robin—two crime-fighting heroes who defend Gotham City from a variety of archvillains. It is known for its camp style and upbeat theme music, as well as its intentionally humorous, simplistic morality aimed at its preteen audience. The 120 episodes aired on the ABC network for three seasons from January 12, 1966, to March 14, 1968, twice weekly during the first two seasons, and weekly for the third. In 2016, television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz ranked &quot;Batman&quot; as the 82nd greatest American television series of all time. A companion feature film was released in 1966 between the first and second seasons of the TV show.

&quot;Batman&quot; held the record for the longest-running live-action superhero television series (in terms of episodes) until it was surpassed by &quot;Smallville&quot; in 2007.

==Overview==
The series focuses on Batman and Robin as they defend Gotham City from its various criminals. Although the lives of their alter-egos, millionaire Bruce Wayne and his ward Dick Grayson are frequently shown, it is usually only briefly, in the context of their being called away on superhero business or in circumstances where they need to employ their public identities to assist in their crime-fighting. The &quot;Dynamic Duo&quot; typically comes to the aid of the Gotham City Police Department upon the latter being stumped by a supervillain, who is usually accompanied in their appearances by several henchmen and, in the case of male villains, an attractive female companion. Throughout each episode, Batman and Robin follow a series of seemingly improbable clues (also known as &quot;bat logic&quot;) to discover the supervillain&#x27;s plan, then figure out how to thwart that plan and capture the criminal.

For the first two seasons, &quot;Batman&quot; aired twice a week on consecutive nights. Every story is a two-parter, except for two three-parters featuring villainous team-ups (the Joker and the Penguin, then the Penguin and Marsha, Queen of Diamonds) in the second season. The titles of each multi-part story usually rhyme. The third and final season, which aired one episode a week and introduced Yvonne Craig as Barbara Gordon/Batgirl, consists of self-contained stories. Each third-season story ends with a teaser featuring the next episode&#x27;s guest villain, except for the series finale. The cliffhangers between multiple-part stories consist of villains holding someone captive, usually Batman and/or Robin, with the captive(s) being threatened by death, serious injury, or another fate. These cliffhangers are resolved early in follow-up episodes, with captives escaping the traps.

Ostensibly a crime series, the show&#x27;s style is intentionally campy and tongue-in-cheek. It exaggerates situations and plays them for laughs, while the characters take the absurd situations very seriously.

==Cast and characters==
===Regular cast===
* Adam West as Bruce Wayne / Batman: A multi-millionaire industrialist whose parents were murdered when he was a child and who now secretly uses his vast fortune to fight crime as the superhero Batman. Producer William Dozier cast Adam West in the role after seeing him perform as the James Bond-like spy Captain Q in a Nestlé Quik television commercial. Lyle Waggoner had screen-tested for the role, though West ultimately won out because, it was said, he was the only person who could deliver his lines with a straight face. West later voiced an animated version of the title character on &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot; while Waggoner would appear in a later superhero TV series of his own, as Steve Trevor in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;.
* Burt Ward as Dick Grayson / Robin: Batman&#x27;s sidekick, dubbed the &quot;Boy Wonder,&quot; is a high school student noted for his recurring interjections in the form of &quot;Holy ________, Batman!&quot; The series avoids referencing Robin&#x27;s origins as Bruce Wayne&#x27;s fellow &quot;crime orphan&quot; and Wayne&#x27;s appointment as Dick Grayson&#x27;s legal guardian. Ward later voiced this character on the 1977 animated TV series &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot;.
* Alan Napier as Alfred: Batman&#x27;s loyal butler and Batgirl&#x27;s discreet confidant. He is the only person who knows the true identities of Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and Barbara Gordon.
* Neil Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon: The Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department and one of Batman&#x27;s two primary police contacts. He summons the Dynamic Duo via the Batphone or the Bat Signal.
* Stafford Repp as Chief O&#x27;Hara: Gotham City&#x27;s Chief of Police and Batman&#x27;s other primary police contact. The character was created by Semple for the series as someone for Gordon to talk to and later briefly added to the comics. In 2013, DC revealed this incarnation&#x27;s first name as &quot;Miles&quot; in their &quot;Batman&#x27; 66&quot; comics.
* Madge Blake as Harriet Cooper: Dick Grayson&#x27;s maternal aunt. She first appeared in the comics two years before the series premiered to give Bruce and Dick a reason to be secretive about their dual identities.
* Yvonne Craig as Barbara Gordon / Batgirl: Commissioner Gordon&#x27;s daughter, Gotham City librarian, and crime-fighting partner for Batman and Robin in the third season. Occasionally, this threesome was nicknamed the &quot;Terrific Trio&quot;.
* William Dozier as Narrator (uncredited).

According to Adam West&#x27;s memoir &quot;Back to the Batcave&quot;, his first exposure to the series concept was through reading a sample script in which Batman enters a nightclub in his complete costume and requests a booth near the wall, as he &quot;shouldn&#x27;t wish to attract attention&quot;. The scrupulously formal dialogue and the way that Batman earnestly believed he could avoid standing out while wearing a skintight blue-and-grey costume convinced West of the character&#x27;s comic potential.

===Recurring villains===

* Cesar Romero as The Joker:A clown-themed, prank-loving villain and Batman&#x27;s arch-enemy who leaves behind jokes as clues to his crimes.
* Burgess Meredith as The Penguin: A penguin-themed gentleman thief who commits crimes using multipurpose umbrellas.
* Frank Gorshin (Seasons 1 and 3) and John Astin (Season 2) as The Riddler:A criminal who leaves behind riddles as clues to his crimes.
* Julie Newmar (Seasons 1–2) and Eartha Kitt (Season 3) as The Catwoman:A cat-themed jewel thief and cat burglar in a complicated love-hate relationship with Batman.
* Victor Buono as Professor William McElroy / King Tut:An Egyptologist who developed a split personality after being struck on the head during a student protest. Each time he is hit on the head, he switches between the personalities of a university professor and a reincarnated version of the pharaoh Tutankhamun.
* George Sanders (Season 1), Otto Preminger and Eli Wallach (Season 2) as Dr. Art Schivel / Mr. Freeze:A mad scientist who now needs sub-zero temperatures to survive after exposure to a freeze solution. His weapon of choice is a freeze-blast gun, capable of freezing its target solid. In his first appearance, the gun can also produce a heat/incendiary beam.
* David Wayne as Jervis Tetch / The Mad Hatter: A formally dressed villain with an obsession for collecting hats (he steals the hats from his victims, then knocks them out with a mesmerizing ray that pops out of the top of his hat).
* Vincent Price as Egghead:A smug, bald genius whose crimes and speech patterns involve eggs.
* Carolyn Jones as Marsha, Queen of Diamonds:A criminal with a fondness for jewelry.
* Cliff Robertson as Shame: A Western-themed villain whose partners at various times include Okie Annie and Calamity Jan. The three of them spoof famous Western characters from the movies (namely Shane, Annie Oakley, and Calamity Jane).
* Anne Baxter as Olga, Queen of the Cossacks:A Russian villainess often paired with Egghead. Before this role, Baxter appears in one story as &quot;Zelda the Great&quot;, a magician criminal.
* Milton Berle as Louie the Lilac:A gangster with a fondness for flowers.

Producers did develop several tentative scripts for Two-Face but never produced any of them. Clint Eastwood was allegedly considered for the role shortly before the series was canceled.

==Episodes==

==Production==

===Origin===
In the early 1960s, Ed Graham Productions optioned the television rights to the comic book &quot;Batman&quot; and planned a straightforward juvenile adventure show much like &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; and &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, to air on CBS on Saturday mornings.

East Coast ABC executive Yale Udoff, a Batman fan in his childhood, contacted ABC executives Harve Bennett and Edgar J. Scherick, who were already considering developing a television series based on a comic-strip action hero, to suggest a prime-time &quot;Batman&quot; series in the hip and fun style of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;

As well, in 1964, film buff Hugh Hefner screened all 15 chapters of the 1943 &quot;Batman&quot; serial at the Playboy Mansion. The trendy event received much notice in the press, prompting Columbia to offer the unedited serial to theaters in 1965 as &quot;An Evening with Batman and Robin&quot; in one long, marathon showing. This re-release was successful enough to inspire the development of a television series based on the property. When negotiations between CBS and Graham stalled, DC Comics quickly reobtained rights and made a deal with ABC, which farmed the rights out to 20th Century Fox to produce the series.

In turn, 20th Century Fox handed the project to William Dozier and his production company, Greenway Productions. ABC and Fox expected a hip, fun, yet serious adventure show. However, Dozier, who had never before read comic books, concluded, after reading several Batman comics for research, that the only way to make the show work was to do it as a pop-art campy comedy. Originally, espionage novelist Eric Ambler was to have scripted a TV movie that would launch the television series. However, he dropped out after learning of Dozier&#x27;s campy comedy approach. Eventually, two sets of screen tests were filmed, one with Adam West and Burt Ward and the other with Lyle Waggoner and Peter Deyell, with West and Ward winning the roles.

===Season 1===
Lorenzo Semple Jr. had signed on as head scriptwriter. He wrote the pilot script and generally wrote in a pop-art adventure style. Stanley Ralph Ross, Stanford Sherman, and Charles Hoffman were script writers who generally leaned more toward campy comedy, and in Ross&#x27;s case, sometimes outright slapstick and satire. It was initially intended as a one-hour show, but ABC changed the premiere date from Fall 1966 to January. With the network having only two early-evening half-hour time slots available, the show was split into two parts to air in 30-minute installments on Wednesdays and Thursdays. A cliffhanger connected the two episodes, echoing the old movie serials.

Some ABC affiliates were unhappy that ABC included a fourth commercial minute in every episode of &quot;Batman&quot;. One affiliate refused to air the series. The network insisted it needed the extra advertising revenue.

The Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, and the Mad Hatter, villains who originated in the comic books, all appeared in the series, the plots of which were deliberately villain-driven. According to the producers, Frank Gorshin was selected to portray Riddler because he had been a Batman fan since childhood. Catwoman was portrayed by three different actresses during the series run: by Julie Newmar in the first two seasons, by Lee Meriwether in the feature film based on the series, and by Eartha Kitt in the third and final season.

The show was extraordinarily popular, and was considered &quot;the biggest TV phenomenon of the mid-1960s&quot;.

===Season 2===
Semple&#x27;s participation in the series decreased in the second season. In his autobiography &quot;Back to the Batcave&quot;, Adam West explained to Jeff Rovin – to whom he dictated the autobiography after rejecting an offer to contribute to &quot;The Official &quot;Batman&quot; Batbook&quot; written by Joel Eisner – that when work on the second season commenced following the completion of the feature film, Dozier, his immediate deputy Howie Horwitz, and the rest of the cast and crew rushed their preparation. Thus, they failed to give themselves enough time to determine what they wanted to do with the series during season two.

John Astin replaced Frank Gorshin as The Riddler for a pair of episodes when Gorshin&#x27;s new agents at William Morris demanded more money.

===Season 3===
By season three, ratings were falling, and the series&#x27; future seemed uncertain. To attract new viewers, Dozier opted to introduce a female character. He came up with the idea of using Batgirl, who in her civilian identity would be Commissioner Gordon&#x27;s daughter, Barbara. He asked the editor of the Batman comics to develop further the character (who had made her debut in a 1966 issue of &quot;Detective Comics&quot;). To convince ABC executives to introduce Batgirl as a regular on the show, a promotional short featuring Yvonne Craig as Batgirl and Tim Herbert as Killer Moth was produced. Batgirl was the first Superheroine to appear in an ongoing capacity on television. The show was reduced to once a week, with primarily self-contained episodes, although the following week&#x27;s villain would be introduced in a tag at the end of each episode, similar to a soap opera. Accordingly, the narrator&#x27;s cliffhanger phrases were mainly eliminated, and most episodes ended with him encouraging viewers to watch the following week.

Aunt Harriet was reduced to just two cameo appearances during the third season due to Madge Blake&#x27;s poor health and the issue of trying to fit so many characters (Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Chief O&#x27;Hara, and a guest villain) into a half-hour episode. Another cast change during the final season was replacing Julie Newmar, a popular recurring guest villain as the Catwoman during the first two seasons. Singer-actress Eartha Kitt assumed the role for season three, as Newmar was working on the film &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; at that time and was therefore unable to appear. In the United States, Kitt&#x27;s performance in the series marked the second mainstream television success of a black female, following Nichelle Nichols as Lt. Uhura in &quot;Star Trek&quot; and continued breaking the racial boundaries of the time. Frank Gorshin, the original actor to play the Riddler, returned after a one-season hiatus, during which John Astin made one appearance in the role.

The nature of the scripts and acting started to enter into the realm of surrealism. In addition, the third season was much more topical, with references to hippies, mods, and distinctive 1960s slang, which the previous two seasons had avoided. The set design also changed to a more minimalist setup, except for Wayne Manor, Commissioner Gordon&#x27;s office and Barbara Gorden/Batgirl&#x27;s Apartment, the majority of the season 3 sets consisted of stylized cardboard or paper cutouts set up against a black background.

===Episode format===
As head scriptwriter, Lorenzo Semple wrote four episodes himself and established a series of &quot;Bat Rules&quot; for the freelance writers working under him. The show&#x27;s campiness was played up in elements, including the design of the villains, dialogue and in signs appearing on various props. Batman would frequently reveal one of his many crime-fighting gadgets, which were usually given a ridiculous-sounding name, such as Shark Repellant Bat-Spray or Extra-Strong Bat-Knockout Gas. The series used a narrator (executive producer William Dozier, uncredited) who would end the cliffhanger episodes by intoning, &quot;Tune in tomorrow – same Bat-time, same Bat-channel!&quot; During the climactic fistfights in each episode, the punches and other impacts were punctuated by onomatopoeia (sound effects such as &quot;POW!&quot;, &quot;BAM!&quot;, &quot;ZONK!&quot;) superimposed on the screen, as in comic-book fight scenes.

A typical story begins with a villain&#x27;s nefarious caper (stealing a fabulous treasure, kidnapping a prominent person, attempting to take over Gotham City, etc.). At police headquarters, Commissioner Gordon and Chief O&#x27;Hara deduce the villain&#x27;s identity, admit they&#x27;re outclassed, and gaze reverently at the Batphone. At &quot;stately Wayne Manor&quot;, Alfred (Wayne&#x27;s butler) answers the Batphone and calls Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson away from an oblivious Aunt Harriet with a humorously transparent excuse. Batman and Robin race the Batmobile to police headquarters and begin to work on the case, usually insisting on doing it alone. Batman and Robin locate the villain, lose in a brawl, and are left alone in a ridiculously complex deathtrap. The episode ends in a cliffhanger. The next episode resolves the cliffhanger in a comically improbable fashion. The same general plot pattern of investigation and confrontation repeats until another major brawl (accented by onscreen onomatopoeic words) that defeats the villain. Scene transitions in the show were accompanied by a Batman logo appearing over a rapidly-spinning background along with an iconic stinger. Episodes also frequently featured &quot;Window Cameos&quot;, in which Batman and Robin are shown climbing up the side of a building by rope, and a guest celebrity appears out of a nearby window of the building and makes a joke or aside.

===Cancellation===
Near the end of the third season, ratings had dropped significantly, and ABC canceled the show. NBC agreed to take over the series, but before it could do so, it was discovered that hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of &quot;Batman&quot; sets had been destroyed. Rather than rebuild the sets, NBC dropped the project.

===Camera shots===
From the beginning, cameras were purposely placed out of level with the set (known as &quot;Dutch tilt&quot;), and characters were filmed from high and low angles. This technique was most often used when filming on the set of a villain&#x27;s lair to lend a surreal, comic-book quality to the scenes, as well as to imply or merely remind the viewer that the crooks were crooked.

===Batmobile===
The original Batmobile from the 1960s TV series was auctioned in January 2013, at the Barrett-Jackson auction house in Scottsdale, Arizona. It was sold for $4.2 million.

===Tie-in music===
Several cast members recorded music tied into the series. Adam West released a single titled &quot;Miranda&quot;, a country-tinged pop song that he actually performed in costume during live appearances in the 1960s. Frank Gorshin released a song titled &quot;The Riddler&quot;, which was composed and arranged by Mel Tormé. Burgess Meredith recorded a spoken-word single called &quot;The Escape&quot; backed with &quot;The Capture&quot;, which consisted of the Penguin narrating his recent crime spree to a jazz beat. Burt Ward recorded a song called &quot;Boy Wonder, I Love You&quot;, written and arranged by Frank Zappa.

In 1966, &quot;Batman: The Exclusive Original Soundtrack Album&quot; was released on LP, featuring music by Nelson Riddle and snippets of dialogue from Adam West, Burt Ward, Burgess Meredith, Frank Gorshin, Anne Baxter (as Zelda the Great) and George Sanders (the first Mr. Freeze). The &quot;Batman Theme&quot; was included, along with titles like &quot;Batusi A Go! Go!&quot;, &quot;Batman Thaws Mr. Freeze&quot;, and &quot;Batman Blues&quot;. It was reissued later on compact disc. Neal Hefti, who wrote the iconic theme song for the series, also released a soundtrack album in 1966, &quot;Batman Theme and 11 Hefti Bat Songs&quot;.

==Release==
===Home media===
In January 2014, television host Conan O&#x27;Brien posted on his Twitter account, and Warner Bros. later confirmed that Warner Bros. would release an official DVD and Blu-ray boxed set of the complete series sometime the same year. In April, the website tvshowsondvd.com quoted Burt Ward in saying that Warner Bros. would release the complete series on November 11, 2014, in time for the holiday season under license from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment and that Adam West and he were doing special features for the release.

Prior to the announcement, multiple conflicting reports were given for the reason the series had not been released officially. These included:
* Negotiations between DC Comics (and parent company Warner Bros.), owners of the Batman character, and 20th Century Fox Television.
* Greenway/ABC/Fox rights issues: The &quot;Batman&quot; series was conceived as an equal partnership between William Dozier&#x27;s Greenway Productions and Fox in 1964 before Fox entered into a separate agreement with ABC to produce the series in 1965. With three companies involved almost from the outset, some speculation indicated these rights were tangled even before the DC Comics character ownership rights were to be considered. In 2006, Deborah Dozier Potter, &quot;the successor-in-interest to Greenway Productions&quot; sued Fox for allegedly withholding monies under the Fox/ABC agreement. Dozier Potter further claimed that this came to her attention when, in March 2005, &quot;she considered releasing the series on DVD&quot;, implying that (from her perspective at least) Greenway/Dozier Potter had some say in the matter of potential DVD release of the series. The case was resolved/dismissed in November 2007. In February 2005, John Stacks approached Deborah Dozier Potter to market the series on DVD. There were many offers and lots of interest in the release of the series, as can be read in Joel Eisner&#x27;s &quot;The Official Batbook Revised Bat Edition 2008&quot;. Soon after, Classic Media bought out the Dozier estate&#x27;s interest in the series, which they then sold to Fox in the early years of the 2010s.
* Other complications/rights issues:
** Christopher D. Heer, writing at the &quot;1966 Batman Message Board&quot;, clarified a quote by moderator Lee Kirkham, noting that there may have been the need for complicated deals regarding the numerous cameos, since &quot;...at least some of the cameos were done as uncredited, unpaid walk-ons – which means that Fox does NOT have home video clearances for them. Either those scenes would have to be cut or an agreement reached with the actors&quot;.
** Kirkham&#x27;s initial quote also noted that, alongside music clearance issues, there could also have been problems over some of the costumes and the original Batmobile:
::&quot;It may surprise you, but then there are also rights issues concerning the design of the unique Batmobile design used in the show, and possibly a separate issue regarding some of the costumes as well!&quot;

Under the Fox/ABC deal, the series is still in syndication and regularly shown on several channels worldwide, currently appearing in the United States on Me-TV and IFC as of July 2014. Until 2014, only the 1966 feature film was available on DVD from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment for nonbroadcast viewing in North America. This affected the 2003 television movie reunion &quot;Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt&quot;, also released to DVD, could only use footage from the 1966 movie.

With &quot;Batman&quot; being unavailable for home video release until 2014, an unusual situation occurred in which material considered to be DVD featurettes was released separately. In 2004, Image Entertainment released &quot;Holy Batmania&quot;, a two-DVD set that included documentaries on the making of the series, as well as rare footage such as the original screen tests of the cast and Lyle Waggoner. In 2008, Adam West released a privately issued DVD with the tongue-in-cheek title &quot;Adam West Naked&quot; for which he recorded anecdotes regarding all 120 episodes of the series. In 2013, PBS aired an episode of &quot;Pioneers of Television&quot; called &quot;Superheroes&quot; that featured interviews with Adam West and Burt Ward, and talked about the 1960s TV series. It was released on DVD on March 11 of the same year.

Also in 2013, PBS produced and transmitted a documentary titled &quot;Superheroes: A Never-Ending Battle&quot;. This documentary talked a little bit about the series and included an interview with Adam West.

Warner Bros. released the full 120-episode &quot;Batman&quot; collection on Blu-ray and DVD on November 11, 2014 (under license from 20th Century Fox) with a variety of extras including a miniature Batmobile, a 32-page episode guide, and a 32-page hardcover book titled &quot;The&quot; &quot;Adam West Scrapbook&quot;. A second box set released on Warner Bros.&#x27; own &quot;batmanondvd&quot; website replaces the Batmobile, &quot;The Adam West Scrapbook&quot;, and the trading cards with a letter from Adam West, a script from the episode &quot;The Joker is Wild&quot; and a bonus box containing the film on DVD and the &quot;Adam West Naked&quot; documentary. This series is also available at the Google Play Store, and iTunes Store.

==Reception==
On review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the series as a whole has received an approval rating of 72%. Additionally, the first season received an approval rating of 50%, based on twenty-two reviews, its consensus reads: &quot;Holy mixed reception, Batman! - this deadpan farce translates the beloved comic strip with the punch of an onomatopoeia panel, but its overload of camp can be as grating as it is amusing&quot;. While the third season received an approval rating of 94%, based on sixteen reviews, its consensus reads: &quot;Fierce females shook up the dynamic duo in the final season of Batman with plenty of technicolor &quot;POW!&quot;&quot;

Television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz ranked &quot;Batman&quot; as the 82nd greatest American television show of all time in their 2016 book titled &quot;TV (The Book)&quot;, stating that &quot;West&#x27;s performance, the brilliance of which has required decades to be properly recognized, played as if series creator William Dozier and chief developer Lorenzo Semple Jr., had taken the establishment&#x27;s fantasy of itself and dolled it up in tights and a cape. The anarchic gangs of supervillains and henchmen that kept trying to capture or destroy Gotham City stood in for the forces of chaos that kept threatening to engulf so-called civilized America throughout the sixties, only made colorfully grotesque and knowingly silly&quot;. In 1997, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the episodes &quot;The Purr-fect Crime&quot; and &quot;Better Luck Next Time&quot; #86 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes. In 2009, &quot;Better Luck Next Time&quot; was ranked No. 72.

In the opening scene, West and Ward are in the Batmobile from an actual TV episode. They are segued from the TV film episode to the live stage again inside the Batmobile. Ricardo Montalbán introduces them. Ward requests that he would like to have a 15th-anniversary reunion of the Batman Class of 1968.
* On April 28, 1988, &quot;The Late Show&quot;, hosted by Ross Shafer, had a &quot;Batman&quot; reunion show with the following cast members. Adam West, Burt Ward, Julie Newmar, Eartha Kitt, Frank Gorshin, Yvonne Craig, a pre-recorded video appearance by Cesar Romero, and the last television appearance of Alan Napier, who plays Alfred Pennyworth. Batmobile creator George Barris also appeared with the stunt version of the Batmobile. Eartha Kitt performed her song &quot;I Want to Be Evil&quot;.
* In 1997, West returned to the role of Batman for the first time in 12 years, voicing the Caped Crusader/Spruce Wayne in the animated short &quot;Boo Wonder&quot;. It was the fourth segment of episode 93 (season 5) of &quot;Animaniacs&quot; produced by Warner Bros. It was a parody of the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; TV series with &quot;Animaniacs&quot; character Chicken Boo replacing Robin the Boy Wonder.
* In 2002, West and Ward did their voice-over and reprised their roles as Batman and Robin in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Large Marge&quot;. Bart Simpson with his friend, Milhouse Van Houten, watched an old &quot;Batman&quot; episode as the dynamic duo were trapped on a carousel by Krusty the Clown as ClownFace. Batman and Robin made their escapes, thanks to their Bat Carousel Reversal Spray. The police arrested ClownFace and his henchmen.
* In 2003, West and Ward reunited for a tongue-in-cheek television movie titled &quot;Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt&quot; which combined dramatized recreations of the filming of the original series (with younger actors standing in for the stars), with modern footage of West and Ward searching for a stolen Batmobile. The film included cameo appearances by Newmar, Gorshin, and Lee Meriwether, as well as Lyle Waggoner, who had been an early candidate for the role of Batman. Yvonne Craig did not appear in the film as she reportedly disliked the script. The film was released on DVD in May 2005.
* In 2005, West again returned to the role of Batman/Bruce Wayne for the Digital Animation &amp; Visual Effects (DAVE) School released &quot;Batman: New Times&quot;, a short CGI film in which all characters were portrayed as Minimates (predating the Lego film craze). In addition to West, other notable voice actors included Mark Hamill as The Joker, Courtney Thorne-Smith as Catwoman, and Dick Van Dyke as Commissioner Gordon.
* Ward reprised his role as Dick Grayson / Robin in the 2019 Arrowverse crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

==Spin-offs and sequels==
===&quot;Batman&quot; (1966 film)===

A film based on the television show, &quot;Batman&quot;, was released in 1966. The film was initially intended to be produced before the series as a way to introduce the series to the public, but the series premiere was moved up, and the film was forced to wait until the summer hiatus after the first season. The film was produced quickly to get into theatres prior to the start of season two of the television series.

The film did not initially perform well in theaters. Originally, the film had been conceived to help sell the television series abroad, but the success of the series in the United States was sufficient publicity. The film was shot after season one was filmed. The film&#x27;s budget allowed for producers to build the Batboat and lease a helicopter that would be made into the Batcopter, both of which were used in the second and third seasons of the television show.

In addition to the film, and prior to season 3, a 7-minute pilot introducing Batgirl was produced. While it never actually aired, it was intended as a pilot for a Batgirl spin-off series that would often cross over with the parent series. These actions were to boost declining ratings and to get a wider audience by having a regular female lead. Eventually the end result was simply adding Batgirl as one of the leads on the main series and she appeared in every episode of the 3rd season with the seasons opening episode focusing almost entirely on her. This helped the season&#x27;s ratings temporarily increase, but not enough for ABC to continue to produce new episodes. 
===&quot;Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders&quot;===

West and Ward reprised their roles in &quot;Batman&quot; animated film as their characters for the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary along with Julie Newmar returning.

&quot;&quot; was released on Digital HD and Digital Media on October 11, 2016, and on DVD and Blu-ray November 1.

===&quot;Batman vs. Two-Face&quot;===

A sequel to &quot;Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders&quot; called &quot;Batman vs. Two-Face&quot; was released on October 10, 2017. The film starred William Shatner voicing Two-Face as the main antagonist. Adam West died before it was released, but did complete his voiceover work before his death. This was one of Adam West&#x27;s final performances before he died from leukemia.

===&quot;Batman &#x27;66&quot;===

In 2013, DC began publication of &quot;Batman &#x27;66&quot;, a comic book series telling all-new stories set in the world of the 1966–68 TV series. Jeff Parker writes the series, which features cover art by Mike Allred and interior art by different artists in each issue. In the course of this series, the Bookworm, the Minstrel, Sandman, Olga Queen of the Cossacks, Zelda The Great, Shame, and Marsha Queen of Diamonds all have their first appearance in Batman comics. Penguin, Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, and Mr. Freeze also appear in the series. Issue #3 of &quot;Batman &#x27;66&quot; introduced the Red Hood and Dr. Holly Quinn into the series continuity. In issue #7, Batman used a new vehicle, the Bat-Jet, to follow False-Face to Mount Rushmore. The series was to have introduced Killer Croc into the continuity, as well as a new villainess named Cleopatra. Issues #23 through #28 were mainly dedicated to introducing villains from the comics that either were not used, such as Solomon Grundy, Poison Ivy, and Scarecrow, or did not exist at the time, such as Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, Bane, the Harlequin (Dr. Quinn&#x27;s criminal persona) and Killer Croc (who was introduced earlier as one of King Tut&#x27;s henchmen but gained a focus story). The first five issues were compiled into the &quot;Batman &#x27;66 Vol. 1&quot; trade paperback in April 2014. Kevin Smith and Ralph Garman likewise worked on a Batman and Green Hornet crossover titled &quot;Batman &#x27;66 meets The Green Hornet&quot;. The six-issue miniseries began publication in June 2014. Jeff Parker wrote a Batman and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; team-up titled &quot;Batman &#x27;66 meets The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; released in 2016. Ian Edginton wrote a Batman team-up with John Steed and Emma Peel of &quot;The Avengers&quot; titled &quot;Batman &#x27;66 Meets Steed and Mrs. Peel&quot;. Batman teams up with Wonder Woman in the crossover team up &quot;Batman&#x27; 66 Meets Wonder Woman &#x27;77&quot;, written by both Parker and Marc Andreyko. In a reversal of sorts, Archie Comics produced the next crossover titled, &quot;Archie Meets Batman &#x27;66&quot;, released as a six issue mini series in July 2018. The series was written by Batman &#x27;66 veteran Jeff Parker and Archies stalwart Michael Moreci. Mike Allred returned to create the main covers, with Archie artists creating the alternative covers and interior art.

====Other comics====
A version of Batman closely resembling his 1960s TV series counterpart briefly appears in the 2003 &quot;Planetary/Batman&quot; one-shot by DC Comics.

The 7th issue of &quot;Solo&quot; featured a short adventure titled &quot;Batman A-Go-Go!&quot;, which was created by writer/artist Mike Allred as a tribute to the 1960s TV series.

Bluewater Comics has released a series of comics that take their cue from the TV show. They are &quot;The Mis-Adventures of Adam West&quot;, &quot;The Secret Lives of Julie Newmar&quot;, and &quot;Burt Ward, Boy Wonder&quot; and are similar in tone to the TV series. &quot;The Mis-Adventures of Adam West&quot; is a four-issue miniseries and a regular series that ran nine issues. &quot;The Secret Lives of Julie Newmar&quot; is a four-issue miniseries, and &quot;Burt Ward, Boy Wonder&quot; was going to be a four-issue miniseries but has not yet been published in full (although a promotional first issue was released for Free Comic Book Day).

==Crossovers==
===&quot;The Green Hornet&quot;===

Van Williams and Bruce Lee made a cameo appearance as the Green Hornet and Kato in &quot;window cameos&quot; while Batman and Robin were climbing a building. This was in part one of a two-part second-season episode of the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, &quot;The Spell of Tut&quot;, which aired on September 28, 1966.

Later that same season, the Green Hornet and Kato appeared in the two-part second-season episodes &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot; and &quot;Batman&#x27;s Satisfaction&quot;, aired on March 1–2, 1967. In the two episodes, the Green Hornet and Kato are in Gotham City to bust a counterfeit stamp ring run by Colonel Gumm (portrayed by Roger C. Carmel). The &quot;Batman&#x27;s Satisfaction&quot; episode leads to a mixed fight, with both Batman &amp; Robin and the Green Hornet &amp; Kato fighting Colonel Gumm and his gang. Once Gumm&#x27;s crew was defeated, Batman and Robin squared off against the Green Hornet and Kato, resulting in a stand-off that was interrupted by the police. In this episode, Batman, Robin, and the police consider the Green Hornet and Kato to be criminals. Batman and Robin however were cordial to the duo in the earlier window appearance. There is also a mention of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; TV series in the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series episode &quot;The Impractical Joker&quot; (episode 55, Part 1, aired November 16, 1966): while watching TV together, Alfred, Dick Grayson and Bruce Wayne (who says, &quot;It&#x27;s time to watch &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;&quot;, with the hornet buzzing sound audible in the background) are interrupted by the Joker; then, after the interruption, &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; TV series theme music is heard.

In the December 9, 1966 &quot;Green Hornet&quot; episode &quot;The Secret of the Sally Bell&quot;, the Batmobile can be seen revolving on its turntable floor in the Batcave on a &quot;bad guy&#x27;s&quot; TV set. In the February 3, 1967 &quot;Green Hornet&quot; episode &quot;Ace in the Hole&quot; (which aired between the September 1966 and March 1967 &quot;Batman&quot; appearances mentioned above), Batman and Robin can be seen climbing a building on a television set. There was one other Green Hornet &amp; Kato appearance that was &quot;not&quot; on the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series nor on &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; TV series: a segment of the &quot;Milton Berle Show/The Hollywood Palace&quot; aired in the Fall of 1966 brought together The Green Hornet and Kato (Van Williams and Bruce Lee), and Batman (Adam West), in a comedy sketch with Milton Berle, in which Bruce Lee demonstrates his martial arts expertise. Burt Ward as &quot;Robin&quot; was not included in this appearance.

===Arrowverse===

The Arrowverse crossover event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; features a cameo appearance from Burt Ward as an older Dick Grayson/Robin, wearing a red sweater with a yellow and green trim while walking a dog. Upon seeing the skies turn red, the former Boy Wonder shouts, &quot;Holy crimson skies of death!&quot; The event also reveals that the events of this series are set on Earth-66, which is one of the worlds destroyed by the Anti-Monitor (LaMonica Garrett) during the Crisis.

===DC Extended Universe===

After the first screening of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film &quot;The Flash&quot; (2023) to the attendees of the Cinemacon 2023, director Andy Muschietti and producer Barbara Muschietti revealed that cameo appearances of Romero&#x27;s Joker and Meredith&#x27;s Penguin were considered for the film, but were left on the &quot;cutting floor room&quot; due to not fitting in the story. The film also features CGI cameos of West as Batman and Ward as Robin during the film&#x27;s final battle.

==In other media==
===Commercials===
* Lava Soap Grime Fighters – in this 1966 commercial, Batman and Robin had just wrapped up the latest crime when Commissioner Gordon notices Chief O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s dirty hands and asks Batman to pass the chief a bar of Lava Soap.
* Rally Car Wax – Batman and Robin demonstrate this DuPont product on the Batmobile before pursuing the Joker in a 1974 commercial.
* Fact Toothpaste – Alan Napier stars as the faithful Alfred Pennyworth as he explains how to get Batman and Robin posters through Fact Toothpaste.

===Public service announcements===
The Batman character appeared in four public service announcements:
* U.S. Savings Bonds – in 1966, West, as Batman, encouraged schoolchildren to heed then-President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s call for them to buy U.S. savings stamps, a children&#x27;s version of U.S. Savings bonds, to support the Vietnam War.
* British road safety – in 1967, a one-minute public information film (PIF) was created for the Central Office of Information in the United Kingdom. The PIF was filmed in Kennington, London and showed Batman, played by Adam West, taking a break from fighting crime to help children with their techniques of road safety.
* Safety caution – in 1966, due to multiple instances of UK children jumping from elevated locations attempting to emulate Batman, Adam West and Burt Ward recorded a short PIF to be shown prior to the airing of all episodes of &quot;Batman&quot; in the UK to explain to children that Batman could not fly. Ward exclaimed in one line, &quot;Holy broken bones!&quot; during this filming.
* U.S. Department of Labor – in a 1973 PSA for the U.S. Department of Labor Wage &amp; Hour Division narrated by William Dozier, Batman and Robin were tied to a post amid the threat of a ticking time bomb, but Batgirl (Yvonne Craig) refused to release them because she was paid less than Robin (Burt Ward), in violation of the Federal Equal Pay Law. Dick Gautier played Batman this time, because West was, at the time, trying to distance himself from the role.

===Batman Live!===
During the summer/fall of 1966, Adam West and Frank Gorshin went on a tour as Batman and the Riddler to promote the new Batman movie and the series. They were usually accompanied by several bands before the featured event that saw Batman and the Riddler exchange corny jokes as well as a song performed by West. The tour most famously stopped at Shea Stadium in New York on June 25 and City Park in New Orleans on November 26.

===Film appearances===
* The 1960s TV series versions of Batman, Robin, Joker, Catwoman, and Penguin appear in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;. They are among the Warner Bros. Serververse inhabitants that watch the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad. The show&#x27;s theme song can also be heard during runaway train scene in the first DC World sequence.

===Music===
* &quot;Batman: Exclusive Original Television Soundtrack Album&quot; is the official series soundtrack featuring the music of series composer Neal Hefti, the orchestra conducted by Nelson Riddle, in addition to the voices of Adam West, Burt Ward and several guest villains from the first season. It was released in 1966 through 20th Century Fox Records.
* &quot;Miranda&quot;, recorded by Adam West at the height of the series&#x27; popularity, is an upbeat pop song about Batman falling in love but begging not to be asked to remove his mask. The B side featured West singing the non-Batman related song &quot;You Only See Her&quot;. The album was released in 1966 through 20th Century Fox Records.
* &quot;The Capture&quot; and &quot;The Escape&quot; are a pair of jazzy singles recorded by Burgess Meredith. Both songs essentially tell one story, with side A explaining how Batman foiled the Penguin&#x27;s latest plot and side B telling of the jailbreak. The songs were released in 1966 through ABC Records.
* &quot;The Riddler&quot; is a pop song written by Mel Torme and recorded by Frank Gorshin where Batman arch-villain The Riddler sings about himself while asking Riddles. The B side features the non-Batman related single by Gorshin, &quot;Never Let Her Go&quot;. The song was released in June 1966 through A&amp;M Records.
* &quot;Boy Wonder I Love You&quot; is a pop song written by Frank Zappa and recorded by Burt Ward where Robin reads fan mail from his adoring fans. The B side features Ward singing &quot;Orange Colored Sky&quot;, which Batman co-star Adam West had previously performed on the variety television show, &quot;Hollywood Palace&quot;. The song was released in 1966 through MGM Records.
* &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; and &quot;The Story of Batman&quot; are a pair of talk tunes recorded by Adam West to promote his 1976 appearances in the UK during the 10th anniversary of the TV series. Side A features Batman and Robin using pepper to defeat &quot;The Tickler&quot;. Side B features Batman telling fans how the record can be converted into a disguise by looking through the center hole of the disc as if it was some kind of mask. These recordings marked Adam West&#x27;s return to the role of Batman (aside from public appearances) for the first time since the series ended. They were released through Target Records.

===Pinball machine===
The company Stern released the pinball machine &quot;Batman &#x27;66&quot;, based on the TV series, in December 2016. It is the first Stern game that features a full-color LCD in the backbox instead of a Dot-matrix display. There are three different versions of the pinball machine: Super Limited Edition, Limited Edition and Premium.

===Collectibles===
Starting in 1966, an enormous amount of Batman merchandise was manufactured and marketed to cash in on the TV show&#x27;s vast popularity. This includes trading cards, bubblegum cards, scale model kits of the Batmobile and Batboat, coloring books, and board games. Items from this particular era have gained substantial collector appeal with their remarkable variety, scarcity, and style.

One of the most desired collectibles involves the episodes introducing Catwoman (&quot;The Purr-fect Crime&quot;/&quot;Better Luck Next Time&quot;), which were the subject of a View-Master reel &amp; booklet set in 1966 (Sawyers Packet # B492). While the series was first run on ABC, packet cover indicia reflected the &quot;Bat Craze&quot; cultural phenomenon by referring to the booklet as a &quot;Batbooklet, Dynamically Illustrated&quot;. By the time the television series was canceled in 1968, and GAF had taken over the View-Master product, &quot;Batbooklet&quot; was removed in favor of then-standard View-Master packaging for all future releases in the decades to follow, right up to the period when the standard packet line was discontinued. The first season&#x27;s superimposed fight onomatopoeias were not used for the View-Master&#x27;s scenes of fights. Instead, black-lined &quot;blast&quot; balloons (transparent inside) and series-like onomatopoeias were illustrated and superimposed over fight images.

The TV series&#x27; popularity has continued several decades after its debut; toy company Mattel has made the 1966 Batmobile in various scales for the Hot Wheels product line. The Batmobile with Batboat was also produced under the Matchbox and Corgi names in the UK during this period.

Warner Bros. acquired merchandising rights to the series in 2012. In 2013, Mattel released an action figure line based on the television series. To date, only a single series of figures have been produced: Batman, the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Catwoman, and, exclusive to a boxset, Robin. Three Batman variants were also produced: a limited SDCC exclusive boxed figure with an action feature that replicates the famous Batusi dance, a carded &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; Batman figure complete with surfboard and trunks, and a boxed, unmasked Batman with Batcomputer and Bruce Wayne&#x27;s study accessories. A carded Joker variant, with surfboard and trunks, and a boxed Batgirl figure followed. Each figure has the likeness of their respective actor (with Catwoman resembling Newmar and the Riddler resembling Gorshin) and came packaged with a display base and collector card. A Batmobile was also sold to retail, making this the first time the classic model had been produced for action figures on a 6-inch scale.

In 2013, Hong Kong-based entertainment collectible manufacturer Hot Toys produced scale versions of West&#x27;s Batman and Ward&#x27;s Robin. An extensive range of 8-inch action figures with the TV cast&#x27;s likenesses have been released by Figures Toy Company (FTC) from 2013 to 2018 and, in 2017, a single wave of 3.75-inch figures (including King Tut, Bookworm, and two Mr. Freezes) from Funko.

In 2016, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the TV series, Lego released set 76052 Classic TV series Batcave, featuring minifigure versions of Batman, Robin, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson, and the four main villains from the film (Catwoman, The Penguin, The Riddler, and Joker). In 2021, LEGO released a set based on the 1966 TV series Batmobile, featuring minifigure versions of Batman and Joker. This set was a newer version of an SDCC exclusive. Later that same year, LEGO released a buildable cowl based on the TV series.

==Legacy==
The series stars, Adam West and Burt Ward, were typecast for decades afterward, with West especially finding himself unable to escape the reputation of a hammy, camp actor. Years after the series&#x27; impact faded, an episode of &quot;&quot; paid tribute to West with an episode titled &quot;Beware the Gray Ghost&quot;. In this episode, West provided the voice of an aging star of a superhero television series Bruce Wayne had watched as a child, from which he later found inspiration. This gave West new popularity with the next generation of fans. He also played Gotham City&#x27;s Mayor Grange in a somewhat recurring role in &quot;The Batman&quot;. In addition, West played the voice of Thomas Wayne, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s father, in the episode &quot;Chill of the Night!&quot; from the series &quot;&quot;. West would eventually embrace his past with the series. His recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself as Mayor West in the TV series &quot;Family Guy&quot; deliberately made no references to the series, at the behest of &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane.

Burt Ward reprised his role as an older Dick Grayson in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

===References in popular culture===
====In film====
=====&quot;Batman&quot; (1989 film)=====
In the 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; film, directed by Tim Burton, the Joker&#x27;s real name is given as &quot;Jack Napier&quot;, which is partly a homage to Alan Napier, who played butler Alfred Pennyworth throughout the series. Adam West had also, at one point, been considered to play Bruce Wayne&#x27;s father.

=====&quot;Batman Returns&quot; (1992)=====
Director Tim Burton confirmed the plot device of Penguin running for Mayor of Gotham City in &quot;Batman Returns&quot; was borrowed from the series episodes &quot;Hizzonner the Penguin&quot; and &quot;Dizzoner the Penguin&quot;.

Additionally, Burgess Meredith, the actor who played the Penguin in the 1960s series, was initially asked to play the Penguin&#x27;s father, Tucker, but he declined due to his health problems, which culminated with his death in 1997, and was replaced with Paul Reubens.

=====&quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995)=====
A line spoken by Robin (Chris O&#x27;Donnell) in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; is an homage to the television Robin&#x27;s catch-phrase exclamations that started &quot;Holy&quot; and sometimes ended with &quot;Batman!&quot; – for example, &quot;Holy bargain basements, Batman!&quot; (from the television series&#x27; first season) and &quot;Holy flypaper, Batman!&quot; (from the television series&#x27; second season). During the film, Robin says, &quot;Holey rusted metal, Batman!&quot; after the duo climbs onto twisted metal girders beside some water. This catchphrase also appeared for a time in &quot;Batman&quot; comic books.

=====&quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008)=====
The opening scene of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, the second installment of Christopher Nolan&#x27;s Batman film series, &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;, showcases a bank robbery by the Joker. Throughout the sequence, he wears a clown mask reminiscent of the one worn by Cesar Romero in &quot;The Joker Is Wild!&quot;, his first appearance as the Joker in the series.

=====&quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; (2017)=====
The animated spin-off of &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; starring Batman features several references to the television series. When Alfred addresses similar phases of Batman&#x27;s life (in which he references all the years a Batman live-action film was released), he mentions &quot;that weird one in 1966&quot; in which the film briefly shows a clip of Adam West&#x27;s Batman dancing in an episode. During the film&#x27;s climax, Alfred dons an identical costume to Adam West&#x27;s Batman out of nostalgia.

=====&quot;Ready Player One&quot; (2018)=====
In the &quot;Ready Player One&quot;, the Batmobile from the 1966 TV series appears along with other cars and vehicles from other films and TV series in a big race.

=====&quot;Joker&quot; (2019)=====
A young Bruce Wayne briefly appears in a sequence in the 2019 standalone &quot;Joker&quot; film, where he is seen sliding down a pole. Director Todd Phillips confirmed that was an Easter egg referencing the series.

=====&quot;The Flash&quot; (2023)=====
Adam West and Burt Ward appear in cameo appearances through CGI in &quot;The Flash&quot;.

=====&quot;Merry Little Batman&quot; (2023)=====
In the Amazon Prime 2023 Christmas special, &quot;Merry Little Batman&quot;, Damian Wayne/Lil&#x27; Batman and his father, Bruce Wayne/Batman, playfully use the original theme song tone &#x27;na-na-na-na-na&#x27; as a fist-bumping sound effect whenever they bond together.

====In television====
=====&quot;The Simpsons&quot;=====
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; has been a hotbed of &quot;Batman&quot; references throughout its run. Among the most enduring is Bart Simpson&#x27;s alter-ego, &quot;Bartman&quot;, which first appeared in &quot;Three Men and a Comic Book&quot; and later became a recurring alter-ego in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; comics.

The other significant enduring reference is Radioactive Man and his companion, &quot;Fallout Boy&quot;. Though he appeared in comic book form during some season one episodes, his first major appearance is in the episode &quot;Three Men and a Comic Book&quot;, which tells his origin story. In the season 7 episode &quot;Radioactive Man&quot;, the director of a Radioactive Man reboot tells his staff that he does not want his film to be like &quot;the campy [&#x27;70s] version&quot;, and he shows a clip parodying a &quot;Batman&quot; fight scene and Paul Lynde playing the special guest villain &quot;The Scoutmaster&quot;.

Other &quot;Simpsons&quot; references to &quot;Batman&quot; include:
* The spinning scene transitions, a feature of the 1960s series, are parodied in several episodes.
* Adam West guest stars in &quot;Mr. Plow&quot; as he attends a new car show with the Simpsons and argues with Bart over the Tim Burton films starring Michael Keaton vs. the 1960s series. He also mentions the &quot;real&quot; Catwoman which was played by three different actresses in the 1966 movie and the series.
* In &quot;The Joy of Sect&quot;, Homer sings the theme song but replaces &quot;Batman&quot; with fishing. Later, &quot;Batman&quot; is replaced with &quot;Leader&quot;.
* &quot;I Am Furious (Yellow)&quot; guest stars Stan Lee who hangs around Comic Book Guy&#x27;s store and wrecks a character&#x27;s Batmobile by sticking an action figure of the Thing into the toy.
* In &quot;Large Marge&quot;, Bart and Milhouse watch an episode of the 1960s TV series where Krusty the Clown is a guest villain called ClownFace. Adam West returned to reprise his role as Batman, and Burt Ward returned to reprise his role as Robin.
* In &quot;Dark Knight Court&quot;, Mr. Burns becomes a character similar to Batman.

=====Other shows=====
* The &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; characters Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are obviously parodied of Batman and Robin from the 1966 TV series, as their TV show named &quot;The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy&quot; parodies the series. The season 7 episode &quot;Back to the Past&quot;, featured young versions of the superheroes in the past voiced by the respective actors of Batman and Robin, Adam West and Burt Ward.
* In &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, Adam West occasionally voices a fictionalized, animated version of himself in the series, and plays the television superhero Catman in a tribute to the authentic West&#x27;s role as Batman.
* In season 2, episode 11 of &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, Kim Possible&#x27;s sidekick Ron Stoppable performs volunteer work at the home of recluse Timothy North (voiced by Adam West). He accidentally discovers a button concealed in a bust, leading to the Ferret Hole of (supposed) retired crime-fighter &#x27;The Fearless Ferret&#x27;. Ron (voiced by Will Friedle) assumes North&#x27;s mission &#x27;to ferret out evil&#x27; until Ron and Kim discover that North is a gently delusional actor misremembering his time on a vintage TV show. Tributes include &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; (Friedle previously voiced Batman&#x27;s successor in &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;) and gentle satire of West&#x27;s challenges as a typecast actor and pop-culture icon.
* The animated television series &quot;&quot; is influenced by the 1960s television series. The opening credits feature Batman rope-climbing up a building, which Adam West and Burt Ward often did in the show. Several villains from the 1960s show including King Tut, Egghead, Mad Hatter, Archer, Bookworm, False Face, Black Widow, Siren, Marsha Queen of Diamonds, Louie the Lilac, Ma Parker, and Shame make cameo appearances as prisoners at Iron Heights prison in the episode &quot;Day of the Dark Knight!&quot; They are all captured by Batman and Green Arrow during a mass escape attempt. The same villains have brief cameos in &quot;Mayhem of the Music Meister!&quot;. The episode &quot;Game Over for Owlman!&quot; shows a room in the Batcave containing &quot;souvenirs&quot; of deathtraps that the Joker employed in the 1960s series, with accompanying flashbacks: the giant key from the &quot;Human Key Duplicator&quot; from &quot;The Impractical Joker&quot;, the slot machine-controlled electric chair from &quot;The Joker Goes to School&quot;, and the giant clam from &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Hard Times&quot;. The episode &quot;The Color of Revenge!&quot; begins with a flashback to the time of the 1960s television series, using attributes such as the red Batphone, the Shakespeare bust, the sliding bookcase, the Batpoles, Robin in his old television series costume, and the shot of Batman and Robin fastening their seat belts in the Batmobile. Additionally, Adam West Batman briefly appears in &quot;Night of the Batmen!&quot; as part of an army of Batmen gathered across the Multiverse.
* The &quot;Young Justice&quot; episode &quot;Schooled&quot; briefly references the show, as well, by featuring a Shakespeare bust in Bruce&#x27;s office at the Waynetech building in Metropolis. As a further homage to the series, Bruce is shown accessing an emergency Batsuit hidden in his desk by flipping a switch concealed within the bust.
* While climbing up the mass of tentacles up the tower in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Leela and the Genestalk&quot;, a parody of the Batclimb window cameos occurs where Fry and Bender encounter Adam West&#x27;s head jar on the body of a large bat and Burt Ward&#x27;s head jar on a robot body as part of Mom&#x27;s experiments.
* Adam West and Burt Ward lend their voices and likeness to the third DC Comics special on &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. In the plot, when Batman brings over a Superman from another dimension to make him jealous, Superman retaliates by bringing the Adam West Batman, who trumps the Robot Chicken Batman by addressing the glucose issue of muffins and dancing. He is later seen battling the &quot;Arkham&quot; versions of Batman&#x27;s villains and is killed by Penguin&#x27;s anthrax gas. Burt Ward kidnaps him as well as the Robot Chicken Robin and takes them to the Lazarus Pit, where he resurrects West&#x27;s Batman and makes himself younger to relive the glory days. He only kidnapped Robot Chicken Robin so he could have his outfit.
* &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; has made several references to various DC media, including some to the &quot;Batman&quot; 1966 TV series. In the episode &quot;Mo&#x27; Money Mo&#x27; Problems&quot; from Season 4, when the Titans come back to Wayne Manor, the famous William Shakespeare bust from the series has a cameo as Robin references the TV series starring Adam West.
* The series &quot;Gotham&quot; includes various references to the 1960s television series. In the earlier seasons, the Shakespeare bust often makes cameo appearances at Wayne Manor. It can sometimes be seen on the fireplace shelf. In the episode &quot;Red Hood&quot;, Bruce Wayne gives Alfred a bottle of vintage wine from the year 1966. This was the year that the original TV series premiered. One of the main plots in the third season revolves around Penguin running for Mayor of Gotham City, which came from the 1960s episodes &quot;Hizzoner the Penguin&quot;/&quot;Dizzoner the Penguin&quot; and previously also inspired the film &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. In this 1960s two-parter, the Penguin used a death trap on the Dynamic Duo that involved ice blocks suspended over a giant heater; as the ice melted, Batman and Robin were slowly lowered into a vat of acid. In the &quot;Gotham&quot; episode &quot;The Gentle Art of Making Enemies&quot;, Edward Nygma uses a more realistic version of the same death trap on Penguin. The ringtone of Edward Nygma&#x27;s cell phone in &quot;How the Riddler Got His Name&quot; is an electronic version of the scene-to-scene transition sound effect from the 1960s television series that was always played before the opening theme sequence. In &quot;The Primal Riddle&quot;, Ivy Pepper becomes Cobblepot&#x27;s partner in crime and starts calling him &quot;Pengy&quot;, which was a nickname often used for Penguin by his female accomplices in the original TV series. The iconic Batspray is also alluded to in &quot;The Fear Reaper&quot;, in which Bruce uses a flammable aerosol can and a torch to fight a group of criminals. The 1960s Batman theme song is referenced in the episode &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;. It is briefly played by Jerome Valeska and his gang after they take over a rock concert. In the fifth season, Penguin and the Riddler join forces to build a submarine in order to escape from Gotham City. This is an allusion to Penguin&#x27;s submarine from the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; film. In the series finale &quot;The Beginning...&quot;, an adult Selina Kyle breaks into a diamond museum and proceeds to cut a hole into a glass case with her clawed gloves. The opening scene of the 1960s episode &quot;The Purr-fect Crime&quot; (which marked Catwoman&#x27;s live-action debut), featured a very similar sequence, in which Catwoman&#x27;s claws also cut a hole into a museum glass case.
* In the third episode of &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, &quot;Prey for the Hunter&quot;, the famous William Shakespeare bust from the series has a cameo, but instead of bending the neck back to expose the button, it is simply turned to the left, giving it the same function—exposing a hidden passageway.
* In the &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot; episode of the British TV sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, Del Boy (played by David Jason) and Rodney (played by Nicholas Lyndhurst) disguise themselves as Batman and Robin for a fancy-dress party. Along the way to the party, their appearance prevents an attempted mugging.
* In &quot;Arrow&quot; episode &quot;Elseworlds&quot;, Kara finds a William Shakespeare bust in a box.
* In the &quot;Supergirl&quot; episode &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Burt Ward makes a cameo as an older Dick Grayson (as confirmed in the aftershow Crisis Aftermath) walking his dog on Earth-66 while wearing a shirt bearing his Robin colors. When the skies of his Earth turn red, which signifies its immediate destruction by the Anti-Monitor, Dick exclaims, &quot;Holy crimson skies of death!&quot;
* In the &quot;Titans&quot; episode &quot;Bruce Wayne&quot;, Bruce Wayne performs the &quot;Batusi&quot;, a reference to the series.

====In video games====

* In &quot;&quot;, there&#x27;s a segment where the player must cross a part of the Iceberg Lounge where a vicious shark prowls. If Batman is killed by &quot;Tiny the Shark&quot;, the game is over screen may tell the player to &quot;use the bat shark repellent&quot;, a reference to the 1966 film.
* In the &quot;&quot; video game, exclusive DLC for the PlayStation 3 includes a Batman skin based on the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series. The game also includes an Easter egg referencing Burgess Meredith&#x27;s Penguin in the form of a stranded ship named the Olivia B. Meredith.
* In &quot;&quot;, the Shakespeare bust containing a hidden button used in the TV series as the secret entrance lever to the Batcave appears as one of the game&#x27;s Easter eggs. Shakespeare busts concealing buttons can be seen and interacted with in the Clock Tower and Wayne Office areas of the game. The Batman skin is also featured as DLC exclusive to the PlayStation 4 version of the game, as well as the 1960s series Robin, Catwoman, and Batmobile skins, which are available on all platforms.

=====&quot;Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham&quot;=====

In &quot;Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham&quot;, an extra level based on the series is included, titled &quot;Same Bat-time, Same Bat-channel&quot;, along with characters including Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Joker, Catwoman, Riddler, Penguin and Alfred. Adam West serves as a playable character. The Batmobile from the show is also included as a drivable vehicle. A bonus activity is included in which the player finds and rescues Adam West within most levels. The end credits sequence remakes the Batclimb window cameos.

<doc id="298706" wikidata="Q964801" url="?curid=298706" title="Pierre Marc Johnson">
<text>Pierre Marc Johnson (born July 5, 1946) is a Canadian lawyer, physician and politician. He was the 24th premier of Quebec from October 3 to December 12, 1985, making him the province&#x27;s shortest-serving premier, and the first Baby Boomer to hold the office.

== Early background ==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, on July 5, 1946, Johnson is of French-Canadian and Irish descent and is a Roman Catholic. He received a degree in law from the Université de Montréal in 1970 and a medical degree from the Université de Sherbrooke in 1976.

He is the son of Reine Gagné and Daniel Johnson Sr., who served as Premier of Quebec from 1966 to 1968. His brother, Daniel Johnson Jr., served as Premier for nine months in 1994.

Each of the Johnsons led different political parties:

* Daniel Sr. was leader of the conservative Union Nationale party, and had an ambiguous position on the question of independence for Quebec;
* Pierre Marc joined the sovereigntist PQ in the aftermath of the 1970 October Crisis;
* Daniel Jr. backed the federalist Liberals by 1977.

==Member of the Cabinet==
In 1976, Pierre Marc Johnson successfully ran as the Parti Québécois candidate for the district of Anjou. Premier René Lévesque appointed him to the cabinet in 1977 and he was re-elected in 1981.

Johnson served as Minister of Labour from 1977 to 1980, Minister to Consumers, Cooperatives and Financial Institutions from 1980 to 1981, Minister of Social Affairs from 1981 to 1984 and Attorney General from 1984 to 1985.

== Premier of Quebec ==
In the leadership election of 1985, Johnson was chosen to succeed PQ founder René Lévesque as leader of the party and consequently as Premier of Quebec.

Johnson was generally considered to be soft on the sovereignty of Quebec issue. He put independence on the back burner, as Lévesque had begun to do under the &quot;beau risque&quot; approach and eventually made that approach the official constitutional policy of his party, calling it &quot;National Affirmation&quot;.

Johnson was described as somewhat on the right of the party.

== Leader of the Official Opposition ==
He was re-elected to the legislature in 1985, but his party was defeated by the Liberals, led by Robert Bourassa.

His leadership was contested by more radical PQ supporters, such as Gérald Godin. On November 10, 1987, he resigned as head of the party, Leader of the Opposition and member of the National Assembly. He was succeeded as head of the PQ by interim leader Guy Chevrette and later Jacques Parizeau, who again made independence a primary goal.

== Elections as party leader ==
Johnson lost in the December 1985 election after becoming leader in October. Johnson became as opposition leader and stepped down as party leader in 1987 (with next election in 1989).

== Life after leaving politics ==
Both a lawyer and a physician, he is a former Professor of Law at McGill University in Montreal and was Counsel at the firm of Heenan Blaikie LLP in Montreal, Quebec until 2014. He is now Counsel at the firm of Lavery, also in Montreal. In 2001 he was appointed as chief advisor and negotiator of the Quebec government in the Softwood Lumber dispute between Canada and the United States by then Premier Bernard Landry.

In October 2006, he was chosen by the Charest government to preside over a public inquiry into the collapse of a viaduct over Autoroute 19 in Laval, Quebec, leaving five dead and six injured. The choice of Johnson was criticized by both leaders in opposition André Boisclair (PQ) and Mario Dumont (Action démocratique du Québec) because of the possibility of conflict of interest. As president, he was invested with the responsibility of investigating government administration while being a former Minister of the Quebec Government, a former Premier of Quebec, and, until shortly after this nomination, member of the board of directors of Ciment Saint-Laurent, a cement company.

Johnson was appointed by the minority Conservative government to the Canadian delegation at the United Nations&#x27; Bali Conference on climate change. 

Johnson was Quebec&#x27;s negotiator for CETA (Canada-European-union Trade Agreement).

== Attitude about sovereignty ==
Johnson refused to take a stance regarding the 1995 Quebec referendum on independence.

In December 2005 he made waves in sovereigntist circles by supporting Liberal candidate and close, longtime friend Raymond Bachand in a provincial by-election in the Outremont riding.

<doc id="298712" wikidata="Q555473" url="?curid=298712" title="Cerro Maravilla murders">
<text>The Cerro Maravilla murders, also known as the Cerro Maravilla massacre, occurred on July 25, 1978, at Cerro Maravilla, a mountain in Ponce, Puerto Rico, wherein two young Puerto Rican pro-independence activists, Carlos Enrique Soto Arriví (born December 8, 1959) and Arnaldo Darío Rosado Torres (born November 23, 1953), were murdered in a Puerto Rico Police ambush. The event sparked a series of political controversies where, in the end, the police officers were found guilty of murder and several high-ranking local government officials were accused of planning and/or covering up the incident.

Originally declared a police intervention against terrorists, the local media quickly questioned the officers&#x27; testimonies as well as the only surviving witness for inconsistencies. Carlos Romero Barceló (PNP), then Governor of Puerto Rico, ordered the local Justice Department to launch various investigations, and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Justice Department to aid in the investigations, which concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the officers&#x27; part. However, after the main local opposing political party (PPD) launched its own inquiries, new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers&#x27; part, as well as the possibility of a local and federal cover-up. Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes.

The incident and subsequent events have become one of the most controversial events in Puerto Rico&#x27;s political history, frequently called &quot;the worst political cover-up in the history of the island&quot;. The event is often used by Puerto Rican independence activists as an example of political repression against the independence movement. Joy James commented that &quot;the Cerro Maravilla massacre demonstrated the reason why colonialism was banned in the world.&quot;

==Background==

Puerto Rico was discovered by Christopher Columbus on November 19, 1493; it was first colonized by Juan Ponce de León in 1508. Despite being welcomed by the indigenous Taíno people, the Spanish settlers began to exploit the Taíno as labor for gold mining and crop growing. After failed revolts, the Taíno accepted Spanish rule as less harsh than the British Empire. Spanish colonists began to have children with the Taíno, creating a culture, while the indigenous culture disappeared due to hard labor, European diseases, and tough Spanish rule.

Spain imposed tough trade policies upon its colonies, prohibiting the trade of most goods with other countries and colonies. In the 16th century, sugarcane was found to be a profitable crop; when the Taíno failed to harvest it effectively, slaves were imported from Africa. While other crops were introduced over the next two centuries, sugar remained the most profitable. Spanish trade policies caused smugglers to begin a black market, which traded with the British, Dutch, and nearby islands.

Entrenched in war, Spain failed to enforce its trade policies, which caused Spanish ships to be targeted by the Spanish and British. When Spain allowed neutral countries to use Spanish ports, the United States used its ships to transport goods from Spain to its colonies but desired greater influence over the colonies. In 1868, a small group of Puerto Ricans staged a rebellion against Spanish rule, the , which seized the mountain town of Lares, but was quickly shut down by Spanish authorities.

In the aftermath of the Ten Years&#x27; War for Cuban independence, slavery was outlawed in Puerto Rico in 1873; in an 1896 agreement brokered by autonomist Luis Muñoz Rivera, Puerto Rico was given an autonomous local government as well as representation in the Spanish government. After the sinking of the USS &quot;Maine&quot; on February 15, 1898, the U.S. launched the Spanish–American War on May 1; the U.S. Army landed on the town of Guánica during the Puerto Rico campaign on July 25. The U.S. seized control of the island after three days, with only 26 fatalities: 17 Spanish soldiers, five American soldiers, and four civilians. Spain signed the Treaty of Paris on December 10, where it agreed to an independent Cuba, selling the Philippines to the U.S. for ( in ), and ceding Guam and Puerto Rico.

===Victims===

Carlos Enrique Soto Arriví was born on December 8, 1959, in San Juan. His parents were Pedro Juan Soto (one of the most admired Puerto Rican novelists in the 20th century) and Rosa Arriví. He had an older brother (Roberto Alfonso) and a younger brother (Juan Manuel).

As a student he enjoyed literature. He also wrote stories and went on to win second place in a competition held by the Puerto Rico Department of Education. When his parents went to Europe to finish their doctoral studies, he learned to speak French in a year. Upon returning from Europe, he enrolled at the Escuela Superior República de Colombia, a high school in Río Piedras, although in a lower grade, because the school officials did not want to credit his years of overseas study. Although Soto Arriví was interested in social issues from a very young age, his political activism started when he joined a pro-independence group in high school.

Arnaldo Darío Rosado Torres was born on November 23, 1953, in Old San Juan. His parents were Pablo Rosado and Juana Torres Aymat. Rosado finished his high school studies and went to work at a cracker factory. Dario Rosado was married to Angela Rivera, and had a son called Manuel Lenín Rosado Rivera.

From a very young age, Rosado identified with the cause of Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence. He joined the socialist league with which he participated in several activities. Rosado was an autodidact and an avid reader of various kinds of literature, especially those related to the political processes of Puerto Rico and Latin America. He also wrote poems, essays, and had several pen-pals throughout Latin America.

==Incident==

Around noon July 25, 1978, Carlos Enrique Soto Arriví and Arnaldo Darío Rosado, two independence activists of the Armed Revolutionary Movement (), along with undercover police officer Alejandro González Malavé posing as a fellow group member, took taxi driver Julio Ortiz Molina hostage in Villalba and ordered him to drive them to Cerro Maravilla where several communication towers were located. Their original plan was to take control of the towers and read a manifesto protesting the imprisonment of Puerto Rican nationalists convicted of the 1950 assassination attempt on U.S. President Harry S. Truman, the 1954 United States Capitol shooting incident where five members of Congress were injured, the commemoration of the July 25 Constitution Day observance, the day U.S. soldiers landed in Puerto Rico in 1898. State police officers were alerted of their plan prior to their arrival and the activists were ambushed and shot. The undercover agent received a minor bullet wound during the shooting, while the taxi driver was left relatively unharmed.

===Initial statements===
The morning after the shootings, the officers argued that they acted in self defense, stating that they ordered the activists to surrender, at which time the activists started shooting at them and they returned fire. Initially, the taxi driver said he was under the dashboard of his cab when the shooting started and could not see who shot first, although he contradicted his statement a few days later in an interview with the &quot;San Juan Star&quot;, a local newspaper, stating that he ducked under the dashboard of the car after the three men (the two activists and the undercover agent) left the car, and that he saw &quot;10 heavily armed men&quot; approaching. When he emerged from the car, he saw the three men alive and two of them were being beaten by the armed men, who were later identified as policemen. Then-Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló (PNP) praised the officers in a televised address by calling them “heroic”, stating that they acted in self-defense and stopped a terrorist attack.

Two days later, in a follow-up interview by WAPA-TV news reporter Enrique Cruz, the taxi driver stated that when the first shooting occurred, he heard one of his three passengers shout &quot;I&#x27;m an agent! Don&#x27;t shoot me, I&#x27;m an agent!&quot; while the others called for help and shouted &quot;I give up! I give up!&quot;. He saw &quot;10 heavily armed men&quot; approaching, later identified as police agents, when the three passengers exited the car, and the taxi driver was ordered at gunpoint to exit the vehicle. He was extracted by an agent, kicked, and taken away from the scene. While being escorted, he saw the two activists directly in front of his vehicle being beaten by the armed men.

===First investigations===

Facing public pressure due to the taxi driver&#x27;s conflicting statements, Governor Romero Barceló ordered two separate investigations by the P.R. Justice Department in addition to the ongoing standard Police investigation, all of which concluded that the officers&#x27; actions were free of any wrongdoing, despite various inconsistencies in their stories. P.R. District Attorney Pedro Colton informed reporters on July 29, four days after the incident, that the P.R. Justice Department&#x27;s investigation revealed &quot;no massacre, no beatings, and no aggressions, except for the shootings that occurred in Cerro Maravilla&quot;. Opposing political parties, mainly the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), insisted that the investigations were just cover-ups and demanded that a special independent prosecutor be assigned to investigate. Two special investigations by the U.S. Justice Department&#x27;s Civil Rights Division and by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were performed on separate occasions between 1978 and 1980, which confirmed the conclusions of the P.R. Justice Department that the officers acted in self-defense.

===Second investigations===
In the November 1980 general elections, Governor Romero Barceló was re-elected by a margin of 3,503 votes (one of the closest in Puerto Rico history), though his party lost control of the state legislature to the main opposition party, the PPD. This loss was attributed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to the surrounding controversy regarding the investigations at the time. Other news organizations, such as &quot;Time&quot;, attributed the loss to Gov. Romero Barcelo&#x27;s stance on the island&#x27;s political status. The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident. The Senate, then presided by Miguel Hernández Agosto, spearheaded the investigations by naming former Assistant District Attorney Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate.

The second investigations performed between 1981 and 1984 by the legislature, the U.S. Justice Department headed by Daniel Lopéz Romo, and the local press uncovered a plot to assassinate the activists and a possible, though not conclusive, conspiracy to cover-up these actions. During interviews of the Senate Investigations Committee in 1983, officer Miguel Cartagena Flores, a detective in the Intelligence Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department, testified: “When I arrived at the scene I saw 4 police officers aiming their guns at the two activists who were kneeling before them. I turned my eyes away and heard 5 gunshots.&quot; Cartagena, who was offered immunity for his testimony, added that several hours before the shooting, he and other officers were told by Col. Angel Perez Casillas, commander of the Intelligence Division, that “these terrorists should not come down (from the mountain) alive.” His testimony was corroborated by officer Carmelo Cruz who, although he did not witness the fatal shooting, confirmed many details provided by Cartagena when also granted immunity.

Other inquiries obtained similar testimony from witnesses, including the taxi driver who now stated that the activists were “alive and disarmed” when the police removed him from the scene. The taxi driver stated that there was a short exchange of gunfire, and when he was removed to another place nearby he heard a second volley of gunfire, but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots. The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex-officer Jesus Quiñones before a Federal grand jury (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a &quot;San Juan Star&quot; interview.

Subsequently, the legislature and local press started questioning the actions of the Puerto Rico Police, the Puerto Rico Justice Department, the U.S. Justice Department, and the FBI actions during the first investigation, alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover-up evidence. Letters were sent by various community and political leaders to then Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Edward M. Kennedy, asking for an inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations. Several letters even accused former US Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barceló during the investigations. Two leaders from the opposing parties, the Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two, the Governor, then considered as a lifelong Republican, began campaigning to deliver the 41 Democratic Party convention votes of the island for President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s (D) nomination for the presidency (ironically, Carter&#x27;s opponent for the nomination was Senator Kennedy). Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate, the U.S. Justice Department announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end. A Justice Department internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barceló&#x27;s and Civiletti&#x27;s meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially incriminate the officers, including “several unexplained contusions” on a victim&#x27;s face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story, stating that there was in fact “two bursts of firing”.

These and several other accusations brought public and political pressure to the investigating agencies. This led to internal revisions of evidence and procedures from the first investigations both at the local and federal level, though all organizations still adamantly denied any cover-up. These second investigations led to reassignments, demotions and resignations among top officials within the PR Justice Department, including three different P.R. Secretaries of Justice (equivalent to State Attorney General) accepting and resigning their posts in a span of six months. On November 29, 1983, three prosecutors were relieved of their duties after a report by the state Senate Investigations Committee found they had failed to properly investigate the Cerro Maravilla shootings, citing 101 specific deficiencies in two investigations. This was the third state Attorney General to oversee the investigations since the shootings occurred in 1978.

==Aftermath==
The second investigations led to ten officers being indicted and found guilty of perjury, destruction of evidence, and obstruction of justice, four of which were convicted of second-degree murder in 1984. The convicted officers, who were no longer on active duty, and their status with the Puerto Rico Police were:

# Col. Ángel Pérez Casillas (head of the Puerto Rico Police Department Intelligence Division during the incident; suspended)
# Lieut. Nelson González Pérez (resigned)
# Lieut. Jaime Quíles Hernández (suspended)
# Officer Juan Bruno González (suspended)
# Officer William Colón Berríos (suspended)
# Officer Nazario Mateo Espada (suspended)
# Officer Rafael Moreno Morales (suspended)
# Officer Luis Reverón Martínez (on disability leave)
# Officer Jose Ríos Polanco (suspended)
# Officer Rafael Torres Marrero (on disability leave)

That same year, in the general elections held in November, Romero Barceló lost his gubernatorial seat against former governor and opposing party rival Rafael Hernández Colón (PPD). It is widely accepted that Romero Barceló lost the elections because of this case, since his public opinion rating had deteriorated substantially during late 1984 as the investigations progressed, and since his political rivals used his defense of the officers as an indication of a possible conspiracy.

===Undercover agent murdered===
Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé, the undercover agent who was accompanying the activists, was not indicted for his part in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers, but was removed from the police force due to public pressure. In February 1986, he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver. His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and, therefore, it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping. This, despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage&#x27;s life. The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint, drove the car, and, when the car approached the mountaintop, refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists. These actions, according to officer Cruz, were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage. Nevertheless, the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer, a fact that he publicly expressed resentment over, and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated.

On the evening of April 29, 1986, just two months after his acquittal, Gonzalez was assassinated in front of his mother&#x27;s house in Bayamón. He sustained three gunshot wounds and his mother was slightly injured. A few hours later, a group identifying itself as the “Volunteer Organization for the Revolution” called local news agencies claiming responsibility. In their statements they swore to kill, &quot;one by one,&quot; all the policemen involved in the deaths in Cerro Maravilla. The FBI considered it one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations in the United States at the time, given that it was the same organization that claimed responsibility for an attack on a Navy bus in Puerto Rico on December 3, 1979, in which two Navy men were killed and 10 people injured, and the attack on a U.S. National Guard base on January 12, 1981, in which six fighter-jet planes were destroyed. To this day, no one has been identified as a possible suspect in Gonzalez&#x27;s murder, and the case remains unsolved.

===Public apologies===
In 1992, former US Justice Department Civil Rights Division chief Drew S. Days III admitted before the P.R. Senate that the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI acted negligently during the 1978–1980 investigations of the Cerro Maravilla incident, such as rejecting interviews with key witnesses (including the taxi driver), refusing to offer immunity to certain witnesses, and avoiding various standard investigating tasks. Days stated: &quot;I think that certainly an apology is justified with respect to the way the federal government handled its investigation: the FBI, the Justice Department, and my division... it was not done in the professional way that it should have been done.&quot; FBI Director William S. Sessions had made similar concessions in a written statement in 1990, stating: “In hindsight, the eyewitness should have been interviewed and a civil rights investigation initiated”.

In 2003, 25 years after the incident, former Gov. Romero Barceló admitted in a public radio interview that it was “an error of judgment” and “a premature declaration” to laud the police officers, since at that time he believed they were telling the truth about their self-defense. However, he has publicly denied any wrongdoing regarding the alleged cover-up during the first investigations.

==Legacy==
*Since the conclusion of the final investigations, there has been heated debate about the Cerro Maravilla incident in Puerto Rico, with some groups arguing that there are still others responsible for planning and/or ordering the plot to kill the activists as well as the subsequent cover-up, while others have argued that the incident was exaggerated by rival politicians and the media, maintaining that no conspiracy ever took place and that some of the officers incarcerated, though not all, are actually innocent.
*Every year on July 25, Puerto Rican Nationalists, independence activists and other sympathizers, gather atop Cerro Maravilla to honor Carlos Enrique Soto Arriví and Arnaldo Darío Rosado, as well as to defend and celebrate the Puerto Rican independence ideology. The mountain has also been christened as “El Cerro de los Mártires” (The Mountain of the Martyrs).
*In 2007 the Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña published a book by Manuel Suarez, Samuel Dash and William Kennedy titled &quot;Dos linchamientos en el Cerro Maravilla : los asesinatos policíacos en Puerto Rico y el encubrimiento del Gobierno Federal&quot; (Two lynchings on Cerro Maravilla: the police killings in Puerto Rico and the cover-up by the Federal Government).

==In popular culture==
* The film &quot;A Show of Force&quot; (1990) is loosely based on the events and theories behind the incident.
* () is a song and video by Grammy Award-winner iLe which sings about and recreates the events of that day-which she hopes will help promote and foster understanding.

<text>Carol Jane Thatcher (born 15 August 1953) is an English journalist, author and media personality. She is the daughter of Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister from 1979 to 1990, and businessman Denis Thatcher.

She has written biographies of both her parents and also produced a documentary about her father which contained his only public interview. She won the fifth series of the reality show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;

==Early life==
Thatcher was born on 15 August 1953 at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital in Hammersmith, London. She and her twin brother, Mark, were born six weeks prematurely by caesarean section. According to Margaret Thatcher, her husband Denis Thatcher responded to seeing their children for the first time by saying, &quot;My God, they look like rabbits. Put them back.&quot; Thatcher&#x27;s mother was selected for the constituency of Finchley in North London in 1958 and was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1959.

In 1960, Thatcher was sent to Queenswood School, a girls&#x27; boarding school near Hatfield, Hertfordshire, before attending St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School. She graduated with a law degree from University College London, before moving to Australia in 1977 to begin a journalism career. While she was there, her mother was elected prime minister. Thatcher later said, &quot;You need quite good shock absorbers and a sense of humour to be the prime minister&#x27;s child.&quot;

==Journalism career==

Thatcher began her career as a journalist in Australia, working on &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; from 1977 to 1979. She became a TV reporter at Channel Seven, also in Sydney, and later a reporter on its news morning show, &quot;11AM&quot;. On her return to Britain, she worked as a presenter for LBC, BBC Radio 4, TV-am and wrote travel articles for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Due to her mother&#x27;s high-profile political position, many newspapers refused to publish work with her byline.

Her first book, &quot;Diary of an Election: with Margaret Thatcher on the campaign trail&quot;, was published in 1983. Her second book, a collaboration with tennis player Chris Evert Lloyd called &quot;Lloyd on Lloyd&quot;, was released three years later. It became Thatcher&#x27;s first best-seller.

Later publications included a 1996 best-selling biography of her father, &quot;Below the Parapet&quot;. In 2003, Thatcher produced a Channel 4 documentary about him called &quot;Married to Maggie&quot;. Thatcher captured the only public interview Denis Thatcher ever gave; he died shortly after its release. Thatcher&#x27;s freelance career has included contributing articles to magazines and papers as well as television work.

==Reality shows==
===&quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;===

In November 2005 Thatcher was selected to appear with a number of fellow celebrities on the ITV television show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; The format of the show meant that she would be required to spend at least a week in the Australian rainforest with a minimal supply of food in basic living conditions.

She had to undergo one of the more infamous &quot;Bushtucker Trials&quot; during her stay in the jungle – which saw her eat jungle bugs and kangaroo testicles as a challenge to earn food for her fellow celebrities. Ultimately, she emerged as the fifth series winner and second &#x27;Queen of the Jungle&#x27;.

===&quot;Most Haunted&quot;===
Thatcher appeared on Living TV&#x27;s &quot;Most Haunted&quot; on 13 February 2007 as a celebrity guest alongside presenter Yvette Fielding 

===&quot;Mummy&#x27;s War&quot;===
In 2007, Carol Thatcher travelled to the Falkland Islands and Argentina for the documentary &quot;Mummy&#x27;s War&quot;, in order to explore the legacy of the Falklands War.

==&quot;The One Show&quot;==
From 2006 to 2009, Thatcher was a freelance contributor to the BBC One magazine programme &quot;The One Show&quot;, making filmed reports and joining the presenters and guests in the studio for discussions.

On 3 February 2009, British media reported that during the 2009 Australian Open Thatcher had, in a conversation in the show&#x27;s green room, referred to a black tennis player, reportedly Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, as a golliwog. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Thatcher called Tsonga &quot;half-golliwog&quot; and &quot;the golliwog Frog&quot;. Presenter Adrian Chiles, comedian Jo Brand, journalists and several guests were with Thatcher when she made the remark. The BBC stated that Thatcher would not work again on &quot;The One Show&quot; unless she made a more sincere apology. Thatcher refused, saying &quot;I stand by what I said. I wasn&#x27;t going to apologise. I never meant it in a racist way. It was shorthand. I described someone&#x27;s appearance colloquially—someone I happen to greatly admire.&quot;

== Bibliography ==


==Personal life==
Thatcher had a relationship with Jonathan Aitken, which ended in 1979. As this happened just after the Conservatives won the general election, Aitken&#x27;s breaking up with Thatcher is alleged to have been the reason for his being bypassed for a ministerial career; Thatcher&#x27;s mother, the Prime Minister at the time, reportedly told cabinet colleagues that she was &quot;damned&quot; if she was going to give a job to a man &quot;who had made Carol cry&quot;.

Thatcher lives with ski instructor Marco Grass in Klosters, Switzerland.

<text>Duncan Kennedy (born 1942) is an American legal scholar and held the Carter Professorship of General Jurisprudence at Harvard Law School until 2015. Now emeritus, he is best known as one of the founders of the critical legal studies movement.

==Education and early career==

Kennedy received an A.B. from Harvard College in 1964 and then worked for two years in the CIA operation that controlled the National Student Association. In 1966 he rejected his &quot;cold war liberalism&quot; and quit the CIA and in 1970 earned an LL.B. from Yale Law School. After completing a clerkship with Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, Kennedy joined the Harvard Law School faculty, becoming a full professor in 1976. In March 2010 he received an Honoris Causa (honorary degree) Ph.D. title from the University of the Andes in Colombia. In June 2011, he also received an Honoris Causa Ph.D. title from the Université du Québec à Montréal in Canada.

Kennedy has been a member of the American Civil Liberties Union since 1967.

==Academic work and influence==
In 1977, together with Karl Klare, Mark Kelman, Roberto Unger, and other scholars, Kennedy established the critical legal studies movement. Outside legal academia, he is mostly known for his monograph &quot;Legal Education and the Reproduction of Hierarchy&quot;, famous for its trenchant critique of American legal education.

<doc id="298737" wikidata="Q1131502" url="?curid=298737" title="Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional Puertorriqueña">
<text>The Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional (English: &quot;Armed Forces of National Liberation&quot;, FALN) was a Puerto Rican clandestine paramilitary organization that, through direct action, advocated independence for Puerto Rico. It carried out more than 130 bomb attacks in the United States between 1974 and 1983, including a 1975 bombing of the Fraunces Tavern in New York City that killed four people.

The FALN served as the predecessor of the Boricua Popular Army. Several of the organization&#x27;s members were arrested and convicted for seditious conspiracy, conspiracy to commit robbery and for firearms and explosives violations. On August 11, 1999 United States President Bill Clinton offered clemency to sixteen of the convicted militants under the condition that they renounce any kind of violent manifestation. This decision drew criticism towards the Clinton administration from figures including the Office of the United States Attorney, the FBI, and the United States Congress.

==Philosophy==
The group was a 1970s Marxist–Leninist militant group which fought to transform Puerto Rico into a socialist-communist form of government.

==History==
The Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional was founded in the 1960s. It was one of several organizations established during that decade that promoted &quot;clandestine armed struggles&quot; against the United States government that the movement described as the &quot;colonial forces of the United States&quot;. The group was founded following decades of persecution by the FBI, including illegal imprisonments and assassination against members of the Puerto Rican independence movement. The group was part of a movement that included other clandestine organizations, including the &quot;Movimiento Independentista Revolucionario Armado&quot;, &quot;Organización de Voluntarios por la Revolución Puertorriqueña&quot; and &quot;Los Comandos Armados de Liberación&quot;, and served as predecessor for what would become the Boricua Popular Army. The organization&#x27;s intention was to draw attention to what they described as the &quot;colonial condition&quot; of Puerto Rico through armed action against the United States government and military.

The modus operandi of the FALN was to perform bombing and incendiary actions and then admit responsibility through press releases. The first of these news releases announced the group&#x27;s intention; in this document they admitted responsibility for attacks on several locations in New York to weaken the &quot;Yanki capitalist monopoly&quot;, and demanded the release of five political prisoners, these were: Lolita Lebrón, Oscar Collazo, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andres Figueroa, and Irvin Flores. In this communique, the organization warns that they had opened two fronts, in Puerto Rico and the United States respectively, the goal of which were to organize a People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army which they expected would &quot;rid Puerto Rico of Yanki colonialism&quot;. Both fronts were supported and maintained by allies within Puerto Rico and North America.

===FALN pardons of 1999===
On August 11, 1999, U.S. President Bill Clinton offered clemency to sixteen members of the FALN convicted for seditious conspiracy, conspiracy to commit robbery, and conspiracy to bomb-making, as well as for firearms and explosives violations. None of the sixteen were convicted of bombings or any crime which injured another person, and all of the sixteen had served nineteen years or longer in prison which, according to the White House, were longer sentences than such crimes typically received. President Clinton offered the clemency at the appeal of 10 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, President Jimmy Carter, the Archbishop of New York, and the Archbishop of Puerto Rico, and it was conditional on prisoners renouncing violence. The commutation was opposed by U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office, the FBI, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and criticized by many including former victims of FALN terrorist activities, the Fraternal Order of Police, and members of Congress. Hillary Clinton in her campaign for Senator also criticized the commutation, although she had earlier been supportive. FALN prisoner Oscar López Rivera rejected the 1999 Clinton pardon. U.S. president Barack Obama later commuted his sentence, and López Rivera was released in May 2017 after 36 years in prison. He had been incarcerated longer than any other member of the FALN.

<text>Kongsberg Gruppen is a Norwegian multinational company, that supplies high-technology systems to customers in the merchant marine, defence, aerospace, offshore oil and gas industries, and renewable and utilities industries.

In 2018, Kongsberg had revenues of NOK 14.381 billion, and 6,842 employees in more than 25 countries. The company is headquartered in Kongsberg.

It comprises three business areas:
* Kongsberg Maritime 
* Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace 
* Kongsberg Digital

Kongsberg is a continuation of Kongsberg Weapons Factory (Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk - KV) (1814–1987). After KV&#x27;s restructuring in 1987 following the Toshiba–Kongsberg scandal, defence activities continued as the company Norsk Forsvarsteknologi (NFT). In 1995 the company changed its name to Kongsberg Gruppen.

Kongsberg was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in 1993 and is a public company. The Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries is the largest shareholder with a 50.001 percent interest.

Markets outside of Norway pose a growing and increasingly important part of business and represented approximately 80% of revenue in 2015.

==History==
The company&#x27;s origin and background dates back to the early 1600s.

The discovery of silver in the mountains around Kongsberg in 1624 meant that the city became an important mineral resource for the Danish Norwegian kingdom. When the Danish-Norwegian union was dissolved about 200 years later there was a need to build up a strong defence that would contribute to independence and security for Norway.

There was a need for a domestic defence industry, and Kongsberg already had expertise after centuries of mining. On 20 March 1814 Poul Steenstrup founded Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk.

===1813–1890: Origins===

1813 was an important year for Norway. The nation wrote its constitution and the weapons factory was one of the nation&#x27;s first industrial factories.

Kongsberg Silver Mines experienced a recession and as a consequence Kongsberg suffered distress and poverty. There was a need to create new jobs. In addition Norway was marked by the desire for national independence, and the Weapons factory would make the newly established state self-supplied with weapons.

Kongsberg&#x27;s mining traditions - established over several centuries - provided a good basis for building a knowledge-based business. Skilled mining engineers were now assigned to develop the new company.

The Weapons Factory quickly began producing rifles for the Norwegian Armed Forces. A number of models were developed and delivered throughout the 19th century. The major international breakthrough came in 1888 when director Ole Herman Johannes Krag and corps gunsmith Erik Jørgensen showcased a new type of rifle.

===1890–1900: International breakthrough===
International breakthrough came with the Krag–Jørgensen rifle in 1892.

The officer Ole Herman Johannes Krag and gunsmith Erik Jørgensen wanted to produce a new type of precision rifle, which was both easy to use, inexpensive to manufacture and which had revolutionary functionality. The rifle&#x27;s mechanism proved to be something quite revolutionary in the arms industry.

The Krag–Jørgensen rifle was first adopted as a service rifle by the Danish Army in 1889. Three years later the rifle became a world-known concept when the United States decided to equip their soldiers with the rifle. &quot;The Krag&quot; turned out to be one of the first major export contracts for the Norwegian industry. During a six-year period the U.S. alone produced well over half a million rifles on licence.

In 1894 the weapon was adopted as army rifle for the Norwegian Army. The weapon was in service until World War II.

&quot;The Krag&quot; became Norway&#x27;s first large-scale industrial export and helped to establish an important relationship with the U.S. military.

===1900–1945: Modernization===

The Krag–Jørgensen rifle dominated production at Kongsberg until the end of World War I. When the war was over there was a significant decline in military orders. The company therefore used its position and expertise from the defence industry to enter new markets and seek new business opportunities.

Production of civilian products such as civil weapons, tools, and parts for the shipping industry and whaling fleet began 1918. Other departments made bicycle components, while the cannon department made shafts, connecting rods, forgings and whale guns.

Kongsberg launched its first civil products in 1921. The products won gold medal at the World Exposition in Barcelona in 1929.

During World War II Kongsberg was under German control. Production, however, never came up to such numbers as the occupation forces wanted. This was partly due to access to raw materials, but also resistance among factory workers has also been suspected.

===1945–1960: Industrial locomotive===
After the war, Kongsberg was designated as one of the major industrial builders in Norway. The company produced everyday necessities such as pots and pans, and contributed to the development of the defence and maritime industry.

The weapons factory was no longer under military command, and in 1953, the Norwegian Parliament, adopted a large-scale modernization and expansion of the company. The aim was to build a national high-tech defence industry that met the needs of the Norwegian Armed Forces as well as those of NATO.

The creation of the Forsvarets Forskningsinstitutt (&quot;Defence Research Establishment&quot;) (FFI) at Kjeller in 1947 was part of the same strategy.

This cooperation was from the 1950s and up till present given rise to a number of defence systems such as the Penguin missile, NASAMS 2 air defence system, HUGIN AUV and Naval Strike Missile.

After an agreement with Volvo in 1957, the production of automobile parts also became a considerable business for KONGSBERG. At first the company produced drive shafts, and then other components for heavy trucks, buses, tractors and agricultural machinery. The division was later reorganized into the company Kongsberg Automotive.

===1960–1987: Innovative breakthrough===
Having had a national focus in the post-war period, KONGSBERG again directed its attention and expertise towards the international market. The years from 1960 to the end of the 80s were a time of innovation, development and rapid growth for Kongsberg.

KONGSBERG&#x27;s focus on the maritime industry began in the early 1970s and coincided with the discovery of oil in the North Sea. Companies that would later become part of Kongsberg Gruppen, such as Simrad and Norcontrol, however, had already provided sonar systems and equipment for fishing and merchant marine for decades.

The 1970s also became the decade when KONGSBERG positioned itself towards the petroleum sector. Dynamic positioning (DP) and subsea installations were revolutionary technology, which gave KONGSBERG a technological edge. KONGSBERG was about to get a position as a global technology leader.

===1960–1987: International breakthroughs===
* The production of gas turbines in 1969
* Submarine systems in 1969-1970
* Subsea and dynamic positioning (DP) in the early 1970s
* Pioneering missile technology and the Penguin missiles in 1972

The rapid international growth resulted in both new opportunities and challenges. The new focus on establishing a civilian product portfolio changed the shape of the company. In 1981 civil divisions accounted for 70% of business.

Companies were acquired and the number of employees increased sharply. An international network of offices and factories began to take shape. But the business advancement and progress coincided with national and international unrest, which had a serious impact on the company, as an outcome of so-called Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal, after illegal export to the Soviet Union machine tools banned by Cocom. The outcome was a need to restructure the entire company.

===1987–1993: Reappearance===
In 1987, the company was part of the Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal, which involved a subsidiary of Toshiba and the Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk. The two provided the Soviet Union with technology (Toshiba milling machines and Kongsberg computer numerical controls) that could be used to produce quiet submarine propellers, in violation of the CoCom agreement. The US always relied on the fact that the Soviets had noisy boats. Providing the Soviet Union with technology that could make their subs harder to find and track was perceived as a significant threat to the security of the United States.

1987 was a turning point in the history of Kongsberg. The company was divided into divisions that manufactured automobile parts, aircraft parts, gas turbines, oil installations, and marine equipment and defence equipment. Innovation was high, but not the profitability. The company had taken on too large and complex development tasks.

The state, which owned all the shares, would not inject big money to keep the whole business, so the company was split up. The civil division was sold out, while the defence division continued under the name Norwegian Defence Technology (NFT) from 19 June 1987 to 1995.

The newly formed company had for a short period of time a renewed focus on its core defence business. This helped the company regain financial stability. Then Kongsberg again turned its focus towards civil and maritime sectors.

Kongsberg also entered new markets. In 1990 the company launched its own aerospace division.

The restructuring process that began in 1987 culminated in 1993 when it was decided that Kongsberg should be partially privatized and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. This gave Kongsberg greater independence and the opportunity to cooperate with private business investors. It helped facilitate many positive changes, such as the establishment of Kongsberg Maritime as a separate business unit. The decision proved to be a crucial building block in the creation of Kongsberg as a modern company.

===1993–2015: International growth===
In 1993, the company Norwegian Defence Technology (NFT) became publicly listed and partially privatized. Two years later, in 1995, the company took the name Kongsberg Gruppen and the current logo was established.

Then followed a long series of acquisitions. This included buying back the maritime division.

The development of the prototype of HUGIN which was demonstrated for Statoil in 1996, later further developed to MUNIN. REMUS is another Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, produced at Hydroid, a fully owned subsidiary of Kongsberg.

In 1997, Kongsberg gathered its operations in the subsidiaries Kongsberg Maritime and Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace.

The development of the weapons station Protector RWS from 1997.

1998: the Air Defence System Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) was pronounced operational.

In 2008, parts of the defence business spun off as a separate business area as &quot;Kongsberg Protech Systems&quot;. Other defence activities continued under the name Kongsberg Defence Systems.

The co-development of Well Advisor together with BP

Also in 2008, parts of Kongsberg Maritime, which had worked with simulation technology in oil and gas, were reorganized under new management. The result was Kongsberg Oil &amp; Gas Technologies that was established as a separate business area. However, due to challenging market conditions in the oil and gas industry this area was consolidated into Kongsberg Maritime and the newly established business area Kongsberg Digital in 2016.

By the end of 2009 Kongsberg was divided into four separate divisions/business areas.

The development of the Naval Strike Missile and the Joint Strike Missile.

In 2014, Kongsberg celebrated its 200th anniversary.

As of October 2017 the business area Kongsberg Protech Systems was merged into Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace.

==Business==


The Kongsberg Group has three business areas: Kongsberg Maritime, Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace and Kongsberg Digital.
* Kongsberg Maritime delivers products and systems for positioning, navigation and automation to merchant vessels and offshore installations, as well as products and systems for seabed surveying and monitoring.
* Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace focuses on command and control systems, weapons control systems, communication systems, missiles, advanced composites and surveillance.
* Kongsberg Digital provides technology, products and services relating to monitoring, integration, analysis, simulation, quality assurance and governance for the oil and gas industry, maritime simulation and the renewables and utilities industry.

===Defence===
Kongsberg has a long history of collaborating with national and international defence industries.

The business area Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace is a provider of command and control systems, weapons control, communications, missiles, advanced composites and surveillance.

A major milestone for the Group&#x27;s defence area came in 2007 when the Group won a contract worth eight billion kroner for the delivery of CROWS II – a type of Protector Remote Weapon Stations (RWS) - to the U.S. military.

The RWS allows the operator to control the weapon inside the vehicle, providing increased protection and reduced risk of both military personnel and civilians. As of today, the Protector RWS claims to be the world&#x27;s leading provider of remote weapon stations. Kongsberg has since delivered more than 17,000 weapons systems to 16 countries worldwide.

Kongsberg&#x27;s largest single contract ever was signed in January 2014 with Oman on the air defence system NASAMS.

In September 2019, Kongsberg unveiled the Vanguard-class multirole warship, designed in collaboration with Salt Ships.

===Space===
Kongsberg has for several years increased its activities in space and surveillance. KONGSBERG&#x27;s space activities are organized under Kongsberg Defence Systems.

In 1990, Kongsberg launched its own aerospace business unit. Through its subsidiaries Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) and Kongsberg Spacetec in Tromsø the company is now a leader in services related to ground stations and satellites. Kongsberg currently operates a worldwide network of ground stations including on Svalbard and Antarctica, used by e.g. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). The acquisition of Horten-based Norspace AS 2011 consolidated space operations in Norway and contributed to KONGSBERG&#x27;s commercial position within international aerospace and surveillance was strengthened.

Kongsberg&#x27;s space division is Norway&#x27;s largest supplier of equipment and services to the European Space Agency (ESA).

Kongsberg&#x27;s Space &amp; Surveillance division delivers a broad spectrum of equipment; systems and services related to space and maritime surveillance customers in more than 40 countries. The portfolio includes equipment and components for the European heavy-lift launcher Ariane 5, communication satellites, earth observation satellites and scientific space probes. The division is a supplier of satellite ground stations for downloading and processing satellite data, as well as a supplier of satellite services from ground stations at Svalbard in the Arctic, the Antarctic and numerous other locations.

The division is also a provider of maritime domain awareness systems and control centers for maritime surveillance, where integration of terrestrial and satellite data constitutes an important component.

Kongsberg&#x27;s Space &amp; Surveillance division is located in Kongsberg, Kjeller, Horten and Tromsø.

===Maritime===
Kongsberg&#x27;s focus on maritime industries began in the early 1970s and coincided with the discovery of oil in the North Sea. This was also the decade in which Kongsberg positioned itself in the petroleum sector. Dynamic positioning (DP) and underwater installations were two areas that would prove to be crucial for the company.

On 17 May 1977 Kongsberg&#x27;s first DP-system was put into operation on board the diving support vessel Seaway Eagle. In 1983, KONGSBERG introduced the first diver-free underwater system for the Gullfaks field. It went on to operate for 20 years.

====Kongsberg Maritime====
Kongsberg Maritime is Kongsberg&#x27;s largest business area. It is divided in three main areas:
* Offshore
* Subsea &amp; Fishery 
* Merchant Marine

Kongsberg Maritime delivers products and systems for positioning, navigation and automation to merchant vessels, Subsea and offshore installations, as well as products and systems for seabed surveying and monitoring. The company is a world leader in dynamic positioning (DP), automation and monitoring systems, process automation, satellite navigation and hydro-acoustics

Kongsberg Maritime&#x27;s activities have in recent years grown steadily. The company&#x27;s supplies to the subsea, offshore and merchant fleet amounted in 2013 to over half of the Kongsberg Group&#x27;s total revenue.

In 2019, the company unveiled its proposed Vanguard-class multirole warship, based loosely on commercial support ships.

====Notable Kongsberg Maritime products====
* Dynamic positioning 
* Subsea installations

==Results==

Figures are in billions.

==Corruption charges==
In 2014 the company and Kongsberg Defence Systems were charged by Norway, for corruption related to deliveries (worth around Norwegian kroner 1.5 billion) of communication equipment to Romania during 1999–2008. The alleged corruption supposedly occurred in Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace, according to Aftenposten.

In spring 2012 &quot;various signals&quot; indicated corrupt practices, and within a short time, investigators from outside the company were put to task. In autumn of 2013 the company discontinued a year-long investigation by PricewaterhouseCoopers—without giving the investigators&#x27; report to the police. The investigation found that funds had been transferred to tax havens.

On 25 February 2014 Økokrim searched company premises in Kongsberg and Asker. On the same day one employee was arrested and charged (and released two days later). The leaders of the company were summoned for a meeting with then Minister of Trade and Industry. On 26 February 2014 the meeting was held, attended by then chairman and then CEO. The board meeting later that day, was joined by the minister via phone.

On 27 February 2014 media said that then chairman had not read the report by PricewaterhouseCoopers about their investigation.

A 28 February 2014 NRK article said that the transaction with Romania was connected with export guarantees worth Norwegian kroner 669 million—from Guarantee Institute for Export Credits (GIEK). Furthermore, &quot;while we [NRK] were at the National Archives to find the documents, representatives from GIEK came to get the folders, supposedly because Økokrim has requested delivery of the documents—from GIEK&quot;. (The folders contained &quot;three of the contracts&quot; [with Romania].) The contracts with GIEK stipulate that bribes and other corruption are in violation of the contracts.

Reactions to the investigation include professor Peter Gottschalk saying that &quot;It is obvious that the company should have contacted the police and not discontinued the case. When financial crime is suspected, the police should be notified. I think that the reason they did not do that, was that they did not want publicity&quot;. A 28 February 2014 Dagens Næringsliv article said that &quot;The question for the company&#x27;s largest owner thru minister of trade Monica Mæland (H)—without regard to what Økokrim uncovers in its investigation—ought to be whether the government&#x27;s companies are best served by having committee members that are that irresolute&quot;. A 5 March 2014 Aftenposten editorial said that &quot;The most important question is another one: Why do such cases appear again and again, despite tightened regulations and attitude campaigns? - Is it time to move focus to the manner in which co-workers are rewarded?&quot; An 18 March &quot;Dagens Næringsliv&quot; editorial said that &quot;The board of directors of Kongsberg Gruppen permitted the [corporation&#x27;s] leadership to put out of sight—the fact finding report regarding possible corruption—without bothering the leadership with bothersome questions. - The minister of trade must evaluate if this is in line with the zero tolerance, that she is trying to &#x27;make more clear&#x27;.&quot;

In August 2016 the case against KONSGBERG was dropped by Økokrim, thus the company no longer being under suspicion or investigation for corruption. Økokrim decided to prosecute a former employee of the company with charges of fraud.

==Cultural sponsoring and controversy==
The Kongsberg Group is a main sponsors of the Kongsberg Jazz Festival.
In 2018 Andreas Røysum started an online petition on iPetitions demanding the festival organizers to end their cooperation with the Kongsberg Group stating the sponsoring being incompatible with the spirit of the festival.

<text>Spitting spiders are a family of araneomorph spiders, the family Scytodidae, first described by John Blackwall in 1864. It contains over 250 species in five genera, of which &quot;Scytodes&quot; is the best-known.

==Description==
Scytodidae spiders are haplogyne, meaning they lack hardened female genitalia. They have six eyes, like most spiders in this group, arranged in three pairs. They possess long legs and a dome-shaped cephalothorax, and are usually yellow or light brown with black spots or marks. Their domed head and three eye groups tend to resemble a human skull, giving them the occasional common name &quot;skull spiders&quot;.

==Hunting technique==
Scytodidae catch their prey by spitting a fluid that congeals on contact into a venomous and sticky mass. The fluid contains both venom and spider silk in liquid form, though it is produced in venom glands in the chelicerae. The venom-laced silk both immobilizes and envenoms prey such as silverfish. In high-speed footage the spiders can be observed swaying from side to side as they &quot;spit&quot;, catching the prey in a criss-crossed &quot;Z&quot; pattern; it is criss-crossed because each of the chelicerae emits half of the pattern. The spider usually strikes from a distance of and the entire attack sequence only lasts 1/700th of a second. After making the capture, the spider typically bites the prey with venomous effect, and wraps it in the normal spider fashion with silk from the spinnerets.

==Pre social behaviour==
Some species exhibit presocial behaviour, in which mature spiders live together and assist the young with food.

==Genera==
, the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera:

*&quot;Dictis&quot; — Asia, Oceania, North America and Seychelles
*&quot;Scyloxes&quot; — Tajikistan
*&quot;Scytodes&quot; — South America, Africa, Asia, North America, Caribbean, Central America, Oceania, Spain
*&quot;Stedocys&quot; — China, Malaysia, Thailand

<doc id="298747" wikidata="Q148349" url="?curid=298747" title="Lambeth">
<text>Lambeth () is a district in South London, England, which today also gives its name to the (much larger) London Borough of Lambeth. Lambeth itself was an ancient parish in the county of Surrey. It is situated 1 mile (1.6 km) south of Charing Cross, across the river from Westminster Palace. The population of the London Borough of Lambeth was 303,086 in 2011. The area experienced some slight growth in the medieval period as part of the manor of Lambeth Palace. By the Victorian era, the area had seen significant development as London expanded, with dense industrial, commercial and residential buildings located adjacent to one another. By this point, there were distinct localities (like Vauxhall) appearing on the map, and a separate parish of South Lambeth was created in 1861. 

The changes brought by World War II altered much of the fabric of Lambeth. Subsequent development in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has seen an increase in the number of high-rise buildings. The area is home to the International Maritime Organization. Lambeth is home to one of the largest Portuguese-speaking communities in the UK, and Portuguese is the second most commonly spoken language in Lambeth after English.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The origins of the name of Lambeth come from its first record in 1062 as &quot;Lambehitha&quot;, meaning &#x27;landing place for lambs&#x27;, and in 1255 as &quot;Lambeth&quot;. In the Domesday Book, Lambeth is called &quot;Lanchei&quot;, which is plausibly derived from Brittonic Lan meaning a river bank and Chei being Brittonic for a quay. The name refers to a harbour where lambs were either shipped from or to. It is formed from the Old English &#x27;lamb&#x27; and &#x27;hythe&#x27;. South Lambeth is recorded as &quot;Sutlamehethe&quot; in 1241 and North Lambeth is recorded in 1319 as &quot;North Lamhuth&quot;.

=== Medieval ===
The manor of Lambeth is recorded as being under ownership of the Archbishop of Canterbury from at least 1190. The Archbishops led the development of much of the manor, with Archbishop Hubert Walter creating the residence of Lambeth Palace in 1197. Lambeth and the palace were the site of two important 13th-century international treaties; the Treaty of Lambeth 1217 and the Treaty of Lambeth 1212. Edward, the Black Prince lived in Lambeth in the 14th century in an estate that incorporated the land not belonging to the Archbishops, which also included Kennington (the Black Prince road in Lambeth is named after him). As such, much of the freehold land of Lambeth to this day remains under Royal ownership as part of the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall. Lambeth was also the site of the principal medieval London residence of the Dukes of Norfolk, but by 1680 the large house had been sold and ended up as a pottery manufacturer, creating some of the first examples of English delftware in the country. The road names, Norfolk Place and Norfolk Row reflect the history and legacy of the house today.

=== River crossings ===
Lambeth Palace lies opposite the southern section of the Palace of Westminster on the Thames. The two were historically linked by a horse ferry across the river. In fact, Lambeth could only be crossed by the left-bank by ferry or fords until 1750. Until the mid-18th century the north of Lambeth was marshland, crossed by a number of roads raised against floods. This marshland was also known as &quot;Lambeth Marshe&quot;. It was drained in the 18th century but is remembered in the Lower Marsh street name. With the opening of Westminster Bridge in 1750, followed by the Blackfriars Bridge, Vauxhall Bridge and Lambeth Bridge itself, a number of major thoroughfares were developed through Lambeth, such as Westminster Bridge Road, Kennington Road and Camberwell New Road. Until the 18th century Lambeth was sparsely populated and still rural in nature, being outside the boundaries of central London, although it had experienced growth in the form of taverns and entertainment venues, such as theatres and Bear pits (being outside inner city regulations). The subsequent growth in road and marine transport, along with the development of industry in the wake of the Industrial Revolution brought great change to the area.

=== Early modern ===
The area grew with an ever-increasing population at this time, many of whom were poor. As a result, Lambeth opened a parish workhouse in 1726. A parliamentary report of 1777 noted it had 270 inmates. In 1835 the Lambeth Poor Law Parish was formed. Run by an elected board of trustees, it comprised the parish of St Mary, Lambeth, &quot;including the district attached to the new churches of St John, Waterloo, Kennington, Brixton, Norwood&quot;. Following in the tradition of earlier delftware manufacturers, the Royal Doulton Pottery company had their principal manufacturing site in Lambeth for several centuries. The Lambeth factory closed in 1956 and production was transferred to Staffordshire. However the Doulton offices, located on Black Prince Road still remain as they are a listed building, which includes the original decorative tiling.

Between 1801 and 1831 the population of Lambeth trebled and in ten years alone between 1831 and 1841 it increased from 87,856 in to 105,883. The railway first came to Lambeth in the 1840s, as construction began which extended the London and South Western Railway from its original station at Nine Elms to the new terminus at London Waterloo via the newly constructed Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct. With the massive urban development of London in the 19th century and with the opening of the large Waterloo railway station in 1848 the locality around the station and Lower Marsh became known as Waterloo, becoming an area distinct from Lambeth itself.

The Lambeth Ragged school was built in 1851 to help educate the children of destitute facilities, although the widening of the London and South Western Railway in 1904 saw the building reduced in size. Part of the school building still exists today and is occupied by the Beaconsfield Gallery. The Beaufoy Institute was also built in 1907 to provide technical education for the poor of the area, although this stopped being an educational institution at the end of the 20th century.

===Local government===
The current district of Lambeth was part of the large ancient parish of Lambeth St Mary in the Brixton hundred of Surrey. It was an elongated north–south parish with a River Thames frontage to the west. In the north it lay opposite the cities of London and Westminster and extended southwards to cover the contemporary districts of Brixton, West Dulwich and West Norwood, almost reaching Crystal Palace. Lambeth became part of the Metropolitan Police District in 1829. It continued as a single parish for Poor Law purposes after the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 and a single parish governed by a vestry after the introduction of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855. In 1889 it became part of the County of London and the parish and vestry were reformed in 1900 to become the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth, governed by Lambeth Borough Council. In the reform of local government in 1965, the Streatham and Clapham areas that had formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth were combined with Lambeth to form the responsible area of local government under the London Borough of Lambeth. The current mayor is Annie Gallop as of May 2021.

=== Modern ===
Lambeth Walk and Lambeth High Street were the two principal commercial streets of Lambeth, but today are predominantly residential in nature. Lambeth Walk was site of a market for many years, which by 1938 had 159 shops, including 11 butchers. The street and surrounding roads, like most of Lambeth, were extensively damaged in the Second World War. This included the destruction of the Victorian Swimming Baths (built in 1897) in 1945, when a V2 Rocket hit the street, resulting in the deaths of 37 people.

In 1948, when the first wave of immigrants of Afro-Caribbean descent arrived from Jamaica on the Windrush cruise ship, they were housed in several areas within Brixton, especially Clapham. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society&#x27;s headquarters were located in Lambeth High Street from 1976 until 2015.

Today, the center of government in Brixton has a strong Afro-Caribbean community. Other significant minorities include Africans, South Asians, and Chinese; they make up one third of Lambeth&#x27;s population. The borough is a very densely populated area within London with a large young population. One third of its working age population are considered living in poverty. Lambeth ranks 8th out of 22 of the most deprived boroughs in London.

==Governance==
At the 2015 general election, the Labour candidate Kate Hoey was elected for Vauxhall. At the snap 2017 general election, Hoey was re-elected with an increased majority. The Liberal Democrat candidate George Turner finished the runner up in Vauxhall achieving a 5% swing in his favour. Hoey stood down at the 2019 General Election and was replaced with Labour MP Florence Eshalomi, who was the sitting London Assembly Member for Lambeth and Southwark. At the next election the boundaries changed to Vauxhall and Camberwell Green and Eshalomi was elected once again.

==Buildings and churches==

The church of St Mary-at-Lambeth is the oldest above ground structure in Lambeth, the oldest structure of any kind being the crypt of Lambeth Palace itself. The church has pre-Norman origins, being recorded as early as 1062 as a church built by Goda, sister of Edward the Confessor. It was rebuilt in flint and stone between the years 1374 and 1377. The tower is the only original part still to survive, as much of the church was reconstructed by 1852. The church was de-consecrated in 1972 and since 1977 it has been the home of the Garden Museum.

Lambeth Palace is the home of the Archbishop of Canterbury and has been occupied as a residence by the Archbishops since the early 13th century. The oldest parts of the palace are Langton&#x27;s Chapel and its crypt, both of which date back to the 13th century. Although they suffered greatly from damage in the Second World War, they have seen been extensively repaired and restored. Morton&#x27;s Tower, the main entrance to the palace, was built in 1490. The Great Hall, rebuilt over different centuries but primarily following damage during the English Civil War, contains the vast collections of the Lambeth Palace Library. Later additions to the palace including the Blore Building, a newer private residence for the Archbishop, which was completed in 1833. The Albert Embankment, finished in 1869 and created by the engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette under the Metropolitan Board of Works, forms the boundary of Lambeth. The embankment includes land reclaimed from the river and various small timber and boatbuilding yards, and was intended to protect low-lying areas of Lambeth from flooding while also providing a new highway to bypass local congested streets. Unlike the Thames Embankment on the opposite side of the river, the Albert Embankment does not incorporate major interceptor sewers. This allowed the southern section of the embankment (upstream from Lambeth Bridge) to include a pair of tunnels leading to a small slipway, named White Hart Draw Dock, whose origins can be traced back to the 14th century. Centuries later, Royal Doulton&#x27;s pottery works used the docks to load clay and finished goods for transport to and from the Port of London. The refurbishment of White Hart Dock was carried out as part of a local art project in 2009, which included the addition of wooden sculptures and benches to the 1868 dock boundary wall.

Located on the Albert Embankment is the purpose-built headquarters of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The IMO is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for regulating shipping. The building was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 May 1983. The architects of the building were Douglass Marriott, Worby &amp; Robinson. The front of the building is dominated by a seven-metre high, ten-tonne bronze sculpture of the bow of a ship, with a lone seafarer maintaining a look-out from Lambeth to the Thames.

From 1937 until 2007 the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade were in Lambeth, on Albert Embankment. The headquarters building, constructed in an art deco style, was designed by architects of the London City Council and opened in 1937. Occupying a prominent position on the Thames it is, however, still an operating fire station, although future plans have been submitted which may see redevelopment of the listed building. A planning decision is expected by July 2023.

The Lambeth Mission is a church of the united Methodist Anglican denomination, located on Lambeth Road. The original church was founded in 1739 but was entirely destroyed by a bomb in the Second World War. A new church for the mission was constructed in 1950 and continues to function as an active church today.

The Beaconsfield gallery is a public contemporary art gallery in Lambeth, which was established in 1995 and specialises in temporary exhibitions and art classes. Morley College is an adult education college, founded in the 1880s, that occupies sites on either side of the boundary between the London boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth.

==Literary Lambeth==
From 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North Lambeth, London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, Hercules Road. In his epic &quot;&quot;, the poet John Milton leaves Heaven and travels to Lambeth, in the form of a falling comet, and enters Blake&#x27;s foot. This allows Blake to treat the ordinary world as perceived by the five senses as a sandal formed of &quot;precious stones and gold&quot; that he can now wear. Blake ties the sandal and, guided by Los, walks with it into the City of Art, inspired by the spirit of poetic creativity. The poem was written between 1804 and 1810.

&quot;Liza of Lambeth&quot;, the first novel by W. Somerset Maugham, is about the life and loves of a young factory worker living in Lambeth near Westminster Bridge Road.

&quot;Thyrza&quot;, a novel by George Gissing first published in 1887, is set in late Victorian Lambeth, particularly Newport Street, Lambeth Walk and Walnut Tree Walk. The novel was intended by Gissing to &quot;contain the very spirit of London working-class life&quot;. The story tells of Walter Egremont, an Oxford-trained idealist who gives lectures on literature to workers, some of them from his father&#x27;s Lambeth factory.

==Geography==
==Parks and open spaces==
Lambeth has several areas of public parks and gardens. This includes Old Paradise Gardens, which is a park occupying a former burial ground on Lambeth High Street and Old Paradise Street. A watch-house for holding the &#x27;drunk and disorderly&#x27; existed on the site, from 1825 until 1930 and is today marked by a memorial stone. Lambeth Walk Open Space is a small public park to the east of Lambeth on Fitzalan Walk and includes several open spaces and play areas. Pedlars&#x27; Park is another small public park in Lambeth, which was created in 1968 on the site of the former St. Saviour&#x27;s Salamanca Street School. Archbishop&#x27;s Park is open to the public and borders the edge of Lambeth Palace and the neighbouring area of Waterloo and the hospital of St Thomas.

==Transport==
The nearest London Underground stations are Waterloo, Southwark and Lambeth North. London Waterloo is also a National Rail station as is Waterloo East which is located in-between both Waterloo and Southwark stations. Vauxhall station is also nearby in Vauxhall, situated more towards the South Lambeth area near Kennington as is Oval station nearby. The South West Main Line runs through Lambeth on the Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct.

The principal road through the area is Lambeth Road (the A3203). Lambeth Walk adjoins Lambeth Road. The current Lambeth Bridge opened on 19 July 1932. It replaced an earlier suspension bridge which itself was built between 1862 and 1928, but was eventually closed and demolished following the 1928 Thames flood.

<text>MPE (Multi-Programming Executive) is a discontinued business-oriented mainframe computer real-time operating system developed by Hewlett-Packard for their HP 3000 computers. While the HP 3000s were initially mini-mainframes, the final high-end systems supported 12 CPUs and over 2000 simultaneous users.

== Description ==
It runs on the HP 3000 family of computers, which originally used HP custom 16-bit stack architecture CISC CPUs and were later migrated to PA-RISC where the operating system was called MPE XL.

In 1983, the original version of MPE was written in a language called SPL (System Programming Language). MPE XL was written primarily in Pascal, with some assembly language and some of the old SPL code.

In 1992, the OS name was changed to MPE/iX to indicate Unix interoperability with the addition of POSIX compatibility. The discontinuance of the product line was announced in late 2001, with support from HP terminating at the end of 2010. A number of 3rd party companies still support both the hardware and software.

In 2002 HP released the last version MPE/iX 7.5.

=== Commands ===
Among others, MPE/iX supports the following list of common commands and programs.
* =SHUTDOWN
* BASIC
* CHDIR
* COPY
* DEBUG
* ECHO
* ELSE
* EXIT
* FORTRAN
* HELP
* IF
* PASCAL
* PRINT
* RENAME
* SH
* WHILE

<text>Lidocaine, also known as lignocaine and sold under the brand name Xylocaine among others, is a local anesthetic of the amino amide type. It is also used to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. When used for local anaesthesia or in nerve blocks, lidocaine typically begins working within several minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine mixtures may also be applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes to numb the area. It is often used mixed with a small amount of adrenaline (epinephrine) to prolong its local effects and to decrease bleeding.
If injected intravenously, it may cause cerebral effects such as confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting. It can cause low blood pressure and an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally safe to use in those allergic to tetracaine or benzocaine. Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic medication of the class Ib type. This means it works by blocking sodium channels thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart. When injected near nerves, the nerves cannot conduct signals to or from the brain.
Lidocaine was discovered in 1946 and went on sale in 1948. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 262nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==

===Local numbing agent===
The efficacy profile of lidocaine as a local anaesthetic is characterized by a rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action.

Lidocaine is one of the most commonly used local anaesthetics in dentistry. It can be administered in multiple ways, most often as a nerve block or infiltration, depending on the type of treatment carried out and the area of the mouth worked on.

For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations. Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures. There is tentative evidence for topical lidocaine for neuropathic pain and skin graft donor site pain. As a local numbing agent, it is used for the treatment of premature ejaculation.

An adhesive transdermal patch containing a 5% concentration of lidocaine in a hydrogel bandage, is approved by the US FDA for reducing nerve pain caused by shingles. The transdermal patch is also used for pain from other causes, such as compressed nerves and persistent nerve pain after some surgeries.

===Heart arrhythmia===
Lidocaine is a common class-1b antiarrhythmic drug; it is used intravenously for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (for acute myocardial infarction, digoxin poisoning, cardioversion, or cardiac catheterization) if amiodarone is not available or contraindicated. Lidocaine should be given for this indication after defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressors have been initiated. A routine preventive dose is no longer recommended after a myocardial infarction as the overall benefit is not convincing.

===Epilepsy===
A 2013 review on treatment for neonatal seizures recommended intravenous lidocaine as a second-line treatment, if phenobarbital fails to stop seizures.

===Other===
Intravenous lidocaine infusions are also used to treat chronic pain and acute surgical pain as an opiate sparing technique. The quality of evidence for this use is poor so it is difficult to compare it to placebo or an epidural.

Inhaled lidocaine can be used as a cough suppressor acting peripherally to reduce the cough reflex. This application can be implemented as a safety and comfort measure for people needing intubation, as it reduces the incidence of coughing and any tracheal damage it might cause when emerging from anaesthesia.

A 2019 systematic review of the literature found that intraurethral lidocaine reduces pain in men who undergo cystoscopic procedures. 

Lidocaine, along with ethanol, ammonia, and acetic acid, may also help in treating jellyfish stings, both numbing the affected area and preventing further nematocyst discharge.

For gastritis, drinking a viscous lidocaine formulation may help with the pain. 

A 2021 study found that lidocaine 5% spray on glans penis 10-20 minutes prior to sexual intercourse significantly improves premature ejaculation. Another study found that lidocaine-prilocaine cream 5% is effective in premature ejaculation and 20 minutes of application time before sexual intercourse.

== Adverse effects ==
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are rare when lidocaine is used as a local anesthetic and is administered correctly. Most ADRs associated with lidocaine for anesthesia relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, and allergic reactions only rarely occur. Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of lidocaine mainly results in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects – CNS effects usually occur at lower blood plasma concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. ADRs by individual organ systems are:
* CNS excitation: nervousness, agitation, anxiety, apprehension, tingling around the mouth (circumoral paraesthesia), headache, hyperesthesia, tremor, dizziness, pupillary changes, psychosis, euphoria, hallucinations, and seizures
* CNS depression with increasingly heavier exposure: drowsiness, lethargy, slurred speech, hypoesthesia, confusion, disorientation, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and apnoea.
* Cardiovascular: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, flushing, venous insufficiency, increased defibrillator threshold, edema, and/or cardiac arrest – some of which may be due to hypoxemia secondary to respiratory depression.
* Respiratory: bronchospasm, dyspnea, respiratory depression or arrest
* Gastrointestinal: metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, agita, and diarrhea 
* Ears: tinnitus
* Eyes: local burning, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal epithelial changes/ulceration, diplopia, visual changes (opacification)
* Skin: itching, depigmentation, rash, urticaria, edema, angioedema, bruising, inflammation of the vein at the injection site, irritation of the skin when applied topically
* Blood: methemoglobinemia
* Allergy

ADRs associated with the use of intravenous lidocaine are similar to the toxic effects of systemic exposure above. These are dose-related and more frequent at high infusion rates (≥3 mg/min). Common ADRs include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremor, and/or paraesthesia. Infrequent ADRs associated with the use of lidocaine include: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, muscle twitching, seizures, coma, and/or respiratory depression.

It is generally safe to use lidocaine with vasoconstrictors such as adrenaline, including in regions such as the nose, ears, fingers, and toes. While concerns of tissue death, if used in these areas, have been raised, the evidence does not support these concerns.

The use of lidocaine for spinal anesthesia may lead to an increased risk of transient neurological symptoms, a painful condition that is sometimes experienced immediately after surgery. There is some weak evidence to suggest that the use of alternative anesthetic medications such as prilocaine, procaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or levobupivacaine may decrease the risk of a person developing transient neurological symptoms. Low-quality evidence suggests that 2‐chloroprocaine and mepivacaine when used for spinal anesthetic have a similar risk of the person developing transient neurological symptoms as lidocaine.

=== Interactions ===
Any drugs that are also ligands of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 can potentially increase serum levels and potential for toxicity or decrease serum levels and the efficacy, depending on whether they induce or inhibit the enzymes, respectively. Drugs that may increase the chance of methemoglobinemia should also be considered carefully. Dronedarone and liposomal morphine are both absolutely a contraindication, as they may increase the serum levels, but hundreds of other drugs require monitoring for interaction.

=== Contraindications ===
Absolute contraindications for the use of lidocaine include:
* Heart block, second or third degree (without pacemaker)
* Severe sinoatrial block (without pacemaker)
* Serious adverse drug reaction to lidocaine or amide local anesthetics
* Hypersensitivity to corn and corn-related products (corn-derived dextrose is used in the mixed injections)
* Concurrent treatment with quinidine, flecainide, disopyramide, procainamide (class I antiarrhythmic agents)
* Prior use of amiodarone hydrochloride
* Adams–Stokes syndrome
* Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome
* Lidocaine viscous is not recommended by the FDA to treat teething pain in children and infants.

Exercise caution in people with any of these:
* Hypotension not due to arrhythmia
* Bradycardia
* Accelerated idioventricular rhythm
* Elderly
* Ehlers–Danlos syndromes; efficiency of local anesthetics can be reduced
* Pseudocholinesterase deficiency
* Intra-articular infusion (this is not an approved indication and can cause chondrolysis)
* Porphyria, especially acute intermittent porphyria; lidocaine has been classified as porphyrogenic because of the hepatic enzymes it induces, although clinical evidence suggests it is not. Bupivacaine is a safe alternative in this case.
* Impaired liver function – people with lowered hepatic function may have an adverse reaction with repeated administration of lidocaine because the drug is metabolized by the liver. Adverse reactions may include neurological symptoms (e.g. dizziness, nausea, muscle twitches, vomiting, or seizures).

===Overdosage===
Overdoses of lidocaine may result from excessive administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children (who are more susceptible to overdose), accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, intrathecal, or paracervical) injection, or from prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgery. The maximum safe dose is 3 mg per kg.

Such overdoses have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults (local anesthetic systemic toxicity). Symptoms include central nervous system manifestations such as numbness of the tongue, dizziness, tinnitus, visual disturbances, convulsions, reduced consciousness progressing to coma, as well as respiratory arrest and cardiovascular disturbances. Lidocaine and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. 

Lidocaine is often given intravenously as an antiarrhythmic agent in critical cardiac-care situations. Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parenteral feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more common.

===Postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis===
Lidocaine in large amounts may be toxic to cartilage and intra-articular infusions can lead to postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Lidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by prolonging the inactivation of the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuronal cell membrane responsible for action potential propagation. With sufficient blockage, the voltage-gated sodium channels will not open and an action potential will not be generated. Careful titration allows for a high degree of selectivity in the blockage of sensory neurons, whereas higher concentrations also affect other types of neurons.

The same principle applies to this drug&#x27;s actions in the heart. Blocking sodium channels in the conduction system, as well as the muscle cells of the heart, raises the depolarization threshold, making the heart less likely to initiate or conduct early action potentials that may cause an arrhythmia.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
When used as an injectable it typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. MEGX has a longer half-life than lidocaine, but also is a less potent sodium channel blocker. The volume of distribution is 1.1 L/kg to 2.1 L/kg, but congestive heart failure can decrease it. About 60% to 80% circulates bound to the protein alpha1 acid glycoprotein. The oral bioavailability is 35% and the topical bioavailability is 3%. Lidocaine efficacy may be reduced in tissues that are inflamed, due to competing inflammatory mediators.

The elimination half-life of lidocaine is biphasic and around 90 min to 120 min in most people. This may be prolonged in people with hepatic impairment (average 343 min) or congestive heart failure (average 136 min). Lidocaine is excreted in the urine (90% as metabolites and 10% as unchanged drug).

== Chemistry ==
=== Molecular structure and conformational flexibility ===
Lidocaine&#x27;s 1,5-dimethylbenzene group gives it hydrophobic properties. In addition to this aromatic unit, lidocaine has an aliphatic section comprising amide, carbonyl, and enyl groups.

Lidocaine exhibits a remarkable degree of conformational flexibility, resulting in more than 60 probable conformers. This adaptability arises from the high lability of the amide and ethyl groups within the molecule. These groups can undergo shifts in their positions, leading to significant variations in the overall molecular configuration.

=== Influence of temperature and pressure on conformational preference ===
The dynamic transformation of lidocaine conformers in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) highly depends on external factors such as pressure and temperature. Alterations in these conditions can lead to distinct conformations, impacting the molecule&#x27;s physicochemical properties. One notable consequence of these variations is the particle size of lidocaine when produced through micronization using scCO2. Changes in the position of the amide group within the molecule can trigger a redistribution of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, affecting the outcome of the micronization process and the resultant particle size.

==Veterinary use==
Lidocaine is commonly used in veterinary medicine in both companion and production animals around the world and is listed as an essential veterinary medicine by the World Veterinary Association and also the World Small Animal Veterinary Association.

In veterinary medicine, it is commonly used as a local anaesthetic both as an injectable or topical product. It provides excellent local anaesthesia when given by local infiltration into a tissue or via specific nerve blocks. These are commonly applied to nerves of the head, limbs, thorax, and spine. It can also be used to treat ventricular arrhythmias when given intravenously. In most veterinary species, when given via injection, it has a rapid onset of action (2-10 minutes) with a duration of action of 30-60 minutes. 

In veterinary species, its metabolism is much the same as humans with rapid metabolism in the liver to the major metabolites MEGX (monoethylglycine xylidide) and GX (glycine xylidide) that retain partial activity against sodium channels. These compounds are further metabolized to monoethylglycine and xylidide, respectively.

Toxicity in animals is similar to that seen in humans with both toxicity to the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system observed. General the CNS signs are seen first with agitation and muscle twitching seen before the cardiovascular signs of hypotension, myocardial depression, and arrhythmias. Further CNS depression will result from higher doses with seizures and convulsions and eventually apnea and death.

It is a component of the veterinary drug Tributame along with embutramide and chloroquine used to carry out euthanasia on horses and dogs.

== History ==
Lidocaine, the first amino amide–type local anesthetic (previous were amino esters), was first synthesized under the name &#x27;xylocaine&#x27; by Swedish chemist Nils Löfgren in 1943. His colleague Bengt Lundqvist performed the first injection anesthesia experiments on himself. It was first marketed in 1949.

==Society and culture==

=== Dosage forms ===
Lidocaine, usually in the form of its hydrochloride salt, is available in various forms including many topical formulations and solutions for injection or infusion. It is also available as a transdermal patch, which is applied directly to the skin.

===Names===
Lidocaine is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN), British Approved Name (BAN), and Australian Approved Name (AAN), while lignocaine is the former BAN and AAN. Both the old and new names will be displayed on the product label in Australia until at least 2023.

Xylocaine is a brand name, referring to the major synthetic building block 2,6-xylidine. The &quot;ligno&quot; prefix is chosen because &quot;xylo&quot; means wood in Greek while &quot;ligno&quot; means the same in Latin. The &quot;lido&quot; prefix instead refers to the fact that the drug is chemically related to acetanilide.

=== Recreational use ===
 lidocaine is not listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency as a substance whose use is banned in sport. It is used as an adjuvant, adulterant, and diluent to street drugs such as cocaine and heroin. It is one of the three common ingredients in site enhancement oil used by bodybuilders.

=== Adulterant in cocaine ===
Lidocaine is often added to cocaine as a diluent. Cocaine and lidocaine both numb the gums when applied. This gives the user the impression of high-quality cocaine when in actuality the user is receiving a diluted product.

=== Compendial status ===

<text>Richard Manning Karp (born January 3, 1935) is an American computer scientist and computational theorist at the University of California, Berkeley. He is most notable for his research in the theory of algorithms, for which he received a Turing Award in 1985, The Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science in 2004, and the Kyoto Prize in 2008.

Karp was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering (1992) for major contributions to the theory and application of NP-completeness, constructing efficient combinatorial algorithms, and applying probabilistic methods in computer science.

== Biography ==
Born to parents Abraham and Rose Karp in Boston, Massachusetts, Karp has three younger siblings: Robert, David, and Carolyn. His family was Jewish, and he grew up in a small apartment, in a then mostly Jewish neighborhood of Dorchester in Boston.

Both his parents were Harvard graduates (his mother eventually obtaining her Harvard degree at age 57 after taking evening courses), while his father had had ambitions to go to medical school after Harvard, but became a mathematics teacher as he could not afford the medical school fees. He attended Harvard University, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1955, his master&#x27;s degree in 1956, and his Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1959. He started working at IBM&#x27;s Thomas J. Watson Research Center.

In 1968, he became professor of computer science, mathematics, and operations research at the University of California, Berkeley. Karp was the first associate chair of the Computer Science Division within the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Apart from a 4-year period as a professor at the University of Washington, he has remained at Berkeley. From 1988 to 1995 and 1999 to the present he has also been a research scientist at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, where he currently leads the Algorithms Group.

Richard Karp was awarded the National Medal of Science, and was the recipient of the Harvey Prize of the Technion and the 2004 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science for his insights into computational complexity. In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. He is the recipient of several honorary degrees and a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

In 2012, Karp became the founding director of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at the University of California, Berkeley.

== Work ==
Karp has made many important discoveries in computer science, combinatorial algorithms, and operations research. His major current research interests include bioinformatics.

In 1962 he co-developed with Michael Held the Held–Karp algorithm, an exact exponential-time algorithm for the travelling salesman problem.

In 1971 he co-developed with Jack Edmonds the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, and in 1972 he published a landmark paper in complexity theory, &quot;Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems&quot;, in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete.

In 1973 he and John Hopcroft published the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm, the fastest known method for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs.

In 1980, along with Richard J. Lipton, Karp proved the Karp–Lipton theorem (which proves that if SAT can be solved by Boolean circuits with a polynomial number of logic gates, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its second level).

In 1987 he co-developed with Michael O. Rabin the Rabin–Karp string search algorithm.

<doc id="298771" wikidata="Q380051" url="?curid=298771" title="Laser lighting display">
<text>A laser lighting display or laser light show involves the use of laser light to entertain an audience. A laser light show may consist only of projected laser beams set to music, or may accompany another form of entertainment, typically musical performances.

Laser light is useful in entertainment because the coherent nature of laser light allows a narrow beam to be produced, which allows the use of optical scanning to draw patterns or images on walls, ceilings or other surfaces including theatrical smoke and fog without refocusing for the differences in distance, as is common with video projection. This inherently more focused beam is also extremely visible, and is often used as an effect. Sometimes the beams are &quot;bounced&quot; to different positions with mirrors to create laser sculptures.

== Function ==

=== Scanning ===
Laser scanners reflect the laser beam on small mirrors which are mounted on galvanometers to which a control voltage is applied. The beam is deflected a certain amount which correlates to the amount of voltage applied to the galvanometer scanner. Two galvanometer scanners can enable X-Y control voltages to aim the beam to any point on a square. This is called vector scanning. This enables the laser lighting designer to create patterns such as Lissajous figures (such as are often displayed on oscilloscopes); other methods of creating images through the use of galvanometer scanners and X-Y-Z control voltages can generate letters, shapes, and even complicated and intricate images. A planar or conical moving beam aimed through atmospheric smoke or fog can display a plane or cone of light known as a &quot;laser tunnel&quot; effect.

=== Diffraction ===
A less complicated way of spreading the laser beam is by means of diffraction. A grating splits the monochromatic light into several rays, and by using holograms, essentially complicated gratings, the beam can be split into various patterns.

Diffraction uses something referred to as the Huygens-Fresnel principle. The basic idea is that on every wavefront exists a forward propagating spherical wavelet of light. The initial wavefront manifests itself in the form of a straight line, as if the subject was seeing a wave coming in towards themselves in the water. Aspects of the spherical waves that divert sideways are cancelled with the sideways components of the wave points on each respect point on either side. Diffraction is the primary method that many simple laser projectors work. Light is projected out towards multiple points.

=== Static beams ===
Uninterrupted stationary beams from one or more laser emitters are used to create aerial beam effects, which are turned on and off at varying intervals to create a sense of excitement. As the laser beam is not manipulated in any way, this could be considered the simplest form of a laser light show and also the least dynamic. Although this method is not as commonly used today due to the availability of scanners, these shows were precursors to laser light shows.

==Safety==
Some lasers have the potential to cause eye damage if aimed directly into the eye, or if someone were to stare directly into a stationary laser beam. Some high-power lasers used in entertainment applications can also cause burns or skin damage if enough energy is directed onto the human body and at a close enough range. In the United States, the use of lasers in entertainment, like other laser products, is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and additionally by some state regulatory agencies such as New York State which requires licensure of some laser operators. Safety precautions used by laser lighting professionals include beamstops and procedures so that the beam is projected above the heads of the audience. It is possible, and in some countries commonplace, to do deliberate audience scanning. In such a case, the show is supposed to be designed and analyzed to keep the beam moving, so that no harmful amount of laser energy is ever received by any individual audience member.

Lasers used outdoors can pose a risk of &quot;flash blindness&quot; to pilots of aircraft if too-bright light enters the cockpit. In the U.S., outdoor laser use is jointly regulated by the FDA and the Federal Aviation Administration. For details, see the article Lasers and aviation safety.
In Europe the standard EN60825 is the reference concerning the conformity of the equipments of every laser-sources-production industries.

Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) is the maximum amount of visible laser radiation considered not to cause harm, for a given exposure time. In many European countries these exposure limits may also be a legal requirement. The MPE is 25.4W/m2 for a period of 250 milliseconds, which is equivalent to 1mW over 7mm circular aperture (the size of the human pupil).

==History==
One of the pioneers in the use of lasers in multimedia productions was the Polish-Australian artist Joseph Stanislaus Ostoja-Kotkowski, whose explorations of their artistic possibilities at Stanford University, California, and later at the Weapons Research Establishment at Salisbury, South Australia led to his innovative &#x27;Sound and Image&#x27; show at the 1968 Adelaide Festival of Arts.

Laser light shows fully emerged in the early 1970s and became a form of psychedelic entertainment, usually accompanied with a live musical performance on stage or pre-recorded music. The Who, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Genesis, and Electric Light Orchestra were among the first high-profile rock acts to use lasers in their concert shows in the mid-1970s. Blue Öyster Cult used laser shows on tours that supported their album &quot;Spectres&quot;, which shows a staged portrait of the band members seated among the laser beams, and Electric Light Orchestra made use of lasers during their 1978 &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; Tour which also featured the famous &quot;Flying Saucer&quot;. This is now highly regulated in the U.S., to the point where almost no U.S. shows have laser beams that go into or close to the audience.

During the social distancing phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, some drive-in theaters offered laser shows. One company managed over 400 laser shows at locations around the United States by August 2021.

<text>Troll is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band.

==History==
Troll was founded in 1992, when 14-year-old Stian Arnesen aka &quot;Nagash&quot; started writing music with Glaurung and Fafnir. When Glaurung and Fafnir left the project, Nagash continued Troll as a solo project and released &quot;Trollstorm over Nidingjuv&quot; in 1995 and &quot;Drep de kristne&quot; in 1996.

Following the release of &quot;Drep de kristne&quot;, Nagash spent more time working with other bands such as Dimmu Borgir and his other band Covenant that he started with Blackheart. Troll was inactive until 2000. By that time Fafnir, now under the name Sinister Minister Twice, had rejoined Troll. Other members were also added, making Troll a group and no longer a solo project. With Nagash concentrating on guitar and synth, Troll released &quot;The Last Predators&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Universal&quot; in 2001.

Significant progress took place between &quot;Drep de kristne&quot; and &quot;Last Predators&quot;. Lyrical content was now mainly English, and the imagery revolved less around Satanic symbols and hate for Christians. The music became less and more symphonic over the years.

In 2007 Nagash had assembled a full line-up for Troll, and began recording a new album in January 2009. That album, &quot;Neo-Satanic Supremacy&quot;, was released in early 2010, and described by one critic as &quot;An entertaining, if somewhat over-familiar slice of 90s-style symphonic black metal&quot;.

<text>Ancient is a Norwegian black metal band from Bergen, formed in 1992. The band released six full-length albums released by Metal Blade Records to date and a variety of mini-albums, EPs and special releases. Ancient used to have the classic raw black metal sound, similar to Darkthrone&#x27;s works. Beginning with &quot;The Cainian Chronicle&quot;, they moved towards a more Nordic/atmospheric black metal sound, akin to Emperor and a cleaner production. After a period of turmoil concerning their line-up, they went on to add gothic-style instruments such as violins, a female vocalist, and synthesizers to their music.

==History==
The band initially started out as a solo project of guitarist Aphazel in 1992. The following year, Grimm joined the band as drummer and vocalist. They released the &quot;Eerily Howling Winds&quot; demo in 1993 and the &quot;Det Glemte Riket&quot; EP in 1994. They subsequently signed to Listenable Records and released their debut album, &quot;Svartalvheim&quot;. After the release of the &quot;Trolltaar&quot; EP in 1995, Grimm left the band.

Aphazel later moved to the United States where he met Lord Kaiaphas of Virginia-based black metal band Grand Belial&#x27;s Key, who soon became the new vocalist and drummer of Ancient. In 1996, the band signed a contract with Metal Blade Records (which led to sellout accusations), and two new members joined the band: Kimberly Goss as a female vocalist and keyboardist, and Kjetil as a drummer. Together, they recorded Ancient&#x27;s second full-length album &quot;The Cainian Chronicle&quot;, a new guitarist/keyboardist entered Ancient under the name of Jesus Christ aka Luci and later embarked on a European tour.

In 1997, Goss was released from the band., Kjetil had left the band. With the new lineup, Aphazel, Kiaphas, Jesus Christ! began Writing, Erichte was recruited as the Female vocalist. Ancient released their third album, &quot;Mad Grandiose Bloodfiends&quot; A Black Metal Gothic classic. After a world tour, Aphazel met Deadly Kristin, who became the new female vocalist, and he decided to move to Italy.

1998 brought more lineup changes: Krigse took over the drums, Dhilorz became the new bassist, and Lord Kaiaphas left the band. In 1999, &quot;The Halls of Eternity&quot; was released, with Aphazel as the new vocalist. 

Upon the exit of Krigse, Ancient went on to find a replacement in the local metal scene. A new tour followed, including the band&#x27;s first concerts in Scandinavia, and in 2000, Ancient played at Wacken Open Air main stage with the new drummer GroM who joined in May 2000. A compilation EP, &quot;God Loves the Dead&quot;, was released in January 2001, featuring some remixes, a new single and a cover of Iron Maiden&#x27;s &#x27;Powerslave&#x27; song.

Ancient&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Proxima Centauri&quot;, was recorded at Los Angered Recording (Andy LaRocque&#x27;s studio) and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York by Chris Athens. Released in October 2001. Another world tour followed, including Mexico, Eastern Europe and Israel. Ancient then proceeded to move closer to their classic black metal origins, although more technical and polished, and began the writing of a new album as a 4-piece without female vocals.

In July 2004, Ancient released their sixth album, &quot;Night Visit&quot;. Written in drummer Grom&#x27;s studio at the feet of the Italian Alps, and Jesus Christ! writing in NJ (USA); the album was recorded at Studio Fredman and mixed by Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström. Following the release, the band embarked on another European tour called &quot;A Night VisiTour&quot; in 2005, with Illdisposed as co-headliners and Final Breath as support. In the end of 2005, GroM left the band and relocated to Los Angeles, CA.

Aphazel and Deadly Kristin released an album with their side-project called &#x27;Dreamlike Horror&#x27;, for Greek label Sleaszy Rider Records in June 2005.

Live, the band featured Aleister of Faust (a cult Italian death metal band) on guitar and following Grom&#x27;s departure, also featured Nick Barker (Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir) on drums.

Ancient&#x27;s original demos, including &quot;Eerily Howling Winds&quot;, were re-released in 2005 in an album called &quot;Eerily Howling Winds - The Antediluvian Tapes&quot;, after which the band went on hiatus.

In 2009 and 2010 they reformed for a new set of live shows in Spain and Portugal with Nick Barker as drummer.

Metal Blade has since then released a three-CD pack containing the band&#x27;s three releases before the final Night Visit album: &quot;The Halls of Eternity&quot;, &quot;God Loves the Dead&quot; and &quot;Proxima Centauri&quot;.

In 2011, band&#x27;s lead singer Aphazel had shortened his artist name to Zel and also announced plans for a new studio album. The album, &quot;Back to the Land of the Dead&quot;, was released in 2016 by EMP Label Group, with the group subsequently signing with Soulseller Records. In early 2016 the band recruited guitarist Ghiulz (Bulldozer) as session guitarist for live performances.

==Svartalvheim + Trolltaar 25th anniversary==
For the 25th anniversary, Ancient toured Europe with the lineup Zel, guitarist Ghiulz (Death SS/Bulldozer), bassist Dhilorz and drummer Volkun (Morost/Sovrag). The tour began early 2020 to celebrate the jubilee of early records Svartalvheim and Trolltaar and went into a forced pause due to the lockdowns.

In December 2022 former drummer Grimm made a guest appearance on the concerts in the Netherlands and Belgium, joining to perform vocals on two songs (&quot;Eerily Howling Winds&quot; and &quot;Likferd&quot;). It was his first appearance with the band in 28 years.

==The Cainian Chronicle anniversary==
In 2023, Lord Kaiaphas joined Ancient as a guest in the Cainian Chronicle tour, performing the entire album. The first performance of the tour was at the Cosmic Void Festival in London. Since then, Ancient has been touring in Europe and other countries performing the album.

<doc id="298775" wikidata="Q701025" url="?curid=298775" title="German Samoa">
<text>German Samoa officially Malo Kaisalika / Kingdom of Samoa (; Samoan: &quot;Malo Kaisalika&quot;) was a German protectorate from 1900 to 1920, consisting of the islands of Upolu, Savai&#x27;i, Apolima and Manono, now wholly within the Independent State of Samoa, formerly &quot;Western Samoa&quot;. Samoa was the last German colonial acquisition in the Pacific basin, received following the Tripartite Convention signed at Washington on 2 December 1899 with ratifications exchanged on 16 February 1900. It was the only German colony in the Pacific, aside from the Jiaozhou Bay Leased Territory in China, that was administered separately from German New Guinea.

==Expansion of German influence==
In 1855, J. C. Godeffroy &amp; Sohn expanded its trading business into the Pacific following negotiations by August Unshelm, Godeffroy&#x27;s agent in Valparaíso. He sailed out to the Samoan Islands, which were then known as the Navigator Islands. During the second half of the 19th century, German influence in Samoa expanded with large scale plantation operations being introduced for coconut, cacao and hevea rubber cultivation, especially on the island of &#x27;Upolu where German firms monopolised copra and cocoa bean processing.

The trading operations of J. C. Godeffroy &amp; Sohn extended to islands in the Central Pacific. In 1865, a trading captain acting on behalf of J. C. Godeffroy &amp; Sohn obtained a 25-year lease to the eastern islet of Niuoku of Nukulaelae Atoll. J. C. Godeffroy und Sohn was taken over in 1879 by Handels-und Plantagen-Gesellschaft der Südsee-Inseln zu Hamburg (DHPG). Competition in the trading operations in the Central Pacific came from Ruge, Hedemann &amp; Co, established in 1875, which was succeeded by H. M. Ruge and Company until that firm failed in about 1887.

Tensions caused in part by the conflicting interests of the German traders and plantation owners and British business enterprises and American business interests led to the first Samoan Civil War. The war was fought roughly between 1886 and 1894, primarily between Samoans though the German military intervened on several occasions. The United States and the United Kingdom opposed the German activity which led to a confrontation in Apia Harbour in 1887.

In 1899 after the Second Samoan Civil War, the Samoan Islands were divided by the three involved powers. The Samoa Tripartite Convention gave control of the islands west of 171 degrees west longitude to Germany, the eastern islands to the United States (present-day American Samoa) and the United Kingdom was compensated with other territories in the Pacific and West Africa.

==Economic development==

During the colonial years new companies were formed to greatly expand agricultural activities which in turn increased tax revenues for public works that further stimulated economic growth; “...over all, the period of German rule was the most progressive, economically, that the country has experienced.” J. C. Godeffroy, as the leading trading and plantation company on Samoa, maintained communications among its various subdivisions and branches and the home base at Hamburg with its own fleet of ships. Since the Samoan cultural envelope did not include “labor for hire,” the importation of Chinese (coolie) laborers (and to a lesser extent Melanesians from New Guinea working for DHPG) was implemented, and “...by 1914 over 2,000 Chinese were in the colony, providing an effective labor force for the [German] plantations.&quot;

Major plantation enterprises on Samoa:
*J. C. Godeffroy &amp; Son (superseded as &quot;Deutsche Handels und Plantagen Gesellschaft&quot; or DHPG)
*&quot;Deutsche Samoa Gesellschaft&quot;
*&quot;Safata-Samoa-Gesellschaft&quot;
*&quot;Samoa Kautschuk Kompagnie&quot;

==History==

===Colonial administration===

The German colonial period lasted for 14 years and officially began with the raising of the imperial flag on 1 March 1900. Wilhelm Solf became the first governor.
In its political relations with the Samoan people, Solf&#x27;s government showed similar qualities of intelligence and care as in the economic arena. He skillfully grafted Samoan institutions into the new system of colonial government by the acceptance of native customs. Solf himself learned many of the customs and rituals important to the Samoan people, observing cultural etiquette including the ceremonial drinking of kava.

“German rule brought peace and order for the first time. ... Authority, in the person of the governor, became paternal, fair, and absolute. Berlin was far away; there was no cable or radio.” The German administrators inherited a system by which some two hundred leading Samoans held various public offices. Over the years, rivalries for these positions, as well as appointments by colonial officials created tensions that dissident &quot;matai&quot; (chiefs) gathered together into a militant movement to eventually march armed on Apia in 1909. Governor Solf met the Samoans, his resolute personality persuaded them to return home. However, political agitation continued to simmer, several warships arrived and Solf&#x27;s patience came to an end. He had ten of the leaders, including their wives, children and retainers, in all 72 souls, deported to Saipan in the German Mariana Islands, in effect terminating the revolt.

Energetic efforts by colonial administrators established the first public school system; a hospital was built and staffed and enlarged as needed. Of all colonial possessions of the European powers in the Pacific, German Samoa was by far the best-roaded; all roads up until 1942 had been constructed under German direction. The imperial grants from the Berlin treasury which had marked the first eight years of German rule were no longer needed after 1908. Samoa had become a self-supporting colony. Wilhelm Solf left Samoa in 1910 to be appointed Colonial Secretary at Berlin; he was succeeded as governor by Erich Schultz, the former chief justice in the protectorate. The Germans built the Telefunken Railroad from Apia onto the Mount Vaea for transporting building materials for the 120 m high mast of their Telefunken wireless station, which was inaugurated as planned on 1 August 1914, just a few days after the beginning of World War I.

The German colonial administrator used the former home of writer Robert Louis Stevenson as a residence; the building is now the Robert Louis Stevenson Museum.

Germany did not experience similar levels of violent anti-colonial resistance in Samoa as it did in Southwest Africa, Cameroon, or East Africa. However, there were anti-colonial resistance movements in Samoa, such as the elite-led &quot;Oloa&quot; and &quot;Mau a Pule&quot; movements, and youth movements against German colonial rule.

===Occupation===

Other than native Samoan police, Germany had no armed forces stationed in the islands. The small gunboat SMS &quot;Geier&quot; and the unarmed survey ship &quot;Planet&quot; were assigned to the so-called &quot;Australian Station&quot; (encompassing all German South Seas protectorates, not the British dominion Australia), but &quot;Geier&quot; never reached Samoa.

British-born Herbert Morley, who was in business in Samoa in 1914, sent a letter dated July 27, 1914, where he tells of six German warships docking off Samoa. The letter was publicized in the &quot;Keighley News&quot; on November 17, 1914.

At the behest of the United Kingdom the colony was invaded unopposed on the morning of 29 August 1914 by troops of the Samoa Expeditionary Force. Vice Admiral Count Maximilian von Spee of the East Asia Squadron gained knowledge of the occupation and hastened to Samoa with the armored cruisers SMS &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and SMS &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, arriving off Apia on 14 September 1914. He determined however that a landing would only be of temporary advantage in an Allied dominated sea and the cruisers departed. New Zealand occupied the German colony through to 1920, then governed the islands until independence in 1962 as a League of Nations Class C Mandate at first and then as a United Nations Trust Territory after 1946.

== Planned symbols for German Samoa ==

In 1914, a series of drafts were made for proposed coats of arms and flags for the German colonies, including German Samoa. However, World War I broke out before the designs were finished, and the symbols were never used. Following its defeat in the war, Germany lost all its colonies, so the coats of arms and flags became unnecessary.

<doc id="298778" wikidata="Q345849" url="?curid=298778" title="Pedro Albizu Campos">
<text>Pedro Albizu Campos (June 29, 1893 – April 21, 1965) was a Puerto Rican attorney and politician, and a leading figure in the Puerto Rican independence movement. He was the president and spokesperson of the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico from 1930 until his death. He led the nationalist revolts of October 1950 against the United States government in Puerto Rico. Albizu Campos spent a total of twenty-six years in prison at various times for his Puerto Rican independence activities.

Campos graduated from Harvard Law School in 1921 with the highest grade point average in his law class, an achievement that earned him the right to give the valedictorian speech at his graduation ceremony. However, animus towards his African heritage led to his professors delaying two of his final exams in order to keep Albizu Campos from graduating on time. During his time at Harvard University he became involved in the Irish struggle for independence. A polyglot, he spoke six languages. Because of his oratorical skill, he was hailed as El Maestro (The Teacher).

In 1924, Albizu Campos joined the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and became its vice president. He was elected president of the party in 1930. In 1950, he planned armed uprisings in several cities in Puerto Rico. Afterward he was convicted and returned to prison. He died in 1965 shortly after his pardon and release from federal prison, some time after suffering a stroke. There is controversy over his medical treatment in prison. Albizu Campos had alleged that he was the subject of human radiation experiments in prison.

==Early life and education==
He was born in a sector of Barrio Machuelo Abajo in Ponce, Puerto Rico to Juliana Campos, a domestic worker of African ancestry, on June 29, 1893. There has been a long debate and confusion over his birthday. Official documents say it was September 12, 1891 while Albizu Campos has stated that his real birthday is June 29, 1893. His father Alejandro Albizu Romero, known as &quot;El Vizcaíno,&quot; was a Basque merchant, from a family of Spanish immigrants who had temporarily resided in Venezuela His father never recognized young Pedro as his son and totally abandoned Juliana, leaving them in poverty. Juliana, started to struggle with her mental health, taking a young Pedro to the river and attempting to drown him with her on various occasions. Luckily, he was saved many times by friends and family but eventually his mother drowned herself on the Portuguese river in Ponce, never to be seen again. From there Pedro Albizu Campos would be raised by his maternal aunt, Rosa Campos.

From an educated family, Albizu was the nephew of the &quot;danza&quot; composer Juan Morel Campos, and cousin of Puerto Rican educator Dr. Carlos Albizu Miranda. His father did not acknowledge him until he was at Harvard University.

Albizu Campos graduated from Ponce High School, a &quot;public school for the city&#x27;s white elite.&quot; In 1912, Albizu was awarded a scholarship to study Chemical Engineering at the University of Vermont. In 1913, he transferred to Harvard University so as to continue his studies.

At the outbreak of World War I, Albizu Campos volunteered in the United States Infantry. Albizu was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Army Reserves and sent to the City of Ponce, where he organized the town&#x27;s Home Guard. He was called to serve in the regular Army and sent to Camp Las Casas for further training. Upon completing the training, he was assigned to the 375th Infantry Regiment. The United States Army, then segregated, assigned Puerto Ricans of recognizably African descent as soldiers to the all-black units, such as the 375th Regiment. Officers were men classified as white. Albizu Campos was black.
Albizu Campos was honorably discharged from the Army in 1919, with the rank of First Lieutenant. However, his exposure to racism during his time in the U.S. military altered his perspective on U.S.- Puerto Rico relations, and he became the leading advocate for Puerto Rican independence.

In 1919, Albizu returned to his studies at Harvard University, where he was elected president of the Harvard Cosmopolitan Club. He met with foreign students and world leaders, such as Subhas Chandra Bose, the Indian Nationalist leader, and the Hindu poet Rabindranath Tagore. He became interested in the cause of Indian independence and also helped to establish several centers in Boston for Irish independence. Through this work, Albizu Campos met the Irish leader Éamon de Valera and later became a consultant in the drafting of the constitution of the Irish Free State. Also while at Harvard University he co-founded the university&#x27;s Knights of Columbus chapter along with other Catholic students.

Albizu graduated from Harvard Law School in 1921 while simultaneously studying literature, philosophy, Chemical Engineering, and Military Science at Harvard College. He was fluent in six modern and two classical languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Latin, and ancient Greek.

Upon graduation from law school, Albizu Campos was recruited for prestigious positions, including a law clerkship to the U.S. Supreme Court, a diplomatic post with the U.S. State Department, the regional vice-presidency (Caribbean region) of a U.S. agricultural syndicate, and a tenured faculty appointment to the University of Puerto Rico.

On June 23, 1921, after graduating from Harvard Law School, Albizu returned to Puerto Rico—but without his law diploma. He had been the victim of racial discrimination by one of his professors. He delayed Albizu Campos&#x27; third-year final exams for courses in Evidence and Corporations. Albizu was about to graduate with the highest grade-point average in his entire law school class. As such, he was scheduled to give the valedictory speech during the graduation ceremonies. His professor delayed his exams so that he could not complete his work, and avoided the &quot;embarrassment&quot; of a Puerto Rican law valedictorian.

Albizu Campos left the United States, took and passed the required two exams in Puerto Rico, and in June 1922 received his law degree by mail. He passed the bar exam and was admitted to the bar in Puerto Rico on February 11, 1924.

===Marriage===
In 1922, Albizu married Dr. Laura Meneses, a Peruvian biochemist whom he had met at Harvard University. They had four children named Pedro, Laura, Rosa Emilia, and Héctor.

==Historical context==
After nearly four hundred years of colonial domination under the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico finally received its colonial autonomy in 1898 through a &quot;Carta de Autonomía&quot; (Charter of Autonomy). This Charter of Autonomy was signed by Spanish Prime Minister Práxedes Mateo Sagasta and ratified by the Spanish Cortes.

Despite this, just a few months later, the United States claimed ownership of the island as part of the Treaty of Paris, which concluded the Spanish–American War. Persons opposed to the takeover over the years joined in what became the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Their position was that, as a matter of international law, the Treaty of Paris could not empower the Spanish to &quot;give&quot; to the United States what was no longer theirs.

Several years after leaving Puerto Rico, in 1913 Charles Herbert Allen, the former first civilian U.S. governor of the island, became president of the American Sugar Refining Company, the largest of its kind in the world. In 1915, he resigned to reduce his responsibilities, but stayed on the board. This company was later renamed as the Domino Sugar company. According to historian Federico Ribes Tovar, Charles Allen leveraged his governorship of Puerto Rico into a controlling interest over the entire Puerto Rican economy.

==Early career==

===Puerto Rican Nationalist Party leadership===
Nationalist activists wanted independence from foreign banks, absentee plantation owners, and United States colonial rule. Accordingly, they started organizing in Puerto Rico.

In 1919, José Coll y Cuchí, a member of the Union Party of Puerto Rico, took followers with him to form the Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico in San Juan, to work for independence. They gained legislative approval to repatriate the remains of Ramón Emeterio Betances, the Puerto Rican patriot, from Paris, France.

By the 1920s, two other pro-independence organizations had formed on the Island: the Nationalist Youth and the Independence Association of Puerto Rico. The Independence Association was founded by José S. Alegría, Eugenio Font Suárez and Leopoldo Figueroa in 1920. On September 17, 1922, these three political organizations joined forces and formed the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Coll y Cuchi was elected president and José S. Alegría (father of Ricardo Alegría) vice president.

In 1924, Pedro Albizu Campos joined the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and was elected vice president. In 1927, Albizu Campos traveled to Santo Domingo, Haiti, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela, seeking support among other Latin Americans for the Puerto Rican Independence movement.

In 1930, Albizu and José Coll y Cuchí, president of the Party, disagreed on how the party should be run. Albizu Campos did not like what he considered to be Coll y Cuchí&#x27;s attitude of fraternal solidarity with the enemy. As a result, Coll y Cuchí left the party and, with some of his followers, returned to the Union Party. On May 11, 1930, Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. He formed the first Women&#x27;s Nationalist Committee, in the island municipality of Vieques, Puerto Rico.

After being elected party president, Albizu declared: &quot;I never believed in numbers. Independence will instead be achieved by the intensity of those that devote themselves totally to the Nationalist ideal.&quot; Under the slogan, &quot;La Patria es valor y sacrificio&quot; (The Homeland is valor and sacrifice), a new campaign of national affirmation was carried out. Albizu Campos&#x27; vision of sacrifice was integrated with his Catholic faith.
===Accusation against Dr. Cornelius P. Rhoads===
In 1932, Albizu published a letter accusing Dr. Cornelius P. Rhoads, an American pathologist with the Rockefeller Institute, of killing Puerto Rican patients in San Juan&#x27;s Presbyterian Hospital as part of his medical research. Albizu Campos had been given an unmailed letter by Rhoads addressed to a colleague, found after Rhoads returned to the United States.

Part of what Rhoads wrote, in a letter to his friend which began by complaining about another&#x27;s job appointment, included the following:
Albizu sent copies of the letter to the League of Nations, the Pan American Union, the American Civil Liberties Union, newspapers, embassies, and the Vatican. He also sent copies of the Rhoads letter to the media, and published his own letter in the &quot;Porto Rico Progress.&quot; He used it as an opportunity to attack United States imperialism, writing:
A scandal erupted. Rhoads had already returned to New York. Governor James R. Beverley of Puerto Rico and his attorney general Ramón Quiñones, as well as Puerto Rican medical doctors Morales and Otero appointed thereby, conducted an investigation of the more than 250 cases treated during the period of Rhoads&#x27; work at Presbyterian Hospital. The Rockefeller Foundation also conducted their own investigation. Rhoads said he had written the letter in anger after he found his car vandalized, and it was intended &quot;as a joke&quot; in private with his colleague. An investigation concluded that he had conducted his research and treatment of Puerto Ricans appropriately. When the matter was revisited in 2002, again no evidence was found of medical mistreatment. The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) considered the letter offensive enough to remove Rhoads&#x27; name from a prize established to honor his lifelong work in cancer research.

===Early Nationalist efforts===
The Nationalist Party obtained poor electoral results in the 1932 election, but continued its campaign to unite the island behind an independent Puerto Rico platform. In 1933, Albizu Campos led a strike against the Puerto Rico Railway and Light and Power Company for its alleged monopoly on the island. The following year he represented sugar cane workers as a lawyer in a suit against the United States sugar industry.

The Nationalist movement was intensified by some of its members being killed by police during unrest at the University of Puerto Rico in 1935, in what was called the Río Piedras Massacre. The police were commanded by Colonel E. Francis Riggs, a former United States Army officer. Albizu withdrew the Nationalist Party from electoral politics, saying they would not participate until the United States ended colonial rule.

In 1936, Hiram Rosado and Elías Beauchamp, two members of the Cadets of the Republic, the Nationalist youth organization, assassinated Colonel Riggs. After their arrest, they were killed without a trial at police headquarters in San Juan.

Other police killed marchers and bystanders at a parade in the Ponce massacre (1937). The Nationalists believed these showed the violence which the United States was prepared to use in order to maintain its colonial regime in Puerto Rico. Historians Manuel Maldonado-Denis and César Ayala believe the motive for this repression, especially during the Great Depression, was because United States business interests were earning such enormous profits by this colonial arrangement.

===First arrest===
After these events, on April 3, 1936, a federal grand jury submitted an indictment against Albizu Campos, Juan Antonio Corretjer, Luis F. Velázquez, Clemente Soto Vélez and the following members of the cadets: Erasmo Velázquez, Julio H. Velázquez, Rafael Ortiz Pacheco, Juan Gallardo Santiago, and Pablo Rosado Ortiz. They were charged with sedition and other violations of federal law proscribing subversive activities.

The prosecution based some of its charges on the Nationalists&#x27; creation and organization of the Cadets, which the government referred to as the &quot;Liberating Army of Puerto Rico&quot;. The prosecutors said that the military tactics which the cadets were taught were for the purpose of overthrowing the Government of the United States. A jury of seven Puerto Ricans and five Americans was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, voting 7-to-5 for acquittal. Following the hung jury, Judge Robert A. Cooper permitted a retrial. The second jury was composed of ten Americans and two Puerto Ricans. Following trial, this jury concluded that the defendants were guilty.

In 1937, a group of lawyers, including a young Gilberto Concepción de Gracia, appealed the case, but the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which held appellate jurisdiction, upheld the verdict. Albizu Campos and the other Nationalist leaders were sentenced to the Federal penitentiary in Atlanta.

In 1939, United States Congressman Vito Marcantonio, strongly criticized the proceedings, calling the trial a &quot;frame-up&quot; and &quot;one of the blackest pages in the history of American jurisprudence.&quot; In his speech &quot;Five Years of Tyranny in Puerto Rico&quot;, Congressman Marcantonio said that Albizu&#x27;s jury had been profoundly prejudiced since it had been hand-picked by the prosecuting attorney Cecil Snyder. According to Marcantonio, the jury consisted of people &quot;...who had expressed publicly bias and hatred for the defendants.&quot; He said Snyder had been told that &quot;the Department of Justice would back him until he did get a conviction.&quot;

Marcantonio argued for Puerto Rican rights, saying &quot;As long as Puerto Rico remains part of the United States, Puerto Rico must have the same freedom, the same civil liberties, and the same justice which our forefathers laid down for us. Only a complete and immediate unconditional pardon will, in a very small measure, right this historical wrong.&quot;

In 1943, Albizu Campos became seriously ill and had to be interned at the Columbus Hospital of New York. He stayed there until nearly the end of his sentence. In 1947, after eleven years of imprisonment, Albizu was released; he returned to Puerto Rico. Within a short period of time, he began preparing for an armed struggle against the United States&#x27; plan to turn Puerto Rico into a &quot;commonwealth&quot; of the United States.

==Later career==

===Passage of the Gag Law===
In 1948, the Puerto Rican Senate passed Law 53, also called the &quot;Ley de la Mordaza&quot; (Gag Law). At the time, members of the Partido Popular Democrático (Popular Democratic Party), or PPD, occupied almost all the Senate seats, and Luis Muñoz Marín presided over the chamber.
The bill was signed into law on June 10, 1948, by the United States-appointed governor of Puerto Rico Jesús T. Piñero. It closely resembled the anti-communist Smith Law passed in the United States.

The law made it illegal to own or display a Puerto Rican flag anywhere, even in one&#x27;s own home. It limited speech against the United States government or in favor of Puerto Rican independence and prohibited one to print, publish, sell or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years imprisonment, a fine of $10,000 (US), or both.

Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, then a member of the &quot;Partido Estadista Puertorriqueño&quot; (Puerto Rican Statehood Party) and the only non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, spoke out against the law, saying that it was repressive and in direct violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which guarantees Freedom of Speech. Figueroa noted that since Puerto Ricans had been granted United States citizenship they were covered by its constitutional protections.

===1950s uprisings and second arrest===
Pedro Albizu Campos was jailed again after the October 30, 1950 Nationalist revolts, known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s, in various Puerto Rican cities and towns against United States rule. Among the more notable of the revolts was the Jayuya uprising, where a group of Puerto Rican Nationalists, under the leadership of Blanca Canales, held the town of Jayuya for three days; the Utuado uprising which culminated in what is known as the &quot;Utuado Massacre&quot;; and the attack on La Fortaleza (the Puerto Rican governor&#x27;s mansion) during the Nationalist attack of San Juan.

On October 31, police officers and National Guardsmen surrounded &quot;Salón Boricua,&quot; a barbershop in Santurce. Believing that a group of Nationalists were inside the shop, they opened fire. The only person in the shop was Albizu Campos&#x27; personal barber, Vidal Santiago Díaz. Santiago Díaz fought alone against the attackers for three hours and received five bullet wounds, including one in the head. The entire gunfight was transmitted &quot;live&quot; via the radio airwaves, and was heard all over the island. Overnight Santiago Díaz, the barber who survived an armed attack by forty police and National Guardsmen, became a legend throughout Puerto Rico.

During the revolt, Albizu was at the Nationalist Party&#x27;s headquarters in Old San Juan, which also served as his residence. That day he was accompanied by Juan José Muñoz Matos, Doris Torresola Roura (cousin of Blanca Canales and sister of Griselio Torresola), and Carmen María Pérez Roque. The occupants of the building were surrounded by the police and the National Guard who, without warning, fired their weapons. Doris Torresola, who was shot and wounded, was carried out during a ceasefire by Muñoz Matos and Pérez Roque. Alvaro Rivera Walker, a friend of Pedro Albizu Campos, somehow made his way to the Nationalist leader. He stayed with Albizu Campos until the next day when they were attacked with gas. Rivera Walker then raised a white towel he attached to a pole and surrendered. All the Nationalists, including Albizu, were arrested.

On November 1, 1950, Nationalists Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola attacked Blair House in Washington, D.C., where president Harry S. Truman was staying while the White House was being renovated. During the attack on the president, Torresola and a policeman, Private Leslie Coffelt, were killed.

Because of this assassination attempt, Pedro Albizu Campos was immediately attacked at his home. After a shootout with the police, Albizu Campos was arrested and sentenced to eighty years in prison. Over the next few days, 3,000 independence supporters were arrested all over the island.

===Lolita Lebrón and third arrest===
Albizu was pardoned in 1953 by then-governor Luis Muñoz Marín but the pardon was revoked the following year after the 1954 United States Capitol shooting incident, when four Puerto Rican Nationalists, led by Lolita Lebrón, opened fire from the gallery of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.

Though in ill health, Pedro Albizu Campos was arrested when Lolita Lebrón, Rafael Cancel Miranda, Andrés Figueroa Cordero, and Irvin Flores, unfurled a Puerto Rican flag and opened fire on the members of the 83rd Congress on March 1, 1954, with the intention of capturing world-wide attention to the cause of Puerto Rican independence.

Ruth Mary Reynolds, the American Nationalist, went to the defense of Albizu Campos and the four Nationalists involved in the shooting incident with the aid of the American League for Puerto Rico&#x27;s Independence.

===Later years and death===
During his imprisonment, Albizu suffered deteriorating health. He alleged that he was the subject of human radiation experiments in prison and said that he could see colored rays bombarding him. When he wrapped wet towels around his head in order to shield himself from the radiation, the prison guards ridiculed him as &quot;El Rey de las Toallas&quot; (The King of the Towels).

Officials suggested that Pedro Albizu Campos was suffering from mental illness, but other prisoners at La Princesa prison including Francisco Matos Paoli, Roberto Díaz and Juan Jaca, claimed that they felt the effects of radiation on their own bodies as well.

Orlando Daumy, a radiologist and president of the Cuban Cancer Association, traveled to Puerto Rico to examine him. From his direct physical examination of Albizu Campos, Dr. Daumy reached three specific conclusions: 
:1) that the sores on Albizu Campos were produced by radiation burns 
:2) that his symptoms corresponded to those of a person who had received intense radiation, 
:3) that wrapping himself in wet towels was the best way to diminish the intensity of the rays.

The FBI investigated any doctors who planned to visit and diagnose Pedro Albizu Campos. Dr. Nacine Hanoka (Miami Beach, FL), was thoroughly investigated. In one FBI memo to J. Edgar Hoover regarding Dr. Hanoka, an instruction near the end of the memo stated &quot;The Miami office is requested to identify Dr. HANOKA, determine whether he made a trip to Puerto Rico since 9/30/53, and furnish any subversive information concerning him.&quot;

In 1956, Albizu suffered a stroke in prison and was transferred to San Juan&#x27;s Presbyterian Hospital under police guard.

On November 15, 1964, on the brink of death, Pedro Albizu Campos was pardoned by Governor Luis Muñoz Marín. He died on April 21, 1965. More than 75,000 Puerto Ricans were part of a procession that accompanied his body for burial in the Old San Juan Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Pedro Albizu Campos&#x27;s legacy is the subject of discussion among supporters and detractors. Lolita Lebrón called him &quot;Puerto Rico&#x27;s most visionary leader&quot; and nationalists consider him &quot;one of the island&#x27;s greatest patriots of the 20th century.&quot; In describing his legacy, social scientist Juan Manuel Carrión wrote that &quot;Albizu still represents a forceful challenge to the very fabric of [Puerto Rico&#x27;s] colonial political order.&quot; His followers state that Albizu&#x27;s political and military actions served as a primer for positive change in Puerto Rico, including the improvement of labor conditions for peasants and workers, a more accurate assessment of the colonial relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States, and an awareness by the political establishment in Washington, D.C. of this colonial relationship. Supporters state that the legacy is that of an exemplary sacrifice for the building of the Puerto Rican nation ... a legacy of resistance to colonial rule. His critics say that he &quot;failed to attract and offer concrete solutions to the struggling poor and working class people and thus was unable to spread the revolution to the masses.&quot;

The revival of public observance of the Grito de Lares and its significant icons was a result of Albizu Campos&#x27;s efforts as the leader of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.

===FBI files on Albizu Campos===
In the 2000s, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) files released under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that the San Juan FBI office coordinated with FBI offices in New York, Chicago and other cities, in a decades-long surveillance of Albizu and Puerto Ricans who had contact or communication with him. These documents are viewable online, including some as recent as 1965.
==Honors==

Albizu Campos has been the subject of hundreds of books and countless articles. He has also been honored both in the United States and in Puerto Rico in many ways:
*In Chicago, an alternative high school is named the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High School.
* La Casa de Don Pedro in Newark, New Jersey is named after him.
*In New York City the Campos Plaza Community Center and housing project in Manhattan are named after him. 
*In New York City, Public School 161 in Harlem is named after him.
*In Puerto Rico, there are streets in most municipalities named after him.
*In Ponce, there is a Pedro Albizu Campos Park and lifesize statue dedicated to his memory. Every September 12, his contributions to Puerto Rico are remembered at this park on the celebration of his birthday.
*In Salinas, there is a &quot;Plaza Monumento Don Pedro Albizu Campos&quot;, a plaza and 9-foot statue dedicated to his memory. It was dedicated on January 11, 2013, the birth day of Eugenio María de Hostos, another Puerto Rican who struggled for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence. Quite unique among Puerto Rican thought, the plaza-monument was erected and dedicated by a municipal government of the opposite (statehood) political ideology as that of Albizu Campos.
*In 1993, Chicago alderman Billy Ocasio, in supporting a statue of Albizu Campos in Humboldt Park, likened him to such American leaders as Patrick Henry, Chief Crazy Horse, John Brown, Frederick Douglass, and W. E. B. Du Bois.

<doc id="298782" wikidata="Q637536" url="?curid=298782" title="Arckanum">
<text>Arckanum was a Swedish black metal solo band formed in 1993 by Johan &quot;Shamaatae&quot; Lahger, who was the only constant member. Arckanum ranks among the most influential and popular in the Swedish black metal scene.

Shamaatae is also an author of occult literature and writes under the names Vexior/Ekortu. His first published work, titled &quot;Panparadox&quot;, was released 13 July 2009 by Ixaxaar. His second book, , was released in December 2010 by Fall of Man. His third book, called , was published on 21 December 2014; it is said to be a &quot;book series&quot; with each book dedicated to the Thursatru tradition. As of 2018, he has published multiple books and has many more to come. He put the band to rest in favour of being a writer.

== History ==
Shamaatae joined his first band, Conquest, aged eleven, the band later evolving into Grotesque. On leaving Grotesque, Shamaatae formed a technical death metal band called Disinterment, who recorded one demo and played a few gigs before splitting up. At the end of 1992, Shamaatae decided to return to black metal and Arckanum was started. Initially a full band, it became a solo project after six months. After several releases, by 1998 Shamaatae had discontinued working with Necropolis Records because they went under, and turned his attention to writing books on the subjects of Pan, Old Norse traditions, runic witchcraft and anti-cosmic Satanism/chaos-gnosticism.

He was still involved in music during this time still working with Arckanum and playing drums with The Hearsemen. Arckanum&#x27;s album &quot;ÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞ&quot; was released on 1 June 2009. &quot;Antikosmos&quot; and &quot;ÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞÞ&quot; featured the guest appearance of Set Teitan of the bands Dissection and Watain. Shamaatae released 3 more full lengths and several EPs and splits before deciding to record Arckanum&#x27;s final album which was released on 29 September 2017 through Folter Records, who are currently re-releasing the band&#x27;s entire catalogue.

Arckanum was split up in 2018 in order for Shamaatae to focus solely on his authorship and spiritual ventures.
On 26 April 2019, Folter Records released , an EP which contains the remixed and remastered recordings that were supposed to be the 1994 demo ; Shamaatae was unhappy with the original recordings and kept the material unreleased until after he disbanded Arckanum.

== Lyrics ==
Arckanum&#x27;s lyrics deal mainly with the worship of Chaos, as well as anti-cosmic Satanism. He is noted for writing lyrics resembling Old Swedish, and he has stated that he tries to write his lyrics as grammatically correct as he can. In his latest three albums however, the language is clearly meant to resemble Old East Norse.

<text>A complete contract is an important concept from contract theory.

If the parties to an agreement could specify their respective rights and duties for every possible future state of the world, their contract would be complete. There would be no gaps in the terms of the contract.

However, because it would be prohibitively expensive to write a complete contract, contracts in the real world are usually incomplete. When a dispute arises and the case falls into a gap in the contract, either the parties must engage in bargaining or the courts must step in and fill in the gap. The idea of a complete contract is closely related to the notion of default rules, e.g. legal rules that will fill the gap in a contract in the absence of an agreed upon provision.

In economics, the field of contract theory can be subdivided into the theory of complete contracts and the theory of incomplete contracts. Complete contracting theory is also called agency theory (or principal-agent theory) and closely related to (Bayesian) mechanism design and implementation theory. The two most important classes of models in complete contracting theory are adverse selection and moral hazard models. In this part of contract theory, every conceivable contractual arrangement between the contractual parties is allowed, provided it is feasible given the relevant technological and information constraints. In the presence of asymmetric information, the optimization problems can be handled due to the revelation principle. A leading textbook exposition of complete contract theory is Laffont and Martimort (2002).

In contrast, incomplete contracting models consider situations in which only a restricted class of contracts is allowed, e.g. only simple ownership structures can be contractually specified in the Grossman-Hart-Moore theory of the firm.

<doc id="298804" wikidata="Q8428168" url="?curid=298804" title="Stored-value card">
<text>A stored-value card (SVC) or cash card is a payment card with a monetary value stored on the card itself, not in an external account maintained by a financial institution. This means no network access is required by the payment collection terminals as funds can be withdrawn and deposited straight from the card. Like cash, payment cards can be used anonymously as the person holding the card can use the funds. They are an electronic development of token coins and are typically used in low-value payment systems or where network access is difficult or expensive to implement, such as parking machines, public transport systems, and closed payment systems in locations such as ships.

Stored-value cards differ from debit cards, where money is on deposit with the issuer, and credit cards which are subject to credit limits set by the issuer and are connected to accounts at financial institutions. Another difference between stored-value cards and debit and credit cards is that debit and credit cards are usually issued in the name of individual account holders, while stored-value cards may be anonymous, as in the case of gift cards. Stored-value cards are prepaid money cards and may be disposed when the value is used, or the card value may be topped up, as in the case of telephone calling cards or when used as a fare card.

The term &quot;closed-loop&quot; means the funds and/or data are physically stored on the token or card in the form of binary-coded data. This is unlike payment cards where data is maintained on the card issuer&#x27;s computers. Like payment cards, value can be accessed using a magnetic stripe, chip or radio-frequency identification (RFID) embedded in the card; or by entering a code number, printed on the card, into a telephone or other numeric keypad.

==Names==
There is no common name for stored-value cards, which are country or company specific. Names for stored-value cards include APPH in US, Mondex in Canada, Chipknip in the Netherlands, Geldkarte in Germany, Quick in Austria, Moneo in France, Proton in Belgium, &quot;Carta prepagata&quot; (&quot;Prepaid card&quot;) in Italy, FeliCa-cards such as Suica in Japan, China T-Union in mainland China, EZ-Link and NETS (CashCard and FlashPay) in Singapore, Papara Card in Turkey, Octopus card in Hong Kong, SUBE card in Argentina, T-Cash in the Philippines and Touch &#x27;n Go and MyRapid Card in Malaysia.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury manages three stored-value card programs: EZpay, EagleCash, and Navy Cash. Non-government stored-value cards include Aramark GuestExpress, Compass Zipthru, and Freedompay FreetoGo.

==Uses==

Stored-value cards are most commonly used for low-value transactions, such as transit system farecards, telephone prepaid calling cards, cafeterias, or for micropayments in shops or vending machines. They also have an advantage over most other payment cards in that when making, say, a purchase, telecommunication facilities are not needed, which may be important in situations where the availability or reliability of these facilities are uncertain or costly, especially for low-value transactions. A benefit to the merchant is that bank transaction fees are not incurred as the transaction is processed offline and there need not be a reference to the bank for processing. A limitation is that these cards cannot be used for online, telephone, mail order and other &quot;card not present transactions&quot;.

The German Geldkarte and the Austrian Quick card can also be used to validate a customer&#x27;s age at cigarette vending machines.

Typical applications of organization specific or industry specific prepaid card include payroll cards, rebate cards, gift cards, cafeteria cards and travel cards and U.S. based health schemes such as HSA cards. The EZpay, EagleCash, and Navy Cash cards are used by the U.S. military as electronic alternatives to cash in areas characterized by difficult access and limited banking or telecommunications infrastructure.

Stored-value cards can save organizations a considerable amount of money if customers add a large sum of funds at one time to the card and then pay a lower transaction fee for each use of the card on smaller purchases.

== Prepaid cards ==

===Closed system prepaid cards===
Closed system prepaid cards are cards issued by a merchant and may only be redeemed for purchases from the merchant. They are typically of fixed amounts and are commonly known as merchant gift cards or store cards. These cards are typically purchased to be used as gifts, and are increasingly replacing the traditional paper gift certificate.

Generally, few if any laws govern these types of cards. Card issuers or sellers are not required to obtain a license. Closed system prepaid cards are not subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, as they generally cannot identify a customer.

As debts owed to consumers who purchased the card, these purchases remain on the books of a merchant as a liability rather than an asset. Consequently, gift certificates and merchant gift cards have fallen under state escheat or abandoned property laws (APL). However, the emergence of closed system prepaid cards has blurred the applicability of APL. North Carolina and Illinois have excluded these types of cards from APL provided the card has no expiration date or a service fee. Maine and Virginia require the issuer to pay the state when the cards are abandoned. In Connecticut an issuer is required to identify the residence of the gift card owner. Since most merchant gift cards are anonymous, the residence of the card&#x27;s owner is deemed to be the state&#x27;s treasurer&#x27;s office.

Presently, no law requires a merchant to provide refunds for lost or stolen cards. Whether a refund is possible is specified in an issuer&#x27;s cardholder agreement. In addition, most closed system cards cannot be redeemed for cash. When a cardholder redeems all but an insignificant portion of the card on merchandise, that amount is generally lost and is a windfall gain for the issuing merchant. The merchant also obtains a windfall gain if a card has an expiry date and the cardholder fails to use the full value by that date. Furthermore, the merchant has an interest-free use of the value until it is redeemed.

===Semi-closed system prepaid cards===
Semi-closed system prepaid cards are similar to closed system prepaid cards. However, cardholders are permitted to redeem the cards at multiple merchants within a geographic area. These types of cards are issued by a third party, rather than the retailer who accepts the card. Examples include university cards and mall gift cards. The laws governing these types of cards are unsettled. Depending on the state, the issuer may or may not be required to have a money transmitter license or other similar license. In addition to the District of Columbia, the states in the US that require a license include Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. Note, these states explicitly require licensing for card issuers. Other states may have more subtle licensing laws. Under 18 USC section 1960, it is a crime for an issuer to conduct a money transmitting business without a license.
Cardholders generally suffer from the same problems that closed system card holders suffer. It is unclear whether or not Chapters 7 and 11 of the Bankruptcy code are applicable to these types of cards.

==Money laundering==
It is common for countries to place limits on how much currency may be taken out of or brought into a country. However, these limits generally do not apply to money leaving a country in non-cash forms such as on stored-value cards. There is concern that stored-value cards can be used for money laundering, that is, moving offshore funds derived from criminal activities such as drug trafficking. There are reports of these cards being used by Mexican drug cartels to transfer money across borders.

For example, in the United States, it is legal for anyone to enter or leave the country with money that is stored on cards, and (unlike cash in high amounts) does not have to be reported to customs or any other authority. Some members of the U.S. Congress are considering creating laws that would require travelers crossing, entering, or leaving the country to report these cards. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury has published a notice of proposed rulemaking on stored-value cards in the June 28, 2010 edition of the &quot;Federal Register&quot;. The proposed rules would require sellers of prepaid cards to register with the government and keep records on transactions and customers.

<text>Vincent Peter Colaiuta (born February 5, 1956) is an American drummer known for his technical mastery who has worked as a session musician in many genres. He was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1996 and the &quot;Classic Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2014. Colaiuta has won one Grammy Award and has been nominated twice. Since the late 1970s, he has recorded and toured with Frank Zappa, Joni Mitchell, and Sting, among many other appearances in the studio and in concert.

== Career ==
Colaiuta was given his first drum kit when he was seven. He took to it naturally, with little instruction. When he was fourteen, the school band teacher gave him a book that taught him some of the basics. Buddy Rich was his favorite drummer until he heard the album &quot;Ego&quot; by Tony Williams and The Tony Williams Lifetime, an event that changed his life. Colaiuta was also listening to organists, notably Jack McDuff, Jimmy McGriff and Don Patterson.

While a student at Berklee College of Music, when jazz fusion was on the rise, he listened to and admired Alphonse Mouzon and Billy Cobham.

After leaving school, he played local gigs in Boston. He joined a brief tour organized by Al Kooper, then worked in California on an album by Christopher Morris, which Kooper was producing. Although he returned to Boston, Colaiuta was drawn back to California by friends. He took the bus from Boston to Los Angeles during the Great Blizzard of 1978.

After performing in jazz clubs, he won the audition to play drums for Frank Zappa. He toured with Zappa and appeared on the albums &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot;, &quot;Tinsel Town Rebellion&quot;, and &quot;Shut Up &#x27;n Play Yer Guitar&quot;. &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine chose &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; as one of the top 25 drum performances of all time.
In 1981, he ceased touring with Zappa to become a studio musician, recording for the band Pages and pop singer Gino Vannelli. Opportunities arose with saxophonist Tom Scott and bassist Larry Klein, who invited Colaiuta to play on a record by Klein&#x27;s then-girlfriend, Joni Mitchell. When Klein and Mitchell got married, Colaiuta was the best man at their wedding. During the 1980s, he toured with Mitchell.

In 1986, he became the house drummer of &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;. The band, called the Party Boys and the Tramp, was led by Mark Hudson.

By the end of the 1980s he was recording albums, TV and film work during the day, and playing clubs at night. In addition to pop acts, he has worked with jazz musicians Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Buell Neidlinger, and the Buddy Rich Big Band.

In 1990, Colaiuta got a phone call from Sting, flew to England, and won the audition to become a member of his band. He remained with Sting for much of the 1990s, touring and recording the albums &quot;Ten Summoner&#x27;s Tales&quot; (1993), &quot;Mercury Falling&quot; (1996), &quot;Brand New Day&quot; (1999) and &quot;Sacred Love&quot; (2003). 
In 1994, Colaiuta released his debut solo album.

On November 12, 2016, he played with Sting in the first concert to be held at the Bataclan in Paris since the terrorist attack a year earlier.

He has won over fifteen Drummer of the Year awards from &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual reader polls. These include ten awards in the &quot;Best Overall&quot; category.

<text>Mitchell Frederick Hepburn (August 12, 1896 – January 5, 1953) was the 11th premier of Ontario, from 1934 to 1942. He was the youngest premier in Ontario history, becoming premier at age 37. He was the only Ontario Liberal Party leader in the 20th century to lead his party to two majorities.

==Early life==

Born in St. Thomas, Ontario, Hepburn attended school in Elgin County and hoped to become a lawyer. His formal education ended abruptly, however, when someone threw an apple at a visiting dignitary, Sir Adam Beck, and knocked his silk top hat off his head. Hepburn was accused of the deed and denied it but refused to identify the culprit. Refusing to apologize, he walked out of his high school and obtained a job as a bank clerk at the Canadian Bank of Commerce where he worked from 1913 to 1917. He eventually became an accountant at the bank&#x27;s Winnipeg branch.

At the outbreak of World War I, Hepburn had already enlisted in the 34th Fort Garry Horse but was unable to obtain his parents&#x27; consent to sign up for the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He then became a lieutenant in the 25th Elgin Regiment of the Canadian Militia, and was conscripted to the 1st (Western Ontario) Battalion in 1918. He transferred to the Royal Air Force and was sent to Deseronto for training but suffered injuries in an automobile accident that summer, followed by being bedridden by the influenza in the fall, both of which kept him from active service. He returned to St. Thomas to run his family&#x27;s onion farm.

==Early political career==

After the war, Hepburn joined the United Farmers of Ontario (UFO) helping to start its branch in Elgin County, but by the mid-1920s he switched to the Liberal Party. In the 1926 election, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a representative of Elgin West and was overwhelmingly re-elected in the 1930 election.

Later that year he became leader of the Liberal Party of Ontario. His support of farmers and free trade, and his former membership in the UFO allowed him to attract Harry Nixon&#x27;s rump of UFO Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) into the Liberal Party (as Liberal-Progressives). This and the Great Depression led to the defeat of the unpopular Conservative premier George Stewart Henry in the 1934 provincial election. His stance against the prohibition of alcohol allowed him to break the Liberal Party from the militant prohibitionist stance that had helped reduce it to a rural, Protestant southwestern Ontario rump in the 1920s.

Hepburn represented a type of agrarian democracy that detested Toryism and valued oratory. He once saw a pile of manure situated in a village square, and proceeded to jump on top of it to give a speech, apologizing to the crowd for speaking from a Tory platform. He also used the same line when standing on a manure spreader, only to have a heckler shout, &quot;Well, wind &#x27;er up Mitch, because she&#x27;s never carried a bigger load!&quot;

On his death, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; observed:

==Premier of Ontario==

Hepburn&#x27;s premiership achieved international attention, which merited his appearance on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s cover in 1937.

As premier, Hepburn undertook a number of measures that enhanced his reputation as the practitioner of a highly vigorous style. In a public show of austerity, he closed Chorley Park, the residence of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, auctioned off the chauffeur driven limousines that had been used by the previous Conservative cabinet, and fired many civil servants. To improve the province&#x27;s welfare, he gave money to mining industries in Northern Ontario and introduced compulsory milk pasteurization (in so doing, he has been credited with virtually wiping out bovine tuberculosis in the province). Breaking with the temperance stance of previous Liberal governments, Hepburn expanded the availability of liquor by allowing hotels to sell beer and wine.

===Industrial labour reform===
The &quot;Industrial Standards Act&quot;, which emulated the US &quot;National Industrial Recovery Act&quot; and the Quebec Arcand Act, was introduced in 1935 to set minimum wages and working conditions by industry and geographic area. It was described by Labour Minister David Croll as &quot;the most controversial piece of legislation now on the Statute Books of the Province,&quot; and it came about after federal efforts that had been instituted under RB Bennett&#x27;s &quot;New Deal&quot; were declared unconstitutional.

===Guardianship of Dionne quintuplets===
The government also made international news by making the Dionne quintuplets wards of the provincial Crown in response to public outrage of plans by promoters to exploit the infants by putting them on display at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. The Legislative Assembly passed legislation in that regard and subsequently replaced it in 1944; it was not repealed until 2006.

===Tax collection===

As Treasurer of Ontario, Hepburn adopted a more aggressive approach in the collection of succession duty on large estates, which resulted in millions of dollars in extra government revenues. He made no apologies for doing so, as he noted in a speech in 1938:

One estate that was of particular focus in this campaign was that of the late John Rudolphus Booth, who had died in 1925. Although succession duties of $4.28 million ($ in current terms) were paid in 1927, Hepburn subsequently claimed more in 1937 and had the Legislative Assembly of Ontario pass the necessary legislation to overcome the legal obstacles. Booth&#x27;s heirs eventually paid another $3 million ($ in current terms) in 1939.

===Cancellation of Hydro contracts===
As part of his drive to cut government spending, the &quot;Power Commission Act, 1935&quot;, was passed to cancel contracts that the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario had signed between 1926 and 1930 for delivery of electricity from power plants in Quebec by declaring them to be &quot;void and unenforceable.&quot; The move temporarily shut Ontario out of world bond markets. The Act was declared to be &quot;ultra vires&quot; by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1937 as being legislation in derogation of extraprovincial rights (although later jurisprudence has suggested that the Court may have overreached in its rulings). Many such contracts were later renegotiated at lower volumes and prices.

===Taking back forests===

Hepburn took an aggressive position with respect to timber licences in Northern Ontario that were being held by companies that would (or could) not cut wood on them. In that regard, in 1936 the &quot;Forest Resources Regulation Act&quot; was passed to grant the government broad powers for mandating minimum production quotas, maximum limits in line with good forestry practice, reduce licensed acreages that were in excess of requirements, and increase stumpage fees on companies &quot;operating or carrying on business in a manner detrimental to the public interest.&quot; Great Lakes Paper saw its holdings reduced from to , and was assessed a $500,000 penalty ($ in current terms) for refusing to participate in a minimum price agreement set up by the Ontario and Quebec governments.

In 1937, the &quot;Settlers&#x27; Pulpwood Protection Act&quot; was passed to govern the supply of pulpwood from private lands, together with fixing quotas and prices to be followed.

The &quot;Crown Timber Act&quot;&#x27;s provisions, which had been in effect since the time of Arthur Sturgis Hardy and required logs to be manufactured as timber before they could exported from the province, were relaxed by order in council in 1936 to create employment opportunities in the logging industry.

When the Abitibi Power and Paper Company, in receivership since 1932, was ordered into liquidation in 1940, Hepburn appointed a Royal Commission to investigate the matter to determine the best course of resolution. The Legislative Assembly imposed a moratorium on liquidation proceedings in 1941, which was ultimately upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1943. The Commission&#x27;s recommended plan was accepted by all creditors. It would emerge from receivership in 1946, after one of the longest such receiverships in Canadian history.

===Fight with CIO===
In later years, Hepburn would form a Liberal–Labour alliance with the Communist Party of Canada, but as premier, he opposed unions and refused to let the CIO form unions in Ontario. On April 8, 1937, the CIO-backed General Motors plant in Oshawa went on strike and demanded an eight-hour workday, a seniority system, and the recognition of its CIO-affiliated United Auto Workers union. The strikers were also supported by the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which was Canada&#x27;s main left-wing party. Hepburn, then professing a deep concern about radicals among auto workers, was supported by the owners of the plant and General Motors when he organized a volunteer police force to help him put down the strike after Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had refused to send the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The force was somewhat derisively known as &quot;Hepburn&#x27;s Hussars&quot; or the &quot;Sons of Mitches.&quot; Cabinet ministers who disagreed with Hepburn over the issue were forced to resign. However, the strike held out, and Hepburn capitulated on April 23, 1937.

===Conflict with Mackenzie King===
Hepburn remained a bitter opponent of Mackenzie King after the strike and harshly criticized King&#x27;s war effort in 1940 after the outbreak of World War II had caused a resolution in the legislature to be passed 44-10 to accuse the federal government of mishandling the war effort. The Conservative opposition voted unanimously for the resolution, but the motion split the governing Liberals, with nine members of Hepburn&#x27;s caucus voting against and others leaving the chamber before the vote. Hepburn, thinking that Canada should be doing more to support the war, helped to organize the military districts in Ontario and encouraged men to volunteer when Mackenzie King chose not to introduce conscription.

Hepburn supported King&#x27;s opponent, Arthur Meighen, in a by-election in Toronto in 1942, despite Hepburn&#x27;s later alliance with the Communist Party of Canada. Meighen&#x27;s unusual source of support did not bring him to success, and he lost the by-election since the Liberals did not run a candidate, and King ordered party resources to be sent to the CCF candidate. However, King was politically much stronger than Hepburn; federal Liberal supporters, as well as those who thought an erratically driven rift between the provincial and federal parties to be suicidal, called for him to step down. Hepburn ultimately resigned as premier in October 1942 but continued to serve as Treasurer of Ontario and party leader until the following year.

==Aftermath==
Although Gordon Daniel Conant had become premier, many people continued to think that was in name only. Senior cabinet ministers such as Provincial Secretary Harry Nixon resigned and demanded a leadership convention. Pressure from both provincial and federal Liberals caused one to be held in May 1943. Hepburn finally tendered his resignation as leader (by telegram), and Nixon was elected the new party leader and was appointed as premier.

The Liberals under Nixon were soon routed in the 1943 Ontario election and fell to third-party status, behind the Progressive Conservatives, led by George Drew, and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, led by Ted Jolliffe. Hepburn himself was re-elected in his riding as an Independent Liberal while he was calling for a Liberal-Conservative coalition against the burgeoning CCF. The Liberal caucus unanimously asked Hepburn to resume the party&#x27;s leadership in 1944.

Now branding Drew&#x27;s Conservatives as the greatest menace to Canada, he reversed his earlier criticism of Mackenzie King&#x27;s war effort and campaigned for Liberal candidate General Andrew McNaughton in a 1945 federal by-election. Provincially, his earlier vehement doubts about radicals among auto workers now muted, Hepburn formed a Liberal-Labour alliance with the Communist Party of Canada (then known as the Labor-Progressive Party) for the 1945 Ontario election but lost his own seat in the legislature.

Hepburn retired to his farm in St. Thomas, where he died of a heart attack in 1953. His funeral was attended by five former premiers, and Rev. Harry Scott Rodney observed in his eulogy:

==Legacy==

Hepburn&#x27;s personality was complex, as &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; noted in its obituary for him:

Hepburn was the first Liberal to become Premier since George William Ross, and was the last Liberal Premier to win two successive majority terms until Dalton McGuinty.

In 2008, he had a school named after him. Only miles away from his family&#x27;s farm, Bannockburn Farms, it was officially opened in January 2009.

<text>Joe&#x27;s Garage is a three-part rock opera released by American musician Frank Zappa in September and November 1979. Originally released as two separate albums on Zappa Records, the project was later remastered and reissued as a triple album box set, Joe&#x27;s Garage, Acts I, II &amp; III, in 1987. The story is told by a character identified as the &quot;Central Scrutinizer&quot; narrating the story of Joe, an average adolescent male, from Canoga Park, Los Angeles, who forms a garage rock band, has unsatisfying relationships with women, gives all of his money to a government-assisted and insincere religion, explores sexual activities with appliances, and is imprisoned. After being released from prison into a dystopian society in which music itself has been criminalized, he lapses into insanity.

The album encompasses a large spectrum of musical styles, while its lyrics often feature satirical or humorous commentary on American society and politics. It addresses themes of individualism, free will, censorship, the music industry and human sexuality, while criticizing government and religion, and satirizing Catholicism and Scientology. &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; is noted for its use of xenochrony, a recording technique that takes musical material (in this instance, guitar solos by Zappa from older live recordings) and overdubs them onto different, unrelated material. All solos on the album are xenochronous except for &quot;Crew Slut&quot; and &quot;Watermelon in Easter Hay&quot;, a signature song that Zappa described as the best song on the album, and according to his son Dweezil, the best guitar solo his father ever played.

&quot;Joe’s Garage&quot; initially received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising its innovative and original music, but criticizing the scatological, sexual and profane nature of the lyrics. Since its original release, the album has been reappraised as one of Zappa&#x27;s best works.

== Background ==
After being released from his contractual obligations with Warner Bros. Records, Frank Zappa formed Zappa Records, a label distributed at that time by Phonogram Inc. He released the successful double album &quot;Sheik Yerbouti&quot; (1979, recorded 8/1977-2/1978), and began working on a series of songs for a follow-up album. The songs &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; and &quot;Catholic Girls&quot; were recorded with the intention that Zappa would release each as a single. Throughout the development of &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot;, Zappa&#x27;s band recorded lengthy jams which Zappa later formed into the album. The album also continued the development of xenochrony, a technique Zappa also featured on &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; (1975), in which aspects of older live recordings were utilized to create new compositions by overdubbing them onto studio recordings, or alternatively, selecting a previously recorded solo and allowing drummer Vinnie Colaiuta to improvise a new drum performance, interacting with the previously recorded piece.

Midway through recording the new album, Zappa decided that the songs connected coherently and wrote a story, changing the new album into a rock opera. &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; was the final album Zappa recorded at a commercial studio. Zappa&#x27;s own studio, the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen, built as an addition to Zappa&#x27;s home, and completed in late 1979, was used to record and mix all of his subsequent releases.

== Style and influences ==
=== Lyrical and story themes ===
The lyrical themes of &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; involve individualism, sexuality, and the danger of large government. The album is narrated by a government employee identifying himself as The Central Scrutinizer, who delivers a cautionary tale about Joe, a typical adolescent male who forms a band as the government prepares to criminalize music. The Central Scrutinizer explains that music leads to a &quot;slippery slope&quot; of drug use, disease, unusual sexual practices, prison, and eventually, insanity. According to Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz, Zappa&#x27;s narrative of censorship reflected the censorship of music during the Iranian Revolution of 1979, where rock music was made illegal.

The title track is noted as having an autobiographical aspect, as the character of Larry (as performed by Zappa himself) sings that the band plays the same song repeatedly because &quot;it sounded good to me&quot;. In real life, Zappa said he wrote and played music for himself, his sole intended audience. The song also takes lyrical inspiration from bands playing in bars like The Mothers of Invention once had, and shady record deals Zappa had experienced in the past. In &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot;, Joe finds that the music industry is &quot;not everything it is cracked up to be&quot;. The song refers to a number of music fads, including new wave, heavy metal, disco and glitter rock, and is critical of the music industry of the late 1970s.

&quot;Catholic Girls&quot; is critical of the Catholic Church, and satirizes &quot;the hypocrisy of the myth of the good Catholic girl.&quot; While Zappa was in favor of the sexual revolution, he regarded himself as a pioneer in publicly discussing honesty about sexual intercourse, stating &quot;American sexual attitudes are controlled as a necessary tool of business and government in order to perpetuate themselves. Unless people begin to see through that, to see past it to what sex is really all about, they&#x27;re always going to have the same neurotic attitudes. It&#x27;s very neatly packaged. It all works hand-in-hand with the churches and political leaders at the point where elections are coming up.&quot; This view inspired the lyrical content of &quot;Crew Slut&quot;, in which Mary, Joe&#x27;s girlfriend, falls into the groupie lifestyle, going on to participate in a wet T-shirt contest in the following track, &quot;Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt&quot;.

&quot;Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?&quot; was written in the summer of 1978. Zappa&#x27;s road manager, Phil Kaufman, alleged, that the song was written after Kaufman had asked that very question; within the context of the album&#x27;s storyline, it is sung by Joe after he receives a sexually transmitted disease from Lucille, &quot;a girl, who works at the Jack in the Box&quot;. The Central Scrutinizer continues to express the hypothesis that &quot;girls, music, disease, heartbreak [...] all go together.&quot; Halfway through the album&#x27;s libretto, Zappa expressed the belief that governments believe that people are inherently criminals, and continue to invent laws, which gives states the legal grounds to arrest people, leading to the fictional criminalization of music which occurs towards the end of the album&#x27;s storyline.

&quot;A Token of My Extreme&quot; satirizes Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard, as well as new age beliefs and the sexual revolution. It describes an insincere religion, which co-operates with a &quot;malevolent totalitarian regime.&quot; &quot;Stick It Out&quot; contains lyrical references to Zappa&#x27;s songs &quot;What Kind Of Girl&quot;, &quot;Bwana Dik&quot;, &quot;Sofa No. 2&quot;, and &quot;Dancin&#x27; Fool&quot;. &quot;Dong Work For Yuda&quot; was written as a tribute to Zappa&#x27;s bodyguard, John Smothers, and features Terry Bozzio imitating Smothers&#x27; dialect and speech. &quot;Keep It Greasy&quot; is a lyrical tribute to anal sex. Following Joe&#x27;s imprisonment and release, the libretto describes a dystopian future, accompanied musically by long guitar solos, which Joe imagines in his head. The penultimate song, &quot;Packard Goose&quot;, criticizes rock journalism, and features a philosophical monolog delivered by the character Mary, who had been absent since the first act. In the epilogue song &quot;A Little Green Rosetta,&quot; Joe gives up music, returns to sanity, hocks his imaginary guitar and gets &quot;a good job&quot; at the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen Facility (a self-reference to Zappa&#x27;s own personal studio). The Central Scrutinizer sings the last song on the album in his &quot;regular voice&quot;, and joins in a long musical number with most of the other people that worked with Zappa around 1979.

=== Plot ===

==== Act I ====

At the beginning of the album, we are introduced to &quot;The Central Scrutinizer&quot;, the album&#x27;s narrator, who brings us a &quot;special presentation&quot; on music&#x27;s bad influences on man. We are introduced to Joe, the main character in the presentation. Joe used to be the lead singer in a garage band, which eventually broke up (&quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot;). Joe continues playing his music until a neighbor calls the police, who tell Joe to &quot;stick closer to church-oriented social activities.&quot; Joe starts going to the Catholic Youth Organization (CYO) at the Catholic Church, held by Father Riley, and falls in love with a girl named Mary (&quot;Catholic Girls&quot;).

One day, Mary skips the church club and goes to the Armory. She becomes a groupie for a band called Toad-O (&quot;Crew Slut&quot;). Eventually, Mary, unable to keep up with the band&#x27;s laundry, is dumped in Miami. With no money to get home, she signs up for the local Wet T-Shirt Contest at the Brasserie, hosted by Father Riley (who has since changed his name to Buddy Jones) (&quot;Wet T-Shirt Nite&quot;). Mary wins first place in the contest and wins fifty bucks, enough money to go home. However, Warren, a former member of Joe&#x27;s Garage Band, finds out about Mary&#x27;s &quot;naughty exploits&quot; and sends a letter to Joe telling him about it (&quot;Toad-O Line&quot;). Joe, heartbroken, &quot;falls in with a fast crowd&quot; and gets seduced by Lucille, a girl who works at the Jack in the Box, and has sex with her, only to catch gonorrhea (&quot;Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?&quot;). Discouraged, he sings about Lucille and his feelings for her (&quot;Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up&quot;).

==== Act II ====

Joe is in &quot;a quandary, being devoured by the swirling cesspool of his own steaming desires&quot; and seeks redemption; he decides to &quot;pay a lot of money&quot; to the First Church of Appliantology, owned by L. Ron Hoover, an amount of fifty bucks (&quot;A Token of My Extreme&quot;). He learns from Hoover that he is a &quot;Latent Appliance Fetishist&quot;, learns German, dresses like a housewife and goes to a club called the &quot;Closet&quot;, filled with sexual appliances. Joe meets Sy Borg, a &quot;Model XQJ-37 Nuclear Powered Pansexual Roto-Plooker&quot;, who looks like a &quot;Cross between an Industrial Vacuum Cleaner and a Chrome-Plated Piggy Bank with marital aids stuck all over it&quot;, and falls in love with him (&quot;Stick It Out&quot;). They go back to Sy&#x27;s apartment and have sex, only for Joe to accidentally kill him when a &quot;golden shower&quot; causes his master circuit to short out (&quot;Sy Borg&quot;).

Having given all his money to Hoover, Joe cannot pay to fix Sy and is arrested and sent to a special prison filled with people arrested due to music, who spend all day &quot;snorting detergent and plooking each other&quot;. At the prison, he meets Bald-Headed John, &quot;King of the Plookers&quot; (&quot;Dong Work for Yuda&quot;). Joe is eventually &quot;plooked&quot; by the executives at the prison (&quot;Keep It Greasey&quot;). Having &quot;a long time to go before [he&#x27;s] paid [his] debt to society&quot;, he decides to be &quot;sullen and withdrawn&quot; and sits around dreaming up imaginary guitar notes (&quot;Outside Now&quot;), until he is released from prison (a bit of art imitating life, as Zappa himself did just that during his own prison sentence in 1965).

==== Act III ====

Joe is released from prison into a dystopian society where music has been made illegal and &quot;[walks] through the parking lot in a semi-catatonic state&quot;, dreaming guitar notes. Eventually, he hears the voice of his neighbor Mrs. Borg taunting him in his head (&quot;He Used to Cut the Grass&quot;). Joe becomes scared of rock journalists and sings about them. He sees a vision of Mary appear and deliver a lecture (&quot;Packard Goose&quot;). Joe goes back to his house and dreams his last imaginary guitar notes (&quot;Watermelon in Easter Hay&quot;). Afterward, he &quot;[hocks his] imaginary guitar and [gets] a good job&quot; at the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen, where he squeezes icing rosettes onto muffins. As an epilogue, the Central Scrutinizer turns off his plastic megaphone and sings the final song on the album, &quot;A Little Green Rosetta&quot;, with most of the people who worked at Village Recorders around 1979, with the song growing more chaotic as it goes as &quot;proof&quot; that music is dangerous.

=== Music and performance ===

The music of &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; encompassed a variety of styles, including blues, jazz, doo wop, lounge, orchestral, rock, pop and reggae. &quot;Catholic Girls&quot; makes musical reference to Zappa&#x27;s controversial song &quot;Jewish Princess&quot;, as a sitar plays the melody of the earlier song during the fadeout of &quot;Catholic Girls&quot;. &quot;Crew Slut&quot; is performed as a slow blues song, with slide guitar riffs and a harmonica solo. According to Kelly Fisher Lowe, the song is &quot;more Rolling Stones or Aerosmith than it is Gatemouth Brown or Guitar Watson&quot;. The extended three and a half minute, two-part guitar solo in &quot;Toad-O-Line&quot; is taken from Zappa&#x27;s earlier song, &quot;Inca Roads.&quot;

&quot;A Token Of My Extreme&quot; originated as an instrumental song played during improvised conversations by saxophonist Napoleon Murphy Brock and George Duke on keyboards. It typically opened Zappa&#x27;s concerts in 1974; a recording of this version of the piece was released under the title &quot;Tush Tush Tush (A Token of My Extreme)&quot; on &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2&quot;.

&quot;Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up&quot; first appeared on Jeff Simmons&#x27; album of the same name, on which its writing is credited to &quot;La Marr Bruister&quot;, one of Zappa&#x27;s pseudonyms. The &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; arrangement is radically different, and is played in a reggae style. &quot;Stick It Out&quot; originated as part of the Mothers of Invention&#x27;s &quot;Sofa&quot; routine in the early 1970s. The &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; version is musically influenced by funk and disco, with its lyrics performed first in German, and then in English. &quot;Sy Borg&quot; derives from funk, reggae and R&amp;B.

&quot;Keep It Greasy&quot; had been performed by Zappa since 1975; the &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; album version features a guitar solo from a March 1979 live performance of the song &quot;City of Tiny Lights&quot;. Another March 1979 guitar solo from &quot;City of Tiny Lights&quot; is incorporated into the song &quot;Outside Now&quot; using the same recording technique. &quot;Packard Goose&quot;, which Zappa wrote sometime in 1975, also uses xenochrony, with its guitar solo taken from a March 1979 performance of &quot;Easy Meat&quot;.

The album concludes with a long guitar instrumental, &quot;Watermelon in Easter Hay&quot;, the only guitar solo recorded for the album, in 9/4 time; every other guitar solo on the album was xenochronous—overdubbed from older live recordings. In their review of the album, &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine criticized the song, but subsequent reviewers have championed the song as Zappa&#x27;s masterpiece. Lowe called it the &quot;crowning achievement of the album&quot; and &quot;one of the most gorgeous pieces of music ever produced&quot;. Zappa told Neil Slaven that he thought it was &quot;the best song on the album&quot;. The song&#x27;s title is thought to have come from a saying used by Zappa while recording the album: &quot;Playing a guitar solo with this band is like trying to grow watermelon in Easter hay&quot;. After Zappa died, &quot;Watermelon in Easter Hay&quot; became known as one of his signature songs, and his son, Dweezil Zappa, later referred to it as &quot;the best solo Zappa ever played&quot;.

The song is followed by &quot;A Little Green Rosetta&quot;, a song that was originally intended to appear on Zappa&#x27;s shelved &quot;Läther&quot; album, but rerecorded with different lyrics for &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; was initially released in separate units, beginning with the single LP &quot;Act I&quot; in September 1979. For the album artwork, Zappa was photographed in black makeup, holding a mop for the car grease garage theme. The gatefold sleeve of &quot;Act I&quot; was designed by John Williams, and featured a collage, which included a naked Maya, vague technical drawings, pyramids and fingers on the fret of a guitar. The lyric insert featured similar illustrations, which related to the content of the songs and storyline. The title track was released as a single, with &quot;The Central Scrutinizer&quot; as its B-side. It did not chart.

&quot;Act I&quot; peaked at #27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart. It was followed by the double album &quot;Acts II &amp; III&quot; in November. The gatefold of &quot;Acts II &amp; III&quot; featured collages taken from a medical journal, while the cover for &quot;Acts II &amp; III&quot; featured a makeup artist applying makeup to Zappa&#x27;s face. &quot;Acts II &amp; III&quot; peaked at #53 on the Pop Albums chart.

&quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; was reissued in 1987 as a triple album, combining Acts I, II &amp; III into a single box set, and as a double album on compact disc. The song &quot;Wet T-Shirt Nite&quot; received two alternate titles, when the album was released on CD: the libretto referred to the song as &quot;The Wet T-Shirt Contest&quot;, while the back cover referred to the song as &quot;Fembot in a Wet T-Shirt&quot;. In an interview, Zappa explained that the &quot;fembot&quot; was the name given to a female robot in an episode of the TV series &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;. The instrumental &quot;Toad-O Line&quot; was renamed &quot;On the Bus&quot;. The Central Scrutinizer monolog at the end of &quot;Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up&quot;, which concludes the story&#x27;s first act, was indexed as its own track on the CD reissue, under the title &quot;Scrutinizer Postlude&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==

AllMusic gave 3 out of 5 stars for the individual releases &quot;Act I&quot; and &quot;Acts II &amp; III&quot;. William Ruhlmann wrote of &quot;Act I&quot;, &quot;although his concern with government censorship would see a later flowering in his battles with the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), here he wasn&#x27;t able to use it to fulfill a satisfying dramatic function.&quot; Ruhlmann also felt that &quot;Acts II &amp; III&quot; &quot;seems so thin and thrown together, musically and dramatically&quot;.

Don Shewey of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;If the surface of this opera is cluttered with cheap gags and musical mishmash, its soul is located in profound existential sorrow. The guitar solos that Zappa plays in Joe&#x27;s imagination burn with a desolate, devastating beauty. Flaws and all, &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; is Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.&quot; The collected &quot;Acts I, II &amp; III&quot; release received 4.5 out of 5 stars from Allmusic&#x27;s Steve Huey, who wrote &quot;in spite of its flaws, &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; has enough substance to make it one of Zappa&#x27;s most important &#x27;70s works and overall political statements, even if it&#x27;s not focused enough to rank with his earliest Mothers of Invention masterpieces.&quot;

For his performance on &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot;, Vinnie Colaiuta was named &quot;the most technically advanced drummer ever&quot; by &quot;Modern Drummer&quot;, which ranked the album as one of the top 25 greatest drumming performances of all time. On September 26, 2008, &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot; was staged by the Open Fist Theatre Company in Los Angeles, in a production authorized by the Zappa Family Trust.

The cover was parodied by Swedish rockabilly artist Eddie Meduza on his 1980 album &quot;Garagetaper&quot;.

<doc id="298814" wikidata="Q1362842" url="?curid=298814" title="Jump start (vehicle)">
<text>A jump start, also called a boost, is a procedure of starting a motor vehicle (most commonly cars or trucks) that has a discharged battery. A temporary connection is made to the battery of another vehicle, or to some other external power source. The external supply of electricity recharges the disabled vehicle&#x27;s battery and provides some of the power needed to crank the engine. Once the vehicle has been started, its normal charging system will recharge, so the auxiliary source can be removed. If the vehicle charging system is functional, leaving the engine running will restore the charge of the battery.

Motorists may carry jumper cables and other equipment in case of accidental discharge of the vehicle battery (for example, by headlights, interior lights or ignition switch left on while the engine is not running). Safe procedures for connecting and disconnecting cables are given in the vehicle manual.

==Jumper cables==
Jumper cables, also known as booster cables or jump leads, are a pair of insulated wires of sufficient capacity with alligator clips at each end to interconnect the disabled vehicle with an auxiliary source, such as another vehicle with the same system voltage or to another battery. The alligator clips may be covered in insulation to prevent inadvertent shorting. Clips may be made of copper or steel. Alligator clips are generally marked by black (−) and red (+) to indicate the polarity.

==Limitations==
Operation of a lead-acid battery may, in case of overcharge, produce flammable hydrogen gas by electrolysis of water inside the battery. Jump start procedures are usually found in the vehicle owner&#x27;s manual. The recommended sequence of connections is intended to reduce the chance of accidentally shorting the good battery or igniting hydrogen gas. Owner&#x27;s manuals will show the preferred locations for connection of jumper cables; for example, some vehicles have the battery mounted under a seat, or may have a jumper terminal in the engine compartment.

Jumper cables should not be used to interconnect between different voltage systems; for example, connecting 6V and 12V systems together may cause damage.

If the dead battery is physically damaged, has a low electrolyte level, is decayed or frozen, a jump start will not repair the battery. A vehicle with a frozen battery should not be jump started, as the battery may explode.

==Other methods ==
A hand-portable battery, equipped with attached cables and charger, can be used similarly to another vehicle&#x27;s battery.
A self-contained jump box contains a battery and connects directly to the battery of the engine that needs a boost. Portable boosters may automatically sense the battery&#x27;s polarity prior to sending power to the vehicle, eliminating the damage that can result from reversing the connection. There are various portable jump starters that are multi-functional and can be used to charge other electronic devices as well.

===Cigarette lighter outlet===
An alternative to jumper cables is a cable used to interconnect the 12 volt power outlets (cigarette lighter outlets) of two vehicles. This method slowly recharges the battery, not by providing the current needed for cranking, as the engine cranking motor current draw will greatly exceed the fuse rating in a cigarette lighter outlet. While this eliminates concerns with incorrect connections and generation of arcs near battery terminals, the amount of current available through such a connection is small. Unless current-limiting devices are incorporated into such cables, the probability of opening a fuse or circuit breaker in one of the vehicles during charging is high: and as there is no real standard for available current, potential performance is further limited by conservative design. Many vehicles turn off the cigarette lighter outlets when the key is turned off, making the technique unusable unless the ignition key is turned to the &#x27;accessory&#x27; or &#x27;on&#x27; position, after which the cigarette lighter outlet and battery become electrically connected. It may take many minutes for the battery to charge to the level where it can crank the engine, as current through the power outlet is limited. In contrast, heavy-gauge booster cables transmit much more current from the booster battery and may even be able to supply all the necessary cranking current. 

===Battery charger===
Motorists and service garages often have a portable battery charger operated from AC power. Very small trickle chargers are intended only to maintain a charge on a parked or stored vehicle, but larger chargers can put enough charge into a battery to allow a start within a few minutes. Battery chargers may be strictly manual, or may include controls for time and charging voltage. Battery chargers that apply a high voltage (for example, more than 14.4 volts on a 12-volt nominal system) will result in the emission of hydrogen gas from the battery, which may damage it or create an explosion risk. A battery may be recharged without removal from the vehicle, although in a typical roadside situation no convenient source of power may be nearby.

=== Battery booster and jump starter ===
Some AC battery chargers have a &quot;boost&quot;, &quot;engine start&quot;, or &quot;engine assist&quot; feature. Despite being able to assist in jump starting a dead vehicle battery, these types of battery chargers perform their task over a longer period of time, rather than an instantaneous boost. Boosting a dead battery through a battery charger can take anywhere from five to twenty minutes depending on the depth-of-discharge (DOD), health of the vehicle battery, and type of engine (engine displacement). AC power is not usually available for a roadside boost.

Jump starters are portable battery devices that allow for jump starting of vehicles. These devices operate similar to jumper cables but do not require an additional vehicle to provide the power needed to boost the dead vehicle battery. Jump starters using lead-acid batteries claim 300−⁠1700 amp ratings. The main disadvantage of lead-acid jump starters is weight, size and battery chemistry. Lead-acid jump starters can be extremely heavy and large, making them less than convenient when transporting between vehicles. Lead-acid batteries may self-discharge if they develop a condition called sulfating, which permanently decreases battery capacity. It is entirely possible to destroy a new lead-acid battery within months, requiring a replacement.

Jump starters using lithium-ion batteries began appearing in the market around 2013. Most lithium jump starter brands use a high discharge lithium polymer or lithium-ion battery. Lithium jump starters are compact and lightweight compared to their lead-acid equivalents. These jump starters often incorporate a USB connection, allowing it to function as a portable charger for mobile electronic devices.

===Push starting===

A vehicle with a manual transmission may be push started. This requires caution while pushing the vehicle and may require the assistance of several persons or another vehicle. If the vehicle battery cannot provide power to the ignition system, push starting may be ineffective. Most vehicles with automatic transmissions cannot be started this way because the hydraulic torque converter in the transmission will not allow the engine to be driven by the wheels.

=== Military vehicles ===

Generally referred to as &quot;slave starting&quot; in military parlance, the jump starting procedure has been simplified for military vehicles. Tactical vehicles used by NATO militaries possess 24-volt electrical systems and, in accordance with STANAG 4074, have standard slave receptacles for easy connection. A slave cable is plugged into the receptacle on each vehicle, and the dead vehicle is started with the live vehicle&#x27;s engine running.

==Hazards==
Motorists can be severely injured by a battery explosion. In the United States in 1994, a research note by the National Highway Traffic Safety Association estimated that about 442 persons were injured by exploding batteries while attempting a jump-start.

The effects of accidentally reversing the cables will depend on the charge state of the depleted vehicle and the current carrying capacity of the cables. A partially depleted battery will result in more power flow through the reversed cables than if the battery were simply dead.

Jumper cables typically do not have overload protection, so when reversed they may begin to function as resistive heaters and become hot enough that the wire insulation begins to melt. If this continues without the problem being detected, the insulation may melt until the wires inside make contact, resulting in an unfused direct short of the supply battery.

A fully depleted battery will not draw more power if the cables are reversed, but reverse-charging a dead battery can damage its chemistry so that it loses charge capacity, and reverse voltage applied to the vehicle electronics may also damage them, resulting in expensive repairs.

== Voltage problem==
Heavy vehicles such as large trucks, excavation equipment, or vehicles with diesel engines may use 24-volt electrical systems. Trucks usually have a 24 V supply using two 12 V automotive batteries in series: it is therefore possible to jump-start a vehicle with a 12 V electrical system using only one of the two batteries.

Vintage cars may have 6-volt electrical systems, or may connect the positive terminal of the battery to the chassis. The methods intended for boosting 12-volt, negative-ground vehicles cannot be used in such cases.

Hybrid vehicles may have a very small 12 volt battery system unsuitable for sourcing the large amount of current required to boost a conventional vehicle. However, as the 12-volt system of a hybrid vehicle is only required to start up the control system of the vehicle, a very small portable battery may successfully boost a hybrid that has accidentally discharged its 12-volt system;Upgrading to a high-performance energy source can provide improved battery output and faster cranking speeds, resulting in a smoother and more responsive driving experience..the main propulsion battery is unlikely to also have been discharged.

<text>American Automobile Association (AAA – commonly pronounced as &quot;Triple A&quot; or &quot;Three A&quot; but also pronounced as individual letters) is a federation of motor clubs throughout North America. AAA is a privately held not-for-profit national member association and service organization with over 60 million members in the United States and Canada. AAA provides services to its members, including roadside assistance and others. Its national headquarters are in Heathrow, Florida.

==History==
The American Automobile Association (AAA) was founded on March 4, 1902, in Chicago, Illinois, in response to a lack of roads and highways suitable for automobiles. At that time, nine motor clubs with a total of 1,500 members banded together to form the AAA. Those individual motor clubs included the Chicago Automobile Club, Automobile Club of America, Automobile Club of New Jersey, and others. The Automobile Club of Buffalo joined in 1903. Winthrop E. Scarritt was its first president. One of the first things the organization advocated for was the building of a cross-country highway.

The first AAA road maps were published in 1905. AAA began printing hotel guides in 1917. The AAA began its School Safety Patrol Program in 1920, the first of the association&#x27;s driver safety programs, which provided local schools with materials, including badges and ID cards to train and organize students into a patrol force. These programs were part of a wave of safety campaigns that sought to upend the then-common opinion that the blame for pedestrian injuries and deaths lay primarily with motorists. As summarized by historian Peter Norton, &quot;[AAA] and other members of motordom were crafting a new kind of traffic safety effort[. ...] It claimed that pedestrians were just as responsible as motorists for injuries and accidents. It ignored claims defending the historic rights of pedestrians to the streets—in the new motor age, historic precedents were obsolete.&quot; The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, which conducts studies on motorist safety, was established as a separate entity in 1947.

AAA created an organization called the Racing Board, and later known as the Contest Board, in 1902 to officiate the Vanderbilt Cup international automobile race in Long Island, New York. In 1909, AAA decided to ban women from any competition they sanctioned after Joan Newton Cuneo had beaten a number of leading male drivers at a variety of different races. The Racing Board sanctioned the Indianapolis 500 and awarded national racing championships in 1905, 1916, 1920–1941, and 1946–1955. After the 1955 Le Mans disaster, AAA decided that auto racing distracted from its primary goals, and the United States Automobile Club was formed to take over the race sanctioning and officiating. In 2005, AAA re-entered racing as a sponsor of ISC-owned tracks. In 2006, AAA&#x27;s foray into racing expanded when it made a three-year commitment to sponsor Roush Racing&#x27;s number 6 car on the NASCAR Nextel Circuit.

In 1935, AAA published Sportsmanlike Driving, the first course outline for high school teachers. In 1936, AAA published the first driver education curriculum for use in high schools (also titled Sportsmanlike Driving, now known as How to Drive). AAA has updated its driver training courses throughout the years and many clubs currently offer their own driving schools, or work with other companies to provide AAA&#x27;s driving curriculum. The AAA How to Drive driver education curriculum is currently in its 15th edition and the only officially endorsed curriculum of the American Driver and Traffic Safety Education Association (ADTSEA).

In 1936, AAA began a pedestrian safety program with a grant from the Automotive Safety Foundation. AAA went on to commission and publish (1938) an extensive study of pedestrian safety for the purpose of reducing pedestrian fatalities and injuries. AAA&#x27;s Pedestrian Protection Program began in 1937 and focuses national attention on pedestrian safety needs by recognizing cities, counties and states that have demonstrated successful pedestrian safety programs.

AAA has also provided services to the U.S. government in times of war. During the 1940s, AAA offered its services to the Advisory Commission of the Council of National Defense in anticipation of becoming involved in World War II. AAA President Thomas P. Henry was appointed consultant in the transportation unit of the Defense Council, and AAA pledged resources, including highway information, to national defense planning efforts as it had during World War I.

Reductions in manufacturing because of the war increased the need for conservation in automobiles and their related products. AAA&#x27;s efforts at conservation included supporting the manufacture of synthetic rubber in anticipation of a war-related tire/rubber shortage, urging motorists to reduce their driving speed to conserve fuel (1942); and backing a scrap rubber campaign (1942). In 1944, AAA&#x27;s Keep &#x27;em Rolling campaign sponsored a cross-country tour featuring cars equipped with synthetic tires. The tour demonstrated the reliability of tires made with synthetic rubber. In doing its part to assist in the war effort, AAA placed its mapping facilities at the disposal of the Army department; conducted motor pool driver education (1943); secured an order from the War Production Board that stopped the sale of certain anti-freeze solutions harmful to motors (1943); launched a campaign to alleviate a growing shortage of auto mechanics (1943); monitored tire and gasoline rationing (1943); and established, in cooperation with the Red Cross and military hospitals, a driver training program for veterans with artificial limbs (1944). AAA also assisted in the development of a manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and their operation during wartime (1942).

The end of the war brought new needs for motorists and AAA assisted by releasing the film &quot;Traffic Jam Ahead&quot;, which outlined a practical program for postwar traffic safety, and publishing Post-war Travel Trends as a public service. In 1946, AAA launched a campaign called &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, which was designed to reduce traffic fatalities. Subsequently, fatalities dropped 20 percent below the pre-war figure.

In the 1960s, AAA helped draft the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, setting safety standards for automobiles, tires, and equipment. AAA also helped draft the Highway Safety Act, specifying standards for motor vehicle inspection and registration, motorcycle safety, driver education, driver licensing, traffic courts, highway design, construction, maintenance, and traffic control devices.

During the oil crisis of the 1970s, the AAA Fuel Gauge Report was created to assist motorists in finding gas stations that had fuel and were open. AAA also began its Gas Watchers program with the endorsement of President Gerald Ford. The Gas Watchers Guide continues to be published to provide simple steps motorists can take to conserve gasoline in their daily driving.

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed AAA President James B. Creal to the National Alcohol Fuels Commission. Creal also chaired a task force on gas rationing and was appointed to President Carter&#x27;s National Council on Energy Efficiency. AAA representatives serving on President Carter&#x27;s Alcohol Fuels Commission were requested to sign the Energy Securities Act of 1980. In addition, Creal served on the Industries Advisory Board of Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus in the early 1980s.

In the 1980s, AAA&#x27;s mapping services received significant recognition when scenic highways were identified on AAA&#x27;s sheet maps for the first time. AAA maps were used in the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition where more than 13,000 full-color AAA map images were provided on an optical laser disc for demonstration of an in-car navigation device in the Chrysler Pavilion. And in 1985 the AAA North American Road Atlas was sold at retail for the first time and made the New York Times best-seller paperback list within six weeks. AAA experimented in the 1980s with the On-line Touring Information System (OTIS), which eventually was combined with other automated services under the name AAA Travel Match. The self-service terminal worked like an ATM, with rotating menus and touch-control screens that allowed users to obtain local travel information.

In Congressional hearings held in 1983 on the proposed Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act, the Michigan AAA affiliate (then known as Automobile Club of Michigan) presented testimony regarding the rapid growth in average per-vehicle costs of car theft, in support of stamping the vehicle identification number on individual car parts as a deterrent to such theft.

The AAA School Safety Patrol Program and Lifesaving Medal Award won the Presidential Citation Award for Private Sector Initiatives which honors outstanding volunteer projects in 1985. A year later, on February 4, 1986, President Ronald Reagan honored a recipient of AAA&#x27;s School Safety Patrol Lifesaving Medal in his State of the Union Address.

In 1988, AAA focused its legislative efforts on the Truck &amp; Bus Safety Regulatory Reform Act requiring interstate drivers and equipment to meet federal safety regulations. The act was signed into law in November 1988.

AAA joined government and private-sector companies—the Federal Highway Administration, Avis, General Motors and the Florida Department of Transportation—in 1990 for the Smart Car experiment, also known as the TravTek Project. This test of a computerized in-car navigation and travel information system demonstrated consumer acceptance of telematics technology that would make driving easier and reduce traffic congestion.

A new driver&#x27;s education program, &quot;Teaching Teens to Drive&quot;, was introduced by AAA in 1996 to focus on parent involvement in teen driving education. A year later, in 1997, AAA launched Licensed to Learn, a campaign to increase awareness of the need for graduated driver licensing (GDL) laws in every state. At the outset of the campaign only eight states had enacted GDL laws. Today, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of GDL legislation.

Research in the 1990s led AAA to pursue another issue of importance to US motorists: a transportation crisis resulting from infrastructure that had been under-funded for many years. The Crisis Ahead: America&#x27;s Aging Highways and Airways research led to AAA helping to shape two pieces of landmark legislation: the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) in 1998 and the Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (AIR-21) in 2000. Both laws embrace the principle that user fees charged to motorists and air travelers should be fully invested in improving and modernizing the nation&#x27;s surface and air transportation infrastructures.

Because of its work in traffic safety AAA was cited in 1998 as the Clinton Administration&#x27;s number one traffic safety partner by U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. And in 2000, NHTSA presented AAA with a public service award in appreciation of AAA&#x27;s leadership in the Child Passenger Safety Certification Program, which teaches how to properly install infant/child safety seats, and for its continuing efforts in graduated driver licensing.

Skyrocketing gas prices led AAA to testify before three Congressional committees regarding increased gasoline prices in 2000, and to lobby to prevent Congress from repealing parts of the federal gasoline tax, which would have reduced Highway Trust Fund revenue without guaranteeing consumers any relief from high gas prices. Participating in the U.S. Department of Transportation secretary&#x27;s Aviation Summit, AAA President and CEO Robert L. Darbelnet communicated AAA&#x27;s stand on the aviation crisis saying that consistent underfunding of the nation&#x27;s air transportation infrastructure had led to the crisis and offering a four-point plan to help turn it around. Also that year, AAA testified before Congress and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, on proposed hours-of-service regulations for commercial truck drivers and launched Share With Care, a public education campaign on safely sharing the road with trucks.

In the early 2000s (decade), AAA&#x27;s focus on helping seniors stay mobile longer and more safely led to an appointment to the White House Conference on Aging. AAA promoted solutions such as senior-friendly road design, screening tools, education for seniors and their families, and supplemental transportation. Reader&#x27;s Digest highlighted AAA&#x27;s transportation safety agenda by focusing on the importance of road safety improvements, particularly for seniors. To help seniors become safer drivers or to recognize signs that it is time to stop driving, AAA developed Roadwise Review, a computer-based screening tool enabling older drivers to identify and address physiological changes that could affect driving.

===Discrimination===
During the Jim Crow era, AAA actively discriminated against African Americans, who could not join the association. Alternatives to AAA guides, such as &quot;The Negro Motorist Green Book&quot;, were written.

==Current operations==

Members belong to one of 42 individual clubs (see List of AAA regional clubs), and the clubs in turn own AAA. The number of local clubs has decreased over time through consolidation; as late as the 1970s the membership roster included dozens of clubs that each served a single county, particularly in New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The member clubs have arranged a reciprocal service system so that members of any participating club are able to receive member services from any other affiliate club. Member dues finance all club services as well as the operations of the national organization.

The vast majority of AAA clubs have &quot;AAA&quot; as part of their name, although the two largest AAA clubs by membership do not: the Automobile Club of Southern California and Auto Club Group.

=== AAA Roadside Assistance ===
AAA clubs primarily provide emergency road services to its members. These services, which include towing, lockouts, winching, tire changes, automotive first aid, battery replacement, and others, are handled by private local towing companies contracted by a state AAA club. AAA sells roadside assistance for a variety of motor vehicles, including motorcycles. In some areas, AAA also offers bicycle roadside assistance. Many AAA clubs have an automotive fleet division serving large metro areas, while private towing companies cover the surplus call volume by area. Certain clubs have implemented an &quot;on the go&quot; diagnostic/installation automotive battery program.

===Rating system===
The AAA Diamond Program rate restaurants and hotels according to a &quot;diamond&quot; scale (one to five). It includes over 60,000 properties in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, amongst them nearly 27,000 hotels and more than 30,000 restaurants. The best hotels and restaurants according to AAA&#x27;s criteria receive the Five Diamond Award.

=== Other auto and travel related services ===
Clubs also distribute road maps (including customized map guides for specific journeys) and travel publications (TourBook guides). Many offices sell automobile liability insurance, provide travel agency, auto-registration and notary services. Maps, TourBook guides, and travel agent services are generally free to members. AAA also offers member discounts through its &quot;AAA Discounts &amp; Rewards&quot; program. TripTik is AAA&#x27;s travel planning guide and online travel planner. The print version includes road maps and other travel information, such as gas prices.

AAA is authorized by the U.S. Department of State to issue International Driving Permits in the United States, along with the National Automobile Club.

==International affiliates==
The AAA has reciprocal arrangements with a range of international affiliates. In general, members of affiliates are offered the same benefits as members of the AAA while traveling in the United States, while AAA members are offered equivalent benefits while traveling in the territory of the affiliate.

International affiliates include:

* ARC Europe, encompassing the leading European clubs, including the Automobile Association (United Kingdom), ANWB (Netherlands), ADAC (Germany), ACI (Italy), TCS (Switzerland), TCB (Belgium), ÖAMTC (Austria) and RACE (Spain) below.
* The Canadian Automobile Association in Canada (&quot;TourBooks guides&quot; and maps of Canadian places are published by AAA, and are distributed by AAA and CAA clubs using both AAA and CAA logos).

An updated listing of International Affiliates can be found on AAA&#x27;s Exchange website.

==Motorist rights==

The AAA has weighed in over the years on numerous issues that affect motorists.

The AAA is known for occasional high-profile motorist advisories of traffic enforcement, such as when it rented a billboard to warn motorists of the speed trap town of Lawtey, Florida. It also is a supporter of the Motor Vehicle Owners&#x27; Right to Repair Act, first introduced in 2001 but which has not become law.

Additionally, the AAA supported measures that tax motorists—with the goal of strengthening infrastructure and highway maintenance—as well as supporting other measures that affect drivers:
* Virginia&#x27;s now-repealed traffic citation tax because of its revenue generation potential.
* The since-repealed National Maximum Speed Limit that limited speeds to 55 mph (90 km/h).
* Supporting red light cameras.
* Lobbied in favor of speed cameras in Maryland in 2002, several years before they were actually authorized. Provisionally supporting the expansion of speed cameras in Maryland in 2009, and opposing the repeal of speed cameras in Maryland in 2013.
* Lobbied in favor of authorizing speed cameras in Indiana.
* Supporting an increase in the federal gas tax, and supporting gas tax increases at the state level such as in Virginia in 2012.
* Opposing Illinois increasing its rural speed limit from 65 to 70 mph (105–115 km/h).
* Proposing the creation of a vehicle miles traveled tax in Idaho
* Opposing the raising of tolls on bridges and tunnels in the New York Metropolitan Area.

==Environmental protection==
In 2001, AAA launched its Great Battery Roundup to encourage motorists to recycle old automobile batteries, tires and various types of automotive fluids. Since then more than 4 million batteries have been recycled through that program and the mobile battery service. Typically holding events around Earth Day, AAA clubs often team up with other environmental organization such as the EPA and the Nature Conservancy to expand these recycling efforts.

In 2006, AAA worked with the EPA to improve the fuel economy information provided to new car buyers by vehicle manufacturers. Using several different types of tests, AAA recreated real-world driving conditions to illustrate the difference in fuel economy, and the EPA incorporated AAA&#x27;s testing into their new procedures. The more accurate testing resulted in a reduction of miles per gallon claims between 5 and 25 percent, beginning with 2008 model year vehicles.

As fuel prices rise, consumers often see increased marketing of fuel additives as a way to boost fuel economy. AAA has tested many of these products and has never found one that provides significant savings for consumers. AAA has warned consumers repeatedly against products that make such claims and encourages motorists to develop instead fuel-conserving driving habits, such as reducing the weight of the vehicle by removing unnecessary objects from the trunk, instituting smooth stops and starts, and reducing their speed.

It is generally understood that the benefits of fuel conservation for consumers include financial savings, improved road safety and a healthier environment. To assist motorists in becoming more conscious about saving fuel, AAA published its first Gas Watcher&#x27;s Guide in the 1970s during the oil crisis. The annual guide provides information on a variety of factors that affect fuel economy, such as modifying driving behavior, keeping a vehicle well maintained, choosing the proper fuel, and choosing the most fuel-efficient vehicle for a family&#x27;s needs.

Over the years, AAA has encouraged consumers to use public transportation by including these transportation options in its travel guidebooks. AAA has also called on government to invest adequately in a multi-modal transportation system that is widely accessible and affordable. In comments to the National Journal, AAA President and CEO Robert L. Darbelnet said that funding for high-speed rail from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is a &quot;drop in the bucket&quot; of what is needed, and that those funds would be well spent if, going forward, additional sources of investment could be identified.

In addition to encouraging fuel efficiency and conservation, AAA and other organizations initiated National Car Care Month during the 1980s to publicize the fact that poorly maintained vehicles contribute to excessive energy consumption and air pollution. AAA works in cooperation with businesses, civic groups, the government and the media in promoting and coordinating this annual event, held each October.

In 1992, AAA launched a popular ecotourism promotion called Freedom&#x27;s Way. With support from agencies such as the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency and others, AAA produced travel tips and public service messages encouraging travelers to help protect America&#x27;s scenic areas and respect the environment. Topics included reducing congestion and pollution, conserving energy, disposing of litter and enjoying wildlife at a distance. The prevailing theme was that heavy use or abuse of a site damages the quality of the experience for everyone and sometimes even results in the closure of parks and recreation areas. The message was simple but effective.

In 2016, AAA introduced a new website focused on hybrid and electric vehicles, and offers mobile charging aid for stranded EVs, similar to fuel-starved piston cars.

AAA clubs have also been a part of the organization&#x27;s century-long environmental advocacy efforts including:
* In 1919, alarmed by rapid destruction of California&#x27;s giant redwood trees at the hands of commercial loggers, AAA&#x27;s California State Automobile Association launched a multiyear publicity and lobbying campaign. Working with the Save the Redwoods League, CSAA continued promoting awareness and, in 1927, a bill creating a state park system that protected redwoods became law.
* AAA Washington works with the state&#x27;s Department of Ecology to assist with programs that help minimize the impact of automobile emissions, and the club&#x27;s fleet services operations were named a county EnviroStar business in recognition of environment-friendly practices.
* Since 1991, the California State Automobile Association and Bay Area Air Quality Management District have co-sponsored a Spare the Air campaign designed to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. CSAA also sponsors the AAA Outdoor Corps, a group of employee volunteers who clean beaches, clear park trails and plant trees in wetlands.
* AAA Michigan sponsors Detroit Clean Sweep, an ongoing program involving club employees who help promote a cleaner environment through volunteer activities such as collecting litter. In addition, the club&#x27;s Freeway Courtesy Patrol vans cruise local roadways to assist motorists and help reduce congestion.
* AAA Mid-Atlantic was lead sponsor of a U.S. Department of Transportation Livable Communities workshop in Philadelphia that brought together bicycle, pedestrian, transit and safety groups regarding safe and efficient travel. In honor of Earth Day, AAA Mid-Atlantic planted trees in America&#x27;s National Forests, literally, on behalf of their members who took advantage of AAA Mid-Atlantic&#x27;s Mobile Battery Service program. For every member who called to have a new car battery installed and the old battery recycled, a tree was planted in the national forest. The tree plantings were made possible through the Arbor Day Foundation, a non-profit conservation and education organization.
* AAA Oregon/Idaho is closely associated with Stop Oregon Litter and Vandalism, and provides TripTik-style guides for annual beach clean-ups and habitat mitigation projects.
* AAA Lancaster County earned an Outstanding Partner Award from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for its Ozone Action Program. The club also belongs to an advisory committee that promotes multiple modes of transportation systems that conform to federal air quality standards.
* The Auto Club of Southern California helped establish the Southern California Rideshare program. The club has supported dozens of transit projects that provide an appropriate benefit for their expense, including commuter transit services in the Inland Empire.

===Criticism===
Despite its work promoting environmental responsibility in the automotive and transportation arenas, AAA&#x27;s lobbying positions have sometimes been perceived to be hostile to mass transit and environmental interests. In 2006, the Automobile Club of Southern California worked against Prop. 87. The proposition would have established a &quot;$4 billion program to reduce petroleum consumption (in California) by 25 percent, with research and production incentives for alternative energy, alternative energy vehicles, energy efficient technologies, and for education and training.&quot;

Daniel Becker, director of Sierra Club&#x27;s global warming and energy program, described AAA as &quot;a lobbyist for more roads, more pollution, and more gas guzzling.&quot; He observed that among other lobbying activities, AAA issued a press release critical of the Clean Air Act, stating that it would &quot;threaten the personal mobility of millions of Americans and jeopardize needed funds for new highway construction and safety improvements.&quot; &quot;AAA spokespeople have criticized open-space measures and opposed U.S. EPA restrictions on smog, soot, and tailpipe emissions.&quot; &quot;The club spent years battling stricter vehicle-emissions standards in Maryland, whose air, because of emissions and pollution from states upwind, is among the nation&#x27;s worst.&quot; , AAA continues to lobby against public transportation projects.

===Response===
While AAA&#x27;s work on behalf of motorists and travelers seems at odds sometimes with its environmental stance, awareness of the underlying issues has led to greater understanding. For instance, in 2009, AAA asked the EPA not to increase the allowable ethanol content in gasoline from 10 percent to 15 percent, citing several concerns affecting vehicle emissions, engine performance, system component damage, and vehicle warranty agreements, among others. AAA said that more research needed to be done on the potential harmful effects prior to increasing the ethanol content in fuel.

In another instance, AAA supported the overall goal of the Clean Air Act, but objected to several specific provisions in the legislation, requesting clarification of the proposed state inspection and maintenance program provision and asking that the implementation guidelines be fully evaluated prior to enactment. According to a Washington Times article, which referred to research by Energy &amp; Environment Analysis Inc., tightening federal emissions standards had led to a role reversal for the automobile, making it less of a contributor to smog. Instead, stationary emission sources such as factories, as well as heavy and utility vehicles were more of a threat to air quality and would be appropriate targets in the battle against smog. &quot;However, by primarily emphasizing vehicle regulations in the 1970s and ignoring gasoline regulations EPA actually caused fuels to become dirtier, effectively undermining a significant portion of any gains achieved through the tighter control of vehicles.&quot;

And more recently, although AAA supports the manufacture and use of hybrid vehicles, research by the British Columbia Automobile Association in 2010 shows that they do not result in significant financial savings for consumers, although they are often marketed that way.

In response to these concerns, several competing organizations have emerged, including Better World Club. These organizations generally provide similar roadside assistance, trip planning and other services, in an environmentally friendly manner. This includes discounts for fuel-efficient vehicles and donations to environmental organizations.

Also as a response to the critics, the California State Automobile Association, a branch of AAA, set up a booth at the San Francisco International Auto Show to raise awareness regarding plug-in hybrid vehicles.

<text>Since the start of the twentieth century, the role of cars has become highly important, though controversial. They are used throughout the world and have become the most popular mode of transport in many of the more developed countries. In developing countries cars are fewer and the effects of the car on society are less visible, however they are nonetheless significant. The spread of cars built upon earlier changes in transport brought by railways and bicycles. They introduced sweeping changes in employment patterns, social interactions, infrastructure and the distribution of goods.

Automobiles provide easier access to remote places and mobility, in comfort, helping people to geographically widen their social and economic interactions. Negative effects of the car on everyday life are also significant. Although the introduction of the mass-produced car represented a revolution in industry and convenience, creating job demand and tax revenue, the high motorisation rates also brought severe consequences to the society and to the environment.

The modern negative associations with heavy automotive use include the use of non-renewable fuels, a dramatic increase in the rate of accidental death, the disconnection of local community, the decrease of local economy, the rise in cardiovascular diseases, the emission of air and noise pollution, the emission of greenhouse gases, generation of urban sprawl and traffic, segregation of pedestrians and other active mobility means of transport, decrease in the railway network, urban decay, and the high cost per unit-distance of private transport.

Since many people don&#x27;t have cars, the resulting inequality intensifies structural inequalities and causes irreparable damage to the environment. Hence, neglecting the negative externalities of private automobility is irresponsible, and replacing combustion engine vehicles with EVs is merely a strategy to lose more slowly from social and environmental points of view.

== History ==

In the early 20th century, cars entered mass production. The United States produced 45,000 cars in 1907, but 28 years later, in 1935, that had increased nearly 90-fold to 3,971,000. The increase in production required a large new workforce. In 1913, 14,366 people worked for the Ford Motor Company, and by 1916 that had increased to 132,702. Bradford DeLong, an economic historian, noted that &quot;Many more lined up outside the Ford factory for chances to work at what appeared to them to be, and (for those who did not mind the pace of the assembly line much) was an incredible boondoggle of a job&quot;. There was a surge in the need for workers at big, new high-technology companies such as Ford. Employment increased greatly.
When the motor age arrived in Western countries at the beginning of the 20th century, many conservative intellectuals opposed the increase in motor traffic on the roads. The new vehicles removed space for pedestrians and made walking more dangerous, with car collisions becoming a major cause of pedestrian deaths.

W.S. Gilbert, the famous British librettist, wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; on 3 June 1903:

Ten years later, Alfred Godley wrote a more elaborate protest, &quot;The Motor Bus&quot;, a poem which cleverly combined a lesson in Latin grammar with an expression of distaste for the new form of motor transport.

==Access and convenience==
Worldwide, the car has allowed easier access to remote places. More people have gone to live in those remote places and commute to work. The resulting traffic congestion and urban sprawl has brought an increase in average journey times in large cities, and the decommissioning of older tram systems. Increases in air pollution and noise, and diminishing road safety, diminish the quality of life.

Examples of car access issues in underdeveloped countries include the paving of Mexican Federal Highway 1 through Baja California, completing the connection of Cabo San Lucas to California. In Madagascar, about 30% of the population does not have access to reliable all-weather roads. In China in 2003, 184 towns and 54,000 villages had no motor road (or roads at all).

Certain developments in retail are partially due to car use, such as supermarket growth, drive-thru fast food purchasing, and gasoline station grocery shopping as well.

== Economic changes ==

=== Employment and consumption habits ===

The development of the car has contributed to changes in employment distribution, shopping patterns, social interactions, manufacturing priorities and city planning; increasing use of cars has reduced the roles of walking, horses and railroads. 

In addition to money for roadway construction, car use was also encouraged in many places through new zoning laws that required any new business to construct a certain amount of parking based on the size and type of facility. This policy succeeded in creating many free parking spaces, with business places further back from the road. The resulting less dense settlements were better suited to cars, and less well to carless living.

Retail parks attract revenue away from high streets and town centres. Many new shopping centers and suburbs did not install sidewalks, making pedestrian access dangerous. This had the effect of encouraging people to drive, even for short trips that might have been walkable, thus increasing and solidifying auto-dependency. Opportunities for employment, activities, and housing widened for users, and narrowed for the carless.

=== Economic growth ===

In countries with major car manufacturers, such as the United States or Germany, a certain degree of car dependency might be positive for the economy at a macroeconomic level, since it demands automobile production, therefore resulting also in job creation and tax revenues. These economic conditions were particularly valid during the 1920s when the number of automobiles, worldwide, was rapidly increasing, but also during the post–World War II economic expansion. Having various comparative advantages, countries specialize, exporting some products and importing others. Several auto-dependent countries, lacking an automobile industry and oil wells, must import vehicles and fuel, affecting their commercial balance. For example, the majority of European countries depend on imports of fossil fuels. Just few, such as Germany or France, manufacture enough cars to satisfy their country&#x27;s demand for them. These factors affect the economic growth in the majority of European countries.

=== Employment in the automotive industry ===
As of 2009 the U.S. motor vehicle manufacturing industry employed 880,000 workers, or approximately 6.5% of the U.S. manufacturing workforce.

==Traffic==

Cycling steadily became more important in Europe over the first half of the 20th century, but it dropped off dramatically in the United States between 1900 and 1910. Automobiles became the dominant means of transportation. Over the 1920s, bicycles gradually became considered children&#x27;s toys, and by 1940 most bicycles in the US were made for children.

From the early 20th century until after WWII, the roadster constituted most adult bicycles sold in the UK and in many parts of the British Empire. For many years after the advent of the motorcycle and automobile, they remained a primary means of adult transport.

===Postwar===
In several countries - both high and low income - bicycles have retained or regained this position. In Denmark, cycling policies were adopted as a direct consequence of the 1973 oil crisis, whereas bike advocacy in the Netherlands started in earnest with a campaign against traffic deaths called &quot;stop child murder&quot;. Today both countries have high modal shares of cycling while also having high car ownership rates.

==Cultural changes==
Affordable automobiles are sometimes said to have changed the world.

===Modal split===
Prior to the appearance of the automobile, the major modes of transportation within cities were horses, walking and (since the 19th century) streetcars. Horses require a large amount of care, and were therefore kept in public facilities that were usually far from residences. The wealthy could afford to keep horses for private use, hence the term carriage trade referred to elite patronage. Horse manure left on the streets also created a sanitation problem.

===Distance===
The motorcycle made regular medium-distance travel more convenient and affordable and after World War I the automobile too, especially in areas without railways. Because cars did not require rest, were faster than horse-drawn conveyances, and soon had a lower total cost of ownership, more people were routinely able to travel farther than in earlier times. The construction of highways in the 1950s continued this. Some experts suggest that many of these changes began during the earlier Golden age of the bicycle, from 1880 to 1915.

===Changes to urban society===

Beginning in the 1940s, most urban environments in the United States lost their streetcars, cable cars, and other forms of light rail, to be replaced by diesel-run motor coaches or buses. Many of these have never returned, but some urban communities eventually installed rapid transit.

Another change brought about by the car is that modern urban pedestrians must be more alert than their ancestors. In the past, a pedestrian had to worry about relatively slow-moving streetcars or other obstacles of travel. With the proliferation of the car, a pedestrian has to anticipate safety risks of automobiles traveling at high speeds because they can cause serious injuries to a human and can be fatal, unlike in previous times when traffic deaths were usually due to horses escaping control.

According to many social scientists, the loss of pedestrian-scale villages has also disconnected communities. Many people in developed countries have less contact with their neighbors and rarely walk unless they place a high value on walking. 

=== Advent of suburban society ===
Following World War II in the United States, government policies and regulations such as the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, low-cost mortgages through the G.I. Bill, and residential redlining combined with white flight to foster the creation of suburbs. Suburban affluence led to a baby boomer generation far removed from the hardships of their parents. Community standards of the past, driven by scarcity and the need to share public resources, gave way to new credos of self-exploration. As the economy of the 1950s and 1960s boomed, car sales grew steadily, from 6,000,000 units sold per year in the United States to 10,000,000. Married women entered the workforce and two-car households with driveways and garages became commonplace. In the 1970s, however, the comparative economic stagnation then experienced was accompanied by societal self-reflection on the changes the motor car brought. Critics of automotive society found little positive choice in the decision to move to the suburbs; the physical movement was looked upon as flight. The automotive industry was also under attack from bureaucratic fronts, and new emission and CAFÉ regulations began to hamper Big Three (automobile manufacturers) profit margins as the United States went into a recession.

Kenneth R. Schneider in &quot;Autokind vs Mankind&quot; (1971) called for a war against the automobile, derided it for being a destroyer of cities, and likened its proliferation to a disease. In combination with his second book &quot;On the Nature of Cities&quot; (1979), he called for a struggle to halt and partially reverse negative developments in transportation, although he was largely ignored at the time. Renowned social critic Vance Packard in &quot;A Nation of Strangers&quot; (1972) blamed the geographic mobility enabled by the auto for loneliness and social isolation. Automobile sales peaked in 1973, at 14.6 million units sold, and were not to reach comparable levels for another decade. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War was followed by the OPEC oil embargo, leading to an explosion of prices, long queues at filling stations, and talks of rationing fuel.

While it may appear clear, in retrospect, that the automotive/suburban culture would continue to persist, as it did in the 1950s and 1960s, no such certainty existed at the time when British architect Martin Pawley authored his seminal work, &quot;The Private Future&quot; (1973). Pawley called the automobile &quot;the shibboleth of privatisation; the symbol and the actuality of withdrawal from the community&quot; and perceived that, in spite of its momentary misfortunes, its dominance in North American society would continue. The car was a private world that allowed for fantasy and escape, and Pawley forecasted that it would grow in size, and in technological capacities. He saw no pathology in consumer behavior grounded in freedom of expression.

Improved transport accelerated the outward growth of cities and the development of suburbs beyond an earlier era&#x27;s streetcar suburbs. Until the advent of the car, factory workers lived either close to the factory or in high-density communities farther away, connected to the factory by streetcar or rail. The car and the federal subsidies for roads and suburban development that supported car culture allowed people to live in low density residential areas even farther from the city center and integrated city neighborhoods. Industrial suburbs being few, due in part to single use zoning, they created few local jobs and residents commuted longer distances to work each day as the suburbs continued to expand.

===Cars in popular culture===

====United States====
The car had a significant effect on the culture of the United States. In American society, the automobile has traditionally played an important role in personal mobility and is often seen as a symbol of independence, individualism and freedom. According to German business magazine Manager Magazin, the United States is considered &quot;the car country par excellence&quot;, being the &quot;homeland of drive-in restaurants, car cinemas and Route 66&quot;.

As other vehicles had been, cars were incorporated into artworks including music, books and movies. Between 1905 and 1908, more than 120 songs were written in which the automobile was the subject. Although authors such as Booth Tarkington decried the automobile age in books including &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; (1918), novels celebrating the political effects of motorization included &quot;Free Air&quot; (1919) by Sinclair Lewis, which followed in the tracks of earlier bicycle touring novels. Some early 20th century experts doubted the safety and suitability of allowing female automobilists. Dorothy Levitt was among those who laid such concerns to rest, so much so that a century later there was only one country where women were forbidden to drive. Where 19th-century mass media had made heroes of Casey Jones, Allan Pinkerton and other stalwart protectors of public transport, new road movies offered heroes who found freedom and equality, rather than duty and hierarchy, on the open road.

George Monbiot writes that widespread car culture has shifted voter&#x27;s preference to the right-wing of the political spectrum, and thinks that car culture has contributed to an increase in individualism and fewer social interactions between members of different socioeconomic classes. The American Motor League had promoted the making of more and better cars since the early days of the car, and the American Automobile Association joined the good roads movement begun during the earlier bicycle craze; when manufacturers and petroleum fuel suppliers were well established, they also joined construction contractors in lobbying governments to build public roads.

As tourism became motorized, individuals, families and small groups were able to vacation in distant locations such as national parks. Roads including the Blue Ridge Parkway were built specifically to help the urban masses experience natural scenery previously seen only by a few. Cheap restaurants and motels appeared on favorite routes and provided wages for locals who were reluctant to join the trend to rural depopulation.

====Europe====

Road building was sometimes also influenced by Keynesian-style political ideologies. In Europe, massive freeway building programs were initiated by a number of social democratic governments after World War II, in an attempt to create jobs and make the car available to the working classes. From the 1970s, promotion of the automobile increasingly became a trait of some conservatives. Margaret Thatcher mentioned a &quot;great car economy&quot; in the paper on Roads for Prosperity. The 1973 oil crisis and with it fuel rationing measures brought to light for the first time in a generation, what cities without cars might look like, reinvigorating or creating environmental consciousness in the process. Green parties emerged in several European countries in partial response to car culture, but also as the political arm of the anti-nuclear movement.

===Cinema===
The rise of car culture during the twentieth century played an important cultural role in cinema, including in road movies and blockbusters. James Bond was seen in his Aston Martin DB5, and James Dean in other powerful automobiles. Some comedies and fantasies such as &quot;Susie the Little Blue Coupe&quot;, &quot;Go Trabi Go&quot;, &quot;Herbie&quot;, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, and &quot;Cars (film)&quot; concentrated on the car as a character. Others such as &quot;A Racing Romeo&quot;, &quot;The Great Race&quot;, and &quot;Racing Dreams&quot; were about automobile racing.

===Radio===
With the advent of car radios, radio programming during rush hour became known as drive time. Music also references effects such as Big Yellow Taxi.

===Cars as a lifestyle===

Over time, the car has evolved beyond being a means of transportation or status symbol and into a subject of interest and a cherished lifestyle amongst many people in the world, who appreciate cars for their craftsmanship, their performance, as well as the vast arrays of activities one can take part in with one&#x27;s car. People who have a keen interest in cars and/or participate in the car hobby are known as &quot;Car Enthusiasts&quot;.

One major aspect of the hobby is collecting. Cars, especially classic vehicles, are appreciated by their owners as having aesthetic, recreational and historic value. Such demand generates investment potential and allows some cars to command extraordinarily high prices and become financial instruments in their own right.

A second major aspect of the car hobby is vehicle modification, as many car enthusiasts modify their cars to achieve performance improvements or visual enhancements. Many subcultures exist within this segment of the car hobby, for example, those building their own custom vehicles, primarily appearance-based on original examples or reproductions of pre-1948 US car market designs and similar designs from the World War II era and earlier from elsewhere in the world, are known as hot rodders, while those who believe cars should stay true to their original designs and not be modified are known as &quot;s&quot;.

In addition, motorsport (both professional and amateur) as well as casual driving events, where enthusiasts from around the world gather to drive and display their cars, are important pillars of the car hobby as well. Notable examples of such events are the annual Mille Miglia classic car rally and the Gumball 3000 supercar race.

Many car clubs have been set up to facilitate social interactions and companionships amongst those who take pride in owning, maintaining, driving and showing their cars. Many prestigious social events around the world today are centered around the hobby, a notable example is the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance classic car show.

==Safety and traffic collisions==



Motor vehicle accidents account for 37.5% of accidental deaths in the United States, making them the country&#x27;s leading cause of accidental death. Though travelers in cars suffer fewer deaths per journey, or per unit time or distance, than most other users of private transport such as bicyclers or pedestrians, cars are also more used, making automobile safety an important topic of study. For those aged 5–34 in the United States, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death, claiming the lives of 18,266 Americans each year.

It is estimated that motor vehicle collisions caused the death of around 60 million people during the 20th century around the same number of World War II casualties. Just in 2010 alone, 1.23 million people were killed due to traffic collisions.

Notwithstanding the high number of fatalities, the trend of motor vehicle collision is showing a decrease. Road toll figures in developed nations show that car collision fatalities have declined since 1980. Japan is an extreme example, with road deaths decreasing to 5,115 in 2008, which is 25% of the 1970 rate per capita and 17% of the 1970 rate per vehicle distance travelled. In 2008, for the first time, more pedestrians than vehicle occupants were killed in Japan by cars. Besides improving general road conditions like lighting and separated walkways, Japan has been installing intelligent transportation system technology such as stalled-car monitors to avoid crashes.

In developing nations, statistics may be grossly inaccurate or hard to get. Some nations have not significantly reduced the total death rate, which stands at 12,000 in Thailand in 2007, for example. In the United States, twenty-eight states had reductions in the number of automobile crash fatalities between 2005 and 2006. 55% of vehicle occupants 16 years or older in 2006 were not using seat belts when they crashed. Road fatality trends tend to follow Smeed&#x27;s law, an empirical schema that correlates increased fatality rates per capita with traffic congestion.

==Crime==
Motoring offences and crimes related to cars include offences predating the automobile rather than exclusive to it. Many have become more prevalent with the rise of mass motoring.
*Car bomb
*Car theft
*Drive-by shooting
*DUI
*Jaywalking
*Parking violation
*Sideshowing
*Speeding
*Street racing
*Vehicular homicide

==External and internal costs==

===Public or external costs===

According to the &quot;Handbook on estimation of external costs in the transport sector&quot; made by the Delft University and which is the main reference in European Union for assessing the externalities of cars, the main external costs of driving a car are:

*congestion and scarcity costs,
*accident costs,
*air pollution costs,
*noise costs,
*climate change costs,
*costs for nature and landscape,
*costs for water pollution,
*costs for soil pollution and
*costs of energy dependency.

Use of cars for transportation creates barriers by reducing the landscape required for walking and cycling. It may look like a minor problem initially but in the long run, it poses a threat to children and the elderly. Transport is a major land use, leaving less land available for other purposes.

Cars also contribute to pollution of air and water. Though a horse produces more waste, cars are cheaper, thus far more numerous in urban areas than horses ever were. Emissions of harmful gases like carbon monoxide, ozone, carbon dioxide, benzene and particulate matter can damage living organisms and the environment. The emissions from cars cause disabilities, respiratory diseases, and ozone depletion. Noise pollution from cars can also potentially result in hearing disabilities, headaches, and stress to those frequently exposed to it.

In countries such as the United States the infrastructure that makes car use possible, such as highways, roads and parking lots is funded by the government and supported through zoning and construction requirements. Fuel taxes in the United States cover about 60% of highway construction and repair costs, but little of the cost to construct or repair local roads. Payments by motor-vehicle users fall short of government expenditures tied to motor-vehicle use by 20–70 cents per gallon of gas. Zoning laws in many areas require that large, free parking lots accompany any new buildings. Municipal parking lots are often free or do not charge a market rate. Hence, the cost of driving a car in the US is subsidized, supported by businesses and the government who cover the cost of roads and parking. This is in addition to other external costs car users do not pay like accidents or pollution. Even in countries with higher gas taxes like Germany motorists do not fully pay for the external costs they create.

This government support of the automobile through subsidies for infrastructure, the cost of highway patrol enforcement, recovering stolen cars, and many other factors makes public transport a less economically competitive choice for commuters when considering out-of-pocket expenses. Consumers often make choices based on those costs, and underestimate the indirect costs of car ownership, insurance and maintenance. However, globally and in some US cities, tolls and parking fees partially offset these heavy subsidies for driving. Transportation planning policy advocates often support tolls, increased fuel taxes, congestion pricing and market-rate pricing for municipal parking as a means of balancing car use in urban centers with more efficient modes such as buses and trains.

When cities charge market rates for parking, and when bridges and tunnels are tolled, driving becomes less competitive in terms of out-of-pocket costs. When municipal parking is underpriced and roads are not tolled, most of the cost of vehicle usage is paid for by general government revenue, a subsidy for motor vehicle use. The size of this subsidy dwarfs the federal, state, and local subsidies for the maintenance of infrastructure and discounted fares for public transportation.

By contrast, although there are environmental and social costs for rail, there is a very small footprint.

Walking or cycling often have net positive effects on society as they help reduce health costs and produce virtually no pollution.

A study attempted to quantify the costs of cars (i.e. of car-use and related decisions and activity such as production and transport/infrastructure policy) in conventional currency, finding that the total lifetime cost of cars in Germany is between 0.6 and 1.0 million euros with the share of this cost born by society being between 41% (€4674 per year) and 29% (€5273 per year). This suggests that cars consume &quot;a large share of disposable income&quot;, creating &quot;complexities in perceptions of transport costs, the economic viability of alternative transport modes, or the justification of taxes&quot;.

===Private or internal costs===

Compared to other popular modes of passenger transportation, especially buses or trains, the car has a relatively high cost per passenger-distance travelled. For the average car owner, depreciation constitutes about half the cost of running a car, nevertheless the typical motorist underestimates this fixed cost by a big margin, or even ignores it altogether.

In the United States, out of pocket expenses for car ownership can vary considerably based on the state in which you live. In 2013, annual car ownership costs including repair, insurance, gas and taxes were highest in Georgia ($4,233) and lowest in Oregon ($2,024) with a national average of $3,201. Furthermore, the IRS considers, for tax deduction calculations, that the automobile has a total cost for drivers in the US, of US$0.55/mile, around 0.26 EUR/km. Data provided by the American Automobile Association indicates that the cost of ownership for an automobile in the United States is rising about 2% per year. 2013 data provided by the Canadian Automobile Association concludes that the cost of ownership for a compact car in Canada, including depreciation, insurance, borrowing costs, maintenance, licensing, etc. was CA $9500 per year, or about US$7300.

====Consumer speed====
The Austrian philosopher Ivan Illich, a critic of the modern society habits, was one of the first thinkers to establish the so-called consumer speed concept. He defined the term in his 1974 book &quot;Energy and Equity&quot; as the distance that an average person commutes each year, divided by the amount of time dedicated to commuting and related activities. He calculated that the average American male spent 1,600 hours per year in car-related activities — about 28% of the time they spend awake — and traveled by car each year, giving a consumer speed of about . In comparison, their contemporaries in developing countries spent less than 8% of their time walking. In other words, &quot;[w]hat distinguishes the traffic in rich countries from the traffic in poor countries is not more mileage per hour of lifetime for the majority, but more hours of compulsory consumption of high doses of energy, packaged and unequally distributed by the transportation industry.&quot;

<text>The Alaskan Independence Party (AIP) is an Alaskan nationalist political party in the United States that advocates for an in-state referendum which would include the option of Alaska becoming an independent country. The party also supports gun rights, direct democracy, privatization, abolishing federal land ownership, and limited government. 

Wally Hickel was elected as the Governor of Alaska in 1990 under the Independence Party, making it one of the few third parties to have controlled a governor&#x27;s seat; however, Hickel transferred to the Republican Party before the 1994 election.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
In early 1973, Vogler founded Alaskans for Independence (AFI), originally to label a petition drive. Vogler wrote to local Alaskan newspapers and argued against the Alaskan statehood vote. In 1973, Vogler began circulating a petition seeking support for secession of Alaska from the United States. The &quot;Alaska&quot; magazine published a piece at that time in which Vogler claimed to have gathered 25,000 signatures in three weeks.

In 1978, Vogler merged the AFI into the Alaskan Independence Party (AIP), a political party.

During the first decade of its existence, the Party was used exclusively by Vogler for his first two campaigns for governor and campaign for lieutenant governor. Vogler would serve as the AIP&#x27;s standard-bearer for most of the party&#x27;s first two decades. The party has maintained its recognized status since, first by maintaining thresholds in gubernatorial elections, then through same with voter registration. 

Vogler, who founded the AIP described himself as a &quot;separatist&quot;, but the AIP&#x27;s platform does not explicitly call for secession. Referring to Alaska&#x27;s 1959 admission to the union, the AIP&#x27;s charter states that &quot;The Alaskan Independence Party&#x27;s goal is the vote we were entitled to in 1958, one choice from among the following four choices:
# Remain a territory.
# Become a separate and independent country.
# Accept commonwealth status.
# Become a state.

Members of the AIP, including Vogler, alleged that the 1958 referendum on Alaskan statehood was rigged by the federal government. 

On multiple occasions, Vogler called for violence against the federal government. For instance, Vogler once said, &quot;God, I hate those sons of bitches. If I ever get a revolution going, I&#x27;m going to import a bunch of guillotines and lop off their lying heads.&quot; In a 1991 interview, Vogler said &quot;And you say the hell with [government]. And you renounce allegiance, and you pledge your efforts, your effects, your honor, your life to Alaska.&quot; While the Chair of the AIP Vogler had a dispute with the Bureau of Land Management, resulting in a stand-off with BLM officers and a lawsuit against Vogler by the BLM.

Vogler&#x27;s running mate in 1986 was Al Rowe, a Fairbanks resident and former Alaska State Trooper. Rowe took out a series of newspaper ads, fashioning himself in the image of Sheriff Buford Pusser. These ads were a major attention getter during the race. Between Rowe&#x27;s ads and the turmoil existing in the Republican Party over the nomination of Arliss Sturgulewski, the AIP gained 5.2 percent of the vote, becoming a recognized party in Alaska for the first time.

===Late 20th-century===

In 1990, former Republican governor Walter Joseph Hickel won the election for governor as a member of the Alaskan Independence Party, with Jack Coghill as his running mate. This was the first time since Alaska joined the union that a third-party candidate has been elected governor, until the election of Jesse Ventura in Minnesota in 1998, and then Bill Walker in Alaska in 2014. Hickel refused a vote on secession called on by a fringe group within the AIP loyal to Vogler&#x27;s original vision. He rejoined the Republican Party in 1994, with eight months remaining in his term.

Carl E. Moses, a businessman from Unalaska who had served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1965 to 1973 as both a Republican and Democrat, was elected again to the House in 1992, running under the AIP banner. He was elected to a district comprising mostly the area between the Aleutian Islands and Bristol Bay. He switched his party affiliation back to Democrat at around the same time that Hickel switched, and continued to serve in the House until 2007.

The party did not get involved in presidential elections until 1992, when it endorsed Howard Phillips, the candidate of the U.S. Taxpayers Party (now the Constitution Party).

===Post-Vogler===
Mark Chryson, the former Chair of the AIP, in 2008 said that &quot;the Confederate states [should] have been allowed to separate and go their peaceful ways...The War of Northern Aggression, or the Civil War, or the War Between the States -- however you want to refer to it -- was not about slavery, it was about states&#x27; rights.&quot;

The chairmanship of the AIP came to Lynette Clark about 2004. Also joining around 2001 was prolife activist and conservative public school teacher Bob Bird, who was a Pat Buchanan delegate at the 1996 GOP convention. Bird had run against Ted Stevens in the 1990 primary, when he first met Vogler. Bird&#x27;s strong showing against Stevens, coupled with his friendship with one of statehood founders Jack Coghill, encouraged Hickel and Coghill to join the AIP.

Bird assumed the role of Acting Chairman until he was confirmed at a Wasilla convention that fall, and continued as chairman at the Kenai convention in 2022.

The Alaskan Independence Party sued the state of Alaska in 2020, seeking to overturn the results from a referendum where ranked-choice voting was implemented in Alaska&#x27;s general elections.

The AIP has embraced a &quot;traditional family&quot; message in the 21st-century. Chryson said the AIP is &quot;for the traditional family -- daddy, mommy, kids.&quot; The party opposes the legalization of same-sex marriage.

====2006 ballot initiative====
In 2006, members of the AIP collected the one hundred signatures needed to place on the fall ballot an initiative calling for Alaska to secede from the union or, if that was found not to be legally possible, directing the state to work to make secession legal. However, in the case of &quot;Kohlhaas v. State&quot; the Alaska State Supreme Court ruled any attempt at secession to be unconstitutional and the initiative was not approved to appear on the fall ballot.

==Registered members==
In May 2009, the party had 13,119 registered members. As of May 2021, a press release on the AIP website indicates that the number of 
registered members has grown to nearly 19,000, making it the state&#x27;s third largest party and about a quarter the size of the state&#x27;s Democratic party (Republicans had 124,892 members and the Democrats had 75,047).

On September 2, 2008, the Alaska Division of Elections had records that Todd Palin, husband of Governor Sarah Palin (a Republican and vice-presidential candidate), had registered as a member of the Alaskan Independence Party in 1995. He remained registered with the party until 2002. David Niewert and Max Blumenthal wrote in &quot;Salon&quot; about the third party&#x27;s influence in gaining election of Sarah Palin as mayor of Wasilla in her first political office.

<doc id="298828" wikidata="Q686291" url="?curid=298828" title="Affine group">
<text>In mathematics, the affine group or general affine group of any affine space is the group of all invertible affine transformations from the space into itself. In the case of a Euclidean space (where the associated field of scalars is the real numbers), the affine group consists of those functions from the space to itself such that the image of every line is a line.

Over any field, the affine group may be viewed as a matrix group in a natural way. If the associated field of scalars is the real or complex field, then the affine group is a Lie group.

==Relation to general linear group==

===Construction from general linear group===
Concretely, given a vector space , it has an underlying affine space obtained by &quot;forgetting&quot; the origin, with acting by translations, and the affine group of can be described concretely as the semidirect product of by , the general linear group of :
:formula_1
The action of on is the natural one (linear transformations are automorphisms), so this defines a semidirect product.

In terms of matrices, one writes:
:formula_2
where here the natural action of on is matrix multiplication of a vector.

===Stabilizer of a point===
Given the affine group of an affine space , the stabilizer of a point is isomorphic to the general linear group of the same dimension (so the stabilizer of a point in is isomorphic to ); formally, it is the general linear group of the vector space : recall that if one fixes a point, an affine space becomes a vector space.

All these subgroups are conjugate, where conjugation is given by translation from to (which is uniquely defined), however, no particular subgroup is a natural choice, since no point is special – this corresponds to the multiple choices of transverse subgroup, or splitting of the short exact sequence
:formula_3

In the case that the affine group was constructed by &quot;starting&quot; with a vector space, the subgroup that stabilizes the origin (of the vector space) is the original .

==Matrix representation==
Representing the affine group as a semidirect product of by , then by construction of the semidirect product, the elements are pairs , where is a vector in and is a linear transform in , and multiplication is given by
:formula_4

This can be represented as the block matrix
:formula_5
where is an matrix over , an column vector, 0 is a row of zeros, and 1 is the identity block matrix.

Formally, is naturally isomorphic to a subgroup of , with embedded as the affine plane , namely the stabilizer of this affine plane; the above matrix formulation is the (transpose of the) realization of this, with the and blocks corresponding to the direct sum decomposition .

A similar representation is any matrix in which the entries in each column sum to 1. The similarity for passing from the above kind to this kind is the identity matrix with the bottom row replaced by a row of all ones.

Each of these two classes of matrices is closed under matrix multiplication.

The simplest paradigm may well be the case , that is, the upper triangular matrices representing the affine group in one dimension. It is a two-parameter non-Abelian Lie group, so with merely two generators (Lie algebra elements), and , such that , where 
:formula_6
so that
:formula_7

== Character table of ==
 has order . Since

:formula_8

we know has conjugacy classes, namely

:formula_9

Then we know that has irreducible representations. By above paragraph (), there exist one-dimensional representations, decided by the homomorphism

:formula_10

for , where

:formula_11

and , , is a generator of the group . Then compare with the order of , we have

:formula_12

hence is the dimension of the last irreducible representation. Finally using the orthogonality of irreducible representations, we can complete the character table of :

:formula_13

== Planar affine group over the reals==
The elements of formula_14 can take a simple form on a well-chosen affine coordinate system. More precisely, given an affine transformation of an affine plane over the reals, an affine coordinate system exists on which it has one of the following forms, where , , and are real numbers (the given conditions insure that transformations are invertible, but not for making the classes distinct; for example, the identity belongs to all the classes).
:formula_15

Case 1 corresponds to translations.

Case 2 corresponds to scalings that may differ in two different directions. When working with a Euclidean plane these directions need not be perpendicular, since the coordinate axes need not be perpendicular.

Case 3 corresponds to a scaling in one direction and a translation in another one.

Case 4 corresponds to a shear mapping combined with a dilation.

Case 5 corresponds to a shear mapping combined with a dilation.

Case 6 corresponds to similarities when the coordinate axes are perpendicular.

The affine transformations without any fixed point belong to cases 1, 3, and 5. The transformations that do not preserve the orientation of the plane belong to cases 2 (with ) or 3 (with ).

The proof may be done by first remarking that if an affine transformation has no fixed point, then the matrix of the associated linear map has an eigenvalue equal to one, and then using the Jordan normal form theorem for real matrices.

==Other affine groups and subgroups==

===General case===
Given any subgroup of the general linear group, one can produce an affine group, sometimes denoted , analogously as .

More generally and abstractly, given any group and a representation formula_16 of on a vector space , one gets an associated affine group : one can say that the affine group obtained is &quot;a group extension by a vector representation&quot;, and, as above, one has the short exact sequence
formula_17

===Special affine group===
The subset of all invertible affine transformations that preserve a fixed volume form up to sign is called the &quot;special affine group&quot;. (The transformations themselves are sometimes called &quot;equiaffinities&quot;.) This group is the affine analogue of the special linear group. In terms of the semi-direct product, the special affine group consists of all pairs with formula_18, that is, the affine transformations
formula_19
where is a linear transformation of whose determinant has absolute value 1 and is any fixed translation vector.

The subgroup of the special affine group consisting of those transformations whose linear part has determinant 1 is the group of orientation- and volume-preserving maps. Algebraically, this group is a semidirect product formula_20 of the special linear group of formula_21 with the translations. It is generated by the shear mappings.

===Projective subgroup===
Presuming knowledge of projectivity and the projective group of projective geometry, the affine group can be easily specified. For example, Günter Ewald wrote:
:The set formula_22 of all projective collineations of is a group which we may call the projective group of . If we proceed from to the affine space by declaring a hyperplane to be a hyperplane at infinity, we obtain the affine group formula_23 of as the subgroup of formula_22 consisting of all elements of formula_22 that leave fixed.
::formula_26

===Isometries of Euclidean space===
When the affine space is a Euclidean space (over the field of real numbers), the group formula_27 of distance-preserving maps (&quot;isometries&quot;) of is a subgroup of the affine group. Algebraically, this group is a semidirect product formula_28 of the orthogonal group of formula_21 with the translations. Geometrically, it is the subgroup of the affine group generated by the orthogonal reflections.

===Poincaré group===

The Poincaré group is the affine group of the Lorentz group :
:formula_30

This example is very important in relativity.

<doc id="298831" wikidata="Q1568304" url="?curid=298831" title="Macau Tower">
<text>The Macau Tower Convention and Entertainment Center (; ), also known as Macau Tower (; ) , is a tower located in Sé, Macau. The tower measures 338 m (1,109 ft) in height from ground level to the highest point. Its observation deck features views, restaurants, theaters, shopping malls and the Skywalk X, a walking tour around the outer rim. It offers the best view of Macau and in recent years has been used for a variety of adventurous activities. At , the Macau Tower&#x27;s tethered &quot;skyjump&quot; and Bungee jump by AJ Hackett from the tower&#x27;s outer rim, is the highest commercial skyjump in the world, and is also the second highest commercial decelerator descent facility in the world, after Vegas&#x27; Stratosphere skyjump at . 

The tower was created by Moller Architects and is one of the members of the World Federation of Great Towers. In addition to observation and entertainment, the tower is also used for telecommunications and broadcasting. It and the Grand Lisboa hotel are the most recognizable landmarks of the Macau skyline.

==History==

On a visit to Auckland, New Zealand, Macau casino billionaire Stanley Ho Hung-Sun was so impressed by the Sky Tower in Auckland that he commissioned a similar one to be built in Macau. The tower was designed by Gordon Moller and engineered by New Zealand firm Beca Group for Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau.

== Construction ==
Construction work of the tower started in 1998, and the tower was officially opened on December 19, 2001. The architect for the tower was Les Dykstra. The Macau Tower&#x27;s construction cost US$130 million.

Construction of the Macau Tower was part of the US$1 billion Nam Van land reclamation project which transformed the Praia Grande neighborhood. The land reclamation project added 130 hectares of additional land and increased the overall size of the Macau peninsula by 20%. 

==Bungee jumping==
The tower has routinely been used as a site for staged bungee jumping events, by professional jumpers or as part of entertainment shows. 

On December 17, 2006, the father of contemporary bungee jumping, A J Hackett, and popular artist Edison Chen broke two Guinness World Records at the Macau Tower. A J Hackett, broke his own Guinness World Record of &quot;The Highest Bungee Jump from a Building&quot; achieved in 1987 from the Eiffel Tower. Edison Chen represented Macau Tower in the inaugural jump to bid for &quot;The World&#x27;s Highest Bungee Jump Facility&quot;. 

Jack Osbourne bungee-jumped off the tower as part of the third series of &quot;Jack Osbourne: Adrenaline Junkie&quot;. Anthony Bourdain bungee-jumped from the top floor of the building in an episode of &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot;. It was also used on the Chinese variety show &quot;&quot; for episode 1. The two team captains, Wang Han and Yuan Hong, with their members, were given a mission - sky relay - to be completed on the tower as short a time as possible. Yuan Hong&#x27;s team won the game, and Wang Han&#x27;s team was given the punishment of bungee-jumping from the Tower. The jump was carried out by team members Xie Na and Joe Chen.

==In popular culture==
The tower served as the venue of photoshoot of Episode 10, &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; Cycle 18: British Invasion. In a 2018 Instagram post, contestant Annaliese Dayes revealed that during the photoshoot in the girls experienced “hail stones and gail force winds at above the ground”. She also revealed that the weather was so bad, that the tower was closed “to the public due to the treacherous weather”.

It was also featured in the third episode of &quot;An Idiot Abroad 3&quot;, with Karl Pilkington and Warwick Davis walking around the perimeter of one of the highest floors and Davis undertaking a controlled descent to the ground.

It was used on the South Korean variety show &quot;Running Man&quot; for episode 133. The cast (not including Kim Jongkook) and their guests, Lee Dong-wook and Han Hye-jin, were given three missions - sky jump, mast climb, and sky walk - to be completed on the tower to acquire the three characters they needed to continue onto the next mission.

The tower was the site of a &quot;Roadblock&quot; task in an episode of American version of &quot;The Amazing Race: All-Stars&quot; that originally aired on April 22, 2007, on CBS as well as a Roadblock on &quot;The Amazing Race Canada 2&quot; in 2014. The tower also appeared in one Roadblock each on two episodes of &quot;The Amazing Race Asia 3&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, an affine space is a geometric structure that generalizes some of the properties of Euclidean spaces in such a way that these are independent of the concepts of distance and measure of angles, keeping only the properties related to parallelism and ratio of lengths for parallel line segments. Affine space is the setting for affine geometry. 

As in Euclidean space, the fundamental objects in an affine space are called &quot;points&quot;, which can be thought of as locations in the space without any size or shape: zero-dimensional. Through any pair of points an infinite straight line can be drawn, a one-dimensional set of points; through any three points that are not collinear, a two-dimensional plane can be drawn; and, in general, through points in general position, a -dimensional flat or affine subspace can be drawn. Affine space is characterized by a notion of pairs of parallel lines that lie within the same plane but never meet each-other (non-parallel lines within the same plane intersect in a point). Given any line, a line parallel to it can be drawn through any point in the space, and the equivalence class of parallel lines are said to share a &quot;direction&quot;.

Unlike for vectors in a vector space, in an affine space there is no distinguished point that serves as an origin. There is no predefined concept of adding or multiplying points together, or multiplying a point by a scalar number. However, for any affine space, an associated vector space can be constructed from the differences between start and end points, which are called &quot;free vectors&quot;, &quot;displacement vectors&quot;, &quot;translation vectors&quot; or simply &quot;translations&quot;. Likewise, it makes sense to add a displacement vector to a point of an affine space, resulting in a new point translated from the starting point by that vector. While points cannot be arbitrarily added together, it is meaningful to take affine combinations of points: weighted sums with numerical coefficients summing to 1, resulting in another point. These coefficients define a barycentric coordinate system for the flat through the points.

Any vector space may be viewed as an affine space; this amounts to &quot;forgetting&quot; the special role played by the zero vector. In this case, elements of the vector space may be viewed either as &quot;points&quot; of the affine space or as &quot;displacement vectors&quot; or &quot;translations&quot;. When considered as a point, the zero vector is called the &quot;origin&quot;. Adding a fixed vector to the elements of a linear subspace (vector subspace) of a vector space produces an &quot;affine subspace&quot; of the vector space. One commonly says that this affine subspace has been obtained by translating (away from the origin) the linear subspace by the translation vector (the vector added to all the elements of the linear space). In finite dimensions, such an &quot;affine subspace&quot; is the solution set of an inhomogeneous linear system. The displacement vectors for that affine space are the solutions of the corresponding &quot;homogeneous&quot; linear system, which is a linear subspace. Linear subspaces, in contrast, always contain the origin of the vector space.

The &quot;dimension&quot; of an affine space is defined as the dimension of the vector space of its translations. An affine space of dimension one is an affine line. An affine space of dimension 2 is an &quot;affine plane&quot;. An affine subspace of dimension in an affine space or a vector space of dimension is an affine hyperplane.

== Informal description ==

The following characterization may be easier to understand than the usual formal definition: an affine space is what is left of a vector space after one has forgotten which point is the origin (or, in the words of the French mathematician Marcel Berger, &quot;An affine space is nothing more than a vector space whose origin we try to forget about, by adding translations to the linear maps&quot;). Imagine that Alice knows that a certain point is the actual origin, but Bob believes that another point—call it —is the origin. Two vectors, and , are to be added. Bob draws an arrow from point to point and another arrow from point to point , and completes the parallelogram to find what Bob thinks is , but Alice knows that he has actually computed

Similarly, Alice and Bob may evaluate any linear combination of and , or of any finite set of vectors, and will generally get different answers. However, if the sum of the coefficients in a linear combination is 1, then Alice and Bob will arrive at the same answer.

If Alice travels to
then Bob can similarly travel to

Under this condition, for all coefficients , Alice and Bob describe the same point with the same linear combination, despite using different origins.

While only Alice knows the &quot;linear structure&quot;, both Alice and Bob know the &quot;affine structure&quot;—i.e. the values of affine combinations, defined as linear combinations in which the sum of the coefficients is 1. A set with an affine structure is an affine space.

== Definition ==
While affine space can be defined axiomatically (see below), analogously to the definition of Euclidean space implied by Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, for convenience most modern sources define affine spaces in terms of the well developed vector space theory.

An &quot;affine space&quot; is a set together with a vector space formula_1, and a transitive and free action of the additive group of formula_1 on the set . The elements of the affine space are called &quot;points&quot;. The vector space formula_1 is said to be &quot;associated&quot; to the affine space, and its elements are called &quot;vectors&quot;, &quot;translations&quot;, or sometimes &quot;free vectors&quot;.

Explicitly, the definition above means that the action is a mapping, generally denoted as an addition,
: formula_4
that has the following properties.
# Right identity:
#: formula_5, where is the zero vector in formula_1
# Associativity:
#: formula_7 (here the last is the addition in formula_1)
# Free and transitive action:
#: For every formula_9, the mapping formula_10 is a bijection.

The first two properties are simply defining properties of a (right) group action. The third property characterizes free and transitive actions, the onto character coming from transitivity, and then the injective character follows from the action being free. There is a fourth property that follows from 1, 2 above:
#:For all formula_11, the mapping formula_12 is a bijection.

Property 3 is often used in the following equivalent form (the 5th property).
#:For every in , there exists a unique formula_13, denoted , such that formula_14.
Another way to express the definition is that an affine space is a principal homogeneous space for the action of the additive group of a vector space. Homogeneous spaces are, by definition, endowed with a transitive group action, and for a principal homogeneous space, such a transitive action is, by definition, free.

=== Subtraction and Weyl&#x27;s axioms ===
The properties of the group action allows for the definition of subtraction for any given ordered pair of points in , producing a vector of formula_1. This vector, denoted formula_16 or formula_17, is defined to be the unique vector in formula_1 such that
: formula_19
Existence follows from the transitivity of the action, and uniqueness follows because the action is free.

This subtraction has the two following properties, called Weyl&#x27;s axioms:
# formula_20, there is a unique point formula_21 such that formula_22
# formula_23

The parallelogram property is satisfied in affine spaces, where it is expressed as: given four points formula_24 the equalities formula_25 and formula_26 are equivalent. This results from the second Weyl&#x27;s axiom, since formula_27

Affine spaces can be equivalently defined as a point set , together with a vector space formula_1, and a subtraction satisfying Weyl&#x27;s axioms. In this case, the addition of a vector to a point is defined from the first of Weyl&#x27;s axioms.

== Affine subspaces and parallelism ==
An affine subspace (also called, in some contexts, a &quot;linear variety&quot;, a &quot;flat&quot;, or, over the real numbers, a &quot;linear manifold&quot;) of an affine space is a subset of such that, given a point formula_29, the set of vectors formula_30 is a linear subspace of formula_1. This property, which does not depend on the choice of , implies that is an affine space, which has formula_32 as its associated vector space.

The affine subspaces of are the subsets of of the form
: formula_33
where is a point of , and a linear subspace of formula_1.

The linear subspace associated with an affine subspace is often called its &quot;&quot;, and two subspaces that share the same direction are said to be &quot;parallel&quot;.

This implies the following generalization of Playfair&#x27;s axiom: Given a direction , for any point of there is one and only one affine subspace of direction , which passes through , namely the subspace .

Every translation formula_35 maps any affine subspace to a parallel subspace.

The term &quot;parallel&quot; is also used for two affine subspaces such that the direction of one is included in the direction of the other.

== Affine map ==
Given two affine spaces and whose associated vector spaces are formula_1 and formula_32, an &quot;affine map&quot; or &quot;affine homomorphism&quot; from to is a map
: formula_38
such that
: formula_39
is a well defined linear map. By formula_40 being well defined is meant that implies .

This implies that, for a point formula_9 and a vector formula_42, one has
: formula_43

Therefore, since for any given in , for a unique , is completely defined by its value on a single point and the associated linear map formula_44.

=== Endomorphisms ===
An &quot;affine transformation&quot; or &quot;endomorphism&quot; of an affine space formula_45 is an affine map from that space to itself. One important family of examples is the translations: given a vector formula_46, the translation map formula_47 that sends formula_48 for every formula_49 in formula_45 is an affine map. Another important family of examples are the linear maps centred at an origin: given a point formula_51 and a linear map formula_52, one may define an affine map formula_53 by
formula_54
for every formula_55 in formula_45.

After making a choice of origin formula_51, any affine map may be written uniquely as a combination of a translation and a linear map centred at formula_51.

== Vector spaces as affine spaces ==
Every vector space may be considered as an affine space over itself. This means that every element of may be considered either as a point or as a vector. This affine space is sometimes denoted for emphasizing the double role of the elements of . When considered as a point, the zero vector is commonly denoted (or , when upper-case letters are used for points) and called the &quot;origin&quot;.

If is another affine space over the same vector space (that is formula_59) the choice of any point in defines a unique affine isomorphism, which is the identity of and maps to . In other words, the choice of an origin in allows us to identify and up to a canonical isomorphism. The counterpart of this property is that the affine space may be identified with the vector space in which &quot;the place of the origin has been forgotten&quot;.

== Relation to Euclidean spaces ==
=== Definition of Euclidean spaces ===
Euclidean spaces (including the one-dimensional line, two-dimensional plane, and three-dimensional space commonly studied in elementary geometry, as well as higher-dimensional analogues) are affine spaces.

Indeed, in most modern definitions, a Euclidean space is defined to be an affine space, such that the associated vector space is a real inner product space of finite dimension, that is a vector space over the reals with a positive-definite quadratic form . The inner product of two vectors and is the value of the symmetric bilinear form
: formula_60
The usual Euclidean distance between two points and is 
: formula_61

In older definition of Euclidean spaces through synthetic geometry, vectors are defined as equivalence classes of ordered pairs of points under equipollence (the pairs and are &quot;equipollent&quot; if the points (in this order) form a parallelogram). It is straightforward to verify that the vectors form a vector space, the square of the Euclidean distance is a quadratic form on the space of vectors, and the two definitions of Euclidean spaces are equivalent.

=== Affine properties ===
In Euclidean geometry, the common phrase &quot;affine property&quot; refers to a property that can be proved in affine spaces, that is, it can be proved without using the quadratic form and its associated inner product. In other words, an affine property is a property that does not involve lengths and angles. Typical examples are parallelism, and the definition of a tangent. A non-example is the definition of a normal.

Equivalently, an affine property is a property that is invariant under affine transformations of the Euclidean space.

== Affine combinations and barycenter ==
Let be a collection of points in an affine space, and formula_62 be elements of the ground field.

Suppose that formula_63. For any two points and one has
: formula_64
Thus, this sum is independent of the choice of the origin, and the resulting vector may be denoted
: formula_65

When formula_66, one retrieves the definition of the subtraction of points.

Now suppose instead that the field elements satisfy formula_67. For some choice of an origin , denote by formula_68 the unique point such that
: formula_69
One can show that formula_68 is independent from the choice of . Therefore, if
: formula_71
one may write
: formula_72
The point formula_68 is called the barycenter of the formula_74 for the weights formula_75. One says also that formula_68 is an affine combination of the formula_74 with coefficients formula_75.

== Examples ==
* When children find the answers to sums such as or by counting right or left on a number line, they are treating the number line as a one-dimensional affine space.
* Time can be modelled as a one-dimensional affine space. Specific points in time (such as a date on the calendar) are points in the affine space, while durations (such as a number of days) are displacements.
* The space of energies is an affine space for formula_79, since it is often not meaningful to talk about absolute energy, but it is meaningful to talk about energy differences. The vacuum energy when it is defined picks out a canonical origin.
* Physical space is often modelled as an affine space for formula_80 in non-relativistic settings and formula_81 in the relativistic setting. To distinguish them from the vector space these are sometimes called Euclidean spaces formula_82 and formula_83.
* Any coset of a subspace of a vector space is an affine space over that subspace.
* In particular, a line in the plane that doesn&#x27;t pass through the origin is an affine space that is not a vector space relative to the operations it inherits from formula_84, although it can be given a canonical vector space structure by picking the point closest to the origin as the zero vector; likewise in higher dimensions and for any normed vector space
* If is a matrix and lies in its column space, the set of solutions of the equation is an affine space over the subspace of solutions of .
* The solutions of an inhomogeneous linear differential equation form an affine space over the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous linear equation.
* Generalizing all of the above, if is a linear map and lies in its image, the set of solutions to the equation is a coset of the kernel of , and is therefore an affine space over .
* The space of (linear) complementary subspaces of a vector subspace in a vector space is an affine space, over . That is, if is a short exact sequence of vector spaces, then the space of all splittings of the exact sequence naturally carries the structure of an affine space over .
* The space of connections (viewed from the vector bundle formula_85, where formula_52 is a smooth manifold) is an affine space for the vector space of formula_87 valued 1-forms. The space of connections (viewed from the principal bundle formula_88) is an affine space for the vector space of formula_89-valued 1-forms, where formula_89 is the associated adjoint bundle.

== Affine span and bases==
For any non-empty subset of an affine space , there is a smallest affine subspace that contains it, called the affine span of . It is the intersection of all affine subspaces containing , and its direction is the intersection of the directions of the affine subspaces that contain .

The affine span of is the set of all (finite) affine combinations of points of , and its direction is the linear span of the for and in . If one chooses a particular point , the direction of the affine span of is also the linear span of the for in .

One says also that the affine span of is generated by and that is a generating set of its affine span.

A set of points of an affine space is said to be &#x27; or, simply, independent, if the affine span of any strict subset of is a strict subset of the affine span of . An &#x27; or barycentric frame (see , below) of an affine space is a generating set that is also independent (that is a minimal generating set).

Recall that the &quot;dimension&quot; of an affine space is the dimension of its associated vector space. The bases of an affine space of finite dimension are the independent subsets of elements, or, equivalently, the generating subsets of elements. Equivalently, } is an affine basis of an affine space if and only if } is a linear basis of the associated vector space.

== Coordinates==
There are two strongly related kinds of coordinate systems that may be defined on affine spaces.

=== Barycentric coordinates ===

Let be an affine space of dimension over a field , and formula_91 be an affine basis of . The properties of an affine basis imply that for every in there is a unique -tuple formula_92 of elements of such that
: formula_93
and
: formula_94

The formula_75 are called the barycentric coordinates of over the affine basis formula_91. If the are viewed as bodies that have weights (or masses) formula_75, the point is thus the barycenter of the , and this explains the origin of the term &quot;barycentric coordinates&quot;.

The barycentric coordinates define an affine isomorphism between the affine space and the affine subspace of defined by the equation formula_93.

For affine spaces of infinite dimension, the same definition applies, using only finite sums. This means that for each point, only a finite number of coordinates are non-zero.

=== Affine coordinates ===
An affine frame is a coordinate frame of an affine space, consisting of a point, called the &quot;origin&quot;, and a linear basis of the associated vector space. More precisely, for an affine space with associated vector space formula_1, the origin belongs to , and the linear basis is a basis of formula_1 (for simplicity of the notation, we consider only the case of finite dimension, the general case is similar).

For each point of , there is a unique sequence formula_62 of elements of the ground field such that
: formula_102
or equivalently
: formula_103

The formula_75 are called the affine coordinates of over the affine frame .

Example: In Euclidean geometry, Cartesian coordinates are affine coordinates relative to an &quot;orthonormal frame&quot;, that is an affine frame such that is an orthonormal basis.

=== Relationship between barycentric and affine coordinates ===
Barycentric coordinates and affine coordinates are strongly related, and may be considered as equivalent.

In fact, given a barycentric frame
: formula_105
one deduces immediately the affine frame
: formula_106
and, if
: formula_107
are the barycentric coordinates of a point over the barycentric frame, then the affine coordinates of the same point over the affine frame are
: formula_108

Conversely, if
: formula_109
is an affine frame, then
: formula_110
is a barycentric frame. If
: formula_111
are the affine coordinates of a point over the affine frame, then its barycentric coordinates over the barycentric frame are
: formula_112

Therefore, barycentric and affine coordinates are almost equivalent. In most applications, affine coordinates are preferred, as involving less coordinates that are independent. However, in the situations where the important points of the studied problem are affinely independent, barycentric coordinates may lead to simpler computation, as in the following example.

==== Example of the triangle ====
The vertices of a non-flat triangle form an affine basis of the Euclidean plane. The barycentric coordinates allows easy characterization of the elements of the triangle that do not involve angles or distances:

The vertices are the points of barycentric coordinates , and . The lines supporting the edges are the points that have a zero coordinate. The edges themselves are the points that have one zero coordinate and two nonnegative coordinates. The interior of the triangle are the points whose coordinates are all positive. The medians are the points that have two equal coordinates, and the centroid is the point of coordinates .

=== Change of coordinates ===

==== Case of barycentric coordinates ====
Barycentric coordinates are readily changed from one basis to another. Let formula_91 and formula_114 be affine bases of . For every in there is some tuple formula_115 for which 
: formula_94
Similarly, for every formula_117 from the first basis, we now have in the second basis
: formula_118
for some tuple formula_119. Now we can rewrite our expression in the first basis as one in the second with

: formula_120

giving us coordinates in the second basis as the tuple formula_121formula_122.

==== Case of affine coordinates ====

Affine coordinates are also readily changed from one basis to another. Let formula_123, formula_124 and formula_125, formula_126 be affine frames of . For each point of , there is a unique sequence formula_62 of elements of the ground field such that
: formula_102
and similarly, for every formula_129 from the first basis, we now have in the second basis
: formula_130
: formula_131
for tuple formula_132 and tuples formula_133. Now we can rewrite our expression in the first basis as one in the second with

: formula_134

giving us coordinates in the second basis as the tuple formula_135formula_136.

== Properties of affine homomorphisms ==

===Matrix representation===
An affine transformation formula_137 is executed on a projective space formula_138 of formula_80, by a 4 by 4 matrix with a special fourth column:

formula_140

The transformation is affine instead of linear due to the inclusion of point formula_141, the transformed output of which reveals the affine shift.

===Image and fibers===
Let
: formula_142
be an affine homomorphism, with
: formula_143
its associated linear map. The image of is the affine subspace formula_144 of , which has formula_145 as associated vector space. As an affine space does not have a zero element, an affine homomorphism does not have a kernel. However, the linear map formula_44 does, and if we denote by formula_147 its kernel, then for any point of formula_148, the inverse image formula_149 of is an affine subspace of whose direction is formula_150. This affine subspace is called the fiber of .

===Projection===

An important example is the projection parallel to some direction onto an affine subspace. The importance of this example lies in the fact that Euclidean spaces are affine spaces, and that these kinds of projections are fundamental in Euclidean geometry.

More precisely, given an affine space with associated vector space formula_151, let be an affine subspace of direction formula_152, and be a complementary subspace of formula_152 in formula_151 (this means that every vector of formula_151 may be decomposed in a unique way as the sum of an element of formula_152 and an element of ). For every point of , its projection to parallel to is the unique point in such that
: formula_157

This is an affine homomorphism whose associated linear map formula_158 is defined by
: formula_159
for and in .

The image of this projection is , and its fibers are the subspaces of direction .

=== Quotient space ===
Although kernels are not defined for affine spaces, quotient spaces are defined. This results from the fact that &quot;belonging to the same fiber of an affine homomorphism&quot; is an equivalence relation.

Let be an affine space, and be a linear subspace of the associated vector space formula_151. The quotient of by is the quotient of by the equivalence relation such that and are equivalent if
: formula_161
This quotient is an affine space, which has formula_162 as associated vector space.

For every affine homomorphism formula_163, the image is isomorphic to the quotient of by the kernel of the associated linear map. This is the first isomorphism theorem for affine spaces.

== Axioms ==
Affine spaces are usually studied by analytic geometry using coordinates, or equivalently vector spaces. They can also be studied as synthetic geometry by writing down axioms, though this approach is much less common. There are several different systems of axioms for affine space.

 axiomatizes the special case of affine geometry over the reals as ordered geometry together with an affine form of Desargues&#x27;s theorem and an axiom stating that in a plane there is at most one line through a given point not meeting a given line.

Affine planes satisfy the following axioms :
(in which two lines are called parallel if they are equal or
disjoint):
* Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.
* Given a point and line there is a unique line that contains the point and is parallel to the line
* There exist three non-collinear points.
As well as affine planes over fields (or division rings), there are also many non-Desarguesian planes satisfying these axioms. gives axioms for higher-dimensional affine spaces.

Purely axiomatic affine geometry is more general than affine spaces and is treated in a separate article.

== Relation to projective spaces ==

Affine spaces are contained in projective spaces. For example, an affine plane can be obtained from any projective plane by removing one line and all the points on it, and conversely any affine plane can be used to construct a projective plane as a closure by adding a line at infinity whose points correspond to equivalence classes of parallel lines. Similar constructions hold in higher dimensions.

Further, transformations of projective space that preserve affine space (equivalently, that leave the hyperplane at infinity invariant as a set) yield transformations of affine space. Conversely, any affine linear transformation extends uniquely to a projective linear transformation, so the affine group is a subgroup of the projective group. For instance, Möbius transformations (transformations of the complex projective line, or Riemann sphere) are affine (transformations of the complex plane) if and only if they fix the point at infinity.

== Affine algebraic geometry ==
In algebraic geometry, an affine variety (or, more generally, an affine algebraic set) is defined as the subset of an affine space that is the set of the common zeros of a set of so-called &quot;polynomial functions over the affine space&quot;. For defining a &quot;polynomial function over the affine space&quot;, one has to choose an affine frame. Then, a polynomial function is a function such that the image of any point is the value of some multivariate polynomial function of the coordinates of the point. As a change of affine coordinates may be expressed by linear functions (more precisely affine functions) of the coordinates, this definition is independent of a particular choice of coordinates.

The choice of a system of affine coordinates for an affine space formula_164 of dimension over a field induces an affine isomorphism between formula_164 and the affine coordinate space . This explains why, for simplification, many textbooks write formula_166, and introduce affine algebraic varieties as the common zeros of polynomial functions over .

As the whole affine space is the set of the common zeros of the zero polynomial, affine spaces are affine algebraic varieties.

=== Ring of polynomial functions ===
By the definition above, the choice of an affine frame of an affine space formula_164 allows one to identify the polynomial functions on formula_164 with polynomials in variables, the &quot;i&quot;th variable representing the function that maps a point to its th coordinate. It follows that the set of polynomial functions over formula_164 is a -algebra, denoted formula_170, which is isomorphic to the polynomial ring formula_171.

When one changes coordinates, the isomorphism between formula_170 and formula_173 changes accordingly, and this induces an automorphism of formula_171, which maps each indeterminate to a polynomial of degree one. It follows that the total degree defines a filtration of formula_175, which is independent from the choice of coordinates. The total degree defines also a graduation, but it depends on the choice of coordinates, as a change of affine coordinates may map indeterminates on non-homogeneous polynomials.

=== Zariski topology ===

Affine spaces over topological fields, such as the real or the complex numbers, have a natural topology. The Zariski topology, which is defined for affine spaces over any field, allows use of topological methods in any case. Zariski topology is the unique topology on an affine space whose closed sets are affine algebraic sets (that is sets of the common zeros of polynomial functions over the affine set). As, over a topological field, polynomial functions are continuous, every Zariski closed set is closed for the usual topology, if any. In other words, over a topological field, Zariski topology is coarser than the natural topology.

There is a natural injective function from an affine space into the set of prime ideals (that is the spectrum) of its ring of polynomial functions. When affine coordinates have been chosen, this function maps the point of coordinates formula_176 to the maximal ideal formula_177. This function is a homeomorphism (for the Zariski topology of the affine space and of the spectrum of the ring of polynomial functions) of the affine space onto the image of the function.

The case of an algebraically closed ground field is especially important in algebraic geometry, because, in this case, the homeomorphism above is a map between the affine space and the set of all maximal ideals of the ring of functions (this is Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz).

This is the starting idea of scheme theory of Grothendieck, which consists, for studying algebraic varieties, of considering as &quot;points&quot;, not only the points of the affine space, but also all the prime ideals of the spectrum. This allows gluing together algebraic varieties in a similar way as, for manifolds, charts are glued together for building a manifold.

=== Cohomology ===
Like all affine varieties, local data on an affine space can always be patched together globally: the cohomology of affine space is trivial. More precisely, formula_178 for all coherent sheaves F, and integers formula_179. This property is also enjoyed by all other affine varieties. But also all of the étale cohomology groups on affine space are trivial. In particular, every line bundle is trivial. More generally, the Quillen–Suslin theorem implies that &quot;every&quot; algebraic vector bundle over an affine space is trivial.

<text>In mathematics, an affine combination of is a linear combination
:formula_1 
such that 
:formula_2

Here, can be elements (vectors) of a vector space over a field , and the coefficients formula_3 are elements of .

The elements can also be points of a Euclidean space, and, more generally, of an affine space over a field . In this case the formula_3 are elements of (or formula_5 for a Euclidean space), and the affine combination is also a point. See for the definition in this case.

This concept is fundamental in Euclidean geometry and affine geometry, because the set of all affine combinations of a set of points forms the smallest affine space containing the points, exactly as the linear combinations of a set of vectors form their linear span.

The affine combinations commute with any affine transformation in the sense that
:formula_6
In particular, any affine combination of the fixed points of a given affine transformation formula_7 is also a fixed point of formula_7, so the set of fixed points of formula_7 forms an affine space (in 3D: a line or a plane, and the trivial cases, a point or the whole space).

When a stochastic matrix, , acts on a column vector, &#x27;, the result is a column vector whose entries are affine combinations of &#x27; with coefficients from the rows in .
