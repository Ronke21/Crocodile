<text>Stanislav Stanislavovich Shushkevich (15 December 1934 – 3 May 2022) was a Belarusian politician and scientist. From 25 August 1991 to 26 January 1994, he was the first head of state of independent Belarus after it seceded from the Soviet Union, serving as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet (also called chairman of Parliament or president). He supported social democratic reforms and played a key role in the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

As a scientist, he was a corresponding member of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, Doctor in Physics and Mathematics, recipient of various state awards, professor and the author and originator of textbooks and over 150 articles and 50 inventions.

== Biography ==
Shushkevich was born on 15 December 1934, in Minsk. His parents were teachers who came from peasant families. His father, poet Stanislau Petrovich Shushkevich (born 19 February 1908 in Minsk) was arrested in the 1930s and was released from prison in 1956 (but completely exonerated only in 1975). His mother, writer Helena Romanowska was ethnically Polish and her family had szlachta (noble) roots. During World War II Shushkevich lived with his mother and grandmother in Nazi-occupied Minsk, with a Jewish boy hiding in their house.

After finishing school with a medal in 1951, he entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the Belarusian State University and graduated in 1956. He subsequently studied at the graduate school of the Institute of Physics of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, conducting research in the field of radio electronics.

In the early 1960s, while working as an engineer in an electronics factory, he was in charge of teaching the Russian language to Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald lived in Minsk. This is confirmed by a CIA document, RIF #104-10014-10053. 

He was married to his wife Irina from 1976 onward. According to him, she forced him to start a healthy lifestyle. He had a son named Stanislav and daughter named Elena. Shushkevich was admitted to hospital and placed in an intensive care unit in April 2022, due to complications from COVID-19. On the night of May 3rd, Shushkevich died in Minsk.

== Political activity ==
When Supreme Soviet chairman Mikalay Dzyemyantsyey was ousted for his support of the August 1991 coup attempt, Shushkevich became interim speaker, and presided over Belarus voting to secede from the Soviet Union. He thus became the newly minted nation&#x27;s first leader. On 18 September, Shushkevich was elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet.
On 8 December 1991, in Belavezhskaya Pushcha and together with the leaders of Russia (Boris Yeltsin) and Ukraine (Leonid Kravchuk), he signed a declaration that the Soviet Union was dissolved and replaced by the Commonwealth of Independent States; the declaration later became known as the &quot;Belovezh Accords&quot;.

Shushkevich had the vestigial Soviet nuclear arsenal (both tactical and strategic) withdrawn from Belarus, without preconditions or compensation from Russia or the West. However, other reforms became stalled due to the opposition from a hostile parliament as well as from Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich.

In late 1993, Alexander Lukashenko, the then-chairman of the anti-corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament, accused 70 senior government officials, including Shushkevich, of corruption, including stealing state funds for personal purposes. Lukashenko&#x27;s accusations forced a vote of confidence, which Shushkevich lost. Shushkevich was replaced by Vyacheslav Kuznetsov and later by Myechyslau Hryb.

At the 1994 Belarusian presidential election (the first one after the secession from the Soviet Union), six candidates stood, including Lukashenko, Shushkevich and Kebich, with the latter regarded as the clear favorite. In the first round Lukashenko won 45% of the vote against 17% for Kebich, 13% for Paznyak and 10% for Shushkevich.

In 2002 Shushkevich sued the Belarusian Ministry of Labor and Social Security: due to inflation, his retirement pension as a former head of state was the equivalent of US$1.80 monthly. To earn income, Shushkevich lectured extensively in foreign universities including in Poland, the United States and Asian countries.

In 2004 he attempted to participate in parliamentary elections, but was refused registration by the electoral commission.

He continued to be active in politics, heading the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly party from 1998 until 2018.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1966 with the song &quot;A Man Without Love&quot;, composed by Cyril Ornadel, with lyrics by Peter Callander, and performed by Kenneth McKellar. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performer internally.

==Before Eurovision==
===&quot;A Song for Europe 1966&quot;===
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held a national preselection to choose the song that would go to the Eurovision Song Contest 1966, with the BBC selecting Kenneth McKellar to perform all the entries under consideration. After performing the five shortlisted songs weekly on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Kenneth McKellar&#x27;s A Song For Everyone&quot;, the final was held on 27 January 1966 and presented by David Jacobs. McKellar released an extended play maxi single featuring the five songs, subsequently releasing a single featuring the winner and the runner up, which reached number 30 in the UK Singles Chart.

Viewers cast votes on postcards via mail to choose the winning song, which was &quot;A Man Without Love&quot;. At the Eurovision Song Contest, McKellar performed last in the contest, finishing ninth out of 18 entries, the worst showing to date for a British entry; a record maintained until 1978.
==At Eurovision==
&quot;A Man Without Love&quot; won the national and went on to come ninth in the contest.

For the sixth and final time, David Jacobs provided the commentary for BBC Television. British Forces Radio also broadcast the contest with commentary provided by Ian Fenner. The BBC appointed Michael Aspel as its spokesperson to announce the British jury vote.

<doc id="296515" wikidata="Q76167" url="?curid=296515" title="Abdurrahman Wahid">
<text>Abdurrahman Wahid ( ; né ad-Dakhil, 7 September 1940 – 30 December 2009), more colloquially known as Gus Dur (), was an Indonesian politician and Islamic religious leader who served as the fourth president of Indonesia, from his election in 1999 until he was removed from office in 2001. A long time leader within the Nahdlatul Ulama organization, he was the founder of the National Awakening Party (PKB). He was the son of Minister of Religious Affairs Wahid Hasyim, and the grandson of Nahdatul Ulama founder Hasyim Asy&#x27;ari. Due to a visual impairment caused by glaucoma, he was blind in the left eye and partially blind in his right eye. He was the first (and to date only) president of Indonesia to have had physical disabilities. The name &quot;Abdurrahman Wahid&quot; means &quot;Servant of Mercy the First.&quot;

Wahid was instrumental in lifting the ban on Chinese New Year (). Until 1998, the spiritual practice to celebrate the Chinese New Year by Chinese families was restricted specifically only inside of Chinese community centers. This restriction is made by the New Order government through Presidential Instruction No. 14 of 1967 signed by Suharto. On 17 January 2000, Wahid issued Presidential Decree No. 6 of 2000 to annul the previous instruction. He established Confucianism as the sixth official religion in Indonesia in 2000 and protected minority rights in Indonesia. As a result, Wahid was given the title &quot;Father of Pluralism.&quot;

His popular nickname &#x27;Gus Dur&#x27; is derived from &quot;Gus&quot;, a common honorific for a son of kyai, and from the short-form of &quot;bagus&quot; (&#x27;handsome lad&#x27; in Javanese); and &quot;Dur&quot;, short-form of his name, Abdurrahman.

==Early life and family==
Abdurrahman ad-Dakhil was born on the fourth day of the Sha&#x27;ban, the eighth month of the Islamic calendar in 1940 in Jombang, to Abdul Wahid Hasyim and Siti Sholehah. This led to a belief that he was born on 4 August; instead, using the Islamic calendar to mark his birth date meant that he was actually born on 4 Sha&#x27;aban, equivalent to 7 September 1940.

He was named after Abd ar-Rahman I of the Umayyad Caliphate who brought Islam to Spain and was thus nicknamed &quot;ad-Dakhil&quot; (&quot;the conqueror&quot;). His name is stylized in the traditional Arabic naming system as &quot;Abdurrahman, son of Wahid&quot;. Abdurrahman is of Chinese, Arab and Javanese ancestry. From his paternal line, he is descended from a well-known Muslim missionary from China known as Syekh Abdul Qadir Tan Kiem Han who was a disciple of Sunan Ngampel-Denta (Raden Rahmat Bong Swie Hoo), one of the Nine Wali (Holy Islamic Saints) who became one of the first Islamic Kings on Java who Islamicized Java in the 15-16th centuries.

He was the oldest of his five siblings, and was born into a very prestigious family in the East Java Muslim community. His paternal grandfather, Hasyim Asy&#x27;ari was the founder of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) while his maternal grandfather, Bisri Syansuri was the first Muslim educator to introduce classes for women.

After the Indonesian Declaration of Independence on 17 August 1945, Abdurrahman Wahid moved back to Jombang and remained there during the fight for independence from the Netherlands during the Indonesian National Revolution. At the end of the war in 1949, Abdurrahman Wahid moved to Jakarta as his father had been appointed Minister of Religious Affairs. He was educated in Jakarta, going to KRIS Primary School before moving to Matraman Perwari Primary School. Abdurrahman Wahid was encouraged to read non-Muslim books, magazines, and newspapers by his father to further broaden his horizons. He stayed in Jakarta with his family even after his father&#x27;s removal as Minister of Religious Affairs in 1952. In April 1953, Abdurrahman&#x27;s father died in a car crash.

In 1954, Abdurrahman Wahid began Junior High School. That year, he failed to graduate to the next year and was forced to repeat. His mother made the decision to send him to Yogyakarta to continue his education. In 1957, after graduating from Junior High School, he moved to Magelang to begin his Muslim education at Tegalrejo Pesantren (Muslim school). He completed the &quot;pesantren&quot; course in two years instead of the usual four. In 1959, he moved back to Jombang to &quot;Pesantren Tambakberas&quot;. There, while continuing his own education, Abdurrahman Wahid received his first job as a teacher and later on as headmaster of a &quot;madrasah&quot; affiliated with the &quot;pesantren&quot;. Abdurrahman Wahid found employment as a journalist for magazines such as &quot;Horizon&quot; and &quot;Majalah Budaya Jaya&quot;.

==Overseas education==

In 1963, Abdurrahman Wahid received a scholarship from the Ministry of Religious Affairs to study at Al Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. He left for Egypt in November 1963. Unable to provide evidence to certify that he spoke Arabic, Abdurrahman was told when arriving that he would have to take a remedial class in the language before enrolling at the university&#x27;s Higher Institute for Islamic and Arabic studies.

Instead of attending classes, Abdurrahman Wahid spent 1964 enjoying life in Egypt, watching European and American movies as well as indulging in his hobby of watching football. Abdurrahman was also involved with the Association of Indonesian Students and became a journalist for the association&#x27;s magazine. After passing the remedial Arabic examination, he finally began studies at the Higher Institute for Islamic and Arabic Studies in 1965, but was disappointed as he had already studied many of the texts offered at the Institute in Java and disapproved of the rote learning method used by the university.

In Egypt, Abdurrahman Wahid found employment with the Indonesian Embassy. It was during his stint with the embassy that coup attempt was launched by the 30 September Movement, which the Communist Party of Indonesia was accused of leading. With Army Strategic Reserves commander Major General Suharto taking control of the situation in Jakarta, a crackdown against suspected communists was initiated. The Indonesian Embassy in Egypt was ordered to conduct an investigation into the political views of university students. This order was passed to Abdurrahman Wahid, who was charged with writing the reports.

Abdurrahman&#x27;s displeasure at the method of education and his work following the coup attempt distracted him from his studies. He sought and received another scholarship at the University of Baghdad and moved to Iraq. There Abdurrahman Wahid continued his involvement with the Association of Indonesian Students as well as with writing journalistic pieces to be read in Indonesia.

After completing his education at the University of Baghdad in 1970, Abdurrahman Wahid went to the Netherlands to continue his education. He wanted to attend Leiden University but was disappointed as there was little recognition for the studies that he had undertaken at the University of Baghdad. From the Netherlands, he went to Germany and France before returning to Indonesia in 1971.

==Early career==
Abdurrahman Wahid returned to Jakarta expecting that in a year&#x27;s time, he would be abroad again to study at McGill University in Canada. He kept himself busy by joining the (LP3ES), an organization which consisted of intellectuals with progressive Muslims and social-democratic views. LP3ES established the magazine &quot;Prisma&quot; and Abdurrahman became one of the main contributors to the magazine. Whilst working as a contributor for LP3ES, he also conducted tours to &quot;pesantren&quot; and &quot;madrasah&quot; across Java. It was a time when &quot;pesantren&quot; were desperate to gain state funding by adopting state-endorsed curricula and Abdurrahman was concerned that the traditional values of the &quot;pesantren&quot; were being damaged because of this change. He was also concerned with the poverty of the &quot;pesantren&quot; which he saw during his tours. At the same time as it was encouraging &quot;pesantren&quot; to adopt state-endorsed curricula, the Government was also encouraging &quot;pesantren&quot; as agents for change and to help assist the government in the economic development of Indonesia. It was at this time that Abdurrahman Wahid finally decided to drop plans for overseas studies in favor of promoting the development of the &quot;pesantren&quot;.

Abdurrahman Wahid continued his career as a journalist, writing for the magazine &quot;Tempo&quot; and &quot;Kompas&quot;, a leading Indonesian newspaper. His articles were well received, and he began to develop a reputation as a social commentator. Abdurrahman&#x27;s popularity was such that at this time he was invited to give lectures and seminars, obliging him to travel back and forth between Jakarta and Jombang, where he now lived with his family.

Despite having a successful career up to that point, Abdurrahman Wahid still found it hard to make ends meet, and he worked to earn extra income by selling peanuts and delivering ice to be used for his wife&#x27;s &quot;es lilin&quot; (popsicle) business. In 1974, he found extra employment in Jombang as a Muslim Legal Studies teacher at Pesantren Tambakberas and soon developed a good reputation. A year later, Abdurrahman added to his workload as a teacher of Kitab al-Hikam, a classical text of sufism.

In 1977, Abdurrahman Wahid joined the Hasyim Asyari University as Dean of the Faculty of Islamic Beliefs and Practices. Again he excelled in his job and the university wanted to him to teach extra subjects such as pedagogy, sharia, and missiology. However, his excellence caused some resentment from within the ranks of university and he was blocked from teaching the subjects. Whilst undertaking all these ventures he also regularly delivered speeches during Ramadan to the Muslim community in Jombang.

==Leader of Nahdlatul Ulama==
===Early involvement with NU===
Abdurrahman&#x27;s family background meant that sooner or later, he would be asked to play an active role in the running of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU). This ran contrary to Abdurrahman&#x27;s aspirations of becoming a public intellectual and he had twice rejected offers to join the NU Religious Advisory Council. Nevertheless, Abdurrahman finally chose to join the Council when his own grandfather, Bisri Syansuri gave him the third offer. In taking this job, Abdurrahman also made the decision to move from Jombang to Jakarta and to permanently reside there. As a member of the Religious Advisory Council, Abdurrahman envisioned himself as a reformer of NU.

At this time, Abdurrahman Wahid also had his first political experience. In the lead-up to the 1982 Legislative Elections, Abdurrahman Wahid campaigned for the United Development Party (PPP), an Islamist Party which was formed as a result of a merger of four Islamist parties including NU. Abdurrahman Wahid recalled that the Government actively disrupted PPP&#x27;s campaigns by arresting people like himself. However, Abdurrahman Wahid was always able to secure his release, having developed connections in high places with the likes of General Benny Moerdani.

===Reformation of NU===
By this time, many viewed the NU as a stagnant organization. After careful discussion, the Religious Advisory Council finally formed a Team of Seven (which included Abdurrahman) to tackle the issues of reform and to help revitalize the NU. For some members of the NU, reform in the organization involved a change of leadership. On 2 May 1982, a group of high-ranking NU officials met with NU chairman Idham Chalid and asked for his resignation. Idham, who had guided the NU in the transition from Sukarno to Suharto resisted at first but bowed down to pressure. On 6 May 1982, Abdurrahman Wahid heard of Idham&#x27;s decision to resign and approached him saying that the demands being made for him to resign were unconstitutional. With urging from Abdurrahman Wahid, Idham withdrew his resignation and Abdurrahman Wahid, together with the Team of Seven was able to negotiate a compromise between Idham and those who had asked for his resignation.

In 1983, Suharto was re-elected to a fourth term as president by the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR) and began taking steps to establish the Pancasila state ideology as the sole basis for all organizations. From June 1983 to October 1983, Abdurrahman was part of a team which was commissioned to prepare the NU&#x27;s response to this issue. Abdurrahman consulted texts such as the Quran and Sunnah for justification and finally, in October 1983, concluded that the NU should accept Pancasila as its ideology. To further revitalize the NU, Abdurrahman was also successful in securing its withdrawal from PPP and party politics to allow it focus on social matters instead of hampering itself by being involved in politics.

===Election to chairmanship and first term as chairman===
Abdurrahman&#x27;s reforms had made him extremely popular within the ranks of NU. By the time of the 1984 National Congress, many began to state their intentions to nominate Abdurrahman as the new chairman of NU. Abdurrahman accepted the nomination, provided that he had the power to choose who would be on his leadership team. Abdurrahman was elected as the new chairman of NU during the National Congress. However, his stipulation of choosing his own team was not honored. The last day of the Congress had begun with Abdurrahman&#x27;s list of team members being approved by high-ranking NU officials including outgoing Chairman Idham. Abdurrahman had gone to the Committee in charge of running the Congress and handed in his list which was to be announced later. However, the Committee in question was against Idham and announced a totally different list of people. Abdurrahman was outraged but was pressured to accept the changes made.

Abdurrahman&#x27;s ascendancy to the NU chairmanship was seen positively by Suharto and his New Order regime. Abdurrahman&#x27;s acceptance of Pancasila along with his moderate image won him favor among Government ranks. In 1985, Suharto made Abdurrahman a Pancasila indoctrinator. In 1987, Abdurrahman showed further support for the regime by criticizing PPP in the lead-up to the 1987 Legislative Elections and further strengthening Suharto&#x27;s Golkar Party. His reward came in the form of a membership of the MPR. Although he was viewed with favor by the regime, Abdurrahman criticised the Government over the Kedung Ombo Dam project that was funded by the World Bank. Although this somewhat soured the cordial relationships that Abdurrahman had with the Government, Suharto was still keen on getting political support from NU.

During his first term as chairman of NU, Abdurrahman focused on reform of the &quot;pesantren&quot; education system and was successful in increasing the quality of &quot;pesantren&quot; education system so that it can match up with secular schools. In 1987, Abdurrahman also set up study groups in Probolinggo to provide a forum for like-minded individuals within NU to discuss and provide interpretations to Muslim texts. Critics accused Abdurrahman of wishing to replace the Arabic Muslim greeting of &quot;&quot;assalamualaikum&quot; with the secular greeting of &quot;selamat pagi&quot;&quot;, which means &quot;good morning&quot; in Indonesian.

===Second term as chairman and opposing the New Order===
Abdurrahman was re-elected to a second term as chairman of NU at the 1989 National Congress. By this time, Suharto, embroiled in a political battle with ABRI, began to ingratiate himself with the Muslim constituency so as to win their support. This venture reached a turning point in December 1990 with the formation of the Indonesian Association of Muslim Intellectuals (&quot;Ikatan Cendekiawan Muslim Indonesia&quot; or ICMI). This organization was backed by Suharto, chaired by BJ Habibie and included Muslim intellectuals such as Amien Rais and Nurcholish Madjid as its members. In 1991, various members of ICMI asked Abdurrahman to join. Abdurrahman declined because he thought that ICMI encouraged sectarianism and that it was mainly a means by which Suharto manoeuvred to remain powerful. In 1991, Abdurrahman countered ICMI by forming the Democracy Forum, an organization which contained 45 intellectuals from various religious and social communities. The organization was seen as a threat by the government, which moved to break up meetings held by the Democracy Forum during the run-up to the 1992 Legislative Elections approached.

In March 1992, Abdurrahman Wahid planned to have a Great Assembly to celebrate the 66th anniversary of the founding of NU and to reiterate the organization&#x27;s support for Pancasila. Abdurrahman Wahid had planned for the event to be attended by at least one million NU members. However, Suharto moved to block the event, ordering policemen to turn back busloads of NU members as they arrived in Jakarta. Nevertheless, the event managed to attract 200,000 attendants. After the event, Abdurrahman Wahid wrote a letter of protest to Suharto saying that NU had not been given a chance to display a brand of Islam that was open, fair, and tolerant. During his second term as chairman of NU, Abdurrahman&#x27;s liberal ideas had begun to turn many supporters sour. As chairman, Abdurrahman Wahid continued to push for inter-faith dialogue and even accepted an invitation to visit Israel in October 1994.

===Third term as chairman and the lead-up to &quot;Reformasi&quot;===
As the 1994 National Congress approached, Abdurrahman Wahid nominated himself for a third term as chairman. Hearing this, Suharto wanted to make sure that Abdurrahman Wahid was not elected. In the weeks leading up to the Congress, Suharto supporters, such as Habibie and Harmoko campaigned against Abdurrahman&#x27;s re-election. When it came time for the National Congress, the site for the Congress was tightly guarded by ABRI in an act of intimidation. Despite this, and attempts to bribe NU members to vote against him, Abdurrahman Wahid was re-elected as NU chairman for a third term. During his third term, Abdurrahman Wahid began to move closer towards a political alliance with Megawati Sukarnoputri from the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI). Capitalizing on her father&#x27;s legacy, Megawati had a lot of popularity and intended to put political and moral pressure on Suharto&#x27;s regime. Abdurrahman advised Megawati to be cautious and to avoid being nominated as president during the 1998 MPR General Session. Megawati ignored Abdurrahman&#x27;s advice and paid the price in July 1996 when her PDI headquarters were taken over by supporters of Government-backed PDI chairman, Suryadi.

Seeing what happened to Megawati, Abdurrahman thought that his best option now was to retreat politically by getting himself back in favor with the Government. In November 1996, Abdurrahman Wahid and Suharto met for the first time since Abdurrahman&#x27;s re-election to the NU chairmanship and this was followed over the next few months by meetings with various Government people who in 1994 had attempted to block Abdurrahman&#x27;s re-election. At the same time, however, Abdurrahman Wahid kept his options for reform open and in December 1996, had a meeting with Amien Rais, an ICMI member who had grown critical of the regime.

July 1997 saw the beginning of the Asian Financial Crisis. Suharto began to lose control of the situation and just as he was being pushed to step up the reform movement with Megawati and Amien, Abdurrahman experienced a stroke in January 1998. From his hospital bed, Abdurrahman Wahid continued to see the situation worsen with Suharto&#x27;s re-election to a seventh term as president accompanied by student protests. The protests would turn into riots in May 1998 after the killing of four students at Trisakti University. On 19 May 1998, Abdurrahman Wahid, together with eight prominent leaders from the Muslim community were summoned to Suharto&#x27;s residence. Suharto outlined the idea of a Reform Committee which he had begun to propose at the time. All nine rejected Suharto&#x27;s offer to join the Reform Committee. Abdurrahman Wahid maintained a more moderate stance with Suharto and called on the protesting to stop to see if Suharto was going to implement his promise. This displeased Amien who was one of the most vocal of Suharto&#x27;s critics at the time. Nevertheless, support for Suharto quickly ebbed away, and he resigned the presidency on 21 May 1998. Vice President Habibie became president.

==&quot;Reformasi&quot; era==
===Formation of PKB and the Ciganjur statement===

One of the immediate effects of Suharto&#x27;s fall was the formation of new political parties. Under Suharto&#x27;s regime, political parties had been limited to just three; Golkar, PPP, and PDI. Now with his fall, new political parties were formed, the most prominent of which were Amien&#x27;s National Mandate Party (PAN) and Megawati&#x27;s Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P). In June 1998, many from within the NU community began pressuring Abdurrahman Wahid to form a new political party. Abdurrahman Wahid did not warm up to the idea immediately, thinking that this would result in a political party which only catered to one religion. He was also unwilling to overrule his own decision to take NU out of politics. By July 1998, however, he began to warm up to the idea, thinking that establishing a political party was the only way to challenge the organizationally strong Golkar in an election. With that in mind, Abdurrahman Wahid approved of the formation of PKB and became the chairman of its Advisory Council with Matori Abdul Djalil as party chairman. Although it was clearly dominated by NU members, Abdurrahman Wahid promoted the PKB as a party that was non-sectarian and open to all members of society.

As opposition to the government, Abdurrahman Wahid, together with Megawati and Amien were willing to adopt a moderate stance towards Habibie&#x27;s Government, preferring instead to wait for the 1999 legislative elections. Nevertheless, in November 1998, in a meeting at his residence in the Jakarta suburb of Ciganjur, Abdurrahman, together with Megawati, Amien, and Sultan Hamengkubuwono X reiterated their commitment to reform. On 7 February 1999, PKB officially declared Abdurrahman Wahid as their presidential candidate.

===1999 elections and MPR General Session===
In June 1999, Abdurrahman&#x27;s PKB entered the legislative elections. The PKB won 12% of the votes with Megawati&#x27;s PDI-P winning the legislative elections with 33% of the votes. With her party decisively winning the legislative elections, Megawati expected to win the presidency against Habibie at the MPR General Session. However, the PDI-P did not have complete majority and formed a loose alliance with the PKB. In July, however, Amien Rais would form the Central Axis, a coalition of Muslim parties. The Central Axis then began to consider nominating Abdurrahman as a third candidate in the presidential race and the PKB&#x27;s commitment towards PDI-P began to waver.

In October 1999, the MPR convened and Abdurrahman threw his support behind Amien, who was elected as the chairman of the MPR. On 7 October 1999, Amien and the Central Axis, who now had the PKB on their side, officially nominated Abdurrahman as a presidential candidate. On 19 October 1999, the MPR rejected Habibie&#x27;s accountability speech and Habibie withdrew from the presidential race. In the hours that followed, Akbar Tanjung, chairman of Golkar and head of the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) made it clear that Golkar would support Abdurrahman in his bid for the presidency. On 20 October 1999, the MPR convened and began voting for a new president. Abdurrahman Wahid was elected as Indonesia&#x27;s fourth president with 373 votes to Megawati&#x27;s 313 votes.

Displeased that their candidate had not won the presidency, Megawati&#x27;s supporters began to riot. Abdurrahman realized that for this to stop, Megawati had to be elected as vice president. After convincing General Wiranto not to contest vice presidential elections and getting the PKB to endorse Megawati, Abdurrahman Wahid persuaded the demoralized Megawati to stand. On 21 October 1999, Megawati defeated the PPP&#x27;s Hamzah Haz and was inaugurated as vice president.

==Presidency (1999–2001)==

===Early presidency (1999)===
Abdurrahman&#x27;s first cabinet, dubbed the National Unity Cabinet, was a coalition cabinet which consisted of members of various political parties: PDI-P, PKB, Golkar, PPP, PAN, and the Justice Party (PK). Non-partisans and the TNI (Formerly known as ABRI) were also represented in the cabinet. Abdurrahman then went on to make two administrative reforms. The first administrative reform was to abolish the Ministry of Information, the Suharto regime&#x27;s main weapon in controlling the media, while the second administrative reform was to disband the Ministry of Social Affairs which had become corrupt and extortionist under the Suharto regime.

In November, Abdurrahman Wahid made his first overseas trip, visiting ASEAN member countries, Japan, the United States of America, Qatar, Kuwait, and Jordan. He followed this up in December by a visit to the People&#x27;s Republic of China.
After only a month in the National Unity Cabinet, Coordinating Minister of People&#x27;s Welfare Hamzah Haz announced his resignation in November. There was suspicion that the resignation was brought about by Abdurrahman&#x27;s allegation that certain members of his Cabinet were involved in corruption while he was still in America. Others suggested that Hamzah&#x27;s resignation was because of displeasure due to Abdurrahman&#x27;s conciliatory stance towards Israel.

Abdurrahman&#x27;s plan in Aceh was to give it a referendum. However, this referendum would be to decide on various modes of autonomy rather than to decide on independence like in East Timor. Abdurrahman Wahid also wanted to adopt a softer stance towards Aceh by having fewer military personnel on the ground. On 30 December, Abdurrahman Wahid visited Jayapura in Papua, the province which was then known as Irian Jaya. During his visit, Abdurrhaman Abdurrahman was successful in convincing Papuan leaders that he was a force for change and even encouraged the use of the name Papua.

===Mid-presidency (2000)===

In January, Abdurrahman Wahid made another overseas trip to Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum and visited Saudi Arabia on the way back to Indonesia. In February, Abdurrahman made another trip to Europe visiting the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. On the way back to Europe, Abdurrahman also visited India, South Korea, Thailand, and Brunei. March saw Abdurrahman visit East Timor. In April, Abdurrahman visited South Africa en route to the G77 summit in Cuba before returning via Mexico City and Hong Kong. In June, Abdurrahman Wahid once again visited America, Japan, and France with Iran, Pakistan, and Egypt as the new additions to the list of countries which he had visited.

Abdurrahman Wahid admired Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad&#x27;s financial independence and standing up to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

====Dismissals of ministers====
While he was travelling to Europe in February, Abdurrahman Wahid began asking for the resignation of General Wiranto, who held the position of Coordinating Minister of Politics and Security. Abdurrahman saw Wiranto both as an obstacle to his planned reform of the military as well as being a liability to his government with his human rights abuses in East Timor. 
When Abdurrahman arrived back in Jakarta, Wiranto talked to him and seemed successful in convincing Abdurrahman not to replace him. However, Abdurrahman Wahid would change his mind and ask for his resignation. In April 2000, Abdurrahman Wahid dismissed Minister of Industry and Trade Jusuf Kalla and Minister of State Owned Enterprises Laksamana Sukardi. The explanation that he gave was that the two were involved in corruption, although he never gave evidence to back it up. This move soured Abdurrahman&#x27;s relations with Golkar and PDI-P.

====Negotiations in Aceh====
In March 2000, Abdurrahman&#x27;s Government began to open negotiations with the Free Aceh Movement (GAM). Two months later, in May, the Government signed a memorandum of understanding with GAM to last until the beginning of 2001, by which time both signatories would have breached the agreement.

====Other overtures toward reconciliation====
In March 2000, Abdurrahman Wahid suggested that the 1966 Provisional People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPRS) resolution on the banning of Marxism–Leninism be lifted.

Abdurrahman Wahid also moved to establish commercial relations with Israel, which aroused the ire of many Indonesian Muslim groups. This was one issue that arose in the briefing given to a Palestinian parliamentary delegation in 2000 by Riddhi Awad, their ambassador to Indonesia. Another issue was Abdurrahman&#x27;s membership in the Shimon Peres Foundation. Both Abdurrahman Wahid and his foreign minister Alwi Shihab took offense at the inaccurate portrayals of the Indonesian president, and Alwi called for the replacement of Awad. However, Nurcholish Madjid pointed out that Abdurrahman&#x27;s personal neutrality toward the Israel-Palestine conflict should yield to the feelings of the &quot;majority&quot; of Indonesians, who support Palestine. Abdurrahman visited Israel six times. In an interview with Israeli media he said, 
====Relationship with TNI====
When he ascended to the presidency, one of Abdurrahman&#x27;s goals was to reform the military and to take it out of its dominant socio-political role. In this venture, Abdurrahman found an ally in Agus Wirahadikusumah who he made Commander of Kostrad in March. In July, Agus began uncovering a scandal involving Dharma Putra, a foundation with affiliations to Kostrad. Through Megawati, TNI members began pressuring Abdurrahman to remove Agus. Abdurrahman gave in to the pressure but then planned to have Agus appointed as the Army Chief of Staff to which TNI top brass responded by threatening to retire and Abdurrahman once again bowed down to pressure.

Abdurrahman&#x27;s relationship with the TNI deteriorated even further in July 2000 when it was revealed that Laskar Jihad had arrived in Maluku and was being armed by the TNI. Laskar Jihad, a radical Islamic militia had earlier in the year planned to go to Maluku and assist Muslims there in their communal conflict with the Christians. Abdurrahman had ordered TNI to block Laskar Jihad from going to Maluku, but nevertheless they still made it to Maluku and they were then being armed with what turned out to be TNI weapons.

====Buloggate and Bruneigate====
2000 saw Abdurrahman embroiled in two scandals which would damage his presidency. In May, the Logistic Affairs Agency (BULOG) reported that US$4 million were missing from its cash reserve. The missing cash was then attributed to Abdurrahman&#x27;s own masseur, who had claimed that Abdurrahman sent him to Bulog to collect the cash. Although the money was returned, Abdurrahman&#x27;s opponents took the chance of accusing him of being involved in the scandal and of being aware of what his masseur was up to. At the same time, Abdurrahman was also accused of keeping US$2 million for himself. The money was a donation by the Sultan of Brunei to provide assistance in Aceh. However, Abdurrahman failed to account for the money.

====Cabinet reshuffle====
As the 2000 MPR Annual Session approached, Abdurrahman&#x27;s popularity with the people was still at a high and politically, allies such as Megawati, Akbar, and Amien were still willing to support Abdurrahman despite the sacking of the ministers and the scandals which he had been involved in. At the same time, however, they were asking questions of Abdurrahman. At the 2000 MPR Annual Session, Abdurrahman delivered a speech which was well received by a majority of the MPR members. During the speech, Abdurrahman recognized his weakness as an administrator and said that he was going to delegate the day-to-day running of the government to a senior minister. The MPR members agreed but proposed that Megawati should be the one to receive the task from the president. At first the MPR planned to have this proposal adopted as a resolution but a presidential decision was seen as enough. On 23 August, Abdurrahman announced a new cabinet despite Megawati&#x27;s insistence that the announcement was delayed. Megawati showed her displeasure by not showing up for the cabinet announcement. The new cabinet was smaller and consisted of more non-partisans. There were no Golkar members in this cabinet.

====Regional unrests====
In September, Abdurrahman declared martial law in Maluku as the condition there continued to deteriorate. By now, it was evident that Laskar Jihad were being assisted by TNI members and it was also apparent that they were financed by Fuad Bawazier, the last Minister of Finance to have served under Suharto. During the same month, the West Papuans raised their Morning Star flag. Abdurrahman&#x27;s response was to allow the West Papuans to do this provided that the Morning Star flag was placed lower than the Indonesian flag. For this, he was severely criticized by Megawati and Akbar. On 24 December 2000, there were terror attacks directed against churches in Jakarta and in eight cities across Indonesia.

====Gathering political opposition====
By the end of 2000, there were many within the political elite who were disillusioned with Abdurrahman. The most obvious person who showed this disillusion was Amien who showed regret at supporting Abdurrahman to the presidency the previous year. Amien also attempted to rally opposition by encouraging Megawati and Akbar to flex their political muscles. Megawati surprisingly defended Abdurrahman whilst Akbar preferred to wait for the 2004 legislative election. At the end of November, 151 DPR members signed a petition calling for the impeachment of Abdurrahman.

===Removal from power (2001)===

In January, Abdurrahman made the announcement that Chinese New Year was to become an optional holiday. Abdurrahman followed this up in February by lifting the ban on the display of Chinese characters and the imports of Chinese publications. In February, Abdurrahman visited Northern Africa as well as Saudi Arabia to undertake the Hajj pilgrimage. Abdurrahman made his last overseas visit in June 2001 when he visited Australia.

At a meeting with university rectors on 27 January 2001, Abdurrahman commented on the possibility of Indonesia descending into anarchy. Abdurrahman then made the suggestion that he may be forced to dissolve the DPR if that happened. Although the meeting was off-the-record, it caused quite a stir and added to the fuel of the movement against him. On 1 February, the DPR met to issue a memorandum against Abdurrahman. Two memorandums constitute an MPR Special Session where the impeachment and removal of a president would be legal. The vote was overwhelmingly for the memorandum and PKB members could only walk out in protest. The memorandum caused widespread protests by NU members. In East Java, NU members went around to Golkar&#x27;s regional offices and trashed it. In Jakarta, Abdurrahman&#x27;s opposition began accusing him of encouraging the protests. Abdurrahman denied it and went to talk to the protesters at the town of Pasuruan; encouraging them to get off the streets. Nevertheless, NU protesters continued to show their support for Abdurrahman and in April, made the announcement that they were ready to defend and die for the President.

In March, Abdurrahman Wahid tried to counter the opposition by moving against dissidents within his own Cabinet. Minister of Justice Yusril Ihza Mahendra was removed for making public his demands for the President&#x27;s resignation while Minister of Forestry Nur Mahmudi Ismail was also removed under the suspicion of channelling his department&#x27;s funds to Abdurrahman&#x27;s opposition. In response to this, Megawati began to distance herself and did not show up for the inauguration of the Ministers&#x27; replacement. On 30 April, the DPR issued a second memorandum and on the next day called for an MPR Special Session to be held on 1 August. On 12 June, he reshuffled his cabinet to shore up support.

By July, Abdurrahman Wahid grew desperate and ordered Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security to declare a State of Emergency. Yudhoyono refused and Abdurrahman removed him from his position. Finally on 20 July, Amien declared that the MPR Special Session will be brought forward to 23 July. TNI, having had a bad relationship with Abdurrahman through his tenure as president, stationed 40,000 troops in Jakarta and placed tanks with their turrets pointing at the Presidential Palace in a show of force. To prevent the MPR Special Session from taking place, Abdurrahman then enacted a Decree disbanding the MPR on 23 July despite having no power to do so. In defiance against Abdurrahman&#x27;s decree, the MPR continued the Special Session and unanimously voted to impeach Abdurrahman Wahid. The same session also saw the MPR voted to affirm Megawati succession to the presidency, effectively replacing him. Abdurrahman Wahid continued to insist that he was the president and stayed for some days in the Presidential Palace, but eventually left the residence on 25 July for a trip overseas to the United States for health treatments.

==Post-presidency==
===Schism within the PKB===
After his impeachment, Abdurrahman Wahid turned his eyes to , who was the chairman of PKB. Before the MPR Special Session, it was agreed upon that no PKB members would attend as a sign of solidarity. However, Matori insisted on attending because he was a vice-chairman of the MPR and participated in the impeachment process. Using his position as chairman of the Advisory Council, Abdurrhaman Abdurrahman sacked Matori as chairman of PKB on 15 August 2001 and suspended him from party activities before stripping Matori of Party membership in November. On 14 January 2002, Matori held a Special National Congress attended by his supporters in PKB. The Special National Congress re-elected him to the position of PKB chairman. Abddurahman Abdurrahman countered this by holding his own PKB National Congress on 17 January, a day after Matori&#x27;s Congress ended The National Congress re-elected Abdurrahman Wahid to the position of chairman of the Advisory Council and elected Alwi Shihab as its chairman. Abdurrahman&#x27;s PKB would be known as PKB Kuningan whilst Matori&#x27;s PKB would be known as PKB Batutulis.

===2004 legislative and presidential elections===
In April 2004, PKB received 10.6% of the vote in the national legislative election and nominated Abdurrahman as their presidential candidate, but after failing the medical examination required by Indonesian law, Abdurrahman&#x27;s candidature was disqualified. Abdurrahman then threw his support behind Wiranto of the Golkar party, as Abdurrahman&#x27;s brother, Salahuddin, was Wiranto&#x27;s running mate. Wiranto and Salahuddin came third. For the run-off elections, held on 20 September 2004 between candidates Yudhoyono and Megawati, Abdurrahman Wahid declared no support for either candidate and abstained from voting.

===Opposition to Yudhoyono government===
In August 2005, Abdurrahman Wahid became one of the leaders of a political coalition called the United and Awakened Archipelago Coalition (). Along with Try Sutrisno, Wiranto, Akbar Tanjung, and Megawati Sukarnoputri, this coalition criticized the policies of the Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono government, specifically about the withdrawal of fuel subsidies, which they argued would raise the price of fuel.

In September 2006, Abdurrahman Wahid said that he would run in the 2009 presidential election He confirmed this in March 2008, at a rally of his National Awakening Party (PKB) in Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan.

===Philanthropic activities===
The Abdurrahman Wahid Institute is a Jakarta-based nonprofit organization founded by Abdurrahman in 2004, now led by his daughter, Yenni Abdurrahman.

Abdurrahman Wahid served as patron, member of the board of directors and senior advisor to the LibForAll (&quot;Liberty for All&quot;) Foundation, whose mission it is to reduce religious extremism and discredit terrorism worldwide.

Abdurrahman Wahid wrote an article published in the Wall Street Journal on 30 December 2005 entitled &quot;Right Islam vs. Wrong Islam&quot; in which he called on &quot;people of good will of every faith and nation&quot; to unite against the religious hatred that underlies and animates terrorism.

Abdurrahman Wahid discussed his suspicions regarding the involvement of the Indonesian government and Indonesia&#x27;s armed forces in the terrorist bombings on Bali, in an interview in the documentary &quot;Inside Indonesia&#x27;s War on Terrorism&quot;, aired by SBS Dateline on 12 October 2005.

===Religious views===
Abdurrahman Wahid said:
In a 2009 dialogue with Buddhist leader Daisaku Ikeda, Abdurrahman Wahid said:
In a 2002 interview with Australian television program, &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot;, Abdurrahman Wahid explained his respect for Israel and posed a challenging &quot;correction&quot; to be addressed by his fellow Muslims:
Abdurrahman Wahid was an advocate of interfaith dialogue and sat on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute.

===Illness and death===

In late December 2009, despite poor health and a recent hospital visit, Abdurrahman asked to be taken to visit Rembang and Jombang. During the trip his health worsened and Abdurrahman was admitted to hospital in Jombang on 24 December 2009. He was moved to Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Central Jakarta the following day to undergo dialysis. He also underwent dental surgery on 28 December after complaining of toothache. Abdurrahman died on 30 December at approximately 6:45 pm local time (UTC+7) due to complications from kidney disorders, heart disease and diabetes. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono visited Abdurrahman shortly before his death. A state funeral was held for Abdurrahman on 31 December, and flags were flown at half-staff for seven days. He was buried next to his grandparents and parents at his birthplace, Jombang.

==Legacy==
When Wahid first came to power in Indonesia, there were concerns about the direction of Indonesia&#x27;s foreign policy. But in reality, Wahid&#x27;s foreign policy was more &quot;orthodox&quot; than his previous rhetoric. Indonesia has succeeded in getting international assurances of its territorial integrity. ASEAN also remains central to Jakarta&#x27;s foreign policy views. The East Timor issue remains a crucial issue between Indonesia and a number of Western countries. The United States, in particular, was reluctant to push Indonesia too far because it believed that a Wahid presidency was the least desirable alternative in both domestic and foreign policy.

During his reign, Wahid was known for his visionary thinking and his policies made him one of the most controversial figures of his time. His influence on the &quot;Reformasi&quot; included greater freedom of the press, marked by the dissolution of the Ministry of Information in 1999. His policies defended minority rights and he personally made decisions that were considered erratic. During his reign, Chinese Indonesians were allowed to celebrate Chinese New Year and were considered to have been freed from the oppression they had felt for a long time. Because of that, he was also named &quot;Father of Chinese&quot; by several Chinese figures. As a cleric, he was respected not only by his followers, but also by adherents of other religions and even atheists. The photo of him waving to his supporters on the veranda of Merdeka Palace after being impeached is one of the most phenomenal photos in Indonesian history. Because of his thoughts and government supporting minority rights, he was given the title “Father of Pluralism”. His famous line, &quot;Gitu aja kok repot&quot; (), has become an icon in political talk shows in Indonesia. The line shows how he can easily solve problems even though his decisions have angered others.

In August 2021, Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs, Mahfud MD, made a statement on Abdurrahman Wahid&#x27;s Impeachment. In Mahfud&#x27;s statement which he said on the Nahdlatul Ulama YouTube Channel, stated that Wahid&#x27;s impeachment was unconstitutional and an unlawful action. Mahfud MD stated that the impeachment of Wahid in 2001 was not in accordance to the Resolutions of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (Indonesian: Ketetapan Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat) No.III of 1978 about the Position and Work System of the Highest State Institution with/or State High Institutions. Mahfud also expressed that the impeachment by the Special Session of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly has different cases between memorandums I, II, and III.

On 25 September 2024, the MPR officially revoked MPR Resolution No. II/MPR/2001 that was used as an instrument to revoke Wahid from presidency and also restored his reputation posthumously. On the same day, the MPR also vindicated Suharto by partial revocation of MPR Resolution No. XI/MPR/1998. These revocations also paved their way to attain National Hero status.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and children===
Abdurrahman Wahid was married to Sinta Nuriyah with whom he had four daughters: Alissa Qotrunnada Munawaroh, Zannuba Arifah Chafsoh (popularly known as Yenny Wahid), Annita Hayatunnufus, and Inayah Wulandari.

===Health issues===
Abdurrahman Wahid was visually impaired throughout his presidency, although many claimed that he was able to see without assistance. Nevertheless, during his inauguration as president, he was helped by an army officer who acted as an assistant by re-reading the text of presidential oath during his inauguration. His eyesight began to deteriorate due to glaucoma since 1985, and worsened by an accident where he was hit by a car which resulted in the loss of a retina. Consequently, he was helped by some trusted assistants who acted as his &quot;eyes&quot;. He was also alleged to have sleeping disorder as he was sometimes caught sleeping during important cabinet meetings.

==Honours==
*In 1993, Abdurrahman Wahid received the prestigious Magsaysay Award for his efforts to promote inter-religious relations in Indonesia within a democratic society. The award is often referred to as &#x27;Asia&#x27;s Nobel Prize.&#x27;
*He was conferred honorary doctorates by the Netanya University (Israel), Konkuk and Sun Moon University (South Korea), Soka Gakkai University (Japan), Thammasat University (Thailand), Pantheon-Sorbonne University (France), and many other universities around the world.

<text>Literature of Kashmir has a long history, the oldest texts having been composed in the Sanskrit language. Early names include Patanjali, the author of the &quot;Mahābhāṣya&quot; commentary on Pāṇini&#x27;s grammar, suggested by some to have been the same to write the Hindu treatise known as the &quot;Yogasutra&quot;, and Dridhbala, who revised the &quot;Charaka Samhita&quot; of &quot;Ayurveda&quot;.

In medieval times, philosophers of Kashmir Shaivism include Vasugupta (c. 800), Utpala (c. 925), Abhinavagupta, Kshemaraja, and Anandavardhana. Within contemporary Kashmir literature there are many poets, including Asif Tariq Bhat Tashi Shah, Akeel Mohiuddin Bhat, and Zeeshan Jaipuri.

== Kashmiri language literature ==

The below listed table marks Kashmiri language poets in chronological order as per the book— &quot;A History of Kashmiri literature&quot; by Trilokinath Raina.
The use of the Kashmiri language began with the work &quot;Mahānaya-Prakāsha&quot; by Rājānaka Shiti Kantha (c.1250), and was followed by the poet Lalleshvari or Lal Ded (14th century), who wrote mystical verses in the &quot;vaakh&quot; or four-line couplet style. Another mystic of her time equally revered in Kashmir and popularly known as Nund Reshi wrote powerful poetry. Later came Habba Khatun (16th century) with her own style. Other major names are Rupa Bhavani (1621–1721), Paramananda (1791–1864), Arnimal (d. 1800), Mahmud Gami (1765–1855), Rasul Mir (d. 1870), Maqbool Shah Kralawari (1820–1877). Also, the Sufi poets like Shamas Faqir, Wahab Khar, Soch Kral, Samad Mir, and Ahad Zargar. Among modern poets are Ghulam Ahmad Mahjoor (1885–1952), Abdul Ahad Azad (1903–1948), and Zinda Kaul (1884–1965).

During the 1950s, a number of well educated youth turned to Kashmiri writing, both poetry and prose, and enriched modern Kashmiri writing by leaps and bounds. Among these writers are Dinanath Nadim (1916–1988), Amin Kamil (1923–2014), Sarwanand Kaol Premi (1924–1990), Rehman Rahi (born 1925), Ghulam Nabi Firaq (1927–2016), Ali Mohammed Lone (1928–1987), Akhtar Mohiuddin (1928–2001), Ali Mohammad Shahbaz, Avtar Krishen Rahbar (born 1933), Sajood Sailani, Som Nath Zutshi, Muzaffar Aazim. Some later day writers are Hari Kishan Kaul, Majrooh Rashid, Rattanlal Shant, Hirdhey Kaul Bharti, Omkar N Koul, Roop Krishen Bhat, Rafiq Raaz, Tariq Shehraz, Shafi Shauq, Showkat Shehri, M.H Zaffar, G.M Azad, Anis Hamdani, Barkat Nida, Shafi Sumbli, Bashar Bashir, Shenaz Rashid, Shabir Ahmad Shabir, Shabir Magami, Tariq Ahmad Tariq, and Moti Lal Kemmu.

Contemporary Kashmiri literature appears in such magazines as &quot;Sheeraza&quot; published by the Jammu &amp; Kashmir Academy of Art, Culture and Languages, &quot;Anhar&quot; published by the Kashmiri Department of the Kashmir University, and an independent magazines/portals like &quot;The Kashmir Tales&quot;. &quot;Mountain Ink&quot;, Inverse Journal &quot;Neab International Kashmiri Magazine&quot; published from Boston, &quot;Vaakh&quot; (published by All India Kashmiri Samaj, Delhi) and &quot;Koshur Samachar&quot; (published by Kashmiri Sahayak Sammiti, Delhi).

==Writers in Persian==

After Sanskrit and before the coming Urdu, because of the adoration and patronising policy of Persian culture by the Mughals, Persian became the literary language also of the region. Kashmir was very richly represented in that tradition, as already before the end of the 18th century &quot;Muhammad Aslah&#x27;s tazkira of the Persian-writing poets of Kashmir, written during the reign of the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah (1131-61/1719-48), alone lists 303 poets&quot;. Late scholar from Pakistan, Pir Hassam-ud-Din Rashidi, edited, translated, and enlarged this work later, and had it published by the Iqbal Academy.

The most famous of them was Muhammad Tahir Ghani (d. 1669), better known as Gani Kashmiri, whose poetry was recently translated into English, for the first time, by Mufti Mudasir Farooqi and Nusrat Bazaz as &#x27;The Captured Gazelle&#x27; in the world-renowned Penguin Classics list. Ghani influenced many generations of Persian-and Urdu writing poets in South Asia including Mir Taqi Mir, Ghalib and most importantly, Iqbal. Ghani&#x27;s &quot;forte&quot; lies in creating delightful poetic images, usually by stating an abstract idea in the first hemistich and following it up with a concrete exemplification in the other. He also stands out for his multi-layered poems, which exploit the double meaning of words.

Another name in the field of Persian-language writers from Kashmir is Shaykh Yaqub Sarfi Kashmiri (1521-1595), a 16th-century Sufi poet-philosopher who was internationally acknowledged and who had for students, amongst others, well-known religious scholar Ahmad Sirhindi (more particularly, he taught him hadith) and Persian-language poet Mohsin Fani Kashmiri (d. 1671 or 1672) (himself the teacher of Ghani Kashmiri and author of the pivotal work of comparative religion, the Dabestan-e Mazaheb).

Other of the well-known and influential Persian-language poets of Kashmir would include 

* Habibullah Nowshehri (1556-1617)
*Mirza Dirab Big Juya (d. 1707)
*Gani Kashmiri (1630–1669)
*Mirza Beg Akmal Kamil (1645-1719)
*Muhammad Aslam Salim (d. 1718)
*Mulla Muhammad Taufiq (1765)
*Muhammed Azam Didamari (d. 1765)
*Mulla Muhammad Hamid (1848)
*Birbal Kachru Varasta (d. 1865)
*Pandit Taba Ram Turki (1776–1847), who was a celebrity as far as Central Asia.

==Writers in Urdu==

Despite being a numerically small community, the Kashmiri Pandits are influential in their contribution to Urdu literature. One important early example is Daya Shankar Kaul Nasim (1811–1845), a renowned Urdu poet of the 19th century, and hundreds of others followed his path.

Some eminent Urdu literary personalities of Kashmiri origins (from both the Valley and the diaspora) include (in chronological order):

He was called &quot;khan-e-allama&quot; (the Scholarly Khan) due to his deep scholarship on many subjects but is best known today for having translated Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica from Latin into Arabic.
*Mufti Sadruddin Khan &#x27;Azurda&#x27;, 1789–1868, apart from being the Grand Mufti of Delhi, he was also a personal friend to Ghalib (whose own mother was from Kashmir) and himself a poet of note in Urdu as well as in Arabic and Persian. He also wrote a &quot;tazkira&quot; (biographical anthology of poets).

<text>Lalleshwari, ( also commonly known as Lal Ded (), was a Kashmiri mystic of the Kashmir Shaivism school of Hindu philosophy. She was the creator of the style of mystic poetry called vatsun or &quot;Vakhs&quot;, meaning &quot;speech&quot; (from Sanskrit &quot;vāc&quot;). Known as Lal Vakhs, her verses are among the early compositions in the Kashmiri language and are a part in the history of modern Kashmiri literature. 

Lalleshwari (&quot;Mother Lal&quot; or &quot;Mother Lalla&quot;) is also known by various other names, including Lal Dyad (&quot;Dyad&quot; means &quot;Grandmother&quot;), Lalla Aarifa, Lal Diddi, Lalleshwari, Lalla Yogishwari/Yogeshwari and Lalishri.

== Life ==
Most modern scholars place Lalleshwari&#x27;s birth between 1301 and 1320 C.E., near Sempore or Pandrenthan. She is estimated to have died in 1373, and a grave near Bijbehara is attributed to her, although there is no confirmation. Lalleshwari is believed to have been born to a Brahmin family, and was married at the age of twelve in accordance with the local customs. Following her marriage, she was renamed, as is custom, to Padmavati, but continued to be known as Lalla or Lalleshwari. Some reports suggest her marriage was unhappy, and that she left home, between the ages of twenty-four and twenty-six, to become a disciple of a spiritual leader, Siddha Srikanth or Sed Boyu, who was a Shaivite. As part of her religious education, she travelled alone on foot, surviving on alms, before becoming a teacher and spiritual leader herself.

Records of Lalleshwari&#x27;s life are contained in oral tradition, and consequently there is variance on the details of her life and beliefs. Numerous contemporary Kashmiri histories, such as those prepared by Jonaraja, Srivara, Prajyabhatta, and Haidar Malik Chadura, do not mention Lalleshwari. The first written record of Lalleshwari&#x27;s life is contained in the &quot;Tadhkirat-ul-Arifin&quot; (1587), a collection of biographies of saints and religious figures written by Mulla Ali Raina, and followed by an account of her life in Baba Daud Mishkati&#x27;s Asrar ul-Akbar (1654). In these texts, Lalleshwari is described as a mystic saint, appearing in the forest to travellers. In 1736, Khwaja Azam Diddamari&#x27;s &quot;Tarikh-i-Azami&quot; contained a more detailed account of Lalleshwari&#x27;s life. She is also noted in a Persian chronicle, the &quot;Waqiati-e-Kashmir&quot; (1746) in which she is described as being known in the reign of Sultan Alau-ud-din (1343–54) and died in the reign of Sultan Shihab-ud-din (1354–73).

Lalleshwari is also believed to be a contemporary of Mir Sayyid Ali-Hamdani, an Iranian Sufi scholar and poet, who recorded stories of her in his own verse during his travels to Kashmir.

== Literary works ==
Lalleshwari&#x27;s poems represent some of the early works of Kashmiri literature, and were written as Kashmiri began to emerge as a distinct language from Apabhramsa-prakrit, which was spoken in North India. A total of 285 poems, known as &quot;vakhs,&quot; are attributed to Lalleshwari.

Lalleshwari&#x27;s &quot;vakhs&quot; drawn from influences and languages that made contact with the Indian sub-continent in her life, drawing from Sanskritic, Islamic and Sufi cultures.

=== Translations ===
Lalleshwari&#x27;s work were first recorded in writing in the twentieth century, and have been republished since, in Kashmiri as well as in translation. In 1914, Sir George Grierson, a civil servant and the Superintendent of the Linguistic Survey of India, commissioned a copy of Lalleshwari&#x27;s &quot;vakhs&quot;. A written record of the &quot;vakhs&quot; was unavailable at the time, and one was prepared by transcribing an oral narration of the &quot;vakhs&quot; performed by Dharma-dasa Darwesh, a story-teller residing in Gush, Kashmir. This manuscript was translated in English by Grierson and published as &quot;Lalla-Vakyani&quot;, or &quot;The Wise Sayings of Lal Ded&quot;. Grierson consolidated and expanded on the partial translation prepared by the Hungarian-British archaeologist and scholar Sir Marc Aurel Stein, and incorporated some archived poems that were contained in the &quot;Dictionary of Kashmiri Proverbs and Sayings&quot; (1888).

Grierson&#x27;s translation was the first printed and published volume of Lalleshwari&#x27;s works. Following his translation, a number of English translations have been produced, those by Pandit Ananda Koul (1921), Sir Richard Carnac Temple (1924) and Jaylal Kaul (1973). Recent translations include those by Coleman Barks, Jaishree Odin Kak, and Ranjit Hoskote.

Her poems, (&quot;vakhs&quot;) have been translated into English by Richard Temple, Jaylal Kaul, Coleman Barks, Jaishree Odin, and Ranjit Hoskote.
== Legacy ==
The leading Kashmiri Sufi figure Sheikh Noor-ud-din Wali (also known as Nooruddin Rishi or Nunda Rishi) was influenced by Lalleshwari. He led to the formation of the Rishi order of saints and later gave rise to many Rishi saints like Resh Mir Sàeb. One Kashmiri folk story recounts that, as a baby, Nunda Rishi refused to be breast-fed by his mother. It was Lalleshwari who breast-fed him.

Lalleshwari and her mystic musings continue to have a deep impact on the psyche of Kashmiris, and the 2000 National Seminar on her held at New Delhi led to the release of the book &quot;Remembering Lal Ded in Modern Times&quot;. In his book &quot;Triadic Mysticism&quot;, Paul E. Murphy calls her the &quot;chief exponent of devotional or emotion-oriented Triadism&quot;. According to him, three representatives of devotionalism emerged in Kashmir in the five hundred years between the last half of the ninth and the end of the fourteenth centuries.

What this points to is the non-sectarian nature of Lalleshwari&#x27;s spiritual life and her song-poems. Yet, her life and work have been used for various religious and political agendas over time. As author and poet Ranjit Hoskote writes:

Beyond several new translations of Lalleshwari&#x27;s vakh, there are other contemporary performative arts that are based on Lalleshwari&#x27;s life and poetry. For example, there are contemporary renderings of Lalleshwari&#x27;s poetry in song. In addition, a solo play in English, Hindi, and Kashmiri titled &quot;Lal Ded&quot; (based on her life) has been performed by actress Mita Vashisht across India since 2004.

<text>Elizabeth Williams ( Smyth; 22 May 1943 – 17 March 2020) was a peace activist from Northern Ireland. She was a co-recipient with Mairead Corrigan of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976 for her work as a cofounder of Community of Peace People, an organisation dedicated to promoting a peaceful resolution to the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

Williams headed the Global Children&#x27;s Foundation and was the President of the World Centre of Compassion for Children International. She was also the Chair of Institute for Asian Democracy in Washington D.C. She lectured widely on topics of peace, education, inter-cultural and inter-faith understanding, anti-extremism, and children&#x27;s rights.

Williams was a founding member of the Nobel Laureate Summit, which has taken place annually since 2000.

In 2006, Williams became a founder of the Nobel Women&#x27;s Initiative along with Nobel Peace Laureates Mairead Corrigan Maguire, Shirin Ebadi, Wangari Maathai, Jody Williams and Rigoberta Menchú Tum. These six women, representing North and South America, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, brought together their experiences in a united effort for peace with justice and equality. It is the goal of the Nobel Women&#x27;s Initiative to help strengthen work being done in support of women&#x27;s rights around the world. Williams was also a member of PeaceJam.

==Early life==
Williams was born on 22 May 1943 in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Her father worked as a butcher and her mother was a housewife. Betty received her primary education from St. Teresa Primary School in Belfast and attended St Dominic&#x27;s Grammar School for Girls for her secondary school studies. Upon completing her formal education, she took up a job of office receptionist.

Rare for the time in Northern Ireland, her father was Protestant and her mother was Catholic; a family background from which Williams later said she derived religious tolerance and a breadth of vision that motivated her to work for peace. Early in the 1970s she joined an anti-violence campaign headed by a Protestant priest. Williams credited this experience for preparing her to eventually found her own peace movement, which focused on creating peace groups composed of former opponents, practicing confidence-building measures, and the development of a grassroots peace process.

==Peace petition==

Williams was drawn into the public arena after witnessing the death of three children on 10 August 1976, when they were hit by a car whose driver, an Irish Republican Army (IRA) paramilitary named Danny Lennon, had been fatally shot in return fire by a soldier of the Kings Own Royal Border regiment. As she turned the corner to her home, she saw the three Maguire children crushed by the swerving car and rushed to help. Their mother, Anne Maguire, who was with the children, died by suicide in January 1980.

Williams was so moved by the incident that within two days of the tragic event, she had obtained 6,000 signatures on a petition for peace and gained wide media attention. With Corrigan, she co-founded the Women for Peace; which, with Ciaran McKeown, later became the Community of Peace People.

Williams soon organised a peace march to the graves of the slain children, which was attended by 10,000 Protestant and Catholic women. However, the peaceful march was violently disrupted by members of the IRA, who accused them of being &quot;dupes of the British&quot;. The following week, Williams led another march in Ormeau Park that concluded successfully without incident – this time with 20,000 participants.

At that time, Williams declared the following:

===Declaration of the Peace People===
First Declaration of the Peace People
*We have a simple message to the world from this movement for Peace.
*We want to live and love and build a just and peaceful society.
*We want for our children, as we want for ourselves, our lives at home, at work, and at play to be lives of joy and Peace.
*We recognise that to build such a society demands dedication, hard work, and courage.
*We recognise that there are many problems in our society which are a source of conflict and violence.
*We recognise that every bullet fired and every exploding bomb make that work more difficult.
*We reject the use of the bomb and the bullet and all the techniques of violence.
*We dedicate ourselves to working with our neighbours, near and far, day in and day out, to build that peaceful society in which the tragedies we have known are a bad memory and a continuing warning.

==Nobel Peace Prize==

In recognition of her efforts for peace, Williams, together with her friend Mairead Corrigan, became joint recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977 (the prize for 1976). In her acceptance speech, Williams said, That first week will always be remembered of course for something else besides the birth of the Peace People. For those most closely involved, the most powerful memory of that week was the death of a young republican and the deaths of three children struck by the dead man&#x27;s car. A deep sense of frustration at the mindless stupidity of the continuing violence was already evident before the tragic events of that sunny afternoon of 10 August 1976. But the deaths of those four young people in one terrible moment of violence caused that frustration to explode, and create the possibility of a real peace movement...As far as we are concerned, every single death in the last eight years, and every death in every war that was ever fought represents life needlessly wasted, a mother&#x27;s labour spurned.

The Peace Prize money was divided equally between Williams and Corrigan. Williams kept her share of the money, stating that her intention was to use it to promote peace beyond Ireland, but faced criticism for her decision. She and Corrigan had no contact after 1976. In 1978 Williams broke off links with the Peace People movement, and became instead an activist for peace in other areas around the world.

==Other awards==
Williams received the People&#x27;s Peace Prize of Norway in 1976, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1977, the Schweitzer Medallion for Courage, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Award, the Eleanor Roosevelt Award in 1984, and the Frank Foundation Child Care International Oliver Award. In 1995, she was awarded the Rotary International &quot;Paul Harris Fellowship&quot; and the Together for Peace Building Award.

==Talks and guest lectures==

At the 2006 Earth Dialogues forum in Brisbane, Williams told an audience of schoolchildren during a speech on Iraq War casualties that &quot;Right now, I would like to kill George W. Bush.&quot; From 17 to 20 September 2007, Williams gave a series of lectures in Southern California: on 18 September, she presented a lecture to the academic community of Orange County entitled &quot;Peace in the World Is Everybody&#x27;s Business&quot;; and on 20 September she gave a lecture to 2,232 members of the general public, including 1,100 high school sophomores, at Soka University of America. In 2010, she gave a lecture at WE Day Toronto, a WE Charity event that empowers students to be active within their communities, and worldwide.

Speaking at the University of Bradford before an audience of 200 in March 2011, Williams warned that young Muslim women on campus were vulnerable to attacks from angry family members, while the university does little to help protect them. &quot;If you had someone on this campus these young women could go to say, &#x27;I am frightened&#x27; – if you are not doing that here, you are dehumanising them by not helping these young women, don&#x27;t you think?&quot;

==Personal life==
At the time she received the Nobel Prize, Williams worked as a receptionist and was raising her two children with her first husband Ralph Williams. This marriage was dissolved in 1981. She married businessman James Perkins in December 1982; they lived in Florida in the United States.

In 2004, she returned to live in Northern Ireland. Williams died on 17 March 2020, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, at the age of 76 in Belfast.

==In popular culture==
*Williams was honoured/featured in the music video of Nickelback&#x27;s hit song &quot;If Everyone Cared&quot;.
*Williams and Mairead Corrigan were the subject of a French song, &quot;Deux Femmes à Dublin&quot;, sung by French Pied-Noir singer Enrico Macias.

<text>Jaishree Odin is a literary scholar who is the director and a professor of the Program of Interdisciplinary Studies at the University of Hawaiʻi. Her research relates to cultural studies of science and technology, literary and political ecology, ecology and ethics, system&#x27;s ecology, and eco-literacy. Her work ranges from German philosophy and the feminist angle to mysticism. She has also considered the current relevance of Shaivite theories of higher consciousness.

Jaishree is sister of computer scientists Avinash Kak and Subhash Kak. 

==Education and career==
Odin obtained a Master of Science degree in chemistry from India, following which she went on to earn a doctorate in comparative literature from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Odin teaches in the Liberal Studies program at the University of Hawaii. Besides, she is the director of a Sloan foundation-funded online distance learning project at the university, which is intended to increase access to higher education in the state of Hawaii. 

==Works==
===Translations===
She is one of the translators of Lalleshvari, the famed 14th century Kashmiri mystic and poet. She has also translated Kashmir&#x27;s early Sufi poetry, especially that of Nunda Reshi. Odin&#x27;s essays have been published in &quot;Commonwealth Studies&quot; and in the collection &quot;Postcolonialism and American Ethnicity&quot;.

Odin wrote &quot;To the Other Shore: Lalla&#x27;s Life and Poetry&quot; (Vitasta Pub, 1999).

Odin&#x27;s work includes &quot;Through the Looking Glass: Technology, Nomadology and Postmodern Narrative&quot; which the Electronic Literature State of the Arts Symposium describes as a critical exploration of shattered visual metaphors in contemporary literature which includes electronic literary forms. 

Odin has written extensively on technology-mediated narrative forms as well as the role of technology in re-visioning higher education. Some of her published articles on electronic literature have dealt with the potential of the electronic media in depicting contemporary experience in multiple ways. Ponzanesi and Koen claim: &quot;As Jaishree Odin has so aptly written, both the hypertext and the postcolonial are discourses are characterized by multivocality, multilinearity, open-endedness, active encounter and traversal. Both disrupt chronological sequences and spatial ordering (1997), allowing for a contestation of master narratives and the creation of subaltern positioning.&quot;

<text>Arius (; ; 250 or 256 – 336) was a Cyrenaic presbyter and ascetic. He has been regarded as the founder of Arianism, which holds that Jesus Christ was not coeternal with God the Father, but was rather created before time. Arian theology and its doctrine regarding the nature of the Godhead showed a belief in radical subordinationism, a view notably disputed by 4th century figures such as Athanasius of Alexandria.

Constantine the Great&#x27;s formal decriminalization of Christianity into the Roman Empire entailed the convention of ecumenical councils to remove theological divisions between opposing sects within the Church. Arius&#x27;s theology was a prominent topic at the First Council of Nicaea, where Arianism was condemned in favor of Homoousian conceptions of God and Jesus. Opposition to Arianism remains embodied in the Nicene Creed, described as &quot;a deliberately anti-Arian document.&quot; Nevertheless, despite concerted opposition, Arian churches persisted for centuries throughout Europe (especially in various Germanic kingdoms), the Middle East, and North Africa. They were suppressed by military conquest or by voluntary royal conversion between the fifth and seventh centuries.

Arius&#x27;s role as the sole originator of Arian theology has been disputed by historians such as Rowan Williams, who stated that &quot;Arius&#x27; role in &#x27;Arianism&#x27; was not that of the founder of a sect. It was not his individual teaching that dominated the mid-century eastern Church.&quot; Richard Hanson writes that Arius&#x27; specific espousal of subordinationist theology brought &quot;into unavoidable prominence a doctrinal crisis which had gradually been gathering[...] He was the spark that started the explosion. But in himself he was of no great significance.&quot; The association between Arius and the theology titled after him has been argued to be a creation &quot;based on the polemic of Nicene writers&quot; such as Athanasius of Alexandria, a Homoousian.

== Early life and personality ==

Reconstructing the life and doctrine of Arius has proven to be a difficult task.

Arius was of Berber descent. His father&#x27;s name is given as Ammonius.

Hanson says that &quot;Arius very probably had at some time studied with Lucian of Antioch&quot; because he refers to somebody else as &quot;truly a &quot;fellow&quot;-disciple of Lucian.&quot; But Williams questions whether &quot;we should assume from the one word in Arius&#x27; letter that he had actually been Lucian&#x27;s student.&quot;

In the past, many writers have assumed that our Arius is the same as the Arius who was involved in the Melitian schism, &quot;who had an outward appearance of piety, and ... was eager to be a teacher.&quot; However, after several pages of detailed analysis, Williams concludes that &quot;the Melitian Arius ... melt(s) away under close investigation.&quot;

In 313, Arius was made presbyter of the Baucalis district in Alexandria.

Arius&#x27; views have always been &quot;represented as ... some hopelessly defective form of belief.&quot; Contrary to this view, Rowan Williams recently concluded that Arius is &quot;a thinker and exegete of resourcefulness, sharpness and originality.&quot;

Although his character has been severely assailed by his opponents, Arius appears to have been a man of personal ascetic achievement, pure morals, and decided convictions.&quot;He was very tall in stature, with downcast countenance ... always garbed in a short cloak and sleeveless tunic&quot;;&quot; he spoke gently, and people found him persuasive and flattering.&quot;It is traditional to claim that Arius was a deliberate radical, breaking away from the &#x27;orthodoxy&#x27; of the church fathers. However:&quot;A great deal of recent work seeking to understand Arian spirituality has, not surprisingly, helped to demolish the notion of Arius and his supporters as deliberate radicals, attacking a time-honoured tradition.&quot;

&quot;Arius was a committed theological conservative; more specifically, a conservative Alexandrian.&quot;

== Arius&#x27; writings ==
Very little of Arius&#x27; writing has survived. &quot;As far as his own writings go, we have no more than three letters, (and) a few fragments of another.&quot; The three are:

# The confession of faith Arius presented to Alexander of Alexandria,
# His letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia, and
# The confession he submitted to the emperor.&quot;

&quot;The Thalia is Arius&#x27; only known theological work&quot; but &quot;we do not possess a single complete and continuous text.&quot; We only have extracts from it in the writings of Arius&#x27; enemies, &quot;mostly from the pen of Athanasius of Alexandria, his bitterest and most prejudiced enemy.&quot;

Emperor Constantine ordered their burning while Arius was still living but R.P.C. Hanson concluded that so little survived because &quot;the people of his day, whether they agreed with him or not, did not regard him (Arius) as a particularly significant writer.&quot;

Those works which have survived are quoted in the works of churchmen who denounced him as a heretic. This leads some—but not all—scholars to question their reliability. For example Bishop R.P.C. Hanson wrote:&quot;Athanasius, a fierce opponent of Arius ... certainly would not have stopped short of &quot;misrepresenting&quot; what he said.&quot; &quot;Athanasius... may be suspected of pressing the words &quot;maliciously&quot; rather further than Arius intended.&quot;Archbishop Rowan Williams agrees that Athanasius applied &quot;unscrupulous tactics in polemic and struggle.&quot;

== Arian controversy ==
=== Beginnings ===

The Diocletianic Persecution (Great Persecution) of AD 303–313 was Rome&#x27;s final attempt to limit the expansion of Christianity across the empire. That persecution came to an end when Christianity was legalized with Galerius&#x27; Edict of Toleration in 311 followed by Constantine&#x27;s Edict of Milan in 313, after Emperor Constantine himself had become a Christian. The Arian Controversy began only 5 years later in 318 when Arius, who was in charge of one of the churches in Alexandria, publicly criticized his bishop Alexander for &quot;carelessness in blurring the distinction of nature between the Father and the Son by his emphasis on eternal generation&quot;.

The Trinitarian historian Socrates of Constantinople reports that Arius sparked the controversy that bears his name when Alexander of Alexandria, who had succeeded Achillas as the Bishop of Alexandria, gave a sermon stating the similarity of the Son to the Father. Arius interpreted Alexander&#x27;s speech as being a revival of Sabellianism, condemned it, and then argued that &quot;if the Father begat the Son, he that was begotten had a beginning of existence: and from this it is evident, that there was a time when the Son was not. It therefore necessarily follows, that he [the Son] had his substance from nothing.&quot; This quote describes the essence of Arius&#x27;s doctrine.

Socrates of Constantinople believed that Arius was influenced in his thinking by the teachings of Lucian of Antioch, a celebrated Christian teacher and martyr. In a letter to Patriarch Alexander of Constantinople Arius&#x27;s bishop, Alexander of Alexandria, wrote that Arius derived his theology from Lucian. The express purpose of the letter was to complain about the doctrines that Arius was spreading, but his charge of heresy against Arius is vague and unsupported by other authorities. Furthermore, Alexander&#x27;s language, like that of most controversialists in those days, is quite bitter and abusive. Moreover, even Alexander never accused Lucian of having taught Arianism.

=== Supporters ===
It is traditionally taught that Arius had wide support in the areas of the Roman Empire. But it now seems his supporters were limited to Egypt and Alexandria:The controversy had spread from Alexandria into almost all the African regions and was considered a disturbance of the public order by the Roman Empire. (Eusebius of Caesarea in The Life of Constantine).

&quot;The &quot;Thalia&quot; appears ... to have circulated only in Alexandria; what is known of him elsewhere seems to stem from Athanasius&#x27; quotations.&quot;He also had the support of perhaps the two most important church leaders of that time:

=== Eusebius of Nicomedia ===
Eusebius of Nicomedia &quot;was a supporter of Arius as long as Arius lived.&quot; &quot;The conventional picture of Eusebius is of an unscrupulous intriguer.&quot; &quot;This is of course because our knowledge of Eusebius derives almost entirely from the evidence of his bitter enemies.&quot; Hanson mentions several instances displaying Eusebius&#x27; integrity and courage and concludes:&quot;Eusebius certainly was a man of strong character and great ability&quot; (page 29). &quot;It was he who virtually took charge of the affairs of the Greek speaking Eastern Church from 328 until his death&quot; (page 29). He encouraged the spread of the Christian faith beyond the frontiers of the Roman Empire. The version of the Christian faith which the missionaries spread was that favoured by Eusebius and not Athanasius. This serves as evidence of his zeal.&quot;

=== Eusebius of Caesarea ===
&quot;Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea in Palestine [the church historian] was certainly an early supporter of Arius.&quot; &quot;He was universally acknowledged to be the most scholarly bishop of his day.&quot; &quot;Eusebius of Caesarea ... was one of the most influential authors of the fourth century.&quot; &quot;Neither Arius nor anti-Arians speak evil of him.&quot; &quot;He was made bishop of Caesarea about 313, (and) attended the Council of Nicaea in 325.&quot;

&quot;We cannot accordingly describe Eusebius (of Caesarea) as a formal Arian in the sense that he knew and accepted the full logic of Arius, or of Asterius&#x27; position. But undoubtedly, he approached it nearly.&quot;

=== Origen and Arius ===

Like many third-century Christian scholars, Arius was influenced by the writings of Origen, widely regarded as the first great theologian of Christianity. However, while both agreed on the subordination of the Son to the Father, and Arius drew support from Origen&#x27;s theories on the &quot;Logos&quot;, the two did not agree on everything. For example:

* Hanson refers several times to Origen&#x27;s teaching that the Son always existed, for example, &quot;Origen&#x27;s doctrine of the &quot;eternal generation&quot; of the Son by the Father.&quot; To contrast this with what Arius taught, Hanson states that Arius taught that &#x27;there was a time when he did not exist&#x27;.&quot;
* &quot;Arius in the &quot;Thalia&quot; sees the Son as praising the Father in heaven; Origen generally avoids language suggesting that the Son &quot;worships&quot; the Father as God.&quot;

Hanson concluded:&quot;Arius probably inherited some terms and even some ideas from Origen, ... he certainly did not adopt any large or significant part of Origen&#x27;s theology.&quot; &quot;He was not without influence from Origen, but cannot seriously be called an Origenist.&quot;However, because Origen&#x27;s theological speculations were often proffered to stimulate further inquiry rather than to put an end to any given dispute, both Arius and his opponents were able to invoke the authority of this revered (at the time) theologian during their debate.

=== Divine but not fully divine ===
Arius emphasized the supremacy and uniqueness of God the Father, meaning that the Father alone is infinite and eternal and almighty, and that therefore the Father&#x27;s divinity must be greater than the Son&#x27;s. Arius maintained that the Son possessed neither the eternity nor the true divinity of the Father but was rather made &quot;God&quot; only by the Father&#x27;s permission and power.

&quot;Many summary accounts present the Arian controversy as a dispute over whether or not Christ was divine.&quot; &quot;It is misleading to assume that these controversies were about &#x27;the divinity of Christ&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Many fourth-century theologians (including some who were in no way anti-Nicene) made distinctions between being &#x27;God&#x27; and being &#x27;true God&#x27; that belie any simple account of the controversy in these terms.&quot;

&quot;It must be understood that in the fourth century the word &#x27;God&#x27; &quot;(theos, deus)&quot; had not acquired the significance which in our twentieth-century world it has acquired ... viz. the one and sole true God. The word could apply to many gradations of divinity and was not as absolute to Athanasius as it is to us.&quot;

=== Initial responses ===

The Bishop of Alexandria exiled the presbyter following a council of local priests. Arius&#x27;s supporters vehemently protested. Numerous bishops and Christian leaders of the era supported his cause, among them Eusebius of Nicomedia, who baptized Constantine the Great.

=== First Council of Nicaea ===

The Christological debate could no longer be contained within the Alexandrian diocese. By the time Bishop Alexander finally acted against Arius, Arius&#x27;s doctrine had spread far beyond his own see; it had become a topic of discussion—and disturbance—for the entire Church. The Church was now a powerful force in the Roman world, with Emperors Licinius and Constantine I having legalized it in 313 through the Edict of Milan. Emperor Constantine had taken a personal interest in several ecumenical issues, including the Donatist controversy in 316, and he wanted to bring an end to the Christological dispute. To this end, the emperor sent Hosius, bishop of Córdoba to investigate and, if possible, resolve the controversy. Hosius was armed with an open letter from the Emperor: &quot;Wherefore let each one of you, showing consideration for the other, listen to the impartial exhortation of your fellow-servant.&quot; However, as the debate continued to rage despite Hosius&#x27;s efforts, Constantine in AD 325 took an unprecedented step: he called a council to be composed of church prelates from all parts of the empire to resolve this issue, possibly at Hosius&#x27;s recommendation.

&quot;Around 250–300 attended, drawn almost entirely from the eastern half of the empire.&quot; Pope Sylvester I, himself too aged to attend, sent two priests as his delegates. Arius himself attended the council, as did his bishop, Alexander. Also there were Eusebius of Caesarea, Eusebius of Nicomedia and the young deacon Athanasius, who would become the champion of the Trinitarian view ultimately adopted by the council and spend most of his life battling Arianism. Before the main conclave convened, Hosius initially met with Alexander and his supporters at Nicomedia. The council was presided over by the emperor himself, who participated in and even led some of its discussions.

At this First Council of Nicaea, 22 bishops, led by Eusebius of Nicomedia, came as supporters of Arius. Nonetheless, when some of Arius&#x27;s writings were read aloud, they are reported to have been denounced as blasphemous by most participants. Those who upheld the notion that Christ was co-eternal and consubstantial with the Father were led by the bishop Alexander. Athanasius was not allowed to sit in on the Council because he was only an arch-deacon. However, Athanasius is seen as doing the legwork and concluded (according to Bishop Alexander&#x27;s defense of Athanasian Trinitarianism and also according to the Nicene Creed adopted at this Council) that the Son was of the same essence (homoousios) with the Father (or one in essence with the Father), and was eternally generated from that essence of the Father. Those who instead insisted that the Son of God came after God the Father in time and substance were led by Arius the presbyter. For about two months, the two sides argued and debated, with each appealing to Scripture to justify their respective positions. Arius argued for the supremacy of God the Father, and maintained that the Son of God was simply the oldest and most beloved creature of God, made from nothing, because of being the direct offspring. Arius taught that the pre-existent Son was God&#x27;s first production (the very first thing that God actually ever did in his entire eternal existence up to that point), before all ages. Thus he insisted that only God the Father had no beginning, and that the Father alone was infinite and eternal. Arius maintained that the Son had a beginning. Thus, said Arius, only the Son was directly created and begotten of God; furthermore, there was a time that he had no existence. He was capable of his own free will, said Arius, and thus &quot;were He in the truest sense a son, He must have come after the Father, therefore the time obviously was when He was not, and hence He was a finite being.&quot; Arius appealed to Scripture, quoting verses such as John 14:28: &quot;the Father is greater than I&quot;, as well as Colossians 1:15: &quot;the firstborn of all creation.&quot; Thus, Arius insisted that the Father&#x27;s Divinity was greater than the Son&#x27;s, and that the Son was under God the Father, and not co-equal or co-eternal with him.

According to some accounts in the hagiography of Nicholas of Myra, debate at the council became so heated that at one point, Nicholas struck Arius across the face. The majority of the bishops ultimately agreed upon a creed, known thereafter as the Nicene Creed. It included the word &quot;homoousios&quot;, meaning &quot;consubstantial&quot;, or &quot;one in essence&quot;, which was incompatible with Arius&#x27;s beliefs. On June 19, 325, council and emperor issued a circular to the churches in and around Alexandria: Arius and two of his unyielding partisans (Theonas and Secundus) were deposed and exiled to Illyricum, while three other supporters—Theognis of Nicaea, Eusebius of Nicomedia and Maris of Chalcedon—affixed their signatures solely out of deference to the emperor. The following is part of the ruling made by the emperor denouncing Arius&#x27;s teachings with fervor.

== Exile, return, and death ==

The homoousian party&#x27;s victory at Nicaea was short-lived, however. Despite Arius&#x27; exile and the alleged finality of the Council&#x27;s decrees, the Arian controversy recommenced at once. When Bishop Alexander died in 327, Athanasius succeeded him, despite not meeting the age requirements for a hierarch. Still committed to pacifying the conflict between Arians and Trinitarians, Constantine gradually became more lenient toward those whom the Council of Nicaea had exiled. Though he never repudiated the council or its decrees, the emperor ultimately permitted Arius (who had taken refuge in Palestine) and many of his adherents to return to their homes, once Arius had reformulated his Christology to mute the ideas found most objectionable by his critics. Athanasius was exiled following his condemnation by the First Synod of Tyre in 335 (though he was later recalled), and the Synod of Jerusalem the following year restored Arius to communion. The emperor directed Alexander of Constantinople to receive Arius, despite the bishop&#x27;s objections; Bishop Alexander responded by earnestly praying that Arius might perish before this could happen.

Modern scholars consider that the subsequent death of Arius may have been the result of poisoning by his opponents. In contrast, some contemporaries of Arius asserted that the circumstances of his death were a miraculous consequence of Arius&#x27;s heretical views. The latter view was evident in the account of Arius&#x27;s death by a bitter enemy, Socrates Scholasticus:

The death of Arius did not end the Arian controversy, which would not be settled for centuries in some parts of the Christian world.

== Arianism after Arius ==

=== Immediate aftermath ===

Historians report that Constantine, who had not been baptized for most of his lifetime, was baptized on his deathbed in 337 by the Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia.

Constantius II, who succeeded Constantine, was an Arian sympathizer. Under him, Arianism reached its high point at the Third Council of Sirmium in 357. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held, regarding the doctrines &quot;homoousios&quot; (of one substance) and &quot;homoiousios&quot; (of similar substance), that both were non-biblical; and that the Father is greater than the Son, a confession later dubbed the Blasphemy of Sirmium:

Following the abortive effort by Julian the Apostate to restore paganism in the empire, the emperor Valens—himself an Arian—renewed the persecution of Nicene bishops. However, Valens&#x27;s successor Theodosius I ended Arianism once and for all among the elites of the Eastern Empire through a combination of imperial decree, persecution, and the calling of the First Council of Constantinople in 381 that condemned Arius anew while reaffirming and expanding the Nicene Creed. This generally ended the influence of Arianism among the non-Germanic peoples of the Roman Empire.

=== Arianism in the West ===

Arianism played out very differently in the Western Empire; during the reign of Constantius II, the Arian Gothic convert Ulfilas was consecrated a bishop by Eusebius of Nicomedia and sent to missionize his people. His success ensured the survival of Arianism among the Goths and Vandals until the beginning of the eighth century, when their kingdoms succumbed to the adjacent Niceans or they accepted Nicean Christianity. Arians continued to exist in North Africa, Spain and portions of Italy until they were finally suppressed during the sixth and seventh centuries.

In the 12th century, the Benedictine abbot Peter the Venerable described the Islamic prophet Muhammad as &quot;the successor of Arius and the precursor to the Antichrist&quot;. During the Protestant Reformation, a Polish sect known as the Polish Brethren were often referred to as Arians due to their antitrinitarian doctrine.

=== Contemporary Arianism ===
There are several contemporary Christian and Post-Christian denominations today that echo Arian thinking.

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) are sometimes accused of being Arians by their detractors. However, the Christology of the Latter-day Saints differs in several significant aspects from Arian theology.

The Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses teach that the Son is a created being, and is not actually God, but rather his only-begotten Son.

Some Christians in the Unitarian Universalist movement are influenced by Arian ideas. Contemporary Unitarian Universalist Christians often may be either Arian or Socinian in their Christology, seeing Jesus as a distinctive moral figure but not equal or eternal with God the Father; or they may follow Origen&#x27;s logic of Universal Salvation, and thus potentially affirm the Trinity, but assert that all are already saved.

According to the reincarnationist religion of Spiritism, Jesus, the highest-order spirit that has ever incarnated on Earth, is distinct from God, by whom he was created. Jesus is not considered God or part of God as in Nicene Christianity, but nonetheless the ultimate model of human love, intelligence, and forgiveness, often cited as the governor of Earth.

== Arius&#x27;s doctrine ==
=== Introduction ===

In explaining his actions against Arius, Alexander of Alexandria wrote a letter to Alexander of Constantinople and Eusebius of Nicomedia (where the emperor was then residing), detailing the errors into which he believed Arius had fallen. According to Alexander, Arius taught:

Alexander also refers to Arius&#x27;s poetical &quot;Thalia&quot;:

Eusebius of Caesarea, in his famous book &quot;The Ecclesiastical History&quot; explains Arius&#x27; views as:

=== The Logos ===

The question of the exact relationship between the Father and the Son (a part of the theological science of Christology) had been raised some fifty years before Arius, when Paul of Samosata was deposed in 269 for agreeing with those who used the word &quot;homoousios&quot; (Greek for &#x27;same substance&#x27;) to express the relation between the Father and the Son. This term was thought at that time to have a Sabellian tendency, though—as events showed—this was on account of its scope not having been satisfactorily defined. In the discussion which followed Paul&#x27;s deposition, Dionysius, the Bishop of Alexandria, used much the same language as Arius did later, and correspondence survives in which Pope Dionysius blames him for using such terminology. Dionysius responded with an explanation widely interpreted as vacillating. The Synod of Antioch, which condemned Paul of Samosata, had expressed its disapproval of the word &quot;homoousios&quot; in one sense, while Bishop Alexander undertook its defense in another. Although the controversy seemed to be leaning toward the opinions later championed by Arius, no firm decision had been made on the subject; in an atmosphere so intellectual as that of Alexandria, the debate seemed bound to resurface—and even intensify—at some point in the future.

Arius endorsed the following doctrines about the Son or the Word (&quot;Logos&quot;, referring to Jesus:

# that the Word (&quot;Logos&quot;) and the Father were not of the same essence ();
# that the Son was a created being ( or ); and
# that the worlds were created through him, so he must have existed before them and before all time.
# However, there was a &quot;once&quot; [Arius did not use words meaning &#x27;time&#x27;, such as or ] when he did not exist, before he was begotten of the Father.

== Extant writings ==

Three surviving letters attributed to Arius are his letter to Alexander of Alexandria, his letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia, and his confession to Constantine. In addition, several letters addressed by others to Arius survive, together with brief quotations contained within the polemical works of his opponents. These quotations are often short and taken out of context, and it is difficult to tell how accurately they quote him or represent his true thinking.

=== The &quot;Thalia&quot; ===

Arius&#x27;s &quot;Thalia&quot; (literally, &#x27;festivity&#x27;, &#x27;banquet&#x27;), a popularized work combining prose and verse and summarizing his views on the Logos, survives in quoted fragmentary form. In the &quot;Thalia&quot;, Arius says that God&#x27;s first thought was the creation of the Son, before all ages, therefore time started with the creation of the &quot;Logos&quot; or Word in Heaven (lines 1–9, 30–32). Arius explains how the Son could still be God, even if he did not exist eternally (lines 20–23); and endeavors to explain the ultimate incomprehensibility of the Father to the Son (lines 33–39). The two available references from this work are recorded by his opponent Athanasius: the first is a report of Arius&#x27;s teaching in &quot;Orations Against the Arians&quot;, 1:5–6. This paraphrase has negative comments interspersed throughout, so it is difficult to consider it as being completely reliable.

The second quotation appears on page 15 of the document &quot;On the Councils of Arminum and Seleucia&quot;, also known as . This second passage, entirely in irregular verse, seems to be a direct quotation or a compilation of quotations; it may have been written by someone other than Athanasius, perhaps even a person sympathetic to Arius. This second quotation does not contain several statements usually attributed to Arius by his opponents, is in metrical form, and resembles other passages that have been attributed to Arius. It also contains some positive statements about the Son. But although these quotations seem reasonably accurate, their proper context is lost, so their place in Arius&#x27;s larger system of thought is impossible to reconstruct.

The part of Arius&#x27;s &quot;Thalia&quot; quoted in Athanasius&#x27;s is the longest extant fragment. The most commonly cited edition of is by Hans-Georg Opitz. A translation of this fragment has been made by Aaron J. West, but based not on Opitz&#x27; text but on a previous edition: &quot;When compared to Opitz&#x27; more recent edition of the text, we found that our text varies only in punctuation, capitalization, and one variant reading ( for , line 5).&quot; The Opitz edition with the West translation is as follows:

A slightly different edition of the fragment of the &quot;Thalia&quot; from is given by G.C. Stead, and served as the basis for a translation by R.P.C. Hanson. Stead argued that the &quot;Thalia&quot; was written in anapestic meter, and edited the fragment to show what it would look like in anapests with different line-breaks. Hanson based his translation of this fragment directly on Stead&#x27;s text.

<text>Chrysanthemums ( ), sometimes called mums or chrysanths, are flowering plants in the Asteraceae family. They are native to East Asia and northeastern Europe. Most species originate from East Asia, and the center of diversity is in China. Countless horticultural varieties and cultivars exist.

== Description ==

The genus &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; are perennial herbaceous flowering plants, sometimes subshrubs. The leaves are alternate, divided into leaflets and may be pinnatisect, lobed, or serrate (toothed) but rarely entire; they are connected to stalks with hairy bases.

The compound inflorescence is an array of several flower heads, or sometimes a solitary head. The head has a base covered in layers of phyllaries. The simple row of ray florets is white, yellow, or red. The disc florets are yellow. Pollen grains are approximately 34 microns.

The fruit is a ribbed achene.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;chrysanthemum&quot; is derived from the &quot;chrysos&quot; (gold) and &quot;anthemon&quot; (flower).

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; was first formally described by Linnaeus in 1753, with 14 species, and hence bears his name () as the botanical authority. The genus once included more species, but was split several decades ago into several genera, putting the economically important florist&#x27;s chrysanthemums in the genus &quot;Dendranthema&quot;. The naming of these genera has been contentious, but a ruling of the International Botanical Congress in 1999 changed the defining species of the genus to &quot;Chrysanthemum indicum&quot;, restoring the florist&#x27;s chrysanthemums to the genus &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot;.

Genera now separated from &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; include &quot;Argyranthemum&quot;, &quot;Glebionis&quot;, &quot;Leucanthemopsis&quot;, &quot;Leucanthemum&quot;, &quot;Rhodanthemum&quot;, and &quot;Tanacetum&quot;.

== Ecology ==

Chrysanthemums start blooming in early autumn. They are also known as a flower associated with the month of November.

== Cultivation ==

Chrysanthemums () were first cultivated in China as a flowering herb as far back as the 15th century BCE. Over 500 cultivars had been recorded by 1630. By 2014, it was estimated that there were over 20,000 cultivars in the world and about 7,000 cultivars in China. The plant is renowned as one of the Four Gentlemen () in Chinese and East Asian Art. The plant is particularly significant during the Double Ninth Festival.

Chrysanthemum cultivation in Japan began during the Nara and Heian periods (early 8th to late 12th centuries) and gained popularity in the Edo period (early 17th to late 19th century). Many flower shapes, colours, and varieties were created. The way the flowers were grown and shaped also developed, and chrysanthemum culture flourished. Various cultivars of chrysanthemums created in the Edo period were characterized by a remarkable variety of flower shapes. They were exported to China from the end of the Edo period, changing the way Chinese chrysanthemum cultivars were grown and their popularity. In addition, from the Meiji period (late 19th to early 20th century), many cultivars with flowers over in diameter, called the &quot;Ogiku&quot; (lit., great chrysanthemum) style, were created, which influenced the subsequent trend of chrysanthemums. The Imperial Seal of Japan is a chrysanthemum, and the institution of the monarchy is also called the Chrysanthemum Throne. A number of festivals and shows take place throughout Japan in autumn when the flowers bloom. is one of the five ancient sacred festivals. It is celebrated on the 9th day of the 9th month. It was started in 910, when the imperial court held its first chrysanthemum show.

Chrysanthemums entered American horticulture in 1798 when Colonel John Stevens imported a cultivated variety known as Dark Purple from England. The introduction was part of an effort to grow attractions within Elysian Fields in Hoboken, New Jersey.

== Uses ==

=== Ornamental uses ===

Modern cultivated chrysanthemums are usually brighter and more striking than their wild relatives. Many horticultural specimens have been bred to bear many rows of ray florets in a great variety of colors. The flower heads occur in various forms, and can be daisy-like or decorative, like pompons or buttons. This genus contains many hybrids and thousands of cultivars developed for horticultural purposes. In addition to the traditional yellow, other colors are available, such as white, purple, and red. The most important hybrid is &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; × &quot;morifolium&quot; (syn. &quot;C.&quot; × &quot;grandiflorum&quot;), derived primarily from &quot;C. indicum&quot;, but also involving other species.

Over 140 cultivars of chrysanthemum have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).

In Japan, a form of &quot;bonsai&quot; chrysanthemum was developed over the centuries. The cultivated flower has a lifespan of about 5 years and can be kept in miniature size. Another method is to use pieces of dead wood and the flower grows over the back along the wood to give the illusion from the front that the miniature tree blooms.

=== Culinary uses ===
Yellow or white chrysanthemum flowers of the species &quot;C. morifolium&quot; are boiled to make a tea in some parts of East Asia. The resulting beverage is known simply as chrysanthemum tea ( , pinyin: &quot;júhuā chá&quot;, in Chinese). In Korea, a rice wine flavored with chrysanthemum flowers is called &quot;gukhwaju&quot; (국화주).

Chrysanthemum leaves are steamed or boiled and used as greens, especially in Chinese cuisine. The flowers may be added to dishes such as &quot;mixian&quot; in broth or thick snakemeat soup (蛇羹) to enhance the aroma. They are commonly used in hot pot and stir fries. In Japanese cuisine, small chrysanthemums are used as garnish for sashimi.

=== Insecticidal uses ===
Pyrethrum (&quot;Chrysanthemum &quot;[or&quot; Tanacetum&quot;]&quot; cinerariaefolium&quot;) is economically important as a natural source of insecticide. The flowers are pulverized, and the active components, called pyrethrins, which occur in the achenes, are extracted and sold in the form of an oleoresin. This is applied as a suspension in water or oil, or as a powder. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects, and inhibit female mosquitoes from biting. In sublethal doses, they have an insect repellent effect. They are harmful to fish, but are far less toxic to mammals and birds than many synthetic insecticides. They are not persistent, being biodegradable, and also decompose easily on exposure to light. Pyrethroids such as permethrin are synthetic insecticides based on natural pyrethrum. Despite this, chrysanthemum leaves are still a major host for destructive pests, such as leafminer flies including &quot;L. trifolii&quot;.

Persian powder is an example of industrial product of chrysanthemum insecticide.

=== Environmental uses ===
Chrysanthemum plants have been shown to reduce indoor air pollution by the NASA Clean Air Study.

== In culture ==
In some European countries (e.g., France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Croatia), incurve chrysanthemums symbolize death and are used only for funerals or on graves, while other types carry no such symbolism; similarly, in China, Japan, and Korea of East Asia, white chrysanthemums symbolize adversity, lamentation, and/or grief. In some other countries, they represent honesty. In the United States, the flower is usually regarded as positive and cheerful, with New Orleans as a notable exception.

In the Victorian language of flowers, the chrysanthemum had several meanings. The Chinese chrysanthemum meant cheerfulness, whereas the red chrysanthemum stood for &quot;I Love&quot;, while the yellow chrysanthemum symbolized slighted love. The chrysanthemum is also the flower of November.

==== China ====

* The chrysanthemum is the city flower of Beijing and Kaifeng. The tradition of cultivating different varieties of chrysanthemums stretches back 1600 years, and the scale reached a phenomenal level during the Song dynasty until its loss to the Jürchens in 1126. The city has held the Kaifeng Chrysanthemum Cultural Festival since 1983 (renamed China Kaifeng Chrysanthemum Cultural Festival in 1994). The event is the largest chrysanthemum festival in China; it has been a yearly feature since, taking place between 18 October and 18 November every year.
* The chrysanthemum is one of the &quot;Four Gentlemen&quot; () of China (the others being the plum blossom, the orchid, and bamboo). The chrysanthemum is said to have been favored by Tao Qian, an influential Chinese poet, and is symbolic of nobility. It is also one of the four symbolic seasonal flowers.
* A chrysanthemum festival is held each year in Tongxiang, near Hangzhou, China.
* Chrysanthemums are the topic in hundreds of poems of China.
* The &quot;golden flower&quot; referred to in the 2006 movie &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; is a chrysanthemum.
* &quot;Chrysanthemum Gate&quot; (jú huā mén ), often abbreviated as Chrysanthemum (菊花), is taboo slang meaning &quot;anus&quot; (with sexual connotations).
* An ancient Chinese city (Xiaolan Town of Zhongshan City) was named Ju-Xian, meaning &quot;chrysanthemum city&quot;.
* The plant is particularly significant during the Chinese Double Ninth Festival.
* In Chinese culture, the chrysanthemum is a symbol of autumn and the flower of the ninth moon. People even drank chrysanthemum wine on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month to prolong their lives during the Han dynasty. It is a symbol of longevity because of its health-giving properties. Because of all of this, the flower was often worn on funeral attire.
* Pharmacopoeia of the People&#x27;s Republic of China listed two kinds of chrysanthemum for medical use, Yejuhua and Juhua. Historically Yejuhua is said to treat carbuncle, furuncle, conjunctivitis, headache, and vertigo. Juhua is said to treat cold, headache, vertigo, and conjunctivitis. 

==== Japan ====

Chrysanthemums first arrived in Japan by way of China in the 5th century. The chrysanthemum has been used as a theme of &quot;waka&quot; (Japanese traditional poetry) since around the 10th century in the Heian period, and &quot;Kokin Wakashū&quot; is the most famous of them. In the 12th century, during the Kamakura period, when the Retired Emperor Go-Toba adopted it as the mon (family crest) of the Imperial family, it became a flower that symbolized autumn in Japan. During the Edo period from the 17th century to the 19th century, due to the development of economy and culture, the cultivation of chrysanthemums, cherry blossoms, Japanese iris, morning glory, etc. became popular, many cultivars were created and many chrysanthemum exhibitions were held. From the Meiji period in the latter half of the 19th century, due to the growing importance of the chrysanthemum, which symbolized the Imperial family, the creation of &quot;ogiku&quot; style cultivars with a diameter of 20 cm or more became popular.

In the present day, each autumn there are chrysanthemum exhibitions at the Shinjuku Gyo-en, Meiji Shrine and Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. The Yasukuni Shrine, formerly a state-endowed shrine (官国弊社, &quot;kankokuheisha&quot;) has adopted the chrysanthemum crest. Culinary-grade chrysanthemums are used to decorate food, and they remain a common motif for traditional Japanese arts like porcelain, lacquerware and &quot;kimono&quot;.

Chrysanthemum growing is still practised actively as a hobby by many Japanese people who enter prize plants in contests. Chrysanthemum &quot;dolls&quot;, often depicting fictional characters from both traditional sources like &quot;kabuki&quot; and contemporary sources like Disney, are displayed throughout the fall months, and the city of Nihonmatsu hosts the &quot;Nihonmatsu Chrysanthemum Dolls Exhibition&quot; every autumn in historical ruin of Nihonmatsu Castle. They are also grown into chrysanthemum bonsai forms.
* In Japan, the chrysanthemum is a symbol of the Emperor and the Imperial family. In particular, a &quot;chrysanthemum crest&quot; (菊花紋章, &quot;kikukamonshō&quot; or&quot; kikkamonshō&quot;), i.e. a mon of chrysanthemum blossom design, indicates a link to the Emperor; there are more than 150 patterns of this design. Notable uses of and reference to the Imperial chrysanthemum include:
** The Imperial Seal of Japan is used by members of the Japanese imperial family. In 1869, a two-layered, 16-petal design was designated as the symbol of the emperor. Princes used a simpler, single-layer pattern.
** The Chrysanthemum Throne is the name given to the position of Japanese Emperor and the throne.
** The Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum is a Japanese honor awarded by the emperor on the advice of the Japanese government.
** In Imperial Japan, small arms were required to be stamped with the imperial chrysanthemum, as they were considered the personal property of the emperor.
* The Nagoya Castle Chrysanthemum Competition started after the end of the Pacific War. The event at the castle has become a tradition for the city. With three categories, it is one of the largest events of its kind in the region by both scale and content. The first category is the exhibition of cultivated flowers. The second category is for &quot;bonsai&quot; flowers, which are combined with dead pieces of wood to give the illusion of miniature trees. The third category is the creation of miniature landscapes.
==== Korea ====

The flower is found extensively in inlaid Goreyo ware and were reproduced in stamp form in Buncheong wares. Several twentieth century potters, especially Kim Se-yong, created double-wall wares featuring each individual petal painted in white clay against a celadon background. A vase produced using this technique and presented in 1999 to Queen Elizabeth II can be found in the Royal Collection.
Laying a wreath of white chrysanthemums to mourn at funerals has been common since the early 20th century. Before the 20th century, white clothing was traditionally worn in funeral settings. However, the introduction of Western culture made black the prevalent color. White chrysanthemums were instead used to preserve the tradition of using white to mourn at funerals.

Korea has a number of flower shows that exhibit the chrysanthemum, such as the Masan Gagopa Chrysanthemum Festival.

=== West Asia ===
==== Iran ====
In Iran, chrysanthemums are associated with the Zoroastrian spiritual being Ashi Vanghuhi (lit. &#x27;good blessings, rewards&#x27;), a female Yazad (angel) presiding over blessings.

=== Oceania ===
==== Australia ====
In Australia, on Mother&#x27;s Day, which falls in May when the flower is in season, people traditionally wear a white chrysanthemum, or a similar white flower to honour their mothers. Chrysanthemums are often given as Mother&#x27;s Day presents.

=== North America ===
==== United States ====
* On 5 and 6 November 1883, in Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS), at the request of the Florists and Growers Society, held its first Chrysanthemum Show in Horticultural Hall. This would be the first of several chrysanthemum events presented by PHS to the public.
* The founding of the chrysanthemum industry dates back to 1884, when the Enomoto brothers of Redwood City, California, grew the first chrysanthemums cultivated in America.
* In 1913, Sadakasu Enomoto (of San Mateo County) astounded the flower world by successfully shipping a carload of Turner chrysanthemums to New Orleans for the All Saints Day Celebration.
* The chrysanthemum was recognized as the official flower of the city of Chicago by Mayor Richard J. Daley in 1966.
* The chrysanthemum is the official flower of the city of Salinas, California.
* The chrysanthemum is the official flower of several fraternities and sororities, including Chi Phi, Phi Kappa Sigma, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, Lambda Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha, and Triangle Fraternity.

=== Europe ===
==== Italy ====
Italian composer Giacomo Puccini wrote &quot;Crisantemi&quot; (1890), a movement for string quartet, in memory of his friend Amedeo di Savoia Duca d&#x27;Aosta. In Italy (and other European countries) the chrysanthemum is the flower that people traditionally bring to their deceased loved ones at the cemetery and is generally associated with mourning. A probable reason for this is the fact that the plant flowers between the end of October and the beginning of November, coinciding with the Day of the Dead (2 November).

==== Poland ====
Chrysanthemums are placed on graves to honor the dead during All Saints&#x27; Day and All Souls&#x27; Day in Poland.

==== United Kingdom ====
The UK National Collection of hardy chrysanthemums is at Hill Close Gardens near Warwick.

<doc id="296550" wikidata="Q764912" url="?curid=296550" title="British literature">
<text>British literature is from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands. This article covers British literature in the English language. Anglo-Saxon (Old English) literature is included, and there is some discussion of Latin and Anglo-Norman literature, where literature in these languages relate to the early development of the English language and literature. There is also some brief discussion of major figures who wrote in Scots, but the main discussion is in the various Scottish literature articles.

The article Literature in the other languages of Britain focuses on the literatures written in the other languages that are, and have been, used in Britain. There are also articles on these various literatures: Latin literature in Britain, Anglo-Norman, Cornish, Guernésiais, Jèrriais, Latin, Manx, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, etc.

Irish writers have played an important part in the development of literature in England and Scotland, but though the whole of Ireland was politically part of the United Kingdom from January 1801 to December 1922, it can be controversial to describe Irish literature as British. For some this includes works by authors from Northern Ireland.

The United Kingdom publishes more books per capita than any other country in the world.

==British identity==
The nature of British identity has changed over time. The island that contains England, Scotland, and Wales has been known as Britain from the time of the Roman Pliny the Elder (–79). English as the national language had its beginnings with the Anglo-Saxon invasion which started around AD 450. Before that, the inhabitants mainly spoke various Celtic languages. The various constituent parts of the present United Kingdom joined at different times. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1542. However, it was not until 1707 with a treaty between England and Scotland that the Kingdom of Great Britain came into existence. This merged in January 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Subsequently, Irish nationalism led to the partition of the island of Ireland in 1922; thus the literature of the Republic of Ireland is not British, although literature from Northern Ireland is both Irish and British.
In 1927 the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 formally changing the name of the UK to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
Until fairly recent times Celtic languages continued to be spoken widely in Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, and Ireland, and these languages still survive, especially in parts of Wales.

Works written in the English language by Welsh writers, especially if their subject matter relates to Wales, has been recognised as a distinctive entity since the 20th century. The need for a separate identity for this kind of writing arose because of the parallel development of modern Welsh-language literature.

Because Britain was a colonial power the use of English spread through the world; from the 19th century or earlier in the United States, and later in other former colonies, major writers in English began to appear beyond the boundaries of Britain and Ireland; later these included Nobel laureates.

==The coming of the Anglo-Saxons: 449–c.1066==
===The other languages of early Britain===
Although the Romans withdrew from Britain in the early 5th century, Latin literature, mostly ecclesiastical, continued to be written, including Chronicles by Bede (672/3–735), &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot;; and Gildas (–570), &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;. 
Various Celtic languages were spoken by many British people at that time. Among the more important written works that have survived are &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; and the Mabinogion. From the 8th to the 15th centuries, Vikings and Norse settlers and their descendants colonised parts of what is now modern Scotland. Some Old Norse poetry survives relating to this period, including the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, an historical narrative of the history of the Orkney Islands, from its capture by the Norwegian king in the 9th century until about 1200.

===Old English literature: c. 658–1100===
Old English literature, or Anglo-Saxon literature, encompasses the surviving literature written in Old English in Anglo-Saxon England, from the settlement of the Saxons and other Germanic tribes in England (Jutes and the Angles) around 450, until &quot;soon after the Norman Conquest&quot; in 1066; that is, c. 1100–50. These works include genres such as epic poetry, hagiography, sermons, Bible translations, legal works, chronicles, riddles, and others. In all. there are about 400 surviving manuscripts from the period.

Oral tradition was very strong in early English culture and most literary works were written to be performed. Epic poems were thus very popular, and some, including &quot;Beowulf&quot;, have survived to the present day. &quot;Beowulf&quot; is the most famous work in Old English and has achieved national epic status in England, despite being set in Scandinavia.

Nearly all Anglo-Saxon authors are anonymous: 12 are known by name from medieval sources, but only four of those are known by their vernacular works with any certainty: Cædmon, Bede, Alfred the Great, and Cynewulf. Cædmon is the earliest English poet whose name is known. Cædmon&#x27;s only known surviving work is &quot;Cædmon&#x27;s Hymn&quot;, which probably dates from the late 7th century.

Chronicles contained a range of historical and literary accounts, and a notable example is the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. The poem &quot;Battle of Maldon&quot; also deals with history. This is the name given to a work, of uncertain date, celebrating the real Battle of Maldon of 991, at which the Anglo-Saxons failed to prevent a Viking invasion.

Classical antiquity was not forgotten in Anglo-Saxon England, and several Old English poems are adaptations of late classical philosophical texts. The longest is King Alfred&#x27;s (849–99) translation of Boethius&#x27; &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;.

==Late medieval literature: 1066–1500==
The linguistic diversity of the islands in the medieval period contributed to a rich variety of artistic production, and made British literature distinctive and innovative.

Some works were still written in Latin; these include Gerald of Wales&#x27;s late-12th-century book on his beloved Wales, &quot;Itinerarium Cambriae&quot;. After the Norman Conquest of 1066, Anglo-Norman literature developed, introducing literary trends from Continental Europe, such as the &quot;chanson de geste&quot;. However, the indigenous development of Anglo-Norman literature was precocious in comparison to continental Oïl literature.

Geoffrey of Monmouth ( – ) was one of the major figures in the development of British history and of the popularity of the tales of King Arthur. He is best known for his chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (History of the Kings of Britain) of 1136, which spread Celtic motifs to a wider audience. Wace ( – after 1174), who wrote in Norman-French, is the earliest known poet from Jersey; he also developed the Arthurian legend.) At the end of the 12th century, Layamon in &quot;Brut&quot; adapted Wace to make the first English-language work to use the legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. It was also the first historiography written in English since the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

===Middle English===
Interest in King Arthur continued in the 15th century with Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (1485), a popular and influential compilation of some French and English Arthurian romances. It was among the early books printed in England by Caxton.

In the later medieval period a new form of English now known as Middle English evolved. This is the earliest form which is comprehensible to modern readers and listeners, albeit not easily. Middle English Bible translations, notably Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible, helped to establish English as a literary language. Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible is the name now given to a group of Bible translations into Middle English that were made under the direction of, or at the instigation of, John Wycliffe. They appeared over a period from about 1382 to 1395.

&quot;Piers Plowman&quot; or &quot;Visio Willelmi de Petro Plowman&quot; (&quot;William&#x27;s Vision of Piers Plowman&quot;) (written c. 1360–1387) is a Middle English allegorical narrative poem by William Langland. It is written in unrhymed alliterative verse divided into sections called &quot;passūs&quot; (Latin for &quot;steps&quot;). &quot;Piers&quot; is considered by many critics to be one of the early great works of English literature along with Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; and &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; during the Middle Ages.

&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; is a late-14th-century Middle English alliterative romance. It is one of the better-known Arthurian stories, of an established type known as the &quot;beheading game&quot;. Developing from Welsh, Irish and English tradition &quot;Sir Gawain&quot; highlights the importance of honour and chivalry. &quot;Preserved in the same manuscript with Sir Gawayne were three other poems, now generally accepted as the work of its author, including the intricate elegiac poem, &quot;Pearl&quot;.&quot;
Geoffrey Chaucer ( – 1400), known as the Father of English literature, is widely considered the greatest English poet of the Middle Ages and was the first poet to have been buried in Poet&#x27;s Corner in Westminster Abbey. Chaucer is best known today for &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, a collection of stories written in Middle English (mostly written in verse although some are in prose), that are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from Southwark to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. Chaucer is a crucial figure in developing the legitimacy of Middle English at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were French and Latin.

The multilingual nature of the audience for literature in the 14th century can be illustrated by the example of John Gower ( – October 1408). A contemporary of Langland and a personal friend of Chaucer, Gower is remembered primarily for three major works, the &quot;Mirroir de l&#x27;Omme&quot;, &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot;, and &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;, three long poems written in Anglo-Norman, Latin, and Middle English respectively, which are united by common moral and political themes.

Women writers were also active, such as Marie de France in the 12th century and Julian of Norwich in the early 14th century. Julian&#x27;s &quot;Revelations of Divine Love&quot; (around 1393) is believed to be the first published book written by a woman in the English language. Margery Kempe ( – after 1438) is known for writing &quot;The Book of Margery Kempe&quot;, a work considered by some to be the first autobiography in the English language.

Major Scottish writers from the 15th century include Henrysoun, Dunbar, Douglas and Lyndsay. The works of Chaucer had an influence on Scottish writers.

===Medieval drama===

In the Middle Ages, drama in the vernacular languages of Europe may have emerged from religious enactments of the liturgy. Mystery plays were presented on the porches of the cathedrals or by strolling players on feast days. Miracle and mystery plays, along with moralities and interludes, later evolved into more elaborate forms of drama, such as was seen on the Elizabethan stages. Another form of medieval theatre was the mummers&#x27; plays, a form of early street theatre associated with the Morris dance, concentrating on themes such as Saint George and the Dragon and Robin Hood. These were folk tales re-telling old stories, and the actors travelled from town to town performing these for their audiences in return for money and hospitality.

Mystery plays and miracle plays are among the early formally developed plays in medieval Europe. Mystery plays focused on the representation of Bible stories in churches as tableaux with accompanying antiphonal song. They developed from the 10th to the 16th century, reaching the height of their popularity in the 15th century before being rendered obsolete by the rise of professional theatre.

There are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays from the late medieval period. The most complete is the &quot;York cycle&quot; of forty-eight pageants. They were performed in the city of York, from the middle of the 14th century until 1569. Besides the Middle English drama, there are three surviving plays in Cornish known as the Ordinalia.

Having grown out of the religiously based mystery plays, the morality play is a genre of medieval and early Tudor theatrical entertainment, which represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre. Morality plays are a type of allegory in which the protagonist is met by personifications of various moral attributes who try to prompt him to choose a godly life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries.

&quot;The Somonyng of Everyman&quot; (&quot;The Summoning of Everyman&quot;) ( – 1519), usually referred to simply as &quot;Everyman&quot;, is a late 15th-century English morality play. Like John Bunyan&#x27;s allegory &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1678), &quot;Everyman&quot; examines the question of Christian salvation through the use of allegorical characters.

==The Renaissance: 1500 –1660==
Renaissance style and ideas were slow to penetrate England and Scotland, and the Elizabethan era (1558–1603) is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance. However, many scholars see its beginnings in the early 1500s during the reign of Henry VIII (1491 – 1547).

Italian literary influences arrived in Britain: the sonnet form was introduced into English by Thomas Wyatt in the early 16th century, and was developed by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, (1516/1517 – 1547), who also introduced blank verse into England, with his translation of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; in .

The spread of printing affected the transmission of literature across Britain and Ireland. The first book printed in English, William Caxton&#x27;s own translation of &quot;Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye&quot;, was printed abroad in 1473, to be followed by the establishment of the first printing press in England in 1474. 
Latin continued in use as a language of learning long after the Reformation had established the vernaculars as liturgical languages for the elites.

&quot;Utopia&quot; is a work of fiction and political philosophy by Thomas More (1478–1535) published in 1516. The book, written in Latin, is a frame narrative primarily depicting a fictional island society and its religious, social and political customs.

===Elizabethan era: 1558–1603===

====Poetry====
In the later 16th century, English poetry used elaborate language and extensive allusions to classical myths. Sir Edmund Spenser (1555–99) was the author of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I. The works of Sir Philip Sidney (1554–1586), a poet, courtier and soldier, include &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot;, &quot;The Defence of Poetry&quot;, and &quot;Arcadia&quot;. Poems intended to be set to music as songs, such as those by Thomas Campion, became popular as printed literature was disseminated more widely in households (see English Madrigal School).

====Drama====
During the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and then James I (1603–25), a London-centred culture that was both courtly and popular, produced great poetry and drama. The English playwrights were intrigued by Italian model: a conspicuous community of Italian actors had settled in London. The linguist and lexicographer John Florio (1553–1625), whose father was Italian, was a royal language tutor at the Court of James I, and a possible friend and influence on William Shakespeare, had brought much of the Italian language and culture to England. He was also the translator of Montaigne into English. The earlier Elizabethan plays include &quot;Gorboduc&quot; (1561), by Sackville and Norton, and Thomas Kyd&#x27;s (1558–94) revenge tragedy &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; (1592). Highly popular and influential in its time, &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; established a new genre in English literature theatre, the revenge play or revenge tragedy. Jane Lumley (1537–1578) was the first person to translate Euripides into English. Her translation of &quot;Iphigeneia at Aulis&quot; is the first known dramatic work by a woman in English.

William Shakespeare (1564–1616) stands out in this period as a poet and playwright as yet unsurpassed. Shakespeare wrote plays in a variety of genres, including histories, tragedies, comedies and the late romances, or tragicomedies. Works written in the Elizabethan era include the comedy &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, tragedy &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and history &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;.

=== Jacobean period: 1603-1625===
====Drama====
Shakespeare&#x27;s career continued during the reign of King James I, and in the early 17th century, he wrote the so-called &quot;problem plays&quot;, like &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; as well as a number of his better-known tragedies, including &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Anthony and Cleopatra&quot;. The plots of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies often hinge on fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves. In his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed four major plays, including &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.

Other important figures in Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre include Christopher Marlowe (1564–1593), Thomas Dekker ( – 1632), John Fletcher (1579–1625) and Francis Beaumont (1584–1616). Marlowe&#x27;s subject matter is different from Shakespeare&#x27;s as it focuses more on the moral drama of the renaissance man. His play Doctor Faustus (), is about a scientist and magician who sells his soul to the Devil. Beaumont and Fletcher are less known, but they may have helped Shakespeare write some of his better dramas, and were popular at the time. Beaumont&#x27;s comedy, &quot;The Knight of the Burning Pestle&quot; (1607), satirises the rising middle class and especially the &quot;nouveaux riches&quot;.

After Shakespeare&#x27;s death, the poet and dramatist Ben Jonson (1572–1637) was the leading literary figure of the Jacobean era. Jonson&#x27;s aesthetics hark back to the Middle Ages and his characters embody the theory of humours, based on contemporary medical theory, though the stock types of Latin literature were an equal influence. Jonson&#x27;s major plays include &quot;Volpone&quot; (1605 or 1606) and &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; (1614).

A popular style of theatre in Jacobean times was the revenge play, which had been popularised earlier by Thomas Kyd (1558–94), and then developed by John Webster (1578–1632) in the 17th century. Webster&#x27;s famous plays are &quot;The White Devil&quot; (1612) and &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; (1613). Other revenge tragedies include &quot;The Changeling&quot; written by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley.

====Poetry====
Shakespeare also popularised the English sonnet, which made significant changes to Petrarch&#x27;s model. A collection of 154 sonnets, dealing with themes such as the passage of time, love, beauty and mortality, were first published in a 1609 quarto.
Besides Shakespeare, the major poets of the early 17th century included the metaphysical poets John Donne (1572–1631) and George Herbert (1593–1633). Influenced by continental Baroque, and taking as his subject matter both Christian mysticism and eroticism, Donne&#x27;s metaphysical poetry uses unconventional or &quot;unpoetic&quot; figures, such as a compass or a mosquito, to achieve surprise effects.

George Chapman (?1559-?1634) was a successful playwright who is remembered chiefly for his translation in 1616 of Homer&#x27;s Iliad and Odyssey into English verse. This was the first complete translation of either poem into the English language, and it had a profound influence on English literature.

====Prose====
Philosopher Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) wrote the utopian novel &quot;New Atlantis&quot;, and coined the phrase &quot;Knowledge Is Power&quot;. Francis Godwin&#x27;s 1638 &quot;The Man in the Moone&quot; recounts an imaginary voyage to the moon and is now regarded as the first work of science fiction in English literature.

At the Reformation, the translation of liturgy and the Bible into vernacular languages provided new literary models. The &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; (1549) and the &quot;Authorised King James Version&quot; of the Bible have been hugely influential. The King James Bible, one of the great translation projects in the history of English up to that time, was started in 1604 and completed in 1611. It continued the tradition of Bible translation into English from the original languages that began with the work of William Tyndale. (Previous translations into English had relied on the Vulgate). It became the standard Bible of the Church of England, and some consider it one of the great literary works of all time.

===Late Renaissance: 1625–1660===

The metaphysical poets continued writing in this period. Both John Donne and George Herbert died after 1625, but there was a second generation of metaphysical poets: Andrew Marvell (1621–1678), Thomas Traherne (1636 or 1637–1674) and Henry Vaughan (1622–1695). Their style was witty, with metaphysical conceits – far-fetched or unusual similes or metaphors, such as Marvell&#x27;s comparison of the soul with a drop of dew; or Donne&#x27;s description of the effects of absence on lovers to the action of a pair of compasses.

Another important group of poets at this time were the Cavalier poets. They were an important group of writers, who came from the classes that supported King Charles I during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639–51). (King Charles reigned from 1625 and was executed in 1649). The best known of these poets are Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, Thomas Carew, and Sir John Suckling. They &quot;were not a formal group, but all were influenced&quot; by Ben Jonson. Most of the Cavalier poets were courtiers, with notable exceptions. For example, Robert Herrick was not a courtier, but his style marks him as a Cavalier poet. Cavalier works make use of allegory and classical allusions, and they are influenced by Latin authors Horace, Cicero, and Ovid.
John Milton (1608–74) is one of the great English poets, who wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval. He is generally seen as the last major poet of the English Renaissance, though his major epic poems were written in the Restoration period, including &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (1671). Among these are &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot;, 1631; &quot;Il Penseroso&quot;, 1634; &quot;Comus&quot; (a masque), 1638; and &quot;Lycidas&quot;, (1638). His later major works are &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;, 1671 and &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;, 1671. Milton&#x27;s works reflect deep personal convictions, a passion for freedom and self-determination, and the urgent issues and political turbulence of his day. Writing in English, Latin, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime, and his celebrated &quot;Areopagitica&quot; (1644), written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship, is among history&#x27;s influential and impassioned defences of free speech and freedom of the press. William Hayley&#x27;s 1796 biography called him the &quot;greatest English author&quot;, and he remains generally regarded &quot;as one of the preeminent writers in the English language&quot;.

Thomas Urquhart (1611–1660) translation of Rabelais&#x27; &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; into English has been described as &quot;the greatest Scottish translation since Gavin Douglas&#x27;s &quot;Eneados&quot;&quot;.

==The Restoration: 1660–1700==
===Drama===
The Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 launched a fresh start for literature, both in celebration of the new worldly and playful court of the king, and in reaction to it. Theatres in England reopened after having been closed during the protectorship of Oliver Cromwell, Puritanism lost its momentum, and the bawdy &quot;Restoration comedy&quot; became a recognisable genre. Restoration comedy refers to English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710. In addition, women were allowed to perform on stage for the first time.

The Restoration of the monarchy in Ireland enabled Ogilby to resume his position as Master of the Revels and open the first Theatre Royal in Dublin in 1662 in Smock Alley. In 1662, Katherine Philips went to Dublin, where she completed a translation of Pierre Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Pompée&quot;, produced with great success in 1663 in the Smock Alley Theatre, and printed in the same year both in Dublin and London. Although other women had translated or written dramas, her translation of Pompey broke new ground as the first rhymed version of a French tragedy in English and the first English play written by a woman to be performed on the professional stage. Aphra Behn (one of the women writers dubbed &quot;The fair triumvirate of wit&quot;) was a prolific dramatist and one of the early English professional female writers. Her greatest dramatic success was &quot;The Rover&quot; (1677).

===Poetry===

Behn&#x27;s depiction of the character Willmore in &quot;The Rover&quot; and the witty, poetry-reciting rake Dorimant in George Etherege&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Mode&quot; (1676) are seen as a satire on John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester (1647–1680), an English libertine poet, and a wit of the Restoration court. His contemporary Andrew Marvell described him as &quot;the best English satirist&quot;, and he is generally considered to be the most considerable poet and the most learned among the Restoration wits. His &quot;A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind&quot; is assumed to be a Hobbesian critique of rationalism. Rochester&#x27;s poetic work varies widely in form, genre, and content. He was part of a &quot;mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease&quot;, who continued to produce their poetry in manuscripts, rather than in publication. As a consequence, some of Rochester&#x27;s work deals with topical concerns, such as satires of courtly affairs in libels, to parodies of the styles of his contemporaries, such as Sir Charles Scroope. He is also notable for his impromptus, Voltaire, who spoke of Rochester as &quot;the man of genius, the great poet&quot;, admired his satire for its &quot;energy and fire&quot; and translated some lines into French to &quot;display the shining imagination his lordship only could boast&quot;.

John Dryden (1631–1700) was an English poet, literary critic, translator, and playwright who dominated the literary life of Restoration England to such a point that the period came to be known in literary circles as the Age of Dryden. He established the heroic couplet as a standard form of English poetry by writing successful satires, religious pieces, fables, epigrams, compliments, prologues, and plays with it; he also introduced the alexandrine and triplet into the form. In his poems, translations, and criticism, he established a poetic diction appropriate to the heroic couplet. Dryden&#x27;s great achievements were in satiric verse in works like the mock-heroic &quot;MacFlecknoe&quot; (1682). W. H. Auden referred to him as &quot;the master of the middle style&quot; that was a model for his contemporaries and for much of the 18th century. The considerable loss felt by the English literary community at his death was evident from the elegies that it inspired. Alexander Pope (1688–1744) was heavily influenced by Dryden, and often borrowed from him; other writers in the 18th century were equally influenced by both Dryden and Pope.

Though Ben Jonson had been poet laureate to James I in England, this was not then a formal position and the formal title of Poet Laureate, as a royal office, was first conferred by letters patent on John Dryden in 1670. The post then became a regular British institution.

===Prose===
Diarists John Evelyn (1620–1706) and Samuel Pepys (1633–1703) depicted everyday London life and the cultural scene of the times. Their works are among the more important primary sources for the Restoration period in England, and consists of eyewitness accounts of many great events, such as the Great Plague of London (1644–5), and the Great Fire of London (1666).

The publication of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (Part I:1678; 1684), established the Puritan preacher John Bunyan (1628–88) as a notable writer. Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; is an allegory of personal salvation and a guide to the Christian life. Bunyan writes about how the individual can prevail against the temptations of mind and body that threaten damnation. The book is written in a straightforward narrative and shows influence from both drama and biography, and yet it also shows an awareness of the grand allegorical tradition found in Edmund Spenser.

==18th century==
===The Augustan age: 1701–1750===

The late 17th, early 18th century (1689–1750) in English literature is known as the Augustan Age. Writers at this time &quot;greatly admired their Roman counterparts, imitated their works and frequently drew parallels between&quot; contemporary world and the age of the Roman emperor Augustus (27 AD – BC 14) (see Augustan literature (ancient Rome) ). Some of the major writers in this period were the Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift (1667–1745), William Congreve, (1670–1729), Joseph Addison (1672–1719), Richard Steele (1672–1729), Alexander Pope (1688–1744), Samuel Richardson (1689-1761), Henry Fielding (1707–54), Samuel Johnson (1709–84).

====1707: Birth of Britain====

The Union of the Parliaments of Scotland and England in 1707 to form a single Kingdom of Great Britain and the creation of a joint state by the Acts of Union had little impact on the literature of England nor on national consciousness among English writers. The situation in Scotland was different: the desire to maintain a cultural identity while partaking of the advantages offered by the English literary market and English literary standard language led to what has been described as the &quot;invention of British literature&quot; by Scottish writers. English writers, if they considered Britain at all, tended to assume it was merely England writ large; Scottish writers were more clearly aware of the new state as a &quot;cultural amalgam comprising more than just England&quot;. James Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Rule Britannia!&quot; is an example of the Scottish championing of this new national and literary identity. With the invention of British literature came the development of the early British novels, in contrast to the English novel of the 18th century which continued to deal with England and English concerns rather than exploring the changed political, social and literary environment. Tobias Smollett (1721–71) was a Scottish pioneer of the British novel, exploring the prejudices inherent within the new social structure of the country through comic picaresque novels. His &quot;The Adventures of Roderick Random&quot; (1748) is the first major novel written in English to have a Scotsman as hero, and the multinational voices represented in the narrative confront Anti-Scottish sentiment, being published only two years after the Battle of Culloden. &quot;The Expedition of Humphry Clinker&quot; (1771) brings together characters from the extremes of Britain to question how cultural and linguistic differences can be accommodated within the new British identity, and influenced Charles Dickens. Richard Cumberland wrote patriotic comedies depicting characters taken from the &quot;outskirts of the empire,&quot;. His most popular play &quot;The West Indian&quot; (1771) was performed in North America and the West Indies.

====Prose, including the novel====

In prose, the earlier part of the period was overshadowed by the development of the English essay. Joseph Addison and Richard Steele&#x27;s &quot;The Spectator&quot; established the form of the British periodical essay, inventing the pose of the detached observer of human life who can meditate upon the world without advocating any specific changes in it. However, this was also the time when the English novel, first emerging in the Restoration, developed into a major art form. Daniel Defoe turned from journalism and writing criminal lives for the press to writing fictional criminal lives with &quot;&quot; and &quot;Moll Flanders.&quot;

The English novel has generally been seen as beginning with Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1719) and &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; (1722), though John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1678) and Aphra Behn&#x27;s, &quot;Oroonoko&quot; (1688) are also contenders. Other major 18th-century British novelists are Samuel Richardson (1689–1761), author of the epistolary novels &quot;Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded&quot; (1740) and &quot;Clarissa; or, The History of a Young Lady&quot; (1747–48); Henry Fielding (1707–54), who wrote &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; (1742) and &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; (1749).

If Addison and Steele were dominant in one type of prose, then Jonathan Swift author of the satire &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; was in another. In &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; and the &quot;Drapier Letters&quot;, Swift reluctantly defended the Irish people from the predations of colonialism. This position provoked riots and arrests, but Swift, who had no love of Irish Roman Catholics, was outraged by the abuses he saw.

The English pictorial satirist and editorial cartoonist William Hogarth (1697–1764) has been credited with pioneering Western sequential art. His work ranged from realistic portraiture to comic strip-like series of pictures called &quot;modern moral subjects&quot;. Much of his work satirises contemporary politics and customs.

====Drama====
Although documented history of Irish theatre began at least as early as 1601, the early Irish dramatists of note were William Congreve (1670–1729), one of the more interesting writers of Restoration comedies and author of &quot;The Way of the World&quot; (1700) and playwright, George Farquhar (?1677–1707), &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; (1706). (Restoration comedy refers to English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from 1660 to 1710. Comedy of manners is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy).

Anglo-Irish drama in the 18th century also includes Charles Macklin (?1699–1797), and Arthur Murphy (1727–1805).

The age of Augustan drama was brought to an end by the censorship established by the Licensing Act 1737. After 1737, authors with strong political or philosophical points to make would no longer turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living, and novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings, as the stage was closed off for serious authors. Prior to the Licensing Act 1737, theatre was the first choice for most wits. After it, the novel was

====Poetry====
The most outstanding poet of the age is Alexander Pope (1688–1744), whose major works include: &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot; (1712; enlarged in 1714); a translation of the &quot;Iliad&quot; (1715–20); a translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (1725–26); &quot;The Dunciad&quot; (1728; 1743). Since his death, Pope has been in a constant state of re-evaluation. His high artifice, strict prosody, and, at times, the sheer cruelty of his satire were an object of derision for the Romantic poets, and it was not until the 1930s that his reputation was revived. Pope is now considered the dominant poetic voice of his century, a model of prosodic elegance, biting wit, and an enduring, demanding moral force. The &quot;Rape of the Lock&quot; and &quot;The Dunciad&quot; are masterpieces of the mock-epic genre.

It was during this time that poet James Thomson (1700–48) produced his melancholy &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1728–30) and Edward Young (1681–1765) wrote his poem &quot;Night-Thoughts&quot; (1742).

===The roots of Romanticism: 1750–1798===

The second half of the 18th century is sometimes called the &quot;Age of Johnson&quot;. Samuel Johnson (1709–1784), often referred to as Dr Johnson, was an English author who made lasting contributions to English literature as a poet, essayist, moralist, literary critic, biographer, editor and lexicographer. Johnson has been described as &quot;arguably the most distinguished man of letters in English history&quot;. After nine years of work, Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot; was published in 1755; it had a far-reaching effect on Modern English and has been described as &quot;one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship.&quot;. Through works such as the &quot;Dictionary, his edition of Shakespeare, and his &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot; in particular, he helped invent what we now call English Literature&quot;.

This period of the 18th century saw the emergence of three major Irish authors Oliver Goldsmith (1728–1774), Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751–1816), and Laurence Sterne (1713–1768). Goldsmith settled in London in 1756, where he published the novel &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; (1766), a pastoral poem with the title &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; (1770) and two plays: &quot;The Good-Natur&#x27;d Man&quot; and &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;. Sheridan was born in Dublin, but his family moved to England in the 1750s. His first play &quot;The Rivals&quot; was performed at Covent Garden, and it was an instant success. He became the most significant London playwright of the late 18th century with plays like &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; and &quot;The Critic&quot;. Sterne published his famous novel &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; in parts from 1759 to 1767.

The sentimental novel or the novel of sensibility is a genre which developed during the second half of the 18th century. Among the famous sentimental novels in English are Samuel Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded&quot; (1740), Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; (1766), and Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; (1759–1767).

Another novel genre also developed in this period. In 1778, Frances Burney (1752–1840) wrote &quot;Evelina&quot;, one of the ear;y novels of manners. Fanny Burney&#x27;s novels indeed &quot;were enjoyed and admired by Jane Austen&quot;.

The graveyard poets were a number of pre-Romantic English poets, writing in the 1740s and later, whose works are characterised by their gloomy meditations on mortality, &quot;skulls and coffins, epitaphs and worms&quot; in the context of the graveyard. To this was added, by later practitioners, a feeling for the &#x27;sublime&#x27; and uncanny, and an interest in ancient English poetic forms and folk poetry. They are often considered precursors of the Gothic genre. The poets include; Thomas Gray (1716–71), &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot; (1751); William Cowper (1731–1800); Christopher Smart (1722–71); Thomas Chatterton (1752–70); Robert Blair (1699–1746); and Edward Young (1683–1765), &quot;The Complaint, or Night Thoughts on Life, Death and Immortality&quot; (1742–45).

Other precursors of Romanticism are the poets James Thomson (1700–48) and James Macpherson (1736–96), the Gothic novel and the novel of sensibility.

Also foreshadowing Romanticism was Gothic fiction, in works such as Horace Walpole&#x27;s 1764 novel &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;. The Gothic fiction genre combines elements of horror and romance. A pioneering Gothic novelist was Ann Radcliffe author of &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; (1794). &quot;The Monk&quot; (1796), by Matthew Lewis, is another notable early work in both the Gothic and horror genres.

James Macpherson (1736–96) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Both Robert Burns (1759–96) and Walter Scott (1771–1832) were highly influenced by the Ossian cycle.

Robert Burns (1759–1796) was a pioneer of the Romantic movement, and after his death, he became a cultural icon in Scotland. Among poems and songs of Burns that remain well known across the world are &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;; &quot;A Red, Red Rose&quot;; &quot;A Man&#x27;s A Man for A&#x27; That&quot;; &quot;To a Mouse&quot;; &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot; and &quot;Ae Fond Kiss&quot;.

==Romanticism: 1798–1837==

Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century. Various dates are given for the Romantic period in British literature, but here the publishing of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; in 1798 is taken as the beginning, and the crowning of Queen Victoria in 1837 as its end, even though, for example, William Wordsworth lived until 1850 and William Blake published before 1798. The writers of this period, however, &quot;did not think of themselves as &#x27;Romantics&#x27;&quot;, and the term was first used by critics of the Victorian period.

The Romantic period was one of major social change in England, because of the depopulation of the countryside and the rapid development of overcrowded industrial cities, that took place in the period roughly from 1785 to 1830. The movement of so many people in England was the result of two forces: the Agricultural Revolution, that involved the enclosure of the land, drove workers off the land, and the Industrial Revolution which provided them employment, &quot;in the factories and mills, operated by machines driven by steam-power&quot;. Indeed, Romanticism may be seen in part as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, though it was also a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, as well a reaction against the scientific rationalisation of nature. The French Revolution was an especially important influence on the political thinking of many of the Romantic poets.

The landscape is often prominent in the poetry of this period, so that the Romantics, especially perhaps Wordsworth, are often described as &#x27;nature poets&#x27;. However, the longer Romantic &#x27;nature poems&#x27; have a wider concern because they are usually meditations on &quot;an emotional problem or personal crisis&quot;.

===Romantic poetry===

The poet, painter, and printmaker William Blake (1757–1827) was one of the early of the English Romantic poets. Largely disconnected from the major streams of the literature of the time, Blake was generally unrecognised during his lifetime, but is now considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age. Among his important works are &quot;Songs of Innocence&quot; (1789) and &quot;Songs of Experience&quot; (1794) &quot;and profound and difficult &#x27;prophecies&#x27;&quot; such as &quot;Visions of the Daughters of Albion&quot; (1793), &quot;The First Book of Urizen&quot; (1794), and &quot;Jerusalem: the Emanation of the Giant Albion&quot; (1804–?20).

After Blake, among the early Romantics were the Lake Poets, a small group of friends, including William Wordsworth (1770–1850), Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), Robert Southey (1774–1843) and journalist Thomas De Quincey (1785–1859). However, at the time, Walter Scott (1771–1832) was the most famous poet. Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot; in 1805, followed by the full epic poem &quot;Marmion&quot; in 1808. Both were set in the distant Scottish past.

The early Romantic Poets brought a new emotionalism and introspection, and their emergence is marked by the first romantic manifesto in English literature, the &quot;Preface&quot; to &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; (1798). The poems in &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; were mostly by Wordsworth, but Coleridge contributed the long &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;. Among Wordsworth&#x27;s important poems, are &quot;Michael&quot;, &quot;Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey&quot;, &quot;Resolution and Independence&quot;, &quot;&quot; and the autobiographical epic &quot;The Prelude&quot;.

Robert Southey (1774–1843) was another of the so-called &quot;Lake Poets&quot;, and Poet Laureate for 30 years from 1813 to his death in 1843. Although his fame has been eclipsed by that of his contemporaries and friends William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Thomas De Quincey (1785–1859) was an English essayist, best known for his &quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&quot; (1821), an autobiographical account of his laudanum and its effect on his life.

====Second generation====

The second generation of Romantic poets includes Lord Byron (1788–1824), Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822) and John Keats (1795–1821). Byron, however, was still influenced by 18th-century satirists and was, perhaps, the least &quot;romantic&quot; of the three, preferring &quot;the brilliant wit of Pope to what he called the &#x27;wrong poetical system&#x27; of his Romantic contemporaries&quot;.

Though John Keats shared Byron and Shelley&#x27;s radical politics, &quot;his best poetry is not political&quot;. but is especially noted for its sensuous music and imagery, along with a concern with material beauty and the transience of life. Among his famous works are: &quot;The Eve of St Agnes&quot;, &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot;, &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;, &quot;To Autumn&quot;.

Percy Shelley, known to contemporaries for his radical politics and association with figures such as Byron and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, daughter of radical thinkers William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, was the third major romantic poet of the second generation. Generally regarded as among the great lyric poets in the English language, Shelley is perhaps best known for poems such as &quot;Ozymandias&quot;, &quot;Ode to the West Wind&quot;, &quot;To a Skylark&quot; and &quot;Adonaïs&quot;, an elegy written on the death of Keats. Mary Shelley (1797–1851) is remembered as the author of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818), an important Gothic novel, as well as being an early example of science fiction.

Although sticking to its forms, Felicia Hemans began a process of undermining the Romantic tradition, a deconstruction that was continued by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, as &quot;an urban poet deeply attentive to themes of decay and decomposition&quot;. Landon&#x27;s novel forms of metrical romance and dramatic monologue were much copied and contributed to her long-lasting influence on Victorian poetry.

====Other poets====
Another important poet in this period was John Clare (1793–1864). Clare was the son of a farm labourer, who came to be known for his celebratory representations of the English countryside and his lamentation for the changes taking place in rural England.

George Crabbe (1754–1832) was an English poet who, during the Romantic period, wrote &quot;closely observed, realistic portraits of rural life...in the heroic couplets of the Augustan age&quot;. Crabbe&#x27;s works include &quot;The Village&quot; (1783), &quot;Poems&quot; (1807), &quot;The Borough&quot; (1810).

===Romanticism and the novel===
Major novelists in this period were Jane Austen (1775–1817) and the Scotsman Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832), and Gothic fiction of various kinds also flourished. Austen&#x27;s works satirise the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. Austen&#x27;s works include &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1813) &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (1811), &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; (1814), &quot;Emma&quot; (1815)&quot; and Persuasion&quot; (1818).

The most important British novelist at the beginning of the early 19th century was Sir Walter Scott, who was not only a highly successful British novelist, but &quot;the greatest single influence on fiction in the 19th century...[and] a European figure&quot;. Scott&#x27;s novel writing career was launched in 1814 with &quot;Waverley&quot;, often called the first historical novel, and was followed by &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. The Waverley Novels, including &quot;The Antiquary&quot;, &quot;Old Mortality&quot;, &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot;, and whose subject is Scottish history, are now generally regarded as Scott&#x27;s masterpieces.

==Victorian literature: 1837–1900==
===Victorian fiction===
====The novel====
It was in the Victorian era (1837–1900) that the novel became the leading literary genre in English. Women played an important part in this rising popularity both as authors and as readers. Monthly serialising of fiction encouraged this surge in popularity, due to a combination of the rise of literacy, technological advances in printing, and improved economics of distribution. Circulating libraries, that allowed books to be borrowed for an annual subscription, were a further factor in the rising popularity of the novel.

Charles Dickens (1812–70) emerged on the literary scene in the late 1830s and soon became probably the most famous novelist in the history of British literature. Dickens fiercely satirised various aspects of society, including the workhouse in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, the failures of the legal system in &quot;Bleak House&quot;. In more recent years, Dickens has been most admired for his later novels, such as &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1846–1848), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1852–1853) and &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1855–1857), &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1860–1861), and &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; (1864–1865).

An early rival to Dickens was William Makepeace Thackeray (1811–1863), who during the Victorian period ranked second only to him, but he is now much less read and is known almost exclusively for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (1847).

The Brontë sisters, Emily, Charlotte and Anne, were other significant novelists in the 1840s and 1850s. Their novels caused a sensation when they were first published and subsequently were accepted as classics. Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s (1816–1855) work was &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, broke new ground in being written from an intensely first-person female perspective. Emily Brontë&#x27;s (1818–1848) novel was &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and, according to Juliet Gardiner, &quot;the vivid sexual passion and power of its language and imagery impressed, bewildered and appalled reviewers&quot;. The third Brontë novel of 1847 was Anne Brontë&#x27;s (1820–1849) &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, which deals with the lonely life of a governess.

Elizabeth Gaskell (1810–1865) was also a successful writer and &quot;North and South&quot; contrasts the lifestyle in the industrial north of England with the wealthier south.

Anthony Trollope (1815–1882) was one of the more successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era. Some of his works are set in the imaginary west country county of Barsetshire, including &quot;The Warden&quot; (1855) and &quot;Barchester Towers&quot; (1857). Trollope&#x27;s novels portray the lives of the landowning and professional classes of early Victorian England.

George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans (1819–1880) was a major novelist of the mid-Victorian period. Her works, especially &quot;Middlemarch&quot; 1871–1872), are important examples of literary realism, and they are admired for their combination of high Victorian literary detail, with an intellectual breadth that removes them from the narrow geographic confines they often depict, leading to comparisons with Tolstoy.

George Meredith (1828–1909) is best remembered for his novels &quot;The Ordeal of Richard Feverel&quot; (1859) and &quot;The Egoist&quot; (1879). &quot;His reputation stood very high well into&quot; the 20th century but then seriously declined.
An interest in rural matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside is seen in the novels of Thomas Hardy (1840–1928). A Victorian realist, in the tradition of George Eliot, he was also influenced both in his novels and poetry by Romanticism, especially by William Wordsworth. He gained fame as the author of such novels as, &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1874), &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; (1886), &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; (1891), and &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; (1895).

Another significant late 19th-century novelist is George Gissing (1857–1903), who published 23 novels from 1880 to 1903. His best-known novel is &quot;New Grub Street&quot; (1891).

Also in the late 1890s, the Polish-born writer Joseph Conrad (1857–1924), an important forerunner of modernist literature, began publishing his first novels. Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; was published in 1899. Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (1899) is an important example about the changing times during Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign, signaling the transition from realism to modernism. While Conrad&#x27;s depiction of the local Africans in his novel is often criticized as deeply dehumanizing (for example, Chinua Achebe in &quot;An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad&#x27;s Heart of Darkness&quot;), others argue that this xenophobic characterization belongs to the fictional narrator (Charles Marlow), and that Conrad seeks to blur the lines between societies, demonstrating the ambiguity and darkness inherent in each. Another major novel of Conrad&#x27;s published towards the end of the Victorian era was &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1900). Considered one of his masterpieces, &quot;Lord Jim&quot; also makes use of the narration of the character Marlow to tell the story of a disgraced young sailor who seeks to make amends for abandoning a steamer and its passengers during its moment of need. &quot;Lord Jim&quot; has also been praised for its innovative psychological exploration of cowardice, self knowledge, and personal growth, as well as its experimental narrative structure anticipating literary modernism. As with &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, the novel has also been notable for casting doubts on the assumptions of the colonial order of the day.

====The short story====
There are early European examples of short stories published separately from 1790 to 1810, but the first true collections of short stories appeared from 1810 to 1830 in several countries around the same period. The early short stories in the United Kingdom were gothic tales like Richard Cumberland&#x27;s &quot;remarkable narrative&quot; &quot;The Poisoner of Montremos&quot; (1791). Major novelists like Sir Walter Scott and Charles Dickens also wrote some short stories.

====Genre fiction====
Important developments occurred in genre fiction in this era.

Adventure novels were popular, including Sir John Barrow&#x27;s descriptive 1831 account of the Mutiny on the Bounty. The Lost World literary genre was inspired by real stories of archaeological discoveries by imperial adventurers. Sir Henry Rider Haggard wrote &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, one of the early examples, in 1885. Contemporary European politics and diplomatic manoeuvrings informed Anthony Hope&#x27;s swashbuckling Ruritanian adventure novels &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1894). Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–1894) also wrote works in this genre, including &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1886), an historical novel set in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745, and &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883), the classic pirate adventure.

Wilkie Collins&#x27; epistolary novel &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868) is generally considered the first detective novel in the English language, and soon after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle began his Sherlock Holmes series about a London-based &quot;consulting detective&quot;. Doyle wrote four novels and 56 short stories featuring Holmes, from 1880 to 1907, with a final case in 1914.

H. G. Wells&#x27;s (1866–1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1898), which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians, and Wells is, along with Frenchman Jules Verne (1828–1905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre.

The history of the modern fantasy genre is generally said to begin with George MacDonald, the influential author of &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot; and &quot;Phantastes&quot; (1858). William Morris was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the 19th century. The vampire genre fiction began with John William Polidori&#x27;s &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of Lord Byron and his poem &quot;The Giaour&quot;. Irish writer Bram Stoker was the author of seminal horror work &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897) with the primary antagonist the vampire Count Dracula.

Penny dreadful publications were an alternative to mainstream works, and were aimed at working class adolescents, introducing the infamous Sweeney Todd. The premier ghost story writer of the 19th century was the Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu.

====Children&#x27;s literature====

Literature for children developed as a separate genre during the Victorian era, and some works became internationally known, such as Lewis Carroll, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865). At the end of 19th century, the author and illustrator Beatrix Potter was known for her children&#x27;s books, which featured animal characters, including &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot; (1902). In the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern picture book were illustrated books of poems and short stories produced by illustrators Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane, and Kate Greenaway. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. &quot;Vice Versa&quot; (1882) by F. Anstey, sees a father and son exchange bodies – body swaps have been a popular theme in various media since the book was published.

===Victorian poetry===

The leading poets during the Victorian period were Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892), Robert Browning (1812–1889), Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806–1861), and Matthew Arnold (1822–1888). The poetry of this period was heavily influenced by the Romantics, but went off in its own directions. Particularly notable was the development of the dramatic monologue, a form used by many poets in this period, but perfected by Browning.

Tennyson was Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom during much of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign. He was described by T.S. Eliot, as &quot;the greatest master of metrics as well as melancholia&quot;, and as having &quot;the finest ear of any English poet since Milton&quot;.

While Elizabeth Barrett Browning was the wife of Robert Browning, she had established her reputation as a major poet before she met him. Her famous work is the sequence of 44 sonnets &quot;Sonnets from the Portuguese&quot;, published in &quot;Poems&quot; (1850). Matthew Arnold&#x27;s reputation as a poet has declined in recent years, and he is best remembered now for his critical works, like &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot; (1869) and his 1867 poem &quot;Dover Beach&quot;.

Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882) was a poet, illustrator, painter and translator. He founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848 with William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, and was later to be the main inspiration for a second generation of artists and writers influenced by the movement, notably William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones.

While Arthur Clough (1819–61) was a minor figure of this era, he has been described as &quot;a fine poet whose experiments in extending the range of literary language and subject were ahead of his time&quot;.

George Meredith (1828–1909) is remembered for his innovative collection of poems &quot;Modern Love&quot; (1862).

In the second half of the century, English poets began to take an interest in French Symbolism. Two groups of poets emerged in the 1890s, the &quot;Yellow Book&quot; poets who adhered to the tenets of Aestheticism, including Algernon Charles Swinburne, Oscar Wilde and Arthur Symons and the Rhymers&#x27; Club group, that included Ernest Dowson, Lionel Johnson and Irishman William Butler Yeats. Irishman Yeats went on to become an important modernist in the 20th century. Also in the 1890s A. E. Housman (1859–1936) published at his own expense &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. The poems&#x27; wistful evocation of doomed youth in the English countryside, in spare language and distinctive imagery, appealed strongly to late Victorian and Edwardian taste.

The nonsense verse of Edward Lear, along with the novels and poems of Lewis Carroll, is regarded as a precursor of surrealism. In 1846, Lear published &quot;A Book of Nonsense&quot;, a volume of limericks that went through three editions and helped popularise the form.

Writers of comic verse included the dramatist, librettist, poet and illustrator W. S. Gilbert (1836–1911), who is best known for his 14 comic operas produced in collaboration with the composer Sir Arthur Sullivan, of which the famous include &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;, &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;.

===Victorian drama===

For much of the first half of the 19th century, drama in London and provincial theatres was restricted by a licensing system to the Patent theatre companies, and all other theatres could perform only musical entertainments (although magistrates had powers to license occasional dramatic performances). The passing of the Theatres Act 1843 removed the monopoly on drama held by the Patent theatres.

Irish playwright Dion Boucicault (1820–90) was an extremely popular writer of comedies who achieved success on the London stage with works like &quot;London Assurance&quot;, (1841), in the middle of the 19th century. However, drama did not achieve importance as a genre in the 19th century until the end of the century, and then the main figures were also Irish-born. In the last decade of the century major playwrights emerged, including George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950), &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; (1894), and Oscar Wilde (1854–1900), &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1895). Both of these Irish writers lived mainly in England and wrote in English, with the exception of some works in French by Wilde.

==20th century==
The year 1922 marked a significant change in the relationship between Great Britain and Ireland, with the setting up of the (predominantly Catholic) Irish Free State in most of Ireland, and the predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. This separation also leads to questions as to what extent Irish writing prior to 1922 should be treated as a colonial literature. There are also those who question whether the literature of Northern Ireland is Irish or British. Nationalist movements in Britain, especially in Wales and Scotland, also significantly influenced writers in the 20th and 21st centuries.

===Modernism and cultural revivals: 1901–1945===
From around 1910 the Modernist movement began to influence British literature. While their Victorian predecessors had usually been happy to cater to mainstream middle-class taste, 20th-century writers often felt alienated from it, so responded by writing more intellectually challenging works or by pushing the boundaries of acceptable content.

==== Edwardian fiction ====
The short but influential Edwardian era emerged with the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 and continued until the First World War. During this time, the world was introduced to cozy and puckish animal characters of Beatrix Potter along with the eternally youthful antics of Peter Pan (J. M. Barrie). A. A. Milne also began to write during this time, but his beloved Winnie the Pooh would not be published until 1926. Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories For Little Children&quot; (1902) was a successful followup to his earlier adventures with Mowgli and The Jungle Book (1894).

Other exemplary novels of the time take on an optimistic but critical tone, including E.M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1908)&quot;.&quot; Here, Forster satirizes the classism and xenophobia of Victorian England, using his own travel experiences to question the &quot;ingrained bias[es]&quot; of the previous century. The Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement was also gaining momentum during this era and fiction reflected these ideas. More than ever, fictional women were protagonists (not just supporting roles), and they often crossed social and geographical boundaries through marriage or the pursuit of knowledge.

Joseph Conrad, who started writing during the Victorian era, continued to produce important novels into the Edwardian period. &quot;Nostromo&quot; (1904), long regarded as one of his finest novels, deals with the corrupting impact about wealth on a revolutionary society in a fictional South American country.

====First World War====
The experiences of the First World War were reflected in the work of war poets such as Wilfred Owen, Rupert Brooke, Isaac Rosenberg, Robert Graves, and Siegfried Sassoon. &quot;In Parenthesis&quot;, an epic poem by David Jones first published in 1937, is a notable work of the literature of the First World War, that was influenced by Welsh traditions, despite Jones being born in England. In non-fiction prose T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s (Lawrence of Arabia) autobiographical account in &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire is important.

====Poetry: 1901–1945====

Thomas Hardy (1840–1928) and Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844–1889), two Victorian poets who published little in the 19th century, have come to be regarded as major poets. While Hardy first established his reputation the late 19th century with novels, he wrote poetry throughout his career. However he did not publish his first collection until 1898, so that he tends to be treated as a 20th-century poet. Gerard Manley Hopkins&#x27;s &quot;Poems&quot; were posthumously published in 1918 by Robert Bridges.

Free verse and other stylistic innovations came to the forefront in this era, with which T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound were especially associated. T. S. Eliot (1888–1965) was born American, migrating to England in 1914, and he was &quot;arguably the most important English-language poet of the 20th century.&quot; He produced some of the best-known poems in the English language, including &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922) and &quot;Four Quartets&quot; (1935–1942).

The Georgian poets like Rupert Brooke, Walter de la Mare (1873–1956) and John Masefield (1878–1967, Poet Laureate from 1930) maintained a conservative approach to poetry by combining romanticism, sentimentality and hedonism. Edward Thomas (1878–1917) is sometimes treated as another Georgian poet.

In the 1930s the Auden Group, sometimes called simply &quot;the Thirties poets&quot;, was an important group of politically left-wing writers, that included W.H. Auden (1907–73) and Cecil Day-Lewis (1904–1972) and Louis MacNeice (1907–1963). Auden was a major poet who had a similar influence on subsequent poets as W.B. Yeats and T.S. Eliot had had on earlier generations.

Keith Douglas (1920–1944) was noted for his war poetry during World War II and his wry memoir of the Western Desert Campaign, &quot;Alamein to Zem Zem&quot;. He was killed in action during the invasion of Normandy. Alun Lewis (1915–1944), born in South Wales, was a prominent English-language poet of the war The Second World War has remained a theme in British literature.

====Modernist novel====

While modernism was to become an important literary movement in the early decades of the new century, there were also many fine writers who, like Thomas Hardy, were not modernists. Novelists include: Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936), who was also a successful poet; H. G. Wells (1866–1946); John Galsworthy (1867–1933), (Nobel Prize in Literature, 1932), whose novels include &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (1906–1921); Arnold Bennett (1867–1931) author of &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot; (1908); G. K. Chesterton (1874–1936); E. M. Forster (1879–1970). The most popular British writer of the early years of the 20th century was arguably Rudyard Kipling, a highly versatile writer of novels, short stories and poems, and to date the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature (1907).

H. G. Wells was a highly prolific author who is now best known for his work in the science fiction genre. His notable science fiction works include &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, and &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, written in the 1890s. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Passage to India&quot; 1924, reflected challenges to imperialism, and his earlier works such as &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1908) and &quot;Howards End&quot; (1910) examined the restrictions and hypocrisy of Edwardian society in England.
Writing in the 1920s and 1930s Virginia Woolf was an influential feminist and a major stylistic innovator associated with the stream-of-consciousness technique. Her novels include &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; 1925, and &quot;The Waves&quot; 1931, and &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; 1929, which contains her famous dictum: &quot;A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction&quot;. Woolf and E. M. Forster were members of the Bloomsbury Group, an enormously influential group of English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists.
Other early modernists were Dorothy Richardson (1873–1957), whose novel &quot;Pointed Roof&quot; (1915), is one of the early example of the stream of consciousness technique and D. H. Lawrence (1885–1930), who wrote with understanding about the social life of the lower and middle classes, and the personal life of those who could not adapt to the social norms of his time. &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; 1913, is widely regarded as his earliest masterpiece. There followed &quot;The Rainbow&quot; in 1915 and its sequel &quot;Women in Love&quot; in 1920.

An important development, beginning really in the 1930s and 1940s, was a tradition of working class novels that were actually written by writers who had a working-class background.

An essayist and novelist, George Orwell&#x27;s works are considered important social and political commentaries of the 20th century, dealing with issues such as poverty in &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; (1937) and in the 1940s, his satires of totalitarianism included &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (1945). Malcolm Lowry published in the 1930s, and he is best known for &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; (1947). Evelyn Waugh satirised the &quot;bright young things&quot; of the 1920s and 1930s, notably in &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; and &quot;Decline and Fall&quot;, and his novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; has a theological basis, aiming to examine the effect of divine grace on its main characters. Aldous Huxley (1894–1963) published his famous dystopia &quot;Brave New World&quot; in 1932, the same year as John Cowper Powys&#x27;s &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot;. In 1938, Graham Greene&#x27;s (1904–1991) first major novel &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; was published.

===Late modernism: 1946–2000===

Though some have seen modernism ending by around 1939, with regard to English literature, &quot;When (if) modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to modernism occurred&quot;. In fact a number of modernists were still living and publishing in the 1950s and 1960, including T.S. Eliot, Dorothy Richardson and John Cowper Powys. Furthermore, Northumberland poet Basil Bunting, born in 1901, published little until &quot;Briggflatts&quot; in 1965.

====Novel====
In 1947 Malcolm Lowry published &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;. George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; was published in 1949. An essayist and novelist, Orwell&#x27;s works are important social and political commentaries of the 20th century. Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s Second World War trilogy &quot;Sword of Honour&quot; (1952–1961) was published in this period.

Graham Greene&#x27;s works span the 1930s to the 1980s. He was a convert to Catholicism, and his novels explore the ambivalent moral and political issues of the modern world. Other novelists writing in the 1950s and later were: Anthony Powell, &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;; Nobel Prize laureate Sir William Golding; philosopher Dame Iris Murdoch, whose novels deal with sexual relationships, morality, and the power of the unconscious; and Scottish novelist Muriel Spark, &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1961). Anthony Burgess is remembered for his dystopian novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; 1962. Mervyn Peake (1911–1968) published his Gothic fantasy Gormenghast trilogy from 1946 to 1959. Angela Carter (1940–1992) was a novelist and journalist, known for her feminist, magical realism, and picaresque works.
Sir Salman Rushdie is among a number of writers from former British colonies who permanently settled in Britain. Rushdie achieved fame with &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; (1981). His controversial novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; (1989) was inspired in part by the life of Muhammad.

Doris Lessing from Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) published her first novel &quot;The Grass Is Singing&quot; in 1950 after immigrating to England. She initially wrote about her African experiences. Lessing soon became a dominant presence in the English literary scene, publishing frequently, and she won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2007. Sir V. S. Naipaul (1932–2018) was another immigrant, born in Trinidad, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Also from the West Indies is George Lamming (1927–2022) who wrote &quot;In the Castle of My Skin&quot; (1953), and from Pakistan came Hanif Kureshi (1954–), a playwright, screenwriter, filmmaker, novelist and short story writer. 2017 Nobel Prize winner Kazuo Ishiguro (1954– ) was born in Japan, but his parents immigrated to Britain when he was age 6, and he became a British citizen as an adult. Martin Amis (1949–2023) was one of the prominent British novelists of the end of the 20th, beginning of the 21st century. Pat Barker (1943–) has won many awards for her fiction. English novelist and screenwriter Ian McEwan (1948– ) is a highly regarded writer.

====Drama====
An important cultural movement in the British theatre that developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s was Kitchen sink realism (or kitchen sink drama), art, novels, film, and television plays. The term angry young men was often applied members of this artistic movement. It used a style of social realism which depicts the domestic lives of the working class to explore social issues and political issues. The drawing room plays of the post war period, typical of dramatists like Sir Terence Rattigan and Sir Noël Coward, were challenged in the 1950s in plays like John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1956).

Again in the 1950s, the Theatre of the Absurd profoundly affected British dramatists, especially Irishman Samuel Beckett&#x27;s play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. Among those influenced were Harold Pinter (1930–2008), (&quot;The Birthday Party&quot;, 1958), and Tom Stoppard (1937– ) (&quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;,1966).

The Theatres Act 1968 abolished the system of censorship of the stage that had existed in Great Britain since 1737. The new freedoms of the London stage were tested by Howard Brenton&#x27;s &quot;The Romans in Britain&quot;, first staged at the National Theatre during 1980, and subsequently the focus of an unsuccessful private prosecution in 1982.

Other playwrights whose careers began later in the century are Sir Alan Ayckbourn (&quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot;, 1972), Michael Frayn (1933–) playwright and novelist, David Hare (1947– ), David Edgar (1948– ). Dennis Potter&#x27;s more distinctive dramatic work was produced for television.

During the 1950s and 1960s, many major British playwrights either effectively began their careers with the BBC, or had works adapted for radio. Many major British playwrights in fact, either effectively began their careers with the BBC, or had works adapted for radio, including Caryl Churchill and Tom Stoppard whose &quot;first professional production was in the fifteen-minute &quot;Just Before Midnight&quot; programme on BBC Radio, which showcased new dramatists&quot;. John Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955, with his adaptation of his own novel &quot;Like Men Betrayed&quot; for the BBC Light Programme. Other notable radio dramatists included Brendan Behan and novelist Angela Carter.

Among the more famous works created for radio, are Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; (1954), Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;All That Fall&quot; (1957), Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;A Slight Ache&quot; (1959) and Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (1954).

====Poetry====
While poets T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas were still publishing after 1945, new poets started their careers in the 1950s and 1960s, including Philip Larkin (1922–1885) (&quot;The Whitsun Weddings&quot;,1964) and Ted Hughes (1930–1998) (&quot;The Hawk in the Rain&quot;, 1957). Northern Ireland has produced a number of significant poets, the most famous being Nobel prize winner Seamus Heaney. However, Heaney regarded himself as Irish and not British. Others poets from Northern Ireland include Derek Mahon, Paul Muldoon, James Fenton, Michael Longley, and Medbh McGuckian.

In the 1960s and 1970s Martian poetry aimed to break the grip of &#x27;the familiar&#x27; by describing ordinary things in unfamiliar ways, for example, through the eyes of a Martian. Poets closely associated with it are Craig Raine and Christopher Reid. Martin Amis, an important novelist in the late 20th century, carried into fiction this drive to make the familiar strange. Another literary movement in this period was the British Poetry Revival, a wide-reaching collection of groupings and subgroupings that embraces performance, sound and concrete poetry. Leading poets associated with this movement include J. H. Prynne, Eric Mottram, Tom Raworth, Denise Riley and Lee Harwood. It reacted to the conservative group called &quot;The Movement&quot;.

The Liverpool poets were Adrian Henri, Brian Patten and Roger McGough. Their works were self-conscious attempts at creating an English equivalent to the Beats. Tony Harrison (1937 – ), who explores the medium of language and the tension between native dialect (in his case, that of working-class Leeds) and acquired language, and Simon Armitage.

Geoffrey Hill (1932–2016) has been considered to be among the distinguished English poets of his generation, Charles Tomlinson (1927–2015) is another important English poet of an older generation, but &quot;since his first publication in 1951, has built a career that has seen more notice in the international scene than in his native England.

====Scottish literature====
Scotland has in the late 20th century produced several important novelists, including James Kelman who like Samuel Beckett can create humour out of grim situations; A. L. Kennedy whose 2007 novel &quot;Day&quot; was named Book of the Year in the Costa Book Awards.; Alasdair Gray whose &quot;&quot; (1981) is a dystopian fantasy set in his home town Glasgow.

Highly anglicised Lowland Scots is often used in contemporary Scottish fiction, for example, the Edinburgh dialect of Lowland Scots used in &quot;Trainspotting&quot; by Irvine Welsh to give a brutal depiction of the lives of working class Edinburgh drug users. In Northern Ireland, James Fenton&#x27;s poetry is written in contemporary Ulster Scots. The poet Michael Longley (born 1939) has experimented with Ulster Scots for the translation of Classical verse, as in his 1995 collection &quot;The Ghost Orchid&quot;.

===Genre fiction===
====Early 20th century====
Among significant writers in this genre in the early 20th century were Erskine Childers&#x27; &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; (1903), who wrote spy novels, Emma Orczy (Baroness Orczy) author of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, an historical romance which recounted the adventures of a member of the English gentry in the French Revolutionary period. The title character established the notion of a &quot;hero with a secret identity&quot; into popular culture. John Buchan wrote adventure novels like &quot;Prester John&quot; (1910). Novels featuring a gentleman adventurer were popular between the wars, exemplified by the series of H. C. McNeile with &quot;Bulldog Drummond&quot; (1920), and Leslie Charteris, whose many books chronicled the adventures of Simon Templar, alias &quot;The Saint&quot;.

The medieval scholar M. R. James wrote highly regarded ghost stories in contemporary settings.

This was called &#x27;the Golden Age of Detective Fiction&#x27;. Dame Agatha Christie, a writer of crime novels, short stories and plays, is best remembered for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Other female writers in the genre of crime fiction include Dorothy L. Sayers (gentleman detective, Lord Peter Wimsey), Margery Allingham (Albert Campion – supposedly created as a parody of Sayers&#x27; Wimsey) and New Zealander Dame Ngaio Marsh (Roderick Alleyn). Georgette Heyer created the historical romance genre and also wrote detective fiction.

A major work of science fiction from the early 20th century is &quot;A Voyage to Arcturus&quot; by Scottish writer David Lindsay, first published in 1920, and was a central influence on C.S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Space Trilogy&quot;.
From the early 1930s to late 1940s, an informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford were &quot;The Inklings&quot;. Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists: J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. Lewis is known for &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; (1942), &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; and &quot;The Space Trilogy&quot;, and Tolkien is known as the author of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937), &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.

====Later 20th century====
Among important writers of genre fiction in the second half of the 20th century are thriller writer Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond 007. Fleming chronicled Bond&#x27;s adventures in 12 novels, including &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1953).

In contrast to the larger-than-life spy capers of Bond, John le Carré was an author of spy novels who depicted a shadowy world of espionage and counter-espionage, and his best known novel &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1963) is regarded as orominent in the genre.

Frederick Forsyth writes thriller novels, and Ken Follett writes spy thrillers as well as historical novels, notably &quot;The Pillars of the Earth&quot; (1989).

War novels include Alistair MacLean thriller&#x27;s &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1957), &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; (1968), and Jack Higgins&#x27; &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1975). Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s nautical historical novels feature the &quot;Aubrey–Maturin series&quot; set in the Royal Navy.

Ronald Welch&#x27;s Carnegie Medal winning novel &quot;Knight Crusader&quot; is set in the 12th century and gives a depiction of the Third Crusade, featuring the Christian leader and King of England Richard the Lionheart. Nigel Tranter also wrote historical novels of celebrated Scottish warriors; Robert the Bruce in &quot;The Bruce Trilogy&quot;.

The murder mysteries of both Ruth Rendell and P. D. James are popular crime fiction.

=====Science fiction=====

John Wyndham wrote post-apocalyptic science fiction, his notable works being &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; (1951), and &quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot; (1957). Other important writers in this genre are Sir Arthur C. Clarke &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and Brian Aldiss. Michael Moorcock was involved with the &#x27;New Wave&#x27; of science fiction writers &quot;part of whose aim was to invest the genre with literary merit&quot; Similarly J. G. Ballard (1930–2009) &quot;became known in the 1960s as the most prominent of the &#x27;New Wave&#x27; science fiction writers&quot;. A later major figure in science fiction was Iain M. Banks who created a fictional anarchist, socialist, and utopian society the Culture. Nobel prize winner Doris Lessing also published a sequence of five science fiction novels the &quot;Canopus in Argos: Archives&quot; from 1979 to 1983.

=====Fantasy=====
Sir Terry Pratchett is best known for his &quot;Discworld&quot; series of comic fantasy novels, that begins with &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; (1983), and includes &quot;Night Watch&quot; (2002). While Neil Gaiman is a writer of both science fiction, and fantasy including &quot;Stardust&quot; (1998). Douglas Adams is known for his five-volume science fiction comedy series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. J. R. R. Tolkien, arguably the most well-known author in the fantasy genre during the 20th century, is responsible for the creation of The Lord of the Rings (1954) and the wider Tolkien&#x27;s Legendarium.

===Literature for children and young adults===
Significant writers of works for children include, Kenneth Grahame, &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; (1908), Rev. W. Awdry, &quot;The Railway Series&quot; (1945–2011, A. A. Milne, &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; (1926), and P. L. Travers&#x27; &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;.

==21st-century literature==
===Novel===
In the 21st century, an outstanding concern with historical fiction has been noted. Dame Hilary Mantel (1952–2022) was a highly successful writer of historical novels, winning the Booker Prize twice for &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; 2009 and &quot;Bring Up the Bodies&quot;. One of the more ambitious novelists to emerge in this period is David Mitchell, whose far-reaching novel &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (2004) spans from the 19th century into the future. Influences from earlier literary styles and techniques in English literature is notable by writers such as Ian McEwan in his 2002 novel &quot;Atonement&quot;. Zadie Smith was critically acclaimed for her debut novel &quot;White Teeth&quot; (2000), and for subsequent novels. Julian Barnes (1946– ) is another prominent writer, and he won the 2011 Booker Prize for his book &quot;The Sense of an Ending&quot;. Kazuo Ishiguro was noted for works such as the dystopian science fiction-novel &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (2005), and he was awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Literature for his novels.

===Theatre===
The theatrical landscape has been reconfigured, moving from a single national theatre at the end of the 20th century to four as a result of the devolution of cultural policy.

===Genre fiction===
E. L. James&#x27; erotic romance trilogy &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;, &quot;Fifty Shades Darker&quot;, and &quot;Fifty Shades Freed&quot;, along with the companion novel &quot;&quot;, have sold over 100 million copies globally, and set the record in the United Kingdom as the fastest selling paperback of all time. The perceived success and promotion of genre fiction authors from Scotland provoked controversy in 2009 when James Kelman criticised, in a speech at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, the attention afforded to &quot;upper middle-class young magicians&quot; and &quot;detective fiction&quot; by the &quot;Anglocentric&quot; Scottish literary establishment.

===Literature for children and young adults===
Cressida Cowell wrote &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;, a series of 12 books set in a fictional Viking world. Philip Pullman&#x27;s is famous for his fantasy trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, which follows the coming-of-age of two children as they wander through a series of parallel universes against a backdrop of epic events.

Original literature continues to be promoted by institutions such as the Eisteddfod in Wales and the Welsh Books Council. The Royal Society of Edinburgh includes literature within its sphere of activity. Literature Wales is the Welsh national literature promotion agency and society of writers, which administers the Wales Book of the Year award. The imported eisteddfod tradition in the Channel Islands encouraged recitation and performance, a tradition that continues today.

Formed in 1949, the Cheltenham Literature Festival is the longest-running festival of its kind in the world. The Hay Festival in Wales attracts wide interest, and the Edinburgh International Book Festival is the largest festival of its kind in the world.

<text>In computing, the Perl DBI (Perl Database Interface) offers a standardized way for programmers using the Perl programming language to embed database communication within their programs. The latest DBI module for Perl from CPAN can run on a range of operating systems.

== History ==

In September 1992, Buzz Moschetti, creator of interperl, observed that several bespoke compiled extensions of perl (at the time, perl version 4 or more commonly perl4) featuring connectivity to popular SQL-based databases had emerged, namely Interbase, Informix, Oracle, and Sybase. He
engaged the authors of these bespoke versions with the idea of creating a common interface layer to the databases separate from the specifics of the underlying implementations. Tim Bunce took the lead and began specifying what would become the DBI module in 1994 upon the release of perl5 which eliminated the need for bespoke compilation in favor of dynamic, invocation time loading of libraries (modules). the Perl community maintains DBI as a CPAN module in accordance with the open-source model. DBD (DataBase Driver) modules serve as plug-ins to DBI, allowing programmers to use near-database-independent SQL code in their applications. Programmers can also use the DBI and DBD modules indirectly using one of the object-relational mappers available for Perl, such as , for more database-independent code with no need to write SQL.

== Features ==

The DBI and DBD Perl packages allow Perl programmers to access many database environments in a standard way. The system implements each supported database environment as a DBD driver, in much the same way that hardware devices from multiple vendors can operate with different CPU platforms. Prospective DBD users can download DBD implementations from the Internet. DBD implementations exist for proprietary products such as IBM Db2, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and for free-software databases such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, Firebird and MySQL.

== Similar projects ==

PHP 5 has a similar interface called PHP Data Objects (PDO). Java&#x27;s Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is also similar.

<text>John Joseph Sirica (March 19, 1904 – August 14, 1992) was a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where he became famous for his role in the trials stemming from the Watergate scandal.

==Early life and education==

Sirica was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, to Ferdinando (Fred) Sirica, an immigrant from Italy, and Rose (Zinno) Sirica, whose parents were from Italy. Between 1910 and 1918, the Sirica family lived in various cities across the United States, while Fred worked as a barber and made several unsuccessful attempts at running small businesses. The family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1918, where John attended Emerson Preparatory School and eventually transferred to Columbia Preparatory School. In 1922, Fred was running a two-lane bowling alley and poolhall, which was raided by the police for violation of the Prohibition-era Volstead Act when liquor was found in the restroom. Fred was arrested, but the charges were dropped. He soon sold the business and moved away.
Meanwhile, John went directly from high school to law school, which was possible in the District of Columbia at the time, and, after two false starts, entered Georgetown Law and received a Bachelor of Laws in 1926.

==Career==
Sirica fought as a boxer in Washington and Miami in the 1920s and 1930s. He was torn between a career as a boxer and the career in law that he followed after earning a law degree and passing the bar. Boxing champion Jack Dempsey became a close friend. Sirica was in private practice of law in Washington, D.C. from 1926 to 1930. He was an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 1930 to 1934, and returned to private practice from 1934 to 1957. He also served as general counsel to the House Select Committee to Investigate the Federal Communications Commission in 1944; his appointment was opposed by the two Republican members of the committee. Sirica resigned in protest over how the committee dealt with the WMCA radio scandal that year and re-entered private practice. In 1947, he joined the law firm of Hogan and Hartson in Washington, D.C. (now called Hogan Lovells).

==Federal judicial service==
Sirica was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on February 25, 1957, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia vacated by Judge Henry Albert Schweinhaut. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 26, 1957, and received his commission on March 28, 1957. He served as Chief Judge and a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1971 to 1974. He assumed senior status on October 31, 1977. His service terminated on his death on August 14, 1992.

Notably, he ruled the law banning Navy women from ships to be unconstitutional in the case &quot;Owens v. Brown&quot;.

===Watergate===

Sirica rose to national prominence when he ordered President Richard Nixon to surrender his recordings of White House conversations to Federal prosecutors. Sirica&#x27;s involvement in the case began when he presided over the trial of the Watergate burglars. He did not believe the claim that they had acted alone, and through the use of provisional sentencing strongly encouraged them to give information about higher-ups before final sentencing. Under provisional sentencing, judges could give defendants a few months to ponder their sentence before it became final. One defendant, James W. McCord Jr., wrote a letter describing a broader scheme of involvement by people in the Nixon administration.

===Judicial demeanor===
Experienced as a trial lawyer, Sirica was known for his &quot;no-nonsense&quot; demeanor on the bench. His critics said he lacked understanding of people and compassion, that he was guilty of careless legal errors, that he had a misguided view of the purposes of judicial power. Most of all, they attacked him for his conduct of the Watergate trial. He was nicknamed &quot;Maximum John&quot; for giving defendants the maximum sentence that guidelines allowed. 
==Book==
In 1979, Sirica published a book, co-authored with John Stacks, detailing his participation in the Watergate cases under the title &quot;To Set the Record Straight&quot;.

==Recognition==

For his role in uncovering the truth about Watergate, Sirica was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Man of the Year in January 1974.
In 1977, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Leon Jaworski.

==Death==
Sirica suffered a severe heart attack while at a speaking engagement on February 5, 1976. In the final years of his life, Sirica suffered from a wide range of ailments, both minor and severe. In the last few weeks of his life, he came down with pneumonia. He fell and broke his collarbone a few days before his death, and was hospitalized at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. He died in the hospital of cardiac arrest at 4:30 p.m. on August 14, 1992. He was interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland. Sirica was survived by his wife, Lucile Camalier Sirica, and his three children, John Jr., Patricia, and Eileen.

==In popular culture==
In the 2022 documentary, Watergate, Blueprint for a scandal by Herzog and Co. aired on CNN

In the 2023 HBO Max miniseries &quot;White House Plumbers&quot;, Sirica is portrayed by F. Murray Abraham.

<doc id="296558" wikidata="Q617871" url="?curid=296558" title="A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)">
<text>A Nightmare on Elm Street is an American supernatural slasher media franchise consisting of nine films, a television series, novels, comic books, and various other media. The franchise began with the film &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (1984), written and directed by Wes Craven. The overall plot of the franchise centers around the fictional character Freddy Krueger, the apparition of a former child killer who was burned alive by the vengeful parents of his victims, who returns from the grave to terrorize and kill the teenage residents of the fictional Springwood, Ohio in their dreams. Craven returned to the franchise to co-script the second sequel, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot; (1987), and to write and direct &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; (1994). The films collectively grossed $472 million at the box office worldwide.

The original film was released in 1984. A series of sequels produced by the independent film company New Line Cinema followed. New Line often attributes the growth of their company to the success of the &quot;Nightmare&quot; series. The film series as a whole has received mixed reviews by critics, but has been a financial success at the box office. When comparing the United States box office grosses of other American horror film series, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; is the third highest grossing series in adjusted US dollars. In 1988, a television series was produced with Freddy as the host. The pilot episode focused on the night Freddy was burned alive by the angry parents of the children he had killed, though the rest of the series featured episodes with independent plots. Twelve novels, separate from the adaptations of the films, and multiple comic book series were published featuring Freddy Krueger, as well as a crossover film featuring fellow horror icon Jason Voorhees from the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; franchise. A remake of the 1984 film was released in 2010, while a reboot is in development.

==Films==
===Overview===
The original film, written and directed by Wes Craven and titled &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;, was released in 1984. The story focuses on Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) attacking Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) and her friends in their dreams, successfully killing all but Nancy, in fictional Springwood, Ohio. Krueger&#x27;s backstory is revealed by Nancy&#x27;s mother, Marge, who explains that he was a child murderer. The parents of Springwood killed Krueger after he was acquitted on a technicality. Nancy defeats Freddy by pulling him from the dream world and stripping him of his powers when she stops being afraid of him.

Freddy returns to possess the body of Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton), the new teenager living in Nancy Thompson&#x27;s house, in 1985&#x27;s &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. Jesse is temporarily saved by his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Myers), who helps him exorcise Krueger&#x27;s spirit.

Wes Craven returned to write &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot;, released in 1987. In the second sequel, Freddy is systematically killing the last of the Elm Street children. The few remaining children have been placed in the Westin Hills Mental Institution for allegedly attempting suicide. Nancy Thompson arrives at Westin Hills as a new intern, and realizes the children are being killed by Freddy. With the help of Dr. Neil Gordon (Craig Wasson), Nancy helps Kristen Parker (Patricia Arquette), Joey (Rodney Eastman), Taryn (Jennifer Rubin), Kincaid (Ken Sagoes), and Will (Ira Heiden) find their dream powers, so they can kill Freddy once and for all. Neil, unknowingly until the end, meets the spirit of Freddy&#x27;s mother, Amanda Krueger (Nan Martin), who instructs him to bury Freddy&#x27;s remains in hallowed ground in order to stop him for good. Neil completes his task, but not before Freddy kills Nancy.

The story of Kristen Parker would continue with 1988&#x27;s &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot;. This time, Kristen (Tuesday Knight) unwittingly releases Freddy, who immediately kills Kincaid and Joey. Before Freddy can kill Kristen, she transfers her dream powers to Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox), a friend from school. Alice begins inadvertently providing victims for Freddy when she begins pulling people into her dreams while she sleeps. Alice, who begins taking on traits of the friends who were murdered, confronts Freddy. She uses the power of the Dream Master to release all the souls Freddy has taken; they subsequently rip themselves from Freddy&#x27;s body, killing him in the process.

Picking up shortly after the events of &quot;The Dream Master&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child&quot; involves Freddy using Alice&#x27;s unborn child, Jacob (Whitby Hertford), to resurrect himself and find new victims. The spirit of Amanda Krueger (Beatrice Boepple) returns, revealing that Freddy was conceived when she, a nun working in a mental asylum, was accidentally locked in a room with &quot;100 maniacs&quot; and raped &quot;hundreds of times&quot;. Amanda Krueger convinces Jacob to use the powers he was given by Freddy against him, which gives her the chance to subdue Freddy long enough for Alice and Jacob to escape the dream world.

Two years later, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot; followed the exploits of &quot;John Doe&quot; (Shon Greenblatt), an amnesiac teenager from Springwood, who was sent out to find Freddy&#x27;s daughter Maggie (Lisa Zane), who he needs to leave Springwood. Freddy&#x27;s goal is to create new &quot;Elm Streets&quot;, and begin a new killing spree after having killed all of the children in Springwood. Maggie, utilizing new dream techniques, uncovers Krueger&#x27;s past, which include: being taunted by schoolmates for being the &quot;son of 100 maniacs&quot;, being cruel to animals, beaten by his stepfather, the murder of his own wife when she discovers he has been killing children, and the moment when the Dream Demons arrive in his boiler room to make him the offer of eternal life. Eventually, Maggie pulls Freddy out of the dream world, and uses a pipe bomb to blow him up.

Wes Craven returned to the &quot;Nightmare&quot; series a third time with &quot;New Nightmare&quot; in 1994. This film focuses on a fictional &quot;reality&quot;, where Craven, Langenkamp, and Englund all play themselves, and where the character of Freddy Krueger is really an evil entity that has been trapped in the realm of fiction by all the movies that have been made. Since the movies have stopped, the entity, which likes being Freddy Krueger, is trying to escape into the real world. The only person in its way is Heather Langenkamp, who the entity sees as &quot;Nancy&quot; – the first person who defeated him. Craven explains to Langenkamp the only way to keep the entity contained is for her to &quot;play Nancy one last time&quot;. Langenkamp pursues &quot;Krueger&quot;, who has kidnapped her son, into the dream world as &quot;Nancy&quot;. There, she and her son trap Krueger in a furnace until he is finally destroyed.

In 2003, New Line pitted &quot;Friday the 13th&#x27;s&quot; Jason Voorhees against Freddy Krueger. The film, &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, explains that Freddy Krueger has grown weak as people in Springwood, his home, have suppressed their fear of him. Freddy, who is impersonating Pamela Voorhees, the mother of Jason Voorhees, sends Jason (Ken Kirzinger) to Springwood to cause panic and fear. Jason accomplishes this, but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues in both the dream world and Crystal Lake between the two villains. The winner is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy&#x27;s severed head, which winks and laughs.

In 2010, a remake of the original &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; was released. Here, Freddy (Jackie Earle Haley) stalks the dreams of Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara) and her friends as they discover that they all share a common link from their childhood; they were all molested by Freddy before he was murdered by their vengeful parents. Now a supernatural force in their dreams, Freddy kills off the children that alerted the parents about his transgressions. Freddy slowly works his way to Nancy, his favorite of the children, and manipulates her into going without sleep long enough that her body falls into a coma, resulting in permanent sleep and life with Freddy forever. Nancy is awakened when her friend Quentin (Kyle Gallner) injects adrenaline into her and pulls Freddy out of the dreamworld, where she and Quentin kill him and burn the remains of his body.

===Development===
The basis for the original &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; has been said to have been inspired by several newspaper articles printed in the &quot;LA Times&quot; in the 1970s on a group of Khmer refugees, who, after fleeing to America from the Khmer Rouge Genocide in Cambodia, were suffering disturbing nightmares after which they refused to sleep. Some of the men died in their sleep soon after. Medical authorities called the phenomenon &quot;Asian Death Syndrome&quot;. The condition itself afflicted only men between the ages of 19-57 and is believed to be sudden unexplained death syndrome and/or Brugada syndrome. The 1970s pop song &quot;Dream Weaver&quot; by Gary Wright sealed the story for Craven, giving him not only an artistic setting to &quot;jump off&quot; from, but a synthesizer riff from the &quot;Elm Street&quot; soundtrack as well. It has also been stated that he drew some inspiration after studying eastern religions.

Initially, Fred Krueger was intended to be a child molester, but Craven eventually decided to characterize him as a child &quot;murderer&quot; to avoid being accused of exploiting a spate of highly publicized child molestation cases that occurred in California around the time of production of the film. By Craven&#x27;s account, his own adolescent experiences led to the naming of Fred Krueger. He had been bullied at school by a child named Fred Krueger, and named his villain accordingly. The colored sweater he chose for his villain was based on the DC Comics character Plastic Man, and Craven chose to make Krueger&#x27;s sweater colors that of red and green, after reading an article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1982 that said the two most clashing colors to the human retina were this particular combination.

Robert Englund has revealed that at a time, there was a serious development toward a prequel for Freddy&#x27;s story called &quot;The First Kills&quot;, which would have been centered around two policemen chasing for the Springwood Slasher and two lawyers during the legal proceedings. Englund claims that John McNaughton was considered for directing the prequel, but these plans were forgotten after New Line Cinema was merged with Turner Broadcasting System in 1994. McNaughton came back later around the millennium shift and hoped to produce an alternative prequel story, alongside scriptwriter R.J. Tsarov, which would have been set in Hell, where McNaughton imagined Freddy to have been stuck in between his lynching and the events of the 1984 film. New Line Cinema rejected this idea due to the film &quot;Little Nicky&quot; (2000) having been partially set in Hell while also being a box-office bomb, deterring the company from producing another film set in Hell at that time.

On January 29, 2008, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes production company would be rebooting the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; franchise with a remake of the original 1984 film. To provide a freshness to the character, producer Brad Fuller explained that they were abandoning the things that made the character less scary—Freddy would not be &quot;cracking jokes&quot; as had become a staple of his character in later sequels—and focus more on trying to craft a &quot;horrifying movie&quot;. There was not agreement among the original crew as to whether it would be a good idea to remake the film. Craven expressed his displeasure, primarily because the filmmakers chose not to have him as a consultant to the film, unlike with the 2009 remake &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; where he &quot;shepherd[ed] it towards production&quot;. In contrast, Robert Englund felt it was time for &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; to be remade. Englund liked the idea of being able to &quot;exploit the dreamscape&quot; with CGI and other technologies that did not exist when Craven was making the original &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; in 1984.

===Box office===
The &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series, when compared to the other top-grossing American horror series—&quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, &quot;Saw&quot;, &quot;Scream&quot;, and &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;—and adjusting for 2023 inflation, is ranked third with $793.5 million. &quot;Halloween&quot; is the highest-grossing horror series in the United States at approximately $1.09 billion. Next in line is &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; at $908.4 million, The &quot;Scream&quot; film series is in fourth place with $779.5 million, followed by the &quot;Saw&quot; series with $688.3 million, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; with $459.7 million, and the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; film series rounding out the list with $305.2 million.

===Critical response===
===Future===
In August 2015, it was reported that Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema were developing a second remake with &quot;Orphan&quot; writer David Leslie Johnson, with Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada and Dave Neustadter producing it.

In June 2016, Brad Fuller said the remake was in development hell. Englund expressed interest in returning to the series in a cameo role. He later expressed interest in having Kevin Bacon to portray Freddy.

In October 2018, Robert Englund reprised his role as Freddy Krueger on a Halloween-themed episode of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;.

In December 2018, Leslie Johnson said the remake of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; was still in development, but New Line Cinema was more focused on &quot;The Conjuring Universe&quot;:
In September 2019, it was announced that film rights had reverted to Wes Craven&#x27;s estate. By November, the estate had begun work on future project pitches for new &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; projects; with pitches received for both feature film and a potential HBO Max series, with the intent to have Robert Englund reprise his role as Freddy Krueger.

==Television==

Beginning on October 9, 1988, &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Nightmares&quot; was an anthology series, in the vein of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, which featured different horror stories each week. The show was hosted by Freddy Krueger, with Robert Englund reprising his role from the films. Freddy played more of a background character, but occasionally showed up to influence the plot of particular episodes. The series ran for two seasons and a total of 44 episodes, ending March 10, 1990. Although most of the episodes did not feature Freddy taking a major role in the plot, the pilot episode &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot; depicts the events of Krueger&#x27;s trial, and his subsequent death at the hands of the parents of Elm Street after his acquittal. Directed by Tobe Hooper, creator of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; franchise, Freddy&#x27;s acquittal is based on the arresting officer, Lt. Tim Blocker, not reading him his Miranda rights, which is different from the original &quot;Nightmare&quot; that stated he was acquitted because someone forgot to sign a search warrant. After the town&#x27;s parents burn Freddy to death he returns to haunt Blocker in his dreams. Freddy gets his revenge when Blocker is put to sleep at the dentist&#x27;s office, and Freddy shows up and kills him.

===Literature===
====Novels====
Between 1987 and 2003, Freddy Krueger appeared in the novelization of each of the films. The first five films were adapted by St. Martin&#x27;s Press. Those adaptations follow the films closely, with minor changes to specific details that occurred in the film. &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3&quot; does not follow the respective film, instead utilizing the same plot elements to tell a different story altogether. This novel also provides a different backstory for Freddy. In 1992, Abdo &amp; Daughters Publishing Company released adaptations of their own for the first six films. Written by Bob Italia, each was under one hundred pages and followed the films&#x27; plot. The final two books, &quot;Wes Craven&#x27;s New Nightmare&quot; and &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, were published by Tor Books and Black Flame. These novels also followed the films closely, with the adaptation of &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; containing a different ending than the movie.

====Comic books====

The popularity of the film series also led to the creation of several comic book series published by companies such as Marvel Comics, Innovation Comics, Trident Comics, Avatar Press and, most recently, WildStorm Comics. Writers such as Steve Gerber, Andy Mangels, Chuck Dixon and Brian Pulido have all contributed stories to the various series. There have been crossovers with other franchises, such as &quot;Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors&quot;.

===Documentary===

On May 4, 2010, a 4-hour documentary chronicling the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; series was released. The documentary includes interviews with the cast and crew for all of the &quot;Nightmare&quot; films. In a wish to utilize individuals who contributed to the series, the makers of the documentary procured poster artist Matthew Joseph Peak to create the artwork for the release poster and DVD cover, and composer Charles Bernstein for the film&#x27;s main title music. As part of a special offering, the filmmakers gave away a limited edition poster to anyone that ordered the documentary from the official website. Those same individuals would also be entered into a drawing to win one of three 27&quot; × 40&quot; teaser posters signed by dozens of people who worked on the films and were interviewed in the documentary. Michael Gingold of &quot;Fangoria&quot; felt the filmmakers did an amazing job bringing together all of the behind-the-scenes footage, picture, never-before-seen deleted scenes, FX scenes, and other &quot;treasures&quot;. Gingold noted that even die-hard fans would find something new. Bloody Disgusting&#x27;s Ryan Daley praised the film for being educational, and looking at the legacy of both &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and New Line Cinema. Daley believed that there was no better horror documentary. Nick Hyman of &quot;Under the Radar&quot; noted that &quot;Never Sleep Again&quot;, unlike the earlier &quot;His Name Was Jason&quot; documentary, provided a more candid interview process with the people involved. Hyman pointed out that the best part of the documentary is the look at New Line&#x27;s success through the &quot;Elm Street&quot; films, and the financial struggles and deadlines that plagued the film series.

Aside from the &quot;Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy&quot; documentary, some smaller documentaries have been made; &quot;The Making of &#x27;Nightmare on Elm Street IV&quot;&#x27; (1989) and &quot;The Making of Freddy&#x27;s Dead: The Final Nightmare&quot; (1991) covered the making of part 4 and 6 respectively. MTV released another short promotional special &quot;Slash &amp; Burn: The Freddy Krueger Story&quot; in 1991. Robert Englund also narrated the documentary &quot;Freddy Speaks&quot; in 1992, both as himself and as Freddy Krueger. Heather Langenkamp released her own documentary called &quot;I Am Nancy&quot; in 2011, while Mark Patton also released a personal documentary, &quot;Scream, Queen! My Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; in 2019.

===Merchandise===
In February 2010, Funko released a Freddy Bobblehead. Also in 2010, NECA released a 10&quot; puppet of Freddy Krueger from Phillip&#x27;s death scene in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot;, a metal replica of his glove, and two action figures: Freddy before he was burned, and the other being him after the burning, including two interchangeable heads.

===Video games===

&quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; is the shared name of two unrelated video games released in 1989, both loosely based on the series. From among those films, &quot;Dream Warriors&quot; and &quot;The Dream Master&quot; were particular influences on the gameplay of each. LJN (programmed by Rare) released one title for the NES, and Monarch Software the other for the Commodore 64 and IBM PC compatibles.
* A Nightmare on Elm Street: A Nintendo Entertainment System videogame released in 1989. Up to four players control characters who jump and punch their way through Elm Street locations as they collect the bones of Freddy Krueger to place them in a furnace and end his reign of terror. Each character can withstand only four hits from opponents before losing a life. An on-screen meter slowly diminishes (more quickly when sustaining damage), representing how close a particular character is to falling asleep. Obtaining cups of coffee within the game restores characters&#x27; sleep bar. When any character&#x27;s sleep bar empties, all the players are transported to the dream world, where enemies take on new appearances and are more difficult to defeat. In the dream world, coffee cups are replaced with radios, which return the characters to the normal world and difficulty. Dream Warrior icons appear that once collected by any player, permit transformation into one of three &quot;Dream Warriors&quot;. Each warrior has a projectile attack and improved movement: ninja (throwing stars, jump kick), acrobat (javelins, somersault), and magician (fireballs, hovering). These icons appear only in the normal world, and can be used only in the dream. If a character remains asleep too long, the film&#x27;s theme song plays and a combative encounter with Freddy ensues. Upon collecting all the bones in a level, the player is automatically put in the dream world and battles Freddy, who takes on a special form similar to those presented in the films. The final level is set at Elm Street High School as players navigate to the boiler room to burn Freddy&#x27;s bones. Here one final battle with Freddy Krueger occurs. The game can utilize the NES Four Score or NES Satellite accessories to enable four-player gameplay.
* A Nightmare on Elm Street: A game produced by Monarch Software for C64/IBM-PC gaming. Developed by Westwood Associates, its role-playing elements and overhead viewpoint bear some similarity to &quot;Gauntlet&quot;. The player chooses to play as either Kincaid, Kristen Parker, Will, Nancy, or Taryn on a quest to save Joey and defeat Freddy. The player must locate keys to open doors. Weapons and items are scattered about the levels or can be purchased from vending machines. Enemies are varied, from skeletons to wheelchairs. Freddy assumes the role of &quot;boss monster&quot; and transforms into a snake, much like his appearance in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot;.

David Bergantino, video game developer, wanted to produce a &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; game called &quot;Freddy vs. Jason: Hell Unbound&quot;, but the film being stuck in development hell constantly delayed any release of a video game, and once a release date had been set for the film, there would have been insufficient time to develop the game to correspond with the film&#x27;s release date. The game would have continued on from &quot;Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday&quot; (1993) and have been its own storyline instead of being based on any screenplay. Bergantino considered Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 and later Xbox as possible platforms for the video game. The game would have allowed up to four players with Freddy or Jason as player characters, in various forms such as &quot;Hooded Jason&quot; or &quot;Snake-Freddy&quot;. The premise would have been that Freddy and Jason are permanently stuck in Hell due to their countless unforgivable sins; Death makes the offer that whoever of the two can fight their way out of Hell, against demons and others of its denizens, gaining the highest body-count, would have been allowed to leave Hell, while the loser will remain stuck there forever. As each of the slashers are stuck in their personal hells, versions of Elm Street and Camp Crystal Lake would have existed there in some form. Freddy-based levels would have been more surreal, while Freddy could have toyed with Jason&#x27;s perceptions.

<text>The Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS, originally Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America) was a Protestant denomination in the Southern and border states of the United States that existed from 1861 to 1983. That year, it merged with the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA) to form the Presbyterian Church (USA).

==History==
===Organization (1861)===

The Presbyterian Church in the United States grew out of regional and theological divisions within the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA), the first national Presbyterian denomination in the U.S., founded in 1789. In 1838, the PCUSA divided along theological lines due to the Old School–New School Controversy. The New School faction advocated revivalism and a softening of traditional Calvinism, while the Old School was opposed to the extremes of revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession, the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s doctrinal standard. Many New School Presbyterians were also supportive of moral reform movements, such as abolitionism.

As a result, after 1838 most Southern Presbyterians aligned with the Old School Presbyterian Church. The reluctance of the Old School General Assembly to rule on moral and political questions not explicitly addressed in the Bible resulted in the Northern and Southern sections of the Old School Presbyterian Church staying united longer than their New School counterparts. The latter split over slavery in 1858. New School synods and presbyteries in the South established the pro-slavery United Synod of the South.

Old School Presbyterians remained united until after the start of hostilities in the American Civil War. In May 1861, the Old School General Assembly passed the controversial Gardiner Spring Resolutions that called on Presbyterians to support the Federal Government of the United States as a religious duty. Southerners, with support from a minority of Northerners, protested that this action violated the spirituality of the church and required Southerners to commit treason against their home states in order to remain members of the church.

After the May meeting of the General Assembly, some presbyteries in the South immediately renounced the jurisdiction of the General Assembly. On August 15, a convention in Atlanta, Georgia, representing 17 presbyteries, encouraged all presbyteries who had not done so to renounce the General Assembly&#x27;s jurisdiction. It also recommended that the constitution of the church remain unchanged, with the exception of replacing the phrase &quot;Presbyterian Church in the United States of America&quot; with the name &quot;Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America&quot;. A general assembly was scheduled to meet in Augusta, Georgia, on December 4, and by that time 47 presbyteries and 10 synods had severed ties to PCUSA. The first General Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church accepted the recommendations of the convention and elected Benjamin M. Palmer its first moderator.

===Postwar years (1865–1900)===
After the Confederacy&#x27;s defeat, the church renamed itself as the &quot;Presbyterian Church in the United States&quot;. The denomination grew during its early years in part due to the absorption of a number of smaller Presbyterian groups. In 1864, the church re-united with Southern New School Presbyterians when it merged with the United Synod of the South. Between 1867 and 1874, the church welcomed the Patapsco Presbytery of Maryland, the Kentucky Synod, and the Missouri Synod after those jurisdictions withdrew from the Old School PCUSA in protest over political actions taken by that denomination. Between 1867 and 1870, the church absorbed the Alabama and Kentucky Presbyteries of the Associate Reformed Church, a denomination with roots in the Covenanter and Seceder traditions of Scottish Presbyterianism. These and other mergers added over 35,000 members and 490 local churches.

In the 1880s, the PCUS endured a prolonged battle over Darwinian evolution. James Woodrow, professor at Columbia Theological Seminary, sparked controversy when he suggested that evolutionary thought did not contradict the biblical teachings on creation. In response, the Synod of South Carolina, in which the seminary was located, prohibited the teaching of evolution in 1884. Similar actions were taken by the synods of Georgia, South Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Columbia&#x27;s board of directors was reorganized, and it voted to fire Woodrow. He refused to vacate his position and appealed to Augusta Presbytery, which exonerated him of any heresy in August 1886. This decision was appealed to the General Assembly, which after five days of debate ordered Woodrow&#x27;s removal from his professorship. Despite his removal, Woodrow continued to be considered a member in good standing of the PCUS and was elected moderator of the South Carolina Synod in 1901. Nevertheless, the overwhelming sentiment of the PCUS was that evolutionary theory was a threat to Christian orthodoxy. As a result, Southern Presbyterians would disengage from scientific developments for more than a generation.

===Later history===
After the war, the PCUS retained its &quot;Old School&quot; Presbyterian emphasis until the 20th century. The PCUS leaders began to emphasize that they needed to change in light of the changing South, which was undergoing urbanization and industrialization.

The Woman&#x27;s Auxiliary of the Presbyterian Church, U.S. was established in 1912, uniting various PCUS women&#x27;s groups into one organization.

A point of contention were talks of merger between the mainline &quot;Northern Presbyterians&quot;, the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and its successor denomination, the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. A vote for merger had come up in 1954, and despite popular support among many, the vote to merge failed. The two denominations did collaborate on a joint hymnal. The PCUS also joined the Episcopalians, United Methodists, the United Church of Christ and the UPCUSA in the Consultation on Church Union in 1962, a group begun by UPCUSA stated clerk Eugene Carson Blake. Eventually, by 1968, union churches and presbyteries were formed (that is, members of both the UPCUSA and the PCUS), and in 1970, a &quot;Plan of Union&quot; was drawn up. Union did not take place for another thirteen years.

Another important event occurred in 1965, when Rachel Henderlite became the first woman ordained in the Presbyterian Church in the United States; she was ordained by the Hanover Presbytery in Virginia.

The response to the civil rights movement in effect split the PCUS into three factions: a liberal group desiring full endorsement of the movement&#x27;s platform, a moderate faction desiring church-wide consensus before taking positive action, and a conservative/traditionalist group vigorously opposing what it believed was the meddling of the church in the civil and cultural traditions of its native region. Conservatives argued that church activity on behalf of racial desegregation and voting rights constituted a violation of the doctrine of &quot;the spirituality of the church&quot;, a principle developed by 19th-century Presbyterian theologian James Henley Thornwell. He had declared that social reform and political participation were duties or pursuits to be taken up by individuals, not church courts. The conservative group strongly defended that teaching, but the liberal critics believed the doctrine was a justification for maintaining racial segregation and preserving the social standing of historic upper-class white elites within Southern society, a fair percentage of whom were PCUS members.

Having been eventually defeated numerous times in the General Assembly by a coalition of the liberals and moderates from the 1960s onward, some PCUS conservatives, primarily from non-metropolitan parts of the Deep South, founded what today is the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) in late 1973. They cited its rationale as &quot;[a] long-developing theological liberalism which denied the deity of Jesus Christ and the inerrancy and authority of Scripture&quot; on the part of PCUS leaders. Some evangelicals, however, remained in the PCUS in order to contend for their beliefs; this group was more willing to perceive common cause with UPCUSA conservatives. By the 2000s, some churches from both lines began to depart from the post-merger denomination over similar concerns and moral disputes, namely in favor of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.

After the conservatives left the PCUS mainly for the PCA, but a minority for the EPC, it became easier for the remainder to work on union with the UPCUSA. Eventually, in 1983, the &quot;Plan of Union&quot; came up to a vote, with 53 PCUS presbyteries voting in favor of union, and 8 in opposition. On June 10, 1983, the reunion between the &quot;northern&quot; and &quot;southern&quot; Presbyterians was celebrated in Atlanta with the new denomination taking the name of the &quot;Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)&quot;.

==Beliefs and practices==
The PCUS was one of the more conservative bodies of Presbyterianism throughout most of its history, with a strong emphasis on subscription to the Westminster Confession and interest in Calvinist scholasticism, particularly as expressed in Common Sense Realism and later the Princeton Theology. In fact, as their northern counterparts in Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. began to modify Calvinism, and experiment with confessional revision, in the later part of the 19th and into the early 20th centuries, the PCUS prided itself in being the bastion of &quot;Old School&quot; Presbyterianism, stoutly resisting calls for change to accommodate liberalizing sensibilities. However, in the immediate years after World War II, many ministers and churches, especially in larger cities, began to embrace, or at least tolerate, modernist and neo-orthodox understandings of doctrine and church life.

One important product of this liberalization was ecumenism, expressed in merger talks with the &quot;northern&quot; Presbyterian Church, known as the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America after 1958 (despite the common reference as &quot;northern&quot;, the UPCUSA had congregations in all 50 states by the 20th century, with most of its southern churches the result of a 1906 merger with most of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church or the affiliation of African-American churches in the South Atlantic states after the Civil War). In 1946, with cooperation of three other denominations, it formed the United Andean Indian Mission, an agency that sent missionaries to Ecuador. Among some of the other liberalizing trends were the ordination of women in 1964, the ratification of a pro-choice position on abortion by the General Assembly, and the rejection by that assembly of the plenary verbal inspiration of the Bible, considered by conservatives as a touchstone dogma.

Beginning in 1942, in response to liberal trends in the PCUS, conservative churchmen such as L. Nelson Bell, longtime medical missionary to China and father-in-law of evangelist Billy Graham, began establishing various periodicals and renewal parachurch organizations for conservative clergy and laymen alike. In 1966, conservatives founded Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi. Eventually, in December 1973, prompted both by liberalism, and a proposed &quot;Plan of Union&quot; between the UPCUSA and the PCUS which reportedly had not included an escape clause for congregations that had no desire of being part of the planned denomination, delegates from 260 churches met in Birmingham, Alabama to form the National Presbyterian Church, which would later be renamed the Presbyterian Church in America in 1974.

Following the departure of more conservative PCUS members into the PCA, the PCUS drafted a &quot;Declaration of Faith&quot;, which paralleled the social concerns expressed in the UPCUSA&#x27;s Confession of 1967. While it was approved by the General Assembly of 1976, it failed to receive a requisite supermajority of the presbyteries (largely due to opposition states where loyalist conservatives remained), and the 1977 General Assembly instead approved it for study purposes, without binding authority. That issue became moot upon the 1983 merger, as the Confession of 1967 was retained in the new denomination&#x27;s &quot;Book of Confessions&quot;.

<text>Jon Steven Young (born October 11, 1961) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 15 seasons, most notably with the San Francisco 49ers. He was drafted by and played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Prior to his NFL career, Young was a member of the Los Angeles Express in the United States Football League (USFL) for two seasons. He played college football for the BYU Cougars, setting school and NCAA records en route to being runner-up for the 1983 Heisman Trophy.

Amidst a contract dispute with the Express, Young left the fledgling USFL midway through the 1985 season to join the Buccaneers. Two seasons of underwhelming play led Tampa Bay to trade him to the 49ers in 1987. A quarterback controversy ensued as he spent several seasons backing up starting quarterback Joe Montana, who had previously led San Francisco to four Super Bowl championships. Young became the 49ers&#x27; full-time starting quarterback in 1991. He was named the AP&#x27;s NFL Most Valuable Player in 1992 and 1994, and was the MVP of Super Bowl XXIX where he led the 49ers to a victory over the San Diego Chargers with a record six touchdown passes. During his 1994 MVP campaign, Young set a new NFL record for passer rating at 112.8. He is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Young was an extremely efficient passer, leading the league in passer rating a record six times and completion percentage and yards per attempt five times. At the time of his retirement, Young had the highest passer rating among NFL quarterbacks with at least 1,500 passing attempts (96.8). Currently, he is ranked fourteenth all time in passer rating, and is ranked fourth-highest amongst retired players, behind only Drew Brees, Tom Brady, and Tony Romo. Young&#x27;s 43 career rushing touchdowns are fourth among quarterbacks, while his 4,239 rushing yards ranks sixth all time.

==Early life==
Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Young attended Eastern Middle School, and Greenwich High School in Greenwich, Connecticut, where he played quarterback on its Cardinals football team. 

Young earned 1978 All-FCIAC West Division First Team honors in his junior year, his first year as a starter. In his senior year, Young rushed for 13 touchdowns and earned All-FCIAC West Division First Team honors, and was named to the CIAC All-State team. In the rush-first option offense run by Greenwich, he completed only 41 percent of his throws for 1,220 yards, but ran the ball 267 times for 1,928 yards. On Thanksgiving Day in November 1979, Greenwich lost to Darien High School, known for its &quot;Tidal Wave Defense&quot;, 17–0. During his senior year, Young was co-captain of the football, basketball, and baseball teams. In basketball, he averaged 15 points a game. In baseball, Young hit .384 and played center field when he was not pitching. Young was 5–1 and threw a 3–0 no-hitter against New Canaan High School.

==College career==
Young was heavily recruited by the University of North Carolina. Coach Dick Crum was enamored of Young&#x27;s running ability, and wanted him to run his option offense. Young instead chose BYU. Initially, he struggled at throwing the ball, and BYU&#x27;s coaching staff considered switching him to defensive back because of his athleticism. However, Young worked hard to improve his passing skills and eventually succeeded record-setting Jim McMahon as BYU&#x27;s starting quarterback. Young passed for 3,902 yards and 33 touchdowns in the regular season, and his 71.3% completion percentage set an NCAA single-season record. Young also added 544 yards rushing. With Young at quarterback, BYU set an NCAA record by averaging 584.2 yards of total offense per game, with 370.5 of those yards coming from his passing and rushing. The Cougars finished the year with an impressive 11–1 record; Young was named a unanimous All-American and received the Davey O&#x27;Brien National Quarterback Award, which recognizes the nation&#x27;s best collegiate quarterback each year. He also finished second in voting for the Heisman Trophy, behind Nebraska running back Mike Rozier. Young capped his college career by scoring the game-winning touchdown on a pass from the halfback in BYU&#x27;s 21–17 victory over Missouri in the 1983 Holiday Bowl.

Young finished his college career with 592 pass completions for 7,733 yards and 56 touchdowns, along with 1,048 rushing yards and 18 touchdowns. He was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Professional football==
At the time Young left college the USFL was proving a serious challenge to the established NFL, and he had a choice to be a top pick in either league.

=== Los Angeles Express ===
Young was selected by the USFL Los Angeles Express in the first round (11th overall) of the 1984 draft held that January. Express general manager Don Klosterman told Young that if he signed with the Express, his head coach would be John Hadl, a former All-Pro quarterback who had shepherded John Elway through his first year in the NFL. Klosterman also told Young that Hall of Fame coach Sid Gillman, who had been hired as a consultant, would tutor him on how to be a pro quarterback.

The regular 1984 NFL draft would not be held until May. To help influence his decision, the Express offered an all-sports record 10-year, $40 million contract. Young was convinced, and signed with the Express in March 1984. He agreed to take his payment in the form of an annuity paid out over forty years to help the fledgling team.

After missing the first six games of his rookie season while taking some college classes in order to graduate on time, Young started the final 12 games. He had a respectable year, highlighted by becoming the first pro football player ever to pass for 300 yards and rush for 100 in a single game.

Despite a roster which included such future NFL players as Jojo Townsell, Mel Gray, and Kevin Nelson, and making the Western Conference title game in Young&#x27;s first season, the Express were never able to create a sustaining fan base in Los Angeles. They often played to sparse crowds that looked even more so in the then-95,000-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

Near the end of the 1984 season, Express owner J. William Oldenburg was forced to give up control of the team after multiple reports revealed he had misrepresented his net worth. Houston Gamblers minority owner Jay Roulier was cleared to buy the team, only to be pushed out shortly before the 1985 preseason when it emerged that he too had lied about his finances. For all intents and purposes, the Express&#x27; 1985 season ended at that point. The league took over the team and cut the budget to the bare minimum. Notably, no money was allocated to replace injured players. This left the Express in a precarious position when a rash of injuries decimated the roster. Even before then, Young and the other young players concluded that the Express would not be around for the planned move to a fall schedule in 1986, even if the USFL survived. With this in mind, they played tentatively so as not to harm their NFL prospects. As a result, despite fielding essentially the same team as a year prior, the Express cratered to a 3–15 record.

Before the Express&#x27; final home game — which had been moved to Los Angeles Pierce College in the San Fernando Valley — the bus driver refused to leave unless he was paid up front, in cash. Young contributed some money, as did the team trainer, and the driver took them to the game. In the season finale at Orlando, Young had to line up at tailback because the Express had no healthy running backs left on the roster.

It was reported that Young had insured his contract and would still be paid until 2027. However, facing the prospect of both a faltering owner and an unstable league, Young had already renegotiated his 10-year deal down to 4 years, and had already collected a total of $4.8 million of the $5.8 million due in total through the final year of that deal (in 1987), working out to an annual rate of pay of $2.4 million for his first two seasons that was the highest in all of American sports. Included in that negotiation was a payment of $1.4 million for the balance of the 10-year annuity (less money paid out against it), and salaries for the remaining two years of the deal &quot;in excess of $450,000&quot; annually according the USFL Commissioner then overseeing the LA Express (which had fallen into receivership).

=== Tampa Bay Buccaneers ===
Young grew increasingly dissatisfied with the disarray surrounding the Express. Just a week before what proved to be the last USFL title game, Young gave the USFL an ultimatum – find a new owner for the Express, or allow him to buy out his contract and go to the NFL. Soon after the league decided to suspend the Express&#x27;s operations for the 1986 season, Young bought out his Express contract and signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who had made him the first pick in a supplemental draft of USFL and CFL players a year earlier.

By this time, the Buccaneers were in the midst of what would be 12 consecutive 10-loss seasons. They posted identical 2–14 records in Young&#x27;s two seasons with them, going 3–16 with him as a starter. Young threw for only 11 touchdowns with 21 interceptions while completing fewer than 55% of his passes.

=== San Francisco 49ers ===
The Buccaneers selected University of Miami quarterback Vinny Testaverde first overall in the 1987 NFL draft because Young was deemed a bust. Young was traded to the San Francisco 49ers on April 24, 1987, to serve as a backup to Joe Montana. 49ers coach Bill Walsh was impressed by Young&#x27;s natural abilities, and believed his lackluster numbers were primarily due to the lack of talent around him in Tampa Bay.

The Buccaneers received second and fourth round draft picks in the trade, which they used to draft Miami linebacker Winston Moss, and Arizona State wide receiver Bruce Hill, respectively.

==== Montana&#x27;s backup: 1987–1990 ====

Young played behind Montana for four years, but shone as a backup. Substituting for an injured Montana, early in the first quarter of a 1987 game against the Chicago Bears, Young threw four touchdown passes in a 41–0 victory. In their 1987 divisional playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings, he replaced Montana in the second half after the team fell behind 27–10. The 49ers still lost the game, but Young had a good performance, completing 12 of 17 pass attempts for 158 yards, a touchdown, and an interception while also leading San Francisco in rushing with 72 yards and a touchdown on six carries. On October 30, 1988, Young ran for a 49-yard, game-winning touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings. He started the game out with a 73-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor, after Montana went down with an injury. The play earned the 49ers a 24–21 victory and a bit of revenge on the Vikings for their previous season&#x27;s playoff loss. The win turned out to be crucial. Without it, the 49ers would have finished the season 9–7 and missed the playoffs. Two other teams in their division, the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints, had 10–6 records. Instead, the 49ers won their division, earned the #2 playoff seed, and went on to win the Super Bowl.

In 1989, Young displayed potential to become the team&#x27;s starter in the future. While Montana won the NFL MVP award and led the team to a victory in Super Bowl XXIV, Young still had a good season, completing 69% of his passes for 1,001 yards, eight touchdowns, and only three interceptions. On October 22, 1989, he posted a perfect passer rating of 158.3 when he completed 11 of 12 passes for 188 yards and three touchdown passes in a 37–20 victory over the New England Patriots.

Young rushed for a career-high 102 yards on just eight carries against the New Orleans Saints on December 23, 1990, making him only the second 49ers quarterback to rush for at least 100 yards in a single game. The 49ers lost the game 13–10.

In his four seasons as a backup, Young threw 23 touchdown passes and only six interceptions.

==== 1991 season ====
Following an injury to Montana&#x27;s elbow in the 1990 NFC Championship Game, which forced him to miss the entire 1991 season, Young got his chance to lead the 49ers, but got off to a rough start. Midway through the season, the 49ers found themselves struggling with a 4–4 record. In the ninth game of the season, after throwing a franchise-record 97-yard touchdown pass to Taylor, Young suffered a knee injury and was replaced by backup quarterback Steve Bono. After a loss in that game and the next, Bono led the 49ers to five consecutive victories, playing so well that coach George Seifert decided to keep him in the starting lineup after Young had recovered. It was not until late in the 15th game of the season, after Bono went down with an injury of his own, that Young got to play again. Young then closed out the season by throwing for 338 yards and three touchdowns and also rushing for 63 yards and another touchdown in a 52–14 win over the Chicago Bears in a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game at Candlestick Park.

Young finished the season with an NFL best 101.8 passer rating. Despite missing five full games and most of a sixth, he still threw for 2,517 yards, 17 touchdowns, and only eight interceptions. Despite Young&#x27;s strong season, the season for the team was widely regarded as a disappointment. The 49ers had slipped from a 14–2 record in the previous season to a 10–6 record in 1991. 10 wins, while usually being enough to grant a playoff spot for a team, kept the 49ers just short of the playoffs, and San Francisco ended up not playing in the postseason for the first time since 1982. It was thought by many that Young&#x27;s days as the 49ers starter were numbered due to the impending return of Montana from the injury to his right elbow, and some observers said the 49ers should trade Young and keep Montana and Bono. However, the trade never happened.

==== 1992 season: First MVP ====

By the start of the 1992 season, it appeared that Young&#x27;s starting job was in serious peril. In addition to having to compete with Bono, Montana appeared to be close to recovering from his elbow tendon surgery. San Francisco came close to trading Young to the Los Angeles Raiders, but no deal was finalized and it turned out that Montana would not recover in time to start in the opening game. Montana would not return until the final game of the 1992 season, a Monday Night home game against the Detroit Lions. Montana played the entire second half of that final game and guided the 49ers to victory.

Young ended up as San Francisco&#x27;s starting quarterback, but once again got off to a rough start. On the fifth play of the opening game at the New York Giants, he suffered a concussion and was replaced by Bono, who threw two touchdown passes while leading the 49ers to a 31–14 victory. The following week, the 49ers lost 34–31 to the Buffalo Bills, despite a career-high 449 passing yards and three touchdowns from Young, in a game that for the first time in NFL history had zero punts from either team.

Young recovered and led the 49ers on a five-game winning streak, capped off by a 56–17 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in which he passed for 399 yards and three touchdowns. After missing most of the next game (a 24–14 loss to the Cardinals) with the flu, Young led San Francisco to a victory in all of their remaining games of the season, giving the team a 14–2 record. He went on to throw for 227 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 73 yards in a 20–13 divisional playoff win over the Washington Redskins. However, the 49ers lost the NFC Championship game, 30–20, to the eventual Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys. Young threw for 313 yards, completing 71.4% of his passes while passing for a touchdown and rushing for another. However, he also threw two interceptions, but the final one came with the outcome of the game already decided.

Young finished the season with 3,465 passing yards and 537 rushing yards, along with an NFL-best 25 touchdown passes and 107.0 passer rating, earning him the NFL Most Valuable Player Award and his first selection to the Pro Bowl. Young was the first quarterback ever to record a triple-digit rating in consecutive seasons. Many credit his turnaround to the mentoring of the 49ers&#x27; new offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan, who worked with Young on combining his running skill with on-the-move passing decisions.

==== 1993 season ====
Before the start of the 1993 season, team owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. announced that he wanted Montana to resume his role as starting quarterback for the 49ers. However, a rift in the locker room had developed, with players split on whom they wanted at quarterback. In the spring of 1993, at Montana&#x27;s request, San Francisco traded Montana to the Kansas City Chiefs. Young was now the 49ers&#x27; undisputed starter, and would remain so for the rest of his career. But once again, Young had a rough start to the season. Over the first four games of 1993, Young, who was hindered by a swollen thumb on his throwing hand, threw eight interceptions, more than he had thrown during the entire 1992 season. But after his thumb healed, Young went on an incredible streak over a span of seven games, throwing 16 touchdown passes with only two interceptions and a 122.2 passer rating. By the end of the year, Young set franchise records for most passing yards (4,023), and consecutive passes thrown without an interception (189, later eclipsed by Alex Smith in 2012), while leading the NFL in touchdown passes (29) and passer rating (101.5). The team slipped to a 10–6 record, but advanced to the NFC championship game again by blowing out the New York Giants 44–3 in the Divisional Round. However, they were again defeated by the Dallas Cowboys, this time 38–21.

====1994 season: Second MVP and Super Bowl win====
After several key free agent signings (including All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders) and NFL draft selections, the 49ers looked to win their first Super Bowl since 1989. They started fast, beating the Los Angeles Raiders 44–14 on the strength of four touchdown passes from Young, one of four games during the regular season in which he had at least four. After a loss in a much-anticipated game to Joe Montana and the Kansas City Chiefs, the 49ers won their next two games before losing to the Philadelphia Eagles 40–8 at Candlestick Park, a game in which Young was eventually benched in the middle of an offensive series. Although head coach George Seifert later said he only pulled Young because he was getting manhandled by the Eagles&#x27; defense, Young had had enough of being scapegoated for 49er shortfalls and loudly (and visibly) lambasted Seifert over his decision while standing on the sideline during the game. 
But the game was considered a turning point in the season; from there, Young led the team to 10 consecutive wins, by an average of 20 points, before losing the meaningless finale against the Vikings in which Young completed his first 12 of 13 attempts before going to the sidelines. They finished an NFL best 13–3, securing home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. The 49ers had the number-one offense in the NFL, and were so dominant that Seifert often took Young out of games early if he felt that the 49ers had an insurmountable lead at the time.

After an easy 44–15 victory over the Chicago Bears in the Divisional Round, the 49ers jumped out to a 31–14 halftime lead over the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Championship Game, holding on to win 38–28. Young threw for two touchdowns, while adding 47 yards and another touchdown on the ground. As a result, he went to his first Super Bowl as a starting quarterback. The 49ers were heavy favorites to become the first team with five Super Bowl victories.

On the strength of a six-touchdown performance that surpassed the previous Super Bowl record of five, owned by the man Young replaced, Joe Montana, Young was named the MVP of Super Bowl XXIX, as the 49ers defeated the San Diego Chargers, 49–26. Young also threw for 325 yards and rushed for 49 yards, making him the first player ever to finish a Super Bowl as the game&#x27;s leader in both rushing and passing yards.

The victory capped off an incredible year for Young, who had one of the best seasons by a quarterback in NFL history. He threw for 3,969 yards, a then-franchise record 35 touchdown passes with only 10 interceptions, completed 70.3 percent of his passes – the highest completion percentage of the 1990s, third all-time, and at the time, the best completion percentage by any quarterback with more than 400 attempts (later eclipsed by Drew Brees in 2009). Additionally, Young broke Joe Montana&#x27;s single-season mark with a then-record 112.8 passer rating, and also once again demonstrated his great scrambling ability, accumulating another 289 yards and seven touchdowns on the ground. For his record-breaking season performances, Young was awarded his second AP NFL MVP award, becoming the seventh player in NFL history to win both league and Super Bowl MVP honors in the same season.

==== Later years and injuries ====
In the three years following Super Bowl XXIX, the 49ers were eliminated in the playoffs each year by Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers, twice in San Francisco. In addition to the early playoff exits, Young suffered a series of injuries that forced him to miss several games from 1995 to 1997. Young entered the 1998 season at age 37 and some began to wonder if his skills would diminish because of his history of injuries and a general decline in his game due to age. However, Young silenced all critics once again, putting up career numbers in passing yards (4,170) and passing touchdowns (36). The 49ers finally beat Favre and the Packers in the NFC Wild Card Round that year, as Young threw the winning touchdown to wide receiver Terrell Owens with three seconds remaining to win the game 30–27. In reference to Dwight Clark&#x27;s legendary catch against the Dallas Cowboys in the 1981 NFC Championship Game, Owens&#x27;s grab was called &quot;The Catch II&quot;. A week later, however, Garrison Hearst broke his ankle on the 49ers&#x27; first play from scrimmage. Without the threat of a running game, Young threw three interceptions (the last one a Hail Mary pass with under 30 seconds remaining in the game) and the 49ers were defeated by the Atlanta Falcons 20–18. Over that span of seasons from 1995 to 1998, Young led the NFL in passer rating twice (in 1996 and 1997), and led the NFL with 36 touchdown passes in 1998.

The 1999 season turned out to be Young&#x27;s last in the NFL. Young was plagued by concussions throughout his career. During a Week 3 &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Arizona Cardinals, Young was violently sacked by Cardinals cornerback Aeneas Williams on a blitz. Running back Lawrence Phillips was supposed to pick up Williams, but missed. Young was knocked out of the game with a concussion, and did not return again for the rest of the season due to symptoms of post-concussion syndrome. The concussion he suffered against the Cardinals was reportedly his second in a season that was only three weeks old, and the seventh (at least) of his career. Following the season, the 49ers told him that he would be released if he did not retire. Although Young was offered a job as the starting quarterback of the Denver Broncos (where his former offensive coordinator, Mike Shanahan, was the head coach), he retired because of his repeated concussions. In a 2013 &quot;Frontline&quot; interview, Young said that, partially based upon their own experiences, he and many retired players are increasingly concerned about repeated concussions and subconcussive hits. Young is particularly concerned about certain positions that take frequent hits, such as running backs and linemen.

===Records and legacy===

Although Young did not become the 49ers&#x27; first-string quarterback until his seventh NFL season, and he played a full season only thrice (all consecutively) during his 15-year career, Young had a significant impact on the NFL. A two-time league MVP, he completed 2,667 of 4,149 passes for 33,124 yards and 232 touchdowns, with 107 interceptions, and 43 rushing touchdowns. Young&#x27;s 96.8 career passer rating is the twelfth highest in NFL history and fourth highest among retired players, behind Tony Romo, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees. Young&#x27;s 4,239 rushing yards are the sixth most ever gained by a quarterback, behind Michael Vick, Cam Newton, Russell Wilson, Lamar Jackson, and Randall Cunningham. At the time of his retirement, Young had the highest career passer rating ever, and only trailed Cunningham in rushing yards for a quarterback. He was the NFL&#x27;s top rated passer in six different seasons and led the league in touchdown passes four times. In 20 postseason games, Young threw 20 touchdown passes with only 13 interceptions, and scored eight touchdowns on the ground. During his stint with the 49ers, Young passed for 29,907 yards, 221 touchdowns, and 86 interceptions, with a passer rating of 101.4, highest in franchise history. He was also sacked 290 times, also most in franchise history. From October 20, 1991, to October 1, 2023, Young held the franchise&#x27;s highest single game completion rate of 90%, which he set against the Detroit Lions, until it was bested by Brock Purdy&#x27;s 95.2% against the Arizona Cardinals.

In 2000, Young gave the opening prayer at the Republican National Convention.

In 2007, Young co-founded Huntsman Gay Global Capital (HGGC) with billionaire industrialist Jon M. Huntsman and former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay. After being involved in business ventures with the private equity firm, Young continued to serve as a managing director.

In 2011, Young was one of several notable BYU athletes and coaches who appeared in the school&#x27;s &quot;Real Cougar&quot; advertising campaign, which featured the individuals telling an actual cougar about being a &quot;real cougar&quot;. In one of the ads, Young poked fun at himself:
:Young: I love BYU so much I even got my law degree here.
:Cougar: (growls)
:Young: Lawyers... I know.
As of 2022, Young has been serving as chairman of the board for Integrity Marketing Group and his private equity firm, Huntsman Gay Global Capital, held a position in the partnership.

===Acting career===
Young has both performed dramatic roles and appeared as himself in a limited acting career. He appeared in one episode of &quot;Frasier&quot; and one episode of &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (cast as Lois&#x27; former high school football quarterback boyfriend, Joe Maloy).

In 1995, Young appeared as himself in the Season 6, Episode 12 episode of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;.

Young also made a guest appearance as himself in season 8 of the NBC comedy series &quot;Wings&quot; in the episode &quot;Just Call Me Angel&quot;.

Young was supposed to receive a part in the 1998 movie &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; - a role specifically written for him - but he turned it down. Instead it went to Brett Favre.

===Broadcasting career===
Young was laid off by ESPN on June 30, 2023, after being a fixture on ESPN&#x27;s NFL studio shows, including “NFL Countdown,” for more than two decades. He was part of a round of layoffs that included many notable on-air personalities.

==Philanthropy==

Young serves as a National Advisor to . This non-profit organization plans expeditions to African and South American countries to provide life skills mentoring with sustainable solutions in education, enterprise, health and simple technology.

In 1993, Young founded a charitable foundation known as the &quot;Forever Young Foundation&quot;, which serves children facing significant physical, emotional, and financial challenges by providing academic, athletic, and therapeutic opportunities otherwise unavailable to them.

Young also serves as the national spokesman for an organization founded by former Save Darfur Coalition executive director and founder, David Rubenstein. Young began his affiliation with the organization in 2009, when he became the honorary league commissioner for their charitable dodgeball tournaments held on college campuses nationwide.

While at BYU, Young was a passenger in a car crash in which the driver, a family friend named Jill Simmons, died. It is unclear if the driver had fallen asleep, or if she had died of an aneurysm, in advance of the crash.

Young married his wife, Barbara Graham, in 2000. They have two sons and two daughters. According to &quot;A Football Life&quot;, as his playing career ended before his eldest child was born, Young wrote his autobiography &quot;QB: My Life Behind the Spiral&quot; initially as a private memoir for his children. The book was published in 2016, with writer Jeff Benedict as coauthor.

Young resides in the San Francisco Bay Area.

<text>Annonay (; ) is a commune and largest city in the north of the Ardèche department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region of southeastern France. It is the most populous commune in the Ardèche department although it is not the capital which is the smaller town of Privas. Other communes in the Ardèche department are Aubenas, Guilherand-Granges, and Tournon-sur-Rhône.

==Geography==
The commune consists of the city of Annonay and the hamlets of Vissenty, Chatinais, and Boucieu. With residential development, these four entities have merged into one today. Further away is the hamlet of Toissieu.

Annonay was built over several small hills at the confluence of the rivers Cance (Canse) and Deûme (Deôme). Annonay is a crossroads of trade routes: from the Rhône Valley to the region of Saint-Étienne (east-west) and from Lyon to south of the Massif Central (north-south). It is located south of Lyon, south-west of Saint-Rambert-d&#x27;Albon, and north-west of Saint-Vallier at the foot of the mountains of Vivarais just west of the river Rhône. Access to the commune is by the D121 from Davezieux in the north-east passing through the commune and the city and continuing to Villevocance in the south-west. There is also the D578 from the city to Quintenas in the south and the D206 to Saint-Marcel-les-Annonay in the north. There are also the D371 and the D370 in the east of the commune.

The geology consists mainly of grey or light orange leucogranite and orthogneiss rich in biotite, sillimanite, and cordierite with alternating bands of felsic and mafic material. The escarpment of Annonay is surrounded by plateaux and gentle hills used for cultivating cherries, apricots, apples, pears, and other crops. A reservoir created by damming the Ternay River north-west of the town provides water for industrial and domestic use. The highest point of the town at is located near a place called &quot;Sagne Ronde&quot;; the lowest point at is the bed of the Cance near the ruins of the &quot;Mill Baru&quot;. The Montmiandon overlooking the city, rises to above sea level.

==Name==
The origin of the name of the town has numerous hypotheses. One of these suggests that &quot;Annonay&quot; comes from &#x27; meaning the domain of an &quot;Annonius&quot;, a rich Roman who lived there. Another explanation is that &quot;Annonay&quot; came from the presence of a food store of the &#x27;. In any case, the site of the city has been occupied since antiquity. Roman coins and medals were found during the digging of the Rue Malleval in 1851.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
The first written mention of Annonay dates from 403. A chronicle of archives in Vienne characterized the city as a small town &quot;built by poor unclothed workers lost in the mountains of Haut-Vivarais&quot;.

A manuscript which has now disappeared, &quot;History of Annonay&quot; by P. Bartholomew Popon stated that Evance, Bishop of Vienne, had built on the site of Liberty Square a church dedicated to Saint-Mary or Our Lady in 584.

A charter of 790 (&quot;The statutes of the Church of Vienne&quot;), confirmed in 805, extracted from the cartulary of the Church of Vienne and quoted Annonay as the seat of a rural archpriest.

In the 13th and early 14th centuries, the small town of Annonay was an important step on the road of pilgrimage to the Virgin of Puy-en-Velay. In witness to this hostelries for pilgrims, five monasteries including the Saint-Clair Convent, one Cordelier, and two priories one of which was the Chapel of Trachin.

The family &quot;de Roussillon&quot; dominated the region. One of its members, Guillaume de Roussillon, participated in the Crusades. From 1288 a charter was signed between the city and the Lord of Annonay. This granted some autonomy to the city: in particular the right to levy taxes.

In 1342 or 1347, Annonay suffered the Black Death which raged in Europe. A large part of the population was decimated. From 1365 two consuls were responsible for the city.

During the 15th century, Annonay affirmed itself as a commercial crossroads: exporting its wine, trading between the valley of the Rhône, the Dauphiné and the mountain by mule, the tannery developed using the waters of the Deume. The city, built on a rocky outcrop located between two rivers, was defended by the castle of Roussillon in the south and two fortified houses: in the north Maleton and in the west Du Peloux. A line of ramparts ringed all. The suburbs grew towards the Champ de Mars along the banks of the Cance and Deume. The relative prosperity however attracted thieves, highwaymen, and mercenaries. During the Hundred Years War the city strengthened its fortifications with watchtowers, such as the so-called Martyrs Tower. The walls were pierced by gates to control the entrance and exit to the city. There are written references to the Deume, Cance, and Champ entrances, to mention only the most important.

In 1487 the city had fourteen churches or chapels for about two thousand inhabitants. At the center of town was the parish Church of Notre Dame to which was attached a college of canons of the order of Saint-Ruf. Until the Wars of Religion clerics represented up to half of the population.

===Modern times (16th and 17th centuries)===

In 1524 Annonay was attached to the domain of the King of France in the wake of the revolt by the Constable of Bourbon: his property, which included Annonay, was confiscated. The country was then dominated by the &quot;Lévis-Ventadour&quot;, the &quot;Rohan-Soubises&quot; etc.

====Wars of Religion====
During this period Annonay had 3,500 inhabitants. The districts of Cance and Deume were neglected by the wealthy in favor of the Place Vielle (Old Square – now the Place de la Liberté or Liberty Square), Place Grenette, Rue des Forges (formerly Main Street and today Rue Franki Kramer).

Annonay adopted Protestantism before Geneva. From 1528 a Franciscan friar, &quot;Etienne Machopolis&quot; – who had heard Martin Luther preach in Saxony, spread the new ideas. In 1539 two merchants from Annonay were burned alive for spreading the ideas of Luther. It was the excesses of the clergy that pushed people into the arms of the Reformation. Moreover, in the region Protestants such as the Benay family had developed the culture of silkworms and protected the Italian artisans who came to develop the silk mills.

Annonay, when in the hands of Protestants, was taken for the first time in 1562 by the Catholic troops of Christophe of Saint-Chamond, Lord of Thorrenc and Andance. The city was retaken at the end of 1562 by the Protestants led by Jean de Saint-Romain, his own brother. Saint-Romain and his troops destroyed the Catholic places of worship in Annonay except for the Trachin Chapel which became a Protestant temple. On 10 January 1563 three thousand Catholics commanded by Saint-Chamond dislodged them from Annonay. The city was sacked in five days. The Edict of Amboise (March 1563) restored peace by giving Protestants freedom of worship in bailiwicks such as Annonay. To this misfortune was added another: plague broke out in 1564.

In 1568 the Protestants of Saint-Romain seized Annonay and slaughtered the college of Notre Dame. A few months later, in September, Catholics, under the command of Saint-Chamond, retook the city again. The troops of Saint-Romain reverted to the masters of Annonay on 17 July 1574. The houses of Cance and Bourgville districts were razed and the ramparts ruined, college and various Annonay chapels were completely destroyed except the Trachin Chapel. From 1574 the Protestant Lord Jean de Fay of Virieu was sent by Henry III to negotiate peace between Catholics and Protestants. A compromise was found in the castle of La Condamine: the Protestant lord was responsible for controlling the locations in the region which were disarmed. An edict of pacification was granted in 1577. The city then had a long period of peace but in the short term trade and industry were destroyed. The city, in ruins, had only 300 fires or about 1500 inhabitants. Religious orders were expelled. In 1583, 1584, and 1585, poor harvests caused inflation, food shortages, and famine. Plague wreaked havoc in Upper Vivarais.

With the signing of the Edict of Nantes the city regained prosperity. At the end of the 16th century thirty tanneries were located on the banks of the Deume and Cance, attracted by the quality of their waters and the prosperous farms nearby. The tanneries grew. There were 11 Tanners and 4 Dressers in 1590; there were 20 and 37 respectively in 1704.

===17th–18th centuries===
Catholicism became the new majority in the capital of Upper Vivarais due to the massive influx of foreign population. Reconstruction of the Church of Notre Dame was undertaken with a constrained budget. Meanwhile, the Trachin Chapel, the only intact religious building, became the parish church. A Protestant church was built in the district of the Place Saint-Ursula. In September 1601 Annonay received a visit by the future Saint Francis de Sales and a little later from the future Saint John Francis Regis. The reconstruction of the city was characterized by the arrival of new religious communities and the creation of educational institutions such as the Convent of Santa Maria. A new hospital, joining the medieval structures of Notre-Dame La Belle and Notre-Dame de l&#x27;Aumône was created on 16 March 1686 at the Champ-de-Mars.

In 1685 the revocation of the Edict of Nantes affected Annonay. Protestants who were at that time 50% of the population had to choose between exile, abjuration, or to continue practicing their religion in secret. The Protestants were mostly artisans, manufacturers, wine-growers, and traders. A century later a census showed that there were only 7% Protestants mostly from the upper classes.

The paper industry was started in Annonay in the 17th century with the Montgolfier brothers, papermakers originating from Auvergne, installed at Vidalon-lès-Annonay (today a hamlet in the commune of Davézieux). The Johannots, another Auvergne family, had been settled in Faya since 1634. Attracted to the water quality, the driving force of the rivers, and the abundance of raw materials (rags), they imported technological innovations from Holland: e.g. the Dutch pile.

In the maze of streets and small squares of Annonay, there was progress with the commissioning in 1726 of four public fountains fed by captive water sources.

In 1780 industrial production was booming: 25,000 cow hides and 500,000 sheep skins were processed by the tanneries. Paper mills produced 300 tons of paper. This success did not go smoothly: the employment in great numbers of the best workers by Montgolfier caused a scarcity of labor and demands for wage increases. There was a strike for two months in the Vidalon Workshop in late 1781 after a long period of tension between the employer and his employees, the first lost the best of his workforce through his intransigent attitude at a time when fights between &quot;gavots&quot; and journeymen were common.

In 1781, the term Bailiage was changed to &quot;Sénéchaussée&quot;.

On 14 December 1782, thanks to Etienne and Joseph Montgolfier, the first balloon rose above Vidalon-lès-Annonay. It consisted of a large paper bag lined with cloth placed over a fire of wet straw and wool. It remained however a private experience: the first public official flight in a hot air balloon took place on 4 June 1783 at Annonay, or precisely from the Place des Cordeliers – in front of a chosen public: the Members of State particularly of Vivarais. Several other inventions are credited to Joseph Montgolfier: the hydraulic ram, the method of manufacture of Wove paper and filter paper, called joseph paper.

Annonay developed through trade. It benefited from an improved road network (even if it was as a result of the revolt of camisards). In 1787 Annonay had 130 merchants for about 7,000 inhabitants. Among them: 11 drapers, 11 clothiers, 26 grocers, 3 goldsmiths, 26 shoe merchants, and 28 tailors. At the same time, the Catholic parish of the city was headed by a priest-archpriest, and vicars. The college of canons was composed of the prior and twelve canons. The monastery of the Poor Clares had twelve nuns and two lay sisters, the Convent of Santa Maria had thirty nuns and four lay sisters. Adding to this religious presence was the pastor of the Protestant community.

===French Revolution===
The French Revolution started down this organization. The region was characterized by a wave of dechristianization which caused a certain spirit of resistance among the Catholic and Protestant populations. The Terror made victims such as Pierre-François Dulau-Dallemand, the pastor of Saint-Julien-Vocance; Bartholomew Montblanc, Vicar at Givors hidden around Annonay, and the priests of Rouville, Bac-et-Guards, and former Jesuits. To them must be added the three Sisters of Saint-Joseph from the community of Vernosc-lès-Annonay.

The representatives of Annonay, while being very favorable to the new order, adopted a moderate attitude. This moderation was well illustrated by the personality of the lawyer Boissy d&#x27;Anglas, closely linked to the Girondins. André Joseph Abrial, a native of Annonay, became Minister of Justice and was an author of the Civil Code (&quot;Code Napoleon&quot;).

===19th century===
During the first half of the 19th century, the need for an industrial workforce for paper-making and leather at Annonay attracted population from the surrounding countryside. The number of inhabitants doubled from 5,550 in 1801 to 11,398 in 1846 (it would reach 18,445 inhabitants in 1866). The physiognomy of the city changed with the rapid development or opening of new shopping streets (Rues Sadi Carnot, Montgolfier, Boissy d&#x27;Anglas, Tournon, Melchior de Vogue). A new city hall was built in a developing area.

In 1822, the Congregation of St. Basil, a Catholic order of priests was founded in the town.

On 26 February 1848, the city workers violently showed their support for the revolutionary Parisians (during February 1848), including the stoning of houses belonging to notable people. The army maintained order.

With demographic pressure, the size of the existing infrastructure including the sole Catholic church did not allow proper welcoming of new residents to the faith. Two new churches were built: Saint-Francis and Saint-Joseph. Around the city, about a kilometer or two new town houses were built in the image of the &quot;Domain of Marc Seguin&quot; or Déomas Castle constituting a &quot;sunbelt&quot;.

The tannery rode the industrial prosperity of Annonay. High-end gloves were made in Grenoble but the best skins came from Annonay. In 1870 the Annonay tannery processed 8 million skins and employed 50% of the workers in the city. Three thousand of them were working at the time in this industry.

Improving the road network and creating the first lines of railway put an end to Annonay&#x27;s role as a commercial center for the mountainous hinterland. The latter was now in direct contact with Saint-Étienne. The east-west trade that were advantageous to Annonay were replaced by north-south trade particularly following the valley of the Rhône. From now on Annonay, although the hometown of Marc Seguin, would be connected to the railway network by a branch line.

The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 blocked exports: the stocks of the Annonay works were blocked for a time in Paris. This crisis began the decline of the tanneries in Annonay compounded by weak industrial investment. More than 2,000 employees were laid off to go and find work in other areas.

Barthélémy Baru Canson married the daughter of Étienne de Montgolfier. New processes of papermaking were established and production became specialized. The paper mill employed 1,500 people around 1875. Such activity requires a lot of water which was supplied by the Ternay reservoir from 1867. Its water was also distributed to residents through standpipes positioned in each district.

While modern community life was started with the creation of the first sports clubs such as &quot;Annonéenne&quot;, a company gym which still exists; the nascent local press reported on events such as celebrations marking the centenary of the first flight of a balloon. Annonay improved its main entrance by creating a new road connecting the PLM station to the center of town: the Boulevard of the Republic (1883–1888).

===The 20th century===
In the early 20th century, the city still retained its appearance after the Wars of religion except for the Station district. Construction works were mainly concentrated in the industrial valleys of Cance and Deume. The historic center saw the building of Annonay&#x27;s first department store &quot;Les Galeries Modernes&quot; (currently Public Service offices) and reconstruction on another site of the historic church of Notre-Dame. At this time the &quot;magic of electricity&quot; came (1910). The telephone was known and used. The national news with the laws on religious congregations and the separation of church and state was a passion in Annonay and in its surroundings. There were expulsions of monks and nuns with the &quot;Querelle des inventaires&quot; particularly active during violent protests motivated by the fear of a return to the excesses of 1793–1794.

The First World War with its refugees, its wounded, its mutilated, and its dead (552 from Annonay) put an end to the protests.

The period between the two wars was marked by the presidential visit of Alexandre Millerand in 1923 on the occasion of the inauguration of the monument in honor of Marc Seguin and by the 150th anniversary of the first flight of the balloon (1933). The appearance of the city remained the same: dirty, dark streets, few new buildings like the &quot;Vanaude&quot; house. The &quot;sunbelt&quot; of castles contrast with the city center of slums and polluting industries. On the economic front mechanical industries grew: machines for the tannery of the Mercier brothers and especially for the manufacturing of buses. The old craft business of Jean-Joseph Besset became Renault then Irisbus, who manufacture its entire range of buses and coaches for France. These entrepreneurs invented the concept of the industrial zone. The descendants of the Montgolfier brothers, B. and E. de Canson invented tracing paper and photographic paper. Weaving experiencing strong growth.

During the Second World War Annonay was the site of the last battles of 1940. On 6 June 1944 the local resistance of the Secret Army were the first to liberate their own city. These facts earned the city the Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 and a citation at the order of the nation.

When peace returned, industrial sectors developed in Annonay such as food processing and pharmaceutical production. Other industries declined following the marginalisation of the work of leather and textile after great social conflict. The face of the city changed. From 1949 near the Besset factory a new district was created from scratch on farmland. It contains large housing subdivisions, schools, sports facilities and shops. Catholics built their fourth church in the city. Urbanization moved towards Boulieu-lès-Annonay, Roiffieux, and especially Davézieux with its industrial and commercial area. In the center, renovation of the old town, reconstruction of the banks of the Deume and the hillsides of Cance are scheduled. From a city with black façades, slums, and industrial wastelands, Annonay has become a colorful city made of new or rehabilitated buildings. The Deume has been covered for more than one kilometer and a new axis conveys traffic: the Avenue de l&#x27;Europe.

The Annonay people celebrated with great pomp the centenary of the railway line (1970), Marc Seguin (1975 and 1986), and the bicentennial of the first flight of the hot air balloon (1983).

===The 21st century===
The city bore the brunt of deindustrialisation. Economic jewels disappeared causing job losses (industrial weaving, manufacture and paper production). At the same time new companies emerged bringing hope in the fields of food and cleaning equipment.

Although more discreet in a secular society religious life remains. The Catholic community created the parish of Sainte-Claire by merging the parishes of the city of Annonay, Roiffieux, Vocance, Villevocance, Vanosc, Saint-Julien-Vocance, Monestier, and the hamlet of Toissieu. The Protestant community is shared between the Evangelical Church and the United Protestant Church of France. The Muslim community built the &quot;House of the Orient&quot;, a building which includes the first mosque in Annonay.

On 8 March 2001, an ETA suspect was arrested at a local roadblock.

Associative and cultural life is rich. The people of Annonay celebrated the centennial of the opening of the new Church of Notre Dame (2012) and the establishment of the Joseph Besset factory (2013).

==Economy==
Annonay has a strong industrial tradition, originally powered by the water flowing through the deep gorges around the town. In the 19th century, it was connected to the Paris-Lyon Railway and was famed for the best paper in France. It also produced glove leather and cotton, woolen, and silk goods. A modern dam was constructed across the Ternay, an affluent of the Deûme northwest of town, which expanded the power available to local factories. By the First World War, the leather industry had become predominant, while the economy expanded to include more raw silk, flour, chemical manures, glue, gelatine, brushes, chocolates, and candles. Although the leather industry has since declined, the &quot;Tannerie d&#x27;Annonay&quot; (&quot;Annonay Tannery&quot;) continues the tradition under the &quot;Grison&quot; brand.

Irisbus (a Renault Vehicles Industries and Fiat Iveco joint venture) builds buses and is the largest single employer with around 2,000 staff with several associated businesses.

The multinational paper company Arjo Wiggins subsidiary &quot;Papeteries Canson et Montgolfier SA&quot;, which dates back to 1557 owns three of the several paper factories in the town.

Other industries in or close to the town include plastics, textiles, and pharmaceutical companies including Ciba, Aguettant and Tetra Médical.

There are a number of vineyards near the town.

The average salary in the area is 23,300 euro.

<doc id="296582" wikidata="Q1615956" url="?curid=296582" title="Hooters Air">
<text>Hooters Air was an airline headquartered in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States. Hooters Air flights were operated by Winston-Salem, North Carolina–based Pace Airlines both as ad hoc private charters, and as scheduled USDOT public charters. As such, flights operated both under Pace Airlines&#x27; IATA Code of Y5 for ad hoc charters, and under its own IATA Code of H1 for public charters.

==History==
The airline was established in 2003 and started operations on March 6, 2003. It was founded by Hooters of America restaurant owner Robert Brooks, who acquired Pace Airlines in December 2002. All flights were operated by Pace Airlines. Hooters Air was owned by Hooters of America, Inc. Brooks initially envisioned Hooters Air as an unconventional means of generating awareness for the Hooters restaurant brand; the carrier was sometimes referred to as a &quot;flying billboard&quot; for the restaurant chain.
Aside from its unorthodox neighborhood chain-restaurant tie-in, Hooters Air sought to differentiate itself from other carriers with a distinctive style of in-flight service. The carrier was marketed towards golfers in an effort to bring casual and tournament players to Myrtle Beach&#x27;s 100+ championship golf courses. Two &quot;Hooters Girls,&quot; dressed in their restaurant uniforms, were on each flight assisting the (traditionally attired) in-flight crews with hospitality duties. The company advertised nonstop flights for most routes, including slogans like &quot;Fly a mile high with us.&quot; Although Hooters Air billed itself as a low-fare carrier, rows of seats were removed from the aircraft to provide a seating pitch to all passengers, comparable to the legroom offered by many carriers&#x27; business classes; in keeping with the golf-friendly orientation of the carrier, this was called &quot;Club Class&quot; seating. Additionally, all seats were upholstered in dark blue or black leather, and all aircraft were painted in Hooters&#x27; orange and white company colors featuring the company logo, and mascot (&quot;Hootie the Owl&quot;), on the vertical stabilizer. Also, at a time when many low-cost carriers were eliminating in-flight frills in an effort to curtail expenses, Hooters Air served complimentary meals to all customers on trips lasting over one hour.

On December 8, 2005, Hooters announced that it would end service to Rockford, Illinois on January 5, 2006, as a result of the airport authority&#x27;s bringing in a competing airline (United Airlines) on its Rockford-Denver route, and providing revenue guarantees for the competitor.

All commercial services were suspended on January 9, 2006. Parent company Pace Airlines continued with charter services for another three years, ceasing operations in September 2009. On April 17, 2006, Hooters Air ceased operations, halting scheduled public charter service and refunding tickets. The company attributed this cessation of service primarily to a marked increase in fuel costs in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the autumn of 2005. Finally, on July 16, 2006, founder Robert H. Brooks passed away at age 69.

The airline is estimated to have cost Hooters of America $40 million.

<doc id="296594" wikidata="Q6600985" url="?curid=296594" title="List of U.S. states' poets laureate">
<text>Many of the states in the United States have established the post of poet laureate to which a prominent poet residing in the respective state is appointed. The responsibilities of the state poets laureate are similar to those of the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom and the equivalent Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in the United States, to make public appearances at poetry readings or literary events, and to promote awareness of poetry within their geographical region.

, 46 states and the District of Columbia have poets laureate, although a few are presently vacant. The terms can vary in length from state to state. Most states appoint a poet laureate for a one- or two-year term, fewer to several years, and some states appoint a poet to a lifetime tenure. Two states, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, previously had such posts but abolished them in 2003. Michigan had a single poet laureate from 1952 to 1959. There has never been an official State Poet Laureate in Massachusetts. While Idaho does not have a post of &quot;poet laureate&quot;, &quot;per se&quot;, the state appoints a &quot;Writer in Residence&quot;, which can be held by a novelist or poet. Alaska has similarly expanded their program to include other genres of writing, calling the program the Alaska State Writer Laureate. The state of New York has both a State Poet and a State Author.

==List of state poets laureate==
The following lists of state poets laureate below are divided by state. The name of the current poet laureate is in bold.

===Alabama===

The current poet laureate of Alabama is Ashley M. Jones. Alabama has had an official poet laureate since 1930. The Alabama Writer&#x27;s Cooperative (formerly the Alabama Writers&#x27; Conclave), described as &quot;a voluntary organization of Alabama historians, playwrights, fiction writers, poets, and newspaper writers&quot; first recommended in 1930 Samuel Minturn Peck to Governor Bibb Graves. The state legislature approved a bill to create the office on March 5, 1931. After the death of Dr. Peck, the position was not filled and was revived in 1954 due to the efforts Mary B. Ward, the president of the Alabama Writer&#x27;s Conclave, who became the state&#x27;s second laureate.

At present, a poet selected must have been an Alabama resident for at least 15 years prior to the appointment, and when commissioned by the governor, is appointed to serve on a four-year renewable basis. Before 1983, neither the organization or the state statute provided for a specific term length. The Alabama Writers&#x27; Cooperative will recommend candidate who is elected by the organization&#x27;s membership at its annual meeting. The governor subsequently commissions the candidate. A candidate for poet laureate need not be a member of the Alabama Writers&#x27; Cooperative to be nominated or selected.

===Alaska===

The position of Poet Laureate was created in 1963 (House Resolution 25). The official name was changed in 1996 to recognize and honor all genres of writing. The position is selected by the Alaska State Council on the Arts.

===Arizona===
The state of Arizona established a state Poet Laureate position in 2013, appointing Alberto Ríos as the inaugural Poet Laureate.

===Arkansas===

Charles T. Davis, appointed in 1923, was the inaugural poet laureate of Arkansas. He served in the position until his death on December 21, 1945. The position was vacant from 1946 until 1953, when Rosa Zagnoni Marinoni was appointed. Upon Marinoni’s death in 1970, Governor Winthrop Rockefeller named Ercil Brown interim laureate. When legislature reconvened, three candidates had emerged: Anna Nash Yarborough, Lily Peter, and Brown. The legislature declined to decide and instead in 1971 passed Act 90, which assigned the responsibility to the governor. Governor Dale Bumpers announced Lily Peter’s appointment on October 6, 1971. Following Peter’s death, Verna Lee Hinegardner was appointed by Governor Bill Clinton on October 4, 1991, serving until 2003. In 2003, Governor Mike Huckabee appointed Peggy Vining. Before this time, the poet laureateship had been considered a life appointment and publicity ensued but in the end the appointment stood. Peggy Vining served as Poet Laureate from 2003 until her death in 2017. The Legislature changed the term for Arkansas Poet Laureate during 2017 to 4 years.

<text>Baba Yaga is an enigmatic or ambiguous character (or one of a trio of sisters of the same name) from Slavic folklore who has two contrasting roles. In some narratives, she is described as a repulsive or ferocious-looking old woman who fries and eats children, while in others she is depicted as a nice old woman who helps the hero. She is often associated with forest wildlife. Her distinctive traits are flying around in a wooden mortar, wielding a pestle, and dwelling deep in the forest in a hut with chicken legs. 

== Etymology ==

Variations of the name &quot;Baba Yaga&quot; are found in many Slavic languages. In Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian, Romanian and Bulgarian, &quot;baba&quot; means &#x27;grandmother&#x27; or &#x27;old woman&#x27;. In contemporary Polish and Russian, &quot;&quot; / &quot;&quot; is also a pejorative synonym for &#x27;woman&#x27;, in particular one who is old, dirty, or foolish. As with other kinship terms in Slavic languages: it may be applied to various animals, natural phenomena, and objects, such as types of mushrooms, cakes, or pears. Andreas Johns speculates that &quot;Baba&quot; serves two linguistic purposes in the name: firstly, it adds a familiar component to the lesser-known word &quot;yaga&quot;, and secondly, it clarifies that the character is female.

The etymology of &quot;yaga&quot; is less clear, and there is no consensus among scholars about its meaning. In the 19th century, Alexander Afanasyev proposed the derivation of Proto-Slavic *&quot;ož&quot; and Sanskrit &quot;ahi&quot; (&#x27;serpent&#x27;). This etymology has been explored by 20th-century scholars. Related terms include the Serbian and Croatian &quot;jeza&quot; (&#x27;horror&#x27;, &#x27;shudder&#x27;, &#x27;chill&#x27;), Slovene &quot;jeza&quot; (&#x27;anger&#x27;), Old Czech &quot;jězě&quot; (&#x27;witch&#x27;, &#x27;legendary evil female being&#x27;), modern Czech &quot;jezinka&quot; (&#x27;wicked wood nymph&#x27;, &#x27;dryad&#x27;), and Polish &quot;jędza&quot; (&#x27;witch&#x27;, &#x27;evil woman&#x27;, &#x27;fury&#x27;). The term appears in Old Church Slavonic as &quot;jęza/jędza&quot; (&#x27;disease&#x27;). In other Indo-European languages, the element &quot;iaga&quot; has been linked to Lithuanian &quot;engti&quot; (&#x27;to abuse (continuously)&#x27;, &#x27;to belittle&#x27;, &#x27;to exploit&#x27;), Old English &quot;inca&quot; (&#x27;doubt&#x27;, &#x27;worry&quot;, &#x27;pain&#x27;), and Old Norse &quot;ekki&quot; (&#x27;pain&#x27;, &#x27;worry&#x27;).

== Attestations ==
Vladimir Propp wrote that depictions of Baba Yaga taken from various fairy tales do not create a coherent image.

The first clear reference to Baba Yaga (&#x27;) occurs in 1755 in Mikhail V. Lomonosov&#x27;s &#x27;. In Lomonosov&#x27;s grammar book, Baba Yaga is mentioned twice among other figures largely from Slavic tradition. The second of the two mentions occurs within a list of Slavic gods and beings next to their presumed equivalence in Roman mythology (the Slavic god Perun, for example, appears equated with the Roman god Jupiter). Baba Yaga, however, appears in a third section without an equivalence, highlighting her perceived uniqueness even in this first known attestation.

In the narratives in which Baba Yaga appears, she displays a number of distinctive attributes: a turning, chicken-legged hut; and a mortar, pestle, and/or mop or broom. Baba Yaga may ride on the broom or, most recognizably, inside a mortar, using the broom to sweep away her tracks. Russian ethnographer explains Baba Yaga&#x27;s selection of tools by numerous pagan rituals involving women. He suggests that the pestle was first to be used by Baba Yaga, because it may be used as a weapon (as such, it was used in a number of rituals) and the mortar was added later by an association.

Baba Yaga often bears the epithet &#x27; (&#x27;bony leg&#x27;), or &#x27; (&#x27;with iron teeth&#x27;) and when inside her dwelling, she may be found stretched out over the stove, reaching from one corner of the hut to another. Baba Yaga may sense and mention the &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Russian scent&#x27;) of those that visit her. Her nose may stick into the ceiling. Particular emphasis may be placed by some narrators on the repulsiveness of her nose, breasts, buttocks, or vulva.

Sometimes Baba Yaga is said to live in the Faraway or Thrice-ninth Tsardom: &quot;Beyond the thrice-nine kingdoms, in the thirtieth realm, beyond the fiery river, lives the Baba Yaga.&quot; In some tales, a trio of Baba Yagas appears as sisters, all sharing the same name. For example, in a version of &quot;The Maiden Tsar&quot; collected in the 19th century by Alexander Afanasyev, Ivan, a handsome merchant&#x27;s son, makes his way to the home of one of three Baba Yagas:

Ivan walks for some time before encountering a small hut identical to the first. This Baba Yaga makes the same comments and asks the same question as the first, and Ivan asks the same question. This second Baba Yaga does not know either and directs him to the third, but says that if she gets angry with him &quot;and wants to devour you, take three horns from her and ask her permission to blow them; blow the first one softly, the second one louder, and third still louder.&quot; Ivan thanks her and continues on his journey.

After walking for some time, Ivan eventually finds the chicken-legged hut of the youngest of the three sisters turning in an open field. This third and youngest of the Baba Yagas makes the same comment about &quot;the Russian smell&quot; before running to whet her teeth and consume Ivan. Ivan begs her to give him three horns and she does so. The first he blows softly, the second louder, and the third louder yet. This causes birds of all sorts to arrive and swarm the hut. One of the birds is the firebird, which tells him to hop on its back or Baba Yaga will eat him. He does so and the Baba Yaga rushes him and grabs the firebird by its tail. The firebird leaves with Ivan, leaving Baba Yaga behind with a fistful of firebird feathers.

In Afanasyev&#x27;s collection of tales, Baba Yaga also appears in &quot;Baba Yaga and Zamoryshek&quot;, &quot;By Command of the Prince Daniel&quot;, &quot;Vasilisa the Fair&quot;, &quot;Marya Moryevna&quot;, , &quot;The Sea Tsar and Vasilisa the Wise&quot;, and &quot;Legless Knight and Blind Knight&quot; (English titles from Magnus&#x27;s translation).

Andreas Johns describes Baba Yaga as &quot;one of the most memorable and distinctive figures in eastern European folklore&quot;, and observes that she is &quot;enigmatic&quot; and often exhibits &quot;striking ambiguity&quot;. He characterizes Baba Yaga as &quot;a many-faceted figure, capable of inspiring researchers to see her as a Cloud, Moon, Death, Winter, Snake, Bird, Pelican or Earth Goddess, totemic matriarchal ancestress, female initiator, phallic mother, or archetypal image&quot;.

== Depiction on &quot;lubki&quot; ==

Baba Yaga appears on a variety of &#x27; (singular &#x27;), wood block prints popular in late 17th and early 18th century Russia. In some instances, Baba Yaga appears astride a pig going to battle against a reptilian entity referred to as &quot;crocodile&quot;. Dmitry Rovinsky interpreted this scene as a political parody. Peter the Great persecuted Old Believers, who in turn referred to him as a crocodile. Rovinsky notices that some &#x27; feature a ship below the crocodile, interpreted as a hint to the rule of Peter the Great, while Baba Yaga dressed in a Finnish dress (&quot;chukhonka dress&quot;) is a hint to Peter the Great&#x27;s wife Catherine I, sometimes derisively referred to as the &#x27; (&#x27;Finnish woman&#x27;). A lubok that features Baba Yaga dancing with a bagpipe-playing bald man has been identified as a merrier depiction of the home life of Peter and Catherine. Some other scholars have interpreted these motifs as reflecting a concept of Baba Yaga as a shaman. The &quot;crocodile&quot; would in this case represent a monster who fights witches, and the print would be something of a &quot;cultural mélange&quot; that &quot;demonstrate[s] an interest in shamanism at the time&quot;.

According to Andreas Johns, &quot;Neither of these two interpretations significantly changes the image of Baba Yaga familiar from folktales. Either she can be seen as a literal evil witch, treated somewhat humorously in these prints, or as a figurative &#x27;witch&#x27;, an unpopular foreign empress. Both literal and figurative understandings of Baba Yaga are documented in the nineteenth century and were probably present at the time these prints were made.&quot;

== Related figures and analogues ==

, a figure closely related to Baba Yaga, occurs in the folklore of the West Slavic peoples. The two figures may originate from a common figure known during the Middle Ages or earlier; both figures are similarly ambiguous in character, but differ in appearance and the different tale types they occur in. Questions linger regarding the limited Slavic area—East Slavic nations, Slovakia, and the Czech lands—in which references to Ježibaba are recorded. , another figure related to Baba Yaga, appears in Polish folklore.

Similarities between Baba Yaga and other beings in folklore may be due to either direct relation or cultural contact between the Eastern Slavs and other surrounding peoples. In Central and Eastern Europe, these figures include the Bulgarian &quot;gorska maika&quot; (Горска майка&#x27;, &#x27;Forest Mother&#x27;, also the name of a flower); the Hungarian &quot;vasorrú bába&quot; (&#x27;Iron-nose Midwife&#x27;), the Serbian &quot;Baba Korizma&quot;, &quot;Gvozdenzuba&quot; (&#x27;Iron-tooth&#x27;), &quot;Baba Roga&quot; (used to scare children in Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia), &quot;šumska majka&quot; (&#x27;Forest Mother&#x27;), and the babice; and the Slovenian &quot;jaga baba&quot; or &quot;ježibaba&quot;, &quot;Pehta&quot; or &quot;Pehtra baba&quot; and &quot;kvatrna baba&quot; or &quot;kvatrnica&quot;. In Romanian folklore, similarities have been identified in several figures, including &quot;Muma Pădurii&quot; (&#x27;Forest Mother&#x27;) or &quot;Baba Cloanța&quot; referring to the nose as a bird&#x27;s beak. In neighboring Germanic Europe, similarities have been observed between the Alpine &quot;Perchta&quot; and &quot;Holda&quot; or &quot;Holle&quot; in the folklore of Central and Northern Germany, and the Swiss &quot;Chlungeri&quot;.

Some scholars have proposed that the concept of Baba Yaga was influenced by East Slavic contact with Finno-Ugric and Siberian peoples. The &quot;hut on chicken legs deep in the forest&quot; plainly resembles huts raised on one or several stilts using stump with roots for the stilts, in popular use by Finno-Ugric peoples and also found in forests rather than villages. The stumps with roots may be uprooted and laid in a new place as in the example exhibited in Skansen, or in ground where it was felled. Like Baba Yaga&#x27;s hut, these are normally cramped for a person, though unlike Baba Yaga&#x27;s house they do not actively walk and also do not contain a stove, being intended as storehouses and not for living. The Karelian figure &quot;Syöjätär&quot; has some aspects of Baba Yaga, but only the negative ones, while in other Karelian tales, helpful roles akin to those from Baba Yaga may be performed by a character called &quot;&quot; (&#x27;old woman&#x27;).

== In popular culture ==
* Mussorgsky&#x27;s 1874 suite &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; has a movement titled &quot;The Hut on Hen&#x27;s Legs (Baba Yaga)&quot;. The rock adaptation of this piece recorded by the English progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer includes a two-part track &quot;The Hut of Baba Yaga&quot;, interrupted by &quot;The Curse of Baba Yaga&quot; (movements 8 to 10).
* Animated segments telling the story of Baba Yaga were used in the 2014 documentary &quot;The Vanquishing of the Witch Baba Yaga&quot;, directed by American filmmaker Jessica Oreck. GennaRose Nethercott&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Thistlefoot&quot;, &quot;reimagines Baba Yaga as a Jewish woman living in an Eastern European shtetl in 1919, during a time of civil war and pogroms.&quot; 
* Sophie Anderson&#x27;s book &quot;The House With Chicken Legs&quot;, which received various accolades, features Marinka, the granddaughter of Baba Yaga. Here &quot;Yaga&quot; is not a name, but a title for the guardian who guides the dead into the afterlife, and Marinka is being trained for this role. Yagas are reimagined as kind and benevolent.
* Babaroga, which is the Serbo-Croatian term for Baba Yaga, served as an inspiration to Australian filmmaker Jennifer Kent for the creation of the Babadook, a creature from her 2014 film of the same name.

*There is a large number of Russian fairy-tale and fantasy films where Baba Yaga features as a prominent secondary character, either a villain or a helper. In a number of them Baba Yaga is among the main characters.
**1979: &quot;Baba Yaga is against!&quot;: Baba Yaga and other villains plot against the Misha, the Russian Bear mascot of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.
**2006: A Russian full feature animated film received several awards. &quot;Babka Yozhka&quot; is a diminutive for &quot;Baba Yaga&quot; and the animated film is a about a little foundling girl brought up by Baba Yaga and other fairy tale creatures.
*2025: A &quot;Doctor Who&#x27;s&quot; audio spinoff from Big Finish Productions featured a story where the Doctor goes to look for Baba Yaga and meets Vasilisa the Beautiful.

<text>Cyclosa conica is a small spider with no common name. It is an orb weaver, and it is easily recognized by the way it strings together the dead bodies of insects and other debris and hangs it near the center of its web. It hides on this string of debris, and its natural coloration makes it extremely difficult to see until it moves. One of its defenses against predators is to blend in with this debris and to feign death when disturbed. These spiders are small; the females range from 5.3 mm to 7.5 mm, and the males range from 3.6 mm to 4 mm.

The webs of these spiders are characterized by a vertical stripe running down the center. This stripe, or stabilimentum, is composed of dead prey and other debris and is used as a hiding place for the spider. The material in the stabilimentum may also serve as a decoy to mislead predators into attacking the debris, giving the spider time to escape.

At the height of his internal power and external prestige, the process of territorial expansion and creation of the modern empire-state was largely completed by 1898. 

The Ethiopian Empire was transformed under Menelik: the major signposts of modernisation were put in place, with the assistance of key ministerial advisors. Externally, Menelik led Ethiopian troops against Italian invaders in the First Italo-Ethiopian War; following a decisive victory at the Battle of Adwa, recognition of Ethiopia&#x27;s independence by external powers was expressed in terms of diplomatic representation at his court and delineation of Ethiopia&#x27;s boundaries with the adjacent kingdoms. Menelik expanded his realm to the south and east, into Oromo, Kaffa, Sidama, Wolayta and other kingdoms or peoples.

Later in his reign, Menelik established the first cabinet of ministers to help in the administration of the empire, appointing trusted and widely respected nobles and retainers to the first ministries. These ministers would remain in place long after his death, serving in their posts through the brief reign of Lij Iyasu (whom they helped depose) and into the reign of Empress Zewditu.

==Early life== 
Menelik was the son of the Shewan Amhara king, Negus Haile Melekot, and probably of the palace servant girl Ejigayehu Lemma Adyamo. He was born in Angolalla and baptized to the name Sahle Maryam. His father, at the age of 18 before inheriting the throne, impregnated Ejigayehu, then left her; and did not realize that Menelik was born. The boy enjoyed a respected position in the royal household and he received a traditional church education.

In 1855 the Emperor of Ethiopia, Tewodros II, invaded the then semi-independent kingdom of Shewa. Early in the subsequent campaigns, Haile Malakot died, and Menelik was captured and taken to the emperor&#x27;s mountain stronghold, Amba Magdela. Still, Tewodros treated the young prince well, even offering him marriage to his daughter Altash Tewodros, which Menelik accepted.

Upon Menelik&#x27;s imprisonment, his uncle, Haile Mikael, was appointed as Shum of Shewa by Emperor Tewodros with the title of Meridazmach. However, Meridazmach Haile Mikael rebelled against Tewodros, resulting in him being replaced by the non-royal Ato Bezabeh as Shum. Ato Bezabeh in turn rebelled against the emperor and proclaimed himself Negus of Shewa. Although the Shewan royals imprisoned at Magdela had been largely complacent as long as a member of their family ruled over Shewa, this usurpation by a commoner was not acceptable to them. They plotted Menelik&#x27;s escape from Magdela; with the help of Mohammed Ali and Queen Worqitu of Wollo, he escaped from Magdala on the night of 1 July 1865, abandoning his wife, and returned to Shewa. Enraged, Emperor Tewodros slaughtered 29 Oromo hostages and then had 12 Amhara notables beaten to death with bamboo rods.

==King of Shewa==

Bezabeh&#x27;s attempt to raise an army against Menelik failed; thousands of Shewans rallied to the flag of the son of Negus Haile Melekot and even Bezabeh&#x27;s own soldiers deserted him for the returning prince. Menelik entered Ankober and proclaimed himself Negus.

While Menelik reclaimed his ancestral Shewan crown, he also laid claim to the imperial throne, as a direct descendant male line of Emperor Lebna Dengel. However, he made no overt attempt to assert this claim at this time; Author Harold Marcus interprets his lack of decisive action not only to Menelik&#x27;s lack of confidence and experience but that &quot;he was emotionally incapable of helping to destroy the man who had treated him as a son.&quot; Not wishing to take part in the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia, he allowed his rival Kassai to benefit from gifts of modern weapons and supplies from the British. When Tewodros died by suicide, Menelik arranged for an official celebration of his death even though he was personally saddened by the loss. When a British diplomat asked him why he did this, he replied &quot;to satisfy the passions of the people ... as for me, I should have gone into a forest to weep over ... [his] untimely death ... I have now lost the one who educated me, and toward whom I had always cherished filial and sincere affection.&quot;

Afterward other challenges – a revolt amongst the Wollo to the north, the intrigues of his second wife Befana to replace him with her choice of ruler, military failures against the Arsi Oromo to the southeast – kept Menelik from directly confronting Kassai until after his rival had brought an Abuna from Egypt who crowned him Emperor Yohannes IV.

Menelik was cunning and strategic in building his power base. He organised extravagant three-day feasts for locals to win their favour, liberally built friendships with Muslims (such as Muhammad Ali of Wollo), and struck alliances with the French and Italians who could provide firearms and political leverage against the emperor. In 1876, an Italian expedition set out to Ethiopia led by Marchese Orazio Antinori who described Menelik as &quot;very friendly, and a fanatic for weapons, about whose mechanism he appears to be most intelligent&quot;. Another Italian wrote about Menelik, &quot;he had the curiosity of a boy; the least thing made an impression upon him ... He showed ... great intelligence and great mechanical ability&quot;. Menelik spoke with great economy and rapidity. He never became upset, Chiarini adds, &quot;listening calmly, judiciously [and] with good sense ... He is fatalistic and a good soldier, he loves weapons above all else&quot;. The visitors also confirmed that he was popular with his subjects, and made himself available to them. Menelik had political and military acumen and made key engagements that would later prove essential as he expanded his empire.

==Succession==
On 10 March 1889, Emperor Yohannes IV was killed in a war with the Mahdist State during the Battle of Gallabat (Metemma). With his dying breath, Yohannes declared his natural son, Dejazemach Mengesha Yohannes, to be his heir. On 25 March, upon hearing of the death of Yohannes, Menelik immediately proclaimed himself emperor.

Menelik argued that while the family of Yohannes claimed descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba through females of the dynasty, his claim was based on uninterrupted direct male lineage which made the claims of the House of Shewa equal to those of the elder Gondar line of the dynasty. Menelik, and later his daughter Zewditu, would be the last Ethiopian monarchs who could claim uninterrupted direct male descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (both Lij Iyasu and Emperor Haile Selassie were in the female line, Iyasu through his mother Shewarega Menelik, and Haile Selassie through his paternal grandmother, Tenagnework Sahle Selassie).

In the end, Menelik was able to obtain the allegiance of a large majority of the Ethiopian nobility. On 3 November 1889, Menelik was consecrated and crowned emperor before a glittering crowd of dignitaries and clergy by Abuna Mattewos, Bishop of Shewa, at the Church of Mary on Mount Entoto. The newly consecrated and crowned Emperor Menelik II quickly toured the north in force. He received the submission of the local officials in Lasta, Yejju, Gojjam, Wollo, and Begemder.

==Conquest of neighboring states and the defeat of the Italians==

===Conquests===


Menelik is argued to be the founder of modern Ethiopia. Before Menelik&#x27;s colonial conquests, Ethiopia and the Adal Sultanate had been devastated by numerous wars, the most recent of which was fought in the 16th century. In the intervening period, military tactics had not changed much. In the 16th century, the Portuguese Bermudes documented depopulation and widespread atrocities against civilians and combatants (including torture, mass killings, and large-scale slavery) during several successive Gadaa conquests led by Aba Gedas of territories located north of Genale river (Bali, Amhara, Gafat, Damot, Adal. Warfare in the region essentially involved acquiring cattle and slaves, winning additional territories, gaining control over trade routes, carrying out ritual requirements, or securing trophies to prove masculinity.
Menelik&#x27;s clemency to Ras Mengesha Yohannes, whom he made hereditary prince of his native Tigray, was ill-repaid by a long series of revolts. In 1898, Menelik crushed a rebellion by Ras Mengesha Yohannes (who died in 1906). After this, Menelik directed his efforts to the consolidation of his authority, and to a degree, to the opening up of his country to outside influences. The League of Nations in 1920 reported that after the invasion of Menelik&#x27;s forces into non-Abyssinian lands of Somalis, Harari, Oromo, Sidama, Shanqella, etc., the inhabitants were enslaved and heavily taxed by the Gabbar system leading to depopulation.

Menelik brought together many of the northern territories through political consensus. The exception was Gojjam, which offered tribute to the Shewan Kingdom following its defeat at the Battle of Embabo. Most of the western and central territories like Jimma, Welega Province and Chebo surrendered to Menelik&#x27;s invading forces with no resistance. Native armed soldiers of Ras Gobana Dacche, Ras Mikael Ali, Habtegyorgis Dinegde, Balcha Aba Nefso were allied to Menelik&#x27;s Shewan army which campaigned to the south to incorporate more territories.

Beginning in the 1870s, Menelik set off from the central province of Shewa to reunify &#x27;the lands and people of the South, East, and West into an empire. This period of expansions has been referred to by some as the &#x27;Agar Maqnat&#x27; - roughly translating to some type of &#x27;Cultivation&#x27; of land. The people incorporated by Menelik through conquest were the southerners – Oromo, Sidama, Gurage, Wolayta and other groups. Historian Raymond Jonas describes the conquest of the Emirate of Harar by Menelik as &quot;brutal&quot;.

In territories incorporated peacefully like Jimma, Leka, and Wolega the former order was preserved and there was no interference in their self-government; in areas incorporated after war, the appointed new rulers did not violate the peoples&#x27; religious beliefs and they treated them lawfully and justly. However, in the territories incorporated by military conquest, Menelik&#x27;s army carried out atrocities against civilians and combatants including torture, mass killings, and large scale slavery. Large scale atrocities were also committed against the Dizi people and the people of the Kaficho Kingdom. Some estimates that the number of people killed as a result of the conquest from war, famine and atrocities go into the millions. Based on convergent subjugation approaches, cooperation between Menelik and Belgian king Leopold II were attempted more than once.

===Foundation of Addis Ababa===

For a period, Ethiopia lacked a permanent capital; instead, the royal encampment served as a roving capital. For a time Menelik&#x27;s camp was on Mount Entoto, but in 1886, while Menelik was campaigning in Harar, Empress Taytu Betul camped at a hot spring to the south of Mount Entoto. She decided to build a house there and from 1887 this was her permanent base, which she named Addis Ababa (new flower). Menelik&#x27;s generals were all allocated land nearby to build their own houses, and in 1889 work began on a new royal palace. The city grew rapidly, and by 1910 the city had around 70,000 permanent inhabitants, with up to 50,000 more on a temporary basis. Only in 1917, after Menelik&#x27;s death, was the city reached by the railway from Djibouti.

=== The Great Famine (1888–1892) ===
During Menelik&#x27;s reign, the great famine of 1888 to 1892, which was the worst famine in the region&#x27;s history, killed a third of the total population which was then estimated at 12 million. The famine was caused by rinderpest, an infectious viral cattle disease which wiped out most of the national livestock, killing over 90% of the cattle. The native cattle population had no prior exposure and were unable to fight off the disease.

===Wuchale Treaty===
On 2 May 1889, while claiming the throne against Ras Mengesha Yohannes, the natural son of Emperor Yohannes IV, Menelik concluded a treaty with Italy at Wuchale (Uccialli in Italian) in Wollo province. On the signing of the treaty, Menelik said &quot;The territories north of the Merab Milesh (i.e. Eritrea) do not belong to Abyssinia nor are under my rule. I am the Emperor of Abyssinia. The land referred to as Eritrea is not peopled by Abyssinians – they are Adals, Bejaa, and Tigres. Abyssinia will defend his territories but will not fight for foreign lands, which Eritrea is to my knowledge.&quot; Under the treaty, Ethiopia and Italy agreed to define the boundary between Eritrea and Ethiopia. For example, both Ethiopia and Italy agreed that Arafali, Halai, Segeneiti, and Asmara were villages within the Italian border. Also, the Italians agreed not to harass Ethiopian traders and to allow safe passage for Ethiopian goods, particularly military weapons. The treaty also guaranteed that the Ethiopian government would have ownership of the Monastery of Debre Bizen but would not use it for military purposes.

However, there were two versions of the treaty, one in Italian and another in Amharic. Unbeknownst to Menelik the Italian version gave Italy more power than the two had agreed to. The Italians believed they had tricked Menelik into giving allegiance to Italy. To their surprise, upon learning about the alteration, Menelik rejected the treaty. The Italians attempted to bribe him with two million rounds of ammunition but he refused. Then the Italians approached Ras Mengesha of Tigray in an attempt to create a civil war, however, Ras Mengesha, understanding that Ethiopia&#x27;s independence was at stake, refused to be a puppet for the Italians. The Italians, therefore, prepared to attack Ethiopia with an army led by Oreste Baratieri. Subsequently, the Italians declared war and launched an invasion of Ethiopia.

===Italo-Ethiopian War===

Menelik&#x27;s disagreement with Article 17 of the treaty led to the Battle of Adwa. Before the Italians could launch the invasion, Eritreans rebelled in an attempt to push the Italians out of Eritrea and prevent their invasion of Ethiopia. The rebellion was unsuccessful. However, some Eritreans managed to make their way to the Ethiopian camp and jointly fought the Italians at Adwa.

On 17 September 1895, Menelik ordered all of the Ethiopian nobility to call out their banners and raise their feudal hosts, stating: &quot;An enemy has come across the sea. He has broken through our frontiers to destroy our fatherland and our faith. I allowed him to seize my possessions and I entered upon lengthy negotiations with him in hopes of obtaining justice without bloodshed. But the enemy refuses to listen. He undermines our territories and our people like a mole. Enough! With the help of God, I will defend the inheritance of my forefathers and drive back the invader by force of arms. Let every man who has sufficient strength accompany me. And he who has not, let him pray for us&quot;. Menelik&#x27;s opponent, General Oreste Baratieri, underestimated the size of the Ethiopian force, predicting that Menelik could only field 30,000 men.

Despite the dismissive Italian claim that Ethiopia was a barbaric African nation whose men were no match for white troops, the Ethiopians were better armed, being equipped with thousands of modern rifles and Hotchkiss guns together with ammunition and shells which were superior to the Italian rifles and artillery. Menelik had ensured that his infantry and artillerymen were properly trained in their use, giving the Ethiopians a crucial advantage as the Hotchkiss artillery could fire more rapidly than the Italian artillery. In 1887 a British diplomat, Gerald Portal, wrote after seeing the Ethiopian feudal hosts parade before him, the Ethiopians were &quot;...redeemed by the possession of unbounded courage, by a disregard of death, and by a national pride, which leads them to look down on every human being who has not had the good fortune to be born an Abyssinian [Ethiopian]&quot;. 

The emperor personally led his army to attack an Italian force led by Major Toselli on 7 December 1895 at Boota Hill. The Ethiopians attacked a force of 350 Eritrean irregulars on the left flank, who collapsed under the Ethiopian assault, causing Toselli to send two companies of Italian infantry who halted the Ethiopian advance. Just as Toselli was rejoicing in his apparent victory, the main Ethiopian assault came down on his right flank, causing Toselli to order a retreat. The emperor&#x27;s best general, Ras Makonnen, had occupied the road leading back to Eritrea, and launched a surprise attack, which routed the Italians. The Battle of Amba Alagi ended with an Italian force of 2,150 men losing 1,000 men and 20 officers killed.

Ras Makonnen followed up that victory by defeating General Arimondi and forcing the Italians to retreat to the fort at Mekele. Ras Makonnen laid siege to the fort, and on the morning of 7 January 1896, the defenders of the fort spotted a huge red tent among the besiegers, showing that the emperor had arrived. On 8 January 1896, the emperor&#x27;s elite Shoan infantry captured the fort&#x27;s well, and then beat off desperate Italian attempts to retake the well. On 19 January 1896, the fort&#x27;s commander, Major Galliano, whose men were dying of dehydration, raised the white flag of surrender. Major Galliano and his men were allowed to march out, surrender their arms, and go free. Menelik stated he allowed the Italians to go free &quot;to give proof of my Christian faith,&quot; saying his quarrel was with the Italian government of Prime Minister Francesco Crispi that was trying to conquer his nation, not the ordinary Italian soldiers who been conscripted against their will to fight in the war. Menelik&#x27;s magnanimity to the defenders of Fort Mekele may have been an act of psychological warfare. Menelik knew from talking to French and Russian diplomats that the war and Crispi himself were unpopular in Italy, and one of the main points of Crispi&#x27;s propaganda was allegations of atrocities against Italian POWs. From Menelik&#x27;s viewpoint allowing the Italian POWs to go free and unharmed was the best way of rebutting this propaganda and undermining public support for Crispi.    

Crispi sent another 15,000 men to the Horn of Africa and ordered the main Italian commander, General Oreste Baratieri, to finish off the &quot;barbarians&quot;. As Baratieri dithered, Menelik was forced to pull back on 17 February 1896 as his huge host was running out of food. After Crispi sent an insulting telegram accusing Baratieri of cowardice, on 28 February 1896 the Italians decided to seek battle with Menelik. On 1 March 1896, the two armies met at Adwa. The Ethiopians came out victorious.

With victory at Adwa and the Italian colonial army destroyed, Eritrea was Menelik&#x27;s for the taking but no order to occupy was given. It seemed that Menelik was wiser than the Europeans had given him credit for. Realising that the Italians would bring all their force to bear on his country if he attacked, he instead sought to restore the peace that had been broken by the Italians and their treaty manipulation seven years before. In signing the treaty, Menelik again proved his adeptness at politics as he promised each nation something for what they gave and made sure each would benefit his country and not another nation. Subsequently, the Treaty of Addis Ababa was reached between the two nations. Italy was forced to recognise the absolute independence of Ethiopia, as described in Article 3 of the treaty.

==Developments during Menelik&#x27;s reign==
===Foreign policy===

Following Menelik&#x27;s victory in the First Italo-Ethiopian War, the European powers moved rapidly to adjust relations with the Ethiopian Empire. Delegations from the United Kingdom and France—whose colonial possessions lay next to Ethiopia—soon arrived in the Ethiopian capital to negotiate their own treaties with this newly proven power. Quickly taking advantage of the Italian defeat, French influence increased markedly and France became one of the most influential European powers in Menelik&#x27;s court. In December 1896, a French diplomatic mission in Addis Ababa arrived and on 20 March 1897 signed a treaty that was described as &quot;&quot;véritable traité d&#x27;alliance&quot;. In turn, the increase in French influence in Ethiopia led to fears in London that the French would gain control of the Blue Nile and would be able to &quot;lever&quot; the British out of Egypt. 

On the eve of the Battle of Adwa, two Sudanese envoys from the &quot;Mahdiyya&quot; state arrived at Menelik&#x27;s camp in Adwa to discuss concentrated action against the Italians. In July 1896 an Ethiopian envoy was present at Abdallahi ibn Muhammad&#x27;s court in Omdurman. The British, fearing that Menelik would support the Mahdist revolt, sent a diplomatic mission to Ethiopia and on 14 May 1897 signed the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897. Menelik assured the British that he would not support the Mahdists and declared them as the enemy of his country in exchange for cession of the northeastern part of the Haud region, a traditional Somali grazing area, to Ethiopia. In December 1897, Ras Makonnen led an expedition against the Mahdists to seize the gold producing region of Benishangul-Gumuz.

===Introducing new technology===

Menelik was fascinated by modernity, and like Tewodros II before him, he had a keen ambition to introduce Western technological and administrative advances into Ethiopia. Following the rush by the major powers to establish diplomatic relations following the Ethiopian victory at Adwa, more and more Westerners began to travel to Ethiopia looking for trade, farming, hunting, and mineral exploration concessions. Menelik founded the first modern bank in Ethiopia, the Bank of Abyssinia, introduced the first modern postal system, signed the agreement and initiated work that established the Addis Ababa –Djibouti railway with the French, introduced electricity to Addis Ababa, as well as the telephone, telegraph, the motor car, and modern plumbing. He attempted unsuccessfully to introduce coinage to replace the Maria Theresa thaler.

In 1894, Menelik granted a concession for the building of a railway to his capital from the French port of Djibouti but, alarmed by a claim made by France in 1902 to control of the line in Ethiopian territory, he ordered a stop for four years on the extension of the railway beyond Dire Dawa. In 1906 when France, the United Kingdom, and Italy agreed on the subject, granting control to a joint venture corporation, Menelik officially reaffirmed his full sovereign rights over the whole of his empire.

According to one persistent tale, Menelik heard about the modern method of executing criminals using electric chairs during the 1890s and ordered 3 for his kingdom. When the chairs arrived, Menelik learned they would not work, as Ethiopia did not yet have an electric power industry. Rather than waste his investment, Menelik used one of the chairs as his throne, sending another to his second (Lique Mekwas) or Abate Ba-Yalew. Recent research, however, has cast significant doubt on this story and suggested it was invented by a Canadian journalist during the 1930s.

==Personal life and death==
The British journalist Augustus B. Wylde wrote after meeting Menelik: &quot;I had found him a man of great kindness, a remarkably shrewd and clever man and very well informed on most things except on England and her resources; his information on our country evidently having been obtained from persons entirely unfriendly to us; and who did not want Englishmen to have any diplomatic or commercial transactions whatever with Abyssinia [Ethiopia]&quot;. 

After meeting him, Count Gleichen wrote: &quot;Menelik&#x27;s manners are pleasant and dignified; he is courteous and kindly, and at the same time simple in manner, giving one the impression of a man who wishes to get at the root of a matter at once, without wasting time in compliments and beating about the bush, so often the characteristics of Oriental potentates...He also aims at being a popular sovereign, accessible to his people at all hours, and ready to listen to their complaints. In this, he appears to be quite successful, for one and all of his subjects seem to bear for him a real affection.&quot;

===Wives===

Menelik married three times but he did not have a single legitimate child with any of his wives. However, he is reputed to have fathered several children with women who were not his wives, and he recognized three of those children as being his progeny.

In 1864, Menelik married Woizero Altash Tewodros, whom he divorced in 1865; the marriage produced no children. Altash Tewodros was a daughter of Emperor Tewodros II. She and Menelik were married during the time that Menelik was held captive by Tewodros. The marriage ended when Menelik escaped captivity, abandoning her. She was subsequently remarried to Dejazmatch Bariaw Paulos of Adwa.

In 1865, the same year he divorced his first wife, Menelik married the much older noblewoman &quot;Woizero&quot; Bafena Wolde Michael. This marriage was also childless, and they were married for seventeen years before being divorced in 1882. Menelik was very fond of his wife, but she apparently did not have a sincere affection for him. Woizero Befana had several children from previous marriages and was more interested in securing their welfare than in the welfare of her present husband. For many years, she was widely suspected of being secretly in touch with Emperor Yohannes IV in her ambition to replace her husband on the throne of Shewa with one of her sons from a previous marriage. Finally, she was implicated in a plot to overthrow Menelik when he was King of Shewa. With the failure of her plot, Woizero Befana was separated from Menelik, but Menelik apparently was still deeply attached to her. An attempt at reconciliation failed, but when his relatives and courtiers suggested new young wives to the king, he would sadly say &quot;You ask me to look at these women with the same eyes that once gazed upon Befana?&quot;, paying tribute both to his ex-wife&#x27;s beauty and his own continuous attachment to her.

Finally, Menelik divorced his treasonous wife in 1882, and in 1883, he married Taytu Betul. Menelik&#x27;s new wife had been married four times previously, and he became her fifth husband. They were married in a full communion church service and the marriage was thus fully canonical and indissoluble, which had not been the case with either of Menelik&#x27;s previous wives. The marriage, which proved childless, would last until his death. Taytu Betul would become empress consort upon her husband&#x27;s succession, and would become the most powerful consort of an Ethiopian monarch since Empress Mentewab. She enjoyed considerable influence on Menelik and his court until the end, something which was aided by her own family background. Empress Taytu Betul was a noblewoman of imperial blood and a member of one of the leading families of the regions of Semien, Yejju in modern Wollo, and Begemder. Her paternal uncle, Dejazmatch Wube Haile Maryam of Semien, had been the ruler of Tigray and much of northern Ethiopia. She and her uncle Ras Wube were two of the most powerful people among descendants of Ras Gugsa Mursa, a ruler of Oromo descent from the house of was Sheik of Wollo. Emperor Yohannes was able to broaden his power base in northern Ethiopia through Taytu&#x27;s family connections in Begemider, Semien and Yejju; she also served him as his close adviser, and went to the Battle of Adwa with 5,000 troops of her own. From 1906, for all intents and purposes, Taytu Betul ruled in Menelik&#x27;s stead during his infirmity. Menelik and Taytu Betul personally owned 70,000 slaves. Abba Jifar II is also said to have had more than 10,000 slaves and allowed his armies to enslave the captives during a battle with all his neighboring clans. This practice was common between various tribes and clans of Ethiopia for thousands of years.

Taytu arranged political marriages between her Yejju and Semien relatives and key Shewan aristocrates like Ras Woldegyorgis Aboye, who was Governor of Kaffa, Ras Mekonen who was governor of Harar, and Menelik&#x27;s eldest daughter Zewditu Menelik who became Nigeste Negestat of the empire after the overthrow of Lij Iyasu. Taytu&#x27;s step daughter, Zewditu, was married to her nephew Ras Gugsa Welle who administered Begemider up to the 1930s.

===Natural children===

Previous to his marriage to Taytu Betul, Menelik fathered several natural children. Among them, he chose to recognise three specific children (two daughters and one son) as being his progeny. These were:
#A daughter, Woizero Shoaregga Menelik, born 1867. She would marry twice and become the mother of:
#*A son, Abeto Wossen Seged Wodajo, born of the first marriage; never considered for the succession due to dwarfism
#*A daughter, Woizero Zenebework Mikael, who was married at age twelve and died in childbirth one year later
#*A son, the purported Emperor Iyasu V. He nominally succeeded upon Menelik&#x27;s death in 1913, but was never crowned; he was deposed in 1916 by powerful nobles.
#A daughter, Woizero (later Empress) Zewditu Menelik, born 1876, died 1930. She married four times and had some children, but none of them survived to adulthood. She was proclaimed Empress in her own right in 1916, but was a figurehead, with ruling power in the hands of regent Ras Tafari Makonnen, who succeeded her in 1930 as Emperor Haile Selassie.
#A son, Abeto Asfa Wossen Menelik, born 1873. He died unwed and childless when he was about fifteen years of age.

Menelik&#x27;s only recognised son, Abeto Asfa Wossen Menelik, died unwed and childless when he was about fifteen years of age, leaving him with only two daughters. The elder daughter, Woizero Shoaregga, was first married to Dejazmatch Wodajo Gobena, the son of Ras Gobena Dachi. They had a son, Abeto Wossen Seged Wodajo, but this grandson of Menelik was eliminated from the succession due to dwarfism. In 1892, twenty-five-year-old Woizero Shoaregga was married for a second time to forty-two-year-old Ras Mikael of Wollo. They had two children, namely a daughter, Woizero Zenebework Mikael, who would be married at the age of twelve to the much older Ras Bezabih Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, and would die in childbirth a year later; and a son, Lij Iyasu, who would nominally succeed as emperor after Menelik&#x27;s death in 1913, but would never be crowned, and would be deposed by powerful nobles in favour of Menelik&#x27;s younger daughter Zewditu in 1916.

Menelik&#x27;s younger daughter, Zewditu Menelik, had a long and chequered life. She was married four times, and eventually became empress in her own right, the first woman to hold that position in Ethiopia since the Queen of Sheba. She was only ten years old when Menelik got her married to Ras Araya Selassie Yohannes, the fifteen-year-old son of Emperor Yohannes IV, in 1886. In May 1888, Ras Araya Selassie died and Zewditu became a widow at age twelve. She was married two more times for brief periods to Gwangul Zegeye and Wube Atnaf Seged before marrying Gugsa Welle in 1900. Gugsa Welle was the nephew of Empress Taytu Betul, Menelik&#x27;s third wife. Zewditu had some children, but none of them survived to adulthood. Menelik died in 1913, and his grandson Iyasu claimed the throne on principle of seniority. However, it was suspected that Iyasu was a secret convert to Islam, which was the religion of his paternal ancestors, and having a Muslim on the throne would have grave implications for Ethiopia in future generations. Therefore, Iyasu was never crowned; he was deposed by nobles in 1916, in favour of his aunt, Zewditu. However, Zewditu (aged 40 at that time) had no surviving children (all her children had died young) and the nobles did not want her husband and his family to exercise power and eventually occupy the throne. Therefore, Zewditu&#x27;s cousin Ras Tafari Makonnen was named both heir to the throne and regent of the empire. Zewditu had ceremonial duties to perform and wielded powers of arbitration and moral influence, but ruling power was vested in the hands of regent Ras Tafari Makonnen, who succeeded her as Emperor Haile Selassie in 1930.

Apart from the three recognised natural children, Menelik was rumoured to be the father of some other children also. These include &quot;Ras&quot; Birru Wolde Gabriel and &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Kebede Tessema. The latter, in turn, was later rumoured to be the natural grandfather of Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam, the communist leader of the Derg, who eventually deposed the monarchy and assumed power in Ethiopia from 1977 to 1991.

===Illness, death and succession===

On 27 October 1909, Menelik suffered a massive stroke and his &quot;mind and spirit died&quot;. After that, Menelik was no longer able to reign, and the office was taken over by Empress Taytu, as de facto ruler, until Ras Bitwaddad Tesemma was publicly appointed regent. However, he died within a year, and a council of regency – from which the empress was excluded – was formed in March 1910.

In the early morning hours of 12 December 1913, Menelik died. He was buried quickly without announcement or ceremony at the Se&#x27;el Bet Kidane Meheret Church, on the grounds of the Imperial Palace. In 1916, Menelik was reburied in the specially built church at Ba&#x27;eta Le Mariam Monastery in Addis Ababa.

After the death of Menelik, the council of regency continued to rule Ethiopia. Lij Iyasu was never crowned Emperor of Ethiopia, and eventually, Empress Zewditu succeeded Menelik on 27 September 1916.

==Legacy==

The Adwa Victory Day is celebrated in March annually, and it would also inspire Pan-African movements around the globe. 

Despite being generally considered the founder of modern Ethiopia, Menelik&#x27;s legacy also garnered controversies due to the atrocities committed by his army against civilians and combatants during the annexation of territories into his empire, which are considered by many historians as constituting genocide. According to Awol Allo:
A desire to share in the glamor Menelik enjoyed after his victory over Italy may explain an improbable Serb legend, recounted by English anthropologist Mary E. Durham, portraying Menelik and the Serb king of Montenegro as kinsmen, based on little more than the similarity between the Ethiopian honorific &quot;Negus&quot; and the name of the Herzegovinian village, Njegushi, from which the Montenegrin royal family originated:When these Herzegovinese migrated to Montenegro, a large body of them went yet farther afield and settled in the mountains of Abyssinia, among them a branch of the family of Petrovich of Njegushi, from which is directly descended Menelik, who preserves the title of &quot;Negus&quot; and is a distant cousin of Prince Nikola of Montenegro, and to this large admixture of Slav blood the Abyssinians owe their fine stature and their high standard of civilisation, as compared with the neighbouring African tribes. Menelik is featured as the leader of the Ethiopian civilization in the &quot;New Frontier&quot; season pass of the 4X video game &quot;Civilization VI&quot;.

<text>Ram Swarup (Hindi: राम स्वरूप; – ), born Ram Swarup Agarwal, was an Indian author and one of the most important thought leaders of the Hindu revivalist movement.

== Life ==

Ram Swarup was born in 1920 to a banker father in Sonipat, now a part of the state of Haryana in the Garg gotra of the merchant Agrawal caste. He graduated with a degree in economics from Delhi University in 1941. He started the Changer&#x27;s Club in 1944, members of which included Lakshmi Chand Jain, Raj Krishna, Girilal Jain and Sita Ram Goel. In 1948–49, he worked for Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s disciple Mira Behn (Madeleine Slade).

Swarup wrote a book on the Communist Party that was published under an assumed name. In 1949, he founded the Society for the Defence of Freedom in Asia. The Society published books, reviewed in the West, that criticised both the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet-mouthpiece &quot;Izvestia&quot; as well as &quot;Pravda&quot;, another mouthpiece for that same foreign power&#x27;s Communist Party. The Society for the Defence of Freedom in Asia ceased operations in 1955. His early book &quot;Gandhism and Communism&quot; from around this time had some influence among American policymakers and members of Congress. Swarup also wrote for mainstream Indian weeklies and dailies, like the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Times of India&quot;, &quot;Indian Express&quot;, &quot;Observer of Business and Politics&quot;, &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; and &quot;Hinduism Today&quot;.

In 1982, Swarup founded the Hindutva publishing house Voice of India, which has published works by Harsh Narain, A. K. Chatterjee, K.S. Lal, Koenraad Elst, Rajendra Singh, Sant R.S. Nirala and Shrikant Talageri, among others.

== Views ==
=== Hinduism ===

Ram Swarup upheld the polytheistic interpretation of the Vedas by rejecting the concept of one God, and states that, &quot;only some form of polytheism alone can do justice to this variety and richness.&quot;

Swarup was influenced by Sri Aurobindo, whom he held to be the greatest exponent of the Vedic vision in our times.

Ram Swarup was &quot;most responsible for reviving and re-popularizing&quot; the Hindu &#x27;critique&#x27; of Christian missionary practices in the 1980s, according to Chad Bauman. He insisted that monotheistic religions like Christianity &quot;nurtured among their adherents a lack of respect for other religions&quot;. In the 1980s, he and Goel were involved in a &quot;vigorous debate&quot; with the Christian Ashram movement represented by Bede Griffiths. Swarup has been named one of the most important thought leaders of the Hindu revivalist movement.

=== European paganism ===

Swarup also had an interest in European Neopaganism, and corresponded with Prudence Jones (chairperson of Pagan Federation) and the Pagan author Guðrún Kristín Magnúsdóttir. Under the influence of Ram Swarup, other Hindu revivalists also took an interest in European paganism.

Christopher Gérard (editor of &quot;Antaios&quot;, Society for Polytheistic Studies) said: &quot;Ram Swarup was the perfect link between Hindu Renaissance and renascent Paganism in the West and elsewhere.&quot;

Swarup has also advocated a &quot;Pagan renaissance&quot; in Europe, saying He argued that the European Pagans &quot;should compile a directory of Pagan temples destroyed, Pagan groves and sacred spots desecrated. European Pagans should also revive some of these sites as their places of pilgrimage.&quot;

<text>Georgetown College is a private Christian liberal arts college in Georgetown, Kentucky. Chartered in 1829, Georgetown was the first Baptist college west of the Appalachian Mountains.

The college offers over 40 undergraduate degrees and a Master of Arts in education. It offers degrees in areas of visual and performing arts, math and sciences, humanities, language and culture, business, medicine and healthcare, and others.

Georgetown College is associated with five Rhodes Scholars and its alumni have included 38 Fulbright Scholars since 1989.

==History==
In 1829, the Kentucky General Assembly chartered the Kentucky Baptist Education Society with the purpose of establishing a Baptist college in the state. 24 trustees under the leadership of Silas Noel selected the town of Georgetown as the site for the new school. Georgetown College&#x27;s early years were defined by perseverance in the face of hardships. The first president hired by the college in 1829, William D. Staughton, died before assuming his duties. The second president, Rev. Joel Smith Bacon, stayed two years (1830–1832), fighting court cases to release funding for the college before leaving out of frustration. The third president, Benjamin Farnsworth, endured a power struggle with the Campbellites and resigned in 1837.

In 1838, Rev. Rockwood Giddings became the fourth president of the college. During his short tenure, Giddings began construction on Recitation Hall, the school&#x27;s first permanent building, and made many other advances that put the college on sound footing. Giddings died of exhaustion after a year in office and was replaced by Rev. Howard Malcolm in 1840.

Malcolm oversaw the completion of the construction of the building, now known as Giddings Hall. He also expanded the educational offerings beyond the classics and encouraged the founding of literary societies and the Georgetown Female Academy. He resigned in 1849 when his anti-slavery vote at Kentucky&#x27;s third constitutional convention resulted in much criticism from slavery proponents and a threat on his life.

The college experienced steady growth until the Civil War, when a clear divide established between students and faculty. Partisan differences at the start of the war became so hostile, the college was forced to shut down until 1863. By 1867, enrollment had grown to seventy-six students, and, that same year, one of the earliest female seminaries was founded at the college. Basil Manly Jr. was president of Georgetown College from 1871 to 1879.

The college saw steady growth for the next century but experienced a major boom following World War II and the GI Bill, and, by 1958, enrollment had jumped to 1,397 students. Georgetown continued its growth into the 1960s and 1970s, with several new academic buildings and dormitories constructed on campus to accommodate the rise in enrollment.

The college is associated with five Rhodes Scholars and, since 1989, its alumni have included 38 Fulbright Scholars. The college also has an honors program and a partnership with Regent&#x27;s Park College, Oxford. 

As the student population grew in the late 20th century, the administration sought ways to diversify the campus and protect academic freedom. In 2005, Georgetown College and the Kentucky Baptist Convention reached an agreement on a separation plan, due to the college&#x27;s desire to elect non-Baptist members to the board of trustees. In 2013, the Kentucky Baptist Convention officially ended its partnership with the college.

In 2014, the college became one of only 18 schools nationwide to earn the highest rating for protecting free speech on campus.

==Academics==

Georgetown College offers Bachelor of Arts degrees, Bachelor of Science degrees, and several dual-program degrees in 38 undergraduate majors. The college also offers a Master of Arts degree in education.

The college has a 14:1 student to faculty ratio and most classes have 17 or fewer students.

Georgetown College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award baccalaureate and master&#x27;s degrees.

===Admissions===
In 2023, the college accepted 71.7% of applicants, with those admitted having an average 3.57 GPA and an average of 1121 SAT score or an average 21 ACT score. High school GPA is considered important by the college and, of students responding, 86% found that the admissions process made them feel the school cared about them and 86% found that the admissions process evaluated them not just as a set of numbers. 

===Rankings===
Georgetown College was ranked #156-201 in National Liberal Arts Colleges in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s 2022-23 Best Colleges ranking.

==Student organizations==
Georgetown College has 46 student clubs and organizations. The college offers a chapel and several Christian and other religious groups for students. Its social organizations cover a wide range of interests, including government, recreation, community service, activism, the arts, and academics.

===Student life===
Georgetown College has four national fraternities (Kappa Alpha Psi, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Kappa Tau, and Pi Kappa Alpha) and five national sororities (Alpha Gamma Delta, Kappa Delta, Phi Mu, Sigma Kappa and Zeta Phi Beta) on campus. It also has an independent brotherhood known as the President&#x27;s House Association, which was formed in 1964 as an alternative to the traditional fraternity system. An Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council are also part of Greek life at Georgetown College.

Government-minded students can join the College Democrats, College Republicans, United Nations Georgetown, and the Student Government Association.

Recreation and activity oriented groups include the Georgetown Activities Council, intramurals, Georgetown College Equestrian Team, Georgetown College Film Club, Outdoor High Adventure Club, Social Plug, and the Georgetown College Disc Golf Club.

Activist groups include the Georgetown Sustainability Initiative, Campus Spectrum, Habitat for Humanity, Student Abolitionist Movement, and the American Red Cross Club.

Students interested in the arts can participate in the Dance Marathon, George-Tones, Gospel Choir, Lyric Theatre Society, Maskrafters/Alpha Psi Omega, MTNA piano club, Praise Dance Ministry, and the Step Team.

Religious organizations include Common Ground and Campus Outreach.

Academic groups include Alpha Lambda Delta, American Chemical Society Club, Biology Club, Brokmeyer Society (philosophy), Delta Omicron, Georgetown College Athletic Training Students, Kentucky Education Association, Math/Physics/Computer Science Club, Nat&#x27;l Association for Music Education, Psi Chi/Psi Alpha Omega, Sigma Tau Delta (English honorary, Eta Alpha chapter, est. 1925), Sociology Club, Student Women and Gender Society, Students of National Association for Teachers of Singing, and the Academic Team.

Other student organizations include Ambassadors of Diversity, Pre-Health Association, SHAC, SHMAC, Tiger Squad, Commuter Club, and the Real Food Coalition.

===Maskrafters===
The Georgetown College Maskrafter theater group is the oldest collegiate theater company in Kentucky and offers traditional theater, an emphasis on creating original work, and new initiatives in digital motion picture art. As of 2007, the Maskrafters had produced a feature-length movie entitled &quot;Surviving Guthrie&quot;, and had put on the musical &quot;She Loves Me&quot;. Recent plays include &quot;Proof&quot;, &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. The Maskrafters are primarily students at Georgetown, and are guided by staff.

===Media===
A student-run newspaper, called &quot;The Georgetonian&quot;, publishes multiple issues per semester. A student-run radio station, WRVG, is housed on campus in the Cralle Student Center.

===Traditions===
Songfest is an evening of skits written by, starring, and produced by Greek and independent groups on campus. Skits are centered on the Homecoming theme, and also incorporate singing, dancing, and acting. Groups engage in competitions to win awards.

Chapel Day and Men&#x27;s Bid Day takes place each fall. Chapel Day is a sorority event letting the active members know which pledges have accepted their bid to join the sorority. The pledges dress in their new sorority&#x27;s colors and run through the doors of the chapel into the waiting arms of their sisters. The fraternities&#x27; version of Chapel Day occurs the following week. Referred to as Men&#x27;s Bid Day, it operates in a similar fashion. Even independent students, faculty, staff, family, and sometimes pets brave the cold to enjoy the excitement of this special campus tradition.

Homecoming is an annual tradition, highlighted by Songfest and a football game. Every year, alumni head back to Georgetown&#x27;s campus. On Saturday morning they have brunch, listen to live music, and visit with fellow alumni, professors and current students. A Homecoming King and Queen, elected by the student body, are crowned during halftime of the football game.

Belle of the Blue is Georgetown&#x27;s small-scale version of Miss America. It is an annual scholarship pageant that any freshman through junior woman can participate in. Each residence hall, including the male dormitories, nominates a woman to compete as their representative in the February event. On pageant night, the women are judged based on scholarship, interview, talent, poise and appearance. A &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; title is awarded, as well as an overall scholarship to Georgetown College.

Midnight Brunch – The Caf, each semester, selects one night during finals week to open at midnight. Students listen to music that blares and games are played, and the professors serve students platefuls of comfort food to help fuel their late-night study sessions.

Grubfest happens each September. Students join the annual battle to see which team can complete the most challenges. In a matter of hours, the Quad, a lush, green open area for socializing and studying, is turned into a slimy, muddy arena covered with food products. At the end of Grubfest, the two dirtiest and most creative participants are crowned king and queen of the year&#x27;s festivities.

Opening Convocation is held in the chapel in the early fall and is a campus-wide assembly intended to create a sense of academic community and common purpose as the academic year begins.

Hanging of the Green is held each December, and students, faculty, and staff gather together in the chapel on the first Monday night of the month for a worship service including an advent wreath lit by faculty and staff, an upperclassman offering the service&#x27;s message, and a Christmas tree trimmed on stage with ornaments representing various organizations on campus. At the end, the attendees sing &quot;Silent Night&quot;.

Commencement, or the graduation ceremony, takes place every May on Giddings Lawn. Seniors troop through the doors of Giddings Hall and fan out onto the front lawn, where commencement proceeds.

==Athletics==
The Georgetown athletic teams are called the Tigers. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Mid-South Conference (MSC) since the 1995–96 academic year. The Tigers previously competed in the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (KIAC; now currently known as the River States Conference (RSC) since the 2016–17 school year) from 1916–17 to 1994–95.

Georgetown competes in 22 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball; and co-ed sports include archery and cheerleading. Former sports included women&#x27;s acrobatics &amp; tumbling. Club sports include bass fishing and dance.

===Attempt to move to NCAA Division II===
On April 28, 2012, the college officially announced that after a year-long study, it had decided to transfer its athletics program to NCAA Division II. It was presumed they would join the newly formed Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC). However, on July 24, 2012, the college announced that its application to join the NCAA was denied. The membership committee had notified them on July 12 that &quot;it felt that Georgetown College was not ready to enter the process at this time.&quot; As of 2021, Georgetown hasn&#x27;t yet re-applied to transition into NCAA Division II.

<text>Thomas Carew (pronounced as &quot;Carey&quot;) (1595 – 22 March 1640) was an English poet, among the &#x27;Cavalier&#x27; group of Caroline poets.

==Biography==
He was the son of Sir Matthew Carew, master in chancery, and his wife Alice, daughter of Sir John Rivers, Lord Mayor of the City of London and widow of Ingpen. The poet was probably the third of the eleven children of his parents, and was born in West Wickham in Kent, in the early part of 1595; he was thirteen years old in June 1608, when he matriculated at Merton College, Oxford. He took his degree of B.A. early in 1611 and proceeded to study at the Middle Temple. 
Two years later his father complained to Sir Dudley Carleton that he was not doing well. 
He was therefore sent to Italy as a member of Sir Dudley&#x27;s household and, when the ambassador returned from Venice, he seems to have kept Thomas Carew with him, for he was working as secretary to Carleton, at the Hague, early in 1616. 
However, he was dismissed in the autumn of that year for levity and slander; he had great difficulty in finding another job. 
In August 1618 his father died and Carew entered the service of Edward Herbert, Baron Herbert of Cherbury, in whose train he travelled to France in March 1619, and it is believed that he remained with Herbert until his return to England, at the close of his diplomatic missions, in April 1624. 
Carew &quot;followed the court before he was of it,&quot; not receiving the definite commitment of the Chamber until 1628.

According to a probably apocryphal story, while Carew held this office he displayed his tact and presence of mind by stumbling and extinguishing the candle he was holding to light Charles I into the queen&#x27;s chamber, because he saw that Lord St Albans had his arm round her majesty&#x27;s neck. 
The king suspected nothing, and the queen heaped favours on the poet. Probably in 1630 Carew was made &quot;server&quot; or taster-in-ordinary to the king. 
To this period may be attributed his close friendships with Sir John Suckling, Ben Jonson and Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon; the latter described Carew as &quot;a person of pleasant and facetious wit.&quot; 
John Donne, whose celebrity as a court-preacher lasted until his death in 1631, exercised a powerful influence over the genius of Carew. In February 1633 a masque by the latter, &quot;Coelum Britanicum&quot;, was acted in the Banqueting House at Whitehall, and was printed in 1634.

The close of Carew&#x27;s life is absolutely obscure. It was long supposed that he died in 1639, and this has been thought to be confirmed by the fact that the first edition of his &quot;Poems&quot;, published in 1640, seems to have a posthumous character but Clarendon tells us that &quot;after fifty years of life spent with less severity and exactness than it ought to have been, he died with the greatest remorse for that licence&quot;. If Carew was more than fifty years of age, he must have died during or after 1645, and in fact there were final additions made to his &quot;Poems&quot; in the third edition of 1651. Izaak Walton tells us that Carew in his last illness, being afflicted with the horrors, sent in great haste to &quot;the ever-memorable&quot; John Hales (1584–1656); Hales &quot;told him he should have his prayers, but would by no means give him then either the sacrament or absolution.&quot;

==Assessment==
Carew&#x27;s poems are sensuous lyrics. 
They open to us, in his own phrase, &quot;a mine of rich and pregnant fancy.&quot; 
His metrical style was influenced by Jonson and his imagery by Donne, for whom he had an almost servile admiration. 
Carew had a lucidity and directness of lyrical utterance unknown to Donne. 
It is perhaps his greatest distinction that he is the earliest of the Cavalier song-writers by profession, of whom John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, was a later example, poets who turned the disreputable incidents of an idle court-life into poetry which was often of the rarest delicacy and the purest melody and colour. 
The longest of Carew&#x27;s poems, &quot;A Rapture,&quot; would be more widely appreciated if the rich flow of its imagination were restrained by greater reticence of taste. 
A testimonial to his posterity is that he was analyzed by 19th century critics such as Charles Neaves, who even two centuries later found Carew on the sensuous border of propriety.

==Critical reception==
Carew has long been recognized as a notable figure in English literary history. His earliest critics – chiefly other poets – evidently knew his work from the many manuscripts that circulated. Among many others, two of the most celebrated writers of the age, Sir John Suckling and William Davenant, paid tribute to Carew, playfully admiring his poetic craftsmanship. Carew&#x27;s reputation, however, experienced a slow but steady decline during the second half of the seventeenth century. Despite some interest in Carew in subsequent years, not until the twentieth century did critics offer a reexamination of Carew&#x27;s place in English literary history. 
F. R. Leavis wrote in 1936: &quot;Carew, it seems to me, has claims to more distinction than he is commonly accorded; more than he is accorded by the bracket that, in common acceptance, links him with Lovelace and Suckling.&quot; 
More recently, Carew&#x27;s place among the Cavalier Poets has been examined, as have his poetic affinities with Ben Jonson and John Donne; &quot;A Rapture&quot; has been scrutinized as both biography and fantasy; the funerary poetry has been studied as a subgenre; evidence of Carew&#x27;s views concerning political hierarchy has been found in his occasional verse; and love and courtship have been probed as themes in the &quot;Celia&quot; poems. 
By the end of the twentieth century, Carew has been recognized as an important poet representative of his time and a master lyricist. 
According to Edmund Gosse, &quot;Carew&#x27;s poems, at their best, are brilliant lyrics of the purely sensuous order.&quot;

American author and naturalist Henry David Thoreau used Thomas Carew&#x27;s poem &quot;The Pretensions of Poverty&quot; as a &quot;complemental verse&quot; to conclude the &quot;Economy&quot; chapter in his 1854 book &quot;Walden&quot;.

==Major poetry==
&quot;Poems. By Thomas Carew, Esquire&quot; is a collection of lyrics, songs, pastorals, poetic dialogues, elegies, addresses, and occasional poems. Most of the pieces are fairly short—the longest, &quot;A Rapture,&quot; is 166 lines, and well over half are under 50 lines. The subjects are various: a number of poems treat love, lovemaking, and feminine beauty. Several of the poems, including &quot;An Elegie upon the death of the Deane of Pauls, Dr. John Donne&quot; are memorial tributes; others, notably &quot;To Saxham,&quot; celebrate country-house life; and a few record such events as the successful production of a play (&quot;To my worthy Friend, M. D’Avenant, upon his Excellent Play, The Iust Italian&quot;) or the marriage of friends (&quot;On the Marriage of T. K. and C. C. the Morning Stormie&quot;).

Many of the songs and love poems are addressed to the still-unidentified &quot;Celia,&quot; a woman who was evidently Carew&#x27;s lover for years. The poems to Celia treat the urgency of courtship, making much of the &quot;carpe diem&quot; theme. Others commend Celia through simile, conceit, and cliché. The physical pleasures of love are likewise celebrated: &quot;A Rapture&quot; graphically documents a sexual encounter through analogy, euphemism, and paradox, while &quot;Loves Courtship&quot; responds to the early passing of virginity. A number of Carew&#x27;s poems are concerned with the nature of poetry itself. His elegy on John Donne has been praised as both a masterpiece of criticism and a remarkably perceptive analysis of the metaphysical qualities of Donne&#x27;s literary work. English poet and playwright Ben Jonson is the subject of another piece of critical verse, &quot;To Ben. Johnson, Upon Occasion of His Ode of Defiance Annext to His Play of The New Inne.&quot; 
This poem, like the elegy on Donne, is concerned with both the style and substance of the author&#x27;s literary works as well as with personal qualities of the author himself. Among Carew&#x27;s occasional, public verse are his addresses to ladies of fashion, commendations of the nobility, and laments for the passing of friends or public figures, such as Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden.

<text>War children are those born to a local parent and a parent belonging to a foreign military force (usually an occupying force, but also military personnel stationed at military bases on foreign soil). Having a child by a member of a belligerent force, throughout history and across cultures, is often considered a grave betrayal of social values. Commonly, the native parent (usually a woman) is disowned by family, friends, and society at large. The term &quot;war child&quot; is most commonly used for children born during World War II and its aftermath, particularly in relation to children born to fathers in German occupying forces in northern Europe. In Norway, there were also &quot;Lebensborn&quot; children. The discrimination suffered by the local parent and child in the postwar period did not take into account widespread rapes by occupying forces, or the relationships women had to form in order to survive the war years.

==Discrimination==
Children with a parent who was part of an occupying force, or whose parent(s) collaborated with enemy forces, are innocent of any war crimes committed by parents. Yet these children have often been condemned by descent from the enemy and discriminated against in their society. They also suffer from association with a parent whose war crimes are prosecuted in the postwar years. As such children grew to adolescence and adulthood, many harbored feelings of guilt and shame.

An example are the children born during and after World War II whose fathers were military personnel in regions occupied by Nazi Germany. These children claim they lived with their identity in an inner exile until the 1980s, when some of them officially acknowledged their status. In 1987, Bente Blehr refused anonymity; an interview with her was published in &quot;Born Guilty&quot;, a collection of 12 interviews with persons whose parent(s) had been associated with German forces in occupied Norway. The first autobiography by the child of a German occupying soldier and Norwegian mother was &quot;The Boy from Gimle&quot; (1993) by Eystein Eggen; he dedicated his book to all such children. It was published in Norway.

During and in the aftermath of war, women who have voluntary relationships with military personnel of an occupying force have historically been censured by their own society. Women who became pregnant from such unions would often take measures to conceal the father&#x27;s status.

They commonly chose among the following:
*Arrange a marriage with a local man, who would take responsibility for the child
*Claim the father was unknown, dead, or had left, and bring up the child as a single mother
*Acknowledge the relationship; bring up the child as a single mother
*Acknowledge the relationship; accept welfare from the occupying force (see the German Lebensborn)
*Place the child in an orphanage or give the child up for adoption
*Emigrate to the occupying country and claim that identity
*Have an abortion

After the war, it was common for both mother and child to suffer repercussions from the local population. Such repercussions were widespread throughout Europe. While some women and children suffered torture and deportation, most acts against them fell into one or several of the following categories:

*Name calling: &quot;German whore&quot; and &quot;German kid&quot; were common labels
*Isolation or harassment from the local community and at schools
*Loss of work
*Shaving the heads of the mothers (frequently done in the immediate aftermath of the war) in order to publicly identify and shame them
*Temporary placement in confinement or internment camps

While repercussions were most widespread immediately after the war, sentiments against the women and their children lingered into the 1950s, 60s, and beyond.

== War children of World War II ==
Estimates of the number of war children fathered by German soldiers during World War II are difficult to gauge. Mothers tended to hide such pregnancies for fear of revenge and reprisal by family members. Lower estimates range in the hundreds of thousands, while upper estimates are much increased, into the millions.

=== Lebensborn program ===

&quot;Lebensborn&quot; was one of several programs initiated by the Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler to try to secure the racial heredity of the Third Reich. The program mainly served as a welfare institution for parents and children deemed racially valuable, initially, those of SS men. As German forces occupied nations in northern Europe, the organization expanded its program to provide care to suitable women and children, particularly in Norway, where the women were judged suitably Aryan.

In Norway a local Lebensborn office, &quot;Abteilung Lebensborn&quot;, was established in 1941 to support children of German soldiers and their Norwegian mothers, pursuant to German law (Hitlers &quot;Verordnung,&quot; 28 July 1942). The organization ran several homes where pregnant women could give birth. Facilities also served as permanent homes for eligible women until the end of the war. Additionally, the organization paid child support on behalf of the father, and covered other expenses, including medical bills, dental treatment and transportation.

In total, between 9 and 15 Lebensborn homes were established. Of the estimated 10,000–12,000 children born to Norwegian mothers and German fathers during the war, 8,000 were registered by Abteilung Lebensborn. In 4,000 of these cases, the father is known. The women were encouraged to give the children up for adoption, and many were transferred to Germany, where they were adopted or raised in orphanages.

During and after the war, the Norwegians commonly referred to these children as &quot;tyskerunger&quot;, translating as &quot;German-kids&quot; or &quot;Kraut kids&quot;, a derogatory term. As a result of later recognition of their post-war mistreatment, the more diplomatic term &quot;krigsbarn&quot; (war-children) came into use and is now the generally accepted form.

==== Post-war years ====
As the war ended, the children and their mothers were made outcasts by many among the general populace in formerly occupied countries, as societies grieved and resented the losses of the war, and actively rejected everything associated with Germany. The children and their mothers were often isolated socially, and many children were bullied by other children, and sometimes by adults, due to their origin.

For instance, immediately after the peace, 14,000 women were arrested in Norway on suspicion of &quot;collaboration&quot; or association with the enemy; 5,000 were, without any judiciary process, placed in forced labor camps for a year and a half. Their heads were shaved, and they were beaten and raped. In an interview for the Swedish newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;, war children claim that, while living at an orphanage in Bergen, they were forced as children to parade on the streets so the local population could whip them and spit at them.

In a survey conducted by the Norwegian Ministry of Social Affairs in 1945, the local government in one third of the counties expressed an unfavorable view of the war children. The same year the Ministry of Social Affairs briefly explored the possibility of reuniting the children and their mothers with surviving fathers in post-war Germany, but decided against this.

Five hundred children who were still cared for in Lebensborn facilities at the end of the war had to leave as the homes were closed down. Some children were left to state custody, during a time when such care was marked by strict rules, insufficient education, and abuse. Approximately 20 children ended up in a mental institution in 1946, due to lack of space in other institutions and unsuccessful adoption attempts. Some remained there past their eighteenth birthdays.

Due to the political attitudes prevailing after the end of the war, the Norwegian government made proposals to forcibly deport 8000 children and their mothers to Germany, but there were concerns that the deportees would have no means of livelihood there. Another option was to send them to Sweden. Australia was also considered after the Swedish government declined to accept these people; the Norwegian government later shelved such proposals.

==== Financial and legal issues ====
In 1950, diplomatic relations improved so that the Norwegian government was able to collect child support from identified fathers of war children who were living in West Germany and Austria. As of 1953 such payments were made. Child support from fathers living in East Germany was kept in locked accounts until diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1975.

Some of the war children have tried to obtain official recognition for past mistreatment. Supporters claim the discrimination against them equated to an attempt at genocide. In December 1999, 122 war children filed a claim in the Norwegian courts for the failure of the state to protect them as Norwegian citizens. The case was to test the boundaries of the law; seven persons signed the claim. The courts have ruled such suits as void due to the statute of limitations.

The law of Norway allows citizens who have experienced neglect or mistreatment by failure of the state to apply for &quot;simple compensation&quot; (an arrangement that is not subject to the statute of limitations). In July 2004 the government expanded this compensation program to include war children who had experienced lesser difficulties. The basic compensation rate is set to 20,000 NOK (€2,500 / $3,000) for what Norwegian government terms &quot;mobbing&quot; (bullying). Those who can document other abuse can receive up to 200,000 NOK (€25,000 / $30,000).

On 8 March 2007, 158 war children were to have their case heard at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. They demanded reparations of between 500,000 SEK (≈ 431,272 NOK) and 2,000,000 SEK (≈ 1,725,088 NOK) each for systematic abuse. The Norwegian government contested the claim that the children were abused with the consent of the government. In 2008 their case before the European Court of Human Rights was dismissed, but they were each offered a £8,000 token from the Norwegian government.

==== Medical experimentation ====
In conjunction with the 1999 claim by the war children, a motion was filed in September 2000 alleging that 10 war children were subject to experiments with LSD approved by the Norwegian government and financed by the CIA, the American intelligence agency.

In the postwar years, medical staff in several European countries, and the United States, conducted clinical trials or experimental treatment involving LSD, most of them at some point between 1950 and 1970. In Norway, trials involved volunteer patients under a protocol after traditional medical treatments had proved unsuccessful.

==== Acknowledgment and apology ====
Since the mid-80s, the fate of the war children has become well known in Norway. The government of Norway has acknowledged its neglect of them. The Prime Minister of Norway apologized publicly in his New Year&#x27;s Eve speech in 2000. As adults, the 150 former Lebensborn Children are suing for reparations and damages from the Norwegian government for failing to protect them and discriminating against them.

The most famous of Norway&#x27;s war children is Anni-Frid Lyngstad, the former ABBA singer.

=== Norway ===
German forces invaded Norway in 1940 and occupied the country until 1945. At the end of the war, the German forces stood at 372,000. It is estimated that between 10,000 and 12,000 children were born to Norwegian mothers with German partners during the occupation. As Nazi ideology considered Norwegians to be pure Aryans, German authorities did not prohibit soldiers from pursuing relationships with Norwegian women. Their Lebensborn organization encouraged it.

After the war these women especially, but also their children, were mistreated in Norway.

=== Denmark ===
German forces occupied Denmark between 1940 and 1945. German soldiers were encouraged to fraternize with Danish women, who were also considered pure Aryan. The government has estimated between 6,000 and 8,000 children were born to Danish mothers with German partners during or just after the occupation. The women were nicknamed &quot;German Girls&quot;, used in a pejorative sense. The Danish government has documented 5,579 such children.

In 1999 the Danish government allowed this group access to parenthood archives. They exempted these descendants from the country&#x27;s normal secrecy period of 80 years for such records.

=== France ===
German soldiers were forbidden from having relationships with French women by the Nazi regime at the beginning of the Occupation. Due to difficulties of enforcement, the military later tolerated fraternization. This was an intermediate situation between the encouragement of similar relationships in Denmark and Norway, and strict prohibition in Eastern Europe. The different regulations were based on Nazi racial ideology as to which populations they considered racially pure enough as to be desirable for children born to their men.

The number of war children born to French women in France by German soldier fathers in the years 1941–49, is estimated to be 75,000 to 200,000.
After the expulsion of German troops from France, those women who were known to have had relationships with German soldiers, were arrested, &quot;judged&quot;, and exposed in the streets to public condemnation and attacks. Having their heads shaved in public to mark them was a common punishment. Such descendants have formed a group to represent them, &quot;Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre. &quot;Another group of French, German and Austrian children of war exists under the name of Coeurs sans frontières - Herzen ohne Grenzen.&#x27;

=== Finland ===

During the wartime and the post-war period, Finnish women gave birth to 468,269 children in Finland in the period 1940–1945. A small portion, about 1,100 of the children, were fathered by foreign troops. Some 700 children were born to German soldiers, 200–300 to Soviet POWs, and 100 to Swedish volunteers. Depending much on the foreign father&#x27;s background, most of these children were left fatherless, and some of the mothers, along with their children, faced discrimination in Finnish society.

==== German soldiers ====
Following the revision of the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1941, there were no more than 200,000 German soldiers in Finland, the vast majority of them stationed in the Finnish Lapland in the period 1941–1944. According to the National Archives of Finland, as many as 3,000 Finnish women, some working for the voluntary auxiliary paramilitary organisation Lotta Svärd and some for the Wehrmacht, had relationships with German soldiers. An estimated 700 children were born to German soldiers in Finland, and were mostly unplanned. Many German soldiers were aware of safe sex and the Wehrmacht kept them well-equipped with condoms, which has been estimated to effectively keep a relatively low impregnation rate for the Finnish women who had sexual intercourse with German soldiers. A booklet published by the OKW in 1943, &quot;Der deutsche Soldat und die Frau aus fremdem Volkstum&quot;, allowed German soldiers to marry those Finnish women who could be considered to represent the &quot;Aryan race&quot;, hinting that there was some uncertainty among Nazi authorities about ethnic Finns&#x27; &quot;genetic suitability&quot;.

Finland was a co-belligerent from the summer of 1941, until September 1944 when hostilities between Germany and Finland broke out following the Finnish armistice with the Allied Powers. During the autumn of 1944 alone, some 1,000 Finnish women, two-thirds of them aged between from 17 to 24, left the country with the departing German soldiers. The reasons for leaving the country with the enemy varied, but the most common reason was a relationship with a German soldier. Subsequently, most of these women returned to Finland, as their presence was commonly unwelcome in Germany and some faced active mistreatment, such as forced labor. After the war, most of the Finnish mothers that had children with German soldiers were left as single parents. Some of these children were adopted by the Finnish men who later married the children&#x27;s mothers.

Some Finnish women who were associated with German soldiers faced discrimination in Finnish society. The discrimination was not generally as harsh as that most other European women experienced elsewhere for the same reason, mostly due to the concept of a &quot;Finnish-German brotherhood-in-arms&quot; during the co-belligerence and their shared mutual enmity with the Soviet Union. Some Soviet POWs captured by the Finns were also intimately involved with Finnish women, a situation considered far more socially unacceptable and deserving of censure (see the section below). However the children fathered by German soldiers still encountered discrimination in their youth as well.

==== Soviet prisoners of war ====
During the wartime, there were about 69,700 Soviet POWs in Finland, of which 5,700 were taken in the Winter War (1939–40) and 64,000 in the Continuation War (1941–44). Some POWs&#x27; living conditions were relatively good, as, at best, some 15,000 of them were placed on farms, where they were used as forced labor, usually working rather freely together with Finnish civilians, some of them having relationships with Finnish women. An estimated 600 Finnish women had relationships with Soviet POWs, and 200–300 children were born to POWs and Finnish women. These women&#x27;s backgrounds varied: some were unmarried, while others were widowed by the war. Some relationships were adulterous, as some of the women were married to Finnish soldiers who were absent at the time. The usage of condoms was scarce, partially due to the lack of their availability to POWs, and partially due to the lack of rural Finnish women&#x27;s awareness of condom usage. After the Moscow Armistice, Finland started to return the surviving POWs to the Soviet Union, and most of the Finnish mothers that had children with POWs were left as single parents. Some of the mothers married Finnish men afterwards.

Relationships between native women and ethnic Russian POWs were especially disapproved of in Finnish society, much more so than similar relationships with German soldiers and with POWs from other Finnic peoples, such as Karelians. A strong factor behind this greater censure was the long-lasting anti-Russian sentiment in Finland (&quot;ryssäviha&quot; in Finnish). Some women&#x27;s heads were shaved for allegedly having relationships with Soviet POWs. Pejorative terms such as &quot;ryssän heila&quot; (&quot;ryssä&#x27;s girlfriend&quot;, the word &quot;ryssä&quot; being a common Finnish slur for a Russian) and &quot;ryssän huora&quot; (&quot;ryssä&#x27;s whore&quot;) were widely used. The children fathered by Soviet POWs also faced discrimination in their youth, such as bullying in school.

==== Swedish volunteers ====
Overall there were about 11,000 Swedish volunteers who fought for Finland at some point during wartime. During the Winter War, Swedish volunteers numbered 9,640 and between 1941 and 1944, there were over 1,600 Swedish volunteers, of which about a third had previously participated in the Winter War. About 100 children were born to Finnish women and Swedish volunteers. Often these women moved to Sweden with their children.

=== Greece ===
Little is known about the Greek Wehrmacht children, since it is still an issue surrounded by taboo in Greece, but Greek children of Wehrmacht soldiers are known to have been subjected to public humiliation. Frequently, they were called &quot;Germanobastardos&quot; (Greek for &quot;German bastard&quot;). The mothers were discriminated against as well, and the children suffered both due to having a stigmatized mother and frequently an unknown father. Quite often, the mothers blamed the children for their bad situation. There is no official record of these children, but researchers estimate their number to be at least 200. The relatively low number, some authors argue, was because only a small proportion of pregnancies resulted in births, due to the mothers&#x27; fears of discrimination. Abortions were easily accessible in Greece at that time, and it is claimed that the Orthodox Church encouraged silence on the matter and assisted women in obtaining abortions.

=== Netherlands ===
The Nazis considered the women of the Netherlands to be Aryan and acceptable for fraternization by German soldiers. The Dutch Institute for War Documentation originally estimated that around 10,000 children by German fathers were born to Dutch mothers during the occupation. However, recent figures, based on newly available records at the archives of the German Wehrmacht (name of the German armed forces from 1935 to 1945), indicate that the true number could be as high as 50,000.

=== Vietnam ===

Some Japanese soldiers married Vietnamese women like Nguyen Thi Xuan and Nguyen Thi Thu and fathered multiple children with the Vietnamese women who remained behind in Vietnam while the Japanese soldiers themselves returned to Japan in 1955. The official Vietnamese historical narrative view them as children of rape and prostitution. The Japanese forced Vietnamese women to become comfort women and with Burmese, Indonesian, Thai and Filipino women they made up a notable portion of Asian comfort women in general. Japanese use of Malaysian and Vietnamese women as comfort women was corroborated by testimonies. There were comfort women stations in Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, North Korea and South Korea. Out of these relations a number of children were born that were later abandoned by their Japanese fathers after the war, while a large number of soldiers would also remain behind in Vietnam, married Vietnamese women, and raised families. 

In 1954, the Vietnamese government had ordered the Japanese soldiers to return home. They were “encouraged” to leave their families behind effectively abandoning their war children in Vietnam.

The half-Japanese children left behind in Vietnam after 1954 were subjected to harsh discrimination, meanwhile these children were often raised by single mothers who were harshly criticised for sleeping with Japanese soldiers during the war.

In 2017 the Japanese Emperor Akihito and his wife Empress Michiko visited Hanoi as at the time Japan had become the largest donor of aid to Vietnam and a top investor into the country. As a part of the official visit Emperor Akihito met with a number of war children that were abandoned after the war ended.

==Post-war children==
===Fathered by Allied Forces in Germany===

The Allied forces occupied Germany for several years after World War II. The book &quot;GIs and Fräuleins&quot;, by Maria Hohn, documents 66,000 German children born to fathers who were soldiers of Allied forces in the period 1945–55:

*American parent: 36,334
*French parent: 10,188
*British parent: 8,397
*Soviet parent: 3,105
*Belgian parent: 1,767
*Other/unknown: 6,829

==== American ====
According to Perry Biddiscombe, more than 37,000 illegitimate children were sired by American fathers in the 10 years following the German surrender (in general agreement with Hohn&#x27;s numbers cited above). Locals generally disapproved of any relations between the occupation forces and German and Austrian women. Not only were the Americans the recent enemy, but the residents feared the American fathers would abandon the mothers and children to be cared for by the local communities, which were severely impoverished after the war. A majority of the 37,000 illegitimate children ended up as wards of the social services for at least some time. Many of the children remained wards of the state for a long time, especially children of African-American fathers. The mixed-race children, called &quot;brown children&quot;, were seldom adopted in what was then a very racially homogeneous country. Around 8,000 of these children were born.
Arrangements were made for some such children to be adopted by African-American couples or families in the United States.

The food situation in occupied Germany was initially very dire. By the spring of 1946, the official ration in the US zone was no more than 1275 calories per day (much less than the minimum required to maintain health), with some areas probably receiving as little as 700. Thousands of US soldiers exploited this desperate situation to their advantage, using their ample supply of food and cigarettes (the currency of the black market) as what became known as &quot;frau bait&quot; achieving survival sex. Each side continued to view the other as the enemy, even while exchanging food for sex. The often destitute mothers of the resulting children usually received no alimony.

Between 1950 and 1955, the Allied High Commission for Germany prohibited &quot;proceedings to establish paternity or liability for maintenance of children.&quot; Even after the lifting of the ban, West German courts had little power to gain child support from American soldiers.

An unknown number exceeding 10,000 children of African American soldiers was born to British and European women through 1955. Generically, they were called Brown Babies, but were referred to in various ways in the countries in which most were born: England, Germany and Austria. A very small number was born in the Netherlands, but a 21st-century oral history project there, &quot;The Children of African American Liberators,&quot; provided an in-depth understanding of their lives into adulthood. As well, in 2016 the Folklore Museum of Vienna mounted a thorough exhibition, &quot;Black Austria. The Children of African American Occupation Soldiers.&quot;

In the earliest stages of the occupation, American soldiers were not allowed to pay maintenance for children they admitted having fathered, the military classifying any such assistance as &quot;aiding the enemy&quot;. Marriages between white US soldiers and Austrian women were prohibited until January 1946, and with German women until December 1946.

The official United States policy on war children was summed up in the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; on 8 April 1946, in the article &quot;Pregnant Frauleins Are Warned!&quot;:

Girls who are expecting a child fathered by an American soldier will be provided with no assistance by the American Army ... If the soldier denies paternity, no further action will be undertaken other than to merely inform the woman of this fact. She is to be advised to seek help from a German or Austrian welfare organization. If the soldier is already in the United States, his address is not to be communicated to the woman in question, the soldier may be honorably discharged from the army and his demobilization will in no way be delayed. Claims for child support from unmarried German and Austrian mothers will not be recognized. If the soldier voluntarily acknowledges paternity, he is to provide for the woman in an appropriate manner.

==== British ====

British troops also occupied a portion of what later was organized as West Germany. Fraternisation between soldiers and local German women was discouraged by British authorities because of the status of Germans as the enemy during the war.

Notable children of British servicemen and German mothers include Lewis Holtby, Kevin Kerr, Maik Taylor and David McAllister.

==== Canadian ====
Canada declared war on Germany in 1939, following Britain&#x27;s war declaration the week before. During the war Canadian forces participated in the Allied invasions of both Italy and Normandy. Before the invasion of continental Europe, a significant number of Canadian forces were stationed in Britain.

An estimated 22,000 children were born to British mothers and Canadian soldiers stationed in Britain. In continental Europe, it has been estimated that 6,000 were born to Canadian fathers in the Netherlands, with smaller numbers born in Belgium and other places where Canadian forces were stationed during and after the war.

A famous example is Eric Clapton.

===In the following countries===

==== Netherlands ====

On liberation, many Dutch women welcomed the Allied troops and had relationships that resulted in babies; these were called &#x27;Liberation babies&#x27;. It is estimated that about 4,000 &quot;liberation babies&quot; were fathered by Canadian soldiers before they left the area in early 1946.

====Austria====
In Austria, war children (&quot;Russenkind&quot;) by known Soviet fathers of the occupation were discriminated against, as were their mothers.

The Austrians also resented women who had relations with American soldiers, calling them &#x27;Yanks&#x27; chicks&#x27; (Amischickse) or &#x27;Dollar sluts&#x27; (Dollarflitscherl) and, in the case of those who had relations with black soldiers, &#x27;chocolate girl&#x27; (Schokoladenmädchen).
In April 1946, the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; newspaper warned &quot;pregnant Fräuleins&quot; that military authorities would provide no assistance to them or their children if the fathers were US soldiers. The paper said that a &quot;&#x27;Strength Through Joy&#x27; girl who ate from the forbidden fruit should accept the consequences,&quot; referring to a Nazi slogan.

In coordination with American groups, an Austrian welfare program was started after the war to send the mixed-race children of Austrian/African-American parents to the United States for adoption by African-American families. The children by then ranged in age from 4 to 7 years.

==Amerasians==

Probably more than 100,000 children have been born to Asian mothers and US servicemen in Asia. This occurred chiefly during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Collectively these children are known as &quot;Amerasians&quot;, a term coined by the author Pearl S. Buck.

==Lai Đại Hàn==

The term Lai Dai Han (or sometimes Lai Daihan/Lai Tai Han) is a Vietnamese term for a mixed ancestry person born to a South Korean father and a Vietnamese mother, including the victims of sexual assault by Korean soldiers, during the Vietnam War. Lai Dai Han often live at the margins of Vietnamese society.

The exact number of Lai Daihan is unknown. According to Busan Ilbo, there are at least 5,000 and as many as 30,000.

==Eurasians==
Numerous Asian-European children were also born during the colonial years of the British, French, and Dutch administrations in India and various Southeast Asian countries. In many cases, the father was a colonial civil servant, settler or military officer based in the occupied Asian country while the mother was a local. The term &quot;Eurasian&quot; is used but has variants depending on country of origin and nationality of the parents. Examples include the Indos in Indonesia, Burghers (Portuguese or Dutch) in Sri Lanka, Kristang (usually Portuguese) in Malaysia and Goans (Portuguese) and Anglo-Indians (British) in India.

==Cases of rape==
Numerous war children were born as the result of their mothers being raped by enemy forces during World War II. Military rape of conquered women has been practiced in numerous conflicts throughout human history. Recent examples include during the longstanding wars in the Congo and Sudan.

===Former Yugoslavia===
In the 1990s organizations were formed to classify such violence against women as among the prosecutable war crimes in former Yugoslavia. Some Muslim women in Bosnia who were raped in Serbian camps were aided by humanitarian organizations.

==Situation of mothers, war children and fathers==
===Prevention===
The recognition in 1989 that violence against women in the form of rape was a deliberate military strategy and human rights abuse led to the approval of an international Convention on the Rights of the Child. Since 2008, the United Nations Security Council bans such sexual violations, defining them as a war crime. The German weekly &quot;Die Zeit&quot; described this action as an historical milestone.

===Integration===
One author suggested that adoption and assimilation of a child into a new family might be a solution to prevent war children from growing up as unwanted and mobbed by people in a hostile environment.

===War children&#x27;s ignorance of origins===
Often war children never understood the reason they were being isolated or mistreated. They did not learn their father&#x27;s identities until late in life or by chance:
* by comments of their classmates, relatives or neighbours
* when they needed official documents e. g. family register, or
* after their mothers died.

In most cases, when war children tried to learn identities of their biological fathers years later, the searches were usually difficult and often in vain.

===Fathers unknown===
Occupation forces after World War II strictly interdicted fraternization by military personnel with people of the occupied territories. Couples who became involved tried to hide their relationship because of these interdictions and the resentment and disapproval by the occupied population. Fathers of war children were generally excepted from civil actions by mothers to claim alimony or child support.

Communication with the mothers of war children often ceased when the soldiers suddenly were reassigned, often without time to say goodbye. Some of the soldiers were killed in action. In the post-war period, soldier fathers were prevented by conditions from returning to former native women and war children even if they wanted to. Others had wives and families to return to at home, and denied having war children. In some cases, they never knew they had sired children when serving abroad.

===Mothers traumatized===
At the end of war, mothers with war children were prosecuted as criminals and punished in humiliating ways for their relations with the enemy. They were isolated socially and economically. Many of them could only rehabilitate themselves and become respected by marrying a fellow countryman. Long-term persecution of a former girlfriend of a German soldier is documented in a book by ANEG; she says that she was traumatized for the rest of her life.

Some of the mothers gave their war child to a home of public welfare. Others tried to integrate the child into the family formed with their new partner and children (step family). Some of the mothers died during the war.

==Children in search for their fathers==
A network of European war children, &quot;Born of War — international network&quot;, was founded in October 2005. They meet every year in Berlin to assist each other, make decisions about searching for parents, and find out new positions.

===Searches by war children of World War II===

====Changing opinions====
Since the late 20th century, as they reach retirement age, many war children from World War II have begun to search for their full identity and their roots. The legal children of a German father may also be interested in contacting the previously unknown war child of their father, if they know one or more exists. Public opinion has become more compassionate toward the past generation of war children. Few of the biological fathers are still alive. Subject to bullying and humiliation, many of the mothers never told their children about their foreign fathers.

====Norway====
The government has advised that persons trying to do research should gather the complete birth documents, including the birth certificate (not only parts of it). The Norwegian archive at Victoria Terrasse in Oslo burned down in the 1950s, and many of these important documents were lost. The Norwegian Red Cross has some records. It is often easier to trace the Norwegian mother first by Church records.

====Belgium====
The government and researchers recommend that persons search for documentary evidence from Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt, Auslandsorganisation – Amt für Volkswohlfahrt und Winterhilfswerk (1941–1944) about alimony payments. Old photographs with greetings on the back or private letters may provide clues to a father&#x27;s identity.

====France====
Since 2005 the society, &quot;Amicale Nationale des Enfants de la Guerre&quot; (ANEG), has worked in both France and Germany to help descendants of parents of mixed nationalities, whether a German father in France or French father in occupied Germany. &quot;Cœurs Sans Frontières/Herzen ohne Grenzen&quot; (Hearts without Frontiers) is another French / German organization supporting the search for family members of French children whose fathers were German soldiers during the occupation and German or Austrian children whose fathers were prisoners, forced laborers or French soldiers in the immediate post-war period.

====Germany====
Mixed children of white German women and black WWI soldiers were called &quot;Rhineland Bastards&quot;. This phrase, along with many other racial epithets, reinforced a negative stereotype that black men were beasts and did not care for their children. The &quot;Brown Babies&quot; became an international concern, with the African-American press publicizing and advertising for adoptions. In these efforts there was a distinct emphasis in both countries on the skin color of the child (for example: advertised as &quot;Brown Babies&quot; rather than simply as &quot;orphans&quot;). This was important because a dark skin color both excluded children from German national identity, and allowed them more acceptance in the United States than was offered to light-skinned &quot;German&quot; babies. This distinction was further emphasized when &quot;Brown Babies&quot; who were adopted into the US were afterwards forbidden from speaking their native German. This served efforts to erase an entire generation of Afro-Germans.
Since 2009 the German government has granted German citizenship upon application and documentation by war children who were born in France to French mothers and German soldier fathers in WWII.

====Search in German archives====
Several central files are part of the German archives:
* At Deutsche Dienststelle (WASt), military movements of German soldiers of World War II can be traced. Children in search of their German fathers (soldiers, prisoners of Second World War) may find some clues here.
* German Federal Archives-Military Archives (in German: Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv) in Freiburg im Breisgau has some copies of personal documents. For each unit of the former Wehrmacht, it has the so-called &quot;Kriegstagebücher&quot; (reports of daily events) where movements, and losses per day and unit were recorded.
* Archives of former Berlin Document Center contained details on personal membership in Nazi party and organisations of the German Third Reich. These archives were transferred to German Federal Archives, branch Berlin-Lichterfelde. Search for people concerned are allowed 30 years after death. Details needed are surname, first name, date of birth, occupation and range of activities.
* The Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge has a direct access file, with a searchable online database, of all known German war graves of World War I and II.

===Post-war children===
Post-war war children often search in vain: their knowledge of their father&#x27;s personal data may be vague, some archives are closed, and much data has been lost.

====Search for US fathers====
War children by American soldiers may gain assistance in their search from the organization GITrace. Since 2009 the German-based association, GI Babies Germany e.V., also assists in the search for the roots of children of German mothers and GIs in the occupation.

====Search for Canadian fathers====
Organization Canadian Roots UK helps war children in Great Britain to trace a Canadian father. Conversely it also helps Canadian veteran fathers to trace a child born in the UK during or shortly after WWII.

Kodagu is home for species endemic to the Western Ghats. It has large tiger and elephant populations as well. As per the elephant census of 2023, Kodagu with 1,013 elephants, had nearly one-sixth of total elephant population in Karnataka, second only to Chamarajanagar.

Dr. Mantar Gowda represents the Madikeri constituency while A.S Ponnanna represents the Virajpet constituency; they are from the Indian National Congress. Kodagu, formerly part of the Kodagu-Dakshina Kannada (Mangalore) constituency, is now part of the Mysore-Kodagu Lok Sabha constituency parliamentary constituency. The current MP for this constituency is Shri Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, from the Bharatiya Janata Party.

The Codava National Council and &quot;Kodava Rashtriya Samiti&quot; are campaigning for autonomy to Kodagu district which would have made Coorg more prosperous and independent.

==History==


The Kodavas were the earliest inhabitants and agriculturists in Kodagu, having lived there for centuries. Kodavas being a warrior community as well, they carried arms during times of war and had their own chieftains.

The earliest mention about Coorg can be seen in the works those date back to Sangam period (300 BCE - 300 CE). The Ezhimala dynasty had jurisdiction over two &quot;Nadu&quot;s - The coastal &quot;Poozhinadu&quot; and the hilly eastern &quot;Karkanadu&quot;. According to the works of Sangam literature, &quot;Poozhinadu&quot; consisted much of the coastal belt between Mangalore and Kozhikode. &quot;Karkanadu&quot; consisted of Wayanad-Gudalur hilly region with parts of Kodagu (Coorg).

The Haleri dynasty, an offshoot of the Keladi Nayakas, ruled Kodagu between 1600 and 1834. Later the British ruled Kodagu from 1834, after the Coorg War, until India&#x27;s independence in 1947. A separate state (called Coorg State) until then, in 1956 Kodagu was merged with the Mysore State (now Karnataka).

===Coorg in British India===
In 1834, the East India Company annexed Kodagu into British India, after deposing Chikka Virarajendra of the Kodagu kingdom, as &#x27;Coorg&#x27;. British rule led to the establishment of educational institutions, introduction of scientific coffee cultivation, better administration and improvement of the economy. This reference notwithstanding - we should remember that the colonial rule by the British in India was about exploitation of resources and Kodagu provided a lot of scope for economic benefits to a colonising empire.

==Demographics==

According to the 2011 census of India, Kodagu has a population of 554,519, roughly equal to the Solomon Islands or the US state of Wyoming. This ranks it 539 out of 640 districts in India in terms of population. The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001–2011 was 1.13%. Kodagu has a sex ratio of 1019 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 82.52%. 14.61% of the population lives in urban areas. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes make up 13.27% and 10.47% of the population respectively.
===Religion===
Hindus are the vast majority. They include the Kodava people, other Kodava language speakers, Arebhashe Gowdas, Brahmins, most Yeravas and Kurubas.
A huge minority of Muslims dot the Coorg district, especially the towns of Kushalnagar, Virajpet and Mercara. A sizeable of them are the Nawayaths who shifted in the eighties from Bhatkal and Murdeshwar in order to pursue coffee &amp; arecanut plantations and textile business. The numerous mosque dotting the landscape is the testimony of Muslim presence in the district.

A small number of Mangalorean Catholics are also found in Coorg. They are mostly descended from those Konkani Catholics who fled the roundup and, later, captivity by Tippu Sultan. These immigrants were welcomed by Raja Veerarajendra (himself a former captive of Tippu Sultan, having escaped six years of captivity in 1788) who realising their usefulness and expertise as agriculturists, gave them lands and tax breaks and built a church for them.

===Language===
At the time of the 2011 census, 30.91% of the population spoke Kannada, 20.83% Malayalam, 14.86% Kodava, 8.92% Tulu, 5.81% Are, 4.66% Yerava, 4.23% Tamil, 2.95% Urdu, 1.74% Kurumba, 1.55% Telugu and 1.16% Konkani as their first language.

Are Bhashe, a dialect of Kannada, Tulu and Kodava language are native to Kodagu district. Kodava Language uses the Official Script Invented by Dr IM Muthanna in 1970.

====Kodava people and other Kodava language speakers====
According to &quot;Karnataka Kodava Sahitya Academy&quot; (Karnataka&#x27;s Kodava Literary Academy), apart from Kodavas, and their related groups, the &quot;Amma Kodavas&quot;, the Kodava &quot;Peggade&quot; (Kodagu Heggade) and the Kodava &quot;Maaple&quot; (Kodava Muslims), 18 other smaller-numbered ethnic groups speak Kodava Takk in and outside the district including the &quot;Iri&quot; (&quot;Airi&quot;, or the carpenters and the village smiths), the &quot;Koyava&quot;, the &quot;Banna&quot;, the Kodagu &quot;Madivala&quot; (washermen), the Kodagu &quot;Hajama&quot; (barber, also called Nainda), the &quot;Kembatti&quot; Poleya (household servants and labourers) and the &quot;Meda&quot; (basket and mat weavers and drummers).

Among other Kodava speaking communities are: the &quot;Heggades&quot;, cultivators from shimogga; the &quot;Kodava Nair&quot;, cultivators from Kerala State; the &quot;Ayiri&quot;, who constitute the artisan caste; the &quot;Medas&quot;, who are basket and mat-weavers and act as drummers at feasts; the &quot;Binepatta&quot;, originally wandering musicians from Malabar, now farmers; and the &quot;Kavadi&quot;, cultivators settled in Yedenalknad (Virajpet). All these groups speak the Kodava language and conform generally to Kodava customs and dress.

====Kodagu Arebhashe Gowda====
Less frequent are Tulu speakers Billavas, Mogaveeras, Bunts, Goud Saraswat Brahmins.

The Arebhashe gowdas, or &quot;Kodagu Gowdas&quot;, and Tulu Gowdas, are an ethnic group of Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu. They live in Sulya (in Dakshina Kannada) and in parts of Somwarpet, Kushalanagar, Bhagamandala and Madikeri. They speak a language known as Arebhashe a dialect of Kannada. Guddemane Appaiah Gowda along with many other freedom fighters from different communities revolted against the British in an armed struggle which covered entire Kodagu and Dakshina Kannada. This was one of the earliest freedom movements against the British called &quot;Amara Sulliada Swantantrya Sangraama&quot; (&quot;Amara Sulya Dhange&quot; formally called the &#x27;Coorg Rebellion&#x27; by the British) started in 1837.

==Tourism==

Kodagu is rated as one of the top hill station destinations in India. Some of the most popular tourist attractions in Kodagu include Talakaveri, Bhagamandala, Nisargadhama, Abbey Falls, Dubare, Nagarahole National Park, Iruppu Falls, and the Tibetan Buddhist Golden Temple.

*Talakaveri is the place where the River Kaveri originates. The temple on the riverbanks here is dedicated to Lord Brahma, and is one of only two temples dedicated to Brahma in India and Southeast Asia. Bhagamandala is situated at the Sangama (confluence) of two rivers, the Kaveri and the Kannika. A third river, the Sujyothi, is said to join from underground, and hence this spot is called the Triveni Sangama. Iruppu Falls is a sacred Kodagu Hindu spot in South Kodagu in the Brahmagiri hill range. The Lakshmana Tirtha River, with the waterfalls, flows nearby and has a Rameshwara temple on its banks. It is said that this sacred river was created when Laxmana, prince of Ayodhya and younger brother of Lord Rama, shot an arrow into nearby hill, the Brahmagiri hill. Chelavara falls and Thadiandamol peak are also in South Kodagu. Nagarahole is a national park and wildlife resort.
*Madikeri is the capital of the district and Raja&#x27;s Seat park is popular with tourists. Kootu Poley dam is also popular among tourists. Omkareshwara Temple is a beautiful temple built in the Indo-Sarcenic style in Coorg. A legend is associated with the temple, built by Lingarajendra II in 1820 CE. The king put to death a pious Brahmin who dared to protest against his misdeeds. The spirit of the dead man began to plague the king day and night. On the advice of wise men, the king built this temple and installed a Shivalinga procured from Kashi, North India. St. Mark&#x27;s Church is located within the Mercara Fort and was raised in 1859, by the officers and men of the East India Company. The building was funded by the Government of Madras, and placed under the Church of England in India, Diocese of Madras. The Church was closed after Indian independence, and taken over by the Government of Karnataka in 1971. The building now houses the Madikeri Fort Museum, managed by the Karnataka State Archaeological Department.
*Dubare is mainly an elephant-capturing and training camp of the Forest Department at the edge of Dubare forest; on the bank of the river Kaveri along the Kushalanagara – Siddapura road. Nisargadhama is a man-made island and picnic spot near Kushalanagara, formed by the river Kaveri. The Tibetan Buddhist Golden Temple is at Bylakuppe near Kushalnagara (Mysore district), in the Tibetan refugee settlement.
*Abbey Falls is a scenic waterfall 5 km from Madikeri. Mallalli falls is 25 km from Somawarapet, downhill of the Pushpagiri hills. Mandalapatti is 28 km from Madikeri. On the way to Abbey Falls, before 3 km from Abbey Falls take right, from there 25 km. Kote Betta temple, Kote Abbey falls are also in North Kodagu.

<text>A power outage, also called a powercut, a power out, a power failure, a power blackout, a power loss, a blackout or a power drought — is the loss of the electrical power network supply to an end user.

There are many causes of power failures in an electricity network. Examples of these causes include faults at power stations, damage to electric transmission lines, substations or other parts of the distribution system, a short circuit, cascading failure, fuse or circuit breaker operation.

Power failures are particularly critical at sites where the environment and public safety are at risk. Institutions such as hospitals, sewage treatment plants, and mines will usually have backup power sources such as standby generators, which will automatically start up when electrical power is lost. Other critical systems, such as telecommunication, are also required to have emergency power. The battery room of a telephone exchange usually has arrays of lead–acid batteries for backup and also a socket for connecting a generator during extended periods of outage.
During a power outage, there is a disruption in the supply of electricity, resulting in a loss of power to homes, businesses, and other facilities. Power outages can occur for various reasons, including severe weather conditions (e.g. storms, hurricanes, or blizzards), earthquakes, equipment failure, grid overload, or planned maintenance.

== Types ==

Power outages are categorized into three different phenomena, relating to the duration and effect of the outage:

* A transient fault is a loss of power typically caused by a fault on a power line, e.g. a short circuit or flashover. Power is automatically restored once the fault is cleared.
* A brownout is a drop in voltage in an electrical power supply. The term brownout comes from the dimming experienced by incandescent lighting when the voltage sags. Brownouts can cause poor performance of equipment or even incorrect operation. 
* A blackout is the total loss of power to a wider area and of long duration. It is the most severe form of power outage that can occur. Blackouts which result from or result in power stations tripping are particularly difficult to recover from quickly. Outages may last from a few minutes to a few weeks depending on the nature of the blackout and the configuration of the electrical network. 

Rolling blackouts occur when demand for electricity exceeds supply, and allow some customers to receive power at the required voltage at the expense of other customers who get no power at all. They are a common occurrence in developing countries, and may be scheduled in advance or occur without warning. They have also occurred in developed countries, for example in the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001, when government deregulation destabilized the wholesale electricity market. Blackouts are also used as a public safety measure, such as to prevent a gas leak from catching fire (for example, power was cut to several towns in response to the Merrimack Valley gas explosions), or to prevent wildfires around poorly maintained transmission lines (such as during the 2019 California power shutoffs).

== Protecting the power system from outages ==
In power supply networks, the power generation and the electrical load (demand) must be very close to equal every second to avoid overloading of network components, which can severely damage them. Protective relays and fuses are used to automatically detect overloads and to disconnect circuits at risk of damage.

Under certain conditions, a network component shutting down can cause current fluctuations in neighboring segments of the network leading to a cascading failure of a larger section of the network. This may range from a building, to a block, to an entire city, to an entire electrical grid.

Modern power systems are designed to be resistant to this sort of cascading failure, but it may be unavoidable (see below). Moreover, since there is no short-term economic benefit to preventing rare large-scale failures, researchers have expressed concern that there is a tendency to erode the resilience of the network over time, which is only corrected after a major failure occurs. In a 2003 publication, Carreras and co-authors claimed that reducing the likelihood of small outages only increases the likelihood of larger ones. In that case, the short-term economic benefit of keeping the individual customer happy increases the likelihood of large-scale blackouts.

The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing in October 2018 to examine &quot;black start&quot;, the process of restoring electricity after a system-wide power loss. The hearing&#x27;s purpose was for Congress to learn about what the backup plans are in the electric utility industry in the case that the electric grid is damaged. Threats to the electrical grid include cyberattacks, solar storms, and severe weather, among others. For example, the &quot;Northeast Blackout of 2003&quot; was caused when overgrown trees touched high-voltage power lines. Around 55 million people in the U.S. and Canada lost power, and restoring it cost around $6 billion.

== Protecting computer systems from power outages ==
Computer systems and other electronic devices containing logic circuitry are susceptible to data loss or hardware damage that can be caused by the sudden loss of power. These can include data networking equipment, video projectors, alarm systems as well as computers. To protect computer systems against this, the use of an uninterruptible power supply or &#x27;UPS&#x27; can provide a constant flow of electricity if a primary power supply becomes unavailable for a short period of time. To protect against surges (events where voltages increase for a few seconds), which can damage hardware when power is restored, a special device called a surge protector that absorbs the excess voltage can be used.

== Restoring power after a wide-area outage ==
Restoring power after a wide-area outage can be difficult, as power stations need to be brought back online. Normally, this is done with the help of power from the rest of the grid. In the total absence of grid power, a so-called black start needs to be performed to bootstrap the power grid into operation. The means of doing so will depend greatly on local circumstances and operational policies, but typically transmission utilities will establish localized &#x27;power islands&#x27; which are then progressively coupled together. To maintain supply frequencies within tolerable limits during this process, demand must be reconnected at the same pace that generation is restored, requiring close coordination between power stations, transmission and distribution organizations.

== Blackout inevitability and electric sustainability ==
=== Self-organized criticality ===
It has been argued on the basis of historical data and computer modeling that power grids are self-organized critical systems. These systems exhibit unavoidable disturbances of all sizes, up to the size of the entire system. This phenomenon has been attributed to steadily increasing demand/load, the economics of running a power company, and the limits of modern engineering.

While blackout frequency has been shown to be reduced by operating it further from its critical point, it generally is not economically feasible, causing providers to increase the average load over time or upgrade less often resulting in the grid moving itself closer to its critical point. Conversely, a system past the critical point will experience too many blackouts leading to system-wide upgrades moving it back below the critical point. The term critical point of the system is used here in the sense of statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, representing the point where a system undergoes a phase transition; in this case the transition from a steady reliable grid with few cascading failures to a very sporadic unreliable grid with common cascading failures. Near the critical point the relationship between blackout frequency and size follows a power-law distribution.

Cascading failure becomes much more common close to this critical point. The power-law relationship is seen in both historical data and model systems. The practice of operating these systems much closer to their maximum capacity leads to magnified effects of random, unavoidable disturbances due to aging, weather, human interaction etc. While near the critical point, these failures have a greater effect on the surrounding components due to individual components carrying a larger load. This results in the larger load from the failing component having to be redistributed in larger quantities across the system, making it more likely for additional components not directly affected by the disturbance to fail, igniting costly and dangerous cascading failures. These initial disturbances causing blackouts are all the more unexpected and unavoidable due to actions of the power suppliers to prevent obvious disturbances (cutting back trees, separating lines in windy areas, replacing aging components etc.). The complexity of most power grids often makes the initial cause of a blackout extremely hard to identify.

Leaders are dismissive of system theories that conclude that blackouts are inevitable, but do agree that the basic operation of the grid must be changed. The Electric Power Research Institute champions the use of smart grid features such as power control devices employing advanced sensors to coordinate the grid. Others advocate greater use of electronically controlled high-voltage direct current (HVDC) firebreaks to prevent disturbances from cascading across AC lines in a wide area grid.

=== OPA model ===
In 2002, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Power System Engineering Research Center of the University of Wisconsin (PSerc), and the University of Alaska Fairbanks proposed a mathematical model for the behavior of electrical distribution systems. This model has become known as the OPA model, a reference to the names of the authors&#x27; institutions. OPA is a cascading failure model. Other cascading failure models include Manchester, Hidden failure, CASCADE, and Branching. The OPA model was quantitatively compared with a complex networks model of a cascading failure – Crucitti–Latora–Marchiori (CLM) model, showing that both models exhibit similar phase transitions in the average network damage (load shed/demand in OPA, path damage in CLM), with respect to transmission capacity.

=== Mitigation of power outage frequency ===
The effects of trying to mitigate cascading failures near the critical point in an economically feasible fashion are often shown to not be beneficial and often even detrimental. Four mitigation methods have been tested using the &quot;OPA&quot; blackout model:

* Increase critical number of failures causing cascading blackouts – Shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts.
* Increase individual power line max load – Shown to increase the frequency of smaller blackouts and decrease that of larger blackouts.
* Combination of increasing critical number and max load of lines – Shown to have no significant effect on either size of blackout. The resulting minor reduction in the frequency of blackouts is projected to not be worth the cost of the implementation.
* Increase the excess power available to the grid – Shown to decrease the frequency of smaller blackouts but increase that of larger blackouts.

In addition to the finding of each mitigation strategy having a cost-benefit relationship with regards to frequency of small and large blackouts, the total number of blackout events was not significantly reduced by any of the above-mentioned mitigation measures.

A complex network-based model to control large cascading failures (blackouts) &quot;using local information only&quot; was proposed by A. E. Motter.

In 2015, one of the solutions proposed to reduce the impact of power outage was introduced by M. S. Saleh.

<text>The arrow of time, also called time&#x27;s arrow, is the concept positing the &quot;one-way direction&quot; or &quot;asymmetry&quot; of time. It was developed in 1927 by the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, and is an unsolved general physics question. This direction, according to Eddington, could be determined by studying the organization of atoms, molecules, and bodies, and might be drawn upon a four-dimensional relativistic map of the world (&quot;a solid block of paper&quot;).

The arrow of time paradox was originally recognized in the 1800s for gases (and other substances) as a discrepancy between microscopic and macroscopic description of thermodynamics / statistical physics: at the microscopic level physical processes are believed to be either entirely or mostly time-symmetric: if the direction of time were to reverse, the theoretical statements that describe them would remain true. Yet at the macroscopic level it often appears that this is not the case: there is an obvious direction (or &quot;flow&quot;) of time.

== Overview ==
The symmetry of time (T-symmetry) can be understood simply as the following: if time were perfectly symmetrical, a video of real events would seem realistic whether played forwards or backwards. Gravity, for example, is a time-reversible force. A ball that is tossed up, slows to a stop, and falls is a case where recordings would look equally realistic forwards and backwards. The system is T-symmetrical. However, the process of the ball bouncing and eventually coming to a stop is not time-reversible. While going forward, kinetic energy is dissipated and entropy is increased. Entropy may be one of the few processes that is not time-reversible. According to the statistical notion of increasing entropy, the &quot;arrow&quot; of time is identified with a decrease of free energy.

In his book &quot;The Big Picture&quot;, physicist Sean M. Carroll compares the asymmetry of time to the asymmetry of space: While physical laws are in general isotropic, near Earth there is an obvious distinction between &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;, due to proximity to this huge body, which breaks the symmetry of space. Similarly, physical laws are in general symmetric to the flipping of time direction, but near the Big Bang (i.e., in the first many trillions of years following it), there is an obvious distinction between &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;backward&quot; in time, due to relative proximity to this special event, which breaks the symmetry of time. Under this view, all the arrows of time are a result of our relative proximity in time to the Big Bang and the special circumstances that existed then. (Strictly speaking, the weak interactions are asymmetric to both spatial reflection and to flipping of the time direction. However, they do obey a more complicated symmetry that includes both.)

== Conception by Eddington ==
In the 1928 book &quot;The Nature of the Physical World&quot;, which helped to popularize the concept, Eddington stated:

Let us draw an arrow arbitrarily. If as we follow the arrow we find more and more of the random element in the state of the world, then the arrow is pointing towards the future; if the random element decreases the arrow points towards the past. That is the only distinction known to physics. This follows at once if our fundamental contention is admitted that the introduction of randomness is the only thing which cannot be undone. I shall use the phrase &#x27;time&#x27;s arrow&#x27; to express this one-way property of time which has no analogue in space.

Eddington then gives three points to note about this arrow:

# It is vividly recognized by consciousness.
# It is equally insisted on by our reasoning faculty, which tells us that a reversal of the arrow would render the external world nonsensical.
# It makes no appearance in physical science except in the study of organization of a number of individuals. (In other words, it is only observed in entropy, a statistical mechanics phenomenon arising from a system.)

== Arrows ==
=== Psychological/perceptual arrow of time ===
A related mental arrow arises because one has the sense that one&#x27;s perception is a continuous movement from the known past to the unknown future. This phenomenon has two aspects: &quot;memory&quot; (we remember the past but not the future) and &quot;volition&quot; (we feel we can influence the future but not the past). The two aspects are a consequence of the causal arrow of time: past events (but not future events) are the cause of our present memories, as more and more correlations are formed between the outer world and our brain (see correlations and the arrow of time); and our present volitions and actions are causes of future events. This is because the increase of entropy is thought to be related to increase of both correlations between a system and its surroundings and of the overall complexity, under an appropriate definition; thus all increase together with time.

Past and future are also psychologically associated with additional notions. English, along with other languages, tends to associate the past with &quot;behind&quot; and the future with &quot;ahead&quot;, with expressions such as &quot;to look forward to welcoming you&quot;, &quot;to look back to the good old times&quot;, or &quot;to be years ahead&quot;. However, this association of &quot;behind ⇔ past&quot; and &quot;ahead ⇔ future&quot; is culturally determined. For example, the Aymara language associates &quot;ahead ⇔ past&quot; and &quot;behind ⇔ future&quot; both in terms of terminology and gestures, corresponding to the past being observed and the future being unobserved. Similarly, the Chinese term for &quot;the day after tomorrow&quot; 後天 (&quot;hòutiān&quot;) literally means &quot;after (or behind) day&quot;, whereas &quot;the day before yesterday&quot; 前天 (&quot;qiántiān&quot;) is literally &quot;preceding (or in front) day&quot;, and Chinese speakers spontaneously gesture in front for the past and behind for the future, although there are conflicting findings on whether they perceive the ego to be in front of or behind the past. There are no languages that place the past and future on a left–right axis (e.g., there is no expression in English such as &quot;*the meeting was moved to the left&quot;), although at least English speakers associate the past with the left and the future with the right, which seems to have its origin in the left-to-right writing system.

The words &quot;yesterday&quot; and &quot;tomorrow&quot; both translate to the same word in Hindi: कल (&quot;kal&quot;), meaning &quot;[one] day remote from today.&quot; The ambiguity is resolved by verb tense. परसों (&quot;parson&quot;) is used for both &quot;day before yesterday&quot; and &quot;day after tomorrow&quot;, or &quot;two days from today&quot;.

तरसों (&quot;tarson&quot;) is used for &quot;three days from today&quot; and नरसों (&quot;narson&quot;) is used for &quot;four days from today&quot;.

The other side of the psychological passage of time is in the realm of volition and action. We plan and often execute actions intended to affect the course of events in the future. From the Rubaiyat:

&lt;poem&gt;
The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
 Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit.
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
 Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.
&lt;/poem&gt;
— Omar Khayyam (translation by Edward Fitzgerald).
In June 2022, researchers reported in &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; finding that salamanders were demonstrating counter-intuitive responses to the arrow of time in how their eyes perceived different stimuli.
=== Thermodynamic arrow of time ===

The arrow of time is the &quot;one-way direction&quot; or &quot;asymmetry&quot; of time. The thermodynamic arrow of time is provided by the second law of thermodynamics, which says that in an isolated system, entropy tends to increase with time. Entropy can be thought of as a measure of microscopic disorder; thus the second law implies that time is asymmetrical with respect to the amount of order in an isolated system: as a system advances through time, it becomes more statistically disordered. This asymmetry can be used empirically to distinguish between future and past, though measuring entropy does not accurately measure time. Also, in an open system, entropy can decrease with time. An interesting thought experiment would be to ask: &quot;if entropy was increased in an open system, would the arrow of time flip in polarity and point towards the past.&quot; [citation required]

British physicist Sir Alfred Brian Pippard wrote: &quot;There is thus no justification for the view, often glibly repeated, that the Second Law of Thermodynamics is only statistically true, in the sense that microscopic violations repeatedly occur, but never violations of any serious magnitude. On the contrary, no evidence has ever been presented that the Second Law breaks down under any circumstances.&quot; However, there are a number of paradoxes regarding violation of the second law of thermodynamics, one of them due to the Poincaré recurrence theorem.

This arrow of time seems to be related to all other arrows of time and arguably underlies some of them, with the exception of the weak arrow of time.

Harold Blum&#x27;s 1951 book &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow and Evolution&quot; discusses &quot;the relationship between time&#x27;s arrow (the second law of thermodynamics) and organic evolution.&quot; This influential text explores &quot;irreversibility and direction in evolution and order, negentropy, and evolution.&quot; Blum argues that evolution followed specific patterns predetermined by the inorganic nature of the earth and its thermodynamic processes.

=== Cosmological arrow of time ===

The cosmological arrow of time points in the direction of the universe&#x27;s expansion. It may be linked to the thermodynamic arrow, with the universe heading towards a heat death &quot;(Big Chill)&quot; as the amount of Thermodynamic free energy becomes negligible. Alternatively, it may be an artifact of our place in the universe&#x27;s evolution (see the Anthropic bias), with this arrow reversing as gravity pulls everything back into a Big Crunch.

If this arrow of time is related to the other arrows of time, then the future is &quot;by definition&quot; the direction towards which the universe becomes bigger. Thus, the universe expands—rather than shrinks—by definition.

The thermodynamic arrow of time and the second law of thermodynamics are thought to be a consequence of the initial conditions in the early universe. Therefore, they ultimately result from the cosmological set-up.

=== Radiative arrow of time ===
Waves, from radio waves to sound waves to those on a pond from throwing a stone, expand outward from their source, even though the wave equations accommodate solutions of convergent waves as well as radiative ones. This arrow has been reversed in carefully worked experiments that created convergent waves, so this arrow probably follows from the thermodynamic arrow in that meeting the conditions to produce a convergent wave requires more order than the conditions for a radiative wave. Put differently, the probability for initial conditions that produce a convergent wave is much lower than the probability for initial conditions that produce a radiative wave. In fact, normally a radiative wave increases entropy, while a convergent wave decreases it, making the latter contradictory to the second law of thermodynamics in usual circumstances.

=== Causal arrow of time ===
A cause precedes its effect: the causal event occurs before the event it causes or affects. Birth, for example, follows a successful conception and not vice versa. Thus causality is intimately bound up with time&#x27;s arrow.

An epistemological problem with using causality as an arrow of time is that, as David Hume maintained, the causal relation &quot;per se&quot; cannot be perceived; one only perceives sequences of events. Furthermore, it is surprisingly difficult to provide a clear explanation of what the terms cause and effect really mean, or to define the events to which they refer. However, it does seem evident that dropping a cup of water is a cause while the cup subsequently shattering and spilling the water is the effect.

Physically speaking, correlations between a system and its surrounding are thought to increase with entropy, and have been shown to be equivalent to it in a simplified case of a finite system interacting with the environment. The assumption of low initial entropy is indeed equivalent to assuming no initial correlations in the system; thus correlations can only be created as we move forward in time, not backwards. Controlling the future, or causing something to happen, creates correlations between the doer and the effect, and therefore the relation between cause and effect is a result of the thermodynamic arrow of time, a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Indeed, in the above example of the cup dropping, the initial conditions have high order and low entropy, while the final state has high correlations between relatively distant parts of the system – the shattered pieces of the cup, as well as the spilled water, and the object that caused the cup to drop.

=== Quantum arrow of time ===
Quantum evolution is governed by equations of motions that are time-symmetric (such as the Schrödinger equation in the non-relativistic approximation), and by wave function collapse, which is a time-irreversible process, and is only physically real in explicit collapse interpretations of quantum theory, such as the  Diósi–Penrose model, the Ghirardi–Rimini–Weber theory, or the Transactional interpretation, which uses the direct-action or &quot;absorber&quot; theory of fields. 

The conventional approach is to assume that quantum decoherence explains irreversibility and the second law of thermodynamics, thus claiming to derive the quantum arrow of time from the thermodynamic arrow of time; however this is a matter of some debate, since the underlying dynamics is assumed to be unitary and thus reversible.
A conventional account of decoherence is to say that following any particle scattering or interaction between two larger systems, the relative phases of the two systems are at first orderly related, but subsequent interactions (with additional particles or systems) make them less so, so that the two systems become decoherent. Thus decoherence is a form of increase in microscopic disorder in short, decoherence increases entropy. Two decoherent systems can no longer interact via quantum superposition, unless they become coherent again, which is normally impossible, by the second law of thermodynamics. In the language of relational quantum mechanics, the observer becomes entangled with the measured state, where this entanglement increases entropy. As stated by Seth Lloyd, &quot;the arrow of time is an arrow of increasing correlations&quot;.

However, under special circumstances, one can prepare initial conditions that will cause a decrease in decoherence and in entropy. This has been shown experimentally in 2019, when a team of Russian scientists reported the reversal of the quantum arrow of time on an IBM quantum computer, in an experiment supporting the understanding of the quantum arrow of time as emerging from the thermodynamic one. By observing the state of the quantum computer made of two and later three superconducting qubits, they found that in 85% of the cases, the two-qubit computer returned to the initial state. The state&#x27;s reversal was made by a special program, similarly to the random microwave background fluctuation in the case of the electron. However, according to the estimations, throughout the age of the universe (13.7 billion years) such a reversal of the electron&#x27;s state would only happen once, for 0.06 nanoseconds. The scientists&#x27; experiment led to the possibility of a quantum algorithm that reverses a given quantum state through complex conjugation of the state.

Note that quantum decoherence merely allows the appearance of quantum wave collapse (based on the vanishing of diagonal elements of the density matrix); it is a matter of dispute whether the collapse itself actually takes place or is redundant and apparent only. While the theory of quantum decoherence is widely accepted and has been supported experimentally at the level of the applicable density matrix, the conventional theory&#x27;s inability to predict actual measurement outcomes via non-unitary collapse remains. That is, the density matrix obtained from standard unitary-only decoherence (without actual collapse) is an improper mixture that cannot be interpreted as reflecting a determinate measurement outcome. Thus the arrow of time question continues to be addressed by way of explicit collapse approaches.

=== Particle physics (weak) arrow of time ===

Certain subatomic interactions involving the weak nuclear force violate the conservation of both parity and charge conjugation, but only very rarely. An example is the kaon decay. According to the CPT theorem, this means they should also be time-irreversible, and so establish an arrow of time. Such processes should be responsible for matter creation in the early universe.

That the combination of parity and charge conjugation is broken so rarely means that this arrow only &quot;barely&quot; points in one direction, setting it apart from the other arrows whose direction is much more obvious. This arrow had not been linked to any large-scale temporal behaviour until the work of Joan Vaccaro, who showed that T violation could be responsible for conservation laws and dynamics.

<text>Diaspora is a hard science fiction novel by the Australian writer Greg Egan which first appeared in print in 1997. It originated as the short story &quot;Wang&#x27;s Carpets&quot; which originally appeared in the Greg Bear-edited anthology &quot;New Legends&quot; (Legend, London, 1995). The story appears as a chapter of the novel.

==Setting and premise==
An appended glossary explains many of the specialist terms in the novel. Egan invents several new theories of physics, beginning with Kozuch Theory, the dominant physics paradigm for nearly nine hundred years before the beginning of the novel. Kozuch Theory treats elementary particles as semi-point-like wormholes, whose properties can be explained entirely in terms of their geometries in six dimensions. Certain assumptions common to Egan&#x27;s works inform the plot.

This novel&#x27;s setting is a posthuman future, in which transhumanism long ago (during the mid 21st century) became the default philosophy embraced by the vast majority of human cultures.

Most of the characters choose a neutral gender; Keri Hulme&#x27;s gender-neutral pronouns &quot;ve&quot;, &quot;vis&quot;, and &quot;ver&quot; are used for them.

By 2975 CE (Universal Time), the year in which the novel begins, humanity has &quot;speciated&quot; into three distinct groupings:

* &quot;fleshers&quot;, biological societies consisting of &quot;statics&quot;, the original, naturally-evolving race of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, and a wide variety of &quot;exuberant&quot; derivatives, who have modified their genes beyond the static baseline. These include enhancements such as disease resistance, life extension, intelligence amplification, and the ability to allow selected transhumans to thrive in new environments, such as the sea. There even exists a subculture (the dream apes) whose ancestors bred out the capacity for speech and some of the higher brain-functions, apparently in order to attain a primal innocence and rapport with nature. In contrast to 21st-century society prior to the novel&#x27;s &quot;Introdus&quot; event, the vast profusion of qualitatively different types of fleshers has made any sort of global civilisation impossible. This divergence has prompted the development of a culture of &quot;Bridgers&quot; who modify their own minds to form a chain of intermediates between exuberant strains.
* &quot;gleisner robots&quot;, individual software-based intelligences housed inside artificial anthropoid, or flesher-shaped, physical bodies (from a design by a corporation named Gleisner) who interact with the world in flesher-paced &quot;real time&quot;, a trait which they regard as important, as they consider the polis citizens too remote and solipsistic. The gleisners live in space, mostly in the asteroid belt, and in various other places in the Solar System; Egan implies that they long ago agreed to leave Earth to the fleshers to avoid conflict. They eventually implement a program of interstellar exploration using a fleet of 63 ships, targeting the nearest 21 stars.
* the &quot;citizens&quot;, intelligence as disembodied computer software running entirely within simulated reality-based communities known as &quot;polises&quot;. These represent the majority by far of &quot;humanity&quot; in the novel, followed in a distant second place by the gleisners. Together with vast networks of sensors, probes, drones and satellites throughout the Solar system, they collectively make up the &quot;Coalition of Polises&quot;, the backbone and bulk of human civilisation. They interact primarily in virtual environments called &quot;scapes&quot;, through the use of avatars or icons. The citizens of the Coalition view the gleisners and their colonial aspirations as puerile and ultimately futile, believing that only &quot;bacteria with spaceships. . . knowing no better and having no choice&quot; would attempt to deface the galaxy with mass colonisation, especially if virtual realities afford limitless possibilities at a small fraction of the total resource-consumption.

&quot;Diaspora&quot; focuses in large part on the nature of life and intelligence in a post-human context, and questions the meaning of life and the meaning of desires. If, for instance, the meaning of human life and human desires is bound up with ancestral human biology (&quot;to spread one&#x27;s genes&quot;), then what meaning do lives and desires have, and what serves as the basis of values when biology no longer forms a part of life?

==Plot summary==
&quot;Diaspora&quot; begins with a description of &quot;orphanogenesis&quot;, the birthing of a citizen without any ancestors (the majority of citizens descend from fleshers uploaded at some point), and the subsequent upbringing of the newborn Yatima within Konishi polis. Yatima matures within a few real-time days, because citizens&#x27; subjective time runs about 800 times as rapidly as flesher and gleisner time. Early on, Yatima and a friend, Inoshiro, use abandoned gleisner bodies to visit a Bridger colony near the ruins of Atlanta on Earth.

Years later, the gleisner Karpal, using a gravitational-wave detector, determines that a binary neutron star system in the constellation of Lacerta has collapsed, releasing a huge burst of energy. Previous predictions portrayed the system&#x27;s stable orbit as likely to last for another seven million years. By analysing irregularities in the orbit, Karpal discovers that the devastating burst of energy will reach Earth within the next four days. Yatima and Inoshiro return to Earth to urge the fleshers—gathered in a conference—either to migrate to the polises or at least to shelter themselves. Many fleshers reject this advice, or fail fully to appreciate its urgency quickly enough. Stirred up by a paranoid Static diplomat, many fleshers suspect that Yatima and Inoshiro have come to trick or coerce them into &quot;Introdus&quot;, or mass-migration into the polises, involving masses of virus-sized nanomachines that dismantle a human body and record the brain&#x27;s information states as it is chemically converted into a crystalline computer. The gamma ray burst reaches Earth shortly after the conference, destroying the atmosphere and causing a mass extinction. The gleisners and the Coalition of Polises survive the burst, thanks to cosmic radiation hardening. Over the next few years, Yatima and other citizens and gleisners attempt to rescue any surviving fleshers from slow suffocation, starvation, or poisoning by offering to upload them into the polises.

The novel&#x27;s title itself refers to a quest undertaken by most of the inhabitants of Carter-Zimmerman (&quot;C-Z&quot;), a polis devoted to physics and understanding the cosmos, along with volunteers from throughout the Coalition of Polises. The Diaspora consists of a collection of one thousand clones (physical copies of the polis hardware) of C-Z polis, deployed toward stars in all directions in the hope of gathering as much data as possible in order to revise the long-held classical understanding of Kozuch Theory, which had failed to predict the Lacerta event. The bulk of the novel follows this expedition, rotating back and forth between different cloned instances of the same cast of main characters as different C-Z clones make discoveries along the way, relaying information to one another over hundreds of light years—and finally between several universes.

==Characters==

* Yatima appears as an Orphan, a personality formed by the Konishi polis &quot;conceptory&quot; rather than by a parent or parents. A central character in the novel, ve usually takes the iconic form of an African herdsman in a purple robe. Yatima exhibits a deep love of mathematics and a desire to explore the unknown.
* Blanca also inhabits the Konishi polis, and is one of the first three people that Yatima meets. Ve is a physicist and scape-architect, acknowledged throughout the Coalition of Polises as an expert on Kozuch Theory. Vis usual icon is a featureless black silhouette.
* Inoshiro, another of Yatima&#x27;s earliest friends, is a native of Konishi but a frequent visitor to Ashton-Laval, a polis of great artistic merit. Ve proudly considers delinquent. Inoshiro frequently attempts to attract Yatima away from philosophical Konishi and into more aesthetic and &quot;avant-garde&quot; pursuits. Inoshiro originates the idea of visiting the fleshers of Atlanta in ancient gleisner bodies. Later, traumatized by the deaths of most of the fleshers in the Lacerta Event, ve adopts a new outlook (a preprogrammed set of self-reinforcing beliefs installed directly into a citizen’s mind) that makes ver no longer care about the physical world. Yatima discovers this and attempts to convince Inoshiro to accompany ver in emigrating to Carter-Zimmerman polis where tangible bodies are the norm, but this outlook has made Inoshiro unwilling to do so. Before and after the Lacerta Event, vis icon has pewter-grey metallic skin.
* Gabriel, Yatima&#x27;s third early friend, is Blanca&#x27;s lover and another great physicist. He differs from most polis citizens in having chosen for himself a specific (though non-functional) gender, a trait considered eccentric and perhaps perverted by many citizens of the Coalition. His icon is covered in short golden-brown fur.
* Karpal, a gleisner astronomer who lives on the surface of the Moon, first discovers the collapse of Lac G-1 in Lacerta. He later leaves his robotic body and gleisner society to transmigrate to the Carter-Zimmerman polis, seeking a more profound understanding of physics, unavailable to creatures whose minds remain programmed to think of things in terms of their bodies.
* Orlando Venetti is originally a leader of the Bridger colony of Atlanta; he and his mate Liana Zabini first welcome Inoshiro and Yatima upon their arrival in gleisner form. In the Lacerta Event, Liana dies but the visitors from Konishi rescue Orlando and bring him into the polis. He joins the Diaspora and, thanks to his Bridger training, he makes the first interactive contact with an alien intelligence. Before joining the Diaspora he creates a son, Paolo, who ultimately joins Yatima in exploring higher-dimensional spacetime on the trail of the &quot;Transmuters&quot;.
* Radiya is Yatima&#x27;s first mentor in abstract mathematics and in exploration of the &quot;Truth Mines&quot;, Konishi’s metaphoric representation of the world of mathematical theorems. Vis icon is a fleshless skeleton made of twigs and branches, with a skull carved from a knotted stump.
* Hermann is a member of the original 21st-century Introdus, who joins the Diaspora. Ve describes as vis own great-great-grandchild because ve has reinvented vis own personality so many times during vis long life. Vis eccentricity is reflected in vis icon, a segmented worm with six flesher-shaped feet attached to elbow-jointed legs, based on the &quot;curl-up&quot; from the work of M. C. Escher. 
* The Star Puppies, a group of Carter-Zimmerman citizens, elect to stay conscious, in real time, for the duration of their spaceflight in the Diaspora (most others enter a state of suspension). The Puppies take the form of space-evolved creatures dwelling in a scape representing the hull of the spacecraft, employing personality &quot;outlooks&quot; (software which accentuates specific moods and values) to ensure they feel constant joy in, and at, the universe around them and retain their sanity.

==The polises==
Humanity began transferring itself into the polises (the &quot;Introdus&quot;) in the late 21st century UT, when the technology became feasible to effect the nanoscale transmutation of human brains into functionally indistinguishable molecular computer systems.

Many polises exist, though the novel mentions only a few. Though their physical infrastructure is not described, they apparently are hardware-based supercomputers of varying size (one of the full C-Z polis clones is briefly mentioned as roughly ten centimeters long) and unknown computational ability, all probably hidden in safe places. Konishi polis, at least, lies buried deep beneath the Siberian tundra, and is multiply backed up throughout the solar system.

Each polis has a distinct character, encapsulated in a &quot;charter&quot; which defines its goals, philosophies, and attitudes to other polises and to the external world. Citizens are expected to heed the charter of the polis they &quot;live&quot; in; should they begin to disagree with the charter, they can always migrate to a polis which appears more amenable to them.

The most prominent differences between the various polises, at least in the novel, involves their attitudes toward the physical world. Polis societies range from those who wish to experience the real world of normal time and space to the wholly solipsistic who live their entire lives in esoteric, isolated virtuality.

The citizens of Konishi polis seem to concern themselves mostly with abstract mathematics and esoteric philosophical pursuits, and generally show little interest in the physical world. They use visual icons for social purposes, but regard simulated physical interaction as a violation of individual autonomy.

After the Lacerta Event, Yatima emigrates from Konishi to Carter-Zimmerman polis, which rejects the solipsism exemplified by Konishi and embraces the study of the physical universe as of paramount importance. Given the Lacerta Event, which suggests that the universe has the capability of unleashing unknown extreme dangers, Yatima has begun to share this viewpoint.

==Polis time, delta, and perception==

For internal dating and time standards the polises use CST (Coalition Standard Time), measured in &quot;tau&quot; elapsed since the adoption of the system on January 1, 2065 (UT). The novel begins at CST date &quot;23 387 025 000 000&quot;. CST defines one tau as the amount of time in which a polis citizen can experience the passage of one second of &quot;subjective&quot; time; this elastic value changes with improvements in polis hardware. In the period of the novel a polis citizen&#x27;s mind can operate at a maximum speed of about 800 times that of a flesher&#x27;s mind, so 1 tau equals approximately 1.25 millisecond. By the beginning of the novel, the Coalition of Polises has existed for over 741 subjective millennia (during 910 years of flesher time), of which about 98.3% has occurred since the last major Coalition-wide polis hardware upgrade in UT 2750.

Nothing compels citizens to experience time at such a high rate; they can equally choose to &quot;rush&quot;, meaning to experience consciousness at a speed slower than the maximum the polis hardware can maintain. Citizens can therefore experience consciousness at the same speed as a human flesher would, or slower, or even freeze their conscious state for a set time or until a previously determined event occurs. Citizens in Lokhande Polis have opted to experience consciousness so slowly that they can witness continental drift and geological erosion.

The polises measure distance, an arbitrary value within their virtual &quot;scapes&quot;, in &quot;delta&quot;, which Egan does not fully explain, although the glossary indicates that citizens&#x27; icons are generally about 2 delta high, implying that one delta represents (roughly) one meter. Delta may also be fractionalised, and there is no largest or smallest distance as defined in delta.

Almost all polis citizens, except for those who specifically elect otherwise, experience the world through two sensory modalities: &quot;Linear&quot; and &quot;Gestalt&quot;, which Egan describes as distant descendants of hearing and seeing, respectively. Linear conveys information quantitatively, as a string or strings of information formulated with a &quot;language&quot; hardwired into the mind of almost all Citizens. Citizens may &quot;speak&quot; to one another in Linear by sending streams of data back and forth, from mind to mind — either private conversations carried on between a specific subset of intended participants, or public announcements accessible to all involved in a conversation or otherwise &quot;listening in&quot;.

Gestalt conveys information qualitatively, and data sent or received about anything arrives all at once for interpretation by the mind of the Citizen in all its aspects simultaneously, resulting in an experience of immediacy. A citizen need not consciously consider the information sent (as in Linear): Gestalt operates rather entirely or almost entirely subconsciously. Citizens use Gestalt to create &quot;icons&quot; for themselves — &quot;visual&quot; representations within Scapes (Gestalt &quot;areas&quot; or &quot;spaces&quot;). Citizens also use Gestalt to convey &quot;Tags&quot;: packages of information described as like an odour or essence, which any other Citizens within a range of several delta (or who happen to &quot;read&quot; for specific Tags) can gather. Each Citizen has a unique Tag which identifies them as a particular person, regardless of their other appearances, and citizens may emit Tags for other purposes as well, as when Citizens need to convey and understand arbitrary information instantly. Early in the novel, for instance, Yatima learns about an asteroid in the real world by reading its tags subconsciously, which precisely inform ver about its properties such as mass, velocity, rotation, composition, emission spectra, and other such data discernible to the Coalition&#x27;s satellite network. Later on Earth, however, when ve and Inoshiro inhabit derelict Gleisner bodies, Yatima must remind that Fleshers are real people, even though they lack tags identifying themselves as such.

<text>Beauxbatons Academy of Magic is a French magic school in the fictional universe of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; created by the British author J. K. Rowling. &quot;Beauxbatons&quot; () translates from French as &quot;beautiful sticks&quot;.

== Description ==
In the fourth book of the series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2000), students from Beauxbatons arrive at Hogwarts to take part in the Triwizard Tournament. They arrive in a carriage, brought by winged Palomino horses.

Beauxbatons is described as a boarding school located in the Pyrenees mountains of southern France full of ice sculptures and forest nymphs.

Beauxbatons has a preponderance of French students, though Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Luxembourgers and Belgians also attend in large numbers.

The delegation is led by headmistress Madame Olympe Maxime, a half-giantess; despite her proportions, she is beautiful, graceful, and well-dressed. Also singled out is Fleur Delacour, the Beauxbatons champion in the Triwizard Tournament, a beautiful girl with silvery hair who is a quarter-veela.

== Students ==
Students of Beauxbatons are described rather stereotypically, mainly as beautiful long-haired girls and attractive boys, in contrast with the serious and surly students from the Eastern European school Durmstrang. They have good manners and in general are positive, while the unpleasant appearance of Durmstrang students implies their dishonesty. Similarly, the carriage of the Beauxbatons is well-lit and nice, while the ship, by which the students of Durmstrang arrive, is gloomy.

They speak French and stereotypical, heavily accented English. Jean-François Ménard, the translator of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; into French, wrote Madame Maxime as arrogant with very correct, aristocratic speech, while Fleur&#x27;s tone was more distrustful. Ménard made these choices because &quot;you cannot write French with a French accent&quot;.

In the screen adaptation &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, Beauxbatons students are all female and Durmstrang students are all male, in contrast to the books which portray both schools as co-educational.

== Criticism ==
The portrayal of the two foreign schools has been criticized as stereotypical. On the whole, the students of Beauxbatons, just as the students of Durmstrang, are homogeneous, not showing the cultural diversity of Hogwarts.

The contrast between Durmstrang and Hogwarts can be interpreted as an allusion to the war of the West with the bad from the East, as described in the gothic fiction of the nineteenth century, and contrast between Beauxbatons and Hogwarts as an allusion to the competition between the reasonable and decent Great Britain and the licentious and decadent France. It has been argued that the appearance on the foreground of these old conflicts allows J K. Rowling to sublimate them, and to make them irrelevant to modern readers.

The three different magic schools have also been interpreted as representing the Allies in World War II, with Beauxbatons standing in for France, in opposition to &quot;Voldemort and his followers represent[ing] Germany&quot;.

<text>Schild&#x27;s Ladder is a 2002 science fiction novel by Australian author Greg Egan. The book derives its name from Schild&#x27;s ladder, a construction in differential geometry, devised by the mathematician and physicist Alfred Schild.

==Plot summary==
Twenty thousand years in the future, Cass, a humanoid physicist from Earth, travels to an orbital station in the vicinity of the star Mimosa, and begins a series of experiments to test the extremities of the &quot;Sarumpaet rules&quot;—a set of fundamental equations in &quot;Quantum Graph Theory&quot;, which holds that physical existence can be precisely modelled by complex constructions of mathematical graphs. However, the experiments unexpectedly create a bubble of something more stable than ordinary vacuum, dubbed &quot;novo-vacuum&quot;, that expands outward at half the speed of light as ordinary vacuum collapses to this new state at the border, hinting at more general laws beyond the Sarumpaet rules. The local population is forced to flee to ever more distant star systems to escape the steadily approaching border, but since the expansion never slows, it is just a matter of time before the novo-vacuum encompasses any given region within the Local Group. Two factions develop as the bubble expands: the Preservationists, who wish to stop the expansion and preserve the Milky Way at any cost; and the Yielders, who consider the novo-vacuum to be too important a discovery to destroy without understanding.

Six hundred years after the initial experiment, a vessel called the &quot;Rindler&quot; matches velocities with an ever-expanding novo-vacuum region at the border, powered by multispectral light emitted as the ordinary vacuum collapses into its lower energy-state. A variety of refugees probe the novo-vacuum in order to understand the physics that makes it possible. The novo-vacuum turns out to be more complicated than anyone had suspected, with a whole ordered universe existing within the zone of apparent chaos as direct elaborations of the quantum graph&#x27;s lattice structure, of which elementary particles, fundamental interactions, and regular spacetime itself are only special cases.

The novo-vacuum&#x27;s exotic geometry is ultimately revealed to contain living organisms and even civilizations, with an ecosystem based on &quot;vendeks&quot;, microbe-like complexes of quantum graph structures only 10−33 meters across. Agglomerations of vendeks form &quot;xennobes&quot;, analogous to multicellular organisms but only 10−27 meters across. This discovery greatly increases the importance of the Yielders&#x27; mission, since destroying the novo-vacuum would be tantamount to genocide, and a solution must be found to the metastability of the novo-vacuum&#x27;s border region within spacetime.

== Background ==
Quantum Graph Theory (QGT) is a fictional improvement of the real theory of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), with quantum graphs in the former being fictional improvements of spin networks in the latter. In 2000, Egan published the essay &quot;Only Connect&quot; describing how the Javanese mathematician Kusnanto Sarumpaet had shown it to unify General relativity and the Standard Model in six papers from 2035 to 2038 and how computer simulations in 2043 and the Orbital Accelerator Facility in 2049 had experimentally verified his work. In 2002, Egan co-authored two papers about Riemannian 10j symbols, spin networks appearing in Riemannian quantum gravity, together with John Baez and Dan Christensen.
