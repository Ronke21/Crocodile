<text>Drew University is a private university in Madison, New Jersey, United States. It has a wooded campus. As of fall 2020, more than 2,200 students were pursuing degrees at the university&#x27;s three schools. While affiliated with the Methodist faith, Drew University does not impose any religious requirements on its students.
==History==
===19th century===

In 1866, Daniel Drew approached church leaders during the Methodist Centenary Celebration with an offer to build, equip, and endow a theological seminary near New York City. Drew asked that his pastor, John McClintock, be appointed to lead the seminary as its first president. Instruction began under the direction of McClintock as both president and professor of practical theology after the first students were admitted in 1867. Drew is the third-oldest of thirteen Methodist seminaries affiliated with the United Methodist Church.

Drew offered professional training for candidates to the ministry augmented by &quot;an opportunity for a broad culture through the study of the humanities.&quot; 

The seminary attracted a faculty that made influential contributions to Methodist theology and biblical scholarship, including James Strong, a professor of exegetical theology, who collaborated with McClintock on the ten-volume &quot;Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature&quot; (1867–1881), and researched, compiled, and published &quot;Strong&#x27;s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible&quot; (1890) during his tenure at the seminary. Writings on early church theology and Christian practice were translated into Chinese for use by foreign missions.

===20th century===

Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, Drew Theological Seminary educated and trained hundreds of Methodist ministers. It began to expand its role with the addition of a course of study for women in 1920 when it established a &quot;College of Missions.&quot; This course would be renamed the &quot;College of Religious Education and Missions&quot; in 1929 but was short-lived.

In 1928, Drew Theological Seminary accepted a gift of $1.5 million from brothers Arthur J. Baldwin and Leonard D. Baldwin to establish an undergraduate liberal arts college. 

The Baldwins were successful attorneys who were raised on a farm in Cortland, New York. Both brothers attended Cornell University. They established a law firm with former New Jersey governor John Griggs spanning &quot;varied interests in lumbering, manufacturing, transportation, and other enterprises that ranged from owning the Grosvenor Hotel in New York City to Arthur&#x27;s legal counseling for the rising McGraw-Hill publishing empire.&quot; The Baldwins became acquainted with the seminary&#x27;s president, Ezra Squier Tipple, who &quot;welcomed the brothers to his prominent New York City Methodist Church when they came to Manhattan.&quot; Leonard Baldwin eventually became a trustee of the seminary in 1919. The donation originally consisted of $500,000 to build a college building, and $1,000,000 in the form of Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company (A&amp;P) stock. However, the Baldwins exchanged the stock with a gift of cash in October 1928.

In their modesty and in recognition of their sibling affection, the Baldwins asked that it be named &quot;Brothers College.&quot; The theological seminary then changed its name to &quot;Drew University&quot; to reflect its expanded role. Brothers College, later renamed as the &quot;College of Liberal Arts&quot;, opened in September 1928 with its first class of 12 students. Brothers College would incorporate the women&#x27;s program and become coeducational in 1942 during World War II when school officials recognized that the military draft and war effort would reduce the all-male student body. Drew offered admission to United States Navy personnel through the V-12 Navy College Training Program. Drew was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the program which offered students a path to a naval officers&#x27; commission.

In 1912, Drew began offering graduate-level education. The university expanded its graduate education programs, focusing on religious studies and establishing the Graduate School, a third of Drew&#x27;s degree-granting entities, in 1955, under the leadership of the university&#x27;s seventh president, Fred Holloway. Holloway also delivered on goals set during previous administrations, overseeing the renovation and rebuilding of the Drew campus, including the Baldwin Gymnasium and several dormitories. Four years later, it would expand the curriculum into other areas of the humanities. The Graduate School was renamed as the &quot;Caspersen School of Graduate Studies&quot; after a pledge of $5,000,000 in 1999 by financier Finn M. W. Caspersen and his wife (and Drew alumna) Barbara Morris Caspersen.

With financial assistance from the Mellon Foundation, the college established a freshman seminar program during the 1970s, which allows first-year students to participate, with faculty who also serve as their academic advisers, in intensive study of a topic of hopefully mutual interest. Interdisciplinary study became a focus of the curriculum, with the creation of majors in neuroscience and minors in such fields as American studies and museology, dance, and writing.

In 1984, psychology professors Philip Jensen and Richard Detweiler led an effort to provide a personal computer and application software to all incoming freshman, a program referred to as the &quot;Computer Initiative&quot;. Drew was the first liberal arts college to have such a requirement. The Computer Initiative differentiated Drew from other liberal arts colleges, and continued until 2012, by which time most entering students had their own computers or wished to select their own model.
After serving two terms as New Jersey&#x27;s 48th governor, Thomas Kean was appointed as Drew&#x27;s tenth president in 1990. He served for 15 years before retiring in 2005. As president, Kean raised Drew&#x27;s profile, overseeing fundraising efforts that tripled the size of the university&#x27;s endowment, adding new faculty in African, Asian, Russian, and Middle Eastern studies, significantly increased opportunities for students to study abroad, increased applications from prospective students, and committed more than $60 million to construction of new buildings and renovation of older buildings—principally student residence halls.

===21st century===
After Kean&#x27;s retirement, the trustees selected Robert Weisbuch, former president of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, as Drew&#x27;s eleventh president in 2005. He served for seven years, and stepped down in June 2012. Under Weisbuch&#x27;s direction, Drew became SAT-optional. From 2006 to 2013, applicants were allowed to submit a graded high school essay instead of SAT or ACT scores. 

In 2013, the university reinstated the SAT (or ACT) as an admission requirement, and changed course two years later in 2015, making it optional once again.

MaryAnn Baenninger became the president of Drew University in July 2014 after serving 10 years as the president of the College of Saint Benedict. She succeeded Vivian A. Bull, a former economics professor and associate dean of the college at Drew and former president of Linfield College, who served as Drew&#x27;s interim president from 2012 to 2014.

In 2015, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was shared by William Campbell, a research fellow at Drew University, for his work developing a drug that treats parasitic diseases.

Undergraduate tuition, room and board for the 2017–2018 academic year was $62,000 (excluding books, personal expenditures, and health insurance), making Drew among the most expensive private universities in New Jersey. In September 2017, the school announced that it was cutting the list price of its tuition for the 2018–2019 school year by 20%, from $48,300 to $36,600, as part of an effort to make the school more appealing to prospective students who had been deterred by the sticker price, which had been one of the state&#x27;s highest.

In May 2020, the university&#x27;s board of trustees announced that President Baenninger would step down at the conclusion of her contract on July 31, 2020. In July, the school&#x27;s search committee announced the appointment of Thomas J. Schwarz as interim president, beginning on August 1, 2020. Schwarz had previously served as president of Purchase College, SUNY, from 2002 to 2019 and was named President Emeritus of Purchase College shortly following his retirement. On February 8, 2023 the University announced the appointment of its fifteenth president, Hilary L. Link, former president of Allegheny College.

== Campus ==
Drew University is located in Madison, New Jersey, a borough approximately west of New York City. Known as &quot;the Rose City&quot; because of its rose-cultivating industry in the 19th century, Madison is an affluent commuter town in New Jersey&#x27;s Morris County. It is connected with the northern section of the state and Midtown Manhattan through the NJ Transit&#x27;s Morris &amp; Essex Lines. The university hosts the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey, an independent professional theatre company.

The university sits on the former estate of William Gibbons, who owned the New York–New Jersey steamboat business that became famous from the &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot; case, and who pieced together a estate in Madison, New Jersey in 1832. He named his holdings &quot;The Forest,&quot; which gives Drew its nickname of the &quot;University in the Forest&quot;.

The following year, Gibbons commissioned the design and construction of a Greek revival antebellum-style residence that was completed in 1836.

In 1867, financier and railroad tycoon Daniel Drew purchased Gibbons&#x27; estate from his descendants for $140,000. A devout Methodist, Drew donated the estate to the church to establish a Methodist theological seminary. The estate&#x27;s mansion would be renamed Mead Hall in honor of Drew&#x27;s wife, Roxanna Mead.

Drew&#x27;s academic buildings feature a mix of Greek Revival, Collegiate Gothic, and neoclassical architecture on a campus that is a serene, wooded oasis in the middle of a bustling suburban town. The campus features the Drew Forest Preserve, an expanse that was recently restored with the planting of 1,100 native trees and shrubs by the university community and volunteer assistance from pharmaceutical manufacturer Pfizer, a large and local employer, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the New Jersey Audubon Society. The university&#x27;s campus also features the Florence and Robert Zuck Arboretum, named for two botany faculty members, containing a mixture of native and non-native trees, plants and two small glacial ponds supporting populations of turtles, goldfish, catfish, and muskrats, and various species of birds including migratory fowl such as Canada geese, ducks, and herons.

The preserve and arboretum both provide a natural laboratory for the instruction of students in the study of biology and life sciences and for research, but is also open to the public by appointment. According to the New Jersey chapter of the Audubon Society, the arboretum and forest preserve is &quot;important for groundwater recharge and runoff reduction within the Passaic River watershed and the Buried Valley Aquifer System&quot;.

===In popular culture===
In films, the Drew University campus appears in &quot;So Fine&quot; (1981), &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997), &quot;The Family Stone&quot; (2005), &quot;Spinning into Butter&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (2008)

In television, Drew University features prominently in Season 1, Episode 5 of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, titled &quot;College&quot;, which initially aired on February 7, 1999. In the episode, Drew&#x27;s Mead Hall appears, substituting for Bates College, Colby College, and Bowdoin College in Maine. In an episode of the NBC series &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;, which aired November 19, 2008, several Drew University campus locations appear, including Asbury Hall and S.W. Bowne Hall.

=== Graduate programs ===
Graduate education has taken place at Drew University since 1912. Initially, graduate education was limited to theology and was conducted through the Theological School. In 1955, the Graduate School was established to take responsibility for the academic (i.e., non-ministerial) study of religion at the graduate level and allow for the development of new graduate programs. In 1999, in exchange for a private donation made by Barbara and Finn Caspersen, the school was renamed the Caspersen School of Graduate Studies.

In 2006, the Graduate Division of Religion, which includes programs in biblical studies and early Christianity, historical studies, religion &amp; society, and theological &amp; philosophical studies, was moved from the Graduate School to the Theological School. The transition was made to reflect current trends in the academic study of religion. In 2006, the school created a Master of Arts in Teaching program, In recent years, the school has also added Master of Education, Master of Finance, and data analytics degrees.

 the Graduate School offered 10-degree programs, including an earned Doctor of Letters degree. In February 2022, it was announced that the university would halt admissions to their PhD program in History &amp; Culture.

=== Theological degree programs ===

Drew Theological School admitted its first students in 1867. Until the 1950s, the school was known as the Drew Theological Seminary, and most students sought a Bachelor of Divinity (B.Div.) degree, which was considered the standard for becoming a minister in an established church. Occasionally, the seminary did issue other degrees, such a Master of Arts (MA) or a Doctor of Theology (Th.D.) to students engaged in the graduate study of religion. Starting in 1920 women were admitted as students, and most notably Olive Winchester was issued a Doctor of Theology in 1925, and became the first female ordained minister in Great Britain.

The school is often noted for its strong ties to Korean Methodism. The Rev. Henry Appenzeller, a graduate of the Theological School, became the first Christian missionary to Korea. He worked to establish the Korean Methodist Church, schools and universities, and he translated the Bible into Korean. Henry Appenzeller maintained relationships with members of the Drew community following his graduation in the year 1885. As a result of his work and his connection to Drew, in 2016, members of the Chungdong First Methodist Church in Seoul, South Korea, started in 1887 by Appenzeller, visited Drew and donated a bronze bust of their patron, located outside the Theological School building. the Theological School&#x27;s matriculating class includes many students from South Korea.

One of the 13 official seminaries of the United Methodist Church, the Theological School prepares those pursuing ministry in the United Methodist Church. The student body also includes students preparing for ministry in other Christian denominations, and those from other faith communities.

As of 2019, the Theological School offers six different degree programs. In October 2018, the school launched the &quot;Drew Social Justice Leadership Project&quot; which allows students, partners and professors to express their thoughts, and share their experience regarding social justice issues in an accessible way.

=== Rose Memorial Library and Methodist Archives ===
Built in 1938 with funds donated by Lenox S. Rose, the Rose Memorial Library houses the university&#x27;s library collections offering 558,000 bound volumes, more than 378,000 microforms, 10,000 periodical titles in electronic database subscriptions, and about 2,700 periodical subscriptions in paper form. The facility also includes a media resource center and learning center.

Topics include religious materials such as hymnbooks, prayer books, and Bibles, as well as non-religious materials such as witchcraft, literature, graphic novels, and science fiction magazines. Most notably, the collection holds a first edition of the King James Bible.

The library&#x27;s special collections include a collection of books, manuscripts, artifacts and papers of Nebraska-born author Willa Cather (1873–1947). This collection, which is regarded as the best collection of Cather&#x27;s papers assembled in the United States, was given to the university by several donors, including Frederick B. Adams, former director of the Pierpont Morgan Library; Earl and Achsah Brewster, longtime friends of Cather; violinist Yehudi Menuhin; and by Finn and Barbara Caspersen.

<text>Fairleigh Dickinson University () is a private university with its main campuses in New Jersey, located in Madison / Florham Park and in Teaneck / Hackensack. Founded in 1942, Fairleigh Dickinson University offers more than 100 degree programs. In addition to two campuses in New Jersey, the university has a campus in Vancouver, British Columbia, one in Wroxton, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, and an online platform. Fairleigh Dickinson University is New Jersey&#x27;s largest private institution of higher education, with over 12,000 students.

==History==
Fairleigh Dickinson University was founded as the Fairleigh Dickinson Junior College in 1942 as a junior college by Peter Sammartino and wife Sally, and was named after early benefactor Colonel Fairleigh S. Dickinson, co-founder of Becton Dickinson. Its original campus was located in Rutherford, New Jersey. By 1948, Fairleigh Dickinson Junior College expanded its curriculum to offer a four-year program when the GI Bill and veterans&#x27; money encouraged it to redesignate itself as Fairleigh Dickinson College. In that same year, the school received accreditation from the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.

In 1953, Fairleigh Dickinson College merged with the 400-student Bergen Junior College, acquiring its campus in Teaneck, New Jersey. At the time of the merger, Fairleigh Dickinson had more than 2,800 students and would be able to accommodate a total enrollment of 4,000 with its two campuses.

In 1956, the institution was recognized as Fairleigh Dickinson University by the New Jersey State Board of Education. In 1958, the university acquired the former Twombly-Vanderbilt estate in Madison and Florham Park, New Jersey, to serve as its third campus. Fairleigh Dickinson University is a member of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.

Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park, had designed the landscape for the Twombly-Vanderbilt estate (now the Florham Campus). The main house of the Twombly-Vanderbilt estate, now Hennessy Hall, was designed by architectural firm McKim, Mead, and White in the Georgian Revival style. The mansion was completed in 1897 and was modeled after the wing of Hampton Court Palace designed by architect Sir Christopher Wren. The Friends of Florham, founded in 1990 by Emma Joy Dana, university librarian James Fraser, and a group of friends and colleagues works with the mission of advising and assisting the administration and board of trustees in the care, maintenance, and preservation of the Twombly Estate, known as &quot;Florham&quot;.

===Presidents===

==Campuses==
Fairleigh Dickinson University has four campuses: two in New Jersey (Madison / Florham Park and Teaneck / Hackensack), one in Vancouver, British Columbia, and one in South East England, as well as an online platform.

===Florham Campus===
The Florham Campus is located in the suburban towns of Madison and Florham Park, New Jersey, on the grounds of the former Florham estate of Hamilton McKown Twombly (1849–1910) and his wife, Florence Adele Vanderbilt Twombly (1854–1952), a member of the wealthy Vanderbilt family.

The Florham Campus finished construction on the John and Joan Monninger Center for Learning and Research. It opened during the spring 2013 semester. Student enrollment at the Florham Campus consists of over 2,757 undergraduates coupled with 690 graduate students giving a total of 3,417 students. The full-time equivalence (FTE) for undergraduates on the campus is 2,481. The FTE for graduates on campus is 796.

===Metropolitan Campus===
The Metropolitan Campus, close to New York City and spanning the Hackensack River in Teaneck and Hackensack, New Jersey, has a greater focus on business and professional majors compared to the Florham Campus. The Metropolitan Campus has 5,734 undergraduates and 1,748 graduate students, with an undergraduate full-time equivalence (FTE) of 3,003. 21% of Metropolitan Campus students are minority and international students. Approximately one thousand students live on campus in the residence halls.

===Wroxton College===

Farleigh Dickinson University&#x27;s Wroxton College is located in Wroxton, Oxfordshire, in South East England. When Fairleigh Dickinson University acquired Wroxton Abbey in 1965, FDU became the first American university to own and operate a campus, Wroxton College, outside of the United States. Although Wroxton College dates to the 18th century, the housing has been modernized.

===Vancouver Campus===
FDU&#x27;s Vancouver Campus is located at 842 Cambie Street and 89 West Georgia Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. It opened in 2007.

===Former campuses===
In addition to the present campuses, Fairleigh Dickinson University previously operated campuses in Rutherford, New Jersey (where the university was founded in 1942) and in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. Operations on the Rutherford Campus were merged with the Metropolitan Campus in 1993. The Rutherford Campus was sold to Felician College in 1997. The West Indies Laboratory which opened in 1972 was damaged beyond repair during Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and was closed shortly afterwards in 1990.

==Academics==
Fairleigh Dickinson&#x27;s national student body consists of a total 10,899 students, 8,461 of whom are undergraduates, with the remaining 2,438 being graduate students with a full-time equivalence (FTE) of 7,434, making it the largest private institution in the state of New Jersey. FDU has over 1,100 international students from approximately 17 countries around the world ranking it 15th nationally among their Carnegie peer group. The majority of international students attend the Metropolitan Campus and FDU&#x27;s Vancouver Campus, which was founded primarily to educate international students. The Vancouver Campus is the first U.S.–owned and operated institution in British Columbia to receive University status.

The university is ranked 44th by U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges 2022 Regional University rankings (North).

Fairleigh Dickinson consists of two academic colleges: the Maxwell Becton College of Arts and Sciences and the Silberman College of Business, along with seven independent schools: the Gildart Hasse School of Computer Sciences and Engineering; the Peter Sammartino School of Education; the International School of Hospitality, Sports, and Tourism Management; the Henry P. Becton School of Nursing and Allied Health; the School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences; the School of Psychology and Counseling; and the School of Public and Global Affairs.

=== Becton College of Arts and Sciences ===
Fairleigh Dickinson&#x27;s Becton College offers more than 60 undergraduate majors to its full and part-time students.

=== Silberman College of Business ===
The Silberman College of Business is a tri-campus college of Fairleigh Dickinson University. It offers graduate and undergraduate degrees at the Florham Campus, the Metropolitan campus, and offers bachelor&#x27;s degree studies in Business Management and Information Technology at the FDU-Vancouver campus.

FDU offers AACSB-accredited graduate and undergraduate business degrees through its Silberman College of Business. Fairleigh Dickinson&#x27;s Silberman College of Business was ranked as one of the top 295 business schools in the country for 2014 by The Princeton Review.

Fairleigh Dickinson University&#x27;s International School of Hospitality and Tourism Management features the US national headquarters of the international gastronomic society Confrérie de la Chaîne des Rôtisseurs located at the Chaîne House on the Florham Campus.

===Graduate studies===
Graduate programs are offered at all four of the university&#x27;s campuses, and a number are offered solely through online delivery, including a postdoctoral MS in clinical psychopharmacology (MSCP) through the School of Psychology and Counseling. Graduate studies include the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) offered by the School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in clinical psychology, the Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) in school psychology, and a large number of master&#x27;s degree programs, including the Master of Public Administration (MPA) and an MA in global affairs offered to nearby consular and diplomatic staff.

====FDU School of Pharmacy====
In 2012, Fairleigh Dickinson opened New Jersey&#x27;s first school of pharmacy associated with a private higher education institution, at the Florham Campus. It is the second pharmacy school in New Jersey and the first to open in the state in over 120 years.

====FDU School of Public and Global Affairs====
After a major gift from alumnus James Orefice in 2017, Fairleigh Dickinson formed a new graduate School of Public and Global Affairs comprising the Master of Public Administration, the Master of Administrative Science, the M.A. in Global Affairs, the M.S. in Cyber and Homeland Security Administration, the Master of Arts in Higher Education Administration, and the survey research group, PublicMind.

=== FDU Libraries ===
The university maintains libraries on all four of its campuses. Between the two libraries and one archive located at FDU&#x27;s Florham and Metropolitan campuses, the university library system holds over 450,000 titles.

The Florham Campus library is part of the John and Joan Monninger Center for Learning and Research. A portion of the library is housed in the old Orangerie of the Twombly-Vanderbilt estate which was built in the 1890s by McKim, Mead, and White.

The Metropolitan campus features the Metropolitan Library and the North Jersey Heritage Center (an archival collection of New Jersey books, documents, maps, newspapers and reference material, as well as FDU history). The New Jersey collection began in 1961 when FDU became one of the earliest participants in the New Jersey Document Program listed as fourth in precedence out of 80 depositories behind the Council of State Government, Rutgers University and the NJ State Library. The Metropolitan Library holds the Columbia Pictures Archive, a collection of over 230 movies from the Columbia Pictures Studios on 16mm film. The archive was given by Columbia in the 1980s to FDU through the work of Jack Kells, FDU alum and former Columbia executive.

==Athletics==

In intercollegiate athletics, the Metropolitan Campus competes in NCAA Division I, while the Florham Campus competes in Division III, making it one of only a few schools in the United States to field both Division I and Division III teams. The teams at the Metropolitan Campus are known as the Knights, while the Florham Campus teams are known as the Devils.

On March 17, 2023, the Fairleigh Dickinson University men&#x27;s basketball team became the second team in history to upset a 1 seed as a 16 seed against Purdue in the 2023 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

===Florham Campus – NCAA Division III===

<text>The Strait of Canso (also Gut of Canso or Canso Strait, also called Straits of Canceau or Canseaux until the early 20th century) separates mainland Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island, in eastern Canada.

It is a channel approximately 27 kilometers long and averaging 3 kilometers wide (1 km at its narrowest). The strait connects Chedabucto Bay on the Atlantic Ocean to St. George&#x27;s Bay on the Northumberland Strait, a subbasin of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

The strait is (200+ feet) deep, with two significant communities at Port Hawkesbury on the eastern side facing Mulgrave on the western side, both ports. The strait is crossed by the Canso Causeway for vehicular and rail traffic, opened in 1955. The Canso Canal allows ships to pass through the causeway, and this can accommodate any vessel capable of transiting the St. Lawrence Seaway.

An account of early settlement in the area is given in the letters of resident Henry Nicholas Paint (1830–1921), Member of Parliament for Richmond county and merchant, whose father Nicholas secured valuable land grants and settled in a stone-built house at Belle Vue in 1817. Port Hawkesbury, at first known as Ship Harbour, emerged as a shipbuilding and boatbuilding port on the Strait in the 19th century with firms such as H.W. Embree and Sons producing distinctive fishing boats that came to be known as &quot;Canso Boats&quot; after the Strait.

<doc id="295144" wikidata="Q1573001" url="?curid=295144" title="Preppy">
<text>Preppy (also spelled as preppie), or prep, is an American subculture associated with the alumni of college-preparatory schools in the Northeastern United States. The term, which is an abbreviation of &quot;preparatory&quot;, is used to denote a person seen as characteristic of a student or alumnus of these schools. Characteristics of preppy individuals include a particular subcultural speech, vocabulary, dress, mannerisms and etiquette reflective of an upper class and old money upbringing.

== Definition ==

The term &quot;preppy&quot; derives from the private college-preparatory schools that some American upper class and upper middle class children attend. The term &quot;preppy&quot; is commonly associated with the Ivy League and broader group of oldest universities in the Northeast as well as the prep schools which brought students to them, since traditionally a primary goal in attending a prep school was admittance into one of these institutions. Preppy fashion derives from the fashions of these old Northeastern schools in the early to mid-twentieth century.

Lisa Birnbach&#x27;s 1980 book &quot;The Official Preppy Handbook&quot; was written to poke fun at the rich lives of privileged Ivy League and socially elite liberal arts college students. It portrays the preppy social group as well-connected, and although exclusive, courteous to other social groups without fostering serious relationships with them. Being educated and well-connected is associated with an upper-class socioeconomic status that emphasizes higher education and high-income professional success.

== Fashion ==
For men, preppy fashion has its roots in, and substantially overlaps with, the &quot;Ivy&quot; style of dress, which originated in the early 1900&#x27;s and had become widespread by the late 1950s. The &quot;Ivy&quot; style took its name from Ivy League universities where it originated. J. Press represented the quintessential purveyor of Ivy League style. In the mid-twentieth century, J. Press and Brooks Brothers both had stores on Ivy League school campuses, including Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, Yale, and Penn.

Ivy Style was inspired by leisure activities commonly enjoyed by the upper-classes in the United Kingdom and northeastern United States (such as polo, sailing, hunting, fencing, crew rowing, lacrosse, golf, tennis, rugby, squash, and swimming) and adapted the sportswear associated with these activities as everyday wear. As such, it incorporated aspects of traditional British country clothing (tweed sport coat, brogue shoes, etc.). Distinctly preppy fashions then emerged as a still-more-casual, youthful interpretation of Ivy League style (rugby shirt, boat shoes, etc.). Thus, the sportswear, casual lifestyle apparel, and outdoor gear offered by retailers such as L.L. Bean in the Northeast (with its eponymous &quot;Bean Boots&quot;) and Eddie Bauer in the Pacific Northwest came to form an important component of preppy style. Both outfitters, along with Vermont-based Orvis, were featured in &quot;The Official Preppy Handbook&quot;. The mostly tongue-in-cheek guide published in 1980 described L. L. Bean as &quot;nothing less than Prep mecca.&quot; Their catalog was said to be &quot;the biggest seller of the rugged New England Prep look.&quot;

By the 1980s, mass marketing of brands such as Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, Daniel Cremieux, and Izod brought a resurgence of Ivy and preppy styles and moved them into the mainstream.

For women, preppy-influenced fashions emerged in the 1960s, a trend led by designers such as Perry Ellis and Lilly Pulitzer, influenced by designers such as Oleg Cassini, and popularized by female students at the Seven Sisters Colleges, sister institutions to the Ivy League. These classic ensembles of the 1960s and 1970s include tailored skirt suits, low heels, wrap dresses, shift dresses, silk or cotton blouses, and jewelry with a refined style. Such clothing often includes elements drawn from typical preppy styles, such as nautical stripes, pastel colours, or equestrian details.

&quot;The Official Preppy Handbook&quot; points to daughters &quot;borrowing the clothes her mother wore in Prep school. Before long, they share a charge account at The Talbots.&quot; The handbook also stated that &quot;Behind the red door on every Talbots catalog cover is the best selection of women&#x27;s Prep fashions anywhere.&quot; And that &quot;the clothes here are a rare combination of Preppy, tasteful, and sophisticated.&quot;

Though traditional interest in the preppy style generally fell in the 1990s, some of the newer outfitters such as Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, Tommy Hilfiger, Vineyard Vines, Gant, and Elizabeth McKay are often perceived as having preppy styles, with designers such as Marc Jacobs and Luella Bartley adding the preppy style into their clothes in the 1990s.

Examples of preppy wardrobe staples include:
* Navy blazers with brass buttons
* Repp stripe and silk knit neckties
* Sweaters (as opposed to sweatshirts, windbreakers, etc.), particularly those with cable knitting, argyle patterns, or a university name/logo
* Grosgrain (&quot;ribbon&quot;), surcingle, or woven leather belts
* Seersucker and madras cloth 
* Chino cloth, Corduroy trousers or go-to-hell pants
* casual Button down shirts
* Loafers (particularly penny loafers)
* Derby shoes made of buckskin
* Polo shirts and rugby shirts
* Boat shoes and other moccasin-style shoes

<doc id="295148" wikidata="Q28337" url="?curid=295148" title="Shoal">
<text>In oceanography, geomorphology, and geoscience, a shoal is a natural submerged ridge, bank, or bar that consists of, or is covered by, sand or other unconsolidated material, and rises from the bed of a body of water close to the surface or above it, which poses a danger to navigation. Shoals are also known as sandbanks, sandbars, or gravelbars. Two or more shoals that are either separated by shared troughs or interconnected by past or present sedimentary and hydrographic processes are referred to as a shoal complex.

The term &quot;shoal&quot; is also used in a number of ways that can be either similar to, or quite different from, how it is used in geologic, geomorphic, and oceanographic literature. Sometimes, the term refers to either any relatively shallow place in a stream, lake, sea, or other body of water; a rocky area on the seafloor within an area mapped for navigation purposes; or a growth of vegetation on the bottom of a deep lake, that occurs at any depth, or is used as a verb for the process of proceeding from a greater to a lesser depth of water.

== Description ==
Shoals are characteristically long and narrow (linear) ridges. They can develop where a stream, river, or ocean current promotes deposition of sediment and granular material, resulting in localized shallowing (shoaling) of the water. Marine shoals also develop either by the in-place drowning of barrier islands as the result of episodic sea level rise or by the erosion and submergence of inactive delta lobes.

Shoals can appear as a coastal landform in the sea, where they are classified as a type of ocean bank, or as fluvial landforms in rivers, streams, and lakes.

A shoal–sandbar may seasonally separate a smaller body of water from the sea, such as:
* Marine lagoons
* Brackish water estuaries
* Freshwater seasonal stream and river mouths and deltas.

The term &quot;bar&quot; can apply to landform features spanning a considerable range in size, from a length of a few meters in a small stream to marine depositions stretching for hundreds of kilometers along a coastline, often called barrier islands.

=== Composition ===
They are typically composed of sand, although they could be of any granular matter that the moving water has access to and is capable of shifting around (for example, soil, silt, gravel, cobble, shingle, or even boulders). The grain size of the material comprising a bar is related to the size of the waves or the strength of the currents moving the material, but the availability of material to be worked by waves and currents is also important.

== Formation ==
Wave shoaling is the process when surface waves move towards shallow water, such as a beach, they slow down, their wave height increases and the distance between waves decreases. This behavior is called &quot;shoaling&quot;, and the waves are said to shoal. The waves may or may not build to the point where they break, depending on how large they were to begin with, and how steep the slope of the beach is. In particular, waves shoal as they pass over submerged sandbanks or reefs. This can be treacherous for boats and ships.

Shoaling can also refract waves, so the waves change direction. For example, if waves pass over a sloping bank which is shallower at one end than the other, then the shoaling effect will result in the waves slowing more at the shallow end. Thus, the wave fronts will refract, changing direction like light passing through a prism. Refraction also occurs as waves move towards a beach if the waves come in at an angle to the beach, or if the beach slopes more gradually at one end than the other.

===Types===
====Sandbars and longshore bars====

Sandbars, also known as a trough bars, form where the waves are breaking, because the breaking waves set up a shoreward current with a compensating counter-current along the bottom. Sometimes this occurs seaward of a trough (marine landform).

Sand carried by the offshore moving bottom current is deposited where the current reaches the wave break. Other longshore bars may lie further offshore, representing the break point of even larger waves, or the break point at low tide.

====Peresyp====

In Russian tradition of geomorphology, a &quot;peresyp&quot; is a sandbar that rises above the water level (like a spit) and separates a liman or a lagoon from the sea. Unlike tombolo bars, a &quot;peresyp&quot; seldom forms a contiguous strip and usually has one or several channels that connect the liman and the sea.

====Harbor and river bars====

A harbor or river bar is a sedimentary deposit formed at a harbor entrance or river mouth by the deposition of freshwater sediment or by the action of waves on the sea floor or on up-current beaches.

Where beaches are suitably mobile, or the river&#x27;s suspended or bed loads are large enough, deposition can build up a sandbar that completely blocks a river mouth and dams the river. It can be a seasonally natural process of aquatic ecology, causing the formation of estuaries and wetlands in the lower course of the river. This situation will persist until the bar is eroded by the sea, or the dammed river develops sufficient head to break through the bar.

The formation of harbor bars that prevent access for boats and shipping can be the result of:
* construction up-coast or at the harbor — e.g.: breakwaters, dune habitat destruction.
* upriver development — e.g.: dams and reservoirs, riparian zone destruction, river bank alterations, river adjacent agricultural land practices, water diversions.
* watershed erosion from habitat alterations — e.g.: deforestation, wildfires, grading for development.
* artificially created/deepened harbors that require periodic dredging maintenance.

=====Nautical navigation=====
In a nautical sense, a &quot;bar&quot; is a shoal, similar to a reef: a shallow formation of (usually) sand that is a navigation or grounding hazard, with a depth of water of or less. It therefore applies to a silt accumulation that shallows the entrance to or course of a river, or creek. A bar can form a dangerous obstacle to shipping, preventing access to the river or harbor in poor weather conditions or at some states of the tide.

==Geological units==

In addition to longshore bars discussed above that are relatively small features of a beach, the term &quot;shoal&quot; can be applied to larger geological units that form off a coastline as part of the process of coastal erosion, such as spits and baymouth bars that form across the front of embayments and rias. A tombolo is a bar that forms an isthmus between an island or offshore rock and a mainland shore.

In places of reentrance along a coastline (such as inlets, coves, rias, and bays), sediments carried by a longshore current will fall out where the current dissipates, forming a spit. An area of water isolated behind a large bar is called a lagoon. Over time, lagoons may silt up, becoming salt marshes.

In some cases, shoals may be precursors to beach expansion and dunes formation, providing a source of windblown sediment to augment such beach or dunes landforms.

==Human habitation==
Since prehistoric times, humans have chosen some shoals as a site of habitation. In some early cases, the locations provided easy access to exploit marine resources. In modern times, these sites are sometimes chosen for the water amenity or view, but many such locations are prone to storm damage.

An area in Northwest Alabama is commonly referred to as &quot;The Shoals&quot; by local inhabitants, and one of the cities, Muscle Shoals, is named for such landform and its abundance of Mussels.

<text>Miami University (informally Miami of Ohio or simply Miami) is a public research university in Oxford, Ohio, United States. Founded in 1809, it is the second-oldest university in Ohio and the tenth-oldest public university in the United States. The university enrolls 18,600 students in Oxford and maintains regional campuses in nearby Hamilton, Middletown, and West Chester. Miami also operates the international Dolibois European Center in Differdange, Luxembourg.

Miami University provides a liberal arts education; it offers more than 120 undergraduate degree programs and over 70 graduate degree programs within its seven schools and colleges in architecture, business, engineering, humanities and the sciences. It is a member of the University System of Ohio. Miami was one of the original eight Public Ivy schools, a group of publicly funded universities considered as providing a quality of education comparable to those of the Ivy League. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

Miami University has a long tradition of Greek life; five social Greek-letter organizations were founded at the university, earning Miami the nickname &quot;Mother of Fraternities&quot;. Today, approximately one-third of the undergraduate student population are members of the Greek community. Miami&#x27;s athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I and are collectively known as the Miami RedHawks. They compete in the Mid-American Conference in all varsity sports except ice hockey, which competes in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference.

==History==
===Old Miami (1809–1873)===
The foundations for Miami University were first laid by signed by President George Washington, stating an academy should be Northwest of the Ohio River in the Miami Valley. The land was within the Symmes Purchase; Judge John Cleves Symmes, the land&#x27;s owner, purchased it from the government with the stipulation that he set aside land for an academy. Congress granted one township to be in the District of Cincinnati to the Ohio General Assembly for the purposes of building a college, two days after Ohio was granted statehood in 1803. The Ohio Legislature selected a township off Four Mile Creek for it. The Legislature passed &quot;An Act to Establish the Miami University&quot; on February 2, 1809, and the state created a board of trustees. The township originally granted to the university was known as College Township, and was renamed Oxford, Ohio, in 1810.

The university temporarily halted construction due to the War of 1812. Cincinnati tried—and failed—to move Miami to the city in 1822 and to divert its income to a Cincinnati college. Miami created a grammar school in 1818 to teach frontier youth, but it was disbanded after five years. Though financed by means of a government land grant, Miami University initially was inaugurated and operated by Presbyterians, with explicit legislative encouragement for religious education having been enshrined in the Northwest Ordinance. Robert Hamilton Bishop, a Presbyterian minister and professor of history, was appointed to be the first President of Miami University in 1824, stating in his inaugural speech that all teaching at Miami University should be based in the Bible.

The first day of classes at Miami was on November 1, 1824. At its opening, there were 20 students and two faculty members in addition to Bishop. The curriculum included Greek, Latin, algebra, geography, and Roman history; the university offered only a Bachelor of Arts. An &quot;English Scientific Department&quot; was started in 1825, which studied modern languages, applied mathematics, and political economy. It offered a certificate upon completion of coursework, not a diploma. The school provided public prayers twice a day and required all students to partake in a public worship every Sunday.

Miami students purchased a printing press, and in 1827 published their first periodical, &quot;The Literary Focus&quot;. It promptly failed, but it laid the foundation for the weekly &quot;Literary Register&quot;. &quot;The Miami Student&quot;, founded in 1867, traces its foundation back to the &quot;Literary Register&quot; and claims to be the oldest college newspaper in the United States. A theological department and a farmer&#x27;s college were formed in 1829; the farmer&#x27;s college was not an agricultural school, but a three-year education program for farm boys. William Holmes McGuffey joined the faculty in 1826, and began his work on the &quot;McGuffey Readers&quot; while in Oxford. By 1834 the faculty had grown to seven professors and enrollment was at 234 students. Eleven students were expelled in 1835, including one for firing a pistol at another student. McGuffey resigned and became president of Cincinnati College, where he urged parents not to send their children to Miami.

Alpha Delta Phi opened its chapter at Miami in 1833, making it the first fraternity chapter west of the Allegheny Mountains. In 1839, Beta Theta Pi was created; it was the first fraternity formed at Miami.

In 1839 Old Miami reached its enrollment peak, with 250 students from 13 states; only Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth were larger. President Bishop was forced to resign by the board of trustees in 1840, due to the failure of his appeals for unity in face of the Old School–New School controversy, which had caused factions to rise against each other trying to take over the university&#x27;s administration. Old School adherents won out by focussing on his anti-slavery beliefs, lenient disciplinary methods, and an agreement he had struck with the New School Lane Seminary, allowing students of both institutions to learn at the other. He was replaced as president by George Junkin, former President of Lafayette College, a strict Old School adherent with strong anti-Methodist and pro-slavery views; Junkin resigned in 1844, having proved to be unpopular with students. By 1847, enrollment had fallen to 137 students.

Students in 1848 participated in the &quot;Snowball Rebellion&quot;. Defying the faculty&#x27;s stance against fraternities, students packed Old Main, one of Miami&#x27;s main classrooms and administrative buildings, with snow and reinforced the snow with chairs, benches and desks from the classroom. Those who had participated in the rebellion were expelled from the school and Miami&#x27;s student population was more than halved. By 1873, enrollment fell further to 87 students. The board of trustees closed the school in 1873, and leased the campus for a grammar school. The period before its closing is referred to as &quot;Old Miami.&quot;

===New Miami (1885–present)===
The university reopened in 1885, having paid all of its debts and repaired many of its buildings; there were 40 students in its first year. Enrollment remained under 100 students throughout the 1800s. Miami focused on aspects outside of the classics, including botany, physics, and geology departments. With its reopening a change in religious policy occurred, the school no longer required faculty to be ordained Presbyterian ministers. In 1888, Miami began inter-collegiate football play in a game against the University of Cincinnati. By the early 1900s, the state of Ohio pledged regular financial support for Miami University. Enrollment reached 207 students in 1902. The Ohio General Assembly passed the Sesse Bill in 1902, which mandated coeducation for all Ohio public schools. Miami lacked the rooms to fit all of the students expected the next year, and Miami made an arrangement with Oxford College, a women&#x27;s college in the town, to rent rooms. In the same year David McDill became Miami&#x27;s first non-Presbyterian president, stressing its non-denominational, but Christian nature during his inauguration. By 1905 faculty personnel belonging to Presbyterian churches constituted 13 out of 27 positions, still a relative but no longer an absolute majority.

In 1902, the Ohio legislature also authorized the establishment of the Ohio State Normal School &quot;to provide proper theoretical and practical training for all students desiring to prepare themselves for the work of teaching.&quot; The normal school was Miami&#x27;s first professional college and would evolve into the College of Education, Health, and Society. Miami&#x27;s first African-American student, Nelly Craig, graduated from the Ohio State Normal School in 1905. Hepburn Hall, built in 1905, was the first women&#x27;s dorm at the college. By 1907, the enrollment at the university passed 700 students and women made up about a third of the student body. Andrew Carnegie pledged $40,000 to help build a new library for the university. The McGuffey Laboratory School opened in 1910 and was soon housed with the teacher preparation students in the new McGuffey Hall, completed in 1917 and named to honor former professor William Holmes McGuffey.

Enrollment in 1923 was at 1,500 students. In 1928, Miami founded the School of Business Administration and acquired the Oxford College for Women. The next year, the School of Fine Arts was established. By the early 1930s, enrollment had reached 2,200 students. The conservative environment found on campus called for little change during the problems of the Great Depression, and only about 10 percent of students in the 1930s were on government subsidies. During World War II, Miami changed its curriculum to include &quot;war emergency courses&quot; and a Navy Training School took up residence on campus. During wartime in 1943, the population of the university consisted of a majority of women. Due to the G.I. Bill, enrollment at Miami jumped from 2,200 to 4,100 students. By 1952, the student body had grown to 5,000.

In 1954, Miami created a common curriculum for all students to complete to have a base for their other subjects. By 1964, enrollment reached nearly 15,000. To accommodate the growing number of students, Miami University opened its first regional campuses at Middletown, Ohio, in 1966 and Hamilton, Ohio, in 1968. Miami founded the Dolibois European Center in Luxembourg in 1968, which would move to Differdange Castle in 1997; it is home to a study abroad program where students live with Luxembourgish host families and study under Miami professors.

On April 15, 1970, a student sit-in at Rowan Hall, home of Miami&#x27;s Naval ROTC program, in opposition to the Vietnam War resulted in 176 students being arrested. Edgar W. King Library was completed in 1972. In 1974, the Western College for Women in Oxford was sold to Miami, and President Phillip Shriver oversaw the creation of an interdisciplinary studies college known as the Western College Program.

Responding to the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, trustees changed the athletic teams nickname from the &quot;Redskins&quot; to the &quot;RedHawks&quot; in 1997. The School of Engineering and Applied Science was created in 1999. In 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring Miami University for its 200th anniversary. In the same year, a new Farmer School of Business building was completed on the East Quad, and the Miami University Voice of America Learning Center opened in West Chester, Ohio. In 2014, the Armstrong Student Center was completed to replace the Shriver Center, which was repurposed. All campuses were closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, reopening partially that fall. Miami established the Honors College, its first residential college, the following year. The Clinical Health Sciences and Wellness Facility opened in 2023 to combine clinical and academic health departments and services. The McVey Data Science building opened in 2024, funded by alumnus Richard McVey to house departments in computer science, statistics and analytics.

==Campuses==

===Oxford===
Miami University&#x27;s main campus is in Oxford, Ohio; the city is in the Miami Valley in southwestern Ohio about northwest of Cincinnati and southwest of Dayton. Oxford is a college town, with over 70% of the residents attending college or graduate school.

Development of the campus began in 1818 with a multipurpose building called Franklin Hall; Elliott Hall, built in 1825, is Miami&#x27;s oldest standing building and residence hall. Miami is renowned for its campus beauty, having been called &quot;The most beautiful campus that ever there was&quot; by Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Robert Frost, a friend of then Miami artist-in-residence Percy MacKaye. Miami&#x27;s campus buildings are predominantly built in the style of Georgian Revival architecture, most of which are built &quot;to human scale&quot; at three stories or less. The area of Miami&#x27;s Oxford campus consists of 2,138 acres (8 km2).

There are four museums on campus, including the Richard and Carole Cocks Art Museum, William Holmes McGuffey Museum, and the Karl Limper Geology Museum.

====Academic buildings====
The original portion of campus starts at the intersection of South Campus Avenue and East High Street, where the Phi Delta Theta Gates lead into the slant walk path. In this area are the oldest academic buildings, including Hall Auditorium and McGuffey Hall, built in 1909, and Alumni Hall, built in 1910. Harrison Hall and King Library are also in this area. Going eastward along East Spring Street are Irvin Hall and Kreger Hall before the Armstrong Student Center, the largest building on campus. Surrounding Bishop Woods are Hughes Laboratories, Laws Hall, Shideler Hall, and Upham Hall.

Buildings north of East High Street begin at the McVey Data Science Building on Tallawanda Road. Going eastward is the campus of the College of Engineering and Computing, which includes Benton Hall and Garland Hall/Engineering Building. Clustered around North Patterson Avenue are Pearson Hall, the Psychology Building, and the Farmer School of Business. The Farmer School of Business is housed in a building designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects of New York City and Moody Nolan of Columbus which was the first building on the Oxford campus to receive a LEED certification.

There are four streets south of East Spring Street with academic buildings. On South Campus Avenue is the Clinical Health Sciences and Wellness Facility. On Oak Street are Williams Hall and Phillips Hall; in between Spring and Maple Street is McMillan Hall; and between Maple and South Patterson Avenue are the Shriver Center, Hiestand Hall and Art Building, and the Center for Performing Arts. Also along Patterson Avenue is Bachelor Hall before the entrance to Western Campus, which includes Boyd Hall, Hoyt Hall, Peabody Hall, and Presser Hall.

====Historic landmarks====

* The Dewitt Log Homestead was built in 1805 and is the oldest extant structure in Oxford Township.
* Elliott and Stoddard Halls, built in 1825 and 1836, are the oldest buildings on campus.
* Langstroth Cottage is a National Historic Landmark built in 1856. It was the home of L. L. Langstroth who conducted research and breeding of honey bees.

* The former Oxford Female Institute in uptown Oxford served as a university dorm until 2001 and has since been leased as the Oxford Community Arts Center.
* The Western Female Seminary Historic District denotes the Romanesque and Colonial Revival architecture of the former Western College campus. The Western Campus was also home to the orientation sessions for the volunteers of Freedom Summer in June 1964, a significant campaign of the civil rights movement.

===Dolibois European Center===
The John E. Dolibois European Center in Differdange, Luxembourg, serves as a study abroad campus for students and houses about 125 students per semester. It offers continuing classes pertaining to students&#x27; studies, typically in architecture, business, French, German, history, and political science. Students live in homestays with Luxembourgish host families and are encouraged to travel in Europe through university-led study programs and in their free time. It was established in 1968 and named after Miami alumnus John E. Dolibois, former United States Ambassador to Luxembourg.

===Regional campuses===
Miami University has three satellite campuses. Miami University Middletown, located in Middletown, Ohio, was founded in 1966 as Ohio&#x27;s first regional campus. Miami University Hamilton, located in Hamilton, Ohio, was established in 1968, and the Miami University Voice of America Learning Center, located in West Chester, Ohio, was established in 2009 to house the Farmer School of Business MBA program.

Miami&#x27;s regional campuses are non-residential and offer a handful of bachelor&#x27;s degrees, associate degrees, one certificate program, as well as beginning course work for most four-year degrees, and the MBA and MEd programs at Oxford. Combined, Miami&#x27;s regional campuses enroll 4,664 students. Middletown and Hamilton compete in independent sports as members of the Ohio Regional Campus Conference, competing under the monikers &quot;Middletown ThunderHawks&quot; and &quot;Hamilton Harriers&quot;.

==Organization and administration==

*College of Liberal Arts and Applied Science (Miami Regionals)

As a public university, Miami is part of the University System of Ohio. It is governed by a board of trustees which oversees the administration of the university and holds subcommittees on investment, finance and audit, and academic and student affairs. This includes oversight on programs offered by the university and financial expenditures. The board has 17 members, nine of which are voting members appointed by the governor of Ohio. Six are university alumni who reside outside of Ohio, while the remaining two are enrolled students of the university.

The office of the president manages Miami University&#x27;s fiscal and business operations, supporting the academic and research missions across all campuses. The office works with the board of trustees to set the vision, direction, and priorities of the university, in addition to serving as a university figurehead and liaison. The 22nd and current president is Dr. Gregory P. Crawford, who entered the role in 2016. Crawford previously served as vice president and associate provost at the University of Notre Dame.

Other administrative departments include that of the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, which includes the deans of each of the eight academic colleges and the Dolibois European Center. The Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Services and Treasurer&#x27;s department oversees university finances, procurement, and audits. The office of the Vice President for Student Life, Senior Vice President for University Advancement, Vice President for Information Technology, and Senior Vice President for Enrollment Management round out the university&#x27;s administrative faculty.

As of the end of fiscal year 2023, Miami University&#x27;s financial endowment was $739 million.

==Academics==

Miami University is a large, primarily residential teaching university with a focus on undergraduate studies. The university offers more than 100 majors, 48 minors, and 11 co-majors. In the 2022–2023 academic year, the most popular majors were finance, marketing, psychology, computer science, and biology.

Miami offers master&#x27;s degrees in more than 50 areas of study and doctoral degrees in 12, the largest of which are doctoral degrees in psychology. To enroll in graduate courses, students must first be accepted into the Graduate School, and then into the department through which the degree is offered. Although tuition for the Graduate School is roughly the same as for an undergraduate degree, most of the graduate programs offer graduate assistantships as well as tuition waivers.

As of 2024, Miami&#x27;s annual tuition was $18,162 for Ohio residents and $40,822 for out-of-state residents. Its in-state tuition rate is the highest of all public universities within the University System of Ohio.

===Undergraduate admissions===
Miami University extends offers of admission to applicants after holistic review that includes examination of academic rigor and performance, admissions test scores, personal essays, and recommendations. Admission to Miami University is classified as &quot;more selective&quot; by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The Princeton Review gives Miami University an &quot;Admissions Selectivity Rating&quot; of 88 out of 99.

===Curriculum===

The College of Arts and Science is the oldest and largest college at Miami, with almost half of the undergraduate student body enrollment. It offers 70 majors covering a broad range of areas of study across the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences, as well as pre-law, pre-medical and interdisciplinarity programs. The curriculum emphasizes creativity, research, and global perspectives. 10 of the 12 doctoral degrees offered by Miami are provided through the College of Arts and Science.

Miami&#x27;s Farmer School of Business is a nationally recognized school of business that offers nine majors. The school also offers graduate MBA, accountancy, and economics degrees.

Miami&#x27;s College of Creative Arts offers 14 majors through its five departments: architecture and interior design, art, emerging technology in business &amp; design, Music, and Theatre. Each department has its own portfolio or audition admission requirements, which are separate from the standard admissions requirements for the university. Art and music majors choose concentrations within their programs.

The College of Education, Health &amp; Society offers 20 undergraduate majors spanning six departments, which include educational leadership, educational psychology, family science and social work, kinesiology and health, sports leadership and management, and teacher education. As of fall 2009, nearly 3,500 full-time and part-time undergraduates were enrolled in the school.

The school also offers four master&#x27;s degrees in computer science, chemical engineering, computational electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering.

The Miami University Honors College was established in 2021, replacing the former university honors program on campus. Around 400 students are admitted to the Honors College every year and are required to produce publishable research. Based in Peabody Hall on the Western Campus, the Honors College is Miami&#x27;s only residential college and fosters one-on-one interaction with faculty-in-residence.

===Libraries and publications===
Edgar W. King Library is the primary academic library at Miami. It opened as an undergraduate library when the south section was completed in 1966; it became the main library when the north section was completed in 1972. King Library is home to Miami University Libraries’ humanities, government, law, and social sciences collections as well as the Walter Havighurst special collections and university archives. It additionally houses King Café, centers for academic writing, information management and digital scholarship, and a library makerspace.

In addition to King Library, the university&#x27;s library system also includes the Wertz Art &amp; Architecture Library in Alumni Hall, the Rentschler Library at Miami University Hamilton and the Gardner-Harvey Library at Miami University Middletown.

==Student life==

===Student body===

As of 2020, Miami University has a total enrollment of 22,971 admitted students. The Oxford campus encompasses 18,669 students, of which 16,522 are at the undergraduate and 2,147 at the graduates and professional. Within offers for admission in fall 2021, 44% of students were from Ohio, with offers for students from all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and 122 countries abroad. Miami University encompasses 1,614 international students from 67 countries. Of the regularly enrolled international students, the most represented countries are typically China, Vietnam, India, Nepal, and South Korea. With a gender distribution of 49% male students and 51% female students, Miami University&#x27;s gender disparity between men and women is far below the national average, making it one of the most equally balanced undergraduate institutions in the United States.

===Student organizations===

For the 2017–18 academic year, Miami had over 600 registered student organizations. These clubs and organizations run the gamut from varsity sports clubs to professional fraternities, from political and religious groups to fashion, theatre and LGBTQ+ organizations. The university recognizes the Associated Student Government (ASG) that represents student interests to faculty, administrators, and the Ohio Legislature. It is the official student government of Miami University. It has an executive branch chaired by the student body president with 13 members who work with administrators in all areas of student life as well as academics and a legislative branch made up of 50 senators who voice student concerns, write and vote on legislation on a weekly basis.

The Miami University Marching Band is the largest student organization on campus, typically fielding around 250 to 275 students. It represents the college at all home football games, as well as at various away games, bowl games, parades, and marching band festivals.

====Mock trial====
Miami University participates in the American Mock Trial Association and has won two National Championship Tournament titles, with the most recent in 2018, where Miami beat Yale University in the final round. The school has made 17 top-ten finishes. In the 2019 season, Miami sent two teams to the National Championship Tournament. Miami A earned twelve ballots in their division, just one ballot short of division champions Yale A. Miami earned honorable mentions in 2021 and 2022. In 2023, Miami failed to earn a bid to the NCT. This marked the end of the longest-running NCT streak in the American Mock Trial Association; Miami had not missed an NCT since at least 2005.

Miami has sent two competitors to Trial by Combat, a one-on-one competition for outstanding AMTA competitors.

====Media organizations====
Miami has a variety of media outlets. The student-run newspaper, &quot;The Miami Student&quot;, claims to have been founded in 1826, which would make it the oldest university newspaper in the United States. However, the first issue is dated May 1867, and the paper refers to itself as &quot;the oldest college newspaper west of the Alleghenies.&quot; The Miami Student Magazine is a sister publication to the newspaper. The bi-annual publication includes feature writing and short stories. The undergraduate literature and art magazine, &quot;Inklings&quot;, is available in print and online. RedHawk Radio (WMSR) is Miami&#x27;s only student radio station. Miami University Television (MUTV) is available on cable in Oxford, Ohio. &quot;UP Magazine&quot; is Miami&#x27;s student-run fashion magazine that publishes an issue each semester and also maintains a blog.

====Miami University Men&#x27;s Glee Club====

Aside from the university&#x27;s student newspaper, the university&#x27;s oldest and longest-running academic student organization is the Miami University Men&#x27;s Glee Club. Founded in 1907 by professor Raymond H. Burke, composer of Miami&#x27;s fight song and alma mater, the glee club is among the oldest and largest groups of its kind in the nation. Its roughly 80 singers are selected by audition and perform on campus and around the world.

The Glee Club has performed with major symphony orchestras, among them the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. Throughout its history, the Glee Club has worked with renowned composers, conductors and singers such as Morten Lauridsen, Martina Arroyo, Max Rudolf, Thomas Schippers, Paul Salamunovich, A.R. Rahman, and most recently Italian tenor Alessandro Brustenghi. In 2014, the Glee Club performed a Memorial Day service at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, as part of its biannual international tour, and later won the First European Prize with Great Distinction at the Concours Europeen de Chant Choral 2014 (European Choir Competition).

The Glee Club also hosts one men&#x27;s a cappella singing group, The Cheezies.

===Residential life===
Miami University requires first and second-year students to live on campus. Elliott and Stoddard Halls, built in 1828 and 1835 respectively, are used as dormitories. They are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The campus has a total of 46 residence halls, the newest of which opened in 2018. The residence halls are organized into eight quads throughout campus.

Residence halls have representatives that participate collectively in the Residence Hall Association and the student senate.

===Greek life===

Miami has a long tradition of Greek life, beginning in 1832 with the founding of the Miami chapter of Alpha Delta Phi. Miami is nicknamed the Mother of Fraternities for the number of fraternities that started on its campus, including three known as the Miami Triad: Beta Theta Pi (1839), Phi Delta Theta (1848), and Sigma Chi (1855). Other Greek organizations founded at Miami include Phi Kappa Tau (1906) and Delta Zeta (1902).

As of the fall of 2017, there were 2,556 sorority members and 1,544 fraternity members. Miami hosts about 50 different fraternities and sororities governed by three different student governing councils. In 2004, Miami University&#x27;s office of Greek affairs was endowed with a $1 million gift from alumnus Cliff Alexander, a member of Sigma Nu.

In the 2017 fall semester, the Greek community recorded 11,847 service hours and raised $96,839 for philanthropic causes. The university has suspended various chapters of Greek organizations for disorderly conduct, hazing, and alcohol violations.

===Traditions===

The university&#x27;s student body has two notable superstitions. Stepping on the large copper replica of the university&#x27;s seal by Upham Hall is believed to bring bad results for a student&#x27;s exams; inversely, it is considered good luck to rub the heads of the copper turtles supporting the Delta Delta Delta sundial before exams.

When two students meet at Miami, enter into a relationship, and then get married, they are called &quot;Miami Mergers&quot;. Couples are encouraged to register with the university&#x27;s alumni association, which has sent Miami Mergers an annual Valentine&#x27;s Day card since 1973. In 2022, 14,406 Miami Merger couples received a Valentine&#x27;s Day card from the association. Another campus superstition is that couples who kiss under the arch of Upham Hall at midnight will become Miami Mergers.

Green Beer Day is an unofficial day-long party near the Miami University campus where celebrants drink green-dyed beer on the Thursday before Miami&#x27;s spring break. It was established in the early 1980s by local bar owners. Green Beer Day has been called one of the university&#x27;s &quot;biggest traditions&quot;, although it is not sanctioned by the university, which has worked to combat binge drinking in preparation for the event.

==Athletics==

Miami&#x27;s National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I sports teams are called the RedHawks; the program offers 18 varsity sports for men and women. They compete in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) in all varsity sports except ice hockey, which competes in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference. Miami&#x27;s athletic teams had several names before 1928, when Miami Publicity Director R.J. McGinnis coined the nickname &quot;Redskins&quot;. In 1996, the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, which works with the university on Native American relations, withdrew its support for the nickname. The board of trustees voted to change the nickname to the RedHawks in 1997. The current athletic director is David Sayler, who was hired to the position in December 2012.

Miami is nicknamed the &quot;Cradle of Coaches&quot; for the coaches that have trained through the Miami RedHawks football program, including College Football Hall of Fame inductees Paul Brown, Carmen Cozza, Weeb Ewbank, Ara Parseghian, Earl Blaik, Woody Hayes, Bo Schembechler, and Jim Tressel. Two former players, John Harbaugh and Sean McVay, coached their respective teams to victories in Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl LVI, with McVay becoming the youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl at age 36. Former Miami quarterback Ben Roethlisberger became a two-time Super Bowl winning quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Miami&#x27;s football team plays in Yager Stadium; they formerly played in the now demolished Miami Field. The current head coach is Chuck Martin, who was named head coach on December 3, 2013. The RedHawks compete each year against the Cincinnati Bearcats for the Victory Bell, a tradition that dates back to 1888. The Battle of the Bricks is also played annually against the Ohio Bobcats. The RedHawks are 8–7 all-time in bowl games and have secured 23 conference titles as of the 2023 season.

The Miami RedHawks men&#x27;s basketball team has appeared in 17 NCAA basketball championship tournaments, reaching the Sweet Sixteen four times, most recently in 1999. Notable former student-athletes have included Randy Ayers, Ron Harper, Wally Szczerbiak, and Wayne Embry. The team competes in Millett Hall and is coached by Travis Steele.

Miami RedHawks men&#x27;s ice hockey team started in 1978 coached by Steve Cady. The RedHawks made the NCAA national title game in 2009, but lost in overtime to the Boston University Terriers after leading much of the game. They have made 12 appearances in the NCAA tournament. The men&#x27;s ice hockey team plays at the Goggin Ice Center as part of the National Collegiate Hockey Conference.

The Miami University Synchronized Skating Team team began in August 1977 as a &quot;Precision Skating Club&quot; at Goggin Ice Center. The program achieved varsity status by 1996. The Miami University senior synchronized skating team are the 1999, 2006, and 2009 U.S. national champions. Miami won a silver medal at the 2007 World Championships, the first medal ever won by Team USA for synchronized skating. The collegiate-level team has won 18 national titles; Miami created a junior-varsity level team beneath the senior level.

At one time Miami had a competitive wrestling program, but eliminated the wrestling program, along with men&#x27;s golf and tennis, in 1999 to better comply with Title IX regulations. Several members of the cut teams sued the university president, athletic director, and board of trustees, alleging that the removal of the teams violated their Fourteenth Amendment and Title IX protections. Enlisting the help of the Center for Individual Rights, the students took their case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, where a district judge denied their claims. The students appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, where two judges affirmed the district court&#x27;s ruling.

==Alumni==

<text>(Latin for &quot;On the Manner of Proceeding in Cases of the Crime of Solicitation&quot;) is the title of a 1962 document (&quot;instruction&quot;) of the Holy Office codifying procedures to be followed in cases of priests or bishops of the Catholic Church accused of having used the sacrament of Penance to make sexual advances to penitents. It repeated, with additions, the contents of an identically named instruction issued in 1922 by the same office.

The 1962 document, approved by Pope John XXIII and signed by Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, Secretary of the Holy Office, was addressed to &quot;all Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops and other Local Ordinaries, including those of Eastern Rite&quot;. It was an internal document for use by the Curia, describing how the rules in the &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;: on dealing with such cases, were to be implemented, and directed that the same procedures be used when dealing with denunciations of homosexual, paedophile or zoophile behaviour by clerics. Dioceses were to use the instruction for their own guidance and keep it in their archives for confidential documents; they were not to publish the instruction nor produce commentaries on it.

 remained in effect until 18 May 2001, when it was replaced by new norms promulgated by the papal motu proprio &quot;Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela&quot; of 30 April of the same year. Normally it would have ceased to have effect with the entry into force of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, which replaced the 1917 Code on which the 1962 document was based, but it continued in use, with some necessary adaptations, while a review of it was carried out.

==Applicability and scope==
In line with the opening words of the document, 70 of the 74 paragraphs of which it was composed dealt with cases concerning sexual advances during the sacrament of Penance, repeatedly referring to the complainant or injured party as &quot;the penitent&quot; (the person confessing sins); the final four paragraphs laid down that its contents applied also to (the foulest crime), namely a homosexual act, with which were equated, for penal effects, any perpetrated or attempted externally obscene act with pre-adolescent children or brute animals. Charges concerning these crimes also were to be handled according to the norms of the document, even if committed without any connection with Penance.

Media accounts sometimes presented the instruction as not concerned principally with sexual solicitation in Confession, but with denunciations of paedophilia. While it is true that such acts were covered by &quot;&quot;, canon lawyers have argued that the secrecy provisions of the document &quot;would not have tied the hands of a bishop, or anyone else, who wanted to report a crime by a priest to the police&quot;.

==Canon law on cases of solicitation in confession==

The &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; in force when was issued obliged anyone whom a priest solicited in confession to denounce him within one month and ordered that any such priest be subjected to a serious ecclesiastical punishment:

 indicated the procedure to be followed between a denunciation and the possible infliction of a penalty.

== Contents ==
The document&#x27;s title, &quot; (Instruction on procedure in solicitation cases), indicates that it was composed to indicate how to carry out a canonical investigation into accusations of solicitation. It described the procedures to be followed in each phase: reception of a denunciation; the course of the investigation, summoning the accused, sentencing, and the possibility of appeal.

The result of the investigation could vary:
* if the accusation appeared to be unfounded, this was stated in the record and the documents containing the accusation were destroyed;
* if only vague evidence emerged, the case was filed away for use if fresh evidence appeared;
* if the evidence was strong but insufficient for arraigning the accused, he was given an admonition and the records were preserved with a view to any further developments;
* if the evidence was strong enough, the accused person was summoned and a canonical trial took place.

Quoting canon 2368 §1 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law, then in force, &quot;&quot;, 61 indicated the penalties that could be imposed after conviction. These penalties, such as suspension &quot;a divinis&quot;, deprivation of an office or rank, and reduction to the lay state, were of public character, even if the trial itself had been conducted with all due secrecy. The same part of the document laid down that, in addition to those penalties, penances should be imposed on guilty priests, and those in danger of repeating their crime should be subjected to particular vigilance (64).

Except in connection with the sacrament of Penance, canon law imposed no &quot;legal&quot; obligation – though a &quot;moral&quot; one might exist – to denounce clerics guilty of engaging in or attempting a homosexual act; but the procedure described in was to be followed also in dealing with such accusations (71–72). And any gravely sinful external obscene act with prepubescent children of either sex or with animals engaged in or attempted by a cleric was to be treated, for its penal effects, as equivalent to an actual or attempted homosexual act (73).

Unless solicitation in connection with Confession was involved, not only the local bishop but also superiors of religious orders exempt from the jurisdiction of the local bishop could proceed, either by formal trial or non-judicially (&quot;modo administrativo&quot;), against members of those orders who had committed such crimes; superiors of non-exempt religious orders could also do so, but only non-judicially (74).

== Trial confidentiality ==
Since was primarily concerned with offenses committed in the confessional, this &quot;...presented particular problems of investigation, because in most cases the priest could not be interrogated fully without putting the seal of confession in danger.&quot;

Section 11 of outlines the required confidentiality of the investigation into accusations of the crime of solicitation. The document imposed absolute confidentiality on the trial&#x27;s proceedings (explicitly excepting &quot;what may happen to be lawfully published when this process is concluded and put into effect&quot;, the term &quot;published&quot; meaning &quot;publication of the evidence&quot; in Canon Law, or the conclusion of the &quot;discovery phase&quot; in a civil trial, before the verdict is rendered), both during its conduct and after any concluding verdict had been put into effect:

An oath of secrecy was to be taken by all members of the tribunal; violation incurred a penalty of automatic excommunication. The ecclesiastical penalty for violation of secrecy by the accused priest was automatic suspension &quot;a divinis&quot;, although he was free to discuss with his defence counsel (Section 13).

Unless violation of secrecy occurred after an explicit procedural warning given in the course of their examination (Section 13; and cf. Section 23 concerning the person denouncing solicitation: &quot;before the person is dismissed, there should be presented to the person, as above, an oath of observing the secret, threatening the person, if there is a need, with an excommunication reserved to the Ordinary or to the Holy See&quot;), no ecclesiastical penalties were to be imposed on the accusers and witnesses.

The oath of office to be taken by the members of the tribunal was given as Formula A:

Interviewed for a television programme in 2006, canon lawyer Thomas Doyle is quoted as saying that the tight secrecy demanded for the procedure as &quot;an explicit written policy to cover up cases of child sexual abuse by the clergy, to punish those who would call attention to these crimes by churchmen&quot;. However, regarding the programme transcript, the BBC &quot;cannot vouch for its accuracy&quot;. Not long after the broadcast, Doyle said, &quot;Although I was a consultant to the producers of the documentary I am afraid that some of the distinctions I have made about the 1962 document have been lost. I do not believe now nor have I ever believed it to be proof of an explicit conspiracy, in the conventional sense, engineered by top Vatican officials, to cover up cases of clergy sexual abuse.&quot;

In the study of the instruction that he revised less than two years later he stated: &quot;According to the 1922 and 1962 documents, accusers and witnesses are bound by the secrecy obligation during and after the process but certainly not prior to the initiation of the process. There is no basis to assume that the Holy See envisioned this process to be a substitute for any secular legal process, criminal or civil. It is also incorrect to assume, as some have unfortunately done, that these two Vatican documents are proof of a conspiracy to hide sexually abusive priests or to prevent the disclosure of sexual crimes committed by clerics to secular authorities.&quot; He also remarked: &quot;To fully understand the overriding concern for secrecy one must also understand the traditional canonical concept known as the &#x27;Privilege of the Forum&#x27; &quot;privilegium fori&quot; which has its roots in medieval Canon Law. Basically this is a traditional privilege claimed by the institutional church whereby clerics accused of crimes were tried before ecclesiastical courts and not brought before civil or secular courts. Although this privilege is anachronistic in contemporary society, the attitude or mentality which holds clerics accountable only to the institutional church authorities is still active. This does not mean that the official Church believes that clerics accused of crimes should not to be held accountable. It means that during certain periods in history the Church has believed that it alone should have the right to subject accused clerics to a judicial process.&quot;

John L. Allen Jr. has said the secrecy was aimed rather at the protection of all involved, the accused, the victim/denouncer and the witnesses, before the verdict was passed, and for free finding of facts.

==Involvement of the Holy See==
A &quot;New York Times&quot; article published on 1 July 2010 said that the 1962 instruction was a restatement of that of 1922, giving the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office authority to prosecute clergy accused of sexual abuse. According to Canon law expert Nicholas P. Cafardi, the CDF itself didn&#x27;t know it had this power under Ratzinger, until 2001. &quot;From what can be deduced from published reports, there seems to have been a power struggle going on between Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos, prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy and Ratzinger at the CDF over which congregation had competency in the matter of clergy who had sexually abused minors.&quot; At a meeting in Rome in 2000, Archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Wilson, drew Vatican officials&#x27; attention to the long forgotten which gave CDF jurisdiction. Pope John Paul II subsequently issued &quot;Sacramentorum Sanctitatis Tutela&quot; directing that all cases of sexual abuse by priests be handled by the CDF.

 repeated that, under pain of grave sin, any ordinary (bishop or equivalent) who received a denunciation of the crime of solicitation was to inform immediately the Holy See and the ordinary of the place of residence of the accused priest. It was for the ordinary of the place of residence to investigate the charge at the first level (&quot;in prima instantia&quot;); the Holy See reserved to itself the right to intervene at this level only &quot;for particular and grave reasons&quot;.

The defendant did not lose the right that all members of the Church have to ask that their cases, at any level, be submitted to the Holy See; but once the trial had begun, such a recourse did not suspend the jurisdiction of the local judge, unless he learned that the Holy See had actually accepted the recourse. After sentence was passed, the defendant could appeal to the Holy See against it within ten days. If he did, any suspension from hearing confessions or exercising sacred ministry remained in force, but any other penalties imposed on him were suspended, until a decision was made on the appeal. The &quot;promoter of justice&quot; (the official Church prosecutor) could likewise appeal to the Holy See against a verdict in favour of the accused. This constituted an exception to the normal procedure whereby appeals against a first-level sentence are made to a designated second-level tribunal, with the case going to Rome only if the first two tribunals give discordant verdicts.

<text>The twin battles of Jena and Auerstedt (; older spelling: &quot;Auerstädt&quot;) were fought on 14 October 1806 on the plateau west of the river Saale in today&#x27;s Germany, between the forces of Napoleon I of France and Frederick William III of Prussia, at the outset of the War of the Fourth Coalition during the Napoleonic Wars. The defeat suffered by the Prussian Army subjugated the Kingdom of Prussia to the French Empire until the Sixth Coalition was formed in 1813.

Several figures who were later integral to the reformation of the Prussian Army participated at Jena–Auerstedt, including Gebhard von Blücher, Carl von Clausewitz, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, Gerhard von Scharnhorst, and Hermann von Boyen.

==Background==
Following the Prussian declaration of war, Napoleon initiated his campaign against the Fourth Coalition by thrusting a 180,000-strong force through the Franconian Forest. The Prussian army, meanwhile, awaited Napoleon&#x27;s advance with a force composed of about 130,000 Prussians and 20,000 Saxons. In comparison to the modern, tightly organized structure of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, the Prussian command was bloated and inefficient; key roles were divided between multiple officers, creating uncertainty and disagreement in the coordination of field movements. There was also no courier system in place for messages to be transmitted quickly; if orders were changed, precious minutes would then be lost making the arrangements necessary for the changes to be distributed. 

==Overview==
The battles began when elements of Napoleon&#x27;s main force encountered Hohenlohe&#x27;s troops near Jena. Initially 48,000 strong, the Emperor took advantage of his carefully planned and flexible dispositions to rapidly achieve local superiority, with a force reaching 96,000 men. However, less than half fought the Prussians as only 40,000 men were sent and actually took part in the battle. The Prussians, meanwhile, were slow to grasp the situation, and slower still to react. Before Ruchel&#x27;s 15,000 men could arrive from Weimar, Hohenlohe&#x27;s force was routed, with 10,000 killed or wounded and 15,000 captured. Ruchel did eventually bring his troops to the battlefield. Soon after it was committed to battle and Hohenlohe rode up to take personal command of the corps, they were ridden over and sent fleeing to the rear in irretrievable rout, with Ruchel being wounded. Nevertheless, Jena was a fierce battle, with 5,000 French killed, wounded or captured; and Napoleon mistakenly believed that he had faced the main body of the Prussian army.

Further north at Auerstedt, both Davout and Bernadotte received orders to come to Napoleon&#x27;s aid. Davout attempted to comply via Eckartsberga, Bernadotte via Dornburg. Davout&#x27;s route south, however, was blocked by the Prussian main force of 64,000 men, including the Prussian King, the Duke of Brunswick and Field Marshals von Möllendorf and von Kalckreuth. A savage battle ensued. Although outnumbered more than two to one, Davout&#x27;s superbly trained and disciplined III Corps endured repeated attacks before it eventually took the offensive and put the Prussians to flight. Though within earshot of both battles, Marshal Bernadotte controversially took no steps to come to Davout&#x27;s aid, refusing to take the initiative and instead adhering to the last written set of Napoleon&#x27;s orders.

==Battle of Jena==
===Plan===
The Prussian army was divided into three armies drawn from across Prussia. Prussia&#x27;s main weakness in 1806 was its senior command structure, which included command positions being held by multiple officers. One such example is the position of chief of staff, held by three different officers: General Phull, Colonel Gerhard von Scharnhorst and Colonel Rudolf Massenbach. The confusing system led to delays and complexities that resulted in over a month&#x27;s delay before the final order of battle was prepared. Another obstacle facing the Prussians was the creation of a unified plan of battle. Five main plans emerged for discussion; however, protracted planning and deliberating shifted the initiative to the French. Thus, the Prussian plans became mere reactions to Napoleon&#x27;s movements.

Although Prussia had begun its mobilization almost a month before France, Napoleon had kept a high state of readiness after the Russian refusal to accept defeat after the War of the Third Coalition. Napoleon conceived a plan to force Prussia into a decisive battle, like Austerlitz, and pre-empt the Prussian offensive. Napoleon had a major portion of his in position in present-day Baden-Württemberg in southwest Germany and thus decided on a northeast advance into Saxony and on to Berlin.

===Battle of Jena===

The battle commenced on the morning of 14 October 1806, on the grassy fields near Jena. The first movements of the French Army were attacks on either flank of the Prussian lines. That gave the supporting armies (making up the central attack) time to get into position. The skirmishes had little decisive success, save for a breakthrough by the French General Saint-Hilaire, who attacked and isolated the Prussian left flank.

At that time, Marshal Michel Ney had completed his maneuvers and had taken up position as ordered by Napoleon. However, once in position, Ney decided to attack the Prussian line despite having no orders to do so, a move that proved to be almost disastrous. Ney&#x27;s initial assault was a success, but he found himself overextended and under heavy fire from Prussian artillery. Recognizing the distressed salient, the Prussian general ordered a counterattack and enveloped Ney&#x27;s forces; Ney formed them into a square to protect all their flanks. Napoleon recognized Ney&#x27;s situation and ordered Marshal Jean Lannes to shift from the centre of attack to help Ney.

That action left the French centre weak. However, Napoleon deployed the Imperial Guard to hold the French center until Ney could be rescued. That adaptability was one of Napoleon&#x27;s greatest strengths. He kept the Imperial Guard under his direct command and could order them to take positions depending on the situation that the battle presented him. The rescue worked, and Ney&#x27;s units were able to retreat from the battle. Although the French were then in a troubling situation, the Prussian commanders did not take the initiative to push at the French weaknesses. That was later considered to have been their undoing. The inactivity of the Prussian infantry left them open to artillery and light infantry fire. One Prussian general later wrote that &quot;the area around the entrance of the village was the scene of the most terrible blood-letting and slaughter&quot;.

It was at that time, around 1 p.m., that Napoleon decided to make the decisive move. He ordered his flanks to push hard and try to break through the Prussian flanks and encircle the main center army while the French center attempted to crush the Prussian centre. The attacks on the flanks proved to be a success. With its flanks broken, the Prussian army was forced to withdraw and Napoleon had won another battle. In total the Prussian army lost 10,000 men killed or wounded, had 15,000 prisoners of war taken as well as 150 guns.
==Battle of Auerstedt==

General Étienne Gudin&#x27;s Division were on the move from Naumburg before 6:30 a.m. By 7 a.m. the 1st Chasseurs were stopped cold in their tracks outside of Poppel by Prussian cavalry and artillery. There was a heavy fog, which had lifted just as they approached the village. Once Davout became aware of the Prussian force, he ordered Gudin to deploy his force at Hassenhausen.

The Prussian commander on the field was Friedrich Wilhelm Carl von Schmettau. His division was actually under orders to proceed down the very road that Davout was on, to block his advance in the Kösen Pass. While Schmettau&#x27;s troops were deploying to attack Hassenhausen, Blücher arrived with his cavalry and deployed on his left. Together, they attacked Gudin&#x27;s troops and pushed them back to the village.
Wartensleben arrived at 8:30 a.m. with the Duke of Brunswick, who ordered his infantry to the left flank and his cavalry to the right. The rest of the French cavalry arrived at 9 a.m. and was placed on Gudin&#x27;s left. General Louis Friant&#x27;s Division and the 12-pound artillery arrived at 9:30 a.m. and moved in squares on Gudin&#x27;s right. The advance of the French squares forced Blücher&#x27;s cavalry back. Seeing no other option available he ordered his cavalry to attack. At that very moment, two of Wartensleben&#x27;s regiments attacked Hassenhausen.

Everything failed: three Prussian cavalry regiments were routed and the infantry fell back. At this critical point, the Duke needed to take drastic action. Shortly before 10 a.m., he ordered a full assault on Hassenhausen. By 10 a.m., the Duke of Brunswick was carried from the field mortally wounded along with Schmettau who was also badly wounded. With the loss of both commanders, the Prussian command broke down. The Prussian army was in danger of collapse.

Oswald&#x27;s infantry and the Prince of Orange, the later William I of the Netherlands, arrived about 10:30 a.m., and the King made his only decision of the day: to split Orange&#x27;s command in two, half to each flank. On the French side, Morand&#x27;s Division arrived and was sent to secure Gudin&#x27;s left. Davout could now see that the Prussians were wavering and so at 11 a.m. he ordered his infantry to counter-attack. By noon Schmettau&#x27;s center was broken and forced back over the Lissbach Stream, Blücher&#x27;s cavalry was blown, and Wartensleben was trying to reposition his troops. The Prussians realized all was now lost and the King ordered a withdrawal.

Davout&#x27;s corps had lost 7,052 officers and men killed or wounded, while Prussian casualties were 13,000.

==Aftermath==

Napoleon initially did not believe that Davout&#x27;s single Corps had defeated the Prussian main body unaided and responded to the first report by saying &quot;Your Marshal must be seeing double!&quot;, a reference to Davout&#x27;s poor eyesight. As matters became clearer, however, the Emperor was unstinting in his praise. Davout was made Duke of Auerstedt. Lannes, the hero of Jena, was not so honored.

Bernadotte&#x27;s lack of action was controversial within a week of the twin battles. Bernadotte had last received positive written orders on the day before the battle in which his I Corps, along with Davout&#x27;s III Corps, were to lie astride the Prussians&#x27; projected line of retreat. He was the only Marshal not to receive updated, written orders on the night of 13 October. In the early hours of 14 October, Davout received a courier from Berthier in which he wrote: &quot;If the Prince of Ponte Corvo [Bernadotte] is with you, you &quot;may&quot; both march together, but the Emperor hopes that &quot;he will be in the position which had been indicated at Dornburg&quot;.&quot; Davout thence relayed this order to Bernadotte when the next met at 0400 the same morning. Bernadotte later cited the poorly written, equivocal nature of the verbal order, as discretionary and complied with Napoleon&#x27;s wish to be at Dornburg instead of accompanying Davout. Moreover, when told of Davout&#x27;s difficulties, Bernadotte did not believe that the Prussian main force was before III Corps as Napoleon had claimed the main body was at Jena. As a consequence, he failed to aid Davout and instead fulfilled the Emperor&#x27;s orders to position I Corps in the Prussian rear on the Heights of Apolda, which, incidentally, did have the effect intended as the Prussians at Jena withdrew once they saw French troops occupying their line of retreat.

Davout and Bernadotte later became bitter enemies as the result of Bernadotte&#x27;s perceived indifference at the fate of a fellow Marshal. For his part, Napoleon later stated on St. Helena that Bernadotte&#x27;s behavior (though he was complying with Napoleon&#x27;s orders) was disgraceful and that but for his attachment to Bernadotte&#x27;s wife, Napoleon&#x27;s own former fiancée, Désirée Clary, he would have had Bernadotte shot. However, contemporary evidence indicates that far from scenes of recriminations and insults alleged by Davout and his aides-de-Camp against Bernadotte the night of the battles, Napoleon was unaware anything was amiss, inasmuch as I Corps had played the part assigned to it by the Emperor, until days later.

A later search of the orders and dispatches from the Imperial Headquarters never yielded any order for Bernadotte to march with Davout. They did, however, confirm Berthier&#x27;s order of 14 October, sending Bernadotte to Dornberg. The lack of documentation supporting Napoleon&#x27;s accusation against Bernadotte calls into question whether Napoleon had intended I Corps to march with Davout, and the order was incorrectly transmitted to Bernadotte on the morning of 14 October, or if Napoleon was using the opportunity to shift blame for Davout having to fight a battle on his own as suggested by Colonel Ernst Marsh Lloyd. Napoleon later sent a severely worded reprimand to Bernadotte but took no further action.

On the Prussian side, Brunswick was mortally wounded at Auerstedt, and over the next few days, the remaining forces were unable to mount any serious resistance to Murat&#x27;s ruthless cavalry pursuit. In the Capitulation of Erfurt on 16 October, a large body of Prussian troops became prisoners with hardly a shot being fired. Bernadotte crushed Eugene Frederick Henry, Duke of Württemberg&#x27;s Prussian Reserve Army on the 17th in the Battle of Halle, partially redeeming himself in Napoleon&#x27;s eyes. In recognition of his glorious victory at Auerstadt, Napoleon gave Davout the honor of entering Berlin first. Davout led his exhausted III Corps into Berlin in triumph on 25 October. Hohenlohe&#x27;s force surrendered on 28 October after the Battle of Prenzlau, followed soon after by the Capitulation of Pasewalk. The French ran down and captured several small Prussian columns at Boldekow on 30 October, Anklam on 1 November, Wolgast on 3 November, and Wismar on 5 November.

21,000 Prussian field troops remained at large west of the Oder as November began under the command of Gebhard Blücher. French advances prevented his corps from crossing the Oder, or moving toward Stettin to seek waterborne transport to East Prussia. Bernadotte began a relentless pursuit of Blücher, with the two forces engaging in several holding actions, and was later joined by Murat and Soult in &quot;The Pursuit of the Three Marshals.&quot; Blücher then moved west to cross into neutral Denmark but the Danes placed their army on the border with the intent of attacking any force that tried to cross it. The Prussians then violated the neutrality of the Hanseatic City of Lübeck and fortified it with the intent of joining forces with an allied Swedish contingent there on its way home, and commandeering ships in the hopes of reaching a safe harbor. However, Blücher and Winning&#x27;s corps was surrounded and destroyed in what became the Battle of Lübeck on 6 and 7 November after Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps, still smarting from the Emperor&#x27;s censure, stormed the fortified city gates, poured into the streets and squares breaking hasty attempts at resistance and captured Blücher&#x27;s command post (and his Chief of Staff Gerhard von Scharnhorst) as Soult&#x27;s troops blocked all escape routes. The Prussians lost 3000 killed and wounded. On the morning of 7 November, with all hope of escape extinguished, Blücher surrendered personally to Bernadotte and went into captivity with 9,000 other Prussian prisoners of war. The Siege of Magdeburg ended on 11 November with Ney&#x27;s capture of the fortress. Isolated Prussian resistance remained, but Napoleon&#x27;s primary foe was now Russia, and the Battle of Eylau and the Battle of Friedland awaited.

Martin van Creveld has stated about the effects on command:

==Influence==

The battle proved most influential in demonstrating the need for reforms in what was a very much feudal Prussian state and army. Important Prussian reformers like Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Clausewitz served at the battle. Their reforms, together with civilian reforms instituted over the following years, began Prussia&#x27;s transformation into a modern state, which took the forefront in expelling France from Germany and eventually assumed a leading role on the continent. The reduction of Prussia to a French vassal, and the subsequent revolt that restored national honor, formed a key component of German nationalism.

Napoleon built a bridge in Paris which he named after the battle. When he was defeated, the Prussian contingent of the allied forces of occupation was so incensed by its name that they wished to destroy the bridge. Talleyrand temporarily renamed the bridge after the French Grand Army, which dissuaded them from doing so. The station of the Paris Metro at the bridge has the same name.

Near Jena, several hiking trails are named after Napoleon and some of his marshals. In the villages of Cospeda is a museum about the battle. To mark the 200th anniversary the battle was re-enacted on 14 October 2006 with 1,800 participants on a 600 m by 800 meters enclosed area near the village of Cospeda. Annually in October, close to the historical date, commemorative events are organized by the association &quot;Jena 1806 e. V.&quot;. This takes place on a grander scale every five years. The award winning short film &quot;Into the Battle&quot; by David Cebulla was produced during the 210th anniversary reenactment of the battle.

<text>The Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football, abbreviated as CONCACAF ( ; typeset for branding purposes since 2018 as Concacaf), is one of FIFA&#x27;s six continental governing bodies for association football. Its 41 member associations represent countries and territories mainly in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, and, for geopolitical reasons, 3 nations from the Guianas subregion of South America-Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana (an overseas region of France). The CONCACAF&#x27;s primary functions are to organize competitions for national teams and clubs, and to conduct the World Cup and Women&#x27;s World Cup qualifying tournaments.

The CONCACAF was founded in its current form on 18 September 1961 in Mexico City, Mexico, with the merger of the NAFC and the CCCF, which made it one of the then five, now six, continental confederations affiliated with FIFA. Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Netherlands Antilles (Curaçao, Aruba), Nicaragua, Panama, Suriname and the United States were founding members.

Mexico dominated CONCACAF men&#x27;s competitions early on and has won the most Gold Cups. The Mexico national football team is the only men&#x27;s CONCACAF team to win an official FIFA tournament by winning the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup. Mexico and the U.S. have won all but one of the editions of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. In 2014, Costa Rica became the 4th CONCACAF country after the United States, Cuba, and Mexico to make the World Cup quarterfinals, while Panama became the eleventh country from the confederation to participate in the World Cup in 2018. The CONCACAF Nations League was established in 2018, with the United States winning all three editions.

The United States has been the most successful team in the world in the women&#x27;s game, being the only CONCACAF member to win all three major worldwide competitions in women&#x27;s football—the World Cup (4), the Olympics (5), and the Algarve Cup (10). Canada is the only other member to win at least two of the major competitions, winning the 2016 Algarve Cup and the 2020 Olympics.

According to the Coaches Across Continents (CAC) annual report for 2021, CONCACAF is a partner of CAC. CAC is a worldwide partnership of over 100 organizations that seeks to create active citizens and achieve social impact through sport.

==Governance==
The CONCACAF is led by a general secretary, executive committee, congress, and several standing committees. The executive committee is composed of eight members — one president, three vice-presidents, three members, and one female member. Each of the three geographic zones in CONCACAF is represented by one vice-president and one member. The executive committee carries out the various statutes, regulations, and resolutions.

==Leadership==


The first leader of CONCACAF was Costa Rican Ramón Coll Jaumet; he had overseen the merger between the North American Football Confederation (NAFC) and the Confederación Centroamericana y del Caribe de Fútbol (CCCF). In 1969, he was succeeded in the role by Mexican Joaquín Soria Terrazas, who served as president for 21 years.

His successor Jack Warner was the CONCACAF president from 1990 to 2011, also for 21 years. Warner was suspended as president on 30 May 2011 due to his temporary suspension from football-related activity by FIFA following corruption allegations. Chuck Blazer was the general secretary during the same period.

On 20 June 2011, Jack Warner resigned from the presidency of CONCACAF, and removed himself from all participation in football, in the wake of the corruption investigation resulting from 10 May 2011 meeting of the Caribbean Football Union. The vice-president of CONCACAF, Alfredo Hawit, acted as president until May 2012.

In May 2012, Cayman Islands banker Jeffrey Webb was installed as president of CONCACAF. On 27 May 2015, Webb was arrested in Zurich, Switzerland on corruption charges in the U.S.

Victor Montagliani, leader of the Canadian Soccer Association, was elected as president of CONCACAF in May 2016.

===CONCACAF Council===
==Corporate structure==
CONCACAF is a non-profit company registered in Nassau, The Bahamas.

The headquarters of the CONCACAF are located in Miami, United States. Previously it had been the Admiral Financial Center, George Town, Cayman Islands—the home city of former CONCACAF president Jeffrey Webb and prior to that, they were based in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago under the presidency of Jack Warner. The administration office of CONCACAF was previously located in Trump Tower, New York, when Chuck Blazer was the general secretary.

In February 2017, a satellite office was opened in Kingston, Jamaica. In July 2017, a second satellite office was opened in Guatemala City, which is shared with the Central American Football Union (UNCAF), and most recently another satellite office for the FIFA Caribbean Development Office was opened in the suburb of Welches, in Bridgetown, Barbados.

==Members==
CONCACAF has 41 member associations:

Bonaire were promoted from an association member to a full member at the XXIX Ordinary CONCACAF Congress in São Paulo on 10 June 2014.

Teams not affiliated to the IOC are not eligible to participate in the Summer Olympics football tournament, as a result, they do not participate in the CONCACAF Men&#x27;s Pre-Olympic Tournament or the CONCACAF Women&#x27;s Pre-Olympic Tournament.

===Prospective members===
* — The Football Association of Greenland announced in May 2022 that they had officially begun the process of becoming a member of CONCACAF and were expected to attend the body&#x27;s next congress with observer status. Greenland was not officially able to apply to join UEFA, even with political links with Denmark, due to UEFA applicants being required to apply as sovereign states. Kenneth Kleist was elected new president of the KAK in October 2023. At that time, he announced the association&#x27;s intentions to apply for full CONCACAF membership in 2024. At that time, he also stated that the association had been informed that it was &quot;quite close to admission&quot; in the confederation. On 28 May 2024, Greenland officially applied for full CONCACAF membership.

===Aspiring future members===
*, announced in 2019 that the Comité Territorial de Football de Saint-Barthélemy began the process of joining the Caribbean Football Union and CONCACAF for the first time.
*, announced in September 2019 that The Football Association of Saint Pierre and Miquelon is expected to build a suitable venue with the goal of becoming a member of CONCACAF in the near future. 
* were rumored by Greenland Manager Morten Rutjkær, to be interested in joining CONCACAF. This follows a failed bid to join the European confederation UEFA in 2020. Jersey would geographically be closest to the North American Football Union were they to join, although located over 2,200 miles from Canada.

===Other non-members===
*, announced in May 2014 that they were working to become a member of CONCACAF and play against other national teams. The team is not a member of FIFA, but were a member of Confederation of Independent Football Associations (ConIFA). In May 2014, the team withdrew from the ConIFA World Championship after associating with the Québec Soccer Federation. The team and association decided to take part in only &quot;federated&quot; soccer in hopes of one day being recognized as a CONCACAF member. There has not been any further conversation and players from this Canadian province qualify for, as well as the province being formally represented by, the Canadian national soccer team.

Although one of the three special municipalities of the Netherlands in the region is a member of CONCACAF (), the other two are not:
*

==Membership relation==

Elections at the CONCACAF Congress are mandated with a one-member, one-vote rule. The North American Football Union is the smallest association union in the region with only three members, but its nations have strong commercial and marketing support from sponsors and they are the most populous nations in the region.

The Caribbean Football Union has the ability to outvote NAFU and UNCAF with less than half of its membership. Consequently, there is a fractious relationship between members of CFU, UNCAF and NAFU. This provoked former Acting-President Alfredo Hawit to lobby for the CONCACAF Presidency to be rotated between the three unions in CONCACAF in 2011.

Trinidad&#x27;s Jack Warner presided over CONCACAF for 21 years, and there was little that non-Caribbean nations could do to elect an alternative. Under Warner, the CFU members voted together as a unit with Warner acting as a party whip. It happened with such regularity that sports political commentators referred to the CFU votes as the &quot;Caribbean bloc&quot; vote. Warner rejected the idea in 1993 of merging several smaller nations&#x27; national teams into a Pan-Caribbean team. His reasoning was that the nations were more powerful politically when separate than when together. He commented that &quot;being small is never a liability in this sport&quot;.

===CONCACAF Gold Cup===

The CONCACAF Gold Cup, held since 1991, is the main association football competition of the men&#x27;s national football teams governed by CONCACAF. The Gold Cup is CONCACAF&#x27;s flagship competition, and generates a significant part of CONCACAF&#x27;s revenue.

The Gold Cup determines the regional champion of North America, Central America, and the Caribbean, and is held every two years. Starting with the 2019 edition, 16 teams compete for the Gold Cup (up from 12).

===CONCACAF Nations League===
All men&#x27;s national teams of member associations take part in the CONCACAF Nations League, a competition created in 2017. National teams are placed into tiers and play matches against teams in the same tier. At the end of each season, teams can be promoted to the tier above or relegated to the tier below depending upon their results.

===CONCACAF Champions Cup===

The CONCACAF Champions Cup, originally known as the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup and later the CONCACAF Champions League, is an annual continental club association football competition organized by CONCACAF since 1962 for the top football clubs in the region. It is the most prestigious international club competition in North American football. The winner of the Champions Cup qualifies for the FIFA Club World Cup. The knockout tournament spans February through April.

From 2024, 27 teams compete in each Champions Cup; 18 from North America, 6 from Central America and 3 from the Caribbean. North American teams qualify via either their domestic leagues and cups or the Leagues Cup competition between American and Mexican clubs, while Central American and Caribbean clubs qualify via the CONCACAF Central American Cup and CONCACAF Caribbean Cup respectively

The title has been won by 28 clubs, 13 of which have won the title more than once. Mexican clubs have accumulated the highest number of victories, with 36 titles. The second most successful league has been Costa Rica&#x27;s Primera División with six titles in total. The most successful club is Club América from Mexico, with seven titles; fellow Mexico side Cruz Azul is just behind with six.

==Corruption==

At the CONCACAF Congress in May 2012 in Budapest, Hungary, legal counsel John P. Collins informed the members of CONCACAF of several financial irregularities. Collins revealed that Jack Warner, the former CONCACAF President, had registered the $22 million &#x27;Dr. João Havelange Centre of Excellence&#x27; development in Port-of-Spain under the name of two companies that Warner owned.
In addition, Warner had secured a mortgage against the asset in 2007 which the CONCACAF members were also unaware of; the mortgage was co-signed by Lisle Austin, a former vice-president of CONCACAF. The loan defaulted.

Collins also revealed that CONCACAF, despite most of its income coming from the United States, had not paid any tax to the Internal Revenue Service since at least 2007 and had never filed a return in the United States. Although CONCACAF is a registered non-profit organization in the Bahamas and headquartered in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, they have an administration office in New York, and BDO and CONCACAF invited the IRS to investigate potential liabilities. It is thought that CONCACAF may have to pay up to $2 million plus penalties.

Chuck Blazer stated that a full financial audit into CONCACAF by New-York based consultancy BDO was delayed due to the actions of Jack Warner and his personal accountant, and the accounts could not be &quot;signed off&quot; as a consequence.

In addition, Blazer is to sue CONCACAF for unpaid commission of sponsorship and marketing deals which he had made in 2010 during his time as general secretary. Blazer received a 10% commission on any deal that he made on behalf of CONCACAF.

The Bermuda FA asked members of CONCACAF to lobby FIFA to remove Blazer from his position on the FIFA Executive Committee. Blazer suggested that it was less to do with financial irregularities and more for his role in the removal of Jack Warner in the Caribbean Football Union corruption scandal: &quot;I spent 21 years building the confederation and its competitions and its revenues and I&#x27;m the one responsible for its good levels of income . . . I think this is a reflection of those who were angry at me having caused the action against Warner. This is also a reaction by people who have their own agenda.&quot;

Jack Warner presided over CONCACAF for 21 years. Warner was one of the most controversial figures in world football. Warner was suspended as president on 30 May 2011 due to his temporary suspension from football-related activity by FIFA following corruption allegations. A power struggle developed at CONCACAF following the allegations against Warner. The allegations against Warner were reported to the FIFA Ethics Committee by Chuck Blazer, the secretary general of CONCACAF. The acting president of CONCACAF, Lisle Austin, sent Blazer a letter saying he was &quot;terminated as general secretary with immediate effect&quot;. Austin described Blazer&#x27;s actions as &quot;inexcusable and a gross misconduct of duty and judgement&quot; and said the American was no longer fit to hold the post. The executive committee of CONCACAF later issued a statement saying that Austin did not have the authority to fire Blazer, and the decision was unauthorized. On 20 June 2011, Jack Warner resigned from the presidency of CONCACAF, all posts with FIFA, and removed himself from all participation in football, in the wake of the corruption investigation resulting from 10 May 2011 meeting of the Caribbean Football Union. The vice-president of CONCACAF, Alfredo Hawit, acted as president until May 2012.

=== FIFA World Cup ===
Only eleven CONCACAF members have ever reached the FIFA World Cup since its inception in 1930, six of them accomplishing the feat only once. No team from the region has ever reached the final at the World Cup, but the United States reached the semi-finals in the inaugural edition, for which they were awarded third place. CONCACAF members have reached the quarter-finals five times: Cuba in 1938, Mexico as hosts in 1970 and 1986, the United States in 2002, and most recently, Costa Rica in 2014. Jamaica is the smallest country to ever win a World Cup match, by virtue of their 2–1 victory over Japan in 1998.

The following table shows the CONCACAF representatives at each edition of the World Cup, sorted by number of appearances:

==== FIFA World Cup hosting ====
CONCACAF nations have hosted the FIFA World Cup three times.

The 1970 FIFA World Cup took place in Mexico, the first World Cup tournament to be staged in North America, and the first held outside Europe and South America.
Mexico was chosen as the host nation in 1964 by FIFA&#x27;s congress ahead of the only other submitted bid from Argentina. The tournament was won by Brazil. The victorious team led by Carlos Alberto, and featuring players such as Pelé, Gérson, Jairzinho, Rivellino, and Tostão, is often cited as the greatest-ever World Cup team. They achieved a perfect record of wins in all six games in the finals. Despite the issues of altitude and high temperature, the finals produced attacking football which created an average goals per game record not since bettered by any subsequent World Cup Finals. The 1970 Finals attracted a new record television audience for the FIFA World Cup and, for the first time, in color.

In 1986, Mexico became the first country to host the FIFA World Cup twice when it stepped in to stage the 1986 FIFA World Cup after the original host selection, Colombia, suffered financial problems.
Colombia was originally chosen as hosts by FIFA in June 1974. However, the Colombian authorities eventually declared in November 1982 that they could not afford to host the World Cup because of economic concerns. Mexico was selected on 20 May 1983 as the replacement hosts, beating the bids of Canada and the United States, and thereby became the first nation to host two World Cups. This second World Cup in Mexico came 16 years after the first one in 1970.

The United States won the right to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup, defeating bids from Brazil and Morocco. The vote was held in Zurich on 4 July 1988, and only took one round with the United States bid receiving a little over half of the votes by the Exco members. FIFA hoped that by staging the world&#x27;s most prestigious football tournament there, it would lead to a growth of interest in the sport; one condition FIFA imposed was the creation of a professional football league, Major League Soccer, starting in 1996. The U.S. staged a hugely successful tournament, with average attendance of nearly 69,000 breaking a record that surpassed the 1966 FIFA World Cup average attendance of 51,000 thanks to the large seating capacities the American stadiums provided for the spectators in comparison to the smaller venues of Europe and Latin America. To this day, the total attendance for the final tournament of nearly 3.6 million remains the highest in World Cup history, despite the expansion of the competition to 32 teams at the 1998 World Cup.

Canada, Mexico, and the United States have won the bidding to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup, competing against a Moroccan bid.

<doc id="295171" wikidata="Q93390" url="?curid=295171" title="Archduchess Elisabeth Marie of Austria">
<text>Archduchess Elisabeth Marie Henriette Stephanie Gisela of Austria (; 2 September 1883 – 16 March 1963) was the only child of Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, and Princess Stéphanie of Belgium. Her father was the son and heir apparent of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, and her mother was a daughter of King Leopold II of Belgium. She was known to her family as &quot;Erzsi&quot;, a diminutive of her name in Hungarian. Later nicknamed The Red Archduchess, she was famous for becoming a socialist and a member of the Austrian Social Democratic Party.

==Early life==
Archduchess Elisabeth, nicknamed &#x27;Erzsi&#x27;, was born at Schloss Laxenburg on 2 September 1883 to Crown Prince Rudolf and Stéphanie, daughter of King Leopold II of Belgium. She was named after her grandmothers, Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Queen Marie Henriette of Belgium. Erzsi was Franz Joseph&#x27;s only grandchild through his son.

In 1889, when Erzsi was a little over five years old, her father and Baroness Mary von Vetsera, his mistress, were found dead in what was assumed to be a murder-suicide pact at the Imperial hunting lodge at Mayerling. Her father&#x27;s death interrupted the dynastic succession within the Austrian imperial family, fractured her grandparents&#x27; already tenuous marriage and was a catalyst in Austria-Hungary&#x27;s gradual destabilization, which culminated in the First World War and the subsequent disintegration of the Habsburg Empire.

After Rudolf&#x27;s death, Franz Joseph took over guardianship of Erzsi; by his order, she was forbidden to leave Austria with her mother. At a young age she displayed a strong personality, as well as an opposition to the Viennese court.

Her grandmother, the capricious and image obsessed Empress Elisabeth, did not enjoy being identified as a grandmother and was therefore not close to any of her grandchildren. However, after her assassination in 1898, her will specified that outside a large bequest of the sale of her jewels to benefit charities and religious orders, all of her personal property was bequeathed to Erzsi, her namesake and Rudolf&#x27;s only child. The Empress made no secret of her dislike of her daughter-in-law prior to the scandal, and after the Mayerling incident, blamed Stéphanie&#x27;s jealous behavior for her son&#x27;s depression and suicide. The crown princess herself was entirely dependent on the Emperor&#x27;s charity, therefore the lack of imperial support towards Stéphanie following her husband&#x27;s death negatively impacted her relationship with her daughter; the parent and child were never close.
In 1900, Stéphanie renounced her title of Crown Princess to marry the Protestant Hungarian count Elemér Lónyay von Nagy-Lónya und Vásáros-Namény (he was eventually made a Prince in 1917 by Emperor Karl I.). Although Emperor Franz Joseph provided his daughter-in-law with a dowry and Lónyay eventually converted to Roman Catholicism, Elisabeth broke off all contact with her mother as she disapproved of the marriage, feeling it a betrayal of her father&#x27;s memory. Later, following her marriage, Stéphanie retaliated by disinheriting Elisabeth in 1934.

==First marriage==
Elisabeth was considered a potential bride for several princes in Europe; among them was her cousin Prince Albert, heir presumptive to the throne of Belgium. However, King Leopold II vehemently disapproved of Stéphanie&#x27;s recent morganatic marriage to Count Elemér Lónyay and thus refused to give Albert his permission. Albert&#x27;s sister Henriette was horrified at her brother&#x27;s choice, feeling Elisabeth&#x27;s background was too unstable for the marriage to be a success.
During a court ball in 1900, Elisabeth met Prince Otto Weriand of Windisch-Graetz (1873–1952), son of Prince Ernst Ferdinand Weriand of Windisch-Graetz (1827–1918) and Princess Kamilla Amalia Caroline Notgera of Oettingen-Oettingen und Oettingen-Spielberg (1845–1888). Ten years her senior, he was below her in rank. Nonetheless she importuned her grandfather to be allowed to marry him. Franz Joseph resisted at first, having intended for Elisabeth to marry the German Crown Prince, but eventually relented. Elisabeth and Prince Otto were related through her grandmother Sissi. They were third cousins twice removed as Otto was third cousin of the late Empress, both descending from Duke Charles Marie of Arenberg. By many accounts it was Elisabeth alone who wanted the marriage, as Otto was already engaged to a Countess von Schönborn and was reportedly dumbfounded when Franz Joseph informed him of his new engagement. Ordered by the Emperor to break his &quot;lesser&quot; engagement to marry his granddaughter, he complied.

In order to avoid future succession issues, the Emperor made the marriage conditional on Elisabeth&#x27;s renouncing her right to succession, although he allowed her to keep her personal title and style, as well as providing her with a generous dowry. While his family was officially listed in the Habsburg list of families which were allowed to make an equal marriage (&quot;Ebenbürtigkeit&quot;) with an Imperial family, they still regarded Otto&#x27;s Mediatized House and the marriage as a mésalliance and wanted the marriage to be treated as morganatic. As it was a case of the Emperor&#x27;s favorite granddaughter and Otto&#x27;s family was legally considered equal for dynastic purposes, as were marriages with all other mediatized Princely families, the marriage was officially treated as equal and his family would have grounds for pressing Elisabeth to become empress should the succession become interrupted again.

The couple married at the Hofburg on 23 January 1902. They had three sons: Prince Franz Joseph, Prince Ernst and Prince Rudolf. Their last child and only daughter, Princess Stephanie, was born at Ploschkowitz.

The marriage, however, was troubled, and led to unwelcome reminders for the Emperor of his son&#x27;s death, and possible further scandal for the family: 
==&quot;The Red Archduchess&quot;==
Throughout their marriage both Elisabeth and Otto were open in having affairs, most notably the former&#x27;s liaison with the young Austrian naval officer Egon Lerch, who would later command the submarine U-12 during World War I.

Only after the death of Franz Joseph in 1916 and the end of the monarchy in 1918 did the couple officially separate. In 1921 Elisabeth joined the Social Democratic Party, where she met Leopold Petznek from Bruck an der Leitha, then president of the audit office, at one of the election meetings. A teacher and a committed Social Democratic politician who became president of the Lower Austrian &quot;Landtag&quot; (state parliament) after the war, Petznek came from a modest background, but was highly cultivated. He was also married; his wife, with whom he had a son, was institutionalized at a psychiatric hospital in Mauer-Ohling, where she died on 9 June 1935.

The lengthy legal process dragged on, and it was not until March 1924 that Elisabeth was able to obtain a judicial separation. A sensational custody battle for their four children ensued. Originally the court granted Elisabeth custody of the two elder sons, while their younger son and daughter were to live with Otto. She is supposed to have prevented this either by presenting Otto with a house full of armed Socialists when he came to remove them, or else by threatening him with suicide should she have to give them up. In any event, Elisabeth ultimately retained custody of all four children. Elisabeth doted on her children when they were young, but her relationship with them deteriorated as they grew older. Rudolf, in accordance with her socialist views, was reportedly taken out of school and put to work in a factory. Elisabeth and her daughter Stephanie did not have a good relationship; she reportedly stated that she married her first husband based on the fact that her mother did not like him.

Elisabeth moved to the Hütteldorf district of Vienna and bought a villa in 1929, where she lived with Petznek for the next twenty years. She was at his side at Social Democratic marches and meetings, where she was accepted and accorded great respect. Leopold, however, due to his &quot;haughty&quot; character, was not welcome in aristocratic circles. In 1934 her husband and son made a legal motion to place her under a conservatorship on the grounds that she had squandered profits from the sale of the couple&#x27;s property in numerous donations, made in order to join the Social Democrats. The motion was later dropped. Although divorce became legal in 1938, when Austria became part of Germany and adopted German law after the Anschluss, Elisabeth was not able to divorce her husband until after the end of the war.

==Second marriage==
In late 1933 Petznek was arrested and imprisoned by the Austrian government until July 1934. In 1944, he was arrested by the Nazis and sent to Dachau concentration camp until the camp was liberated by the Americans in March 1945. After the war he became the first President of the Austrian Federal Court of Audit. 
Since Elisabeth renounced her official title of Archduchess to the House of Habsburg at the time of her first marriage, the new Habsburg Laws did not apply to her; she was allowed to stay in Austria and retain her personal possessions. She formally divorced Prince Otto in early 1948, and on 4 May 1948 she and Leopold married in a registry office in Vienna.

When Vienna was occupied by the Red Army, Elisabeth&#x27;s villa was commandeered and then ransacked by Soviet soldiers. When Hütteldorf became part of the French occupied zone, the villa was occupied by General Bethouart; Elisabeth and Leopold were not allowed to return until 1955, when the Allied occupation ended. By then both were in poor health: Petznek died in July 1956 from a heart attack, while Elisabeth—who was confined to a wheelchair due to gout—bred German Shepherds, but became reclusive until her death in 1963.

==Aftermath==

On her deathbed, she ordered her staff to close her villa against her two surviving children and call for a police detail to secure her belongings until the Ministry of Education could remove them. Only her daughter was allowed to see her for a few moments, in the presence of her servants. She had willed some 500 heirlooms, owned by the Habsburg Imperial family, to the Republic of Austria. Over the objections of her first husband, who thought they should go to their children, she wanted all art and books to &quot;be put back in their former places&quot;, as she did not believe Imperial property should be sold at auction or come into the possession of foreigners; these pieces are in museums in Vienna today.

She died in Vienna, aged 79. According to her wishes, she was buried in an unmarked grave at the Hütteldorfer Friedhof in Vienna with her second husband, close to the house where she spent her last years.

Since 1995, the villa has been in the possession of the international (Buddhist) community Soka Gakkai International.

<doc id="295172" wikidata="Q384756" url="?curid=295172" title="Ana Ng">
<text>&quot;Ana Ng&quot; ( ) is a song by alternative rock band They Might Be Giants. It was released as the lead single from the band&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Lincoln&quot;. Although the song was their first US chart appearance, hitting number 11 on the US Modern Rock chart, the single was never officially released in the US. It was only released for promotional purposes in the US, and it saw official releases in 1989 in the United Kingdom (as a maxi-single), Australia, and later, in 1991, in Europe.

==Background==
The title of the track came from an experience that band members John Flansburgh and John Linnell (the Johns) had when they found a huge number of Ng listings in the New York City phone book.

Linnell: &quot;I think I was collecting possible song ideas and, for some reason, I ended up looking in the phone book, and there were about four pages of this name that contains no vowels, Ng. I was fascinated because it&#x27;s a name I didn&#x27;t know about before, and it was filling up a large chunk of the Manhattan white pages. I called up some of the numbers kind of experimentally to find out how it was pronounced, and I got the phone machine of a Dr. Ng and I was kind of relieved. The message said, &#x27;Dr. Ng is not in,&#x27; and I had my material.&quot; (Pitchfork Magazine, 1996)

&quot;Ng&quot; is a common Cantonese family name; in Cantonese, it is pronounced , like the last sound in the English word &quot;song&quot;.

Linnell: &quot;The other inspiration for [Ana Ng] was a Pogo comic strip. [...] Some of the characters are digging a hole. They decide they&#x27;re going to dig to China, but one of the smarter characters pulls this huge revolver out of a drawer and shoots a hole &quot;in the desktop globe.&quot; Then they look at the other side and the hole is in the Indian Ocean. (Pitchfork Magazine, 1996).

The song, or at least part of it, is set against the backdrop of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, which John Linnell attended as a child. It includes references to &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; and the DuPont pavilion, both attractions at the fair.

The line &quot;I don&#x27;t want the world / I just want your half&quot; is said by Lisa Klapp, a friend of the Johns, and recorded through a telephone.

==Music video==
A music video for the song was shot at the Ward&#x27;s Island Fireman&#x27;s Training Center, and was directed by Adam Bernstein. The song makes mention of a &quot;foreign nation&quot; while a map of Romania (specifically the cities of Bragadiru and Slobozia) is shown.

In 2006, a Pitchfork Media staff review of &quot;100 Awesome Music Videos&quot; included &quot;Ana Ng&quot; on the list. The review praised the video&#x27;s simplicity, stating that it &quot;matches They Might Be Giants&#x27; weird lyrics with equally weird visuals that eschew literality in favor of strange juxtapositions of Cold War ephemera that subtly shade the song with new meanings.&quot; It also commented on the lack of special effects: &quot;[T]he clip is just two guys, a camera, and a cool set. And that&#x27;s all you need.&quot;

==Reception==
The song has been well received by numerous critics. Longtime music critic Robert Christgau called it &quot;a beyond-perfect tour de force about a Vietnamese woman they never got to meet.&quot; In a review for &quot;Lincoln&quot; on AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described &quot;Ana Ng&quot; as a standout song having &quot;irresistible pop hooks&quot;. Also for AllMusic, critic Steve Huey reviewed the individual song at length, naming it &quot;a masterpiece of pop absurdism.&quot; He cited its &quot;typically playful, seemingly free-associative&quot; lyrics, noting that the syntax is &quot;elongated and convoluted, as one prepositional phrase after another gets tacked on; it&#x27;s a subtle expression of the group&#x27;s sense of humor&quot;.

==Other uses==
*&quot;Ana Ng&quot; has been covered by the rock band Self on the album &quot;Hello Radio: The Songs of They Might Be Giants&quot;.
*The song was featured during the 2008 Jim Carrey comedy film &quot;Yes Man&quot;.
*The song played in the first episode of the 1991 sitcom &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; while Clarissa proclaimed her affinity for John Linnell.
*The song was covered by Star Fucking Hipsters on their 2011 album &quot;From the Dumpster to the Grave&quot;.
*&quot;Ana Ng&quot; is referenced and interpolated in the Car Seat Headrest song &quot;Cute Thing&quot;.

<doc id="295183" wikidata="Q219207" url="?curid=295183" title="Galilean transformation">
<text>In physics, a Galilean transformation is used to transform between the coordinates of two reference frames which differ only by constant relative motion within the constructs of Newtonian physics. These transformations together with spatial rotations and translations in space and time form the inhomogeneous Galilean group (assumed throughout below). Without the translations in space and time the group is the homogeneous Galilean group. The Galilean group is the group of motions of Galilean relativity acting on the four dimensions of space and time, forming the Galilean geometry. This is the passive transformation point of view. In special relativity the homogeneous and inhomogeneous Galilean transformations are, respectively, replaced by the Lorentz transformations and Poincaré transformations; conversely, the group contraction in the classical limit of Poincaré transformations yields Galilean transformations.

The equations below are only physically valid in a Newtonian framework, and not applicable to coordinate systems moving relative to each other at speeds approaching the speed of light.

Galileo formulated these concepts in his description of &quot;uniform motion&quot;.
The topic was motivated by his description of the motion of a ball rolling down a ramp, by which he measured the numerical value for the acceleration of gravity near the surface of the Earth.

==Translation==

Although the transformations are named for Galileo, it is the absolute time and space as conceived by Isaac Newton that provides their domain of definition. In essence, the Galilean transformations embody the intuitive notion of addition and subtraction of velocities as vectors.

The notation below describes the relationship under the Galilean transformation between the coordinates and of a single arbitrary event, as measured in two coordinate systems and , in uniform relative motion (velocity ) in their common and directions, with their spatial origins coinciding at time :

:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4

Note that the last equation holds for all Galilean transformations up to addition of a constant, and expresses the assumption of a universal time independent of the relative motion of different observers.

In the language of linear algebra, this transformation is considered a shear mapping, and is described with a matrix acting on a vector. With motion parallel to the &quot;x&quot;-axis, the transformation acts on only two components:
:formula_5
Though matrix representations are not strictly necessary for Galilean transformation, they provide the means for direct comparison to transformation methods in special relativity.

==Galilean transformations==
The Galilean symmetries can be uniquely written as the composition of a &quot;rotation&quot;, a &quot;translation&quot; and a &quot;uniform motion&quot; of spacetime. Let represent a point in three-dimensional space, and a point in one-dimensional time. A general point in spacetime is given by an ordered pair .

A uniform motion, with velocity , is given by 
:formula_6
where . A translation is given by
:formula_7
where and . A rotation is given by
:formula_8 
where is an orthogonal transformation.

As a Lie group, the group of Galilean transformations has dimension 10.

==Galilean group==
Two Galilean transformations and compose to form a third Galilean transformation, 
The set of all Galilean transformations forms a group with composition as the group operation.

The group is sometimes represented as a matrix group with spacetime events as vectors where is real and is a position in space. 
The action is given by
:formula_9
where is real and and is a rotation matrix. 
The composition of transformations is then accomplished through matrix multiplication. Care must be taken in the discussion whether one restricts oneself to the connected component group of the orthogonal transformations.

 has named subgroups. The identity component is denoted .

Let represent the transformation matrix with parameters :
* formula_10 anisotropic transformations.
* formula_11 isochronous transformations.
* formula_12 spatial Euclidean transformations.
* formula_13 uniformly special transformations / homogeneous transformations, isomorphic to Euclidean transformations.
* formula_14 shifts of origin / translation in Newtonian spacetime.
* formula_15 rotations (of reference frame) (see SO(3)), a compact group. 
* formula_16 uniform frame motions / boosts.

The parameters span ten dimensions. Since the transformations depend continuously on , is a continuous group, also called a topological group.

The structure of can be understood by reconstruction from subgroups. The semidirect product combination (formula_17) of groups is required. 
#formula_18 ( is a normal subgroup)
#formula_19
#formula_20
#formula_21
#formula_22

==Origin in group contraction==
The Lie algebra of the Galilean group is spanned by and (an antisymmetric tensor), subject to commutation relations, where
:formula_23
:formula_24
:formula_25
:formula_26
:formula_27
:formula_28
:formula_29
:formula_30
:formula_31
 is the generator of time translations (Hamiltonian), is the generator of translations (momentum operator), is the generator of rotationless Galilean transformations (Galileian boosts), and stands for a generator of rotations (angular momentum operator).

This Lie Algebra is seen to be a special classical limit of the algebra of the Poincaré group, in the limit . Technically, the Galilean group is a celebrated group contraction of the Poincaré group (which, in turn, is a group contraction of the de Sitter group ).
Formally, renaming the generators of momentum and boost of the latter as in
:, 
where is the speed of light (or any unbounded function thereof), the commutation relations (structure constants) in the limit take on the relations of the former. 
Generators of time translations and rotations are identified. Also note the group invariants and .

In matrix form, for , one may consider the &quot;regular representation&quot; (embedded in , from which it could be derived by a single group contraction, bypassing the Poincaré group), 
formula_32
formula_33
formula_34
formula_35

The infinitesimal group element is then 
::formula_36

== Central extension of the Galilean group ==
One may consider a central extension of the Lie algebra of the Galilean group, spanned by and an operator &quot;M&quot;: 
The so-called Bargmann algebra is obtained by imposing formula_37, such that lies in the center, i.e. commutes with all other operators.

In full, this algebra is given as
:formula_38
:formula_39
:formula_40
:formula_41
:formula_42
:formula_43
:formula_44
:formula_45
and finally 
:formula_46
where the new parameter formula_47 shows up. 
This extension and projective representations that this enables is determined by its group cohomology.

<text>Brian David Sibley (born 14 July 1949) is an English writer. He is author of over 100 hours of radio drama and has written and presented hundreds of radio documentaries, features and weekly programmes. Among his adaptations is the 1981 version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for radio. A columnist and author, he is widely known as the author of many film &quot;making of&quot; books, including those for the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogies.

== Early life ==

Sibley was born in Wandsworth, London, to Eric George Sibley, an architectural draughtsman, and Doris Alice Sibley (née Summers). His uncle was the philosopher Frank Sibley.

His family moved to Chislehurst, Kent when he was five years old. He was educated at St Nicholas Church of England Primary School and Chislehurst Secondary School for Boys (later renamed Edgebury School for Boys), where he was awarded A-levels in English and Art.

Following the frustration of his varied ambitions to be an actor, a cartoonist and an animator, Sibley worked first in various clerical capacities for the London Borough of Bromley, and then for a shipping and finance company in London as a clerk, office manager and head of department. In his spare time he began submitting scripts to the BBC and, when his company was taken over, he accepted redundancy and became a full-time freelance writer.

== Career ==

Radio writing and broadcasting

Sibley&#x27;s first programme was &quot;Three Cheers for Pooh&quot;, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 14 October 1976 to mark the 50th anniversary of the publication of A. A. Milne&#x27;s &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;. The programme was presented by actor Peter Bull, featured the voices of Norman Shelley and pianist and singer Antony Miall and was directed by John Tydeman, later Head of BBC Drama.

Other features quickly followed and, in 1981, he co-wrote (with Michael Bakewell) BBC Radio 4&#x27;s adaptation of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; He also adapted C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; and Mervyn Peake&#x27;s &quot;Titus Groan&quot; and &quot;Gormenghast&quot; for Radio 4, receiving a Sony Radio Award for his Peake plays in 1985. He returned to Peake&#x27;s writings in 2011 with &quot;The History of Titus Groan&quot;, a cycle of six one-hour plays for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &#x27;Classic Serial&#x27; based on &quot;Titus Groan&quot;, &quot;Gormenghast&quot;, &quot;Titus Alone&quot; and Maeve Gilmore&#x27;s &quot;Titus Awakes&quot;. Produced by Jeremy Mortimer, the series began transmission on Sunday 10 July with a cast headed by David Warner, Luke Treadaway and Miranda Richardson, and won the BBC Audio Drama Award 2012 for Best Adaptation.

Other major radio dramatizations by Sibley include: John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;; Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Tales from the Perilous Realm&quot;; Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Danny, the Champion of the World&quot;; Lucy M. Boston&#x27;s &quot;The Children of Green Knowe&quot;, Laurens van der Post&#x27;s &quot;The Night of the New Moon&quot;, J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;The Thirty-First of June&quot;, Jeffrey Archer&#x27;s &quot;A Matter of Honour&quot;, Frank Baker&#x27;s &quot;Miss Hargreaves&quot;, James Thurber&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful O&quot;, two series of &quot;Ray Bradbury&#x27;s Tales of the Bizarre&quot;, Ray Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; and a six-part dramatization of T H White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; starring David Warner as Merlyn. 2016 saw the broadcasting by the BBC of his two-part dramatization of Richard Adams&#x27;s &quot;Watership Down&quot; and the J. G. Ballard short story &quot;Track 12&quot;.

His original radio plays include: &quot;...And Yet Another Partridge in a Pear Tree&quot;, starring Penelope Keith, &quot;C. S. Lewis: Northern Irishman&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late Now&quot;.

He was a contributor to and then regular presenter of the former BBC Radio 4 arts programme &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; and the BBC World Service arts magazine, &quot;Meridian&quot;. He also presented the Radio 4 film programme, &quot;Talking Pictures&quot;, was a regular presenter of &quot;The Afternoon Shift&quot; and chaired the radio panel games &quot;Break A Leg&quot; and &quot;Screen Test&quot;.

He has also contributed to Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Last Word&quot;, &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, &quot;A Good Read&quot;, &quot;The Radio 2 Arts Show&quot; and Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Night Waves&quot;. He also presented several series of the BBC television programme, &quot;First Light&quot;.

His features and documentaries for Radio 4, Radio 2 and the World Service have included programmes devoted to Sherlock Holmes, Jack the Ripper, Robin Hood, Dracula, Peter Pan, Winnie-the-Pooh, Alice in Wonderland and the life and work of Ambrose Bierce, Robert Raikes, Harry Houdini, Terry Pratchett, George Orwell, Roald Dahl, Ray Bradbury, Richmal Crompton, Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Jim Henson, Paco Pena, James Galway, Marcel Marceau, Bob Hoskins and Julie Andrews.

Key series for BBC Radio 2, made in collaboration with producer Malcolm Prince, include &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mickey Mouse Business&quot;, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Women&quot;, &quot;David Puttnam&#x27;s Century of Cinema&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mickey Mouse Music&quot;, &quot;No Place Life Home: A Judy Garland Story&quot;, &quot;Showman and Starmaker: A Tribute to Bill Cotton&quot; and, in Autumn 2010, a series of eight documentaries on aspects of &quot;The Musical&quot; that he both compiled and wrote. His interviewees for these series included Michael Caine, Richard Attenborough, Angela Lansbury, Margaret O&#x27;Brien, Dirk Bogarde, Roy E Disney, Robert Wise, Ken Annakin, Richard Curtis, Richard M Sherman, Leslie Briccusse, Bryan Forbes, Sandy Wilson, Tim Rice, James Rado and Edward Albee. He also wrote and presented a series on the history of film music, &quot;The Sound of Movies&quot;.

Sibley&#x27;s book, &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, was serialized on Radio 2, read by Ian Richardson in what was one of the actor&#x27;s last pieces of broadcast work.

Gillian Reynolds, then &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; radio critic, gave him the accolade &quot;magician of the airwaves&quot;.

In 1992 Sibley wrote much of the script for &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of Spartacus&quot;.

The author of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Making of the Movie Trilogy&quot; and other books accompanying &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, he subsequently wrote the official biography of the films&#x27; director, &quot;Peter Jackson: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Journey&quot;.

In October 2016 he was one of four writers contributing new stories about Winnie-the-Pooh for a 90th birthday collection, &quot;The Best Bear in All the World&quot;. His story introduced a new character, Penguin, inspired by a vintage photograph of A. A. Milne and his young son, Christopher Robin, playing with the original teddy bear who became Winnie-the-Pooh and a plush toy penguin. The same month saw the publication of Taschen Books&#x27; &quot;The Walt Disney Film Archives. The Animated Movies 1921–1968&quot; to which he contributed five critical essays on Disney films.

His Christmas book, &quot;Joseph and the Three Gifts&quot;, published in September 2019, was described by Frank Cottrell Boyce as &quot;a little masterpiece&quot;. The book was abridged and serialised (by the author) for broadcast in the Christmas week of 2021 on BBC Radio 4, where it was read by Alex Jennings and directed by Martin Jarvis.

In 2021, his fable &quot;Osric the Extraordinary Owl&quot;, illustrated by his friend Pauline Baynes, was privately published in a limited edition. He is currently editing a book of the letters of Walt Disney.

Sibley recorded DVD audio commentaries for &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956 film), &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (1954 film) and &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940 film). He has also appeared on the bonus extras to a number of Disney Blu-rays and DVDs, among them &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot; as well as being included in the documentaries associated with various home media releases of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy.

Sibley is also the editor of The Sunday Times Best-seller, J.R.R.Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of Númenor&quot; (2022), illustrated by Alan Lee and the winner of the Tolkien Society&#x27;s &#x27;Best Book of 2023&#x27; award.

<doc id="295190" wikidata="Q1262485" url="?curid=295190" title="Treaty of Rome (1924)">
<text>The Treaty of Rome was agreed on 27 January 1924, when Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes agreed that Fiume would be annexed to Italy as the Province of Fiume, and the town of Sušak would be part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

Fiume and Sušak would have a joint administration of the port facilities. Both towns are now in the city of Rijeka, Croatia.

==Background==
After Fiume was under Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio&#x27;s Italian Regency of Carnaro, the Treaty of Rapallo (1920) created the independent Free State of Fiume, which was immediately recognised by other states, including the United States, France and the United Kingdom. The state survived only one year &quot;de facto&quot; and four years &quot;de jure&quot;. The joint administration of the port was never created.

On 24 April 1921, the first general elections for its parliament occurred, and it elected President Riccardo Zanella, the leader of the Autonomist Fiuman Movement. On 3 March 1922, a movement directed by the fascist deputy Francesco Giunta forced Zanella to resign. On 17 September 1923, Gaetano Giardino, an Italian general, was sent by Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini with the task of restoring public order. In the meantime, negotiations started between Italy and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to dissolve the Free State of Fiume.

All parties ratified the agreement in Rome on 22 February 1924, and it became effective the same day. It was registered in the &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on 7 April 1924.

== Terms ==
The Treaty of Rome revoked parts of the Treaty of Rapallo. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes asserted its sovereignty over the delta of the Rječina River, including the seaport of Sušak (Porto Barros) and the north of Fiume County. Italy was given the city of Fiume, some surrounding land and a coastal corridor to connect it to the Italian mainland.

==Aftermath==
The exact definition of the borders were the object of a joint commission, whose results were agreed upon on 20 July 1925 in the Treaty of Nettuno.

Following the upheaval of the Second World War, Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia annexed Fiume, putting an end to the provisions of the Treaty of Rome.

Nowadays, its former territory roughly corresponds to Primorje-Gorski Kotar County in Croatia.

<doc id="295192" wikidata="Q231871" url="?curid=295192" title="Archduchess Gisela of Austria">
<text>Archduchess Gisela Louise Marie of Austria (12 July 1856 – 27 July 1932) was the second daughter and eldest surviving child of Emperor Franz Joseph I and Empress Elisabeth of Austria. She became a Princess of Bavaria through her marriage to her second cousin, Leopold. 

The Archduchess was born on 12 July 1856, the second child of Franz Joseph I of Austria and Elisabeth in Bavaria. She was named Gisella Louise Marie; the name Gisella was taken after Queen Gisela of Hungary, wife of Stephen I, first Christian Hungarian king. Although christened &quot;Gisella&quot;, she only ever wrote her name with one L. Just like her elder sister Archduchess Sophie and her brother Crown Prince Rudolf, Gisela was raised by her paternal grandmother, Archduchess Sophie of Austria. Of a sober nature like her father, she kept a reserved attitude towards her mother. She had a very close relationship with her brother, whose suicide affected her greatly.

== Life ==
Her father collected some of the family&#x27;s personal items, such as the first pair of shoes worn by each of his children. Among these keepsakes was a poem written for him by a young Gisela one Christmas; the poem was said to be the most treasured item among this collection. Archduchess Gisela was also known to paint in her later years.

== Marriage and family ==
On 20 April 1873, at the age of 16, Gisela was married to Prince Leopold of Bavaria in Vienna. Prince Leopold was a son of Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria and Auguste Ferdinande of Austria: Gisela&#x27;s second cousin. Leopold had initially fallen for Princess Amalie of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, whom Empress Elisabeth&#x27;s younger brother Duke Maximilian Emanuel in Bavaria intended to marry. The Empress therefore arranged an encounter of Leopold and Gisela at Gödöllő Palace, and the prince knew he could not refuse her offer.

According to a letter to his mother written in 1872, Emperor Franz Josef wanted the match between his daughter and the Wittelsbach prince, as there were so few Catholic princes available at that time. It seems he felt he had to secure the only viable candidate to whom he could give Gisela (whom he called &quot;our darling girl&quot; during the wedding rites) with confidence. Prince Leopold received the immense dowry of a half a million guilders and soon overcame his former infatuation with Princess Amalie.

Gisela&#x27;s mother remained absent during the wedding celebrations. The young couple was made welcome in Munich by her husband&#x27;s family and went on to live in the Palais Leopold residence in Schwabing. The Palais was renamed &quot;Giselastraße&quot; in her honor in 1873.

=== Children ===

A year after her wedding, she gave birth to her first child and Empress Elisabeth attended the baptism. Gisela and Leopold had four children:
* Princess Elisabeth Marie of Bavaria (8 January 1874 – 4 March 1957), who married Count Otto Ludwig Philipp von Seefried auf Buttenheim
* Princess Auguste Maria of Bavaria (28 April 1875 – 25 June 1964), who married Joseph August, Archduke of Austria
* Prince Georg of Bavaria (2 April 1880 – 31 May 1943), who married Archduchess Isabella of Austria
* Prince Konrad of Bavaria (22 November 1883 – 6 September 1969), who married Princess Bona Margherita of Savoy-Genoa

== Charity works and World War I ==
Especially after the death of her brother, Gisela was deeply involved in a variety of social and political issues and founded charities to support the poor, blind, and deaf people where she took an active role herself. During World War I she ran a military hospital in her Palais while her husband was a field marshal on the eastern front. When the Revolution broke out in 1918, the rest of her family fled the city, but Gisela remained and took part in the 1919 elections for the Weimar National Assembly where women above the age of 20 were allowed to vote for the first time.

Such was the esteem in which she was held that she was commonly known as the &quot;Good Angel from Vienna&quot; and became patron for a number of institutions, such as the Giselabahn (a train running from Salzburg to Tirol), the still active paddle steamer &quot;Gisela&quot; on the Traunsee and the Gisela Gymnasium in Munich.

== Widowhood and death ==
Gisela and her husband celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1923. Her husband died in 1930; Gisela only survived him by two years. She died aged 76 in Munich on 27 July 1932, and is buried next to Prince Leopold in the &quot;Colombarium&quot; at the St.Michaelskirche, Munich.

==Honours ==
She received the following orders:
** Dame of the Order of the Starry Cross
** Grand Cross of the Order of Elizabeth, &quot;1898&quot;
** Dame of the Order of Theresa
** Dame of the Order of Saint Elizabeth
* : Dame of the Order of Saint Isabel
* Spain: 601st Dame of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa, &quot;29 January 1863&quot;

<text>Felician University is a private Catholic university with two campuses in the U.S. state of New Jersey, one in Lodi and one in Rutherford. In 2016–17 enrollment was 1,996, with undergraduates comprising around 1,626 students; 21 percent were men and 79 percent were women.
== History ==

It was founded as the Immaculate Conception Normal School by the Felician Sisters in 1923 and the school has changed names several times in its history, most recently in 2015 to Felician University. 

In June 2015, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) censured Felician College for terminating the services of several faculty members without adequate explanation, adequate notice, or an opportunity for review.
==Campuses==

Located from New York City, Felician University has two locations in Bergen County, New Jersey, in the towns of Lodi and Rutherford. These campuses are about apart, with regular shuttle service running between them throughout the day and evening hours. The Rutherford campus also has a gymnasium and a late-night coffee shop and game room.

The Lodi campus library occupies an International Style building and houses print collections, sound recordings, and visual media in digital format. Three levels contain an information commons, reading room, book stacks, spaces for group as well as quiet study, and two computer laboratories. Its more than 115,000 books, 360 print periodicals, 20,000 online journals, 43,000 electronic books, and 80,000 microforms offer strong historical and current perspectives in support of the curriculum. The library also provides a broad selection of online resources, of which are accessible on the campus computer network, as well as off-campus with a college network ID and password. The Curriculum Materials Library and Technology Center, located in Sammartino Hall on the Rutherford campus, collects children&#x27;s literature, textbooks, curriculum guides, periodicals, and other instructional materials suitable for use in the classroom. An active information literacy instruction program through library liaisons begins with the Freshmen Year Experience program.

==Accreditation==
The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Specialized accreditation also exists for the nursing and teaching programs:
* Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education:
** Nursing (CNURED) – nursing education programs at the baccalaureate degree levels 4/28/1998
** Nursing (CNURED) – nursing education programs at the graduate degree levels 4/28/1998

<doc id="295194" wikidata="Q5548482" url="?curid=295194" title="Georgi–Glashow model">
<text>In particle physics, the Georgi–Glashow model is a particular Grand Unified Theory (GUT) proposed by Howard Georgi and Sheldon Glashow in 1974. In this model, the Standard Model gauge groups SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) are combined into a single simple gauge group SU(5). The unified group SU(5) is then thought to be spontaneously broken into the Standard Model subgroup below a very high energy scale called the grand unification scale.

Since the Georgi–Glashow model combines leptons and quarks into single irreducible representations, there exist interactions which do not conserve baryon number, although they still conserve the quantum number  associated with the symmetry of the common representation. This yields a mechanism for proton decay, and the rate of proton decay can be predicted from the dynamics of the model. However, proton decay has not yet been observed experimentally, and the resulting lower limit on the lifetime of the proton contradicts the predictions of this model. Nevertheless, the elegance of the model has led particle physicists to use it as the foundation for more complex models which yield longer proton lifetimes, particularly SO(10) in basic and SUSY variants.

(For a more elementary introduction to how the representation theory of Lie algebras are related to particle physics, see the article Particle physics and representation theory.)

Also, this model suffers from the doublet–triplet splitting problem.

==Construction==

SU(5) acts on formula_1 and hence on its exterior algebra formula_2. Choosing a formula_3 splitting restricts SU(5) to , yielding matrices of the form

:formula_4

with kernel formula_5, hence isomorphic to the Standard Model&#x27;s true gauge group formula_6. For the zeroth power formula_7, this acts trivially to match a left-handed neutrino, formula_8. For the first exterior power formula_9, the Standard Model&#x27;s group action preserves the splitting formula_10. The formula_11 transforms trivially in , as a doublet in , and under the representation of (as weak hypercharge is conventionally normalized as ); this matches a right-handed anti-lepton, formula_12 (as formula_13 in SU(2)). The formula_14 transforms as a triplet in SU(3), a singlet in SU(2), and under the Y = − representation of U(1) (as ); this matches a right-handed down quark, formula_15.

The second power formula_16 is obtained via the formula formula_17. As SU(5) preserves the canonical volume form of formula_1, Hodge duals give the upper three powers by formula_19. Thus the Standard Model&#x27;s representation of one generation of fermions and antifermions lies within formula_2.

Similar motivations apply to the Pati–Salam model, and to SO(10), E6, and other supergroups of SU(5).

==Explicit Embedding of the Standard Model (SM)==
Owing to its relatively simple gauge group formula_21 , GUTs can be written in terms of vectors and matrices which allows for an intuitive understanding of the Georgi–Glashow model. The fermion sector is then composed of an anti fundamental formula_22 and an antisymmetric formula_23. In terms of SM degrees of freedoms, this can be written as
:formula_24
and
:formula_25
with formula_26 and formula_27 the left-handed up and down type quark, formula_28 and formula_29 their righthanded counterparts, formula_30 the neutrino, formula_31 and formula_32 the left and right-handed electron, respectively.

In addition to the fermions, we need to break formula_33; this is achieved in the Georgi–Glashow model via a fundamental formula_34 which contains the SM Higgs,
:formula_35
with formula_36 and formula_37 the charged and neutral components of the SM Higgs, respectively. Note that the formula_38 are not SM particles and are thus a prediction of the Georgi–Glashow model.

The SM gauge fields can be embedded explicitly as well. For that we recall a gauge field transforms as an adjoint, and thus can be written as formula_39 with formula_40 the formula_41 generators. Now, if we restrict ourselves to generators with non-zero entries only in the upper formula_42 block, in the lower formula_43 block, or on the diagonal, we can identify 
:formula_44
with the formula_45 colour gauge fields,
:formula_46 
with the weak formula_47 fields, and 
:formula_48
with the formula_49 hypercharge (up to some normalization formula_50.)
Using the embedding, we can explicitly check that the fermionic fields transform as they should.

This explicit embedding can be found in Ref. or in the original paper by Georgi and Glashow.

==Breaking SU(5)==
SU(5) breaking occurs when a scalar field (Which we will denote as formula_51), analogous to the Higgs field and transforming in the adjoint of SU(5), acquires a vacuum expectation value (vev) proportional to the weak hypercharge generator 
:formula_52.
When this occurs, SU(5) is spontaneously broken to the subgroup of SU(5) commuting with the group generated by &quot;Y&quot;.

Using the embedding from the previous section, we can explicitly check that formula_41 is indeed equal to formula_54 by noting that formula_55. Computation of similar commutators further shows that all other formula_41 gauge fields acquire masses.
To be precise, the unbroken subgroup is actually
:formula_57

Under this unbroken subgroup, the adjoint 24 transforms as
:formula_58
to yield the gauge bosons of the Standard Model plus the new X and Y bosons. See restricted representation.

The Standard Model&#x27;s quarks and leptons fit neatly into representations of SU(5). Specifically, the left-handed fermions combine into 3 generations of formula_59 Under the unbroken subgroup these transform as
:formula_60 
to yield precisely the left-handed fermionic content of the Standard Model where every generation , , , and correspond to anti-down-type quark, anti-up-type quark, anti-down-type lepton, and anti-up-type lepton, respectively. Also, and formula_61 correspond to quark and lepton. Fermions transforming as 1 under SU(5) are now thought to be necessary because of the evidence for neutrino oscillations, unless a way is found to introduce an infinitesimal Majorana coupling for the left-handed neutrinos.

Since the homotopy group is
:formula_62,
this model predicts &#x27;t Hooft–Polyakov monopoles.

Because the electromagnetic charge is a linear combination of some SU(2) generator with , these monopoles also have quantized magnetic charges , where by &quot;magnetic&quot;, here we mean magnetic electromagnetic charges.

==Minimal supersymmetric SU(5)==
The minimal supersymmetric SU(5) model assigns a formula_63 matter parity to the chiral superfields with the matter fields having odd parity and the Higgs having even parity to protect the electroweak Higgs from quadratic radiative mass corrections (the hierarchy problem). In the non-supersymmetric version the action is invariant under a similar formula_63 symmetry because the matter fields are all fermionic and thus must appear in the action in pairs, while the Higgs fields are bosonic.

===Chiral superfields===
As complex representations:

===Superpotential===
A generic invariant renormalizable superpotential is a (complex) formula_65 invariant cubic polynomial in the superfields. It is a linear combination of the following terms:

:formula_66

The first column is an Abbreviation of the second column (neglecting proper normalization factors), where capital indices are SU(5) indices, and and are the generation indices.

The last two rows presupposes the multiplicity of formula_67 is not zero (i.e. that a sterile neutrino exists). The coupling formula_68 has coefficients which are symmetric in and . The coupling formula_69 has coefficients which are symmetric in and . The number of sterile neutrino generations need not be three, unless the SU(5) is embedded in a higher unification scheme such as SO(10).

===Vacua===
The vacua correspond to the mutual zeros of the and terms. Let&#x27;s first look at the case where the VEVs of all the chiral fields are zero except for .

====The sector====
:formula_70

The zeros corresponds to finding the stationary points of subject to the traceless constraint formula_71 So, formula_72 where is a Lagrange multiplier.

Up to an SU(5) (unitary) transformation,

:formula_73

The three cases are called case I, II, and III and they break the gauge symmetry into formula_74 and formula_75 respectively (the stabilizer of the VEV).

In other words, there are at least three different superselection sections, which is typical for supersymmetric theories.

Only case III makes any sense and so, we will focus on this case from now onwards.

It can be verified that this solution together with zero VEVs for all the other chiral multiplets is a zero of the F-terms and D-terms. The matter parity remains unbroken (right up to the TeV scale).

====Decomposition====
The gauge algebra 24 decomposes as

: formula_76

This 24 is a real representation, so the last two terms need explanation. Both formula_77 and formula_78 are complex representations. However, the direct sum of both representation decomposes into two irreducible real representations and we only take half of the direct sum, i.e. one of the two real irreducible copies. The first three components are left unbroken. The adjoint Higgs also has a similar decomposition, except that it is complex. The Higgs mechanism causes one real HALF of the formula_79 and formula_78 of the adjoint Higgs to be absorbed. The other real half acquires a mass coming from the D-terms. And the other three components of the adjoint Higgs, formula_81 and formula_82 acquire GUT scale masses coming from self pairings of the superpotential, formula_83

The sterile neutrinos, if any exist, would also acquire a GUT scale Majorana mass coming from the superpotential coupling  .

Because of matter parity, the matter representations formula_84 and 10 remain chiral.

It is the Higgs fields 5 and formula_85 which are interesting.

The two relevant superpotential terms here are formula_86 and formula_87 Unless there happens to be some fine tuning, we would expect both the triplet terms and the doublet terms to pair up, leaving us with no light electroweak doublets. This is in complete disagreement with phenomenology. See doublet-triplet splitting problem for more details.

====Fermion masses====
==Problems of the Georgi–Glashow model==
===Proton decay in SU(5)===
Unification of the Standard Model via an SU(5) group has significant phenomenological implications. Most notable of these is proton decay which is present in SU(5) with and without supersymmetry. This is allowed by the new vector bosons introduced from the adjoint representation of SU(5) which also contains the gauge bosons of the Standard Model forces. Since these new gauge bosons are in (3,2)−5/6 bifundamental representations, they violated baryon and lepton number. As a result, the new operators should cause protons to decay at a rate inversely proportional to their masses. This process is called dimension 6 proton decay and is an issue for the model, since the proton is experimentally determined to have a lifetime greater than the age of the universe. This means that an SU(5) model is severely constrained by this process.

As well as these new gauge bosons, in SU(5) models, the Higgs field is usually embedded in a 5 representation of the GUT group. The caveat of this is that since the Higgs field is an SU(2) doublet, the remaining part, an SU(3) triplet, must be some new field - usually called D or T. This new scalar would be able to generate proton decay as well and, assuming the most basic Higgs vacuum alignment, would be massless so allowing the process at very high rates.

While not an issue in the Georgi–Glashow model, a supersymmeterised SU(5) model would have additional proton decay operators due to the superpartners of the Standard Model fermions. The lack of detection of proton decay (in any form) brings into question the veracity of SU(5) GUTs of all types; however, while the models are highly constrained by this result, they are not in general ruled out.

==== Mechanism ====

In the lowest-order Feynman diagram corresponding to the simplest source of proton decay in SU(5), a left-handed and a right-handed up quark annihilate yielding an X+ boson which decays to a right-handed (or left-handed) positron and a left-handed (or right-handed) anti-down quark:

:formula_88

:formula_89

This process conserves weak isospin, weak hypercharge, and color. GUTs equate anti-color with having two colors, formula_90 and SU(5) defines left-handed normal leptons as &quot;white&quot; and right-handed antileptons as &quot;black&quot;. The first vertex only involves fermions of the representation, while the second only involves fermions in the (or ), demonstrating the preservation of SU(5) symmetry.

===Mass relations===
Since SM states are regrouped into formula_41 representations their Yukawa matrices have the following relations:

:formula_92

In particular this predicts formula_93 at energies close to the scale of unification. This is however not realized in nature.

===Doublet-triplet splitting===

As mentioned in the above section the colour triplet of the formula_94 which contains the SM Higgs can mediate dimension 6 proton decay. Since protons seem to be quite stable such a triplet has to acquire a quite large mass in order to suppress the decay. This is however problematic. For that consider the scalar part of the Greorgi-Glashow Lagrangian:
:formula_95
We here have denoted the adjoint used to break formula_96 to the SM with formula_97 is VEV by formula_98 and formula_99 the defining representation. which contains the SM Higgs formula_100 and the colour triplet formula_101 which can induce proton decay. As mentioned, we require formula_102 in order to sufficiently suppress proton decay. On the other hand, the formula_103 is typically of order formula_104 in order to be consistent with observations. Looking at the above equation it becomes clear that one has to be very precise in choosing the parameters formula_105 and formula_106 any two random parameters will not do, since then formula_103 and formula_108 could be of the same order!

This is known as the doublet–triplet (DT) splitting problem: In order to be consistent we have to &#x27;split&#x27; the &#x27;masses&#x27; of formula_109 and formula_110 but for that we need to fine-tune formula_105 and formula_112There are however some solutions to this problem (see e.g.) which can work quite well in SUSY models.

A review of the DT splitting problem can be found in.

===Neutrino masses===

As the SM the original Georgi–Glashow model proposed in does not include neutrino masses. However, since neutrino oscillation has been observed such masses are required. The solutions to this problem follow the same ideas which have been applied to the SM: One on hand on can include a formula_41 singulet which then can generate either Dirac masses or Majorana masses. As in the SM one can also implement the type-I seesaw mechanism which then generates naturally light masses.

On the other hand, one can just parametrize the ignorance about neutrinos using the dimension 5 Weinbergoperator:
:formula_114
with formula_115 the formula_116 Yukawa matrix required for the mixing between flavours.

<text>Archduchess Sophie of Austria (5 March 185529 May 1857) was the first child of Emperor Franz Joseph I and Empress Elisabeth of Austria. She died aged two.

==Life==
Within two months of her marriage to Franz Joseph, Elisabeth was pregnant. On 5 March 1855, the 17-year-old Empress of Austria delivered a daughter who was christened the same day, without Elisabeth&#x27;s knowledge, &quot;Sophie Friederike Dorothea Maria Josepha&quot;, after Franz Joseph&#x27;s mother. On both her mother and her father&#x27;s side, Sophie descended from King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, as her parents were first cousins. On her father&#x27;s side, she descended from the last Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II. During the next year, Elisabeth delivered another daughter, Archduchess Gisela, a younger sister to Sophie. Although they were both girls and did not need to be educated for duties a monarch would be obliged to fulfill, both infants right after being baptised were taken away from Elisabeth by Archduchess Sophie (who was both Elisabeth&#x27;s aunt and mother-in-law) on account of the Empress being too young to raise two children. Elisabeth later commented:

No matter how long Elisabeth begged Franz Joseph to discuss the matter with his mother, her cries went unheard. Eventually, Franz Joseph did discuss the problem with his mother and Elisabeth eventually began to openly express her wishes to her mother-in-law and even took the little girls with her as she travelled.

==Death==

Empress Elisabeth adored Hungary and its people and proposed to her husband that they take a trip to her favourite country, perhaps even tour it. Franz Joseph accepted and they left in early spring 1857. While in Buda, both Sophie and her sister Archduchess Gisela fell ill with diarrhea and had a very high fever. 10-month-old Gisela recovered quickly. However, two-year-old Sophie died in her mother&#x27;s arms at : in the evening, after eleven hours of struggling to survive, probably from dehydration due to the diarrhea or from convulsions due to the high fever. It was later theorized that Sophie died from typhoid fever, but this is yet to be proven.

==Aftermath==
Sophie&#x27;s body was brought back to Vienna and buried in the Imperial Crypt, in &quot;Ferdinand&#x27;s Vault&quot; within the southwest pier.

The death of her oldest child would haunt Empress Elisabeth for her entire life. Elisabeth was held indirectly responsible for Sophie&#x27;s death by her mother-in-law Archduchess Sophie (née Princess Sophie of Bavaria). She suffered a breakdown and would lock herself in her apartments for days at a time or go riding until she reached a state of exhaustion, just to avoid having to think. Sophie&#x27;s death also settled who got the children. Princess Sophie took the children, without opposition, as soon as they were born. Elisabeth also started to neglect her surviving daughter, and their relationship was not a close one. One of Elisabeth&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting, Marie Festetics, commented in her diary that the Empress did not even take the time to attend Gisela&#x27;s wedding preparations. Elisabeth also behaved in a similar manner to her only son, Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria. For the rest of her remaining days, Elisabeth would wear a bracelet with a likeness of her dead daughter and kept a portrait of her in her apartments.

<text>Felice Gimondi (; 29 September 1942 – 16 August 2019) was an Italian professional racing cyclist. With his 1968 victory at the Vuelta a España, only three years after becoming a professional cyclist, Gimondi, nicknamed &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, was the second cyclist (after Jacques Anquetil) to win all three &quot;Grand Tours&quot; of road cycling: Tour de France (1965, his first year as a pro), Giro d&#x27;Italia (1967, 1969 and 1976), and Vuelta a España (1968). He is one of only seven cyclists to have done so.

Gimondi also won three of the five Cycling monuments, winning the Giro di Lombardia twice, and finished on the podium of a grand tour twelve times.

He accomplished all of these major victories despite his career coinciding with that of Eddy Merckx.

==Biography==

Gimondi was born on 29 September 1942 in Sedrina in the Province of Bergamo. He was the son of a transport manager and a post mistress. In his youth, he frequently took his mother&#x27;s post bicycle and later helped to deliver mail on it. In 1964, Gimondi rode the road race at the 1964 Olympic Games, where he finished in 33rd place. After winning the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir, he was signed, in 1965, as a professional to the Salvarani team. With the withdrawal of another cyclist from Salvarani&#x27;s 1965 Tour de France team, Gimondi was added at the last minute and later recalled that he had to ask his mother for permission to start the race. He took the yellow jersey on stage 3, but lost the race lead later when he waited for his nominal team captain Vittorio Adorni. Adorni later dropped out, leaving Gimondi to fight out the overall victory with Raymond Poulidor, securing the Tour in the final time trial.

His early successes led to him being regarded as a successor to well-renowned fellow Italian Fausto Coppi, nicknamed &quot;campionissimo&quot;. Gimondi&#x27;s career coincided for the most part with that of highly-successful Eddy Merckx. However, Gimondi was able to build up a respectable &quot;palmarès&quot; himself, even through the era of Merckx&#x27; dominance.

After winning the 1967 Giro d&#x27;Italia and the 1968 Vuelta a España, Gimondi had become the second-ever rider to have won all three Grand Tours after Jacques Anquetil. He won the Giro a further two times, first in 1969. In 1976, Gimondi was not counted among the favourites, being regarded as past his prime, but overcame a deficit on race leader Johan De Muynck in the final time trial to take his third victory in the race. His success was subsequently called the &quot;miracle in Milan&quot;.

His other successes include four victories in the so-called &quot;monument classics&quot;, winning Paris–Roubaix in 1966, Milan–San Remo in 1974 and the Giro di Lombardia twice (1966 and 1973). In the 1973 World Championship road race, he formed a group with Luis Ocaña and Freddy Maertens to bridge a gap to Merckx, who had attacked earlier. At the finish, he outsprinted Maertens to clinch the title. He had already placed third in 1970 and second in 1971. Gimondi also won Paris–Brussels twice, in 1966 and 1976.

He failed twice to pass doping controls, first in the 1968 Giro d&#x27;Italia and then at the 1975 Tour de France. His positive test at the 1968 Giro was for the stimulant Fencamfamin, but since the substance was not on the prohibited list at the time, he kept his third place overall at the race. At the 1975 Tour, he received a 10-minute time penalty.
A major cyclosportive event is named in his honour, the Gran Fondo Felice Gimondi, held annually around Bergamo. Since 2019, it honours all seven riders to have won all three Grand Tours.

Throughout his career and after it, Gimondi was closely associated with the bicycle manufacturer Bianchi. In the late 1980s, Gimondi was briefly &quot;directeur sportif&quot; at the Gewiss–Bianchi team. He served as manager for Bianchi&#x27;s mountain-bike team for a long period of time. Between 2000 and 2001, Gimondi briefly worked as president of the team and as an advisor to Marco Pantani. At the end of the 1998 Tour de France, race organiser Jean-Marie Leblanc invited Gimondi onto the stage during the podium celebration, when Pantani became the first Italian winner of the race since he had himself won the event in 1965. In 2008, Gimondi was the president of the TX Active – Bianchi cycling team which specializes in MTB races.

In 1968, Gimondi married Tiziana Bersano, with whom he had two daughters, Norma and Federica.

Gimondi died on 16 August 2019 after suffering a heart attack while swimming on vacation in Sicily. He was 76. His funeral was held on 20 August in Paladina near Bergamo, attended by thousands of people.

<doc id="295197" wikidata="Q234002" url="?curid=295197" title="Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria">
<text>Archduchess Marie Valerie Mathilde Amalie of Austria (22 April 1868 – 6 September 1924) was the youngest child of Emperor Franz Joseph I and Empress Elisabeth of Austria. She was usually called Valerie.

On 31 July 1890, she married Archduke Franz Salvator of Austria; the marriage caused a rift between her and her siblings as their marriages had to be dynastic, while Marie Valerie&#x27;s was, as Empress Elisabeth allowed, for love and desire.

==Early life==
Archduchess Marie Valerie was born on 22 April 1868 in Buda, Hungary to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and his wife, Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria. She had an older sister, Archduchess Gisela, and an older brother, Crown Prince Rudolf. Her eldest sibling, Archduchess Sophie had already died by the time she was born. Her mother was especially attached to Valerie, who was born ten years after the imperial couple&#x27;s third child, and whom Elisabeth was allowed to raise herself while her first three children were taken from her in infancy and raised by the Emperor&#x27;s mother, Archduchess Sophie. Sophie herself wrote to Elisabeth&#x27;s mother, Duchess Ludovika in Bavaria, &quot;Sisi is completely absorbed by her love and care for this irresistible little angel.&quot;

She was Elisabeth&#x27;s favorite child by far, and was acidly referred to by some courtiers as &quot;die Einzige&quot; (&quot;the only one&quot;) because Elisabeth paid so much more attention to her than to her siblings. Valerie loved her mother, but according to her diaries, she often felt embarrassed and overwhelmed by Elisabeth&#x27;s concentration on her, particularly as she was modest and practical.

Another of Valerie&#x27;s nicknames was &quot;the Hungarian child&quot;, as her birth had been a concession by Elisabeth, who disliked physical intimacy and pregnancy, in exchange for Franz Joseph&#x27;s reconciliation with Hungary, her most favored part of the Empire. This process culminated in their joint coronation in Buda on 8 June 1867 as King and Queen of Hungary. Valerie was born a little over nine months later.

Elisabeth deliberately chose Hungary as her child&#x27;s birthplace; no royal child had been born in Hungary for centuries. Had Valerie been a boy, she would have been named Stephen after Hungary&#x27;s canonized King and patron saint. According to historian Brigitte Hamann, a boy born to the Queen of Hungary in the castle at Budapest would have raised the possibility of his someday becoming its king, separating Hungary from the Austrian empire. Due to this, there was universal relief at the Viennese court that Valerie was a girl. 

Malicious rumors began to spread that Valerie was in truth the daughter of Elisabeth&#x27;s friend and admirer Gyula Andrássy, the Hungarian prime minister. These persisted into Valerie&#x27;s childhood, hurting her deeply. However, she physically resembled Franz Joseph more than any of her siblings, even more so as she grew older, and eventually the hearsay stopped. Due to the atmosphere they created, Valerie developed a lifelong antipathy toward anything to do with Hungary, exacerbated by Elisabeth&#x27;s insistence on speaking to her only in Hungarian. She was joyful when she was given permission to speak German with her father, whom she worshipped. In addition, she spoke English, French, and Italian fluently. She loved to write plays and poems, and was a talented amateur artist who particularly enjoyed painting flowers. She was a great supporter of the Burgtheater in Vienna, and attended its productions as often as possible.

==Marriage==

In Bad Ischl on 31 July 1890, Valerie married her third cousin Archduke Franz Salvator. They had met in 1886 at a ball, but Valerie waited several years to be sure that her feelings toward Franz Salvator were strong enough for a successful marriage. It was hoped by many at court that she would marry someone like the Crown Prince of Saxony, the Prince Royal of Portugal or Prince Alfons of Bavaria as she courted with him. Nonetheless, Empress Elisabeth declared that Valerie would be allowed to marry even a chimney sweep if she so desired (in contrast to her other children, who both had to make dynastic marriages). Valerie chose Franz Salvator, a relatively minor prince from the Tuscan branch of the Austrian imperial family who had no great wealth to offer, and Elisabeth, as promised, supported her favorite daughter. This caused a deep rift between Valerie and her siblings for a time, but eventually Rudolf reconciled with her when Valerie and Franz became engaged on Christmas 1888. However, the relationship between Valerie and Rudolf&#x27;s wife Princess Stéphanie of Belgium remained cold even after Rudolf&#x27;s death.

Valerie&#x27;s solemn renunciation of her rights to the Austrian throne, which was necessary for the marriage to proceed, took place on 16 July 1890 at the Hermesvilla. The young couple&#x27;s festive wedding followed in the parish church of Bad Ischl on 31 July. The ceremony was conducted by the Bishop of Linz, Franz Maria Doppelbauer. Afterwards, Valerie and Franz honeymooned in Italy, Switzerland and Bavaria.

===Children===
Marie Valerie and Franz Salvator had 10 children:

==Later life==
At first, Valerie and Franz lived at the Schloss Lichtenegg. Though on 11 June 1895, the couple purchased Schloss Wallsee on the Danube River from its then owner, Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and completely renovated it. When the renovation was finished, a ceremony marking their moving into the new palace was held on 4 September 1897. There was great celebration of the event in Wallsee due to Valerie&#x27;s popularity. Even after her marriage, Marie Valerie remained in close contact with her ageing father, who greatly appreciated the informal atmosphere in his youngest daughter&#x27;s family.

She was known and loved for her generous involvement in local charitable endeavors. In 1900, she became a patron of the Red Cross, for which she founded hospitals and raised considerable sums of money; she was also patron of seven other charities. During World War I she created a hospital barracks in the castle itself and helped care for the wounded. She was a devout Catholic who also spent much time supporting religious charities and was known to the people as the &quot;Angel of Waldsee&quot;. She was also a Dame of the Star Cross Order.

Valerie was greatly affected by the suicide of her brother Rudolf on 30 January 1889, and the assassination of her mother Elisabeth in September 1898. She and her sister Gisela were a great support to their father in the aftermath of these tragedies. Together with Elisabeth&#x27;s ladies-in-waiting Valerie also sorted out Elisabeth&#x27;s literary legacy, her letters and correspondences. In her diary Valerie noted that her parents&#x27; relationship and alienation had only improved during the last few years of her mother&#x27;s life. She also felt that taking care of her aging father, Emperor Franz Joseph, was some sort of &quot;a trial&quot;.

While the marriage of Valerie and Franz was harmonious at first, it became less so with time. Franz had many affairs, including one with a dancer Stephanie Richter, who was later known as &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Spy Princess&quot; for her espionage activities before and during World War II. In 1914, she gave birth to a son by him, Franz Joseph, whom he acknowledged as his while Valerie was still alive. Valerie faced these blows stoically, confiding only in her journal.

After the end of World War I, Valerie officially recognized the end of the Habsburg monarchy and signed documents renouncing all rights toward the same for herself and her descendants. The renunciation allowed her to keep her home and possessions.

==Death==
Valerie died in Schloss Wallsee on 6 September 1924 of lymphoma. Shortly before her death, her sister Gisela wrote in a letter, &quot;I must add that I have seen Valerie - fully conscious, completely aware of her condition, and so devoutly accepting, even joyfully anticipating her impending departure, that I believe an unexpected recovery would actually disappoint her.&quot; She is buried in a crypt behind the high altar at the parish church in Sindelburg, Austria. Several thousand people followed her coffin to its resting place.

On 28 April 1934, ten years after Valerie&#x27;s death, Franz married a second time, to Freiin (a title corresponding to &quot;Baroness&quot;) Melanie von Riesenfels. This was a morganatic marriage; the wedding took place in Vienna. The pair had met after Valerie&#x27;s death at Melanie&#x27;s home, Seisenegg Palace, where she lived with her sisters Maria Anna and Johanna. After their wedding, the couple lived at Seisenegg.

Franz Salvator died on 20 April 1939 in Vienna.

The Mária Valéria bridge joining Hungarian town Esztergom and Slovak town Štúrovo (then Parkány) across the river Danube was opened in 1895. It was named after Marie Valerie.

==Honours==
She received the following orders:
** Dame of the Order of the Starry Cross
** Grand Cross of the Order of Elizabeth, &quot;1898&quot;
** Dame of the Order of Saint Elizabeth
** Dame of the Order of Saint Isabel

<doc id="295198" wikidata="Q5548012" url="?curid=295198" title="Georgian Court University">
<text>Georgian Court University (GCU or Georgian Court) is a private Roman Catholic university in Lakewood Township, New Jersey. Founded in 1908 by the Sisters of Mercy, the university has more than 1,600 undergraduates and nearly 600 graduate students.

The institution became a university in 2004 and began admitting male students in 1994 after more than 100 years as a women&#x27;s college. The university is open to students of all faiths, while emphasizing its mission of Mercy, which incorporates respect, justice, integrity, compassion, and service.

The Lakewood campus (main campus) was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985.

==History==
=== Location ===
The main campus was built in 1899 on the former summer estate of the millionaire George Jay Gould, son of the railroad tycoon Jay Gould.
The Goulds named their home &quot;Georgian Court&quot;, probably after George or the Georgian-revival architecture.

The estate was designed by Bruce Price, a New York architect, and was one of his most important residential works. He also designed three of the campus&#x27;s gardens: the Italian Gardens, the Sunken Garden, and the Formal Garden. Takeo Shiota designed the Japanese Garden. In addition to the gardens, GCU has maintained much of the original architecture and the Sister Mary Grace Burns Arboretum. The estate was designated a National Historic Landmark for its architecture and its association with the Goulds.

In March 2022, GCU announced that it had reached an agreement to sell 42 acres of mostly unused land at the edge of its campus and several administrative buildings along Lakewood Avenue to Beth Medrash Govoha for an undisclosed sum. The proceeds of the sale will be used to construct a new center for nursing and health sciences, to reimagine its Casino building (currently used as a multi-purpose office and event space) as a modern student center, to update its Mansion building (currently used for receptions) to be used as an administration hub, and to modernize its student housing/dorm facilities.

=== School ===
The Sisters of Mercy founded Mount Saint Mary College as a liberal arts school for women in 1908, in North Plainfield, New Jersey. In 1924, the sisters purchased Georgian Court estate and moved the college there, renaming it Georgian Court College.

For more than a century, from 1908 to 2015, the institution was headed by Sisters of Mercy. The Sisters of Mercy organization continues to sponsor Georgian Court through the Conference for Mercy Higher Education.

The full transition to a coeducational institution, admitting both women and men into all academic programs, became complete at the outset of the Fall 2013 semester.

Georgian Court is the only Catholic college or university located in Central or South New Jersey. Most of its enrollment is drawn from these areas.

In 2004, university status was granted by the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education; the name was changed to Georgian Court University.

==Administration and faculty==
The first eight presidents (1908–2015) of the school were all Sisters of Mercy. The first male academic dean was appointed in 1967.

In 2015, Joseph R. Marbach, Ph.D., became the first permanent lay president — and the first male — to take the helm of Georgian Court University.

==Academics==
Georgian Court offers more than 35 undergraduate majors and 10 graduate majors through the School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Business and Digital Media, and the School of Education. In July 2021, the university formally created the Hackensack Meridian &quot;Health&quot; School of Nursing &amp; Wellness at Georgian Court to house its undergraduate and graduate nursing programs. Georgian Court University is nondiscriminatory and welcomes people of all faiths.

Beyond classes offered on the main campus in Lakewood, Georgian Court programs are also offered at GCU at Lincroft, New Jersey (at Brookdale Community College&#x27;s Northern Monmouth Campus), online and at other locations.

===Rankings===

In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Georgian Court No.95 out of 171 Regional Universities North.

===Undergraduate admissions===
In 2024, Georgian Court accepted 75.8% of undergraduate applicants, with those enrolled having an average 3.59 high school GPA. The university does not require submission of standardized test scores, Georgian Court being a test optional school. Those enrolled that submitted test scores had an average 1150 SAT score (3% submitting scores).

==Athletics==
The school colors are blue and gold, and the mascot is a lion. The Georgian Court University Lions have 14 sports teams that compete in the NCAA Division II.

The university is a member of the Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference (CACC).

GCU features a 67,000-square-foot Wellness Center equipped for athletic training, physical education and sports competitions. In addition, a 1,200-seat arena, athletics fields which offer synthetic turf, a six-court outdoor tennis center, and an abundance of training space offer student-athletes modern facilities and on-campus resources for their sports and recreational activities.

Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, track &amp; field, and volleyball.

As of fall of 2013, Georgian Court added men&#x27;s sports when it became fully coeducational, adding men&#x27;s basketball, cross country, soccer, and track &amp; field. Men&#x27;s lacrosse was added in the spring of 2016.

=== &quot;Real tennis&quot; ===

One of the many historic aspects of the campus is that it houses the only &quot;real tennis&quot; court at an American school. It was built in the Casino building (which was a &quot;casino&quot; in the 19th-century sense of the term: a place for social gatherings). Approximately forty-five real tennis courts are still in use in the world today.

<doc id="295200" wikidata="Q1357774" url="?curid=295200" title="Penglai, Yantai">
<text>Penglai, formerly known as Dengzhou or Tengchow, is a district of Yantai City, Shandong Peninsula in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It lies on the northwest corner of the Shandong Peninsula on the southern coast of the Gulf of Bohai. Penglai is famous for its mirages out at sea, which are frequent during May and June. Formerly a county-level city under Yantai&#x27;s administration, Penglai became a district in 2020.

==Geography==
Penglai District is entirely surrounded by other divisions of Yantai: Fushan District is to the east, Longkou City to the west, and Qixia City to the south. Its limits in geographic coordinates are 37° 25&#x27;–37° 50&#x27; N, 120° 35&#x27;–121° 09&#x27; E.

==History==
The Red Cliffs () of the area are reputed to have been the site where the Eight Immortals set out for the land of the immortals and where Emperor Qin later allegedly sent off a thousand men and girls on ships to search for them. One legend claims that a mystic dolphin was seen from the cliffs above and, missing it with his spear, the emperor knew that his days were numbered. The Emperor Wu of Han (&quot;Hàn Wǔdì&quot;) later also visited the area while searching for the elixir of immortality.

The old city walls incorporate guard towers of three stories (rather than the usual two) because the uncle of the first emperor of the 6th-century Sui dynasty had been prince of the area. Under the Ming dynasty, the harbor was fortified and used by the war ships of the Imperial Chinese Navy.

Yantai city became one of the first ports open to all foreigners on the Shandong Peninsula through Penglai in 1858. Christian missions were quickly established. The harbor was found inadequate for the traders, however, and Zhifu (now central Yantai) was developed away to function as Yantai city&#x27;s port.

In 2020, Changdao County, consisting of the Changdao Islands in the Bohai Strait, was merged into Penglai.

== Administrative divisions ==
As of July 2020, Penglai District has 6 streets, 8 towns and 6 townships: Dengzhou Sub-district, Zijingshan Sub-district, Xingang Sub-district, Penglaiguo Sub-district, Nanwang Sub-district, Nanchangshan Sub-district, Liujiagou Town, Chaoshui Town, Daliuxing Town, Xiaomenjia Town, Daxindian Town, Muriji Town, Beigou Town, Emery Town, North Changshan Township, Daqindao Township, Heihe Township, Xiaoqindao Township, Nanhuangcheng Township, Beihuangcheng Township, the district people&#x27;s government is located in Penglai Economic Development Zone, No. 169 Jinchuang Road.

=== Tourism ===

Penglai has been ranked by the Chinese government as a top domestic tourist destination. Its Water Fortress (, &quot;Shuǐchéng&quot;), a fortified harbor, is one of China&#x27;s oldest military ports. It was built under the Ming in 1376 and housed a fleet of warjunks. It is now a protected historical monument being renovated at a cost of 500m RMB (more than $60m). There is a plank walk along the cliffs nearby.

More than US$25 million has also been invested into developing the Penglai Pavilion and other sites. The Penglai Pavilion is a large park of ancient buildings, palaces and temples, that have been restored and rebuilt. It has been a tourist goal for more than a thousand years, and the site features inscriptions from famous poets and calligraphers like Su Shi and Dong Qichang. Among other cultural attractions of Penglai are the Naval Museum with exhibits of ancient ships and the restored residence of the famous patriotic general Qi Jiguang. Penglai also has the largest ocean aquarium in Asia. It includes a polar area, a shark hall, a tropical rainforest, and a theater with mermaids, dolphins and sea lions. A picturesque festival takes place in January for the birthday of Tianhou, a local sea goddess.

While tourism is the mainstay of Penglai&#x27;s economy, bringing more than two million tourists annually, in fact the entire center of the town around the harbour was walled off and completely razed in 2006.

=== Wine industry ===
The production of wine is the second largest industry in the province. Agriculture is first. However, in Penglai, tourism is the primary industry, and wine-making is second. The hills south of Penglai have an average elevation of , while the coastal areas are relatively flat. Most of the soil is loose, well-aerated, and rich in minerals and organic matters that enable full development of the root systems. The wineries are located mainly in the Nanwang Grape Valley and along the Yan-Peng Sightseeing Highway. The main varieties grown there, like Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Gernischt, Merlot, Riesling and Chardonnay, are all reaching 20 years of age, considered to be the golden stage for these grapes. Most of them maintain an average sugar content of above 20%. The Cabernet is especially typical, with good color and a dense fragrance.

<text>Kean University () is a public university in Union, Elizabeth, and Hillside, New Jersey. It is part of New Jersey&#x27;s public system of higher education and is a state-designated research university.

The university was founded in 1855 in Newark, New Jersey, as the Newark Normal School, then became New Jersey State Teachers College in 1937. In 1958, the college was relocated from Newark to Union Township, site of the Kean family&#x27;s ancestral home at Liberty Hall. After its move to the historic Livingston-Kean Estate, which includes the entire Liberty Hall acreage, the historic James Townley House, and Kean Hall, which historically housed the library of United States Senator Hamilton Fish Kean and served as a political meeting place, the school became Newark State College, a comprehensive institution providing a full range of academic programs and majors. Renamed Kean College of New Jersey in 1973, the institution earned university status on September 26, 1997, becoming Kean University of New Jersey. 

Kean University is the fourth-largest institution of higher education in New Jersey and is currently comprised of five colleges and the Nathan Weiss Graduate College. Kean University also hosts numerous research institutions, perhaps most prominently the New Jersey Center for Science, Technology and Mathematics, the Kean University Human Rights Institute, the Holocaust Resource Center, the Wynona Moore Lipman Ethnic Studies Center, and Liberty Hall. It has a satellite campus in Toms River, New Jersey, a campus in the Skylands Region of New Jersey and an international campus in Wenzhou, China.

==History==
===Livingston-Kean Estate===

====Livingston, Hamilton, and the American Revolution====
The building of the estate on which Kean University is situated was begun in 1760, when lawyer William Livingston, who would become New Jersey&#x27;s first elected governor on August 31, 1776, and a Revolutionary War patriot and signer of the United States Constitution, bought in then-Connecticut Farms and Elizabethtown, across the Hudson River from his New York City home, in hopes of establishing a country residence. By 1772, extensive grounds, gardens, and orchards had been developed and a 14-room Georgian-style house had been built under the supervision of Livingston. In its first year of occupancy the new house, christened Liberty Hall, was the residence of both Livingston and Alexander Hamilton. In 1773, Livingston moved to the home with his wife, Susannah French of New Brunswick, and their children, full-time.

Liberty Hall experienced damage from the Revolutionary War by both British and American forces, and the property featured prominently in the Revolutionary War&#x27;s Battle of Connecticut Farms. The property was restored and Livingston continued to maintain the gardens and grounds as governor until his 1790 death. The estate passed to Livingston&#x27;s son, future Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court Henry Brockholst Livingston. In 1798, the house was sold to George Richard Belasise, also known as Lord Bolingbroke, and his wife Isabella. The new owners established an English boxwood maze that still stands today and made extensive additions to the principal outbuildings of the property, established or improved a large hot house, and developed the gardens, introducing rare shrubs and trees to the grounds, and possibly laying out the grounds west of the mansion.

In 1811, the Kean family acquired the Livingston estate when Peter Kean purchased Liberty Hall in trust for his mother Susan Livingston Kean Niemcewicz (women not being eligible to own property in their own right at the time). Susan Livingston Kean, a niece of Governor Livingston, was the widow of John Kean, a Continental Congress delegate and advocate for the ratification of the Constitution in South Carolina who served as the first cashier of the Bank of the United States. Having died from a respiratory disease that developed as a result of being held prisoner of war at sea during the Revolution, Kean died at 39 and Susan Livingston Kean remarried to Count Julian Niemcewicz, a Polish nobleman who fled Poland after fighting unsuccessfully for Polish independence from Russia but returned in the wake of Napoleon&#x27;s successful campaigns. To honor her second husband Susan Kean changed the name of &quot;Liberty Hall&quot; to &quot;Ursino&quot;, the name of Niemcewicz&#x27;s Polish estate. 

Peter Kean, the only son of Susan and John Kean, who married Sarah Sabina Morris, a granddaughter of Lewis Morris, the first royal governor of New Jersey, and served as colonel of the Fourth Regiment of New Jersey and an escort of Lafayette on his tour of New Jersey predeceased his mother. His son, John Kean II, inherited Liberty Hall. John Kean II, who served on the staff of Governor Pennington with the rank of colonel, was an original stockholder of the Camden and Amboy Railroad, served as the first president of the Elizabeth and Somerville Railroad, as a vice president of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, as president of the National Bank of New Jersey, as president of the Elizabethtown Gaslight Company (later known as Elizabethtown Gas Company) and Elizabethtown Water Company lived at Liberty Hall for 60 years and made the most dramatically significant changes to the house and property in its history, transforming the house into a 50-room Victorian Italianate structure.

Another John Kean, son of John Kean II and Lucinetta Halsted Kean (&quot;Lucy Kean&quot;), inherited the estate after their deaths. John Kean served in the United States House of Representatives from 1883 to 1885, and again from 1887 to 1889, and in the United States Senate from 1899 to 1911. Senator Kean lived at Liberty Hall when not in Washington, D.C., and held annual New Year&#x27;s receptions for his political supporters at the estate. After the death of Senator John Kean the house passed to his nephew, Captain John Kean, a National Guard cavalryman and president of the National State Bank, the Elizabethtown Water Company, and the Elizabethtown Consolidated Gas Company. Captain John Kean was the son of Katharine Winthrop Kean and United States Senator Hamilton Fish Kean whose library was housed at Kean Hall, a building constructed for that specific purpose in 1912. A frequent political meeting place in the first years of its life, Kean Hall now houses the undergraduate admissions office and administrative offices including the Presidential Suite and the conference room for the Kean University Board of Trustees. Captain John Kean&#x27;s wife, Mary Alice Barney Kean, an historian and preservationist, was the last resident of Liberty Hall and was responsible for much of its preservation.

====Historic non-residents associated with Liberty Hall====
Liberty Hall has had many distinguished visitors, including Martha Washington, who stayed at Liberty Hall during her husband&#x27;s inauguration and President George Washington who visited his wife there not long after his swearing-in in New York City. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Jay was married to Governor Livingston&#x27;s daughter, Sarah, at Liberty Hall. Other guests included Lewis Morris, Lafayette, Elias Boudinot, and several presidents after Washington, including Ulysses S. Grant, William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton.

===Newark Normal School===

Kean University was founded in April 1855 in Newark, New Jersey as the Newark Normal School, a Saturday morning school initially established for the exclusive purpose of being a teacher-education college for the educators of the city of Newark. The university was founded by Stephen Congar, Newark&#x27;s Superintendent of Schools, who founded the Newark Normal School with the goal of ensuring the continued improvement of the city&#x27;s schools through quality teaching. The academy was designed to improve the skills of teachers whom Congar correctly viewed as lacking in formal training. Newark Normal School was the first Normal School created in New Jersey, and one of the earliest in the nation, with an inaugural class of 85 students, mostly women and primarily Newark High School alumni.

Most of the college&#x27;s first students were white, middle class, Protestants. Classes continued during the Civil War, but the numbers of men enrolled declined as young men joined the Union Army. Following the Union victory in the war, increasing numbers of Catholics, largely the children of immigrants, began to enroll beginning the school&#x27;s theme of a diverse student body that would continue to evolve over the next 150 years; by 1911 the children of immigrants exceeded thirty percent of the student body; since that time, Kean University has become one of the nation&#x27;s most diverse schools. In 1863 the Normal School students became formally required to teach in Newark Public Schools after graduation. In 1879 the Normal School program was extended to one year, and in 1888 to two years. The first classes of the Normal School met at Newark High School, then located on Washington and Linden Streets in Newark. In 1878, the Normal School moved to the Market Street School for about two decades before moving back to Newark High School in 1899. In 1898 the curriculum of the college was radically revised in an effort to have teachers &quot;professionalized&quot; and enhance the status of the institution.

===New Jersey State Normal School===
In 1913 the state took control of the college and the School was renamed the New Jersey State Normal School at Newark. The school moved to a new building at Fourth Street and Belleville Avenue (later Broadway Avenue) that year. In 1917, during World War I, the Normal School faculty and students worked in war-related fundraising and relief efforts.

In the following decade the normal school raised its standards further, as evidenced by a 1925 announcement that &quot;students who are deficient in spelling...will be dropped from the school&quot; and by the 1928 extension of the normal school program to three years. The Great Depression brought challenges for the school as enrollment and the overall number of teachers hired in New Jersey declined sharply. In 1934 a great milestone was reached when the normal school became a four-year college and the State Board of Education authorized it School to grant a bachelor&#x27;s degrees, a Bachelor of Science in education.

===New Jersey State Teachers College===
In 1937 the college was renamed the New Jersey State Teachers College at Newark and remained in the Broadway building until 1958, when it moved to the current Union Township, New Jersey campus.

====Impact of World War II====
World War II brought sweeping changes to the college with some 300 students serving in the armed forces and seven Newark State students losing their lives on active duty. During the war, President Roy L. Shaffer pledged to keep the college &quot;rolling&quot; as part of the &quot;moral and intellectual defense&quot; of the nation.

The accelerating changes during World War II altered the nature of the college as its students, faculty, and curriculum became more diverse, the campus underwent physical changes, and the student body changed dramatically. One young veteran, writing home from occupied Germany, predicted that the college would see a lot more men&#x27;s faces after the war, which turned out to be very accurate; the education benefits offered under the GI Bill of Rights drove men to apply at unprecedented levels, including more African-American students.

As the post-war Baby Boom generated a large demand for new teachers, the college found itself broadening in the face of student desires for a broader curriculum that quickly expanded to encompass the liberal arts and sciences, the professions, and graduate education. While the college maintained a focus on educating teachers it was quickly developing itself into a comprehensive institution. By the early 1950s, post-war growth had severely strained the college&#x27;s facilities, causing a need for a new campus.

===Newark State College===
The purchase of the Kean Estate in Union Township, then called the &quot;Green Lane Farm&quot;, allowed for a new campus in 1958 at the site of the Kean family&#x27;s ancestral home at Liberty Hall. The following year, in 1959, the institution changed its name to Newark State College, completing its transformation from a college of education to a comprehensive institute of higher education.

President Eugene Wilkins retired in 1969, following the successful transition of the college from Newark to Union, and the successful inaugural years of Newark State College. Wilkins was succeeded by Nathan Weiss, for whom the Nathan Weiss Graduate College is named. Weiss was committed to wide access to higher education, especially for first-generation college students, while fostering vastly expanded new programs in the sciences, health cares, business, and academic and administrative computing. Weiss led the school to its status as a multi-purpose institution.

===Kean College of New Jersey===
In 1973, Newark State College was renamed Kean College of New Jersey for the Kean family, whose members include Congressman Robert Winthrop Kean, U.S. Congressman and U.S. Senator John Kean of New Jersey, former New Jersey Governor and 9/11 Commission chairman Thomas Kean, U.S. Senator Hamilton Fish Kean, Julia Kean, the wife of U.S. Secretary of State and New York Governor Hamilton Fish, First Lady of the United States Anna Symmes Harrison, New Jersey State Senator and United States Senate nominee Thomas Kean Jr., and John Kean of South Carolina, a delegate to the Continental Congress.

Elsa Gomez became the first female president of Kean College in 1989 and served until 1994. By the 1990s the student body of Kean College was among the most diverse in New Jersey. The academic quality of the institution improved towards the end of the 20th century as more members of the faculty, in rapidly escalating numbers, pursued teaching innovations, original scholarship and research, and external grants and funding. By the time Kean College of New Jersey became a university in 1997, under President Ronald L. Applbaum, the institution had achieved a higher level of academic and public recognition.

===Kean University===
Becoming Kean University of New Jersey on September 26, 1997, Kean soon added the Nathan Weiss Graduate College. In 2003, Dawood Farahi was elected president of Kean University by the unanimous vote of the board of trustees.

Kean University has grown to become the third largest institution of higher education in the State of New Jersey, after Rutgers University and Montclair State University. In recent years, besides its campuses in Union and Hillside, New Jersey, the university has recently completed additional expansions to Toms River, New Jersey, which houses an Ocean County satellite campus, as well as the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 2006, the university announced that it was seeking approval from the Chinese and U.S. educational governing bodies to be the first American university to open an extensive University campus on Chinese soil. The new campus is located in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, one of the richest, fastest growing Chinese provinces. The Chinese campus has a growing student body.

In 2009, the administration unveiled a major reorganization plan touted as the &quot;first step&quot; in privatizing the university. Faculty reacted negatively to the plan, including a 2010 vote of &quot;no confidence.&quot; One year later, the university&#x27;s president, Dawood Farahi came under scrutiny from the Kean Federation of Teachers leadership who accused him of multiple errors on his resumes. 

After hiring an independent law firm to review Farahi&#x27;s resume, the Board of Trustees of Kean University voted 7-4 with one abstention to retain him as president of the university. The following year, in April 2012, the NCAA accused the university of &quot;major violations&quot; and placed all of its sports teams on probation. This turmoil attracted the attention of the university&#x27;s regional accreditor who initially demanded answers from the university in 2011 and briefly placed the university on probation in 2012.

On May 11, 2020, Lamont Repollet, Ed.D., was selected as the 18th president of Kean University by the Kean University Board of Trustees.

Wenzhou-Kean University (WKU) is China&#x27;s first and only full-scale American-style university, but the plans became caught up in red tape in the Beijing government. In 2012, the issues were resolved and Kean officials traveled to China to break ground on this joint venture. In 2016, the first students from Wenzhou-Kean University graduated.

The campus sits on 500 acres and has won several rewards for its integration of American and Chinese layout and architecture. Classes are in English and over 120 degree programs are offered.

<doc id="295205" wikidata="Q1148444" url="?curid=295205" title="Blunderbuss">
<text>The blunderbuss is a 17th- to mid-19th-century firearm with a short, large caliber barrel. It is commonly flared at the muzzle to help aid in the loading of shot and other projectiles of relevant quantity or caliber. The blunderbuss is commonly considered to be an early predecessor of the modern shotgun, with similar military usage. It was effective only at short range, lacking accuracy at long distances. A blunderbuss in handgun form was called a &quot;dragon&quot;, and it is from this that the term &quot;dragoon&quot; evolved.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;blunderbuss&quot; is of Dutch origin, from the Dutch word &quot;donderbus&quot;, which is a combination of &quot;donder&quot;, meaning &quot;thunder&quot;, and &quot;bus&quot;, meaning &quot;container, tin&quot; (Middle Dutch: &quot;busse&quot;, box, jar, from Latin &quot;buxus&quot;, box tree).

The transition from &quot;donder&quot; to &quot;blunder&quot; is thought by some to be deliberate; the term &quot;blunder&quot; was originally used in a transitive sense, synonymous with &quot;to confuse&quot;, and this is thought to describe the stunningly loud report of the large-bore, short-barreled blunderbuss. The term &quot;dragon&quot; is taken from the fact that early versions were decorated with a carving in the form of a mythic dragon&#x27;s head around the muzzle; the muzzle blast would then give the impression of a fire-breathing dragon.

==Design and use==

The flared muzzle is the defining feature of the blunderbuss, differentiating it from large caliber carbines; the distinction between the blunderbuss and the musketoon is less distinct, as musketoons were also used to fire shot, and some had flared barrels. The muzzle (and often the bore) was flared with the intent not only to increase the spread of the shot, but also to funnel powder and shot into the weapon, making it easier to reload on horseback or on a moving carriage; modern experiments corroborated the dramatic improvement in shot spread, going from a diameter from a straight barrel to an average of spread at . 

Blunderbusses were typically short, with barrels under in length, at a time when a typical musket barrel was over long. One source, describing arms from the early to middle 17th century, lists the barrel length of a wheel lock dragon at around , compared to a length for a blunderbuss.

The blunderbuss could be considered an early type of shotgun and served in many similar roles. Though some old accounts may list the blunderbuss as being loaded with various scrap iron, rocks, or wood, which might well result in damage to the bore of the gun, it was typically loaded with a number of lead balls smaller than the bore diameter. Barrels were made of steel or brass.



The blunderbuss, and especially the dragon, was typically issued to troops such as cavalry, who needed a lightweight, easily handled firearm. The dragon became so associated with cavalry and mounted infantry that the term &quot;dragoon&quot; became synonymous with mounted infantry. In addition to the cavalry, the blunderbuss found a use for other duties in which the shotgun-like qualities were desirable, such as for guarding prisoners or defending a mail coach, and its use for urban combat was also recognized. Blunderbusses were also commonly carried by officers on naval warships, by privateers and by pirates for use in close-quarters boarding actions. The Portuguese Marines used it widely in the 17th century. Many types of ammunition, including gravel and sand, could be shot in a pinch, but most of the time they were shot using traditional lead balls.

The blunderbuss used by the British Royal Mail during the period of 1788–1816 was a flintlock with a long flared brass barrel, brass trigger guard, and an iron trigger and lock. A typical British mail coach would have a single postal employee on board, armed with a blunderbuss and a pair of pistols to guard the mail from highwaymen. One 18th century &quot;coaching blunderbuss&quot; in another British collection had a brass barrel long, flaring to at the muzzle; it was also provided with a spring-loaded bayonet, which was held along the barrel by a catch and would spring forward into place when released. Spring-loaded bayonet blunderbusses were also used by the Nottingham City Police after its formation around 1840.

While the blunderbuss is often associated with the Plymouth Colony Pilgrims of 1620, evidence suggests that the blunderbuss was relatively scarce in the American colonies. After the Battle of Lexington in 1775, British General Thomas Gage occupied Boston, Massachusetts, and upon negotiating with the town committee, Gage agreed to let the inhabitants of Boston leave town with their families and effects if they surrendered all arms. While most of the residents of Boston stayed, those who left under the agreement surrendered 1,778 long arms, 634 pistols, 273 bayonets, and only 38 blunderbusses. The blunderbuss did still have its civilian applications, however; the Lewis and Clark Expedition carried a number of blunderbusses, some of which were mounted and used as small swivel guns on the pirogues.

Crude tripwire activated blunderbusses, known as alarm guns, spring guns and cemetery guns, were set up in graveyards and country estates to scare away poachers and resurrection men, and to alert the gamekeeper or sexton to their presence.

By the middle of the 19th century, the blunderbuss was replaced for military use by the carbine, but still found use by civilians as a defensive firearm.

== History ==

Early 17th century: The blunderbuss emerges in Europe, likely originating from the Netherlands. Its name derives from the Dutch &quot;donderbus&quot;, meaning &quot;thunder gun&quot;.

Mid 17th century: The blunderbuss becomes more widely used in Europe, particularly in England. It is adopted by both military forces and civilians for its effectiveness in close-quarters combat and self-defense.

Late 17th century: The blunderbuss is increasingly used by naval forces, including the British Royal Navy, for boarding actions and ship defense.

Early 18th century: The blunderbuss reaches peak popularity. Its intimidating appearance and powerful shot make it a preferred weapon for stagecoach drivers, travelers, and home defense.

Early 19th century: The decline of the blunderbuss begins. Advances in firearm technology, such as the development of rifled barrels and more accurate long guns, reduce its prevalence.

<doc id="295206" wikidata="Q57653" url="?curid=295206" title="Princess Sophie of Bavaria">
<text>Princess Sophie of Bavaria (Sophie Friederike Dorothea Wilhelmine; 27 January 1805 – 28 May 1872) was the daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his second wife, Caroline of Baden. The identical twin sister of Queen Maria Anna of Saxony, Sophie became Archduchess of Austria by marriage to Archduke Franz Karl of Austria. Her eldest son, Franz Joseph, reigned as Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary; her second son, Maximilian, briefly reigned as Emperor of Mexico.

==Childhood (1805–1824)==
The fourth child of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Caroline of Baden, Princess Sophie Friederike Dorothea Wilhelmine was born on 27 January 1805 in Nymphenburg Palace, Munich. She was said to be her father’s favorite daughter although she was more attached to her mother, whom she loved dearly. Sophie adored her twin sister Maria Anna and was very close to all her sisters.

==Archduchess of Austria (1824–1872)==
On 4 November 1824, she married Archduke Franz Karl of Austria. Her paternal half-sister, Caroline Augusta of Bavaria, had married the groom&#x27;s widowed father, Francis II, in 1816. Sophie and Franz Karl had six children. Emperor Francis II was truly fond of Sophie. Although Sophie had little in common with her husband, she was a caring and devoted wife to Franz Karl who loved and respected her.

Unlike her husband, Sophie was attached to all of her children, especially Franz Joseph, as well as Ferdinand Maximilian, who was her favorite son. She had a reputation for being strong-willed and authoritarian by nature but she was also known as a familiar and sociable person devoted to her family and the Habsburg empire she married into. She enjoyed court life, dance, art and literature as well as horse riding.

Her ambition to place her oldest son on the Austrian throne was a constant theme in Austrian politics. At the time she was called &quot;the only man at court&quot;. During the Revolution of 1848, she persuaded her somewhat feeble-minded husband to give up his rights to the throne in favour of their son Franz Joseph.
After Franz Joseph&#x27;s accession, Sophie became the power behind the throne. Historically, Sophie is remembered for her extremely adversarial relationship with Franz Joseph&#x27;s wife Elisabeth &quot;Sisi&quot;, who was also her niece. Elisabeth hated Sophie for being demanding and the upbringing of Elisabeth&#x27;s children, but there is no evidence that the Archduchess had the same feelings, as Elisabeth is usually described quite pleasantly in Sophie&#x27;s diary and letters. Nonetheless, she had better relationships with her other daughters-in-law and was a caring mother-in-law to Archduchess Maria Annunziata.

Sophie kept a detailed diary most of her life, which reveals much about Austrian court life. She was deeply affected in 1867 by the execution in Mexico of her second son Maximilian. She never recovered from that shock, and withdrew from public life. She died from pneumonia in 1872.

===Alleged extramarital affair===
She was also noted for her close relationship with Napoleon II, who lived at the Austrian Court as the Duke of Reichstadt. There were rumors of a sexual affair between them. There was even suspicion that Maximilian, born two weeks before Reichstadt&#x27;s death in 1832, was actually his child. These claims were never verified, but it is certain that they were very good friends and that his death affected her very much. She is said to have turned into the hard, ambitious woman described in fiction after he died.

==Children==
==Portrayal on stage and screen==

* In the &quot;Sissi&quot; films (1955–1957), Vilma Degischer played the part of Sophie as a chillingly strict mother-in-law of the young Empress. The stereotype of Sophie as an uptight and spiteful villain seems to have spread from these films.
* In the 1974 miniseries, &quot;Fall of Eagles&quot;, Sophie was portrayed by English actress Pamela Brown.
* &quot;Mayerling&quot;, a 1978 ballet by Kenneth MacMillan, features Sophie in a slightly more sympathetic light.
* &quot;Elisabeth&quot;, a 1992 musical by Michael Kunze about the life of Empress Elisabeth, where Sophie is portrayed as a malevolent intriguer, out to ruin her daughter-in-law&#x27;s life by any possible means, though more recent productions have somewhat softened her character with additional scenes and a song that give more insight into Sophie&#x27;s complex motivations and personality.
*In &quot;Sissi, l&#x27;impératrice rebelle&quot;, a 2004 French television film, Sophie was played by Stéphane Audran.
*In the 2009 European mini-series &quot;Sisi&quot;, Martina Gedeck portrayed Sophie in one of the more balanced interpretations of the character.
*The 2022 Netflix series &quot;The Empress&quot; features a Sophie played by Melika Foroutan.

<text>Monmouth University is a private university in West Long Branch, New Jersey, United States. Founded in 1933 as Monmouth Junior College, it became Monmouth College in 1956 and Monmouth University in 1995 after receiving its charter. It enrolls about 4,660 undergraduate and 1,750 graduate students and employs 302 full-time faculty members.

==History==

===Early years===
The school that would become Monmouth University was founded in 1933 as Monmouth Junior College, a two-year junior college under Dean Edward G. Schlaefer. Created in New Jersey during the Great Depression, Monmouth Junior College was intended by Schlaefer to provide an opportunity for higher education to high school graduates in Monmouth County who could not afford to go away to college. The junior college did not have its own campus at the time of its founding and was housed at Long Branch High School in Long Branch. Due to sharing a building with a high school, classes were taught during evening hours after the high school students had departed.

Monmouth Junior College opened to students on November 21, 1933. The junior college&#x27;s first student enrollment was reported at 325, all graduates from Monmouth County high schools, with a faculty of 12 instructors. Federal reemployment funds financed the junior college, with approximately $18,000 approved by New Jersey Director of Emergency Relief John Colt.

In 1947, the school received full college accreditation from the New Jersey Board of Education to award associate degrees to students. 100 students became the first recipients of associate degrees from Monmouth Junior College the following year. Support from students and the community is credited with helping the school continue to teach classes and become a privately funded institution.

===New location and four-year status===
Monmouth Junior College acquired its own campus in 1955 when it relocated from Long Branch to the estate of Shadow Lawn in West Long Branch. The estate was purchased from Eugene H. Lehman for $350,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). In addition to the monetary cost, Lehman signed over the estate under the condition he would serve as the school&#x27;s president for one year.

A year later, the school was renamed Monmouth College when it was accredited by the state to offer four-year programs that would award bachelor degrees to students. Through the agreement that granted Shadow Lawn to the school, Lehman became the first president of Monmouth College from 1956 to 1957. Schlaefer resumed leadership after Lehman&#x27;s tenure, serving as president from 1957 to 1962. Monmouth&#x27;s first commencement was held at Shadow Lawn the same year that Schlaefer assumed the presidency and the first bachelor&#x27;s degrees were awarded the year after, in 1958.

The 1960s saw further growth for Monmouth in campus size, athletics, student life, and academics. At the start of the decade, the Murry and Leonie Foundation transferred ownership of the Murry Guggenheim House to Monmouth, which became the school&#x27;s library. The transfer also included a stable and carriage house that would be converted into the Lauren K. Woods Theatre. Elmwood and Pinewood, Monmouth&#x27;s first campus residence halls, opened in 1963, while the William T. Boylan Gymnasium was built in 1965 as a new home for the basketball team. Additional property was acquired by the college in 1969 when Monmouth was granted ownership of Maurice Pollak&#x27;s home, the site of what would become Pollak Theatre. Amid the campus expansion, Monmouth College received authorization from the state to offer graduate programs and award master degrees in 1967.

Monmouth&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1983 was coincided by its athletics program being granted Division I status from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Teams representing Monmouth competed in the Northeast Conference for the next three decades. The 50th anniversary also saw the first Founders&#x27; Day at Monmouth, which would become an annual tradition. Four years later, the school&#x27;s Athletics Hall of Fame was established. The school&#x27;s athletic program was joined by a football team in 1993.

===University charter===

A significant development occurred for Monmouth in 1995 when it was granted university status by the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education, resulting in the school being renamed Monmouth University. The university status was obtained under the leadership of Rebecca Stafford, the school&#x27;s first female president, who described Monmouth as being &quot;on the move&quot;. The College Center, constructed in the 1970s, would be renamed the Rebecca Stafford Student Center in her honor.

The 21st century saw the completion of a pedestrian underpass on campus in 2001. By the end of the decade, the Multipurpose Activity Center replaced the William T. Boylan Gymnasium as the home of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams in 2009. The new facility, which cost $57 million, was described by then-Senior Associate Athletic Director Jeff Stapleton as &quot;probably the biggest undertaking that the institution has done&quot;. The facility was renamed OceanFirst Bank Center in 2016 after Monmouth University and OceanFirst Bank reached a $4 million agreement through 2036 that included the naming rights of the facility.

The athletic teams would continue to compete in the Northeast Conference until 2013 when they moved to the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC). As the MAAC did not sponsor collegiate football, Monmouth&#x27;s football team became part of the Big South Conference as an associate member. In 2022, all teams except for women&#x27;s bowling joined the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA).

==Campus==

===Great Hall at Shadow Lawn===

The centerpiece of the Monmouth University campus is Shadow Lawn. Originally, it was the site of the Shadow Lawn mansion, constructed in 1903 and housed 52 rooms.

After the original Shadow Lawn was destroyed by a fire in 1927, the current building that would become was built as a residence for Mr. and Mrs. Hubert Templeton Parson. Mr. Parson was the former head of F. W. Woolworth Company. The building was designed by Horace Trumbauer and Julian Abele. Abele is regarded as the first professional African American architect.

Shadow Lawn became municipal property during the Great Depression and until Monmouth acquired ownership, it was home to Highland Manor Junior College, a private girls&#x27; school. Some classrooms and the administrative offices are inside of the building. Shadow Lawn was named to the National Register of Historic Places on March 28, 1978. It was named a National Historic Landmark on February 4, 1985.

Shadow Lawn has also been a host of the film version of &quot;Annie&quot;, starring Aileen Quinn. Some of the scenes in this movie were filmed inside and outside of the building along with the rest of the Monmouth University campus. Shadow Lawn was used as Daddy Warbucks&#x27; mansion.

Following Monmouth&#x27;s acquisition of the estate, Shadow Lawn was renamed Woodrow Wilson Hall after United States President Woodrow Wilson, who stayed in the original mansion during his campaign in summer of 1916. The current mansion was renamed to Great Hall in 2020, with the university citing racist policies of Wilson for the change.

===Murry and Leonie Guggenheim Memorial Library===

In 1903, Murry Guggenheim (1858–1939), son of Meyer Guggenheim, bought property in West Long Branch to build a summer residence for himself and his wife, Leonie. The original structure of the Beaux-Arts mansion, designed by Carrère and Hastings is now the Murry and Leonie Guggenheim wing of the Monmouth University Library. It was also added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 28, 1978.

===Lauren K. Woods Theater===

The Guggenheim estate also included a stable and carriage house across the road on Cedar Avenue. This has been converted into the Lauren K. Woods Theatre.

===Rankings===

Monmouth University&#x27;s placement on the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges Ranking&quot; increased during the 2010s, moving from 76 in 2005 to 37 in 2012 and 30 in 2013 among regional universities in the Northern United States. By 2018, Monmouth ranked at 28 among northern regional universities, its highest spot at the time from &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The ranking also made Monmouth the highest private regional university in New Jersey and the state&#x27;s second-highest regional university behind The College of New Jersey.

Despite moving up in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranking, however, Monmouth University did not appear on &quot;Forbes&quot;″s List of America&#x27;s Best Colleges until 2021. Mark Blackmon, the director of News and Public Affairs at Monmouth, attributed the school&#x27;s omission in 2016 to &quot;Forbes&quot; relying &quot;on some information that can be highly subjective&quot;, with schools &quot;[losing] points for awarding grants and scholarships&quot;. In response to Forbes allegedly lowering a school&#x27;s ranking for providing financial support, Blackmon commented that, &quot;We are actually quite proud that we can assist so many students in getting an education&quot;, and concluded, &quot;Even though Monmouth failed to make the Forbes list, I think that it doesn&#x27;t reflect the quality of its teachers and the type of school that Monmouth is. I think it should have definitely made it.&quot; The 2021 ranking marked the first appearance of Monmouth University, in which it placed 394. It remained on Forbes&#x27; rankings until dropping off in 2024.

Monmouth University has held multiple academic symposia on the work of Bruce Springsteen and houses the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music.

==Student life==

===Activities===
Monmouth University has a variety of on-campus clubs and organizations, including the campus television station &quot;HawkTV&quot;; the college radio station WMCX-FM, one of the last media outlets to interview Bob Marley and the first media outlet in America to announce his death; and the student-run newspaper &quot;The Outlook&quot;, which has been published since 1933.

The Department of Art and Design is an active participant in the arts of Monmouth. It maintains multiple galleries for exhibiting creative works of students, faculty, and staff, as well as practicing artists and designers.

Monmouth University also has its own independent, student run record label, Blue Hawk Records. The music organization allows students to learn hands-on, gaining relevant experience and encountering situations that would occur in the Music Industry. Blue Hawk Records allows students to work together, alongside experienced industry professionals, to build their skills in talent scouting, artist promotion and development, live music and record releases, artwork, packaging, sales, marketing, further learning the structure of business and how to mold artists into marketable material.

Monmouth University joined the Colonial Athletic Association on July 1, 2022.

==Athletics==

Monmouth&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Hawks. The Hawks compete as members of the Coastal Athletic Association. The school had competed as a Division I (NCAA) school in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference from 2013 to 2022, with football competing as an FCS independent in the 2013 season before joining the Big South Conference in 2014. Monmouth left the MAAC and joined the CAA on July 1, 2022. Monmouth fields the following sports at the Division I level: baseball, basketball (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), bowling (women&#x27;s) cross country (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), field hockey, football, golf (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), indoor track (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), lacrosse (women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s), soccer (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), softball, tennis (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), and track &amp; field (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s). In the fall of 2014, Monmouth announced the reintroduction of swimming programs (women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s) at the Division I level in the fall of 2015.

Monmouth University (then still Monmouth College), added football to the school&#x27;s ledger of sports teams in 1993. The team&#x27;s first game was played on September 25 of that year. The first points in school history were scored on a bizarre defensive play by intercepting and returning a two-point conversion.

A new multipurpose activity center opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on September 16, 2009. The Center currently serves as the primary indoor athletic structure. A partnership agreement with OceanFirst Bank named the facility as the OceanFirst Bank Center in June 2016. It houses a 4,100 seat competition arena; a 200-meter; six-lane indoor track; locker rooms; educational and conference space; ground-level bookstore; and fitness center. The new facility adjoins the William T. Boylan Gymnasium a 2,500-seat arena built in 1965.

Monmouth has been in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 1996, 2001, 2004, and 2006. Monmouth won their first NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament game in 2006 when they beat Hampton University in that year&#x27;s play-in game. It was the first time a Northeast Conference school won a game in the NCAA tournament since 1983 when Robert Morris University won in the opening round. Monmouth&#x27;s men and women&#x27;s soccer teams as well as baseball, women&#x27;s lacrosse, men&#x27;s tennis and men&#x27;s golf team have also reached the NCAA tournament. The men&#x27;s lacrosse team made the 2016 NCAA playoff tournament as well. The Monmouth Men&#x27;s Soccer team is the only sport on campus to ever advance to the second round of the NCAA tournament. The men&#x27;s soccer team also hosted three first round NCAA Tournament games on The Great Lawn, in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Monmouth&#x27;s men&#x27;s soccer team has even been ranked as one of the top teams in the country. In September 2010, Monmouth attained the #4 spot on the NSCAA/HendrickCars.com National Rankings and has been ranked in the national top 25 every single week for the past two seasons. Men&#x27;s lacrosse won the 2021 MAAC conference championship

<text>The Eden Corn Festival is a small fair held in the agriculture-based town of Eden. Eden is located in Erie County, New York, and has some of the most fertile and well-drained soils in New York State, allowing farmers to grow over of corn annually, and produce more early corn than anyone else in upstate New York.

== History ==
In 1959, the Eden Chamber of Commerce discussed the idea of holding an annual festival to promote the town. The resulting Garden Festival was held that year, but did not become an annual event. In 1962, the town had a very successful 150th Sesquicentennial celebration. Following the celebration, a man named John Munich brought up the idea to the Chamber of Commerce of a yearly corn festival aimed to make the town money and gain publicity. After further talk and planning, the Chamber President proposed the sweet corn festival in May, 1963, and the Eden Corn Festival was born. The dates were set for Saturday, August 15 and Sunday, August 16, due to this being the time of year that Eden&#x27;s sweet corn would be most tender. Various committees were set up, and decisions had to be made regarding how big the festival should be, how much money would be required to finance it, and how the money could be raised, since the treasury balance at the time amounted to a mere few hundred dollars. The festival would be held on the grounds of the Newell Faulkner Post of the American Legion on Legion Drive and Route 62, and the committees received help from the American Legion and the Eden School District, who allowed the use of the parking lots on the school grounds and use of their athletic fields. The first corn festival was successful, featuring a carnival, corn judging and auction, a corn queen beauty contest, pet show, tug-of-war, and a parade. Corn was sold for 10 cents an ear, and had to be picked in the dark to keep up with the demand for the 6,000 ears sold. Swimming events, lacrosse and baseball games, square dancing, and a concert provided additional entertainment. It was decided that the Eden Corn Festival would become an annual event, and it has been held every year since 1964.

== Years following ==
Early on, the festival was a local event. The concessionaires were local, and Zabel Amusements from Derby provided the rides. In 1966, it was decided to enlarge the festival by having a bigger parade with more prizes. The attendance that year reached 2,500, and eventually, the parade drew marching units and groups from all over the United States and Canada. A man named Bill Edwards became the Chairman of the Eden Corn Festival in 1974, an since then, it has become a four-day event. On August 2, 1978, a Guinness Book World Record category for the most ears of corn eaten in five minutes was established, when Luis Pirada of Eden devoured 18 ears. Attendance this year reached 75,000, and by 1980, the project outgrew the Chamber&#x27;s capabilities and they turned sponsorship over to the newly formed Eden Corn Festival, Inc., which consisted of members from various organizations in the town. Over the years, the physical ground of the festival was expanded, and by 1988 the Eden Volunteer Fire Department, which to this day sponsors the corn and french fry booths, was selling 45,000 ears of corn. By 1993, the parade had become too big and expensive and was almost canceled. The budget was reduced to $2,000–$3,000, when the cost of the 29th parade a year before had been $96,000. It was decided to scale down from the New York/Pennsylvania Parade and Judging Association&#x27;s Championship that was filled with bands and floats from all over the Northeast to groups from Eden and Western New York. During this time, a craft show, car show, and talent show were added, along with more rides. The 30th annual corn festival of 1993 had 105,000 in attendance, and has averaged 200,000 people or more ever since. To this day, the Eden Corn Festival is held Thursday through Sunday during the first weekend in August, and inarguably remains the highlight of the year for the town&#x27;s small population.
