<text>Custer&#x27;s Revenge (also known as Mystique Presents Swedish Erotica: Custer&#x27;s Revenge) is an adult action game published by American Multiple Industries for the Atari 2600, first released in November 1982. The game gained notoriety owing to its goal of raping a Native American woman who is tied to a post.

The titular player character is based on Lieutenant Colonel and Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer, a famous American cavalry commander who is most well known for his major defeat and death at the Battle of Little Bighorn.

Following the Christmas season of 1982, the rights to American Multiple Industries&#x27; games, including &quot;Custer&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, were sold off to the adult video game company PlayAround. Under PlayAround&#x27;s parent company, Castlespring Enterprises, &quot;Custer&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was re-branded as &quot;Westward Ho&quot; for the European market and given slight modifications to its original gameplay. These alterations included simple aesthetic changes such as the darkening in color of the Native American woman&#x27;s skin tone. PlayAround also made a gender-reversed version of &quot;Custer&#x27;s Revenge&quot; named &quot;General Retreat&quot;.

The game was universally panned by critics due to its offensive content and has been described as one of the worst video games ever made.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Custer&#x27;s Revenge&quot; is an action video game in which the player controls a mostly nude General Custer, who must advance through the playing field and avoid arrows to rape the fully nude Native American woman Revenge, who is tied to a pole on the other side. The game consists of four numbered modes of play; modes 1 and 3 are single-player campaigns, while modes 2 and 4 are hotseat multiplayer modes. In modes 1 and 2, the player(s) must only avoid arrows, while in modes 3 and 4, cacti that appear and disappear at random intervals are added as obstacles. Custer can move left or right if the joystick is moved in those directions, while shifting the joystick up or down will cause Custer to stop.

Custer begins the game with three lives, which are represented by small cacti on a black stripe at the bottom of the screen. If an arrow touches Custer&#x27;s hat or if Custer comes into contact with a cactus, he loses a life to the tune of &quot;Taps&quot;. It is possible for Custer to stand in between two arrows and not get hit. If Custer successfully reaches Revenge, the player must repeatedly press the fire button for Custer to rape her, which occurs to the &quot;Charge&quot; fanfare. Each penetration awards one point, and the player earns an extra life for every 50 points. The player(s) can accumulate no more than six lives at any given time. For every 50 points scored, Custer returns to his original position on the field, and the speed of the arrows increases. The arrow speed can also be increased by flipping the difficulty switch on the Atari console.

== Development and release ==
&quot;Custer&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was developed as part of the &quot;Swedish Erotica&quot; series to capitalize on the lack of pornography available in the medium of video games. The development was deliberately sloppy and rushed because quality did not matter—they only needed a product on store shelves. The overtly racist and sexist themes were chosen to maximize outrage and generate free publicity.

&quot;Custer&#x27;s Revenge&quot; quickly gained notoriety upon its release. Sold in a sealed package labeled &quot;NOT FOR SALE TO MINORS&quot; and selling for $49.95 (), it acknowledged that children might nonetheless see the game. The game&#x27;s literature stated &quot;if the kids catch you and should ask, tell them Custer and the maiden are just dancing.&quot; The makers elected to preview the game for women&#x27;s and Native American groups, an act that many thought was a publicity stunt.

Women&#x27;s rights groups such as the National Organization for Women criticized the game as &quot;degrading, offensive and a blatant statement of racism and sexism [...] NOW cannot ignore any company which seeks to so blatantly portray acts of violence against women as a form of entertainment.&quot; Native Americans also protested the game, with the executive director of the Tulsa Native American Coalition saying &quot;It is very degrading to the Indian woman as well as all women in general,&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s no other way we can take it other than a racial slur.&quot; Other groups that opposed the game included the Native American Political Action Committee, United National Indian Youth Inc., the Oklahoma Human Rights Commission, the American Indian Training and Employment Program, the NAACP, the Urban League, and the YWCA. American Multiple Industries president Stuart Keston responded to criticism of the game by saying &quot;There is a sexual act, but it is not rape. It never has been.&quot;

Los Angeles County voted 3–1 to ban &quot;Custer&#x27;s Revenge&quot; alongside American Multiple Industries&#x27; other adult-only games &quot;Bachelor Party&quot; and &quot;Beat &#x27;Em &amp; Eat &#x27;Em&quot;. Suffolk County, New York voted to ban all &quot;X-rated&quot; games within their jurisdiction. Multiple Industries subsequently pursued an $11 million lawsuit against Suffolk County and legislator Philip Nolan &quot;because of a resolution authorizing the county executive to take action to halt sales and distribution&quot; of the game. Oklahoma City, home to a large Native American population, also unanimously passed a resolution condemning the game as &quot;distasteful&quot; and &quot;not in the best interests of the community&quot;. While both Ward 1 Councilman Bob McCoy and city attorney Walter Powell sought to block distribution within the city, and Multiple Industries did briefly halt distribution there, it was never officially banned by the city as is sometimes erroneously reported.

Nevertheless, the focused media attention generated publicity for the game and it sold approximately 80,000 copies, twice as many as &quot;Bachelor Party&quot; and &quot;Beat &#x27;Em &amp; Eat &#x27;Em&quot;. Atari received numerous complaints about the game however and responded by trying to sue the game&#x27;s makers. Stuart Kesten, President of American Multiple Industries, stated &quot;our object is not to arouse, our object is to entertain [...] When people play our games, we want them smiling, we want them laughing.&quot; The game&#x27;s designer, Joel Martin, said Custer was &quot;seducing&quot; the maiden and that she was a &quot;willing participant&quot;. By April 1983, the game was withdrawn from circulation.

==Reception==
In 1988, computer gaming magazine &quot;Ahoy!&quot; called &quot;Custer&#x27;s Revenge&quot; &quot;an [affront] to common decency&quot;, in contrast to more modern and &#x27;tasteful&#x27; adult games. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Seanbaby placed it as number 9 in his &quot;20 worst games of all time&quot; feature.

In 2008, the University of Calgary professor Tom Keenan cited &quot;the hideous &quot;Custer&#x27;s Revenge&quot; game&quot;, 26 years after its release, in an op-ed piece about current video game violence issues for the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;. That same year, the game was credited by Australian &quot;PC Magazine&quot; as being one of the worst games ever made, while Games.net ranked Custer&#x27;s victim as fifth on the list of top ten &quot;disturbingly sexual&quot; game characters. In 2010, Custer placed eighth on machinima.com&#x27;s list of the top perverts in gaming. UGO.com ranked it as tenth on the list of the most racist video games in history in 2010, also ranking the game&#x27;s General Custer as the second most unsexy video game character of all time in 2012.

<text>Charles John Biddle (April 30, 1819 – September 28, 1873) was an American soldier, lawyer, congressman, and newspaper editor.

==Biography==
Biddle was born and died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Nicholas Biddle, president of the Second Bank of the United States, and nephew of Congressman Richard Biddle. Charles Biddle graduated from Princeton in 1837, where he studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1840.

Biddle served in the Mexican–American War, serving as captain and company commander in the Regiment of Voltigeurs and Foot Riflemen. He was brevetted to the rank of major for gallantry in the Battle of Chapultepec. At the close of the war, he returned to Philadelphia to practice law.

In May 1861, following the outbreak of the American Civil War and President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s call to arms, he was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Pennsylvania Reserves, rising in May to the rank of colonel in command of the 42nd Pennsylvania Volunteers Infantry (13th Reserves), also known as the 1st Pennsylvania Rifles. In October of that year he was elected to the Thirty-seventh United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Edward J. Morris. He was tendered a commission as a brigadier general, but declined it, and then resigned from the army in February 1862.

After the war, he became one of the proprietors and editor-in-chief of the &quot;Philadelphia Age&quot;, and retained that position for the remainder of his life. His literary work was confined mainly to editorial contributions to the columns of this journal. His only separate publication was &quot;The Case of Major André&quot;, a carefully prepared essay read before the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, which vindicated the action of George Washington. The immediate occasion was a passage in Lord Mahon&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot; that denounced the execution of André as the greatest blot upon Washington&#x27;s record. By an authority so high as the &quot;London Critic&quot;, this essay was subsequently pronounced a fair refutation of Lord Mahon&#x27;s charge.

<doc id="294748" wikidata="Q983174" url="?curid=294748" title="Kenny MacAskill">
<text>Kenneth Wright MacAskill (born 28 April 1958) is a Scottish politician who was Member of Parliament (MP) for East Lothian from 2019 to 2024. He previously served as Cabinet Secretary for Justice from 2007 to 2014 and was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 1999 to 2016. A former member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he defected to the Alba Party in 2021 and currently serves as the party&#x27;s acting leader, following former leader Alex Salmond&#x27;s death in October 2024.

Born in Edinburgh and educated at Linlithgow Academy, MacAskill studied law at the University of Edinburgh and was a senior partner in a law firm in Glasgow. He was a long-standing member of the SNP&#x27;s National Executive Committee and served as treasurer and vice convener of policy, before being elected at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election. He was convener of the Scottish Parliament Subordinate Legislation Committee from 1999 to 2001.

Following the SNP&#x27;s victory in 2007, MacAskill was appointed as Cabinet Secretary for Justice in the Scottish Government. In this role, he oversaw the controversial transfer of convicted terrorist Abdelbaset al-Megrahi to his native Libya. MacAskill left office in November 2014 in the Cabinet reshuffle which followed the appointment of Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister of Scotland and stood down from the Scottish Parliament at the 2016 election.

After standing down from the Scottish Parliament, MacAskill was elected to the House of Commons as MP for East Lothian at the 2019 general election, gaining the previously Labour-held seat from Martin Whitfield. In March 2021, MacAskill defected from the SNP to the Alba Party. At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, he stood on the Alba Party&#x27;s Lothian regional list but neither he nor his party succeeded in gaining a seat.

At the 2024 general election MacAskill stood in the Alloa and Grangemouth seat. He received 1.5% of the vote share with 638 votes.

== Background, early life and career ==
MacAskill was born in Edinburgh and was educated at Linlithgow Academy before studying law at the University of Edinburgh, gaining an LLB (Hons) degree. After completing his training at a firm in Glasgow, he set up Erskine MacAskill.

He came to prominence inside the SNP through his activities in the left-wing 79 Group and became a party office bearer. In the 1980s he led the &quot;Can&#x27;t Pay, Won&#x27;t Pay&quot; campaign in opposition to the Poll Tax. It was widely known that he often disagreed politically with Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP through the 1990s, and he was at one stage viewed as belonging to the SNP Fundamentalist camp, being perceived to be allied to figures such as Jim Sillars and Alex Neil within the party.

== Member of the Scottish Parliament (1999–2016) ==
After MacAskill became an MSP in 1999 upon the establishment of the Scottish Parliament as a regional list member for the Lothians he moderated his political position, seeing the development of the Scottish Parliament as the most achievable route for Scotland to become an independent nation state. In this respect he was regarded as having adopted a gradualist approach to Scottish independence in place of his previous fundamentalist position. He was one of former SNP leader John Swinney&#x27;s closest supporters.

In 1999 MacAskill was detained in London before the Euro 2000 second leg play-off match between Scotland and England on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. As he was not charged with any crime the incident did not affect his position within the SNP and he won re-election at the 2003 election.

In 2004, after John Swinney stood down as SNP party leader, Kenny MacAskill backed the joint leadership ticket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. He had initially intended to stand for deputy leader himself on a joint ticket with Nicola Sturgeon, who would have sought the leadership. He gave way when Salmond reconsidered his earlier decision not to seek re-election to the leadership. Upon their election as leader and deputy leader respectively, MacAskill was selected to be Deputy Leader of the SNP in the Scottish Parliament. He served in the SNP Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning from 2001 to 2003, Shadow Minister for Transport and Telecommunications from 2003 to 2004 and Shadow Minister for Justice from 2004 to 2007.

MacAskill authored a book, &quot;Building a Nation – Post Devolution Nationalism in Scotland&quot;, which was launched at the SNP&#x27;s 2004 annual conference in Inverness. He has since edited another book &quot;Agenda for a New Scotland – Visions of Scotland 2020&quot;, and has co-authored &quot;Global Scots – Voices From Afar&quot; with former First Minister Henry McLeish.

=== Cabinet Secretary for Justice (2007–2014) ===
For the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, MacAskill was top of the SNP&#x27;s party list for the Lothians region. He stood in the Edinburgh East and Musselburgh constituency, winning that seat from Scottish Labour with a 13.3% swing to give a majority of 1,382. This was the first time the SNP had ever won a parliamentary seat in Edinburgh. After the SNP&#x27;s victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, MacAskill became the Cabinet Secretary for Justice.

One of MacAskill&#x27;s first acts as a cabinet secretary was to lift the ban on alcohol sales at international rugby union games held at Murrayfield Stadium.

MacAskill also said that the 2007 terror attack on Glasgow Airport was not committed by &#x27;home-grown&#x27; terrorists, in that the suspects were not &quot;born or bred&quot; in Scotland but had merely lived in the country for a &quot;period of time&quot;.

MacAskill won election to a redrawn constituency of Edinburgh Eastern in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. Despite notionally facing a deficit of 550 votes, MacAskill won by over 2,000 votes.

====Pan Am Flight 103====
On 19 August 2009, MacAskill rejected an application by Libya to transfer to their custody Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, convicted of the Pan Am Flight 103 bomb that killed 270 people, acknowledging that &quot;the American families and Government had an expectation or were led to believe that there would be no prisoner transfer.&quot; The following day, on 20 August, MacAskill authorised al-Megrahi&#x27;s release on compassionate grounds. Megrahi had served 8½ years of a life sentence, but had developed terminal prostate cancer. The Justice Secretary has discretionary authority to order such a release, and MacAskill took sole responsibility for the decision. Megrahi died on 20 May 2012.

In the United States, where 180 of the 270 victims came from, the decision met with broad hostility. Political figures including President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke out against it, and families of the victims expressed indignation over the decision. FBI director Robert Mueller, who had been a lead investigator in the 1988 bombing, wrote a highly critical open letter to MacAskill. Former Labour First Minister Henry McLeish was critical of Mueller&#x27;s attack on the decision.

In Britain, reaction was divided. Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray, former First Minister Jack McConnell, and former Scottish Office minister Brian Wilson criticised the decision, while Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, former Labour MP Tam Dalyell and former British ambassador to Libya Richard Dalton publicly supported it. Ian Galloway and Mario Conti, representatives of the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church respectively, also spoke in favour of the release.

John Mosey, a priest who lost a daughter on Pan Am Flight 103, expressed his disappointment that halting Megrahi&#x27;s appeal before it went to court meant that the public would never hear &quot;this important evidence — the six separate grounds for appeal that the SCCRC felt were important enough to put forward, that could show that there&#x27;s been a miscarriage of justice.&quot; Saif al-Islam Gaddafi reiterated his belief in Megrahi&#x27;s innocence commenting that the Justice Secretary had &quot;made the right decision&quot; and that history would prove this to be the case. A letter in support of MacAskill&#x27;s decision was sent to the Scottish Government on behalf of former South African President Nelson Mandela.

The Scottish Parliament was recalled from its summer break, for the third time since its creation, to receive a statement from and question MacAskill. The opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament passed amendments criticising the decision and the way it was made, but no motions of confidence in MacAskill or the Scottish Government were tabled.

After MacAskill won re-election to the Scottish Parliament in 2011, an SNP supporter said that the decision had been mentioned by very few voters during the election campaign.

== Member of Parliament (2019–2024) ==
MacAskill was chosen as the SNP candidate for East Lothian at the 2019 UK general election. He was subsequently elected, overturning a 3,083 majority and defeating Labour&#x27;s Martin Whitfield.

In April 2020, MacAskill called for the office of Lord Advocate to be split – similarly to the English and Welsh system of Attorney General for England and Wales and Director of Public Prosecutions – in a response to the trial of former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond, to avoid potential conflicts of interest.

In February 2020, MacAskill authored &quot;Radical Scotland – Uncovering Scotland&#x27;s radical history – from the French Revolutionary era to the 1820 Rising&quot;, published by Biteback.

Following the launch of the Alba Party in March 2021, in advance of the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, MacAskill announced that he was leaving the SNP to join Alba, making him their first sitting representative. He was reported as planning to stand for election to Holyrood in a regional list seat. The SNP called on him to resign and trigger a by-election, describing his defection as &quot;somewhat of a relief&quot;. In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, he stood on Alba&#x27;s Lothian regional list but neither he nor his party succeeded in gaining any seats. Later that year, at the party&#x27;s inaugural conference, he was elected as depute leader.

On 13 July 2022, Speaker Lindsay Hoyle ejected MacAskill and his Alba colleague Neale Hanvey (Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath) from the House of Commons for disrupting the start of Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions. The two had been protesting about the refusal to grant consent for a second referendum on Scottish independence. As both Members were named by the Speaker, by convention MacAskill and Hanvey were handed five-day suspensions from the House of Commons.

At the 2024 general election, MacAskill switched constituencies to instead stand for the new Alloa and Grangemouth seat, which was won by Brian Leishman of the Labour Party, amidst a large swing towards Labour across Scotland. MacAskill received 638 votes, 1.5% of the votes cast.

== Post-parliamentary career (2024–) ==
Following Alex Salmond&#x27;s death on 12 October 2024, MacAskill became acting leader of the Alba Party. Under the provisions of the party constitution, the depute leader of the party becomes its acting leader whenever the leadership becomes vacant. He has since announced his candidacy for the 2025 Alba Party leadership election.

== Personal life ==
MacAskill lives in Moray, where he has a house, and he also maintains a flat in East Lothian. He has two sons.

<doc id="294750" wikidata="Q333953" url="?curid=294750" title="Roseanna Cunningham">
<text>Roseanna Cunningham (born 27 July 1951) is a retired Scottish National Party (SNP) politician who served as Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform from 2016 to 2021. She was previously Cabinet Secretary for Fair Work, Skills and Training from 2014 until 2016.

She served as the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Perth from 1999 to 2011, and then for Perthshire South and Kinross-shire from 2011 to 2021. She was formerly Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth and Kinross from 1995 to 1997, then for Perth from 1997 to 2001.

==Early life, education and legal practice==
Cunningham was born on 27 July 1951 in Glasgow to Catherine and Hugh Cunningham, and spent her early years living in East Lothian and Edinburgh. In 1960, she emigrated with her family to Perth in Australia, and completed her schooling at John Curtin High School in Fremantle. As a teenager she became interested in politics, and in 1969 joined the SNP as an overseas member. In 1975 Cunningham graduated from the University of Western Australia with a BA Hons in politics. She returned to Scotland in 1976.

She worked as a research assistant at SNP headquarters from 1977 to 1979, and was a member of the left-wing 79 Group inside the SNP during the early 1980s, but avoided expulsion as she was not a member of its steering committee (future SNP leader Alex Salmond by contrast who served on the 79 Group committee was expelled, while Margo MacDonald resigned from the party in protest before she could be expelled).

Cunningham returned to university in 1980, graduating from the University of Edinburgh in 1982 with a Bachelor of Laws degree, followed in 1983 by a Diploma in Legal Practice from the University of Aberdeen. She worked as a solicitor for Dumbarton District Council and Glasgow District Council. After a brief period in private practice, she was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1990.

==Political career==
At the 1992 general election Cunningham stood in the Perth and Kinross constituency, losing by around 2,000 votes.

In 1995 she gained the seat in the Perth and Kinross by-election, succeeding the recently deceased Conservative MP, Sir Nicholas Fairbairn. She had initially been omitted from the SNP&#x27;s candidate shortlist over her brief relationship in the 1970s with Donald Bain, the then husband of SNP MP Margaret Ewing, on the grounds that the issue could prove an embarrassment to the party. Cunningham said the affair had begun after Bain and Ewing had separated. She was put back in contention following an intervention by the then party leader Alex Salmond, and after Ewing made clear she had no objection to Cunningham&#x27;s candidature. In the 1997 election, she stood for the Perth constituency and was elected.

In 1999 she became the MSP for Perth. In 2000, she was elected the SNP Senior Vice-Convener (depute leader). Also in that year, she helped establish the &quot;Scottish Left Review&quot; publication. She stood down as an MP in 2001, to concentrate on the Scottish Parliament.

John Swinney announced his resignation as leader of the SNP on 22 June 2004, and on the same day, Cunningham announced that she would be a candidate in the subsequent election for the party leadership. In the early stages of the campaign, she appeared to be the clear front-runner, but former leader Alex Salmond entered the race just before nominations closed and Cunningham finished a distant second.

In December 2006, she led an unsuccessful attempt to prevent same-sex couples from gaining the right to adopt children, despite having previously been named ScotsGay Parliamentarian of the Year in 1998. When legislation to introduce same-sex marriage in Scotland was passed by the Scottish Parliament in February 2014, she voted against the bill.

In the first reshuffle of the SNP Government in February 2009, Cunningham was appointed as Minister for the Environment. In December 2010, she also took on portfolio responsibility for climate change, becoming Minister for the Environment and Climate Change. After the 2011 election, which saw an SNP landslide, she was appointed Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs with special responsibility for tackling sectarianism.

In Nicola Sturgeon&#x27;s first reshuffle in November 2014, she was promoted to Cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Fair Work, Skills and Training.

She announced on 21 August 2020 that she would step down as an MSP in the 2021 Scottish election.

<text>The quince (; Cydonia oblonga) is the sole member of the genus Cydonia in the Malinae subtribe (which contains apples, pears, and other fruits) of the Rosaceae family. It is a deciduous tree that bears hard, aromatic bright golden-yellow pome fruit, similar in appearance to a pear. Ripe quince fruits are hard, tart, and astringent. They are eaten raw or processed into jam, quince cheese, or alcoholic drinks.

The quince tree is sometimes grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive pale pink blossoms and as a miniature bonsai plant. In ancient Greece, the word for quince was used slightly ribaldly to signify teenage breasts.

== Description ==

Quinces are shrubs or small trees up to tall and wide. Young twigs are covered in a grey down. The leaves are oval, and are downy on the underside. The solitary flowers, produced in late spring after the leaves, are white or pink.

The ripe fruit is aromatic but remains hard; gritty stone cells are dispersed through the flesh. It is larger than many apples, weighing as much as , often pear-shaped but sometimes roughly spherical.

The seeds contain nitriles, common in the seeds of the rose family. In the stomach, enzymes or stomach acid or both cause some of the nitriles to be hydrolysed and produce toxic hydrogen cyanide, which is a volatile gas. The seeds are toxic only if eaten in large quantities.

== History ==

Quince is native to the Hyrcanian forests south of the Caspian Sea. From that centre of origin it was spread radially by Neolithic farmers, 5000 to 3000 BC, to secondary centres including Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Iran, and Syria. In turn, landraces of quince were then distributed across Europe, Russia, China, India, and North Africa. It reached Britain in the 16th century. Settlers brought it to North America in the 17th century, and to Central and South America in the 18th century.

The fruit was known in the Akkadian language as &quot;supurgillu&quot;; &quot;quinces&quot; (collective plural), which was borrowed into Aramaic as &quot;sparglin&quot;; it was known in Judea during the Mishnaic Hebrew as &quot;prishin&quot; (a loanword from Jewish Palestinian Aramaic &quot;the miraculous [fruit]&quot;); quince flourished in the heat of the Mesopotamian plain, where apples did not. It was cultivated from an archaic period around the Mediterranean. Some ancients called the fruit &quot;golden apples&quot;.

The Greeks associated it with Kydonia on Crete, as the &quot;Cydonian pome&quot;, and Theophrastus, in his &quot;Enquiry into Plants&quot;, noted that quince was one of many fruiting plants that do not come true from seed.

As a sacred emblem of Aphrodite, a quince figured in a lost poem of Callimachus that survives in a prose epitome: seeing his beloved in the courtyard of the temple of Aphrodite, Acontius plucks a quince from the &quot;orchard of Aphrodite&quot;, inscribes its skin and furtively rolls it at the feet of her illiterate nurse, whose curiosity aroused, hands it to the girl to read aloud, and the girl finds herself saying &quot;I swear by Aphrodite that I will marry Acontius&quot;. A vow thus spoken in the goddess&#x27;s &quot;temenos&quot; cannot be broken. Pliny the Elder mentions &quot;numerous varieties&quot; of quince in his &quot;Natural History&quot; and describes four.

Quinces are ripe on the tree only briefly: the Roman cookbook &quot;De re coquinaria&quot; of Apicius specifies in attempting to keep quinces, to select perfect unbruised fruits and keep stems and leaves intact, submerged in honey and reduced wine.

=== Taxonomy ===

&quot;Cydonia&quot; is in the subfamily Amygdaloideae.

The modern name originated in the 14th century as a plural of &quot;quoyn&quot;, via Old French &quot;cooin&quot; from Latin &quot;cotoneum malum&quot; / &quot;cydonium malum&quot;, ultimately from Greek κυδώνιον μῆλον, &quot;kydonion melon&quot; &quot;Kydonian apple&quot;.

== Cultivation ==

Quince is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub which adapts to many soils of low to medium pH. It tolerates both shade and sun, but sunlight is required to produce larger flowers and ensure fruit ripening. It is a hardy plant that does not require much maintenance, and tolerates years without pruning or major insect and disease problems.

Quince is cultivated on all continents in warm-temperate and temperate climates. It requires a cooler period of the year, with temperatures under , to flower properly. Propagation is done by cuttings or layering; the former method produces better plants, but they take longer to mature than by the latter. Named cultivars are propagated by cuttings or layers grafted on quince rootstock. Propagation by seed is not used commercially. Quince forms thick bushes, which must be pruned and reduced into a single stem to grow fruit-bearing trees for commercial use. The tree is self-pollinated, but it produces better yields when cross-pollinated.

Fruits are typically left on the tree to ripen fully. In warmer climates, it may become soft to the point of being edible, but additional ripening may be required in cooler climates. They are harvested in late autumn, before first frosts. Quince is used as rootstock for certain pear cultivars.

In Europe, quinces are commonly grown in central and southern areas where the summers are sufficiently hot for the fruit to fully ripen. They are not grown in large amounts; typically one or two quince trees are grown in a mixed orchard with several apples and other fruit trees. In the 18th-century New England colonies, for example, there was always a quince at the lower corner of the vegetable garden, Ann Leighton notes in records of Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Newburyport, Massachusetts. Charlemagne directed that quinces be planted in well-stocked orchards. Quinces in England are first recorded in about 1275, when Edward I had some planted at the Tower of London.

=== Pests and diseases ===

Quince is subject to a variety of pest insects including aphids, scale insects, mealybugs, and moth caterpillars such as leafrollers (Tortricidae) and codling moths.

While quince is a hardy shrub, it may develop fungal diseases in hot weather, resulting in premature leaf fall. Quince leaf blight, caused by fungus &quot;Diplocarpon mespili&quot;, presents a threat in wet summers, causing severe leaf spotting and early defoliation, affecting fruit to a lesser extent. Cedar-quince rust, caused by &quot;Gymnosporangium clavipes&quot;, requires two hosts to complete its life cycle, one usually a juniper, and the other a member of the Rosaceae. Appearing as red excrescence on various parts of the plant, it may affect quinces grown near junipers.

=== Production ===

In 2021, world production of quinces was 697,563 tonnes, with Turkey and China accounting for 43% of the world total (table).

=== Cultivars ===

Quince cultivars include:

The cultivars &#x27;Vranja&#x27; Nenadovic and &#x27;Serbian Gold&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Uses ==

=== Nutrition ===

A raw quince is 84% water, 15% carbohydrates, and contains negligible fat and protein (table). In a reference amount, the fruit provides of food energy and a moderate amount of vitamin C (18% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant percentage of the Daily Value (table).

=== Culinary use ===

Quinces are appreciated for their intense aroma, flavour, and tartness. However, most varieties are too hard and tart to be eaten raw. They may be cooked or roasted and used for jams, marmalade, jellies, or pudding. A few varieties, such as &#x27;Aromatnaya&#x27; and &#x27;Kuganskaya&#x27;, can be eaten raw. High in pectin, they are used to make jam, jelly and quince pudding, or they may be peeled, then roasted, baked or stewed; pectin levels diminish as the fruit ripens. Long cooking with sugar turns the flesh of the fruit red due to the presence of pigmented anthocyanins.

The strong flavour means they can be added in small quantities to apple pies and jam. Adding a diced quince to apple sauce enhances the taste of the apple sauce. The term &quot;marmalade&quot;, originally meaning a quince jam, derives from &quot;&quot;, the Portuguese word for this fruit.

Quince cheese or quince jelly originated from the Iberian peninsula and is a firm, sticky, sweet reddish hard paste made by slowly cooking down the quince fruit with sugar. It is called in the Spanish-speaking world, where it is eaten with manchego cheese.

Quince is used in the Levant, especially in Syria. It is added to either chicken or kibbeh to create an intense and unique taste such as with kibbeh safarjaliyeh.

=== Alcoholic drink ===

In the Balkans, quince eau-de-vie (rakija) is made. Ripe fruits of sweeter varieties are washed and cleared of rot and seeds, then crushed or minced, mixed with cold or boiling sweetened water and yeast, and left for several weeks to ferment. The fermented mash is distilled once, obtaining a 20–30 ABV, or twice, producing an approximately 60% ABV liquor. The two distillates may be mixed or diluted with distilled water to obtain the final product, containing 42–43% ABV.

In the Alsace region of France and the Valais region of Switzerland, &quot;liqueur de coing&quot; made from quince is used as a &quot;digestif&quot;.

In Carolina in 1709, John Lawson allowed that he was &quot;not a fair judge of the different sorts of Quinces, which they call Brunswick, Portugal and Barbary&quot;, but he noted &quot;of this fruit they make a wine or liquor which they call Quince-Drink, and which I approve of beyond any that their country affords, though a great deal of cider and perry is there made, The Quince-Drink most commonly purges.&quot;

== Cultural associations ==

Ancient Greek poets such as Ibycus and Aristophanes used quinces (&quot;kydonia&quot;) as a mildly ribald term for teenage breasts.
In Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;, Solon is said to have decreed that &quot;bride and bridegroom shall be shut into a chamber, and eat a quince together.&quot; The hero Hercules is associated with golden apples; these are thought by some scholars probably to have been quinces. When a baby is born in the Balkans, a quince tree is planted as a symbol of fertility, love and life. Edward Lear&#x27;s 1870 nonsense poem &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; contains the lines

Kate Young writes in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the poem may be nonsense, but that slices of quince work well with a meringue and whipped cream dessert.

<text>Zgorzelec (, , , ) is a town in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in southwestern Poland, with 30,374 inhabitants (2019). It is the seat of Zgorzelec County and of Gmina Zgorzelec (although it is not part of the territory of the latter, as the town is an urban gmina in its own right).

Zgorzelec is located on the Lusatian Neisse river, on the Polish-German border adjoining the German town of Görlitz, of which it constituted the eastern part up to 1945. Through its history it has been at various times under German, Polish, Czech and Hungarian rule. In recent history, it became known as the location of a major German-operated prisoner-of-war camp for Allied soldiers of various nationalities during World War II, the place of signing of the Treaty of Zgorzelec, and the home of the successful Turów Zgorzelec basketball team, which played in the Euroleague and EuroCup.

==History==
Up until 1945, the modern-day towns of Zgorzelec and Görlitz were a single entity; their history up to that point is shared. The date of the town&#x27;s foundation is unknown.

===Middle Ages===
In the Early Middle Ages, the area was inhabited by the Bieżuńczanie tribe, one of the old Polish tribes, which together with the Sorbian Milceni tribe, with which it bordered in the west, was subjugated in 990 by the Margraviate of Meissen, a frontier march of the Holy Roman Empire. It was conquered by Polish Duke, and future King, Bolesław I the Brave in 1002, whose goal was to decisively unite all Polish tribes, and remained part of Poland during the reign of the first Polish kings Bolesław I the Brave and Mieszko II Lambert until 1031, when the region fell again to the Margraviate of Meissen. Zgorzelec/Görlitz was first mentioned in a document from the King of Germany, and later Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV in 1071 as a small village named Goreliz in the region of Upper Lusatia. In 1075, the region came under the rule of the Duchy of Bohemia (kingdom from 1198). In the 13th century the village gradually turned into a town. It became rich due to its location on the Via Regia, an ancient and medieval trade road. In 1319 it became part of the Piast-ruled Duchy of Jawor, the southwesternmost duchy of fragmented Poland, and later on, became part of Bohemia again.

In the following centuries, from 1346, it was a wealthy member of the Six-City League of Upper Lusatia, consisting of the six Lusatian cities Bautzen, Görlitz, Kamenz, Lubań, Löbau and Zittau. The town of Gorlice in southern Poland was founded during the reign of Casimir the Great in 1354 by ethnic German colonists from Görlitz, in the last phases of eastward settlement by Germans (in this case by Walddeutsche). In 1469, along with the Lusatian League, the town recognized the rule of King Matthias Corvinus and passed to Hungary, and in 1490 it fell back to Bohemia then ruled by Polish prince Vladislaus Jagiellon. The town brokered international trade between German states in the west and Poland, Lithuania, Hungary and Muscovy in the east, and in 1510 King Sigismund I the Old allowed free trade in all of Poland and Lithuania for the town.

===Modern period===

After suffering for years in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the region of Upper Lusatia (including Görlitz) passed to Saxony (1635), whose Electors were also Kings of Poland from 1697. One of the two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the city at that time.

In 1815, after the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna awarded Görlitz to the Kingdom of Prussia and subsequently the city became part of the German Empire in 1871. The city was a part of the Prussian province of Silesia from 1815 to 1919.

===20th century===
During World War I, the Germans operated a prisoner-of-war camp in present-day Zgorzelec, in which initially Russian, French and British POWs were held, and then from 1916 to 1919 around 6,500 Greek soldiers were interned. After the abolition of the Kingdom of Prussia in the aftermath of World War I, Görlitz became a part of the newly established Province of Lower Silesia in the Free State of Prussia.
On 26 August 1939, a few days before Germany invaded Poland and sparked World War II, a temporary prisoner-of-war camp intended for Poles was established in present-day Zgorzelec, which was soon converted into the large Stalag VIII-A POW camp. The first 8,000 Polish POWs were brought to the camp on 7 September 1939. Also Polish civilians, including women, were held in the camp, which served as a transit camp for Poles, who were deported to Germany either to forced labour or to Nazi concentration camps. Among them were especially Polish activists and intelligentsia from Silesia, Greater Poland and Pomerania, arrested during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. After being brought to the town in freight trains, the prisoners were marched from the train station to the camp, while the local German population and Hitler Youth stood in lines and insulted them. Poor sanitary conditions led to frequent epidemic outbreaks in the camp. During the war also POWs of various other nationalities were held in the camp, including the Czechs, Lithuanians, Jews, French, Belgians, Russians, Italians, Britons, Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans, Yugoslavs, Slovaks, Americans. The French composer Olivier Messiaen was one of its inmates. Most POWs were evacuated by the Germans in February 1945 in a death march, during which POWs who either were unable to walk or tried to escape were murdered. In November 1941, also the Stalag 368 POW camp was founded in the town, but was relocated to Beniaminów in the following months.

In the wake of German defeat, operation groups arrived in the town on 10 to 12 May 1945 on the right Oder bank of Görlitz to secure Polish takeover of the town district. Polish administration was officially implemented on 21 May. On 2 June 1945, Polish military closed the bridge in Görlitz to block Germans from returning to their homes in Silesia. Early in the morning on 21 June, the Polish ordered the Germans to leave their homes on the eastern part of Görlitz.

The Potsdam Conference confirmed Polish rule and henceforth, the Oder-Neisse line as the Polish-East German border divided Görlitz (lying on the Lusatian Neisse) between the two countries. The German part retained the name Görlitz, while the Polish part was initially known by its other historic Polish name Zgorzelice, later changed to the also historic name Zgorzelec. Polish and Greek settlers arrived in the town. Zgorzelec had a difficult start as a Polish town because almost all of the infrastructure facilities were located in the part remaining German. The Treaty of Zgorzelec, between Poland and East Germany, was signed in the town&#x27;s community center in 1950.

Starting in 1948, some 10,000 Greek refugees of the Greek Civil War, mainly communist partisans, were allowed into Poland and settled mainly in Zgorzelec. There were Greek schools, a Greek retirement home, and even a factory reserved for Greek employees. The majority of these refugees later returned to Greece, but a part remains to this day (see Greeks in Poland). The Greek community of Zgorzelec was instrumental in the building of The Orthodox Church of Saints Constantine and Helen in 2002. Since 1999, an annual international Greek Song Festival has been held in Zgorzelec.

In 1972, the Polish-East German border was opened for visa-free travel, resulting in intense movement between Zgorzelec and Görlitz, which lasted until 1980, when East Germany unilaterally closed the border due to anti-communist protests and the emergence of the Solidarity movement in Poland. Until 1975 Zgorzelec was administratively located in the Wrocław (Lower Silesian) Voivodeship, and in 1975–1998 it was located in the Jelenia Góra Voivodeship.

===Recent history===

Since the fall of communism in 1989, Zgorzelec and Görlitz have developed a close political relationship. Two of the numerous bridges over the Neisse river that had been blown up by retreating German forces in World War II have been rebuilt, reconnecting the two towns with one bus line. There is also common urban management and annual common sessions of both town councils. In 2006 the towns jointly applied to be the European Capital of Culture in 2010. It was hoped that the jury would be convinced by the concept of Polish-German cooperation, but the award fell to Essen, with Görlitz/Zgorzelec in second place.

<text>Gihwa (, 1376–1433), also known as Hamheo Teuktong was a Buddhist monk of Korean Seon and leading Buddhist figure during the late Goryeo to early Joseon eras. He was originally a Confucian scholar of high reputation, but converted to Buddhism at the age of 21 upon the death of a close friend. He wandered among the Korean mountain monasteries, until he had the fortune of becoming the disciple of the last Korean national teacher, Muhak.

Gihwa&#x27;s writings showed a distinctive mixture between iconoclastic and subitist Seon language, and a strong appreciation for the scriptural tradition. Thus, he took up from Jinul the tradition of unification of Seon and Gyo Buddhism. Among his writings, there are four works in particular that made a deep impact on the subsequent Seon tradition in Korea. These are:
# A commentary on the &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot;, the &quot;Weongak gyeong hae seorui&quot;.
# A redaction and subcommentary to five famous earlier commentaries on the &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Geumgang banyabaramilgyeong ogahae seorui&quot;.
# A subcommentary and redaction of the &quot;Collection of Yongjia&quot;, the &quot;Yonggajip gwaju seorui&quot;
# The &quot;Hyeonjeong non&quot;

As a result of his fourth major work, the &quot;Hyeonjeong non&quot;, Gihwa distinguished himself as the primary Buddhist respondent to the rising Neo-Confucian polemic of his period, as he responded with vigor to the Neo-Confucian criticisms of Buddhism.

Gihwa died while residing at Jeongsusa, at the southern tip of Ganghwado, where his tomb can still be visited. Gihwa&#x27;s commentary on the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment was translated by A. Charles Muller, in 1999.

Essence-Function is a key concept in East Asian Buddhism and particularly that of Korean Buddhism. Essence-Function takes a particular form in the philosophy and writings of Kihwa.

== Biography ==
At the age of 21, he entered Uisangam in Gwanaksan and became a Buddhist monk. The following year, he learned a Buddhist service from Jacho of . After that, he returned from a trip to famous mountains across the country and devoted himself to ascetic practice.

<doc id="294765" wikidata="Q3121475" url="?curid=294765" title="Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment">
<text>The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment or Complete Enlightenment () is a Mahāyāna Buddhist sūtra highly esteemed by both the Huayan and Zen schools. The earliest records are in Chinese, and it is believed to be of Chinese origin.

Divided into twelve chapters as a series of discussions on meditation practice, this text deals with issues such as the meaning and origin of ignorance, sudden and gradual enlightenment, original Buddhahood, etc. these themes were also elucidated in the &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;. It was intended to resolve questions regarding doctrine and meditation for the earliest practitioners of the Chan school. The most important commentary is the 9th-century &quot;Great Exegesis on the Sutra of Complete Enlightenment&quot; (圓覺經大疏鈔 &quot;Yuanjuejing Dashuchao&quot;) by Zongmi.

==Titles==
Its full Chinese title: (, ).

Its reconstructed title in Sanskrit is &quot;Mahāvaipulya pūrṇabuddha-sūtra prasannārtha-sūtra&quot;.

== History ==
Its translation into Chinese is traditionally attributed to Buddhatrāta, an Indian or Kashmiri monk otherwise unattested in history, who translated the work from Sanskrit in 693 in the White Horse Temple of Luoyang. Some scholars, however, believe it to be Chinese in origin and written in the late 7th or early 8th century CE. It is considered a creative reformulation that assembles the teaching from the &quot;Shurangama Sutra&quot; and &quot;Awakening of Faith&quot;, which are also texts whose origin has been scrutinized.

==Summary==
The &quot;Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment&quot; is arranged in twelve chapters, plus a short introductory section. The introductory section describes the scene of the sermon and lists the major participants. The location is a state of deep meditative concentration (&quot;samadhi&quot;) and the participants are the Buddha and one hundred thousand great bodhisattvas, among whom twelve eminent bodhisattvas act as spokesmen. Each one of the twelve gets up one by one and asks the Buddha a set of questions about doctrine, practice and enlightenment. The structure of the sutra is such that the most &quot;essential&quot; and suddenistic discussions occur in the earlier chapters and the more &quot;functional&quot; and gradualistic dialogues occur later.

This kind of structure reflects a motif associated with the doctrine of the Huayan school, which affirms that the Buddha delivered the abstruse &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; (華嚴經 ‘Huayan Scripture’) as his first sermon, in an effort to directly awaken those whose &quot;roots of virtue&quot; were well-matured. The terminology that Zongmi and Gihwa use to describe these advanced practitioners is that they possess the capacity for the teaching of &quot;sudden enlightenment&quot;; a direct awakening to the non-duality of reality, which necessarily precludes gradualist, &quot;goal-oriented&quot; practice. In the first two chapters (the chapters of Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra), the Buddha holds very strictly to the sudden position, denying the possibility of enlightenment through gradual practice. In the third chapter he begins to allow for a bit of a gradual view, and the next several chapters become mixtures of the two. The final few chapters offer a fully gradualist perspective.

Gihwa&#x27;s primary means of categorization of the chapters is according to the &quot;three capacities&quot; of practitioners: superior, middling and inferior. According to Gihwa, the first three chapters are aimed at those of superior capacity, the next seven for those of middling capacity and the final two for those of inferior capacity. However, this method of categorization does not necessarily mean that the later chapters become gradually easier to read and understand. In fact some of the most difficult discussions come in the later chapters. Most notable in this regard is the discussion of the &quot;four traces&quot; of Self, Person, Sentient Being and Life in Chapter Nine. Since the distinction between each of these four is extremely subtle, and the wording of the text itself is not that clear, this turns out to be one of the most difficult chapters to digest.

<text>Red Bull Flugtag (, &#x27;airshow&#x27; ) is an event organized by Red Bull in which competitors attempt to fly home-made, human-powered flying machines, size-limited to around and weight-limited to approximately . The flying machines are usually launched off a pier about high into the sea or body of water. Most competitors enter for the entertainment value, and the flying machines rarely fly at all.

==Background==
The format was originally invented in Selsey, a small seaside town in the south of England under the name &quot;Birdman Rally&quot; in 1971. The first Red Bull Flugtag competition was held in 1992 in Vienna, Austria. It was such a success that it has been held every year since and in over 35 cities all over the world.

Anyone is eligible to compete in the Flugtag event. To participate, each team must submit an application and their contraption must meet the criteria set forth by Red Bull. The criteria vary with location. In the United States each flying machine must have a maximum wingspan of and a maximum weight (including pilot) of . In Australian Flugtags the wingspan is limited to and the weight (not including pilot) to . The craft must be powered by muscle, gravity, and imagination. Because the aircraft will ultimately end up in the water, it must be unsinkable and constructed entirely of environmentally friendly materials. The aircraft may not have any loose parts and advertising space is limited to .

==World records==

===Distance===

The record for the longest flight is 258 feet (78.6 m), set on September 21, 2013, at the Flugtag in Long Beach, California, by &quot;The Chicken Whisperers&quot; team in front of a crowd of 110,000.

===Attendance===

The largest crowd was in Cape Town, South Africa with 220,000 attending in 2012.

==Results==

Teams that enter the competition are judged according to three criteria: distance, creativity, and showmanship.

<doc id="294768" wikidata="Q1133954" url="?curid=294768" title="Divemaster">
<text>A divemaster (DM) is a role that includes organising and leading recreational dives, particularly in a professional capacity, and is a qualification used in many parts of the world in recreational scuba diving for a diver who has supervisory responsibility for a group of divers and as a dive guide. As well as being a generic term, &#x27;Divemaster&#x27; is the title of the first professional rating of many training agencies, such as PADI, SSI, SDI, NASE, except NAUI, which rates a NAUI Divemaster under a NAUI Instructor but above a NAUI Assistant Instructor. The divemaster certification is generally equivalent to the requirements of ISO 24801-3 Dive Leader.

The British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) recognizes several agencies&#x27; divemaster certificates as equivalent to BSAC Dive Leader, but not to BSAC Advanced Diver. The converse may not be true.

The certification is a prerequisite for training as an instructor in recreational diving with the professional agencies except NAUI, where it is an optional step, because of the different position of the NAUI Divemaster in the NAUI hierarchy.

==Role==

The role of a divemaster may vary, but will generally include the following roles:
* Organizing, conducting and supervising recreational diving activities (but not training), both shore and boat based.
* Assisting instructors in conducting training programs and activities for certified divers.
* Generally supervising non-training related diving activities by planning, organizing and directing dives.
**assessing the hazards of a dive site and informing the divers of the hazards,
**briefing divers on the layout and points of interest of a dive site,
**suggesting routes for a dive at a specific site for autonomous divers,
**checking divers into and out of the water from a boat or shore entry point,
**leading a group of divers in the water as a tour guide.
* Within the limits of some agencies, divemasters may:
** act as instructional assistants to instructors.
** supervise participants in experience programs for uncertified divers.
** teach and certify skin divers and snorkellers.
** conduct scuba review programs for certified divers.

==Responsibility and legal position==
The legal duty of care of a divemaster to a client varies according to the legislation of the country, where it is often poorly defined. The use of waivers and/or assumption of risk forms that are intended to minimize legal accountability of divemasters is a common practice, but the validity of such waivers will vary with the legislation. If a divemaster provides safety information to a group of divers or professionally advises them regarding a dive site they may incur a duty of care to those divers.

==Equivalence of certification== 
The following certifications are recognised as meeting or exceeding the requirements of EN/ISO 24801-3:2014:
*ACUC Divemaster
*ANDI Divemaster
*BSAC Dive Leader
*CMAS 3-star Diver
*DMT NASE Divemaster
*IANTD Divemaster
*NASDS Dive Supervisor
*NAUI Divemaster
*PADI Divemaster
*ProTec Dive Master
*PSAI Divemaster
*SAA Dive Leader(?), Dive Supervisor
*SDI Divemaster
*SNSI Divemaster
*SSI Dive Guide

==Equivalence in other fields of diving==
===Technical diving===
In technical diving, divers are assumed to be competent and responsible for their own safety or the safety of the team of which they are members to the extent that is agreed by that team. It is not unusual for a technical team or expedition group to appoint one of their number as a team leader or surface dive marshall, but the surface marshall is often more of an administrative position, who will check divers into and out of the water, and the dive team leader is more the navigator, or the person in front of the group than someone making safety decisions for other divers. Most technical divers follow the principle that any diver may call an end to a dive at any time for any reason, and that the team will comply, following the previously agreed termination procedure.

NAUI has a Technical Support Leader course that is designed to train NAUI Divemasters and Assistant Instructors who are also technical divers in this role.

===Professional diving===
Professional divers generally work in teams which have one or more divers in the water and a supervisor on the surface, with one or more assistants for handling lifelines, umbilicals, communications, gas panels and other support equipment, and a who is responsible for assisting or rescuing the in-water divers in an emergency. In these circumstances the supervisor has a high and legally defined level of responsibility for the safety of the dive team and anyone else on site.

==Employment opportunities and conditions==
Divemasters have the ability to work in holiday destinations in many parts of the world. They may work in diving resorts, private yachts, cruise ships and dive centres – anywhere where there is a demand for organised recreational diving.

Many divemasters also work in retail dive facilities and assist the instructor with training and supervision.

== Training ==
During Divemaster training, candidates learn dive leadership skills through classroom, independent study and practical training exercises. Some Divemaster programs require an internship program too. They complete water skills and stamina exercises, training exercises that improve their ability to organize and solve problems and help others to improve their abilities.

Candidates put this knowledge into action through a structured internship or a series of practical training exercises, including the candidate assisting in actual diving programs with real diving students.

Divers can develop to divemaster level through two different methods. Either through progressing along the recreational levels of diving, or through divemaster internships that fast-track the candidate to divemaster level by having them become involved in the training facility where they are training. Divemaster internships are offered by many different dive shops under their respective organizations( PADI, NAUI, SSI, etc.)The internship program allows the divemaster candidate to not only complete the minimum learning requirements, but to also &quot;&quot; and practice what has been learned.

===Prerequisites for training===

PADI and SDI Divemaster candidates must have reached the following minimum requirements prior to their divemaster training:
* Advanced Open Water Diver certification (or qualifying certification from another training organization)
* Rescue Diver certification (or qualifying certification from another training organization)
* First Aid &amp; CPR training (preferably with automated external defibrillator (AED) training)
* 40 logged dives 
* Submit a medical statement signed by a physician within the last 12 months. 
NASE requires divemaster candidates to also have demonstrated competency in physics, physiology, skills and environment, dive planning and equipment prior to entering a program. 

PADI Divemaster candidates must have completed 60 logged dives prior to certification.

==== NAUI ====
Divemaster is a NAUI leadership-level certification between Assistant Instructor and Instructor, in contrast to agencies such as PADI that rate divemaster as the lowest level of leadership qualification. A NAUI Divemaster may organize and conduct dives for certified divers and is qualified to assist active-status NAUI Instructors on diver training courses.

NAUI provides a core of leadership-level skills and knowledge in the NAUI Master Scuba Diver and NAUI Scuba Rescue Diver courses, which are necessary prerequisites for all NAUI leadership programs. Divemaster candidates who offer equivalent certification must still pass the NAUI Master Scuba Diver written examination. Divemaster candidates must either hold a NAUI Assistant Instructor qualification, or have a minimum of 60 logged open water dives demonstrating varied environment, depth and activities, as well as waterskills equal to those expected of an Assistant Instructor.

Holding a NAUI Divemaster certificate is one of three ways in which the diver certification requirements for a NAUI Instructor Training Course may be met.

<text>Asian cuisine encompasses several significant regional cooking styles of Asia: Central Asian, East Asian, North Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian. Cuisine is a distinctive way of cooking practices and customs, usually associated with a specific culture. Asia, as the largest and most populous continent, is home to many cultures, each with its own characteristic cuisine. Asian cuisine, also known as Eastern cuisine, is considered the &quot;culture of food within a society&quot; due to the beliefs, cooking methods, and the specific ingredients used throughout the entire process. Asian cuisines are also renowned for their spices. A key taste factor in Asian cuisine is “umami” flavor, a strong savoriness prominent in Asian cooking, which can be achieved through fermented food or meat extract.

Ingredients common to many cultures in East and Southeast Asia include rice, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, chilis, dried onions, soy, and tofu. Stir frying, steaming, and deep frying are common cooking methods.

While rice is common to most Asian cuisines, different varieties are popular in the various regions. Glutinous rice is ingrained in the culture, religious tradition and national identity of Laos. Basmati rice is popular in the Indian subcontinent, jasmine rice is often found across Southeast Asia, while long-grain rice is popular in China and short-grain in Japan and Korea.

Curry is a common dish in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. Curry dishes have their origins in the Indian subcontinent. Countries in Indochina typically use a coconut milk base in their curries; countries in Southwest Asia typically use a yogurt base.

== Historical timeline ==

A heavily influential aspect of Asian culture is the food, especially the various traditional ways of Asian cuisine and cooking. Although many Asian cultures often share the traditions of bringing the family or group together to socialize or have celebrations over a meal, the various cultures of Asia each developed their own individual ethnic cultural takes on food through the interaction of history, culture, and environment. Asian cuisine is often associated with multiculturalism with specific foods linked to many different cultures.

== Central Asian cuisine ==
Most Central Asian nations have similar cuisines to each other as well as their neighbors, taking many features of the neighboring cuisines of West and East Asia, particularly Iran and Mongolia. A dish known as &quot;plov&quot;, or &quot;osh&quot;, for example, is a widespread variation of pilaf. However, many of the same countries use horse meat and mutton as the most common meats, similar to beef. This is owing to Mongolian cuisine. In Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, the cuisine has evolved to meet the needs of a nomad lifestyle.

Kumis is a widespread drink among Turkic peoples, especially in Central Asia.

Central Asia is also noted for being the birthplace of yogurt. Like kumis, it is widespread among Turkic peoples.

== East Asian cuisine ==
East Asian cuisine includes Chinese, Hong Kong, Japanese, Korean, Macanese, Mongolian, Taiwanese, and Tibetan food. Considering this is the most populated region of the world, it has many regional cuisines (especially in China). Examples of staple foods include rice, noodles, mung beans, soybeans, seafood (Japan has the highest per capita consumption of seafood), mutton (Mongolia), bok choy (Chinese cabbage), and tea.

== North Asian cuisine==

North Asian cuisine is often synonymous with Russian cuisine, due to all of North Asia being a part of the Russian Federation. However, some cultures or areas of Siberia have in-depth cuisine, such as the Yakuts (or Sakha) and Yamal cuisine. Buryats also have their own cuisine, although it is very similar to that of the related Mongolians.

Pelmeni, originally a Permic or Ugric dish, has entered into mainstream Russian cuisine as a well-known dish, but it can still be considered part of the Yamal cuisine for its area of origin. Some speculate them to be a simplified version of the Chinese wonton. In Siberia, pelmeni is frozen outdoors to preserve the meat inside throughout the long winter. In Yamal, other types of drying and preservation are common. Key ingredients in most northern Siberian cuisine include fish and cowberries, sometimes known as lingonberries in Europe and North America. Yakuts, like many other Turkic-speaking peoples, traditionally enjoy kumis as a common drink.

== South Asian cuisine ==
South Asian cuisine includes cuisines from the Indian subcontinent. Food items in this region are generally rich in spices, however it also caters a blend of multi-cuisine culture from all across the world. Food is flavored with various types of chili, black pepper, cloves, condiments and other herbs and spices. Use of flavored butter and ghee is prominent in many places. Turmeric, coriander, and cumin are often used to make curries.

The multitude is inclined more towards the usage of mustard, groundnut, sunflower and soybean oil for cooking. Usage of refined oil to make pooris is quite famous. Poori Bhaji, Idli, Dosa, Dal Baati, Litti Chokha are among the most popular and representative dishes of Indian cuisines.

Vegetables are generally eaten with a type of bread called Chapati which is the staple food of the region. Rice is generally taken with dal to moisten it in the northern parts and with curd as you move towards the southern region. 

Tea and coffee are prominent all across with the former available at every street corner. Egg dishes are also available in similar fashion.

Common meats include lamb, goat, fish, and chicken. Beef is less common than in Western cuisines because cattle have a special place in Hinduism. Prohibitions against beef extend to the meat of cows, and yaks to some extent. Pork is considered a taboo food item by all Muslims and is avoided by some Hindus. Other minorities also prohibit the use of meat to abjure violence. Fish is commonly used in South India, Sri Lanka and the Bengal region, i.e. Bangladesh and the West Bengal state of India. The Northern region diet mostly consists of wheat and other major crops.

== Southeast Asian cuisine ==
Southeast Asian cuisine includes a strong emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with a strong aromatic component that features such flavors as citrus and herbs such as lime, coriander/cilantro and basil. Ingredients in the region contrast with the ones in the East Asian cuisines, substituting fish sauces for sauce and the inclusion of ingredients such as galangal, tamarind and lemongrass. Cooking methods include a balance of stir-frying, boiling and steaming.

== West Asian cuisine ==
West Asian cuisine significantly overlaps with the Middle Eastern cuisine and the inclusion of the South Caucasus.

West Asian cuisine is the cuisine of the various countries and peoples of West Asia. The cuisine of the region is diverse while having a degree of homogeneity. Some commonly used ingredients include olives and olive oil, pitas, honey, sesame seeds, dates, sumac, chickpeas, mint and parsley. Some popular dishes include kibbeh and shawarma.

Cereals constitute the basis of West Asian diet, both historically and today. Wheat and rice are the major and preferred sources of staple foods. Barley is also widely used in the region and maize has become common in some areas as well. Bread is a universal staple, eaten in one form or another by all classes and groups practically at every meal.

Butter and clarified butter (also known as Semna) are, traditionally, the preferred medium of cooking. Olive oil is prevalent in the Mediterranean coastal areas. Christians use it during Lent, when meat and dairy products are excluded, and Jews use it in place of animal fats such as butter to avoid mixing meat and dairy products.

Lamb and mutton have always been the favored meats of West Asia. Pork is prohibited in both Islam and Judaism, and as such is rarely eaten in the region. Prominent among the meat preparations are grilled meats, or kebabs. Meat and vegetable stews, served with rice, bulgur, or bread, are another form of meat preparation in the region.

Vegetables and pulses are the predominant staples of the great majority of the people in the West Asia. They are boiled, stewed, grilled, stuffed, and cooked with meat and rice. Among the green leafy vegetables, many varieties of cabbage, spinach, and chard are widely used. Root and bulb vegetables, such as onions and garlic, as well as carrots, turnips, and beets are equally common.

<doc id="294781" wikidata="Q668699" url="?curid=294781" title="POUM">
<text>The Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (, POUM; , POUM) was a Spanish communist party formed during the Second Republic and mainly active around the Spanish Civil War. It was formed by the fusion of the Trotskyist Communist Left of Spain () and the Workers and Peasants&#x27; Bloc (BOC, affiliated with the Right Opposition) against the will of Leon Trotsky, with whom the former broke.

==Formation==
In 1935, POUM was formed as a communist opposition to the Stalinist form of communism promoted by the Soviet Union, by the revolutionaries Andreu Nin and Joaquín Maurín. Nin was heavily influenced by the thinking of Leon Trotsky, particularly his permanent revolution thesis. It resulted from the merging of the Communist Party&#x27;s Left Opposition (the Trotskyist Communist Left of Spain) and the Right Opposition (the Workers and Peasants&#x27; Bloc). This alliance was against the wishes of Trotsky, with whom the Communist Left of Spain broke. In his writings on the Spanish Revolution, Trotsky would elaborate on his overall criticisms of the POUM such as their abandonment of the Left Opposition program in favour of reformism to retain tactical advantage among other political tendencies.

==Position==

The party grew larger than the official Communist Party of Spain (PCE) both nationally and in the communist hotbeds of Catalonia and the Valencian Country, where the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) represented the PCE. The POUM was highly critical of the popular front strategy advocated by Joseph Stalin and the Communist International (Comintern); nevertheless, it participated in the Spanish Popular Front initiated by Manuel Azaña, leader of Acción Republicana. The POUM attempted to implement some of its radical policies as part of the Popular Front government, but they were resisted by the more centrist factions.

George Orwell, who fought alongside the POUM in the civil war, reports that its membership was roughly 10,000 in July 1936, 70,000 in December 1936, and 40,000 in June 1937, although he notes that the numbers are from POUM sources and are probably exaggerated.

==Conflict with the PCE and PSUC==
The POUM&#x27;s independent communist position, including opposition to Stalin, caused huge ruptures with the PCE, which remained fiercely loyal to the Comintern. Moreover, these divisions, which included accusations of Trotskyism (and even fascism) by the communists, resulted in actual fighting between their supporters; most notably, in 1937, a primarily communist coalition of government forces attacked the POUM during the Barcelona May Days. While the larger Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour, CNT) supported the POUM at first, the moderate leadership of the CNT dropped its support after it joined the government. Radical elements within the anarchist movement however fought side by side in the streets of Barcelona during the May Days and were isolated as well, like the Friends of Durruti. The POUM, along with the purely Trotskyist Seccion Bolshevik-Leninista, became isolated, and both organizations were driven underground. Nin was detained and presumably tortured to death by NKVD agents in Alcalá de Henares, Nin and his party were consistently labeled as provocateurs in Stalinist propaganda.

==International links==
The POUM was a member of the London Bureau of socialist and centrist Marxist parties that rejected both the reformism of the Second International and the pro-Moscow orientation of the Comintern. Other members included the Independent Labour Party in Britain, the Workers and Peasants&#x27; Socialist Party (PSOP) in France, and Poale Zion. Its youth wing was affiliated to the International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations, through which it recruited the ILP Contingent in the Civil War. Foreign supporters of POUM during the Civil War included Lois Orr.

==Transition era==
During the Spanish transition to democracy, the POUM was legalized in 1977. This led to a split in the party, with one faction opposing formal legalization, calling for a boycott of the 1977 general election and demanding the immediate restoration of the republic. The legalized party participated in the election as part of the Front for Workers&#x27; Unity (FUT), a coalition of parties and organisations to the left of the PCE which won 0.22% of the nationwide vote. The election result led to a crisis for the POUM as well as for most parties to the left of the PCE, from which it was not able to recover. 

The POUM continued to exist as a small party with an office in Barcelona and a monthly newspaper, &quot;La Batalla&quot;, calling for cooperation among the various far-left parties, but an attempted merger with Communist Action and the Collective for Marxist Unification failed during a &quot;Unification Congress&quot; in 1978. After this setback, the POUM decided not to participate in the 1979 elections. POUM branches in several cities became part of local coalitions and unification attempts with various far-left groups. In 1980, the POUM made its last electoral efforts, supporting Herri Batasuna in the Basque country and participating in the Left Bloc for National Liberation (BEAN - Unitat Popular) coalition in the Catalan parliamentary election, but the party was disintegrating. &quot;La Batalla&quot; ceased publication in May 1980, marking the end of the POUM as an organized party, though it was never officially dissolved. As a last remnant, the Valencia branch remained active until 1981. Former members of the POUM formed the Fundación Andreu Nin (Andreu Nin Foundation) to preserve the heritage of their party and ideological current.

==Cultural references==
British author George Orwell fought alongside members of the Independent Labour Party as part of POUM militias; he recounted the experience in his book &quot;Homage to Catalonia.&quot; Likewise, the film &quot;Land and Freedom&quot;, directed by Ken Loach, tells of a group of POUM soldiers fighting in the war from the perspective of a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain who initially fought for the POUM before he later joined his CPGB comrades in the International Brigades. In particular, the film goes on to deal with his disillusionment with the Soviet Union&#x27;s policies in the war while he was fighting with the International Brigades, after which he decided to return to his POUM comrades shortly before the POUM&#x27;s June 1937 suppression.

The POUM is briefly mentioned in Joe Haldeman&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;The Forever War&quot; as a militia where &quot;(y)ou obeyed an order only after it had been explained in detail; you could refuse if it didn&#x27;t make sense.&quot;

Victor Serge dedicates &quot;Midnight in the Century&quot; to Andreu Nin and other slain leaders of the POUM.

Discussion of POUM in Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (Collier edition, p. 247).

In William Herrick&#x27;s novel &quot;Hermanos!&quot;, the American communist protagonist comes to Spain in order to fight Fascism, but gets diverted into hunting down members of POUM. The POUM activists which the protagonist tortures and executes are depicted very sympathetically, shown bravely defiant and sticking to their positions to the bitter end - eventually causing the protagonist to undergo a crisis of conscience, break with the Party and become a dissident himself.

Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (Signet edition, p. 50) states that Rosa Klebb infiltrated the POUM and may have murdered Andrés Nin Pérez.

In Margaret Atwood&#x27;s prize-winning novel, &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot;, a fictional newspaper account details the actual battles between the POUM and the Stalin-backed communists in Barcelona; the title of the newspaper article is &quot;Red Vendetta in Barcelona&quot; and mentions the purges against the POUM by Stalinist communists &quot;well armed by Russia&quot;.

<doc id="294783" wikidata="Q1804894" url="?curid=294783" title="Langdon Cheves">
<text>Langdon Cheves ( September 17, 1776 – June 26, 1857) was an American politician, lawyer and businessman from South Carolina. He represented the city of Charleston in the United States House of Representatives from 1810 to 1815, where he played a key role on the home front of the War of 1812. Cheves was a leader among the War Hawk faction of the House. He served as chairman of the Committees on Naval Affairs and Ways and Means under Speaker of the House Henry Clay, then succeeded Clay as Speaker in the war&#x27;s final stages. After leaving the House, he served as President of the Second Bank of the United States from 1819 to 1823.

After leaving public office, Cheves was an active advocate for unified Southern resistance to protective tariffs and any attempt to abolish slavery, though an opponent of unilateral action by South Carolina or any one state. Originally, Cheves advocated for a convention of Southern states to pressure Congress into adopting these positions, but eventually became one of the earliest advocates for outright regional secession from the United States.

==Early life==
Langdon Cheves was born on September 17, 1776, at Bulltown Fort, on the Rocky River in South Carolina. His father, Alexander, was a native of Buchan, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. His mother, Mary Langdon, was from Virginia and had migrated to the South Carolina backcountry with her father, a farmer and doctor. Their neighbors included Andrew Pickens and the Calhoun family.

Cheves was born in Bulltown Fort amidst an ongoing war between the Scots-Irish settlers and the Cherokee, which settlers attributed to British instigation at the onset of the American Revolution. Cheves&#x27;s pregnant mother was sheltered at the fort for her protection. Shortly after his birth, his maternal aunt left the fort for supplies and was killed and scalped by enemy forces.

His mother died on November 20, 1779. Cheves later described standing at his mother&#x27;s grave as his earliest childhood memory. He was shortly thereafter placed in the care of his paternal aunt and uncle, Thomas and Margaret (née Agnew) Cheves. Cheves&#x27;s father Alexander enlisted in the Loyalist cause under Major John Hamilton, but his brother Thomas was a Patriot who fought under Andrew Pickens at the Battle of Kettle Creek. After the Loyalist cause became dire in 1782, Alexander Cheves transferred his property to Langdon, likely in fear of confiscation. He entered exile, first in Nova Scotia and then in London. He was not received favorably by British courts and was not remunerated for his service and decided to return to America.

Langdon was raised by his aunt and uncle on their family farm with four younger cousins. When they reached an appropriate age, the children began studies under Andrew Weed, a community leader and ruling elder in the local Presbyterian Church. The studies centered on the Westminster Catechism.

In 1785, Alexander Cheves returned from exile with his second wife, Susannah Craig, established a business in Charleston, and retrieved his son Langdon from his brother. Langdon continued his formal education from 1786 to 1788 with a Scottish schoolmaster who eliminated his backcountry drawl through corporal punishment. Around 1790, his father purchased a house slave named Phoebe.

==Early career==
===Business career===
At age 12, Langdon&#x27;s father withdrew him from school and apprenticed him to James Jaffray, a merchant, Glasgow native, and fellow member of the city&#x27;s St. Andrew&#x27;s Society. Langdon started by performing menial tasks at the Charleston shop before being promoted to supercargo to accompany shipments to and from Edisto Island. By 1792, at age 16, he had been promoted to chief clerk. In this role, he met and impressed many of the city&#x27;s key merchants, including John Potter, from whom Cheves personally secured a loan for the business and who later, as a director of the Bank of the United States, secured Cheves&#x27;s election as its president.

===Legal career===
In spite of the advice of his friends, who thought him &quot;born to be a merchant,&quot; Cheves began studying law at age 18. His early education was largely self-taught from a personal library, but he hired a personal tutor for French and Latin. After the death of his employer James Jaffray on October 15, 1795, Cheves met William Marshall, an attorney assigned to Jaffray&#x27;s estate and future judge of the South Carolina Court of Equity. Cheves applied to read law in Marshall&#x27;s office, and his apprenticeship began in early 1796. Although South Carolina law required four years of reading for non-college graduates, Cheves appeared for examination before the bar on October 13, 1797, and passed.

He opened an office in Charleston which he rented from Elihu H. Bay and shared with Robert James Turnbull. To improve his public speaking, Cheves joined a Philomathean Debating Society, which doubled as a social club. There, he met William Lowndes.

By May 1800, Cheves&#x27;s practice and social standing had grown. He had purchased a slave to serve as a personal servant, improved his dress, and applied to practice before the United States Court for District of South Carolina. In 1801, he accepted a partnership with Joseph Peace, a Quaker and native to the West Indies. The partnership was a financial success; each man made over $10,000 annually, and in its final two years from 1807 to 1809, each made $20,000 (approximately $ in ).

When he became Attorney General of the state of South Carolina in 1808, the firm&#x27;s work and prestige expanded dramatically. Among Cheves&#x27;s young private clerks during these two years were John M. Felder, John Laurens North, Thomas Smith Grimké, and future U.S. Senator Robert Young Hayne. Cheves would later bestow his legal practice on Hayne.

In the summer of 1807, Peace announced his plans to leave Charleston for Philadelphia, and Cheves, who believed Peace had not fulfilled his share of the partnership, eagerly arranged the firm&#x27;s dissolution. He planned to retire from law, but first accepted a one-year partnership with Amos B. Northrup.

==State politics==
In summer 1798, stemming from outrage over French mistreatment of American ambassador and Charleston native Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Cheves joined and became a treasurer of the Charleston Federalist Company, an informal social-military group formed to defend the harbor in the event of an ostensible French invasion.

On March 9, 1802, Cheves was elected to the Charleston City Council to succeed William Lee.

===South Carolina House of Representatives===
In October 1802, he was elected to represent the city (as the Parish of St. Philip and St. Michael) in the South Carolina House of Representatives. By this time, the Federalist Party was in rapid decline in the state, even its previous stronghold of Charleston. Cheves was identified with the younger Republican faction. He was not actively involved in the business of the House, focusing instead on his legal practice and declining to run for re-election in 1804.

Cheves returned to politics in 1806, running for the House again at the head of the Republican ticket. He received more votes than any other candidate. Upon the start of the new term, Cheves was appointed chair of the Judiciary Committee and the Committee on Privileges and Elections.

In a special legislative session, Cheves took an active part in the reapportionment of the state to address the disproportionate representation of Lowcountry whites. The resultant constitutional amendment, known as the &quot;Compromise of 1808,&quot; was guided by William Lowndes and resulted in permanent control by the combined planter aristocracy.

===1808 presidential election===
In the wake of the Chesapeake–Leopard affair, Cheves served with Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Thomas Pinckney, and William Washington on a non-partisan committee enforcing Charleston resolutions requiring ten days&#x27; mourning and barring assistance to British ships. Cheves also anonymously (as &quot;Aristides&quot;) wrote editorials in support of President Thomas Jefferson and the Embargo of 1807.

He endorsed James Madison over Charles Pinckney, urged the election of pro-Madison Representatives, and stood for re-election as one such Representative. He was elected by the legislature to head the electoral ticket and cast his vote for Madison.

===South Carolina Attorney General===
On December 7, 1808, Cheves was elected South Carolina Attorney General. In this role, he advised Governor John Drayton on legal matters, personally represented the state in the eastern circuit courts, and expanded his private practice.

==U.S. House of Representatives ==
===Elections===
====1810====
As the embargo on European goods dragged on, the South Carolina economy suffered. Rice prices were halved and cotton collapsed. By 1810, Charlestonians and South Carolinians at large were deeply discontent with the 11th Congress and President Madison. With the Federalist Party now a non-factor, the election was contested between competing Republican factions.

Alongside E.S. Thomas of the &quot;City Gazette&quot;, friends of Thomas Jefferson including Charles Pinckney supported William Loughton Smith, a former Federalist Congressman who had served as John Adams&#x27;s minister to Portugal. However, a much larger portion of the party in Charleston favored Cheves, and the Smith supporters eventually got in line. The election was held October 10–11, but was overshadowed by a fire in the city that destroyed 194 houses. Cheves was elected without opposition. The other new members of the delegation were William Lowndes, representing Columbia and John C. Calhoun of the Upstate.

Shortly after his election to the House, incumbent Robert Marion resigned early, triggering a special election to complete his term. Cheves won unopposed and took his seat early in the 11th Congress.

====1812====
In 1812, Cheves was re-elected to the 13th Congress. His opponent was the leader of the South Carolina Federalists, John Rutledge Jr. Cheves was attacked for his support of the War, especially in light of his 1808 letters which vigorously opposed &quot;war for commerce.&quot; Federalists also accused Cheves of private discrimination against immigrants. He remained personally aloof from the campaign, only writing to assure his constituents that he acknowledged their confidence and valued it &quot;more highly than money.&quot; He won re-election comfortably, 1,581–839.

===Committee assignments===
During his brief first term in office, during the 11th Congress, Cheves served on two minor select committees: one dealing with bank incorporations and the other on the completion of the 1810 Census.

In his second term, Cheves served on the Committee on Ways and Means and chaired of the Select Committee on Naval Affairs. He became acting chair of Ways and Means on April 27, 1812.

===War of 1812===
Immediately upon his arrival in Washington, Cheves was faced with the brewing international crisis that eventually resulted in the War of 1812. British impressment of Americans had become less frequent, but both Britain and France maintained obstacles to American trade with the other. The House had recently passed Macon&#x27;s Bill Number 2 in retaliation, and Napoleon had relaxed the French restrictions. In a debate over repealing Macon&#x27;s Bill, Cheves delivered a careful maiden speech critical of the bill as feeble and calling for a &quot;more direct and proper course.&quot; He was immediately identified as a &quot;War Hawk&quot;.

====War Mess====

In the 12th Congress, to which Cheves had originally been elected, his housemates included Lowndes, Calhoun, fellow Hawk Henry Clay, Clay&#x27;s rival Felix Grundy, and Senator George M. Bibb. The building came to be called the &quot;War Mess&quot; and served as a meeting place for pro-War leaders of Congress and Secretary of State James Monroe, who acted as liaison to the President. As a consequence, the residents of the house were among the best informed Representatives in the 12th Congress.

At the opening of the Congress in a special session on November 4, 1811, Clay was overwhelmingly elected Speaker of the House. He proceeded to appoint War Mess men to key committee posts. Calhoun and Grundy were appointed on the Foreign Relations Committee, Lowndes on Commerce and Manufactures, and Cheves was given the chairmanship of the Select Committee on Naval Affairs. He was made second man on the powerful Committee on Ways and Means.

In March 1812, the War Mess privately pressed Madison, through Monroe, to request an embargo of British trade, followed by formal declaration of war from Congress. Madison eventually agreed, and the United States formally declared war against Great Britain on June 18. Cheves later remembered that the War Mess were &quot;like school boys, [they] sprang up, and in the excess of their joy danced... a reel.&quot;

====Naval Affairs====
As chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, Cheves had a key role in preparedness and appropriations for the potential war ahead. He began by submitting detailed requests to Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton and Secretary of War William Eustis. By December, he had catalogued the nation&#x27;s limited naval strength and begun to plan, with Hamilton&#x27;s and Eustis&#x27;s advice, appropriations for additional ships and fortifications.

On December 17, 1811, he submitted two reports on naval affairs. The first recommended $1,000,000 (approximately in ) &quot;for the defense of our maritime frontier&quot; by refortifying existing defenses. The second authorized the purchase of ship timber, repair of all vessels not in use, the establishment of a national repair dock, and the construction of ten additional frigates, &quot;averaging thirty-eight guns.&quot;

Cheves delivered a speech on behalf of the committee on January 17, 1812, defending a reinvigorated Navy as the only effective protection for American &quot;commerce and our neutral rights on the ocean.&quot; The bill was opposed by orthodox Jeffersonians like David R. Williams, who had long opposed the existence of any Navy whatsoever. The sections providing for the construction of new ships and a new dockyard were struck down, but the timber purchase and repair provisions passed on January 29. The maritime fortifications bill passed overwhelmingly, 88–25, on February 4. Cheves&#x27;s forceful advocacy for the Navy led former Federalist Samuel Taggart to remark, 
&quot;whatever [Cheves] may be nominally he is in reality as high a toned Federalist as ever was Alexander Hamilton.&quot;

====Ways and Means====
As the second ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, Cheves also had a key role in securing the appropriations to fund the War. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin estimated the war would require about $21,000,000 in new revenues, with about half in debt and half raised in new taxes.

After a new embargo went into effect on April 1, 1812, the House declined to recess. Ways and Means chair Ezekiel Bacon, took a leave of absence on April 27, making Cheves the acting chairman of the powerful committee as the war began.

One of Cheves&#x27;s primary goals on Ways and Means was to persuade those who feared higher internal taxes or the restraining commercial effect on tariffs to join the war effort. To lighten the tax burden, Cheves attempted to repeal the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 in order to use the duties assessed on imports to lower internal taxes. Cheves introduced the repeal bill on June 19, the day after war was declared; repeal was defeated on June 25, with Speaker Clay casting the deciding vote in opposition.

====Break with Clay====
In November 1812, following the July recess and his re-election to a second term, Cheves returned to the House to secure funding for the war. The ensuing debate divided the War Mess between the South Carolinians, who favored free trade and internal taxes, and the Speaker Clay, Felix Grundy and other Republicans. The primary issue was the seizure of merchants&#x27; bonds: bonds purchased by American merchants who imported British goods during a gap in the embargo.

They purchased these bonds against their goods, which were then sold at an extremely high profit due to wartime inflation. Cheves, along with Calhoun and Lowndes, opposed efforts to allow the Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, to seize the bonds. Cheves was outvoted in committee but refused to defend the proposal in front of the House, deferring to Richard Mentor Johnson to advocate in his place.

In response to Johnson&#x27;s advocacy, Cheves attacked the measure as an impermissible delegation of Congress&#x27;s legislative authority. He extended his criticism to Clay&#x27;s general program of restrictive economics, arguing that it devastated the American coastal economy in striking at the British. When Clay attempted to introduce a measure to preserve the protective system but exempt the bonds at issue, Cheves, Calhoun, and Lowndes maintained their opposition. Ultimately, the Ways and Means report was defeated in the House on December 11 by a vote of 49–52; the South Carolinians won, but at the expense of unity within the War faction. After Cheves was unable to push through any internal tax increase by the end of the term in March, the House approved a $5,000,000 issue of Treasury notes and a $16,000,000 loan at Secretary Gallatin&#x27;s request.

Cheves&#x27;s declaration against Clay&#x27;s protective system caused issues at home as well as in Washington. Governor of South Carolina Joseph Alston called Cheves a &quot;political Jesuit&quot; and declared his seat (as well as those of the other South Carolina representatives) vacant for the next term on the technicality that Cheves had not notified the governor of his acceptance. Charlestonians denounced Alston until he bowed to pressure and delivered the commissions.

===13th Congress===
Upon his arrival in Washington for the 13th Congress in March 1813, Cheves learned that Clay had stripped him of all committee assignments.

As a result, he had little involvement in the debates over national policy and focused his efforts on securing Charleston against the threat of a British invasion. In June, Cheves personally lobbied Secretary of War John Armstrong Jr. to allow Thomas Pinckney, in command of the Southern Department of the War, to disperse his troops along the coast. He voted against President Madison&#x27;s proposed embargo, which passed regardless and further alienated New England Federalists.

==Speaker of the House==
On January 14, 1814, President Madison nominated a commission to negotiate peace with Britain, including Albert Gallatin, John Quincy Adams, and Speaker Henry Clay. With Clay out of the country, he was forced to resign his office, triggering an election to succeed him on January 19. The Federalists threw their support to Cheves, who won a slight majority over Felix Grundy, who had the support of the majority of the Republican caucus, and former Speaker Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina. Clay urged the Republicans to unite behind Cheves.

As Speaker, Cheves was a strict parliamentarian. He demanded members confine their remarks to the motion pending and did not tolerate personal attacks, as had been frequent under Clay. He made only one speech, lamenting losses in the war but urging the government to continue to prosecute it vigorously. By April, with Napoleon on the verge of apparent defeat and Britain threatening total domination over maritime commerce, Cheves successfully saw repeal of Clay&#x27;s restrictive system. He soon thereafter returned to Charleston and informed party leaders that he would not be a candidate for re-election to a third term.
In September, Congress returned urgently to Washington for a special session. On August 24, with Washington evacuated, the British had burned the capital. The night after, a tornado destroyed much of what remained. The House relocated to a small room in the General Post and Patent Office Building, itself a former hotel.

===Defeating the Second National Bank===
In addition to the physical destruction the capital, Congress faced a budget crisis; $74,000,000 was necessary to keep the government solvent. Treasury Secretary George W. Campbell resigned rather than offer a solution, and banks throughout the country had begun to suspend cash payments. Cheves himself declined President Madison&#x27;s offer to serve as Campbell&#x27;s successor; instead, Madison appointed Alexander J. Dallas.

To persuade banks to subscribe to government loans, Dallas suggested the imposition of new taxes and the revival of the national bank. Republicans defeated efforts to recharter the First National Bank in 1811, but were willing to contemplate a new charter given the present crisis. Dallas presented a plan recommending $50,000,000 in bank capital, $6,000,000 in specie and the remainder in government bonds. The government would subscribe $20,000,000. John C. Calhoun, with Cheves&#x27;s backing, counter-proposed a bank to serve the financial community that would bar investors from buying stock using Treasury notes issued during the war.

On January 2, the Dallas plan came before the House. Cheves cast the deciding vote against the bill. He argued instead for an independent bank, as the Calhoun plan provided. The bill failed 80–81, but was passed on reconsideration on January 7; Madison vetoed the bill.

===Other acts===
In September, Cheves cast the tie-breaking vote in the House to relocate the capital from Washington, but the House reversed itself a week later with no alternate location selected.

When Vice President Elbridge Gerry died on November 23, 1814, the office of President pro tempore of the Senate was vacant, and so Cheves briefly became next in line for the presidency. This status lasted for two days until Senator John Gaillard was chosen president pro tempore.

After his term expired, he devoted himself exclusively to his law practice in Charleston bar. In 1815, he was made a judge of the superior court of South Carolina.

Cheves was appointed chief commissioner of claims under the Treaty of Ghent.

==President of the Bank of the United States==
===Background===
Shortly after Cheves left office in March 1815, President Madison successfully lobbied the new 14th Congress to re-charter the National Bank, headquartered in Philadelphia and governed along much the same lines as its 1791 predecessor. Madison and Secretary Dallas successfully installed William Jones as its first President.

Under Jones&#x27;s leadership, the Bank was soon overextended through branch loans and the decision to accept promissory notes, often backed in its own stock, from subscribers in lieu of specie. Nevertheless, the Bank initially flourished in the booming post-war economy.

Jones&#x27;s tenure came to an end in January 1819. At that time, the country was experiencing a financial panic, the Panic of 1819, which left the Bank on the brink of collapse. Cheves himself later referred to the Bank during this period as &quot;a ship without a rudder or sails, on short allowance of provisions and water, on a stormy sea and far from land.&quot; It paused operations on July 20, 1818, and demanded payment of specie from state banks, bankrupting many and leading to a wave of resentment.

===Election===
In December 1818, Charleston stockholders in the Second Bank asked Cheves for his permission to propose his name for the Bank presidency at the upcoming board meeting, and he consented. Cheves was himself a founding but inactive member of the board of the Charleston branch, who later described himself as &quot;ignorant and unapprehensive of the situation of the bank.&quot;

His Charleston supporters enlisted the powerful support of Stephen Girard of Philadelphia and Alexander Brown of Baltimore. They elected Cheves to the board of the directors on January 5, 1819, but with no desire for a divisive leadership fight, failed to unseat Jones as president. Cheves accepted his seat with hopes that he would be elevated in 1820 when Jones, then ill, retired. Instead, Jones and the board were indicted by a House select committee chaired by John Canfield Spencer for violations of the Bank charter, poor management, and speculation. Jones resigned in disgrace on January 21. Cheves was his natural successor; he briefly considered, but declined, the chance to succeed William Johnson on the U.S. Supreme Court and accepted the presidency on February 15 and was sworn in on March 6.

===Tenure===
The day after Cheves took office, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court John Marshall delivered his opinion in the case &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot;, upholding the Bank&#x27;s exemption from state taxation, harboring the Bank against its political opponents at the state level.

Shortly after he entered office, Cheves also presided over the establishment of a new bank building at Chestnut Street in Philadelphia. The building was completed in 1821.

====Monetary policies====
Cheves&#x27;s early tenure focused on rectifying the failed promises of Jones&#x27;s administration, enforcing monetary contractions at the branch level by ordering branches in the South and West to stop issuing notes and eastern branches to stop receiving them. He also reduced salaries and opened a correspondence with Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford. On April 9, he called a meeting of the board of directors to outline his six proposals, which the board approved overwhelmingly:
* that the curtailment of loans begun by Jones be continued;
* that southern and western offices be forbidden to issue notes whenever such notes would drain the eastern offices of specie;
* that state banks be required to begin immediate specie payments for debts to the Bank;
* that the Treasury give the Bank advance notice when it proposed to withdraw funds from a branch where no government deposits had been made; 
* that debentures be paid in the same currency for which they were originally issued; and
* that additional specie be purchased from abroad to secure the Bank&#x27;s obligations.

Crawford voiced his displeasure at the requirement of Treasury notice. Cheves himself acknowledged that the curtailment of loans was only a temporary measure adopted at the insistence of Bank officers; he determined to lift the restriction as soon as possible. To Crawford, he wrote that the cause of the reforms was &quot;the restraint put upon the offices, with which exchanges were adverse, in the issue of their notes.&quot; Circulation dropped about 25 percent. Though his policies likely ensured the Bank&#x27;s institutional stability, hard money advocate William M. Gouge blamed his restrictions for the continued depression: &quot;The Bank was saved and the people were ruined.&quot;

Within Cheves&#x27;s first six months as president, a movement was instigated to remove him and return to Jones&#x27;s policy, but it fizzled and he was re-elected unanimously in 1820.

In 1820, drawing on the works of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus, and J.B. Say, Cheves anonymously defended his policies (under the pen name &quot;Say&quot;) an essay titled &quot;Inquiry into the Causes of Public Prosperity and Distress&quot;. He argued that war-time prosperity had ended because of the failure of the foreign export market, the &quot;diminution and depreciation of our currency,&quot; the &quot;failure of manufacturing establishments,&quot; and the resulting &quot;diminished demand for labor and capital.&quot; Amid this depression, a &quot;pernicious system of banking&quot; had cheapened the currency and produced &quot;a kind of general paralysis,&quot; which his policies had reversed. In time, he predicted, agriculture would be restored, though manufacturing would only grow at the same pace as population in the cities and towns.

In January 1821, in an effort to placate the South and West, Cheves proposed a more lenient loan policy provided it was compatible with maintenance of a sound currency. He was opposed only by Nicholas Biddle. He also established a dividend in July 1821 of 1.5%, which increased to 2.5% by January 1822.

====Structural reforms====
Also in 1819, Cheves deputized director Nicholas Biddle to investigate James A. Buchanan, George Williams, and James W. McCulloch for illegally purchasing bank stock worth nearly $3,500,000 and accumulating large and unauthorized personal indebtedness against the Bank. Biddle&#x27;s investigation revealed fraudulent inflation in the price of the Bank&#x27;s stock and personal enrichment by all three men. McCulloch was removed as cashier and Buchanan resigned as president.

In 1820, subordinate officers in Richmond and Philadelphia were forced to resigned for misconduct and unreported deficiencies. Cheves called for investigations into the business policies of western branches and legal protections for the Bank by Congress amending the charter:
*the term of Bank directors to be extended to more than three years;
*legal protection for the Bank against frauds committed by its own officers;
*officials other than the President and cashier deputized to sign bank notes; and
*branches required by charter to accept only their own notes or those of the parent bank in Philadelphia.

These calls were unsuccessful; no Congressional majority could be gained to side with Cheves during his presidency.

===Resignation and succession===
As early as 1821, Cheves had resolved to retire from his post by January 1823. He made his decision known to Secretary Crawford in May 1822 and announced it at the stockholders meeting on October 1, after which a struggle to succeed him ensued. Cheves first fended off a challenge by Jones supporters who sought to reverse his policies; the board he nominated was elected unanimously.

Among the Cheves supporters, Secretary Crawford solicited Albert Gallatin, but received little approval from the directors. Roswell L. Colt lobbied for his nephew, Nicholas Biddle. Biddle was also a friend of President Monroe. Robert Gilmor Jr. advised Cheves that Biddle was &quot;unsuitable.&quot; Cheves adamantly preferred a Philadelphian, but disliked Biddle as pretentious for his opposition to his liberalization policies. Baltimore directors lobbied heavily for a resident of that city, but were split between Thomas Ellicott and John White, who had succeeded McCulloch as branch cashier, and were unable to overcome Cheves&#x27;s preference for a Philadelphian. Cheves ultimately settled William M. Meredith but, fearing Meredith was unqualified, asked White to accept the role of cashier to act as de facto President. White rejected this plan.

Meanwhile, Biddle began to actively campaign for the position. Emphasizing support from Crawford and Monroe, he openly expressed his willingness to serve. He gained support from John Quincy Adams, John C. Calhoun, Stephen Girard, and powerful Philadelphia stockholders. In November, Cheves publicly supported Biddle as his successor and he was voted in 14–1.

==Retirement==
After leaving the Bank, Cheves remained in Philadelphia until 1826, when he moved his family to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He returned his family to South Carolina in 1830 to become rice planters and continued to engage in public debate, writing occasional essays and reviews. He was a leading advocate for the idea of a unified Southern resistance to national government, particularly in opposition to tariffs and the abolition of slavery.

In 1823, he was appointed to adjust American claims under the St. Petersburg Convention. Most of the disputed claims concerned slaves seized by the British navy from southern plantations, and Cheves was chosen by Southern Congressmen as a sympathetic pro-slavery voice. After a series of delays and disagreements, the British agreed to pay a lump sum for the seized slaves, which would be distributed to American slaveowners by a commission consisting of Cheves, Henry Seawell, and James Pleasants. During their adjudication, Cheves argued against admitting the testimony of the slaves themselves, but Congress intervened against him to side with Seawall and Pleasants. He resigned the commission early after approving two claims.

In 1823–1824, Cheves was asked to re-enter the political arena as a Democratic-Republican Party candidate for the office of U.S. President in time for the 1824 election; he turned this offer down. In 1828, he endorsed Andrew Jackson over his friend Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams. Jackson considered Cheves for Secretary of the Treasury, but he was passed over in favor of Samuel Ingham.

===Nullification and secession===
During the nullification crisis of 1828–33, Cheves urged tariff reduction, as did most members of the South Carolina planter class. In contrast to many of his allies, however, Cheves spoke highly of regional union in opposition to &quot;the metaphysics of nullification&quot; as a distinctly South Carolinian issue. He framed the issue as &quot;a great Southern question, in which South Carolina is not more interested than the rest of the Southern States&quot; and therefore urged the formation of a convention of States to present a unified front of resistance and pressure Congress into tariff reduction. He also recalled the failure of Georgia in resistance to the Supreme Court decision &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot;. His compromise position was not popular with either the outright Nullifier or Unionist factions. Cheves decried both factions as divisive and the popular rancor over the issue a betrayal of representative constitutional democracy.

Cheves stayed aloof from the intrastate conflict over the crisis until 1832, when he joined the Unionists after they adopted his call for a convention of Southern states and were successful in reducing the tariff, over the Nullifiers&#x27; objections. Cheves directly countered Calhoun, now Vice President of the United States, arguing that &quot;[t]here is not a shadow of support for the doctrine of Constitutional Nullification... in the Constitution of the United States.&quot; He did nonetheless decline to directly join the Unionist campaign and refused election as a delegate from Sumter County to the Unionist state convention.

In 1837, he opposed a recharter of the National Bank, arguing that excessive centralization threatened to snap the taut binds between the States:

&quot;Those who wish the Union to last, should not desire to make the Government stronger. The cord is one which will not bear stretching; you may multiply its strands but you will destroy the material. Touch it with power and it will snap like a thread.&quot;

In 1844, amid renewed calls for nullification over the Tariff of 1842, Cheves emphatically revived his prior position, calling for no action by South Carolina without the backing of the entire South. This time, he added that such action was also necessary to defend slavery, without which the South would become &quot;blackened ruins, with a remanent of the African race wandering amidst them in all the mistery of desolation and hopelessness.&quot; Throughout the following decade, Cheves&#x27;s idea of unified Southern action became increasingly popular, leading to a series of informal commercial and political conventions throughout the region.

In the summer and autumn of 1850, Cheves served as a delegate to the Nashville Convention, which adopted resolutions denouncing the Compromise of 1850. In the convention&#x27;s second, more radical session, Cheves took a leading role by personally offering and advocating for a resolution that &quot;secession by the joint action of the slave-holding States is the only efficient remedy for the aggravated wrongs which they now endure and the enormous evils which threaten them in future, from the usurped and unrestrained power of the federal government.&quot;

At the state convention of 1852, Cheves worked to prevent South Carolina from seceding unilaterally, maintaining his belief in Southern unity.

===Planting and real estate===
Cheves&#x27;s plantation, called Delta, made heavy use of slave labor; when his daughter was married in late 1830, Cheves gifted her forty-one slaves and three house servants. The total number of slaves held on the plantation throughout his management varied around 200. Cheves frequently replaced his plantation&#x27;s overseers through his eleven years as its manager, finding that they were inadequate &quot;manager[s] of Negroes.&quot; He employed lashings but refused to employ methods of punishment that he believed would &quot;extend so far as to endanger life and health.&quot; In 1835, he inherited a second plantation focused on cotton production, which he named Lang Syne, and an additional 94 slaves. A third plantation, Southfield, was established for his youngest son Hayne in 1845.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Cheves met his wife, Mary Elizabeth Dulles, on a return trip from Montréal. She was a young Charleston resident at boarding school in Philadelphia, rooming with Cheves&#x27;s law partner&#x27;s sister-in-law. Cheves&#x27;s party agreed to escort the two girls home to Charleston. They were engaged to be married by December 1805.

They were married on May 6, 1806, at the Dulles home in Charleston. The couple had fourteen children including proslavery essayist Louisa McCord. Their eldest son, Joseph, attended Yale before transferring to Harvard, where he was a member of the Porcellian Club. Joseph graduated in 1826 and read law in New York City. Alexander Cheves attended the United States Military Academy at West Point before studying and practicing law in Baltimore. He later succumbed to alcoholism and became estranged from his father.

Mary died on April 5, 1836, at the age of forty-six.

===Religion===
Cheves was a lifelong Presbyterian.

===Civic organizations===
In 1814, he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. In 1821, Cheves was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society and Mercantile Library Association in Philadelphia.

===Views on evolution===
Like many wealthy men of his day, Cheves was interested in science. The physician and geologist Joseph Le Conte was an acquaintance. In his autobiography, Le Conte wrote that Cheves had articulated to him a theory of evolution almost identical to Charles Darwin&#x27;s, long before Darwin published his &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. However, Cheves never published his ideas on the subject.

==Death and burial==
After the death of his son-in-law David McCord and son Charles in 1855, Cheves suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed. He moved to Columbia, South Carolina with his daughter Louisa, and lived there until his death on June 26, 1857.

He was laid in state in Charleston City Hall and was buried at the Scots Presbyterian Church.

<text>Russell Claude Smith (born August 2, 1963 in Johannesburg, South Africa) is a Canadian writer and newspaper columnist. Smith&#x27;s novels and short stories are mostly set in Toronto, where he lives.

== Biography ==

Smith grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He attended the Halifax Grammar School and Queen Elizabeth High School, and studied French literature at Queen&#x27;s University, the University of Poitiers, and the University of Paris III. He has an MA in French from Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston, Ontario.

As a freelance reporter and cultural commentator, he has published in the &quot;New York Review of Books, Details, The Walrus,Toronto Life, Flare, Now, EnRoute&quot; and other journals. He won the William Allen White award for magazine writing in 1995.

From 1999 to 2020, Smith wrote a weekly column on the arts for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. On resigning from the column, Smith published an article in The Walrus reflecting on his departure as a mixture of quick-digest writing, lack of editorial support, and a cut-throat business model. The discontinuation of the column was lamented by &quot;The Walrus&quot; letters to the editor. 

Smith throughout bis career expressed a profound interest in Canadian English. He was the host of the CBC radio program on language, &quot;And Sometimes Y&quot;, for two seasons.

Smith taught the Fiction Workshop in the University of Guelph&#x27;s Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing programme from 2009 to 2017.

In 2019 he became an acquiring editor for Dundurn Press.

== Fiction ==

His early novels, &quot;How Insensitive&quot; (1994) and &quot;Noise&quot; (1998), are satirical and comic portrayals of big-city life and the sexual mores of young people. &quot;How Insensitive&quot; was nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award, at that time the most prestigious Canadian literary prize. &quot;Noise&quot; was published in German as &quot;Glamour&quot; by List Verlag. His book of short stories, &quot;Young Men&quot;, followed in 1999. The opening story in that collection, &quot;Party Going&quot;, won the Canadian National Magazine Award for fiction in 1997.

He then published an illustrated fantasy novella, &quot;The Princess and the Whiskheads&quot;, an allegory about the role of art in a metropolis. The illustrations were by Wesley Bates.

His pornographic novel, &quot;Diana: A Diary in the Second Person&quot; (2003), was published by Gutter Press under the pseudonym Diane Savage. The novel was republished, under his own name, with a new introduction, by Biblioasis in 2008.

&quot;Muriella Pent&quot; (2004) is a longer and more ambitious novel, concerning the arrival of a Caribbean writer of mixed race in the stodgy environment of official Canadian culture. It was shortlisted for the Rogers Writers&#x27; Trust Fiction Prize, and named as Best Fiction of 2004 by Amazon.ca.

His novel &quot;Girl Crazy&quot; was published by HarperCollins Canada in 2010.

His short story collection, &quot;Confidence&quot;, was published in 2015, and was longlisted for the 2015 Scotiabank Giller Prize. One of the stories in that collection, &quot;Raccoons&quot;, won the Canadian National Magazine Award for fiction in that year.

== Other works ==

In 2005 Thomas Dunne Books published Smith&#x27;s non-fiction book, &quot;Men&#x27;s Style: The Thinking Man&#x27;s Guide To Dress&quot;, which is based on his regular column on men&#x27;s fashion in the Canadian national newspaper, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. The book was illustrated by Edwin Fotheringham.

Smith&#x27;s memoir &quot;Blindsided: How Twenty Years of Writing About Booze, Drugs and Sex Ended in the Blink of an Eye&quot; is available as an e-book.

In 2018, Smith compiled and edited the anthology &quot;Best Canadian Stories 2018&quot; (Biblioasis). 

In 2020, Smith translated Quebec novelist Nadine Bismuth&#x27;s novel &quot;Un Lien Familial&quot;, as &quot;A Family Affair&quot; (Anansi).

<text>Diego Martínez Barrio (25 November 1883, in Seville – 1 January 1962) was a Spanish politician during the Second Spanish Republic, Prime Minister of Spain between 9 October 1933 and 26 December 1933 and was briefly appointed again by Manuel Azaña on 19 July 1936 - two days after the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. From 16 March 1936 to 30 March 1939 Martínez was President of the Cortes. In 1936, he was briefly the interim President of the Second Spanish Republic, from 7 April to 10 May.

==Biography==
Barrio was born in Seville. A member of the Radical Republican Party, he was the Minister in the Alejandro Lerroux government but later he left the party for dissatisfaction with the politics of Lerroux.

Martínez consequently founded and led the Republican Union and participated in the Spanish Popular Front, being elected to government in 1936. He led the integration of the Republican Union into the Popular Front, being elected the speaker of the Cortes (Spanish Parliament). In February 1939, he rejected to replace Manuel Azaña as president of the Republic. Following the resignation of Santiago Casares Quiroga two days after the outbreak of the civil war, he was appointed prime minister on 19 July 1936. As part of his intention to avert war, his cabinet ignored the left wing of the Popular Front, but he would last just a few hours, and he resigned later the same morning, after an unsuccessful appeal to Nationalist General Emilio Mola to avoid war, and was succeeded by José Giral.
He fled the country after Francisco Franco came to power in 1939.

He was the Grand Master of the Grande Oriente Español from 1929 to 1934.

After the fall of the Republic, he went into exile, first to France and then to Mexico, where, in 1945, he was designated president of the Republic in exile until 1962. Martínez finally returned to Paris, where he died.

In 2000, his remains were moved to Seville.

<text>The British Motor Corporation Limited (BMC) was a UK-based vehicle manufacturer formed in early 1952 to give effect to an agreed merger of the Morris and Austin businesses.

BMC acquired the shares in Morris Motors and the Austin Motor Company. Morris Motors, the holding company of the productive businesses of the Nuffield Organization, owned MG, Riley, and Wolseley.

The agreed exchange of shares in Morris or Austin for shares in the new holding company, BMC, became effective in mid-April 1952.

In September 1965, BMC took control of its major supplier of bodies, Pressed Steel, acquiring Jaguar&#x27;s body supplier in the process. In September 1966, BMC merged with Jaguar Cars. In December 1966, BMC changed its name to British Motor Holdings Limited (BMH).

BMH merged, in May 1968, with Leyland Motor Corporation Limited, which made trucks and buses and owned both Standard-Triumph International Limited and the Rover Company to become British Leyland.

==Organisation==

BMC was the largest British car company of its day, with (in 1952) 39% of British output, producing a wide range of cars under brand names including Austin, Morris, MG, Austin-Healey, Riley, and Wolseley, as well as commercial vehicles and agricultural tractors. The first chairman was Lord Nuffield (William Morris), but he was replaced at the end of 1952 by Austin&#x27;s Leonard Lord, who continued in that role until his 65th birthday in 1961, but handing over, in theory at least, the managing director responsibilities to his deputy George Harriman in 1956.

BMC&#x27;s headquarters were at the Austin Longbridge plant, near Birmingham and Austin was the dominant partner in the group mainly because of the chairman. The use of Morris engine designs was dropped within three years and all new car designs were coded ADO from &quot;Amalgamated Drawing Office&quot;. The Longbridge plant was up to date, having been thoroughly modernised in 1951, and compared very favourably to Nuffield&#x27;s 16 different and often old-fashioned factories scattered over the Midlands. Austin&#x27;s management systems, however, especially cost control and marketing, were not as good as Nuffield&#x27;s and as the market changed from a shortage of cars to competition, this was to tell. The biggest-selling car, the Mini, was famously analysed by Ford Motor Company, which concluded that BMC must have been losing £30 on every one sold. The result was that although volumes held up well throughout the BMC era, market share fell as did profitability and hence investment in new models, triggering the 1966 merger with Jaguar Cars to form British Motor Holdings (BMH), and the government-sponsored merger of BMH with Leyland Motor Corporation in 1968.

At the time of the mergers, a well established dealership network was in place for each of the marques. Among the car-buying British public was a tendency of loyalty to a particular marque and marques appealed to different market segments. This meant that marques competed against each other in some areas, though some marques had a larger range than others. The Riley and Wolseley models were selling in very small numbers. Styling was also getting distinctly old-fashioned and this caused Leonard Lord, in an unusual move for him, to call upon the services of an external stylist.

As well as the car manufacturing arms, the company had its own printing and publishing firm, the Nuffield Press, inherited from the Morris Motors group.

==BMC Farina==
In 1958, BMC hired Battista Farina to redesign its entire car line. This resulted in the creation of three &quot;Farina&quot; saloons, each of which was badge-engineered to fit the various BMC car lines.

The compact Farina model debuted in 1958 with the Austin A40 Farina. This is considered by many to be the first mass-produced hatchback car: a small estate version was produced with a horizontally split tailgate, its size and configuration would today be considered that of a small hatchback. A Mark II A40 Farina appeared in 1961 and was produced through 1967. These small cars used the A-Series engine.

The mid-sized Farinas were launched in 1958 with the Wolseley 15/60. Other members of the group included the Riley 4/68, Austin A55 Cambridge Mk. II, MG Magnette Mk. III, and Morris Oxford V. Later, the design was licensed in Argentina and produced as the Siam Di Tella 1500, Traveller station wagon and Argenta pick-up. The mid-size cars used the B-Series straight-4 engine. Most of these cars lasted until 1961, though the Di Tellas remained until 1966. They were replaced with a new Farina body style and most were renamed. These were the Austin A60 Cambridge, MG Magnette Mk. IV, Morris Oxford VI, Riley 4/72, and Wolseley 16/60, and in 1964 the Siam Magnette 1622 alongside the Siam Di Tella in Argentina. Most remained in production until 1968, with no rear-wheel drive replacement produced.

The third and largest Farina car was the Austin A99 Westminster/Vanden Plas Princess 3-Litre/Wolseley 6/99, launched in 1959. They used the large C-Series straight-6 engine. The large Farinas were updated in 1961 as the Austin A110 Westminster, Vanden Plas Princess 3-Litre Mk. II, and Wolseley 6/110. These remained in production until 1968.

===BMC project numbers===


Most BMC projects followed the earlier Austin practice of describing vehicles with an &#x27;ADO&#x27; number (which stood for &#x27;Austin Design Office&#x27; but after the merger &#x27;Amalgamated Drawing Office&#x27;). Hence, cars that had more than one marque name (e.g. Morris Mini Minor and Austin Mini) would have the same ADO number. Given the often complex badge-engineering that BMC undertook, it is common amongst enthusiasts to use the ADO number when referring to vehicles which were a single design (for example, saying &#x27;The ADO15 entered production in 1959&#x27;- this encompasses the fact that when launched, the ADO15 was marketed as the Morris Mini Minor and, later, the Austin Seven—soon replaced with Austin Mini). The ADO numbering system did continue for some time after the creation of British Leyland – notable models being the Austin Allegro (ADO67) and the prototype version of the Austin Metro (ADO88).

==BMC agricultural vehicles==
With the merger of the Nuffield and Austin interests, the Nuffield Organization&#x27;s tractor range, the Nuffield Universal, was incorporated into BMC.

==BMC abroad==
In the 1950s and the 1960s, BMC set up 21 plants overseas, some as subsidiaries, and some as joint ventures, to assemble its vehicles. One was British Motor Corporation (Australia) which was established in 1953 at the Nuffield Australia site on the one-time Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney. This facility went from a marshalling area for fully imported Morris cars (Austins were up until then being assembled in Melbourne from an earlier Austin Motors establishment), to a facility for making CKD cars, to the total local fabrication and construction of vehicles, engines, and mechanicals.

Denmark was a particularly strong market for BMC products in Europe. In the postwar period, the Danish government closely regulated exports and imports to maintain the country&#x27;s balance of trade. High-value imports such as cars were heavily taxed. 

From 1963 to 1975, a company was established in Spain to produce BMC cars under licence, its name was: &#x27;AUTHI&#x27; -&#x27;Automoviles de Turismo Hispano-Ingleses&#x27; -&#x27;Spanish-English Tourism Automobiles&#x27;. The factory was in Pamplona, Navarra, Spain, and when the production of Austin and Mini cars was discontinued, Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo (SEAT), owned by the state and some banks and industrial investors, purchased the factory. After the takeover of SEAT by Volkswagen, SEAT made an &#x27;internal&#x27; resale of the Pamplona factory, formerly Authi, to Volkswagen, which soon started producing there the &#x27;Polo&#x27;.

In 1964, BMC Turkey was established in cooperation with the British Motor Corporation. The Turkish partners retained the 74% of the capital while 26% held by the UK-based British Motor Corporation.

==Government takes over==
The Wilson Labour government (1964–1970) came to power at a time when British manufacturing industry was in decline and decided that the remedy was to promote more mergers, particularly in the motor industry. Chrysler was already buying into the Rootes Group, and Leyland Motors had acquired Standard Triumph in 1961 (and would buy Rover in 1967), becoming a major automotive force. BMC was suffering a dramatic drop in its share of the home market. Tony Benn, appointed Minister of Technology in July 1966, brought pressure to bear on the industry.

===British Motor Holdings Limited===
In mid-1965 BMC offered to buy its major supplier Pressed Steel and took control in September with 27,000 employees. Twelve months later, BMC merged with Jaguar Cars adding a further 7,000 employees. On 14 December 1966 BMC shareholders approved the change of its name to British Motor Holdings (BMH) and it took effect from that date.

===British Leyland===

Little more than 12 months later in January 1968, under pressure from the Labour British government and Minister of Technology Tony Benn, a further wave of mergers occurred in the British car industry. BMH merged with the Leyland Motor Corporation (LMC) to form the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC). BMC Ltd (which contained most of the operations of the former British Motor Corporation) remained a subsidiary company of BLMC after the merger, although its name was later changed to &quot;Austin-Morris Ltd&quot; - reflecting the new &quot;Austin-Morris&quot; division of BLMC, with the BMC name subsequently disappearing from public view.

Within the new conglomerate, the various marques were grouped together into two main divisions, based largely on the original BMC and LMC businesses; with the former mass market BMC marques becoming part of the &quot;Austin-Morris&quot; division of BLMC, whilst LMC stablemates Rover and Triumph joined Jaguar in the Specialist Division.

This basic structure remained in place right up until the creation of the Austin Rover Group in the early 1980s, by which time BLMC had been nationalised and renamed British Leyland Limited (later just BL plc), although by this time both Jaguar and Land Rover had been placed in their own independent subsidiaries which were separate from the old BMC/LMC divisions.

==Post mortem==
Following the merger with Leyland, a review of company records undertaken with the support of the new board, author Graham Turner stated that at the time of the merger, 16 versions of the Mini were being produced, yielding an average profit of just £16 per car, while every Morris Minor sold lost the group £9 and every Austin Westminster sold lost £17. This helps to explain why the Westminster and Minor were among the early casualties of the merger, as well as the introduction of the Mini Clubman, capable of being built for less, but sold for more than a standard Mini thanks to simplified (&quot;modernised&quot;) front panels.

Even the UK&#x27;s best seller, the Austin/Morris 1100, had to be subjected to an emergency cost-reduction programme which removed about £10 from the cost of each car, applying changes that included the omission of lead sealing from body joints (£2.40 per car), removing provision for optional reversing lamps (£0.10) and &quot;changes in body finish&quot; (£0.75).

Rebuilding the Cowley plant to include &quot;new automated body building facilities&quot; saved £2.00 in transport costs per car for bodies that no longer needed to be transported from the corporation&#x27;s Swindon plant and in the longer term further transport costs were saved by concentrating assembly of the model at a single plant, rather than splitting it between plants at Cowley and Longbridge.

Because of the high proportion of auto-production costs represented by fixed costs that needed to be allocated over a planned production volume, and the use in the 1960s of investment appraisal criteria that were ill-suited to accounting for volume fluctuations and the rapidly changing value of the UK currency in the 1960s, the precise figures quoted may be open to challenge, but the new management&#x27;s diagnosis that BMC&#x27;s profitability was insufficient to fund support and new model investment to cover its disparate range of brands and models was hard to refute.

Throughout the 1960s, the failure of the United Kingdom to join the European Economic Community meant that the company could not exploit the lucrative European markets due to high import tariffs, whereas BMC&#x27;s key rivals Ford and General Motors both had German subsidiaries producing and selling within the bloc, and were therefore immune from those import tariffs.

==Legacy==
In 2002, BMC (Turkey), a Turkish commercial vehicle builder, originally set up by the British Motor Corporation to build its designs under licence in the 1950s, began exporting its vehicles to Britain. This allowed the return of the BMC brand to British roads for the first time in over 40 years.

<doc id="294790" wikidata="Q2303454" url="?curid=294790" title="Republican Union (Spain, 1934)">
<text>The Republican Union () was a Spanish republican party founded in 1934 by Diego Martinez Barrio.

It was formed as a result of a merger of several small republican parties, most notably Diego Martinez Barrio&#x27;s Radical Democratic Party and the Radical Socialist Republican Party, both of which had split away from the more moderate Radical Republican Party of Alejandro Lerroux.

Integrated in the Popular Front ahead of the 1936 election, the party won 38 seats becoming the fourth largest party. It formed a governing coalition with Manuel Azaña&#x27;s Republican Left. Though it participated in all republican governments during the Spanish Civil War, it played a minor role starting under Largo Caballero&#x27;s government.
In exile in Mexico, it was the main support of the Republican government-in-exile until it was dissolved in 1959 to found the Spanish Democratic Republican Action along with the Republican Left.

<text>Steven William Moffat (; born 18 November 1961) is a Scottish television writer, television producer and screenwriter. He is best known for his work as the second showrunner and head writer of the 2005 revival of the BBC sci-fi television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2010–17), and for co-creating and co-writing the BBC crime drama television series &quot;Sherlock&quot; (2010–17). In the 2015 Birthday Honours, Moffat was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to drama.

Born in Paisley, Scotland, Moffat, the son of a teacher, was formerly a teacher himself. His first television work was the teen drama series &quot;Press Gang&quot;. His first sitcom, &quot;Joking Apart&quot;, was inspired by the breakdown of his first marriage. Later in the 1990s, he wrote &quot;Chalk&quot;, inspired by his own experience as an English teacher. Moffat, a lifelong fan of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, wrote the comedic sketch episode &quot;The Curse of Fatal Death&quot; for the Comic Relief charity telethon, which aired in early 1999. His early-2000s sitcom &quot;Coupling&quot; was based upon the development of his relationship with television producer Sue Vertue.

In March 2004, Moffat was announced as one of the writers for the revived &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV series. He wrote six episodes during Russell T Davies&#x27; first era as head writer, which aired from 2005 to 2008. Moffat&#x27;s scripts during this era won him three Hugo Awards, a BAFTA Craft Award, and a BAFTA Cymru Award. Between episodes, he wrote and produced the modern-day drama series &quot;Jekyll&quot;, based on the novella &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;. In May 2008, it was announced that Moffat would succeed Davies as showrunner, lead writer and executive producer of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Around the same time, he dropped his contract with film director Steven Spielberg for a film trilogy based on artist Hergé&#x27;s character Tintin. Part of the lone script he wrote was used in Spielberg&#x27;s film &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, eventually released in 2011.

Moffat&#x27;s work in the 2010s consisted mainly of his period as the head writer of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; during the fifth through tenth series, in which he won another Hugo, and &quot;Sherlock&quot;, which won Moffat a BAFTA Craft Award and two Primetime Emmy Awards. In the 2020s, he wrote the BBC and Netflix drama co-productions &quot;Dracula&quot; (2020) and &quot;Inside Man&quot; (2022), the HBO sci-fi romance mini-series &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Wife&quot; (2022), and the ITV comedy-drama &quot;Douglas Is Cancelled&quot; (2024). In 2024, he returned to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to write two episodes for Davies&#x27; second tenure as showrunner.

== Early life ==
Moffat was born in Paisley, Scotland, where he attended Camphill High School. He studied at the University of Glasgow, where he was involved with the student television station Glasgow University Student Television. After gaining a Master of Arts degree in English from Glasgow, he worked as a teacher for three and a half years at Cowdenknowes High School, Greenock. In the 1980s he wrote a play entitled &quot;War Zones&quot; (performed at the 1985 Glasgow Mayfest and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe) and a musical called &quot;Knifer&quot;. He is an atheist.

== Career ==

=== &quot;Press Gang&quot; ===
Moffat&#x27;s father Bill was a head teacher at Thorn Primary School in Johnstone, Renfrewshire; when the school was used for Harry Secombe&#x27;s &quot;Highway&quot; in the late 1980s, Bill mentioned to the producers that he had an idea for a television series about a school newspaper. The producers asked for a sample script, to which Bill agreed on the condition his son Steven write it. Producer Sandra Hastie said that it was &quot;the best ever first script&quot; that she had read. The resulting series was titled &quot;Press Gang&quot;, starring Julia Sawalha and Dexter Fletcher, and it ran for five series on ITV between 1989 and 1993, with Moffat writing all forty-three episodes. The programme won a BAFTA award in its second series.

During production of the second series of &quot;Press Gang&quot;, Moffat was experiencing an unhappy personal life as a result of the break-up of his first marriage. The producer was secretly phoning his friends at home to check on his state. His wife&#x27;s new lover was represented in the episode &quot;The Big Finish?&quot; by the character Brian Magboy (Simon Schatzberger), a name inspired by Brian: Maggie&#x27;s boy. Moffat brought in the character so that all sorts of unfortunate things would happen to him, such as having a typewriter dropped on his foot.

=== &quot;Joking Apart&quot; ===

By 1990, Moffat had written two series of &quot;Press Gang&quot;, but the programme&#x27;s high cost along with organisational changes at backers Central Independent Television cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered what to do next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, &quot;Press Gang&quot;″s primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Inspired by his experience working in education, Moffat&#x27;s initial proposal was a programme similar to what became &quot;Chalk&quot;, a sitcom set in a school that eventually aired in 1997. During the pitch meeting at the Groucho Club, Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking passionately about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead of a school sitcom. Taking Ptaszynski&#x27;s advice, Moffat&#x27;s new idea was about &quot;a sitcom writer whose wife leaves him&quot;. Moffat wrote two series of &quot;Joking Apart&quot;, which was directed by Spiers and starred Robert Bathurst and Fiona Gillies. The show won the Bronze Rose of Montreux and was entered for the Emmys.

He wrote three episodes of &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot;, an anthology series of comedic tales starring Dawn French. The first (&quot;Overkill&quot;, directed by Spiers) was identified by the BBC as a &quot;highlight&quot; of the series. His other two episodes were &quot;Dying Live&quot; (dir. Dewi Humphreys) and &quot;Elvis, Jesus and Zack&quot; (dir. Tony Dow).

=== &quot;Doctor Who&quot; short fiction ===
Moffat has been a fan of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; since childhood. In 1995, he contributed a segment to Paul Cornell&#x27;s &quot;Virgin New Adventures&quot; novel &quot;Human Nature&quot;. His first solo &quot;Doctor Who&quot; work was a short story, &quot;Continuity Errors&quot;, published in the 1996 Virgin Books anthology &quot;Decalog 3: Consequences&quot;.

=== &quot;Chalk&quot; ===
Between marriages, Moffat claims that he &quot;shagged [his] way round television studios like a mechanical digger.&quot; According to an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Moffat met television producer Sue Vertue at the Edinburgh Television Festival in 1996. Vertue had been working for Tiger Aspect, a production company run by Peter Bennett-Jones. Bennett-Jones and his friend and former colleague Andre Ptaszynski, who had worked with Moffat on &quot;Joking Apart&quot;, told Moffat and Vertue that each fancied the other. A relationship blossomed and they left their respective production companies to join Hartswood Films, run by Beryl Vertue, Sue&#x27;s mother. The couple have two children together: Joshua and Louis Oliver.

Before Moffat left Pola Jones for Hartswood, Ptaszynski produced &quot;Chalk&quot;, the series that the writer had pitched to him at the beginning of the decade. Set in a comprehensive school and starring David Bamber as manic deputy head Eric Slatt and Nicola Walker as Suzy Travis, the show was based on Moffat&#x27;s three years as an English teacher. The studio audience responded so positively to the first series when it was taped that the BBC commissioned a second series before the first had aired. However, it was met less enthusiastically by critics upon transmission in February 1997, who had taken exception to the BBC&#x27;s publicity department comparing the show to the highly respected &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. In an interview in the early 2000s, Moffat refuses to even name the series, joking that he might get attacked in the street.

After production wrapped on &quot;Chalk&quot; in 1997, Moffat announced to the cast that he was marrying Vertue.

=== &quot;The Curse of Fatal Death&quot; ===
In late 1998, Moffat was approached by Vertue, a producer of Comic Relief, to write a comedic sketch based on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV series to be aired across Comic Relief&#x27;s 1999 telethon in several parts on BBC One. The sketch, &quot;The Curse of Fatal Death&quot;, was written from December 1998 to February 1999, recorded in February, and broadcast in March.

=== &quot;Coupling&quot; ===
When Vertue asked Moffat for a sitcom, he decided to base it around the evolution of their own relationship. &quot;Coupling&quot;, produced by Vertue, was first broadcast on BBC Two in 2000. &quot;Coupling&quot; ran for four series totalling 28 episodes until 2004, all written by Moffat. He also wrote the original, unbroadcast pilot episode for the U.S. version, also titled &quot;Coupling&quot;, although this was less successful and was cancelled after four episodes on the NBC network. Moffat blamed its failure on an unprecedented level of network interference.

=== &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the Russell T Davies era and &quot;Jekyll&quot; ===
In December 2003, Moffat received an email offering him to write for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, following the announcement of the revival of the series in September. His involvement with the series was announced in March 2004. He wrote six episodes under executive producer Russell T Davies for the 2005 through 2008 series, which were produced from December 2004 to March 2008. Moffat won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form for the two-part story &quot;The Empty Child&quot; and &quot;The Doctor Dances&quot; (both 2005), as well as the episodes &quot;The Girl in the Fireplace&quot; (2006) and &quot;Blink&quot; (2007). &quot;Blink&quot; also gained him the BAFTA Craft Award for Best Writer, and a BAFTA Cymru Award for Best Screenwriter.

Between &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes, Moffat wrote and produced &quot;Jekyll&quot;, a modern-day drama series based on the Robert Louis Stevenson novella &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, meaning he nearly missed out on writing for the 2007 series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Written late in the series&#x27; run, he quickly based &quot;Blink&quot; on his previously-written &quot;Doctor Who&quot; short story from 2005, &quot;What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow&quot;, as &quot;a desperate way to keep a toehold&quot; in the 2007 series. &quot;Jekyll&quot; aired on BBC One from June 2007.

In March 2008, Davies said that he often rewrote scripts from other writers, but did not &quot;touch a word&quot; of Moffat&#x27;s episodes.

=== &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Sherlock&quot;===
In October 2007, Reuters reported that Moffat would be scripting a trilogy of films based on Belgian artist Hergé&#x27;s character Tintin for directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson.

In May 2008, the BBC announced that Moffat would be succeeding Davies as lead writer and executive producer of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for the show&#x27;s fifth series, to be broadcast in 2010, although Davies had initiated discussions with Moffat regarding this as far back as July 2007. He had intended to complete work on the &quot;Tintin&quot; trilogy before resuming work on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, but delays caused by the intervening 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike meant he could only submit part of a script for the first film. Moffat told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2012 that Spielberg was &quot;lovely&quot; about his decision to walk away from his three-film &quot;Tintin&quot; contract to return to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The script for the first film in the trilogy, &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (released in 2011), was completed by Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish, with a part of Moffat&#x27;s script used in the film.

During their journeys from London to Cardiff for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Moffat and writer Mark Gatiss conceived a contemporary update of author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories called &quot;Sherlock&quot;. Vertue advised them to work on the project rather than spend years discussing it. A 60-minute pilot, written by Moffat, was filmed in January 2009. The pilot was not aired but a three-episode series of 90-minute television films produced by Hartswood was commissioned.

Production on Moffat&#x27;s time in charge of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; began in July 2009. As executive producer and lead writer, he was significantly involved in casting both Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor. As &quot;Doctor Who&quot; showrunner, Moffat won another Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form for writing the two-part story &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot; and &quot;The Big Bang&quot; (both 2010). As showrunner for &quot;Sherlock&quot; , he won a BAFTA Craft Award for Best Writer for &quot;A Scandal in Belgravia&quot; (2012), a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special for &quot;His Last Vow&quot; (2014), and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie for executive producing &quot;The Abominable Bride&quot; (2016).

In June 2015, Moffat was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services to drama. In January 2016, Moffat announced he was stepping down as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; lead writer and executive producer after the 2017 series, his sixth series as showrunner, with Chris Chibnall succeeding him at the start of the eleventh series for broadcast in 2018. The fourth and most recent series of &quot;Sherlock&quot; finished production around August 2016, and aired in January 2017. &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;—the 2017 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Christmas special, and Moffat&#x27;s last episode as lead writer and showrunner—finished production in July 2017 and broadcast on Christmas that year.

In March 2024, Moffat confirmed his return to writing for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in Series 14. On the episode “Boom” he was credited as both writer and as an Executive Producer.

=== &quot;Dracula&quot; ===
In October 2018, BBC One and Netflix officially commissioned &quot;Dracula&quot;, a TV series written and created by Moffat and Gatiss based on Bram Stoker&#x27;s 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot;. In March 2019, Moffat revealed that the first night of production was about to start. The series began airing New Year&#x27;s Day 2020, and was broadcast over three consecutive days. The three episodes were released on Netflix on 4 January 2020.

=== &quot;The Unfriend&quot; ===
On 13 February 2020, Chichester Festival Theatre announced that the play &quot;The Unfriend&quot;, written by Moffat, was intended to have its world premiere as part of the 2020 Festival Theatre season in the Minerva Theatre. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the play&#x27;s opening night was postponed until 26 May 2022. It was directed by Mark Gatiss and featured Amanda Abbington, Frances Barber, Reece Shearsmith, and Michael Simkins. Following a successful run in Chichester, the play transferred to the Criterion Theatre, London, in January 2023, and thence, with Sarah Alexander as Debbie, and Lee Mack as Peter, to Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in January 2024.

<text>Sensory deprivation or perceptual isolation is the deliberate reduction or removal of stimuli from one or more of the senses. Simple devices such as blindfolds or hoods and earmuffs can cut off sight and hearing, while more complex devices can also cut off the sense of smell, touch, taste, thermoception (heat-sense), and the ability to know which way is down. Sensory deprivation has been used in various alternative medicines and in psychological experiments (e.g. with an isolation tank). When deprived of sensation, the brain attempts to restore sensation in the form of hallucinations.

Short-term sessions of sensory deprivation are described as relaxing and conducive to meditation; however, extended or forced sensory deprivation can result in extreme anxiety, hallucinations, bizarre thoughts, and depression.

A related phenomenon is perceptual deprivation, also called the Ganzfeld effect. In this case a constant uniform stimulus is used instead of attempting to remove the stimuli; this leads to effects which have similarities to sensory deprivation.

Sensory deprivation techniques were developed by some of the armed forces within NATO, as a means of interrogating prisoners within international treaty obligations. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the use of the five techniques by British security forces in Northern Ireland amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment. 
It was also used in prisons such as Guantanamo.

==Restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST)==
There are many different numbers of basic methods of restricted environmental stimulation, including therapy (REST), chamber REST, and flotation REST.

===Chamber REST===
In chamber REST, the subject lies on a bed in a completely dark and sound-reducing (on average, 80 dB) room for up to 24 hours. Their movement is restricted by the experimental instructions, but not by any mechanical restraints. Food, drink, and toilet facilities are provided in the room and are at the discretion of the tester, who can communicate with the participants using an open intercom. Subjects are allowed to leave the room before the 24 hours are complete; however, fewer than 10% actually do because they find the chamber so relaxing.
Chamber REST affects psychological functioning (thinking, perception, memory, motivation, and mood) and psychophysiological processes.

===Flotation REST===
In flotation REST, the room contains a tank or pool. The flotation medium consists of a skin-temperature solution of water and Epsom salts at a specific gravity that allows for the patient to float supine without the worry of safety. In fact, to turn over while in the solution requires &quot;major deliberate effort.&quot; Fewer than 5% of the subjects tested leave before the session duration ends, which is usually around an hour for flotation REST.

Spas sometimes provide commercial float tanks for use in relaxation. Flotation therapy has been academically studied in the US and in Sweden with published results showing reductions of both pain and stress. The relaxed state also involves lowered blood pressure, lowered levels of cortisol, and maximal blood flow. Besides physiological effects, REST seems to have positive effects on well-being and performance.

===Chamber versus flotation REST===
Several differences exist between flotation and chamber REST. For example, with the presence of a medium in flotation REST, the subject has reduced tactile stimulation while experiencing weightlessness. The addition of Epsom salts to attain the desired specific gravity may have a therapeutic effect on hypertonic muscles. Since one of the main results of chamber REST is a state of relaxation, the effects of chamber REST on arousal are less clear-cut, which can be attributed to the nature of the solution.

Also, due to the inherent immobilization that is experienced in flotation REST (by not being able to roll over), which can become uncomfortable after several hours, the subject is unable to experience the session durations of chamber REST. This may not allow the subject to experience the changes in attitudes and thinking that are associated with chamber REST. Additionally, the research questions asked between each technique are different. Chamber REST questions stemmed from research that began in the 1950s and explored a variety of questions about the need for stimulation, the nature of arousal and its relationship with external stimulation. Practitioners in this area have explored its utility in the treatment of major psychiatric dysfunctions such as substance abuse. In contrast, flotation REST was seen more as a recreational tool and was tested primarily for use with stress-related disorders, pain reduction, and insomnia.

Numerous studies have debated which method is a more effective treatment process; however, only one has explored this statistically. Nineteen subjects, all of whom used chamber or flotation REST to induce relaxation or treat smoking, obesity, alcohol intake or chronic pain were analyzed. The statistic of interest, d, is a measure of the size of the treatment effect. For reference, d=0.5 is considered a moderate effect and d=0.8 a large effect. The 19 subjects who underwent chamber REST had d=0.53 and six flotation REST subjects showed d=0.33. Additionally, when examining subjects undergoing REST treatment and REST in conjunction with another treatment method, there was little difference.
However, Flotation REST has the advantage of a lower duration required (45 minutes as opposed to 24 hours).

== Sensory deprivation as a philosophical thought experiment ==
Sensory deprivation has been used to help support arguments by philosophers on how minds work. One example is the floating man argument proposed by Ibn Sīnā, whose primary objective is to affirm the existence of the human soul. 

=== Floating man argument ===
Ibn Sīnā, one of the most important philosophers of the medieval period, investigated the existence of the self and explored the self&#x27;s nature. Like many others, he proposed an argument to support his claim regarding the relationship between the mind and the body. He based his investigation on the Floating Man argument where, he proposes, a man floating in the air or a vacuum where he cannot perceive anything, not even the substance of air. This man is unable to see anything external; his arms and legs are separated from the rest of his body; they do not meet or touch. In other words, the man is experiencing extreme sensory deprivation in order to separate what physical body and any perception of stimuli that a person can experience from what consciousness might be in Ibn Sīnā&#x27;s thought experiment. The man later reflects on his existence. He will not question that he exists, but he will not be able to affirm if his legs, arms, or internal organs exist. He guarantees that his essence exists, but he will not have awareness of the length or depth of himself. Therefore, in the thought experiment, what the man can affirm to exist is the man&#x27;s self and what he cannot affirm does not make part of his essence, like an arm or a toe. The argument concludes then that since the man can affirm his existence while being subjected to extreme sensory deprivation, his soul is something different from his physical body. His soul is then said to be an immaterial substance separate from his body. This is considered a dualist argument in the philosophy of mind as it separates the mind from the body to affirm the existence of oneself.  

==== Dualism ====
Dualism presupposes that the world is made up of physical (perceived through the senses), and immaterial (not perceived through the senses) substances.

René Descartes was the philosopher who proposed Cartesian dualism, also called substance dualism, since it claims the existence of two kinds of “substances”: mental states and material stuff that takes up space. For Descartes, the mind is an entity, different from a physical entity since the mind, in Descartes&#x27; point of view, can exist independently, that is, without a physical body. For this reason, he concluded that the mind is a substance.

==Other uses==
The use of REST has been explored in aiding in the cessation of smoking. In studies ranging between 12 months and five years, 25% of REST patients achieved long-term abstinence. REST, when combined with other effective smoking cessation methods (for example: behavior modification) resulted in long-term abstinence of 50%. Also, when combined with weekly support groups, REST resulted in 80% of patients achieving long-term abstinence. Comparatively, the use of a nicotine patch alone has a success rate of 5%.

Alcoholism has also been the target of research associated with REST. In conjunction with anti-alcohol educational messages, patients who underwent two hours of REST treatment reduced alcohol consumption by 56% in the first two weeks after treatment. The reduction in consumption was maintained during follow-ups conducted three and six months after the first treatment. It is, however, possible that this is caused by the placebo effect.

In addition, REST has been tested to determine its effect on users of other drugs. A University of Arizona study used chamber REST as a complement to traditional outpatient substance abuse treatment and found that four years later, 43% of the patients were still sober and drug-free. Eight months later, no one in the control group remained clean.

===Psychedelic effects===
Studies have been conducted to test the effect of sensory deprivation on the brain. One study took 19 volunteers, all of whom tested in the lower and upper 20th percentiles on a questionnaire that measures the tendency of healthy people to see things not really there, and placed them in a pitch-black, soundproof booth for 15 minutes, after which they completed another test that measures psychosis-like experiences, originally used to study recreational drug users. Five subjects reported seeing hallucinations of faces; six reported seeing shapes/faces not actually there; four noted a heightened sense of smell, and two reported sensing a &quot;presence of evil&quot; in the room. People who scored lower on the first test experienced fewer perceptual distortions; however, they still reported seeing a variety of hallucinations.
Many studies have been conducted to understand the main causes of the hallucinations, and considerable evidence has been accumulated indicating that long periods of isolation aren&#x27;t directly related to the level of experienced hallucinations.

Schizophrenics appear to tend to experience fewer hallucinations while in REST as compared to non-psychotic individuals. A possible explanation for this could be that non-psychotic individuals are normally exposed to a greater degree of sensory stimulation in everyday life, and in REST, the brain attempts to re-create a similar level of stimulation, producing the hallucinatory events.
According to a 2009 study published in the &quot;Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease,&quot; the hallucinations are caused by the brain misidentifying the source of what it is currently experiencing, a phenomenon called faulty source monitoring.
A study conducted on individuals who underwent REST while under the effects of Phencyclidine (PCP) showed a lower incidence of hallucination in comparison to participants who did not take PCP. The effects of PCP also appeared to be reduced while undergoing REST. The effects PCP has on reducing occurrences of hallucinatory events provide a potential insight into the mechanisms behind these events.

===Interrogation===
Sensory deprivation has been used to disorientate subjects during interrogation, brainwashing, and torture. In particular, the five techniques of &quot;wall-standing; hooding; subjection to noise; deprivation of sleep; deprivation of food and drink&quot; were used by the security forces in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s. After the Parker Report of 1972, these techniques were formally abandoned by the United Kingdom as aids to the interrogation of paramilitary suspects.

The Irish government on behalf of the men who had been subject to the five methods took a case to the European Commission of Human Rights (&quot;Ireland v. United Kingdom&quot;, 1976 Y.B. Eur. Conv. on Hum. Rts. 512, 748, 788–94 (European Commission of Human Rights)). The Commission stated that it &quot;considered the combined use of the five methods to amount to torture.&quot; This consideration was overturned on appeal, when in 1978 the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) examined the United Nations&#x27; definition of torture. The court subsequently ruled that the five techniques &quot;did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture,&quot; however they did amount &quot;to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment,&quot; which is a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 3.

In their judgment the court states that:
:These methods, sometimes termed &quot;disorientation&quot; or &quot;sensory deprivation&quot; techniques, were not used in any cases other than the fourteen so indicated above. It emerges from the Commission&#x27;s establishment of the facts that the techniques consisted of:&quot;
::* wall-standing: forcing the detainees to remain for periods of some hours in a stress position, described by those who underwent it as being &quot;spreadeagled against the wall, with their fingers put high above the head against the wall, the legs spread apart and the feet back, causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers&quot;;
::* hooding: putting a black or navy colored bag over the detainees&#x27; heads and, at least initially, keeping it there all the time except during interrogation;
::* subjection to noise: pending their interrogations, holding the detainees in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise;
::* deprivation of sleep: pending their interrogations, depriving the detainees of sleep
::* deprivation of food and drink: subjecting the detainees to a reduced diet during their stay at the center and pending interrogation

<text>Michael James Jackson (27 March 1942 – 30 August 2007) was an English writer and journalist. He was the author of many influential books about beer and whisky. He was a regular contributor to a number of broadsheets, particularly &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;.

Jackson&#x27;s books have sold over three million copies worldwide and have been translated into 18 languages. He is credited with helping to start a renaissance of interest in beer and breweries worldwide in the 1970s, particularly in the United States. He is also widely credited with popularising the idea of beer styles. His influential television series &quot;The Beer Hunter&quot; was shown in fifteen countries.

He was as well-versed in malt whisky as he was in beer, and his book &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s Malt Whisky Companion&quot; (1989) was the best-selling book on the subject in the world.

Jackson developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease a bit more than a decade before his death. He did not declare his illness until its symptoms caused some to think he was inebriated.

==Life==
Jackson was born in Wetherby, West Riding of Yorkshire. His father had his Lithuanian Jewish surname Jakowitz to Jackson. The family moved to Leeds after World War II. He went to King James&#x27;s Grammar School, Almondbury, and became a journalist, particularly being associated with Edinburgh, where he first encountered whisky. On his return to London, he briefly edited the advertising trade journal &quot;Campaign&quot;.

Michael Jackson became known in beer circles in 1977 when his book &quot;The World Guide to Beer&quot; was first published. This was later translated into more than 10 languages and is still considered to be one of the most fundamental books on the subject. The modern theory of beer style is largely derived from this book, in which Jackson categorised a variety of beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names.

His work had a particular influence on the popularisation of the brewing culture in North America, and in 1989 he hosted a television series entitled &quot;The Beer Hunter&quot;, which was shown on Channel 4 in the UK and on the Discovery Channel. It involved several episodes in which Jackson would visit a different country. Episodes featured beer barrels being lined with pitch, and iron foundry workers drinking &quot;light&quot; beer while they worked in hot conditions to quench thirst, practices which he knew were likely to be ended soon.
Jackson considered beer as a component of culture and described beers in their cultural context. Although he travelled around the world and discovered different beer cultures, he was especially fond of the Belgian beers. He was appointed to an honorary officer of the &quot;Ridderschap van de Roerstok&quot; in 1997 for his important contribution to the international success of the Belgian beers. This honour had previously only been given to brewers. In 1998, Jackson designed and sold 4 beer glasses called &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s Great Beer Glassware Set&quot;, each glass for a different type of beer, produced by Rizenhoff Crystal. Shortly after, Jackson also helped create and worked with the only beer club he ever endorsed, Michael Jackson&#x27;s Rare Beer Club.

Jackson was a reviewer of whiskies, in his book &quot;The Malt Whisky Companion&quot;, he reviewed a large number of whiskies and gave them marks from 0–100, considering only those with a score above seventy-five worth purchasing. He received the award of &quot;Master of the Quaich&quot;.

Apart from his work as a journalist and a critic, he was also a fan of rugby league.

Jackson disclosed in December 2006 that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease over a decade earlier. He also had diabetes.

Jackson died of a heart attack in his home on the morning of 30 August 2007 at the age of 65. He was survived by his girlfriend of 26 years, Paddy Gunningham, and her daughter and grandchildren.

<text>A fried egg is a cooked dish made from one or more eggs which are removed from their shells and placed into a frying pan and cooked. They are traditionally eaten for breakfast or brunch in many countries but may also be served at other times of the day.

== Regional adaptations and specialities ==
=== Austria, Germany, and Switzerland ===


Fried eggs (&#x27;; singular &#x27;) are a crucial part of such traditional German dishes as &#x27; (the egg is fried on one side with an unbroken yolk, and served &quot;sunny side up&quot; atop an open ham sandwich) or &#x27; / &#x27; / &quot;Fernfahrerschnitzel&quot; (&quot;trucker&#x27;s schnitzel&quot;) – a similarly prepared fried egg served on a &#x27;.

Fried eggs over (or side-by-side with) pan-fried potatoes is another common dish, sometimes served with spinach as a third component of the meal. Some German cooks break the yolk and distribute it across the surface of the white during the frying.

All of the above are typically lunch, rather than breakfast, dishes, although eggs themselves (like boiled or scrambled eggs) are a common part of a German breakfast.

=== Cambodia and Vietnam ===
In Cambodia, a fried egg is often served on top of a common dish called beef lok lak. It is made of a ring of spinach, onion finely shaven, and tomato with either a portion of venison or beef with gravy, topped with a fried egg, either duck or chicken egg.

In Vietnam, a fried egg (Trứng ốp la) is served over white rice, topped with a dab of oyster or hoisin sauce; this is also popular in east Asia. Fried eggs are also sometimes used in a &quot;bánh mì&quot;.

=== Indonesia ===

In Indonesia, fried eggs are served either as &quot;telur ceplok&quot; or &quot;telur mata sapi&quot; (Indonesian for &quot;bull&#x27;s eye egg&quot;) which refer to sunny side up eggs, as &quot;telur dadar&quot; (omelette) or as &quot;telur orak-arik&quot; (scrambled eggs). The fried eggs are either &quot;setengah matang&quot; which is half cooked with still runny yolk or &quot;matang&quot; which is well done. When speaking English, an Indonesian waiter may ask if you want the egg fried &quot;one side&quot; or &quot;two sides&quot;. Fried eggs, especially bull&#x27;s eye egg, are a popular topping for Indonesian fried rice (&quot;nasi goreng&quot;) and fried noodle (&quot;mie goreng&quot;), either freshly prepared noodle or cooked from instant noodle Indomie Mi goreng. 

A simple dish of fried sunny side up egg served on top of steamed rice drizzled with &quot;kecap manis&quot; sweet soy sauce, is a favourite dish among Indonesian children. Other than served with rice, fried eggs might be served with bread as a sandwich for breakfast. Seasoning includes salt and pepper, sweet soy sauce, and sometimes hot and spicy &quot;sambal&quot; chili paste.

=== Ireland and the United Kingdom ===

Fried eggs can be served on toast, or in a sandwich, with bacon, sausages, and a variety of condiments. Eggs are often part of the full breakfast commonly eaten in Britain and Ireland. Fried eggs are often served with ham or gammon steak as a popular pub meal. The egg is cooked on high heat and hot fat, oil, or water may be splashed onto the top of the egg to baste it and cook the white. They are usually cooked without turning over.

=== Hispanic and Lusitanic world ===
In Portugal and Brazil, a runny egg placed over a steak with a side dish of rice and fried potatoes (and the addition of black beans in Brazil) is called a &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;horse-riding steak&quot;.

A similar dish, with the name &quot;&quot; in Spanish, is also common in Argentina, Ecuador, and Uruguay (called &quot;churrasco&quot;); fried potatoes and salad replace the beans and rice.

In Chile and Peru, a fried egg is included in &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;&quot;, and several other dishes.

In Ecuador, &quot;llapingachos&quot; include a sunny-side up egg served over pan-seared cheesy mashed potatoes and fried sausage.

In northern Mexico, &#x27; (riding eggs) are served with refried beans and fried potatoes (or french fries). Another common method of serving eggs in Mexico is &#x27;, which blends fried eggs with diced tomato, onion, and green chili pepper; the amount of pepper added is often to order.

There are several other egg dishes in Mexico which combine different ingredients: Huevos motuleños (in Yucatán), &#x27; (mixed with refried beans), and &#x27; (sunny side up eggs served over a corn tortilla, covered with spicy salsa). Also, in some parts of Mexico, fried eggs are served with fresh tomato, onions, and cilantro salsa. Red chili is optional, as is a blended sauce.

In Spain fried eggs (&quot;huevos fritos&quot;) are a common dish. They are eaten alone, with meat, or with sausages. In this country, a fried egg served with boiled rice covered in tomato sauce is called &quot;arroz a la cubana&quot; in Spanish and the same dish is served in parts of Latin America, Italy (so-called &quot;occhio di bue&quot;, transl: ox&#x27;s eye), the Philippines, and Portugal as well.

Poet Nazım Hikmet says, in an interview, that he stayed with a Spanish friend for a month and ate fried eggs almost every day.

=== Malaysia and Singapore ===
Just as in Indonesia, nasi goreng, one of the popular fried rice dish in Malaysia and Singapore is often served with a fried egg.

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, a fried egg (&quot;) is normally served on top of a slice of bread (white or whole wheat), often with fried bacon, for breakfast or lunch.

An &#x27; is a dish consisting of two or three fried eggs, sunny side up. One version is fried together with ham and cheese (&#x27;), or bacon and cheese (&#x27;). Another version is placed on buttered bread over a generous slice of cold meat, e.g., cooked ham or beef, similar to the German &quot;Strammer Max&quot; or &quot;Strammer Otto&quot;, and usually garnished with a dill pickle. It is a common lunch dish served in many cafes, canteens, and lunch rooms in the Netherlands. &#x27;, which literally means &quot;out-thrower&quot;, is a Dutch word for a bouncer.

=== Nigeria ===
What is known as &quot;scrambled eggs&quot; in the US and UK is called &quot;fried eggs&quot; in Nigeria, while what is known as &quot;fried eggs&quot; in the US and UK would be known as &quot;half-fried eggs&quot; in Nigeria. The mai shai stalls cook scrambled eggs to the point of being heavily crisp.

=== Philippines ===

In the Philippines, fried eggs are often cooked like a sunny-side egg but the yolk is half cooked - referred to as malasado (from the Spanish, meaning undercooked) - by sprinkling it with salt and oil while being fried, giving it a distinctive pink-colored membrane. Garlic rice (&quot;sinangag&quot;) with an egg (&quot;itlog&quot;) is a common combination known as &quot;silog&quot;, usually served with a choice of breakfast meat 
such as beef &quot;tapa&quot; to make it &quot;tapsilog&quot;, longaniza (&quot;longsilog&quot;), fried milkfish, dried fish, &quot;tocino&quot; (caramelised pork), Spam, or corned beef, etc. In addition, fried eggs are eaten in a dish called Arroz a la cubana, which is seasoned ground beef with raisins, cubed potatoes, tomato sauce, and olives, along with white rice and fried ripe plantains. Fried eggs are also a main ingredient in the noodle dish Pancit Batil Patong, where a fried egg is topped over stir-fried noodles.

=== Thailand ===

In Thai cuisine, when the words &#x27; (lit. &quot;star egg&quot;) are placed after the name of a dish, it means that one wants that dish accompanied by a fried egg. The very popular &#x27; for instance, translates to &quot;basil fried pork on top of rice with a fried egg&quot;. Sometimes this is referred to as a &quot;top egg&quot;. Fried rice is also popularly accompanied with a fried egg, such as with &quot;khao phat Amerikan&quot; and &quot;khao phat&quot; (standard Thai-style fried rice). Another popular way of eating fried eggs in Thailand is to use it as the main ingredient of the Thai salad called &quot;yam khai dao&quot;.

=== United States and Canada===
North Americans use different terms to describe the degree and method to which fried eggs are cooked, including:

; Over easy &quot;or&quot; over light
: Cooked on both sides; the yolk is runny and the egg white is fully cooked.
; Over medium
: Cooked on both sides; the yolk is cooked through but soft and near liquid at the center. The egg white is thoroughly cooked.
; Over hard &quot;or&quot; over well
: Cooked on both sides all the way through, with the yolk broken (immediately after the egg is cracked).
; Sunny-side up
: Cooked on one side only, until the egg white is set, but the yolk remains liquid. Gently splashing the hot cooking oil or fat over the sunny side uncooked white may be done to thoroughly cook the white. Covering the frying pan with a lid during cooking (optionally adding a cover and half-teaspoon of water just before finishing) allows for a less &quot;runny&quot; egg, and is an alternative method to flipping for cooking an egg over easy (this is occasionally called &quot;sunny side down&quot; or &quot;basted&quot;). Sunny-side up eggs are also commonly referred to as &quot;dippy eggs&quot; or &quot;dip eggs&quot; by Pennsylvania Dutch people living in central Pennsylvania, in parts of Ohio, and in Pittsburgh mainly due to the practice of dipping toast into the yolk while eating. This term is also occasionally used in Canada. They are also sometimes called &quot;moon eggs&quot; by those residing in eastern Maryland.

== Egg in the basket ==
The name &quot;toad in the hole&quot; is sometimes used for this dish, particularly in the U.S., though that name more commonly refers to sausages cooked in Yorkshire pudding batter. This dish is usually made by cutting a circle or other shape out of a slice of bread, often using a drinking glass or biscuit cutter. The bread is fried until brown on one side and then flipped, and an egg is broken into the center and seasoned, usually with salt and pepper, and sometimes herbs. The pan is then covered, and the egg is cooked until the white is just set. The cutout center of the bread is often fried as well and served alongside or on top of the finished egg.

<text>Andreu Nin i Pérez (; 4 February 1892 – 20 June 1937) was a Spanish politician, trade unionist and translator. He is mainly known for his role in various Spanish left-wing movements of the early 20th century and, later, for his role in the Spanish Civil War. He is also known for his work translating Russian classics such as &quot;Ana Karenina&quot;, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and some works by Anton Chekhov, from Russian into Catalan.

A teacher and journalist, during his youth he was involved in various political movements until he joined the anarchist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). During his stay in Russia, he witnessed the Russian Revolution, which marked his conversion to Marxism. After his return to Spain, he later became one of the founders of the small but active Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). He eventually became a leading figure in Spanish revolutionary Marxism. He disappeared during the course of the Spanish Civil War, having been arrested by the Republican authorities following the &quot;May Days&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born on 4 February 1892 in the Tarragona town of El Vendrell, the son of a cobbler and a peasant woman. Despite his modest origins, thanks to his parents&#x27; efforts and his intelligence, he managed to become a teacher and move to Barcelona shortly before World War I. Although he taught for a time in a secular, libertarian school, he soon turned to journalism and politics.

In 1911 he joined the ranks of the Catalan federalist movement, joining the Republican Nationalist Federal Union (UFNR), but the social unrest that existed at the time quickly led him to evolve towards more left-wing politics. The year 1917 was a key year in his life: events such as the August general strike, the Russian Revolution and the struggles between Barcelona&#x27;s employers and the trade unions, especially the National Confederation of Labour (CNT), had a profound effect on him. Although he first joined the ranks of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), he soon embraced the cause of revolutionary syndicalism and joined the CNT, where, after attending the second congress in 1919, he defended its membership of the Communist International and replaced Evelio Boal, who had been assassinated, as general secretary of the National Committee. In November 1920, Nin himself suffered an attack by the Sindicatos Libres that almost cost him his life.

===Political activity===

At the CNT national plenary meeting held in Lleida on 28 April 1921, he was elected as one of the delegates to be sent to Moscow to the 3rd World Congress of the Communist International and the founding congress of the Red Trade Union International (Profintern) along with Joaquín Maurín, Hilario Arlandis and Jesús Ibáñez; becoming a key figure in both internationals (the CNT had left the Communist International in 1922). During his trip to Moscow he came to admire the Russian Revolution, after which he abandoned anarchism and became a Marxist. Nin, who was also to attend the second congress of the Profintern, lived for a time in Moscow, during which time he first worked for Nikolai Bukharin and later became the secretary of Leon Trotsky, one of the Bolshevik leaders during the revolution. Thanks to a job at the Profintern, Nin was able to visit France, Italy and Germany. From 1926 onwards, he belonged to the &quot;Left Opposition&quot; led by Trotsky, which opposed the rise of Joseph Stalin within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, so Nin had to leave the USSR in 1930. He became fluent in the Russian language and later produced several Catalan translations of classic nineteenth-century Russian novelists.

====Second Republic====

On his return to Spain after the proclamation of the Second Republic, Nin was instrumental in the formation of a Trotskyist group, the Communist Left of Spain (ICE), in May 1931. The ICE soon became a group affiliated to the International Left Opposition and went on to publish the newspaper &quot;El Soviet&quot;. Although it had some very prominent militants, the Communist Left was too small a group to have any real influence on Spanish political life. Although it was considered a Trotskyist party opposed to Stalin, from his exile in Norway, Trotsky himself sharply criticised its political line.

During the Revolution of 1934, he was a member of the and took part in the events of 6 October in Catalonia. After earlier criticism of his political line, he ended up breaking with Trotsky after he did not accept his attempt to adopt an entryist tactic in the PSOE. When his group merged with Joaquín Maurín&#x27;s Workers and Peasants&#x27; Bloc (BOC) to found the Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) in 1935, Nin was appointed a member of the new party&#x27;s executive committee and editor of its publication, &quot;La Nueva Era&quot;; the following year he was elected general secretary of the POUM.

In May 1936, he was also elected general secretary of the (FOUS), which had a strong trade union presence in the provinces of Lleida, Girona and also Tarragona.

====Spanish Civil War====

After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Andreu Nin became the leader of the POUM. Until July 1936, the party had a very limited presence in the Catalan political sphere and even less in the rest of Spain. From then on, Nin and other POUM leaders began to make themselves known outside their home provinces and often spoke out in public. On 2 August, in statements to the daily &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;, Nin declared:

After serving on the Consell d&#x27;Economia de Catalunya between August and September 1936, Nin was appointed Minister of Justice of the Generalitat on 26 September. On 14 October 1936 he introduced the People&#x27;s Courts by decree. However, Nin&#x27;s tenure as Minister of Justice was widely disputed. During those months extra-judicial executions continued to take place, without Nin taking action. As historian Hugh Thomas notes, &quot;Nin had not been known for his humanitarian scruples towards the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;&quot;. The POUM militias also contributed to the repression of &#x27;fascists&#x27; and &#x27;enemies of the people&#x27;. In the autumn, Nin had raised with the President of the Generalitat, Lluís Companys, the possibility of taking in as a refugee Leon Trotsky, who at that time had been forced to leave Norway under Soviet pressure. This idea was not to the liking of the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC), who also participated in the government of the Generalitat. On 24 November, the PSUC handed the CNT a proposal on the establishment of a new government of the Generalitat, which included the departure of Nin as Minister of Justice. Many anarchist members and leaders were not too fond of Nin, whom they considered a renegade from the CNT, and so they resolved that it was more a conflict between Marxists. Nin continued to hold the post until 16 December, when he was removed following a reshuffling of the council. When explaining the reasons, as Nin later recounted in his interrogation, Josep Tarradellas also warned him of the danger to both the POUM and its leaders.

During the spring of 1937 the Republican police located an alleged letter written by Nin to Francisco Franco, in which the Trotskyist leader was to endorse a plan for an uprising by the Madrid fifth column; the letter, in reality a forgery by the NKVD, constituted one of the main pieces of evidence against Nin. After the May Events, the Communist campaign against the POUM intensified. Its leaders were openly accused of being fascists and conspiring with Franco. As early as 28 May, Communist pressure got the authorities to suspend the circulation of the party&#x27;s newspaper, La Batalla.

On 14 June the Director General of Security, Colonel Antonio Ortega Gutiérrez, informed the Minister of Education and Health that the head of the NKVD in Spain, Alexander Orlov, had indicated to him that all POUM leaders should be arrested. The minister, who was the Communist Jesús Hernández Tomás, went to speak directly to Orlov about this matter. The NKVD chief claimed that there was evidence linking the Trotskyist party to Franco&#x27;s espionage and that it was necessary for the government not to be aware of this plan because the Minister of the Interior, Julián Zugazagoitia, was a friend of some of the POUM leaders. On 16 June the Republican authorities closed down the POUM headquarters in the Hotel Falcón and the party leadership was arrested by the police. According to the testimony of Julián Gorkín, the Republican police were accompanied by two foreigners, whom Gorkín suspected of being Soviet secret service agents. Andreu Nin was separated from the rest of the party leadership, like Julián Gorkin and José Escuder, who were held in prisons in Madrid and Barcelona. After being separated from the rest, Nin disappeared.

===Controversy over his death===
Nin was transferred to the city of Alcalá de Henares, near Madrid; the chosen location had become an important Soviet base in Republican Spain and therefore offered guarantees of security. It has subsequently been claimed that Andreu Nin was subjected to interrogation and torture in the days following his arrest. Hugh Thomas notes that Nin was transported by car from Barcelona and then taken to the Cathedral of Alcalá de Henares, which functioned as a private prison of the Soviet NKVD. Some claim that he died in Alcalá de Henares. However, various circumstances surrounding his death, such as whether or not he was tortured before his execution, remain unclear. According to Paul Preston, Nin was possibly killed on 22 June by flaying, on Orlov&#x27;s orders and with the help of Iosif Grigulevich. There is little doubt that the order for Nin&#x27;s execution came from Moscow. Thomas, for his part, claims that he may have been killed in El Pardo park, near Madrid, but the final fate of his remains remains a mystery. Nin&#x27;s biographer, Francesc Bonamusa, would comment on this:

Within days of his arrest, rumours began to spread in Republican Spain that Andreu Nin had been assassinated. A campaign spread with the slogan: &quot;Where is Nin?&quot; (, ) The former Minister of Health, the anarchist Federica Montseny, was one of the first personalities to raise the question in public. In the Republican government itself they were not quite sure what had happened: several Socialist ministers questioned the two Communist ministers, who claimed not to know anything about the affair. The semi-official version that began to circulate was that Nin had been liberated from Checa by &quot;his friends in the Gestapo&quot;. This was claimed by Juan Negrín, head of the Republican government. Communist circles began to reply &quot;In Salamanca or Berlin&quot;, referring to Salamanca, the early headquarters of the Nationalists. According to Ricardo Miralles and Hugh Thomas, Negrín would have been aware of the truth about what had happened from the beginning despite echoing the Gestapo&#x27;s implausible version; Thomas adds that the Nin case was in fact a &#x27;dirty affair&#x27;, but that the Republican leaders decided it was better not to bother the Soviets in order to continue receiving the precious military aid. On the other hand, Republican leaders and ministers did not particularly like the leader of this small party, which they regarded as a mere &quot;group of agitators who were damaging the war effort&quot;. Julián Zugazagoitia, however, commented that this action had been carried out without the knowledge and/or consent of the Republican government. In February 1938 a hit-squad related to POUM and Sección Bolchevique-Leninista de España shot a Soviet agent held responsible for the detention of Nin, Leon Narwicz.

<doc id="294808" wikidata="Q1445246" url="?curid=294808" title="Franklin Graham">
<text>William Franklin Graham III (born July 14, 1952) is an American evangelist and missionary in the evangelical movement. He frequently engages in Christian revival tours and political commentary. The son of Billy Graham, he is president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) and of Samaritan&#x27;s Purse, an international evangelical Christian humanitarian aid organization. Under his leadership, Samaritan’s Purse has become a leading global Christian relief organization, providing emergency assistance in crisis zones worldwide, including large-scale responses in Ukraine, Pakistan, and other regions affected by conflict or natural disasters. Graham has been considered as one of the most influential and best-known evangelicals in America, leading one of the largest charitable organizations in the United States, with $1.111 billion in private donations.

Graham became a &quot;committed Christian&quot; in 1974 and was ordained in 1982, and has since become a public speaker and author.

==Early life and education==
William Franklin Graham III was born in Asheville, North Carolina, on July 14, 1952, to evangelist Billy Graham and Ruth Graham. He is the fourth of their five children. Following local tradition, Franklin was given the family name, which had been passed down to the eldest son. His grandfather was named William Franklin Graham and was known as Frank within the family. His father, William Franklin Graham II, was called Billy Frank by his parents. Franklin was named William Franklin Graham III and called Franklin by his parents, to avoid confusion.

His father, Billy Graham, was one of the world’s most renowned evangelists, and civil rights advocate. The father originated from North Carolina, was of Scots-Irish descent. His mother, Ruth Graham (née Ruth McCue Bell), was a Chinese-born American, born in Qingjiang, Jiangsu, China to American medical missionaries serving at a Presbyterian hospital 300 miles north of Shanghai. She was raised in China in a devoutly religious household. His maternal grandfather, Lemuel Nelson Bell, served as a medical missionary in China for over 20 years and co-founded &quot;Christianity Today&quot;.

Graham was raised in a log home in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, surrounded by a family deeply committed to Christian ministry. During Franklin Graham’s childhood, the Graham family lived in a house near Asheville, North Carolina. As his father, Billy Graham, gained national recognition, an increasing number of tourists began visiting their home daily. To ensure greater privacy, the family purchased several acres of land in the mountains outside of Montreat, North Carolina, where they built a log house named &quot;Little Piney Cove&quot;. Since Billy Graham was frequently away preaching, Franklin’s mother, Ruth Graham, oversaw the construction of the home. Even after relocating to &quot;Little Piney Cove&quot;, the Graham family occasionally faced harassment from strangers, including death threats directed at Billy Graham by radical groups. Due to security concerns, the FBI recommended installing a security fence with electronic gates around the property. According to Franklin Graham, the family agreed to the measures, which effectively deterred unwanted intrusions.

Billy Graham was often absent during his children&#x27;s upbringing, leaving his wife to take on the primary role in maintaining the family. In his autobiography, Franklin Graham recounted an incident in which his mother, upon discovering that he had been smoking, required him to smoke an entire pack of cigarettes as a disciplinary measure. He noted that a similar method had been used in his father Billy Graham’s childhood, when his own father employed the same approach to deter him from smoking.

As a teenager, Graham attended The Stony Brook School, a Christian private school on Long Island, New York, but was expelled mid senior year. In his autobiography, Graham stated that he was very unhappy there and developed a &#x27;prisoner of war mentality’. He refused to conform to the school’s order or way of thinking and repeatedly broke the rules, including the prohibition on smoking. He finished Owen High School in North Carolina, close to his home.

In 1970, Graham attended LeTourneau College in Longview, Texas, and was expelled from the school for keeping a female classmate out past curfew. In 1973, Graham joined Bob Pierce, founder of Samaritan&#x27;s Purse, on a six-week mission to Asia. During this trip, Graham decided to focus on world relief. In 1974, he graduated from Montreat-Anderson College, now Montreat College, with an A.S. That same year on a trip to Jerusalem, he repented and experienced a new birth. After his studies, Graham was involved in administrative work related to preparation of his father’s crusades. In 1978 he graduated from Appalachian State University with a B.A.

He was ordained in 1982 by the Grace Community Church in Tempe, Arizona, a non-denominational church.

== Ministerial career ==
Graham gained his first experience in ministry in 1975 when he was invited by Bob Pierce, President of Samaritan’s Purse, to accompany him on an international trip. The journey included visits to missionary and refugee camps, hospitals, and meetings with government officials, church leaders, and missionaries in South Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand, India, and Nepal.

In 1979, after the death of Pierce, he became the president of Samaritan&#x27;s Purse. According to Graham, he built the organization in close cooperation with the Board, mirroring it after the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) by adopting its policies and procedures.

In 1982, Franklin Graham was ordained, marking the beginning of his evangelistic career. He denied that he was groomed to become a successor of his father. He argued that God had called him for his own work in the Samaritan&#x27;s Purse.

In 1989, Franklin Graham held his first evangelistic event, continuing his father’s preaching to large audiences in stadiums and other venues worldwide. He has preached at more than 325 outreaches across all 50 U.S. states and territories, as well as in over 55 countries. Since 1989, Graham has delivered sermons in Mexico, Poland, Vietnam, Italy, United Kingdom, and other countries.

In early 1990&#x27;s Franklin Graham was second second vice-chairman of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA). He was the only child of Billy Graham on the BGEA&#x27;s board. It was speculated that Franklin Graham could become his father’s successor in ministry; however, he denied that he could fulfill the role in the same way as Billy Graham. In 1995, Franklin Graham became vice-president of the BGEA. According to Billy Graham&#x27;s biographer, the decision to appoint his son, Franklin, as the head of the BGEA was initially controversial among some long-time employees who were critical of Franklin&#x27;s lifestyle that clashed with the organization&#x27;s conservative corporate traditions. At the same time, Franklin&#x27;s father remained chairman and chief executive.

According to Billy Graham&#x27;s autobiography, Franklin Graham gradually assumed greater leadership responsibilities within the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) as his father reduced his public engagements and administrative duties due to declining health. During this transition, Franklin took on more day-to-day operations within the organization. Billy Graham stated that Franklin’s experience as the president of a global Christian relief and evangelism organization made him well-qualified to lead BGEA. In 2000, Franklin Graham was named the CEO of the organization, since his father retired from ministry. According to the BGEA spokeswoman, it was his father’s decision to let his son take charge. In 2001, Franklin Graham succeeded his father, Billy Graham, as President of BGEA. According to Billy Graham, board of directors unanimously elected Franklin to succeed him as President of BGEA.

Franklin Graham continued the crusade ministry following his father&#x27;s final evangelistic event, the Greater New York Crusade, held in June 2005. In 2006, Billy Graham preached alongside Franklin at two events: the Celebration of Hope in New Orleans and the Metro Maryland Festival in Baltimore.

Throughout his long ministry, Franklin Graham has had several documented encounters with U.S. presidents that have coincided with significant national events. For example, during his early career, Graham met with President Jimmy Carter. This meeting was linked to his father, Billy Graham’s, longstanding relationship with Carter dating back to the 1973 Atlanta Crusade and later integrated evangelical outreach activities in Georgia. Franklin Graham also met with former President George H. W. Bush during events that included the dedication of the Billy Graham Library and prayer services held during the Gulf War. At President George W. Bush’s inauguration, Franklin Graham delivered a prayer of invocation.

== Humanitarian Efforts ==
As president of Samaritan’s Purse, Franklin Graham has overseen a broad range of humanitarian relief efforts in response to conflicts, natural disasters, and other emergencies around the world.

In 1978, while studying at Appalachian State University, Franklin Graham was approached by surgeons Lowell and Dick Furman from Boone, North Carolina, who proposed establishing an organization to send Christian physicians to missionary hospitals for short-term voluntary service. Graham agreed to assist with administrative responsibilities and initiated contact with approximately 30 mission hospitals to assess the need for short-term medical assistance. Following a positive response, World Medical Mission, the medical ministry of Samaritan’s Purse, was founded.

Under Graham, the Samaritan’s Purse has become one of the largest Christian charitable organizations in the US. According to the Forbes 2024 ranking, the Samaritan&#x27;s Purse was ranked 13th among the 100 largest charitable organizations in the United States, with $1.111 billion in private donations. While it occasionally partners with U.S. government agencies, only about 5% of its budget in recent years has come from federal grants. 

Franklin Graham has regularly called on the global Christian community to pray for those affected, emphasizing prayer for peace in Ukraine, the Middle East, and other crisis zones. He has also stated that Samaritan’s Purse ‘does not force religion on anyone’ but shares Christian faith while meeting urgent needs. 

Regarding the Trump administration’s 90-day freeze on USAID, Graham is supportive. “I think it’s a good thing for the government to assess and reexamine the various programs that the U.S. is funding around the world,” Graham said. However, Graham added, “the details of the waiver process are not yet clear.” Less than 5% of Samaritan’s Purse’s budget for 2024 came from government grants.

=== Operation Christmas Child ===
In 1993, Franklin Graham was contacted by British businessman Dave Cooke, who had founded Operation Christmas Child in 1990. Initially, the project involved collecting shoeboxes filled with gifts for children in Romania after the Cold War. Cooke asked Graham if he would help expand the initiative by providing shoeboxes filled with gifts for children affected by the war in Bosnia. Under Graham&#x27;s leadership, Samaritan’s Purse officially took over Operation Christmas Child. In November 2022, Samaritan’s Purse celebrated a milestone by distributing its 200 millionth shoebox through Operation Christmas Child.

=== 2007 Mexico Floods ===
In November 2007, Graham led Samaritan’s Purse in responding to severe flooding in Mexico’s Tabasco region. With the support of local churches and relief teams he distributed survival kits, deployed community water filtration systems, and coordinated medical care for those stranded by floodwaters. 

=== Ukraine ===
In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Graham deployed Samaritan’s Purse disaster response specialists to Poland and Romania, providing medical supplies, food, and temporary shelter. The charity also shipped and delivered over 600,000 Operation Christmas Child shoebox gifts to children in Ukraine, and set up field hospitals to treat the wounded.

The organization has also conducted airlifts to deliver medical supplies, food, and relief items, as well as provided training to local healthcare providers. As of September 2022, Samaritan’s Purse had conducted at least 30 airlifts carrying essential relief and medical equipment into Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian government, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse has been operating in Ukraine since the start of the hostilities in Ukrainian Donbas in 2014. Since the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022, the organization, through local partners, has been delivering food, water, warm clothing, and medical assistance. During the organization&#x27;s work in Ukraine, Franklin Graham visited the teams operating the hospital and offering medical assistance. More than 9.6 million Ukrainians have benefited from this aid. The organization has established cooperation with 2,000 Ukrainian partners.

=== 2022 Pakistan Floods ===
In August 2022, following severe monsoon flooding that devastated one-third of Pakistan, Franklin Graham directed Samaritan’s Purse to launch an immediate relief operation. During August and September the provided help included distribution of emergency food, water filtration kits, shelter materials, and hygiene supplies to thousands of affected families. Graham emphasized the importance of demonstrating Christian compassion, aligning with his approach of deploying rapid assistance to global disaster zones. 

=== 2023 Gaza war ===
In October 2023, during the Israel–Hamas conflict, Graham visited Israel to assess humanitarian needs and provide assistance through Samaritan’s Purse. The organization pledged to send replacement ambulances, trauma kits, and essential medical supplies, partnering with over 50 local churches to distribute relief to displaced families in both Israel and Gaza. 

==Political views==
===Donald Trump (2017–2021)===
In April 2011, Graham told ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; program that Donald Trump, who had recently declared an interest in the Republican nomination for the 2012 U.S. presidential race, was his preferred candidate. During an MSNBC &quot;Morning Joe&quot; interview on February 21, 2012, Graham said that Rick Santorum was most closely aligned to Christian values in his words and deeds and that Senator Santorum was certainly a Christian at heart. On President Obama, Graham said that he is &quot;a fine man,&quot; but could not know whether the president was a Christian in his heart. Asked about Mitt Romney, Graham said that most Protestants do not view Mormonism as a Christian faith.

In June 2016, Graham told a crowd, &quot;I have zero hope for the Democratic Party; I have no hope for the Republican Party. I am running a campaign to put God back in the political process.&quot; Nevertheless, in November 2016, Graham told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that God had played a role in Donald Trump&#x27;s election as U.S. president, saying: &quot;I could sense going across the country that God was going to do something this year. And I believe that at this election, God showed up.&quot; The same newspaper noted that the day after Trump&#x27;s victory, Graham had posted a comment on Facebook in which he wrote, &quot;Did God show up? […] In watching the news after the election, the secular media kept asking &#x27;How did this happen?&#x27; &#x27;What went wrong?&#x27; &#x27;How did we miss this?&#x27; Some are in shock. Political pundits are stunned. Many thought the Trump/Pence ticket didn&#x27;t have a chance. None of them understand the God-factor.&quot; At the Inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2017, Graham chose to read a passage from Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to Timothy, chapter 2, which calls for prayers for all people, including &quot;kings and for all those in authority, that we may live peacefully quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.&quot;

Since the 2016 election, Graham has been a prominent supporter of Trump’s policies. He has strongly opposed the impeachment process, calling it an &quot;unjust inquisition.&quot; In a November 21, 2019, interview with Eric Metaxas, Graham suggested opposition to Trump was the work of a &quot;demonic power.&quot; In December, when &quot;Christianity Today&quot; magazine, founded by Graham&#x27;s father Billy, published an editorial calling Trump &quot;profoundly immoral&quot; and supporting his removal from office, Graham responded by saying his father had voted for Trump and saw him as the &quot;man for this hour in history for our nation&quot; and that the magazine was &quot;representing the elitist liberal wing of evangelicalism.&quot;

In mid-December 2020, Graham wrote about the first Trump presidency on Facebook, saying that &quot;President Trump will go down in history as one of the great presidents of our nation, bringing peace and prosperity to millions here in the U.S. and around the world.&quot;

In January 2021, Graham compared the ten Republican members of the House of Representatives who voted to impeach Trump to Judas Iscariot, suggesting that the Democrats had promised them &quot;thirty pieces of silver&quot;.

=== North Carolina Amendment 1 ===
Graham supported North Carolina Amendment 1, which was passed by a voter referendum on May 8, 2012, prohibiting same-sex marriage and all domestic partnerships. Graham responded to Obama&#x27;s May 9, 2012, statement of support for same-sex marriage, saying, &quot;President Obama has, in my view, shaken his fist at the same God who created and defined marriage. It grieves me that our president would now affirm same-sex marriage, though I believe it grieves God even more.&quot;

In December 2017, several British MPs urged the Home Secretary to consider refusing UK entry to Graham from speaking at an event due to take place in Blackpool in September 2018. As Graham represents the evangelical community, critics argued that those who want to ban Graham which means that individuals who have different opinions of LGBT rights would be banned in the UK. Gordon Marsden, an openly gay Labour MP suggested that Graham&#x27;s comments may have contravened British laws on hate speech. As of February 2018, a petition against Graham being granted a visa had gathered more than 7,500 signatures. The pastor of Liberty Church in Blackpool, who organized the petition, said: &quot;As a Christian and as a leader of a church that particularly welcomes LGBT people, I&#x27;m horrified that other local churches are inviting someone with this record of hate speech.&quot; The pastor said that Graham&#x27;s visit had triggered an &quot;enormous amount of protest from Christians in the north-west&quot; of England, and his presence would be &quot;extremely destructive in the area&quot;.

===2025 Donald Trump inauguration===
At the inauguration ceremony for President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025, Graham gave an invocation in which he thanked God for Trump&#x27;s win and for assisting America in its recovery from a &quot;pretty dark&quot; period over the previous four years.

===Foreign policy views===
==== Support of the Iraq War ====
Graham supported the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.

==== Opposition to indicting Sudan&#x27;s Al-Bashir ====
When Sudanese president Omar Hassan al-Bashir was indicted by the International Criminal Court in March 2009, Graham argued in an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Bashir should not be indicted for alleged genocidal acts because the indictment would lead to the collapse of the 2005 peace agreement.

====Commentary about Vladimir Putin====
In a February 28, 2014 opinion piece titled &quot;Putin&#x27;s Olympic Controversy: Morality &amp; Nations in a Changing World,&quot; Franklin Graham defended aspects of Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s policy that banned &quot;propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations to minors.&quot; Graham argued that the law was intended to protect children from what he considered harmful influences. He noted that American media and liberal activists had reacted strongly against the law, while he contrasted this reaction with what he perceived as a decline in American moral standards.

Graham also acknowledged that Putin’s background—as a former KGB officer and a political figure with personal controversies—leads some critics to label him as ruthless and compare him to a modern czar. He stated, &quot;To be clear, I am not endorsing President Putin. To survive in the KGB and rise to power in Russia, you have to be tough.&quot; Despite his reservations about other aspects of Putin’s leadership, Graham expressed the opinion that on the specific issue of protecting children, Putin’s policy was justified.

==== Political support for Ukraine ====
Franklin Graham visited Ukraine in March 2022, immediately after the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Graham conducted an Easter Sunday sermon from Ukraine and addressed both Presidents Putin and Zelensky, calling for a 10-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine in observance of the Easter holiday.

== Reception and controversies ==
=== COVID vaccination ===
Graham has said in interviews and social media posts that he believes Jesus would approve of the COVID-19 vaccine, saying &quot;that&#x27;s what Jesus Christ would want us to do, to help save life. It&#x27;s just a tool to help save life.&quot; He has compared the vaccine to the oil and wine the Good Samaritan used to treat the wounds of the injured traveler, saying &quot;Now the oil and wine were the medicines of that day.&quot; He told ABC News, &quot;I think for a pastor to tell someone not to take the vaccine is problematic because what would happen if that person got coronavirus and died?&quot;

Graham has also cited the work of Samaritan&#x27;s Purse in describing his support for the vaccine. &quot;We have seen what COVID can do,&quot; said Graham, citing Samaritan&#x27;s Purse work to help during the outbreaks in Cremona, Italy; Los Angeles; North Carolina and the Bahamas.

Graham has also spoken of seeing the effects of the virus in his own organization. &quot;I&#x27;ve had some of my own staff, one of them was on a ventilator for three months, Graham said in an interview with CBS News, &quot;...from what I have seen and experienced myself, I don&#x27;t want COVID and I don&#x27;t want anybody else to get it.&quot; Graham stated that he and his wife are both vaccinated. He also stated, &quot;I want people to know that COVID-19 can kill you. But we have a vaccine out there that could possibly save your life. And if you wait, it could be too late.&quot;

=== Islam ===
Graham came under criticism for comments he made about Islam in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks when he referred to Islam as &quot;a very evil and wicked religion.&quot; Further criticism came on April 18, 2003, when he preached at a Good Friday service at the Pentagon. Graham has made controversial remarks against Islam saying, &quot;True Islam cannot be practiced in this country,&quot; to CNN&#x27;s Campbell Brown in December 2009. &quot;You can&#x27;t beat your wife. You cannot murder your children if you think they&#x27;ve committed adultery or something like that, which they do practice in these other countries.&quot; On April 22, 2010, after objections from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation and the Muslim group Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Pentagon rescinded his invitation from the Christian conservative National Day of Prayer Task Force to speak at a Pentagon National Day of Prayer event.

In the August 30, 2010, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;Does America Hate Islam?&quot; Graham reportedly said that Islam &quot;is a religion of hatred. It&#x27;s a religion of war.&quot; Building the cultural center near Ground Zero, he says, means Muslims &quot;will claim now that the World Trade Center property...is Islamic land.&quot;

In September 2010, Graham stated on ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; with Christiane Amanpour that building churches and synagogues is forbidden in most countries in the Islamic world.

=== Two salaries ===
Franklin Graham drew scrutiny in 2009 for drawing a full-time salary from Samaritan&#x27;s Purse while simultaneously receiving a full-time salary from Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA). This was called into question after his 2008 compensation from both organizations totaled $1.2 million. (Most of this was the result of a new IRS rule that required him to re-report deferred retirement contributions that had already been reported over the previous three years.) Some experts on non-profit organizations have questioned whether one person can perform two full-time jobs leading organizations that employ hundreds and spend hundreds of millions around the world. In response to the questions about his compensation, Graham decided to give up his salary from BGEA, stating his calling to the ministry &quot;was never based on compensation.&quot; He also had contributions to his retirement plans suspended until the economy bounced back. However, Graham was again criticized in 2015 when it was revealed he had again taken up his salary from BGEA where his annual compensation was significantly higher than that of the CEO&#x27;s of similar, but much larger, non-profit organizations.

According to 2014 data, Graham is the highest paid Samaritan&#x27;s Purse employee at $622,252 annually and leads other charities in compensation. The preacher gave up a salary at the evangelistic association during the late economic downturn, but the leaders urged him to accept compensation again and he now receives increased retirement contributions as well as a regular salary. The evangelistic association reported 2013 revenues as $106.5 million and 2014 as $112,893,788.

=== Barack Obama (2009–2017) ===
On August 19, 2010, when asked by CNN correspondent John King if he had doubts that President Barack Obama is a Christian, Graham stated, &quot;I think the president&#x27;s problem is that he was born a Muslim; his father was a Muslim. The seed of Islam is passed through the father like the seed of Judaism is passed through the mother. He was born a Muslim, his father gave him an Islamic name.&quot; Graham continued, &quot;Now it&#x27;s obvious that the president has renounced the prophet Mohammed, and he has renounced Islam, and he has accepted Jesus Christ. That&#x27;s what he says he has done. I cannot say that he hasn&#x27;t. So I just have to believe that the president is what he has said.&quot; In a March 2011 interview with the conservative Internet publication &quot;Newsmax&quot;, Graham claimed officials in the Obama administration had connections to the Muslim Brotherhood:
The Muslim Brotherhood is very strong and active in our country. It&#x27;s infiltrated every level of our government. Right now we have many of these people that are advising the US military and State Department on how to respond in the Middle East, and it&#x27;s like asking a fox, like a farmer asking a fox, &quot;How do I protect my henhouse from foxes?&quot; We&#x27;ve brought in Muslims to tell us how to make policy toward Muslim countries. And many of these people we&#x27;ve brought in, I&#x27;m afraid, are under the Muslim Brotherhood.

On February 28, 2012, Graham responded to a one-page letter sent by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) as an: &quot;Open Letter from Leaders of Faith Regarding Statements by Franklin Graham.&quot; In the introduction to the one-page letter, the fourteen signatories stated: &quot;We are greatly troubled by recent attempts by some religious leaders to use faith as a political weapon. We were disturbed and disappointed by statements made by Rev. Franklin Graham during an interview on MSNBC that questioned whether President Obama is a Christian.&quot; In closing, the open-letter stated: &quot;We call on Rev. Graham and all Christian leaders to exemplify this essential teaching of Jesus and refrain from using Christianity as a weapon of political division.&quot;

In an open letter response, Graham apologized to President Obama, saying, &quot;I regret any comments I have ever made which may have cast any doubt on the personal faith of our president, Mr. Obama. The president has said he is a Christian and I accept that.&quot; In the open letter closing Graham stated, &quot;In this election season and challenging economic time I am praying for our country and for those who lead it—for we are commanded in Scripture to do so.&quot;

=== Hinduism ===
Graham has commented on Hinduism as well, saying, &quot;No elephant with 100 arms can do anything for me. None of their 9,000 gods is going to lead me to salvation.&quot;

=== Support for conversion therapy ===
In 2017 Graham spoke against a bill proposing to ban conversion therapy. Referencing the biblical text of Leviticus 18:22, he said, &quot;Homosexuality is defined by God as sin, an abomination to Him.&quot; He also compared conversion therapy to conversion to Christianity.

=== Buttigieg tweets ===
After South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg became the first openly gay man to announce a run for the 2020 Democratic nomination for President against President Donald Trump, Graham attacked Buttigieg for his homosexuality and marriage to another gay man in April 2019, tweeting &quot;Mayor Buttigieg says he&#x27;s a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man &amp; a woman—not two men, not two women.&quot; The tweet was one of three in a thread.

The tweet was met with a strong negative response against Graham, much of which condemned Graham as a hypocrite for selective criticism of a Democratic candidate&#x27;s perceived wrongdoings while remaining silent on those perceived of the incumbent Republican. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough denounced Graham on his &quot;Morning Joe&quot; program, saying, &quot;Just shut up Franklin Graham! You are a disgrace! You are a disgrace for normalizing Donald Trump&#x27;s behavior.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist Jennifer Rubin rebuked Graham as a &quot;hypocritical bigot&quot; who &quot;has rationalized Trump&#x27;s infidelity and racism, ignored his lies, cheered his inhumane immigration policy and behaved as a political hack rather than a religious leader,&quot; also writing &quot;Buttigieg gets the benefit of being attacked by a right-winger whom progressives revile, gets to underscore a message of generational change and acceptance and gets to demonstrate what a class act he is. The other candidates must be wondering why some GOP hatemonger doesn&#x27;t attack them.&quot; Opinion pieces in the &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, and &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; were also critical of Graham&#x27;s comments.

=== UK tour 2020 and 2022 ===
All venues booked for Franklin Graham&#x27;s planned eight-city 2020 UK tour cancelled his booking after protests by LGBTQ+ activists, petitions and requests from local councils. Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, stated Liverpool is proud of its LGBT+ community and would challenge hatred and intolerance. Graham&#x27;s organisation said it would seek other venues. Many opponents said statements Graham had made were incompatible with their values, and that his appearance would be divisive, could be disruptive, or lead to a breach of the peace. After threatening legal action for breach of contract and giving assurances to venues that his preaching would not be discriminatory, Graham&#x27;s tour was rescheduled for mid-2022.

== Awards and honors ==

In 2005, TIME magazine recognized Franklin Graham as one of the most influential evangelicals in the United States (&quot;The 25 most influential evangelicals in America&quot;). Graham was also inducted into the Hall of Faith by the Southern Baptist Evangelists.

<doc id="294809" wikidata="Q2838032" url="?curid=294809" title="Anglo-Portuguese Alliance">
<text>The Anglo-Portuguese Alliance (, &quot;Luso-English Alliance&quot;) is the oldest alliance that is still in force by political bilateral agreement. It was established by the Treaty of Windsor in 1386, between the Kingdom of England (since succeeded by the United Kingdom) and the Kingdom of Portugal (now the Portuguese Republic), though the countries were previously allied via the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373.

Since the signing of the Treaty of Windsor, the Kingdom of Portugal and the Kingdom of England, and later the modern Portuguese Republic and United Kingdom, have never waged war against each other, nor have they participated in wars on opposite sides as independent states (with one brief exception as described below). While Portugal was subsumed under the Iberian Union, rebellious Portuguese factions and government in exile sought refuge and help in England. England spearheaded the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) on the side of the deposed Portuguese royal house.

The alliance has served both countries throughout their respective military histories, influencing the participation of the United Kingdom in the Peninsular War, the UK&#x27;s major land contribution to the Napoleonic Wars and the establishment of an Anglo-American base in Portugal. Portugal aided England (and later the UK) in times of need, for example, in the First World War. Today, Portugal and the United Kingdom are both part of NATO.

==Middle Ages==
English aid to the House of Aviz (which ruled Portugal from 1385 to 1580) set the stage for Portuguese cooperation with England that would become a cornerstone of Portugal&#x27;s foreign policy for more than five hundred years. However, English aid to Portugal went back much further to the 1147 Siege of Lisbon, when English and other northern European crusaders – en route to the Holy Land to participate in the Second Crusade – stopped and helped Portuguese King Afonso Henriques to conquer the city from the Moors. In May 1386, the Treaty of Windsor sealed the alliance – first started in 1294, renewed in the Treaty of Tagilde in 1372 and the ensuing Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 and confirmed at the Battle of Aljubarrota (1385) – with a pact of perpetual friendship between the two countries. The most important part of the treaty stated that:

In July 1386, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, son of the late king Edward III of England and father of the future King Henry IV of England, landed in Galicia with an expeditionary force to press his claim to the Crown of Castile with Portuguese aid. He failed to win the support of the Castilian nobility and returned to England with a cash compensation from the rival claimant.

John of Gaunt left behind his daughter, Philippa of Lancaster, to marry King John I of Portugal (February 1387) in order to seal the Anglo-Portuguese alliance. By this marriage, John I became the father of a generation of princes called by the poet Luís de Camões the &quot;Illustrious Generation&quot;, which led Portugal into its golden age, during the period of the Discoveries.

Philippa brought to the court the Anglo-Norman tradition of an aristocratic upbringing and gave her children good educations. Her personal qualities were of the highest standard, and she reformed the court and imposed rigid standards of moral behaviour. On the other hand, the more tolerant Portuguese aristocracy saw her methods as too traditional or outdated.

Philippa provided royal patronage for English commercial interests that sought to meet the Portuguese desire for cod and cloth in return for wine, cork, salt, and oil shipped through the English warehouses at Porto. Her eldest son, Duarte, authored moral works and became king in 1433; Pedro, who travelled widely and had an interest in history, became regent (1439–1448) after Duarte died of the plague in 1438; Ferdinand the Saint Prince (1402–1443), who became a crusader, participated in the attack on Tangiers in 1437; and Henrique – also known as Prince Henry the Navigator (1394–1460) – became the master of the Order of Christ and the instigator and organiser of Portugal&#x27;s early voyages of discovery.

==Disruption and renewal==
The Iberian Union (1580–1640), a 60-year dynastic union between Portugal and Spain, interrupted the alliance. The struggle of Elizabeth I of England against Philip II of Spain in the sixteenth century meant that Portugal and England were on opposite sides of the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) and the Dutch–Portuguese War. Portuguese foreign policy became tied to Spanish hostility to England. England also captured the Portuguese garrison of Ormuz in Persia in 1622.

However, in 1640, England supported the Portuguese House of Braganza to take power in Portugal replacing the House of Habsburg, putting an end to a 60-year dynastic union between Portugal and Spain. England&#x27;s support for Portugal during their Restoration War was confirmation of the renewal of the alliance. This was solidified further after the English Restoration and the marriage of Catherine of Braganza and Charles II of England. Portugal ceded Tangier and Bombay as part of the dowry. England, in addition to military support on the ground, would protect Portuguese shipments in the Mediterranean and the coasts of Lisbon and Porto. Following the defeat of Spain in the war, England mediated the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668 which saw the independence of Portugal and the recognition of Pedro II as King. The English alliance was decisive in the consolidation of the independence of Portugal, and in Pedro&#x27;s leadership. In return Portugal promised to transfer to the English the majority of the places recovered from the Dutch, to share in half the commerce of cinnamon and to install English families with the same privileges as Portuguese families in Goa, Cochin, Diu, Bahia, Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro.

==17th to 19th centuries==
The alliance was reconfirmed after the breakup of the Iberian Union, primarily due to both countries&#x27; respective rivalries with Spain, the Netherlands, and France, both in Europe and overseas. During this time, important episodes in the alliance were:

* The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), when Portugal together with the Duchy of Savoy initially sided with France, but after the Battle of Blenheim reunited with its ally.
* The Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), when Spain invaded Portugal in 1762; Britain intervened as Portugal&#x27;s ally. Although faced with vastly superior numbers, the Portuguese and British forces together with Portuguese militia and peasants defeated the Spanish and French forces, which suffered huge losses during their three invasion attempts.
* The Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), when Portugal, isolated in a Europe wholly dominated by Napoleon, continued to trade with the United Kingdom despite French restrictions and was finally invaded, but with British help finally regained total sovereignty and independence. The Portuguese royal family at the time (including Prince John, at the time acting as regent for his mother, the aged and mentally impaired Queen Maria I) took refuge in its then vice-royalty of Brazil, under escort by the British fleet. The Portuguese also helped the failed British invasions of the River Plate. 
* The Portuguese Civil War (1828–1834), when the United Kingdom gave important support to the Liberal faction.
* The 1890 British Ultimatum, where under pressure by Cecil Rhodes, the British government gave an ultimatum to the Portuguese government to withdraw from the region of modern-day Botswana and refrain from furthering their colony of Portuguese East Africa. This was done in response to an expedition by Serpa Pinto into the region. The 1890 ultimatum was said to be one of the main causes for the Republican Revolution, which ended the monarchy in Portugal 20 years later.

==20th century==
During the 20th century, the treaty was invoked several times:

===First World War===
* After German incursions in Portuguese East Africa (today Mozambique), Portuguese troops fought on the Western Front alongside Allied soldiers during the First World War.

===Interwar===
* Portugal provided assistance to Spain during the Spanish Civil War, while the United Kingdom pursued non-intervention and neutrality.

===Second World War===
* Upon the declaration of war in September 1939, the Portuguese government announced on 1 September that the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance remained intact, but since the British did not seek Portuguese assistance, Portugal would remain neutral. In an aide-mémoire of 5 September 1939, the British government confirmed the understanding. British strategists regarded Portuguese non-belligerency as &quot;essential to keep Spain from entering the war on the side of the Axis.&quot;
* On 15 May 1940, Douglas Veale, the Registrar of the University of Oxford, informed Portuguese Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar that the University of Oxford&#x27;s Hebdomadal Council had &quot;unanimously decided at its meeting last Monday, to invite you to accept the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Civil Law&quot;.
* July 1940: Salazar&#x27;s decision to stick with the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance allowed the Portuguese island of Madeira to help the Allies: that month, around 2,500 Gibraltar evacuees were shipped to Madeira.
* September 1940: Winston Churchill wrote to Salazar, congratulating him on his ability to keep Portugal out of the war, asserting that &quot;as so often before during the many centuries of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance, British and Portuguese interests are identical on this vital question&quot;.
* Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood, the British Ambassador in Madrid from 1940 to 1944, recognised Salazar&#x27;s crucial role in keeping Iberia neutral during the war. Lord Templewood asserted that in his thirty years of political life he had met most of the leading statesmen of Europe and that he placed Salazar very high on the list of those who impressed him. He stated that Salazar &quot;being a man of one idea – the good of his country – he was convinced that the slightest step from the narrow path of neutrality would endanger the work of national regeneration to which he had devoted the whole of his public life&quot;. He also affirmed that &quot;Salazar detested Hitler&quot;, that the Portuguese régime differed fundamentally from Nazism and Fascism, and that Salazar never left a doubt in his mind that he desired a Nazi defeat.
* During the Second World War, Salazar steered Portugal down a middle path, but nevertheless provided aid to the Allies. The British Ambassador in Lisbon, Ronald Campbell, saw Salazar as fundamentally loyal to the Alliance and stated that &quot;he [Salazar] would answer the call if it were made on grounds of dire necessity&quot;. When, in August 1943, the British requested base facilities in the Azores and invoked the alliance that had existed for over 600 years between Portugal and Great Britain, Salazar responded favourably and virtually at once: Portugal granted naval bases on Portuguese territory to Britain, in keeping with the traditional Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, letting them use the Azorean ports of Horta (on the island of Faial) and Ponta Delgada (on the island of São Miguel), and the airfields of Lajes Field (on Terceira Island) and Santana Field (on São Miguel Island).
* In November 1943, the British Ambassador in Lisbon, Sir Ronald Campbell, wrote (paraphrasing Salazar) that &quot;strict neutrality was the price the allies paid for strategic benefits accruing from Portugal&#x27;s neutrality and that if her neutrality instead of being strict had been more benevolent in our favour Spain would inevitably have thrown herself body and soul into the arms of Germany. If this had happened the Peninsula would have been occupied and then North Africa, with the result that the whole course of the war would have been altered to the advantage of the Axis.&quot;
* From November 1943, when the British gained the use of the Azores, to June 1945, 8,689 U.S. aircraft departed from the Lajes Base in the Azores, including 1,200 B-17 and B-24 bomber aircraft which were ferried across the Atlantic. Cargo aircraft carried vital personnel and equipment to North Africa, to the United Kingdom and – after the Allies gained a foothold in Western Europe – to Orly Field near Paris. Flights returning from Europe carried wounded servicemen. Medical personnel at Lajes, Azores, handled approximately 30,000 air evacuations &quot;en route&quot; to the United States for medical care and rehabilitation. By using Lajes Field, it was possible to reduce flying time between the United States and North Africa from 70 hours to 40. This considerable reduction in flying hours enabled aircraft to make almost twice as many crossings per month between the United States and North Africa and clearly demonstrated the geographic value of the Azores during the war.

===Postwar===
* Portugal and the United Kingdom were two of the founding members of NATO, in 1949.
* The establishment of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) took place in 1960 following the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957. Portugal and the UK were two of the seven founding members of EFTA. In 1973 the UK left EFTA to join the EEC alongside with Denmark and Ireland. Portugal did the same in 1986 alongside with Spain.
* During the 1982 Falklands War, the facilities of the Azores were again offered to the Royal Navy.

==21st century==
On 13 June 2022, the Prime Minister of Portugal and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom signed a new agreement between the two nations in London, known as the UK-Portugal Joint Declaration on Bilateral Cooperation, thereby reinforcing the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance and confirming its status as the longest-running alliance still in force. The Joint Declaration was also signed to celebrate the 650th anniversary of the Treaty of Tagilde.

The 650th anniversary of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 was officially commemorated by both nations on 16 June 2023. The British government stated at this time that they intend to enter into &quot;a new bilateral Defence Agreement, due to be signed later in the year, set to take our defence cooperation to the next level.&quot;

Both countries continue to be members of the wider military alliance, NATO.

<text>A&amp;W Restaurants, Inc. (also known as Allen &amp; Wright Restaurants) is an American fast food restaurant chain distinguished by its &quot;Burger Family&quot; combos, draft root beer and root beer floats. A&amp;W&#x27;s origins date back to 1919 when Roy W. Allen set up a roadside drink stand to offer a new thick and creamy drink, root beer, at a parade honoring returning World War I veterans in Lodi, California. Allen&#x27;s employee Frank Wright partnered with him in 1922 and they founded their first A&amp;W restaurant in Sacramento, California, in 1923. The company name was taken from the initials of their last names – Allen and Wright. The company became famous in the United States for its &quot;frosty mugs&quot; – the mugs were kept in a freezer and filled with A&amp;W Root Beer just before being served to customers.

Evolving into a franchise in 1926, the company today has over 900 locations in 16 countries, with 460 in the United States, Southeast Asian countries and Germany, serving a fast-food menu of hamburgers, hot dogs and french fries. A number of outlets serve as drive-in restaurants that have carhops. Previously owned by Yum! Brands, the chain was sold in December 2011 to a consortium of A&amp;W franchisees through A Great American Brand, LLC. A&amp;W restaurants in Canada have been part of a separate and unaffiliated chain since 1972.

==History==
===Founding and early years===
On June 20, 1919, Roy W. Allen opened his first root beer stand in Lodi, California. The first day was for a homecoming celebration of soldiers who returned from battle in World War I. The following day, his stand was open for regular customers, selling root beer glasses for 5 cents (). The following year, Allen opened a second stand in Stockton, California. Shortly afterward, the effect of the period of prohibition that existed in the United States from 1920 to 1933 gave Allen and his stand with a beverage with &quot;beer&quot; in the name a heavy rebound. Four years later, A&amp;W began when Allen and Frank Wright opened their drive-in restaurant in Sacramento, California, combining both of their initials for the name, and selling the root beer from Allen&#x27;s stand. Curbside service was provided by tray boys and tray girls. In 1924, Allen purchased Frank Wright&#x27;s stake in the business. In 1925, Allen began franchising the root beer, while the franchisee added the other menu items and operated at their discretion. Most of the restaurants that opened under this scheme were on the highways of the Central Valley region, mainly for travelers. This may have arguably been the first successful food-franchising operation. Allen sold the company in 1950 and retired.

A&amp;W&#x27;s initial menu relied heavily on root beer and snacks, such as popcorn and peanuts, as well as sandwiches on sliced bread.

In 1927, J. Willard Marriott gained franchise rights for Washington, D.C. and the neighboring cities of Baltimore and Richmond. Subsequently, he moved to Washington to open a root beer stand with Hugh Colton. These stands subsequently became Hot Shoppes, paving the way for the later creation of one of the largest hospitality corporations in the world. As of 1933, A&amp;W had a total of 171 stands, increasing to 260 by 1941.

A&amp;W survived the Great Depression and labor shortages during World War II but benefitted from the post-war recovery of the American economy, with fast food and drive-in restaurants beginning to take shape. The first franchise convention was held in La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1949, but was limited to Wisconsin franchisees.

===Expansion===
In the expansion years of the 1950s and 1960s, franchisees were signing 20- or 25-year contracts under the older model. The chain expanded into Canada in 1956, opening restaurants in Winnipeg and Montreal. By 1960, A&amp;W had 2,000 restaurants. In November 1956, F. R. &quot;Fran&quot; Loetterle became the president of the chain.

In 1963, the chain opened its first store on Okinawa, which at the time was under American control. In the following years, the chain branched into other foreign markets, including Guam (first territory outside of the American continent to open a restaurant, in 1961), opened by Scotty Moylan, Mexico, the Philippines (some sources say it opened in the 1990s) and Malaysia. The first restaurant in Malaysia (Malaya at the time) was opened on December 24 that year by Al and Geri Lieboff, a couple from Las Vegas, who got the franchising rights for Malaysia and Singapore. Setting up the chain seemed to be complicated, as they were unable to find a proper site, and in the recruitment process, Malayans had no consent to adorning Western &quot;cabaret girl&quot; style clothes. Already at the time of setup, kids were starting to favor chicken, burgers, and hot dogs rather than rice and curry, and within the next five years, would also see a rise in new locations up to 22 within five years.

The first restaurant in Europe opened in Mannheim (near Stuttgart), West Germany in 1962. At the time, a city influenced by US military presence, the restaurant was showing signs of success for its novelty, the first drive-in restaurant in Germany, and had already made headlines in German newspapers. At the time, it was the 2283rd overall founded by the chain. There were already plans to introduce restaurants and drive-ins in other key European markets, such as the United Kingdom, according to the chain&#x27;s president.

Dale Mulder opened up a Lansing, Michigan A&amp;W franchise in 1961. In 1963, Mulder added the bacon cheeseburger to his menu after a customer made repeated orders for bacon to be added to his cheeseburger. Thus A&amp;W is credited with inventing the bacon cheeseburger.

===United Fruit Co. and United Brands Company subsidiary===
In 1963, the company was sold again, followed by another sale in 1967 to United Fruit Co. conglomerate. AMK Corporation purchased United Fruit in 1970. Then AMK formed United Brands Company to hold A&amp;W.

In 1971, A&amp;W Beverages Inc.—a beverage subsidiary—began supplying bottled A&amp;W products to grocery stores. The bottled products would become available nationally. In 1972, A&amp;W&#x27;s Canadian division was sold to Unilever.

A&amp;W attempted to open restaurants in mainland Japan in the early 1970s, specifically in Fukuoka prefecture and the regions of Kanto and Kansai. The chain&#x27;s performance on the mainland was sluggish in contrast to Okinawa due to several factors, such as the 1973 oil crisis, prompting the chain to withdraw from the market. A&amp;W&#x27;s Japanese operations are still handled from Okinawa. There were further fruitless attempts to bring the chain to the mainland: in the 1980s, the Okinawan branch briefly attempted to open restaurants in Kagoshima Prefecture but ended up limiting itself to Okinawa, while in the 2000s a pilot restaurant existed in Tokyo, which was quickly withdrawn.

1978 saw the introduction of a standard menu for use in all restaurants in the USA.

In the 1970s, A&amp;W had more stores than McDonald&#x27;s, with a peak in 1974 of 2,400 units. Oshkosh, Wisconsin, franchise manager Jim Brajdic said: &quot;Problems back then, including a lawsuit, franchisee discontent, and inconsistencies in the operation, caused the chain to flounder and branches to close.&quot; A&amp;W moved to a modern-style franchise agreement that introduced royalty payments and new standards. However, many franchisees refused the revised terms as their 20- or 25-year original agreements expired. In 1980, the number of restaurants had fallen to 1,300 in the United States (mostly in the Midwest and the North West), Asia, and Europe. In 1980, the Singaporean franchisee Temenggong Ltd. had increased the number of restaurants in the country, while nine new restaurants were planned in Malaysia. There were also plans to open restaurants in the Philippines and Hong Kong. In 1983, A&amp;W opened its first restaurant in Thailand, at the Central Ladprao shopping mall in Bangkok.

In 1985, A&amp;W began offering the Third Pounder to compete with McDonald&#x27;s Quarter Pounder. As advertised, the Third beat the Quarter in taste tests and was less expensive by weight. In his 2007 memoir, former owner A. Alfred Taubman claimed research had revealed that it had been unsuccessful in part due to Americans&#x27; widespread innumeracy, specifically their inability to understand fractions: 1/3 was perceived as smaller than 1/4 (due to the smaller denominator) despite being a larger quantity. The burger was relaunched in 2021 as the 3/9 Pound burger, humorously attempting to capitalize on the now-popular fractions misunderstanding story.

===Taubman Investment Co. subsidiary===
In 1982, A. Alfred Taubman purchased A&amp;W and placed it under Taubman Investment Co. Taubman only purchased the restaurant company and not A&amp;W Beverages. The chain dropped to fewer than 500 locations in the mid-1980s. A freeze on issuing franchises was put in place. Taubman wanted to restructure the chain by changing its &quot;outdated&quot; image. Franchisees were being neglected in the United Fruit phase. Taubman opted to withdraw agreements with 100 franchisees that were performing poorly and ousted 80% of its workforce. With this, the new management decided to split its fast-food restaurants into two units the conventional orange roof A&amp;W restaurants, which were still the majority, and A&amp;W Great Food Restaurants.

In 1985, the chain struggled in Singapore, losing its relevance to newer, larger chains and its dominance in the fried chicken area to KFC. The chain was about to amp up its operations in the Asian region, with a possible launch in Hong Kong as well as three new restaurants in Thailand.

On April 21, 1985, its first restaurant opened in Indonesia, in the Melawai area of South Jakarta, its capital. Currently, Indonesia is the chain&#x27;s largest international market, which as of February 2023 claimed 243 restaurants in 30 cities. A restaurant in Ximending, Taiwan opened on February 22, 1986. Its two units in Kuwait were closed in 1988 owing to security concerns.

On March 6, 1988, the first conventional A&amp;W outlet opened in the Philippines at Fiesta Carnival in Cubao, followed by a second at Gift Gate Center on November 26. The second restaurant&#x27;s reputation was damaged by a fire of unknown origin that broke out in May 1990. Nonetheless, the chain expanded with new outlets and products by the end of 1990. The Philippine chain was the first A&amp;W to introduce chicken nuggets, a product that even the American operations wanted from there. The chain also sponsored a team in the Philippine Basketball League, which they withdrew in 1992.

====A&amp;W Great Food Restaurants====

A new format concept, A&amp;W Great Food Restaurants, was developed. Ten corporate-owned locations were opened to test the concept: a sit-down, upscale, family-theme restaurant with a large salad bar and homemade ice cream. The first such branch opened in 1978 (1979, according to some sources) at the Lake Forest Shopping Mall in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Emphasis in these restaurants was made on low-calorie foods that covered almost the entirety of the foods found in the fast-food spectrum, except pizza. By 1986, there were plans to have 250 to 300 locations within ten years.
In 1987, the company was headquartered in Livonia, Michigan, and Mulder became CEO and president. The freeze was lifted, and a push occurred in 1986, adding 60 franchise units. In 1989, A&amp;W made an agreement with Minnesota-based Carousel Snack Bars to convert that chain&#x27;s 200 stores (mostly kiosks in shopping malls) to A&amp;W Hot Dogs &amp; More. Some A&amp;W Hot Dogs &amp; More are still operating. In the same year, A&amp;W bought the Burger City chain, converting its nine drive-thru kiosks to A&amp;W units.

George E. Michel, who had worked with the Canadian chain for twenty years, was appointed president of the American A&amp;W Restaurants in January 1991, becoming CEO in January 1992.

===Yorkshire Global Restaurants subsidiary===
In 1995, Taubman sold A&amp;W to Sidney Feltenstein. A&amp;W merged with Long John Silver&#x27;s to form Yorkshire Global Restaurants based in Lexington, Kentucky. In 2000, Yorkshire agreed to test multi-branded locations with Tricon Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Yorkshire-Tricon multi-branding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&amp;Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver&#x27;s, and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver&#x27;s and was considered successful by the companies.

An agreement was signed in 1996 with Walmart to provide restaurants in seven locations. The menu would add items depending on the region, with the rest being its standard fare. In 1997, A&amp;W acquired Carousel Snack Bars, including its 175 units in malls. The chain relocated its corporate headquarters to Farmington Hills on March 30, 1998. As part of a $80 million expansion plan, there were plans to open 500 restaurants in two years and close 100 outdated restaurants.
A&amp;W entered the mainland Chinese market in 1996, the franchisee for the country being Aidewei, and had eight restaurants in Beijing. Later, due to arrears of franchise fees since 2000, Adway lost the A&amp;W trademark in 2002. The eight restaurants weren&#x27;t operating well and were plagued by mismanagement. An outlet in Yansha with 140 seats in a crowded, strategic location turned out to have limited business, while the restaurant in Anzhen had few customers. Following the buyout of the parent chain by Yum! Brands in 2002, it was announced in March 2003 that negotiations with Adway had broken down, leading to the franchisee&#x27;s bankruptcy that same year. The restaurants closed successively from October 2002 to September 2003. The &quot;father of American fast food,&quot; as dubbed by the Chinese press, didn&#x27;t convince the local culture and tastes, especially with the rise of local fast food.

In 1997 a small A&amp;W restaurant opened in Festivalgate in Osaka, offering standard A&amp;W fare. The restaurant closed in 1999.

The first co-branded A&amp;W restaurant, tied with Mexican food chain Amigos, opened in Lincoln in 1997. The restaurant in Lodi took part in a world record for the largest root beer float of 2562.5 gallons on June 19, 1999, the eve of the eightieth anniversary of the chain. That same year, the chain attempted to enter the Korean market by finding local partners, aiming to grow in the Korean market in the first half of 2000. The plan was ultimately shelved.

In December 2000, A&amp;W announced new openings in less conventional locations, such as casinos, airports, gas stations, convention centers and convenience stores, for 2001, as part of its growth plans. At the time, the chain had more than 1,000 locations in 47 states and over 200 international locations in 14 countries. The chain around the time emphasized its aesthetics on &quot;contemporized nostalgia&quot;. It also saw a success in co-branded restaurants, following the success of a trial in Butte in 1998, which, owing to its success, in the spring of 2000 led to the announcement of the opening of 300 joint KFC-A&amp;W restaurants by 2005.

===Yum! Brands subsidiary===

In March 2002, Yorkshire merged with Tricon Global Restaurants to form Yum! Brands. Subsequently, in January 2003, Yum! announced that A&amp;W and Long John Silver&#x27;s would move their operational base from Lexington to Louisville, as operating the chains from Lexington was considered &quot;impractical and cost-inefficient&quot;, preferring to operate all of its chains from Louisville. Under Yum&#x27;s management, A&amp;W added franchises with a nostalgic look and modern technology. They have a carhop design with drive-thrus, and some have picnic tables. The chain didn&#x27;t seek to compete against McDonald&#x27;s, instead preferring to carve up its own niche. 2004 saw the return of the Papa Burger brand at a restaurant in Dayton - the Burger Family brand originally retired in the United States in the 1980s, being replaced by the Deluxe Burgers - and was the only name of the old line that was reinstated, with the other burgers having new names.

In September 2001 the Singapore branch was taken over by KUB, who also oversaw the restaurants in Malaysia. At the time of takeover, it had twelve restaurants, but by November 2002, the number had dwindled to eight. Its restaurants had already been downgraded: the Ang Mo Kio restaurant shut down, the Tampines restaurant refused to repair its air conditioning systems, and cable TV was switched off in all outlets. Food sales had decreased by about 5-12%. The chain quit the Philippine market in 2004 owing to several factors: lack of interest in its standard fare, lack of interest among locals, expensive cost and a general sense of unfamiliarity with local palates. The chain failed to adapt to local tastes and quietly shut down in the summer of 2004.
The chain attempted to enter large European markets thanks to joints with KFC. In Germany the first non-military A&amp;W restaurant opened in Garbsen near Hanover on May 27, 2003 followed by a second in Cologne in July. A third in Berlin was scheduled for early September.

A&amp;W opened its first outlet in Bangladesh on December 15, 2004. The outlet reportedly closed in 2024. Indonesia hit a record milestone, as the hundredth restaurant opened in Bintaro Utama on October 20, 2004. By the end of 2004, all A&amp;W restaurants in the Philippines were closed.

Most A&amp;W stores that opened in the U.S. during Yum!&#x27;s ownership were co-branded with another of Yum!&#x27;s chains—Long John Silver&#x27;s, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, or KFC.

In 2009, its operations in Southeast Asia were in a mixed situation. Operations in Indonesia and Bangladesh were thriving, while the restaurants in Thailand and Malaysia were facing uncertainties. The Malaysian franchisee KUB planned to increase the number of restaurants to 60, up from 37 in 2012, despite net losses of $1.5 million.

===A Great American Brand LLC===


In January 2011, Yum! Brands announced its intention to sell A&amp;W along with Long John Silver&#x27;s. Citing poor sales for both divisions and overshadowing by its other chains, Yum! planned to focus on international expansion for its remaining brands, with particular emphasis on growth in China. In September 2011, Yum! announced that it would sell the chain to A Great American Brand, a consortium of various A&amp;W franchisees in the United States and overseas. The sale was finalized on December 19, 2011, under the leadership of returning CEO Kevin M. Bazner. Administration of A Great American Brand was divided between the national A&amp;W franchisee association, the largest overseas franchisee and Bazner. With the purchase, A&amp;W relocated its headquarters back to Lexington, employing a staff of 30 in late 2011, aiming to double to 60 within a five-year period while setting a growth target after that. Potential targets for growth were going to be small towns, as well as non-conventional locations, such as shopping malls, airports and universities. The chain had 1,200 restaurants at the time, 850 of which were in the US, with the remaining primarily in Asia. The chain, instead of competing heavily against larger chains, continued to rely on its core strength, smaller cities and towns of the USA.

In early 2013, A&amp;W introduced its first new product in several years: a six-ounce version of its soft-serve blended dessert treat. Mini Polar Swirls were the first product to be launched on Vine. The following summer, 250 of A&amp;W&#x27;s restaurants began hand-breading their chicken tenders, moving towards higher-quality menu items and expanding their chicken category. In April 2014, the Hand-Breaded Chicken Tender Texas Toast Sandwich was added to the menu as a limited-time offering, along with a campaign to create the world&#x27;s longest branded hashtag. In June 2014, A&amp;W launched two new flavors of its Polar Swirl dessert treat: Sour Patch Kids and Nutter Butter.
In October 2013, A&amp;W opened its first new concept restaurant, A&amp;W Burgers Chicken Floats. The new concept focuses on fresh made-to-order food and heavily emphasizes customer service. The menu features burgers made with fresh beef and a choice of toppings, hand-breaded chicken tenders, all-beef hot dogs, and several sides. The new management gave A&amp;W a significant boost in the number of locations, with 2017 scheduled to have more openings than closures.

For 2018, A&amp;W projected an increase in its franchising operations and opening new restaurants.

In April 2019, A&amp;W returned to Singapore after a 16-year absence, its first location being at Jewel Changi Airport.

In June 2019, The A&amp;W chain started moving its headquarters to the University of Kentucky Coldstream Research Campus in 2019.

A&amp;W announced in March 2022 that it was going to withdraw from the Thai market due to economic losses. The restaurants shut down on March 20.

There are nearly 1,000 A&amp;W Restaurants worldwide that are owned or franchised through A Great American Brand, with approximately 600 of these restaurants located in the U.S.

A&amp;W rebounded its profits in the first half of 2024, emphasis on its growth is given mainly to single-brand restaurants, as well as restaurants in less conventional locations. In November 2024, the chain announced its entrance to the Milwaukee and Madison markets in Wisconsin.

==Operations==
A&amp;W is the only major fast-food chain in the United States to be owned entirely by franchisees since the 2011 sale from Yum! Brands to A Great American Brand, LLC., which is mostly under the control of the National A&amp;W Franchisee Association (NAWFA). The current owners rely heavily on single-brand restaurants, in contrast to combined, co-branded restaurants, which came from prior administrations. As of December 2021, there were 900 restaurants in the US and Asia. In the United States alone, the states with the most restaurants are California, followed by Wisconsin and Michigan. As of year-end 2023, A&amp;W has 455 franchised restaurants in the US market alone. The number of co-branded locations has been on the decline with 243 such units. As of January 2025, A&amp;W has made it to the Franchise 500 list for six consecutive years. The number of restaurants in the United States and in Asia is almost equiparable, with the chain steadily decreasing its number of units in the United States and increasing elsewhere, a trend that has been following since 2015.

==Advertising==
A&amp;W doesn&#x27;t do national advertising; the primary factor for such being the lack of restaurants in certain parts of the United States. Its first attempt at doing a national television commercial was on June 16, 1969, when it booked for a slot on NBC&#x27;s Monday Night at the Movies to advertise take-home gallons of root beer.

In 1976, A&amp;W Restaurants participated in the Easter Seals Telethon, where money from large root beer mugs was collected by the local restaurant on behalf of the TV station broadcasting the telethon in the area.

In January 2013, A&amp;W Restaurants appointed Lexington-based advertising agency Cornett Integrated Marketing as its new agency of record. The contract was renewed in January 2024.

In January 2019, ahead of its hundredth anniversary, A&amp;W removed the ampersand from its logo as part of a tongue-in-cheek campaign to bring back the ampersand to the alphabet as its 27th letter.

A&amp;W supports Disabled American Veterans and, since 2013, collects funds for it on National Root Beer Float Day, which is observed on August 6. Donation figures for 2019 were of a record $175,000. In the 2000s it was held in June and was known as National Float Day. Beginning in October 2020, in order to recoup economic losses from the closure of several of its restaurants, A&amp;W set up a series of quizzes on its website.

A&amp;W unveiled a new campaign in 2024, capitalizing on the ampersand of its logo and the tagline &quot;Burgers, Floats &amp; Then Some&quot;. Packaging was also changed accordingly.

==Mascots==

In the 1960s, a character named Chubby Chicken appeared on all Chubby burgers.

In 1963, A&amp;W introduced four choices of hamburgers and their corresponding Burger Family members: Papa Burger, Mama Burger, Teen Burger, and Baby Burger. Each burger had a wrapper featuring a cartoon image of the corresponding character.

The chain in the United States also used Dennis the Menace as a bespoke mascot in the 1960s, with special comics for the restaurants appearing mainly in print advertising.
Rooty, the Great American Root Bear, originated as a prototype mascot in kids&#x27; meals in the US, but it was in Canada in 1974 that it gained further recognition, as a counter to the Ronald McDonald character of McDonald&#x27;s and first appeared in the United States and in Asia shortly afterwards. However, the character&#x27;s introduction was almost aborted when marketing received focus group research results that reported a poor reaction to him . In reaction, the marketing director, acting on instinct about the appeal of the character, ordered the researcher to return to Toronto with the cover story that he never presented the report. The researcher complied, and Rooty was presented to the franchisees as is. Rooty proved a popular marketing success. Rooty&#x27;s adoption implied the phasing out of the Burger Family and the renaming of almost all of the burgers in the line outside of Canada.

Throughout the 1970s, &#x27;80s, and &#x27;90s, Rooty was the face of A&amp;W, both the bottled drinks and the restaurant chain, on television and print advertising. His presence all but disappeared in the late 1990s, but in 2011, under A Great American Brand&#x27;s ownership, Rooty came out of retirement. He has since been featured in print ads, on A&amp;W&#x27;s website, as the voice of their official Twitter account, and in a variety of YouTube and Vine videos. A bronze statue of the bear was erected at the lobby of the current headquarters. In 2013, Rooty became the first mascot to have an official LinkedIn profile, which was quickly shut down as Rooty was not considered &quot;real&quot; by the authorities at Linkedin.

The mascot made national headlines on January 24, 2023, when a parody tweet referencing the M&amp;M&#x27;s controversy was posted to its social media profiles, showing Rooty wearing pants, claiming that the mascot&#x27;s lack of pants was &quot;polarizing&quot;. Outrage started emerging from conservative sectors, including Fox News (the report also aired on sister network Fox Business), claiming it to be real. In a follow-up tweet, A&amp;W said that the announcement was a joke. Spokesperson Liz Bazner said that the initial post was &quot;purely in jest&quot; and that A&amp;W has no plans to change Rooty&#x27;s outfit.

In March 1998, the characters from the comic strip &quot;Blondie,&quot; including Blondie and Dagwood Bumstead, were licensed for use at A&amp;W franchises as part of an &quot;All American Food&quot; campaign. A tie-in burger was scheduled for July that year.

<text>A barbecue grill or barbeque grill (known as a barbecue or barbie in Australia and New Zealand) is a device that cooks food by applying heat from below. There are several varieties of grills, with most falling into one of three categories: gas-fueled, charcoal, or electric. There is debate over which method yields superior results.

==History in the Americas==
Grilling has existed in the Americas since pre-colonial times. The Arawak people of South America roasted meat on a wooden structure called a barbacoa in Spanish. For centuries, the term &quot;barbacoa&quot; referred to the wooden structure and not the act of grilling, but it was eventually modified to &quot;barbecue&quot;. It was also applied to the pit-style cooking techniques now frequently used in the southeastern United States. Barbecue was originally used to slow-cook hogs; however, different ways of preparing food led to regional variations. Over time, other foods were cooked in a similar fashion, with hamburgers and hot dogs being recent additions.
Edward G. Kingsford invented the modern charcoal briquette. Kingsford was a relative of Henry Ford who assigned him the task of establishing a Ford auto parts plant and sawmill in northern Michigan, a challenge that Kingsford embraced. The local community grew and was named Kingsford in his honor. Kingsford noticed that Ford&#x27;s Model T production lines were generating a large amount of wood scraps that were being discarded. He suggested to Ford that a charcoal manufacturing facility be established next to the assembly line to process and sell charcoal under the Ford name at Ford dealerships. Several years after Kingsford&#x27;s death, the chemical company was sold to local businessmen and renamed the Kingsford Chemical Company.

George Stephen created the iconic hemispherical grill design, jokingly called &quot;Sputnik&quot; by Stephen&#x27;s neighbors. Stephen, a welder, worked for Weber Brothers Metal Works, a metal fabrication shop primarily concerned with welding steel spheres together to make buoys. Stephen was tired of the wind blowing ash onto his food when he grilled so he took the lower half of a buoy, welded three steel legs onto it, and fabricated a shallower hemisphere for use as a lid. He took the results home and following some initial success, started the Weber-Stephen Products Company.

The gas grill was invented in the late 1930s by Don McGlaughlin, owner of the Chicago Combustion Corporation, known today as LazyMan. McGlaughlin invented the first built-in grill from the successful gas broiler called BROILBURGER. These first Lazy-Man grills were marketed as &quot;open-fire charcoal-type gas broilers&quot; which featured &quot;permanent coals&quot;, otherwise known as lava rock. In the 1950s, most residential households did not have a barbecue, so the term broiler was used for marketing purposes to commercial establishments. The gas open-broiler design was adapted into the first portable gas grill in 1954 by Chicago Combustion Corporation as the Model AP. McGlaughlin&#x27;s portable design was the first to feature the use of the 20-lb propane cylinders, which previously were exclusively used by plumbers as a fuel source.

==Types==

=== Electric ===

With an electric grill, the heating comes from an electric heating element. Neither coal nor briquettes are needed.

=== Gas ===
Gas-fueled grills typically use propane or butane (liquified petroleum gas) or natural gas as their fuel source, with the gas flame either cooking food directly or heating grilling elements which in turn radiate the heat necessary to cook food. Gas grills are available in sizes ranging from small, single steak grills up to large, industrial sized restaurant grills which are able to cook enough meat to feed a hundred or more people. According to Better Homes and Gardens magazine, &quot;gas grills are easier to start and generally heat up faster than charcoal grills.&quot;

Some gas grills can be switched between using liquified petroleum gas and natural gas fuel, although this requires physically changing key components including burners and regulator valves.

The majority of gas grills follow the cart grill design concept: the grill unit itself is attached to a wheeled frame that holds the fuel tank. The wheeled frame may also support side tables, storage compartments, and other features.

A recent trend in gas grills is for manufacturers to add an infrared radiant burner to the back of the grill enclosure. This radiant burner provides an even heat across the burner and is intended for use with a horizontal rotisserie. A meat item (whole chicken, beef roast, pork loin roast) is placed on a metal skewer that is rotated by an electric motor. Smaller cuts of meat can be grilled in this manner using a round metal basket that slips over the metal skewer.

Another type of gas grill gaining popularity is called a flattop grill. According to Hearth and Home magazine, flattop grills &quot;on which food cooks on a griddle-like surface and is not exposed to an open flame at all&quot; is an emerging trend in the outdoor grilling market.

A small metal &quot;smoker box&quot; containing wood chips may be used on a gas grill to give a smoky flavor to the grilled foods. Barbecue purists would argue that to get a true smoky flavor (and smoke ring) the user has to cook low and slow, indirectly and using wood or charcoal; gas grills are difficult to maintain at the low temperatures required (~225-250 °F), especially for extended periods. 

===Infrared===
Infrared grills work by igniting a gas fuel to heat a ceramic tile, causing it to emit infrared radiation by which the food is cooked. The thermal radiation is generated when heat from the movement of charged particles within atoms is converted to electromagnetic radiation in the infrared heat frequency range. Infrared grills allow users to more easily adjust cooking temperature than charcoal grills, and are usually able to reach higher temperatures than standard gas grills, making them popular for searing items quickly.

===Charcoal===

Charcoal grills use either charcoal briquettes or natural lump charcoal as their fuel source. When burned, the charcoal will transform into embers radiating the heat necessary to cook food.

There is contention among grilling enthusiasts on what type of charcoal is best for grilling. Users of charcoal briquettes emphasize the uniformity in size, burn rate, heat creation, and quality exemplified by briquettes. Users of all-natural lump charcoal emphasize its subtle smoky aromas, high heat production, and the lack of binders and fillers often present in briquettes.

There are many different charcoal grill configurations. Grills can be square, round, or rectangular, some have lids while others do not, and they may or may not have a venting system for heat control. The majority of charcoal grills, however, fall into the following categories:

====Brazier====

The simplest and most inexpensive of charcoal grills, the brazier grill is made of wire and sheet metal and composed of a cooking grid placed over a charcoal pan. Usually the grill is supported by legs attached to the charcoal pan. The brazier grill does not have a lid or venting system. Heat is adjusted by moving the cooking grid up or down over the charcoal pan. Even after George Stephen invented the kettle grill in the early 1950s, the brazier grill remained a dominant charcoal grill type for a number of years. Brazier grills are available at most discount department stores during the summer.

====Pellet grill====
Pellet technology is widely used in home heating in certain parts of North America. Softer woods including pine are often used for home heating. Pellets for home heating are not cooking-grade and should not be used in pellet grills.

====Square charcoal====
The square charcoal grill is a hybrid of the brazier and the kettle grill. It has a shallow pan like the brazier and normally a simple method of adjusting the heat, if any. However, it has a lid like a kettle grill and basic adjustable vents. The square charcoal grille is, as expected, priced between the brazier and kettle grill, with the most basic models priced around the same as the most expensive braziers and the most expensive models competing with basic kettle grills. These grills are available at discount stores and have largely displaced most larger braziers. Square charcoal grills almost exclusively have four legs with two wheels on the back so the grill can be tilted back using the handles for the lid to roll the grill. More expensive examples have baskets and shelves mounted on the grill.

====Shichirin (hibachi)====

The traditional Japanese hibachi is a heating device and not usually used for cooking. In English, however, &quot;hibachi&quot; often refers to small cooking grills typically made of aluminum or cast iron, with the latter generally being of a higher quality. Owing to their small size, hibachi grills are popular as a form of portable barbecue. They resemble traditional, Japanese, charcoal-heated cooking utensils called shichirin.

Alternatively, &quot;hibachi-style&quot; is often used in the U.S. as a term for Japanese teppanyaki cooking, in which gas-heated hotplates are integrated into tables around which many people (often multiple parties) can sit and eat at once. The chef performs the cooking in front of the diners, typically with theatrical flair—such as lighting a volcano-shaped stack of raw onion hoops on fire.

In its most common form, the hibachi is an inexpensive grill made of either sheet steel or cast iron and composed of a charcoal pan and two small, independent cooking grids. Like the brazier grill, heat is adjusted by moving the cooking grids up and down. Also like the brazier grill, the hibachi does not have a lid. Some hibachi designs have venting systems for heat control. The hibachi is a good grill choice for those who do not have much space for a larger grill, or those who wish to take their grill traveling. &quot;Binchō-tan&quot; is most suitable for fuel of shichirin.

====Kettle====
The kettle grill is considered the classic American grill design. The original and often-copied Weber kettle grill was invented in 1952 by George Stephen.

====Ceramic cooker====
The ceramic cooker design has been around for roughly 3,000 years. The shichirin, a Japanese grill traditionally of ceramic construction, has existed in its current form since the Edo period however more recent designs have been influenced by the mushikamado, a traditional Japanese cooking appliance, which gained recognition among Americans during World War II. Now, it is more commonly referred to as a kamado. The term &quot;Kamado&quot; is derived from the Japanese language and translates to &quot;stove&quot; or &quot;cooking range.&quot; The ceramic cooker is more versatile than the kettle grill as the ceramic chamber retains heat and moisture more efficiently. Ceramic cookers are equally adept at grilling, smoking, and barbecuing foods.

====Tandoor oven====

A tandoor is used for cooking certain types of Iranian, Indian and Pakistani food, such as tandoori chicken and naan. In a tandoor, the wood fire is kept in the bottom of the oven and the food to be cooked is put on long skewers and inserted into the oven from an opening on the top so the meat items are above the coals of the fire. This method of cooking involves both grilling and oven cooking as the meat item to be cooked sees both high direct infrared heat and the heat of the air in the oven. Tandoor ovens often operate at temperatures above and cook the meat items very quickly.

====Portable charcoal====
The portable charcoal grill normally falls into either the brazier or kettle grill category. Some are rectangular in shape. A portable charcoal grill is usually quite compact and has features that make it easier to transport, making it a popular grill for tailgating. Often the legs fold up and lock into place so the grill will fit into a car trunk more easily. Most portable charcoal grills have venting, legs, and lids, though some models do not have lids (making them, technically, braziers). There are also grills designed without venting to prevent ash fallout for use in locations which ash may damage ground surfaces. Some portable grills are designed to replicate the function of a larger more traditional grill/brazier and may include spit roasting as well as a hood and additional grill areas under the hood area.

==== Gravity-fed ====
Gravity-fed charcoal grills have a hopper that is filled with charcoal briquettes or lump charcoal; then a fire is lit at the bottom of the hopper. A digitally controlled fan is used to control the intensity and temperature of the fire burning. The heat and smoke is routed underneath the food to cook and smoke it.

===Commercial===
A commercial barbecue typically has a larger cooking capacity than traditional household grills, as well as featuring a variety of accessories for added versatility. End users of commercial barbecue grills include for-profit operations such as restaurants, caterers, food vendors and grilling operations at food fairs, golf tournaments and other charity events, as well as competition cookers. The category lends itself to originality, and many commercial barbecue grills feature designs unique to their respective manufacturer.
Commercial barbecue grills can be stationary or transportable. An example of a stationary grill is a built-in pit grill, for indoor or outdoor use. Construction materials include bricks, mortar, concrete, tile and cast iron. Most commercial barbecue grills, however, are mobile, allowing the operator to take the grill wherever the job is. Transportable commercial barbecue grills can be units with removable legs, grills that fold, and grills mounted entirely on trailers.

Trailer mounted commercial barbecue grills run the gamut from basic grill cook tops to pit barbecue grills and smokers, to specialized roasting units that cook whole pigs, chicken, ribs, corn and other vegetables.

==Parts==
Many gas grill components can be replaced with new parts, adding to the useful life of the grill. Though charcoal grills can sometimes require new cooking grids and charcoal grates, gas grills are much more complex, and require additional components such as burners, valves, and heat shields.

===Burners===
A gas grill burner is the central source of heat for cooking food. Gas grill burners are typically constructed of: stainless steel, aluminized steel, or cast iron, occasionally porcelain-coated.

Burners are hollow with gas inlet holes and outlet &#x27;ports&#x27;. For each inlet there is a separate control on the control panel of the grill. The most common type of gas grill burners are called &#x27;H&#x27; burners and resemble the capital letter &#x27;H&#x27; turned on its side. Another popular shape is oval. There are also &#x27;Figure 8&#x27;, &#x27;Bowtie&#x27; and &#x27;Bar&#x27; burners. Other grills have a separate burner for each control. These burners can be referred to as &#x27;Pipe&#x27;, &#x27;Tube&#x27;, or &#x27;Rail&#x27; burners. They are mostly straight since they are only required to heat one portion of the grill.

Gas is mixed with air in venturi tubes or simply &#x27;venturis&#x27;. Venturis can be permanently attached to the burner or removable. At the other end of the venturi is the gas valve, which is connected to the control knob on the front of the grill.

A metal screen covers the fresh air intake of each venturi to keep spiders from clogging the tube with their nests.

===Cooking grate===
Cooking grates, also known as cooking grids, are the surface on which the food is cooked in a grill. They are typically made of:

*Stainless steel - usually the most expensive and longest-lasting option, may carry a lifetime warranty
*Porcelain-coated cast iron - the next best option after stainless steel, usually thick and good for searing meat
*Porcelain-coated steel - will typically last as long as porcelain-coated cast iron, but not as good for searing
*Cast iron - more commonly used for charcoal grills, cast iron must be coated with cooking oil between uses to protect it from rusting
*Chrome-plated steel - usually the least expensive and shortest-lasting material

Cooking grates used over gas or charcoal barbecues will allow fat and oil to drop between the grill bars. This can cause the fat or oil to ignite in a &#x27;flare-up&#x27;, the flames from which can blacken or burn the food on the grate. In an attempt to combat this problem, some barbecues are fitted with plates, baffles or other means to deflect the dripping flammable fluids away from the burners.

===Rock grate===
Rock grates are placed directly above the burner and are designed to hold lava rock or ceramic briquettes. These materials serve a dual purpose - they protect the burner from drippings which can accelerate the deterioration of the burner, and they disperse the heat from the burner more evenly throughout the grill.

===Heat shield===
Heat shields are also known as burner shields, heat plates, heat tents, radiation shields, or heat angles. They serve the same purpose as a rock grate and rock, protecting the burner from corrosive meat drippings and dispersing heat. They are more common in newer grills. Heat shields are lighter, easier to replace and harbor less bacteria than rocks.

Like lava rock or ceramic briquettes, heat shields also vaporize the meat drippings and &#x27;infuse&#x27; the meat with more flavor.

===Valves===
Valves can wear out or become rusted and too difficult to operate requiring replacement. A valve is unlike a burner, a replacement valve usually must be an exact match to the original in order to fit properly. As a consequence, many grills are disposed of when valves fail due to a lack of available replacements.

If a valve seems to be moving properly, but no gas is getting to the burner, the most common cause for this is debris in the venturi. This impediment can be cleared by using a long flexible object.

===Cover===
A barbecue cover is a textile product specially designed to fit over a grill so as to protect it from outdoor elements such as sun, wind, rain and snow, and outdoor contaminants such as dust, pollution, and bird droppings.

Barbecue covers are commonly made with a vinyl outer shell and a heat-resistant inner lining, as well as adjustable straps to secure the cover in windy conditions. The cover may have a polyester surface, often with polyurethane coating on the outer surface, with polyvinyl chloride liner.

<text>An Internet forum, or message board, is an online discussion site where people can hold conversations in the form of posted messages. They differ from chat rooms in that messages are often longer than one line of text, and are at least temporarily archived. Also, depending on the access level of a user or the forum set-up, a posted message might need to be approved by a moderator before it becomes publicly visible.

Forums have a specific set of jargon associated with them; for example, a single conversation is called a &quot;thread&quot;, or &quot;topic&quot;. The name comes from the forums of Ancient Rome.

A discussion forum is hierarchical or 
tree-like in structure; a forum can contain a number of subforums, each of which may have several topics. Within a forum&#x27;s topic, each new discussion started is called a thread and can be replied to by as many people as they so wish.

Depending on the forum&#x27;s settings, users can be anonymous or have to register with the forum and then subsequently log in to post messages. On most forums, users do not have to log in to read existing messages.

==History==
The modern forum originated from bulletin boards and so-called computer conferencing systems, which are a technological evolution of the dial-up bulletin board system (BBS). From a technological standpoint, &quot;forums&quot; or &quot;boards&quot; are web applications that manage user-generated content. 

Early Internet forums could be described as a web version of an electronic mailing list or newsgroup (such as those that exist on Usenet), allowing people to post messages and comment on other messages. Later developments emulated the different newsgroups or individual lists, providing more than one forum dedicated to a particular topic.

Internet forums are prevalent in several developed countries. Japan posts the most, with over two million per day on their largest forum, 2channel. China also has millions of posts on forums such as Tianya Club.

Some of the first forum systems were the Planet-Forum system, developed at the beginning of the 1970s; the EIES system, first operational in 1976; and the KOM system, first operational in 1977.

One of the first forum sites (which is still active today) is Delphi Forums, once called Delphi. The service, with four million members, dates to 1983.

Forums perform a function similar to that of dial-up bulletin board systems and Usenet networks that were first created in the late 1970s. Early web-based forums date back as far as 1994, with the WIT project from the W3 Consortium, and starting at this time, many alternatives were created. A sense of virtual community often develops around forums that have regular users. Technology, video games, sports, music, fashion, religion, and politics are popular areas for forum themes, but there are forums for a huge number of topics. Internet slang and image macros popular across the Internet are abundant and widely used in Internet forums.

Forum software packages are widely available on the Internet and are written in a variety of programming languages, such as PHP, Perl, Java, and ASP. The configuration and records of posts can be stored in text files or in a database. Each package offers different features, from the most basic, providing text-only postings, to more advanced packages, offering multimedia support and formatting code (usually known as BBCode). Many packages can be integrated easily into an existing website to allow visitors to post comments on articles.

Several other web applications, such as blog software, also incorporate forum features. WordPress comments at the bottom of a blog post allow for a single-threaded discussion of any given blog post. Slashcode, on the other hand, is far more complicated, allowing fully threaded discussions and incorporating a robust moderation and meta-moderation system as well as many of the profile features available to forum users.

Some stand-alone threads on forums have reached fame and notability, such as the &quot;I am lonely will anyone speak to me&quot; thread on MovieCodec.com&#x27;s forums, which was described as the &quot;web&#x27;s top hangout for lonely folk&quot; by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, or Stevan Harnad&#x27;s Subversive Proposal.

==Structure==
A forum consists of a tree-like directory structure. The top end is &quot;Categories&quot;. A forum can be divided into categories for the relevant discussions. Under the categories are sub-forums, and these sub-forums can further have more sub-forums. The &quot;topics&quot; (commonly called &quot;threads&quot;) come under the lowest level of sub-forums, and these are the places under which members can start their discussions or &quot;posts&quot;. Logically, forums are organized into a finite set of generic topics (usually with one main topic), driven and updated by a group known as &quot;members&quot;, and governed by a group known as &quot;moderators&quot;. It can also have a graph structure.
All message boards will use one of three possible display formats.
Each of the three basic message board display formats: Non-Threaded/Semi-Threaded/Fully Threaded,
has its own advantages and disadvantages. If messages are not related to one another
at all, a Non-Threaded format is best. If a user has a message topic and multiple
replies to that message topic, a semi-threaded format is best. If a user has a message
topic and replies to that message topic and responds to replies, then a fully threaded
format is best.

===User groups===
Internally, Western-style forums organize visitors and logged-in members into user groups. Privileges and rights are given based on these groups. A user of the forum can automatically be promoted to a more privileged user group based on criteria set by the administrator. A person viewing a closed thread as a &quot;member&quot; will see a box saying he does not have the right to submit messages there, but a &quot;moderator&quot; will likely see the same box, granting him access to more than just posting messages.

An unregistered user of the site is commonly known as a &quot;guest&quot; or &quot;visitor&quot;. Guests are typically granted access to all functions that do not require database alterations or breach privacy. A guest can usually view the contents of the forum or use such features as &quot;read marking&quot;, but occasionally an administrator will disallow visitors to read their forum as an incentive to become a registered member. A person who is a very frequent visitor of the forum, a section, or even a thread is referred to as a lurker, and the habit is referred to as &quot;lurking&quot;. Registered members often will refer to themselves as &quot;lurking&quot; in a particular location, which is to say they have no intention of participating in that section but enjoy reading the contributions to it.

====Moderators====
The &quot;moderators&quot; (short singular form: &quot;mod&quot;) are users (or employees) of the forum who are granted access to the posts and threads of all members for the purpose of &quot;moderating discussion&quot; (similar to arbitration) and also keeping the forum clean (neutralizing spam and spambots, etc.). Moderators also answer users&#x27; concerns about the forum and general questions, as well as respond to specific complaints. Common privileges of moderators include: deleting, merging, moving, and splitting of posts and threads, locking, renaming, and stickying of threads; banning, unbanning, suspending, unsuspending, warning the members; or adding, editing, and removing the polls of threads. &quot;Junior modding&quot;, &quot;backseat modding&quot;, or &quot;forum copping&quot; can refer negatively to the behavior of ordinary users who take a moderator-like tone in criticizing other members.

Essentially, it is the duty of the moderator to manage the day-to-day affairs of a forum or board as it applies to the stream of user contributions and interactions. The relative effectiveness of this user management directly impacts the quality of a forum in general, its appeal, and its usefulness as a community of interrelated users.

Moderators act as unpaid volunteers on many websites, which has sparked controversies and community tensions. On Reddit, some moderators have prominently expressed dissatisfaction with their unpaid labor being underappreciated, while other site users have accused moderators of abusing special access privileges to act as a &quot;cabal&quot; of &quot;petty tyrants&quot;. On 4chan, moderators are subject to notable levels of mockery and contempt. There, they are often referred to as janitors (or, more pejoratively, &quot;jannies&quot;) given their job, which is tantamount to cleaning up the imageboards&#x27; infamous shitposting.

====Administrators====
The &quot;administrators&quot; (short form: &quot;admin&quot;) manage the technical details required for running the site. As such, they have the authority to appoint and revoke members as moderators, manage the rules, create sections and sub-sections, as well as perform any database operations (database backup, etc.). Administrators often also act as moderators. Administrators may also make forum-wide announcements or change the appearance (known as the skin) of a forum. There are also many forums where administrators share their knowledge.

===Post===
A &quot;post&quot; is a user-submitted message enclosed in a block containing the user&#x27;s details and the date and time it was submitted. Members are usually allowed to edit or delete their own posts. Posts are contained in threads, where they appear as blocks one after another. The first post starts the thread; this may be called the TS (thread starter) or OP (original post). Posts that follow in the thread are meant to continue discussion about that post or respond to other replies; it is not uncommon for discussions to be derailed.

On Western forums, the classic way to show a member&#x27;s own details (such as name and avatar) has been on the left side of the post, in a narrow column of fixed width, with the post controls located on the right, at the bottom of the main body, above the signature block. In more recent forum software implementations, the Asian style of displaying the members&#x27; details above the post has been copied.

Posts have an internal limit, usually measured in characters. Often, one is required to have a message with a minimum length of 10 characters. There is always an upper limit, but it is rarely reached – most boards have it at either 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, or 50,000 characters.

Most forums keep track of a user&#x27;s postcount. The postcount is a measurement of how many posts a certain user has made. Users with higher postcounts are often considered more reputable than users with lower postcounts, but not always. For instance, some forums have disabled postcounts with the hopes that doing so will emphasize the quality of information over quantity.

===Thread===

A &quot;thread&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;topic&quot;) is a collection of posts, usually displayed from oldest to latest, although this is typically configurable: Options for newest to oldest and for a threaded view (a tree-like view applying logical reply structure before chronological order) can be available. A thread is defined by a title, an additional description that may summarize the intended discussion, and an opening or original post (common abbreviation OP, which can also be used to refer to the original poster), which opens whatever dialogue or makes whatever announcement the poster wishes. A thread can contain any number of posts, including multiple posts from the same members, even if they are one after the other.

====Bumping====

A thread is contained in a forum and may have an associated date that is taken as the date of the last post (options to order threads by other criteria are generally available). When a member posts in a thread, it will jump to the top since it is the latest updated thread. Similarly, other threads will jump in front of it when they receive posts. When a member posts in a thread for no reason but to have it go to the top, it is referred to as a &quot;bump&quot; or &quot;bumping&quot;. It has been suggested that &quot;bump&quot; is an acronym of &quot;bring up my post&quot;; however, this is almost certainly a backronym, and the usage is entirely consistent with the verb &quot;bump&quot; which means &quot;to knock to a new position&quot;.

On some messageboards, users can choose to &quot;sage&quot; (, though often ) a post if they wish to make a post but not &quot;bump&quot; it. The word &quot;sage&quot; derives from the 2channel terminology 下げる &quot;sageru&quot;, meaning &quot;to lower&quot;.

====Stickying====
Threads that are important but rarely receive posts are &quot;stickied&quot; (or, in some software, &quot;pinned&quot;). A &quot;sticky thread&quot; will always appear in front of normal threads, often in its own section. A &quot;threaded discussion group&quot; is simply any group of individuals who use a forum for threaded, or asynchronous, discussion purposes. The group may or may not be the only users of the forum.

A thread&#x27;s popularity is measured on forums in reply (total posts minus one, the opening post, in most default forum settings) counts. Some forums also track page views. Threads meeting a set number of posts or a set number of views may receive a designation such as &quot;hot thread&quot; and be displayed with a different icon compared to other threads. This icon may stand out more to emphasize the thread. If the forum&#x27;s users have lost interest in a particular thread, it becomes a &quot;dead thread&quot;.


==Discussion==

Forums prefer the premise of open and free discussion and often adopt de facto standards. The most common topics on forums include questions, comparisons, polls of opinion, and debates. It is not uncommon for nonsense or unsocial behavior to sprout as people lose their temper, especially if the topic is controversial. Poor understanding of the differences in values among the participants is a common problem on forums. Because replies to a topic are often worded to target someone&#x27;s point of view, discussion will usually go slightly off in several directions as people question each other&#x27;s validity, sources, and so on. Circular discussion and ambiguity in replies can extend for several tens of posts in a thread, eventually ending when everyone gives up or attention spans waver and a more interesting subject takes over. It is not uncommon for debate to end in &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks.

=== Liabilities of owners and moderators ===
Several lawsuits have been brought against the forums and moderators, claiming libel and damage. A recent case is the Scubaboard lawsuit, where a business in the Maldives filed a suit against Scubaboard for libel and defamation in January 2010.

For the most part, though, forum owners and moderators in the United States are protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which states that &quot;[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider&quot;.

In 2019, Facebook was faced with a class action lawsuit set forth by moderators diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. It was settled for $52 million the following year.

==Common features==
By default, to be an Internet forum, the web application needs the ability to submit threads and replies. Typically, threads are in a newer to older view, and replies are in an older to newer view.

===Tripcodes and capcodes===
Most imageboards and 2channel-style discussion boards allow (and encourage) anonymous posting and use a system of tripcodes instead of registration. A tripcode is the hashed result of a password that allows one&#x27;s identity to be recognized without storing any data about the user.

In a tripcode system, a secret password is added to the user&#x27;s name following a separator character (often a number sign). This password, or tripcode, is hashed into a special key, or trip, distinguishable from the name by HTML styles. Tripcodes cannot be faked, but on some types of forum software, they are insecure and can be guessed. On other types, they can be brute-forced with software designed to search for tripcodes, such as Tripcode Explorer.

Moderators and administrators will frequently assign themselves capcodes or tripcodes where the guessable trip is replaced with a special notice (such as &quot;# Administrator&quot;) or cap.

===Personal message===

A &quot;personal&quot; or &quot;private message&quot;, or PM for short, is a message sent in private from a member to one or more other members. The ability to send so-called blind carbon copies (BCC) is sometimes available. When sending a BCC, the users to whom the message is sent directly will not be aware of the recipients of the BCC or even if one was sent in the first place.

Private messages are generally used for personal conversations. They can also be used with tripcodes—a message is addressed to a public trip and can be picked up by typing in the tripcode.

===Attachment===
An attachment can be almost any file. When someone attaches a file to a person&#x27;s post, they are uploading that particular file to the forum&#x27;s server. Forums usually have very strict limits on what can be attached and what cannot (among which is the size of the files in question). Attachments can be part of a thread, a social group, etc.

===BBCode and HTML===

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is sometimes allowed, but usually its use is discouraged or, when allowed, extensively filtered. Modern bulletin board systems often have it disabled altogether or allow only administrators to use it, as allowing it at any normal user level is considered a security risk due to the high rate of XSS vulnerabilities. When HTML is disabled, Bulletin Board Code (BBCode) is the most common preferred alternative. BBCode usually consists of a tag, similar to HTML, but instead of codice_1 and codice_2, the tagname is enclosed within square brackets (meaning: codice_3 and codice_4). Commonly, codice_5 is used for italic type, codice_6 is used for bold, codice_7 for underline, codice_8 for color, and codice_9 for lists, as well as codice_10 for images and codice_11 for links.

The following example BBCode: codice_12. When the post is viewed, the code is rendered to HTML and will appear as: This is &quot;clever&quot; text.

Many forum packages offer a way to create Custom BBCodes, or BBcodes that are not built into the package, where the administrator of the board can create complex BBCodes to allow the use of JavaScript or iframe functions in posts, for example, embedding a YouTube or Google Video complete with viewer directly into a post.

===Emoticon===

An emoticon, or &quot;smiley&quot;, is a symbol or combination of symbols used to convey emotional content in written or message form. Forums implement a system through which some of the text representations of emoticons (e.g., codice_13, codice_14) are rendered as a small image. Depending on what part of the world the forum&#x27;s topic originates from (since most forums are international), smilies can be replaced by other forms of similar graphics; an example would be kaoani (e.g., codice_15, codice_16), or even text between special symbols (e.g., :blink:, :idea:).

===Poll===
Most forums implement an opinion poll system for threads. Most implementations allow for single-choice or multi-choice (sometimes limited to a certain number) when selecting options, as well as private or public display of voters. Polls can be set to expire after a certain date or, in some cases, after a number of days from their creation. Members vote in a poll, and a statistic is displayed graphically.

===Other features===
An &quot;ignore list&quot; allows members to hide posts of other members that they do not want to see or have a problem with. In most implementations, they are referred to as &quot;foe list&quot; or &quot;ignore list&quot;. The posts are usually not hidden but minimized, with only a small bar indicating a post from the user on the &quot;ignore list&quot; is there. Almost all Internet forums include a &quot;member list&quot;, which allows the display of all forum members with an integrated search feature. Some forums will not list members with zero posts, even if they have activated their accounts.

Many forums allow users to give themselves an &quot;avatar&quot;. An avatar is an image that appears beside all of a user&#x27;s posts in order to make the user more recognizable. The user may upload the image to the forum database or provide a link to an image on a separate website. Each forum has limits on the height, width, and data size of avatars that may be used; if the user tries to use an avatar that is too big, it may be scaled down or rejected.

Similarly, most forums allow users to define a &quot;signature&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;sig&quot;), which is a block of text, possibly with BBCode, that appears at the bottom of all of the user&#x27;s posts. There is a character limit on signatures, though it may be so high that it is rarely hit. Often, the forum&#x27;s moderators impose manual rules on signatures to prevent them from being obnoxious (for example, being extremely long or having flashing images) and issue warnings or bans to users who break these rules. Like avatars, signatures may improve the recognizability of a poster. They may also allow the user to attach information to all of their posts, such as proclaiming support for a cause, noting facts about themselves, or quoting humorous things that have previously been said on the forum.

A &quot;subscription&quot; is a form of automated notification integrated into the software of most forums. It usually notifies the member either by email or on the site when the member returns. The option to subscribe is available for every thread while logged in. Subscriptions work with &quot;read marking&quot;, namely the property of &quot;unread&quot;, which is given to the content never served to the user by the software.

Recent developments in some popular implementations of forum software have brought &quot;social network features and functionality&quot;. Such features include personal galleries and pages, as well as social networks like chat systems.
Most forum software is now fully customizable, with &quot;hacks&quot; or &quot;modifications&quot; readily available to customize a person&#x27;s forum to theirs and their members&#x27; needs.

Often forums use &quot;cookies&quot;, or information about the user&#x27;s behavior on the site sent to a user&#x27;s browser and used upon re-entry into the site. This is done to facilitate automatic login and to show a user whether a thread or forum has received new posts since his or her last visit. These may be disabled or cleared at any time.

==Rules and policies==
Forums are governed by a set of individuals, collectively referred to as &quot;staff&quot;, made up of &quot;administrators&quot; and &quot;moderators&quot;, which are responsible for the forums&#x27; conception, technical maintenance, and policies (creation and enforcing). Most forums have a list of rules detailing the wishes, aim, and guidelines of the forums&#x27; creators. There is usually also a FAQ section containing basic information for new members and people not yet familiar with the use and principles of a forum (generally tailored for specific forum software).

Rules on forums usually apply to the entire user body and often have preset exceptions, most commonly designating a section as an exception. For example, in an IT forum any discussion regarding anything but computer programming languages may be against the rules, with the exception of a &quot;general chat&quot; section.

Forum rules are maintained and enforced by the moderation team, but users are allowed to help out via what is known as a report system. Most Western forum platforms automatically provide such a system. It consists of a small function applicable to each post (including one&#x27;s own). Using it will notify all currently available moderators of its location, and subsequent action or judgment can be carried out immediately, which is particularly desirable in large or very developed boards. Generally, moderators encourage members to also use the &quot;private message&quot; system if they wish to report behavior. Moderators will generally frown upon attempts of moderation by non-moderators, especially when the would-be moderators do not even issue a report. Messages from non-moderators acting as moderators generally declare a post as against the rules or predict punishment. While not harmful, statements that attempt to enforce the rules are discouraged.

When rules are broken several steps are commonly taken. First, a warning is usually given; this is commonly in the form of a &quot;private message&quot; but recent development has made it possible for it to be integrated into the software. Subsequent to this, if the act is ignored and warnings do not work, the member is – usually – first exiled from the forum for a number of days. Denying someone access to the site is called a &quot;ban&quot;. Bans can mean the person can no longer log in or even view the site anymore. If the offender, after the warning sentence, repeats the offense, another ban is given, usually this time a longer one. Continuous harassment of the site eventually leads to a permanent ban. In most cases, this means simply that the account is locked. In extreme cases where the offender – after being permanently banned – creates another account and continues to harass the site, administrators will apply an IP address ban or block (this can also be applied at the server level): If the IP address is static, the machine of the offender is prevented from accessing the site. In some extreme circumstances, IP address range bans or country bans can be applied; this is usually for political, licensing, or other reasons. See also: Block (Internet), IP address blocking, and Internet censorship.

Offending content is usually deleted. Sometimes if the topic is considered the source of the problem, it is &quot;locked&quot;; often a poster may request a topic expected to draw problems to be locked as well, although the moderators decide whether to grant it. In a &quot;locked thread&quot;, members cannot post anymore. In cases where the topic is considered a breach of rules it – with all of its posts – may be deleted.

===Troll===

Forum &quot;trolls&quot; are users that repeatedly and deliberately breach the netiquette of an established online community, posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages to bait or excite users into responding or to test the forum rules and policies, and with that the patience of the forum staff. Their provocative behavior may potentially start flame wars (see below) or other disturbances. Responding to a troll&#x27;s provocations is commonly known as &#x27;feeding the troll&#x27; and is generally discouraged, as it can encourage their disruptive behavior.

===Sock puppet===

The term sock puppet refers to multiple pseudonyms in use by the same person on a particular message board or forum. The analogy of a sock puppet is of a puppeteer holding up both hands and supplying dialogue to both puppets simultaneously. A typical use of a sockpuppet account is to agree with or debate another sockpuppet account belonging to the same person, for the purposes of reinforcing the puppeteer&#x27;s position in an argument. Sock puppets are usually found when an IP address check is done on the accounts in forums.

===Spamming===

Forum spamming is a breach of netiquette where users repeat the same word or phrase over and over, but differs from multiple posting in that spamming is usually a willful act that sometimes has malicious intent. This is a common trolling technique. It can also be traditional spam, unpaid advertisements that are in breach of the forum&#x27;s rules. Spammers utilize a number of illicit techniques to post their spam, including the use of botnets.

Some forums consider concise, comment-oriented posts spam, for example &quot;Thank you&quot;, &quot;Cool&quot; or &quot;I love it&quot;.

===Double posting===

One common &quot;faux pas&quot; on Internet forums is to post the same message twice. Users sometimes post versions of a message that are only slightly different, especially in forums where they are not allowed to edit their earlier posts. Multiple posting instead of editing prior posts can artificially inflate a user&#x27;s post count. Multiple posting can be unintentional; a user&#x27;s browser might display an error message even though the post has been transmitted or a user of a slow forum might become impatient and repeatedly hit the submit button. An offline editor may post the same message twice. Multiple posting can also be used as a method of trolling or spreading forum spam. A user may also send the same post to several forums, which is termed crossposting. The term derives from Usenet, where crossposting was an accepted practice but causes problems in web forums, which lack the ability to link such posts so replies in one forum are not visible to people reading the post in other forums.

===Necroposting===
A is a message that revives (as in necromancy) an arbitrarily old thread, causing it to appear above newer and more active threads. This practice is generally seen as a breach of netiquette on most forums. Because old threads are not usually locked from further posting, necroposting is common for newer users and in cases where the date of previous posts is not apparent.

===Word censor===

A word censoring system is commonly included in the forum software package. The system will pick up words in the body of the post or some other user-editable forum element (like user titles), and if they partially match a certain keyword (commonly no case sensitivity) they will be censored. The most common censoring is letter replacement with an asterisk character. For example, in the user title, it is deemed inappropriate for users to use words such as &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;moderator&quot;, &quot;leader&quot; and so on. If the censoring system is implemented, a title such as &quot;forum leader&quot; may be filtered to &quot;forum ******&quot;. Rude or vulgar words are common targets for the censoring system. But such auto-censors can make mistakes, for example censoring &quot;wristwatch&quot; to &quot;wris****ch&quot;, &quot;Scunthorpe&quot; to &quot;S****horpe or &quot;Essex&quot; to &quot;Es***&quot;.

===Flame wars===

When a thread—or in some cases, an entire forum—becomes unstable, the result is usually uncontrolled spam in the form of one-line complaints, image macros, or abuse of the report system. When the discussion becomes heated and sides do nothing more than complain and not accept each other&#x27;s differences in point of view, the discussion degenerates into what is called a &quot;flame war&quot;. To &quot;flame&quot; someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion. Likely candidates for flame wars are usually religion and socio-political topics, or topics that discuss pre-existing rivalries outside the forum (e.g., rivalry between games, console systems, car manufacturers, nationalities, etc.).

When a topic that has degenerated into a flame war is considered akin to that of the forum (be it a section or the entire board), spam and flames have a chance of spreading outside the topic and causing trouble, usually in the form of vandalism. Some forums (commonly game forums) have suffered from forum-wide flame wars almost immediately after their conception, because of a pre-existing &quot;flame war element&quot; in the online community. Many forums have created devoted areas strictly for discussion of potential flame war topics that are moderated like normal.

===Registration or anonymity===
Many Internet forums require registration to post. Registered users of the site are referred to as &quot;members&quot; and are allowed to submit or send electronic messages through the web application. The process of registration involves verification of one&#x27;s age (typically age 13 and over is required so as to meet COPPA requirements of American forum software) followed by a declaration of the terms of service (other documents may also be present) and a request for agreement to said terms. Subsequently, if all goes well, the candidate is presented with a web form to fill requesting at the very least a username (an alias), password, email and validation of a CAPTCHA code.

While simply completing the registration web form is in general enough to generate an account, the status label &quot;Inactive&quot; is commonly provided by default until the registered user confirms the email address given while registering indeed belongs to the user. Until that time, the registered user can log into the new account but may not post, reply, or send private messages in the forum.
Sometimes a &quot;referrer system&quot; is implemented. A &quot;referrer&quot; is someone who introduced or otherwise &quot;helped someone&quot; with the decision to join the site (likewise, how a HTTP referrer is the site who linked one to another site). Usually, referrers are other forum members and members are usually rewarded for referrals. The referrer system is also sometimes implemented so that, if a visitor visits the forum through a link such as codice_17, the user with the id number (in this example, 300) would receive referral credit if the visitor registers. The purpose is commonly just to give credit (sometimes rewards are implied) to those who help the community grow.

In areas such as Japan, registration is frequently optional and anonymity is sometimes even encouraged. On these forums, a tripcode system may be used to allow verification of an identity without the need for formal registration. People who regularly read the forum discussions but do not register or do not post are often referred to as &quot;lurkers&quot;.

==Comparison with other web applications==
Electronic mailing lists: The main difference between forums and electronic mailing lists is that mailing lists automatically deliver new messages to the subscriber, while forums require the reader to visit the website and check for new posts. Because members may miss replies in threads they are interested in, many modern forums offer an &quot;e-mail notification&quot; feature, whereby members can choose to be notified of new posts in a thread, and web feeds that allow members to see a summary of the new posts using aggregator software. There are also software products that combine forum and mailing list features, i.e. posting and reading via email as well as the browser depending on the member&#x27;s choice.

Newsreader: The main difference between newsgroups and forums is that additional software, a News client, is required to participate in newsgroups whereas using a forum requires no additional software beyond the web browser.

Shoutboxes: Unlike Internet forums, most shoutboxes do not require registration, only requiring an email address from the user. Additionally, shoutboxes are not heavily moderated, unlike most message boards.

Wiki: Unlike conventional forums, the original wikis allowed all users to edit all content (including each other&#x27;s messages). This level of content manipulation is reserved for moderators or administrators on most forums. Wikis also allow the creation of other content outside the talk pages. On the other hand, weblogs and generic content management systems tend to be locked down to the point where only a few select users can post blog entries, although many allow other users to comment upon them. The Wiki hosting site known as Wikia has two features in operation, known as the Forum and Message Wall. The forum is used solely for discussion and works through editing, while the message wall works through posted messages more similar to a traditional forum.

Chat rooms and instant messaging: Forums differ from chats and instant messaging in that forum participants do not have to be online simultaneously to receive or send messages. Messages posted to a forum are publicly available for some time even if the forum or thread is closed, which is uncommon in chat rooms that maintain frequent activity.

One rarity among forums is the ability to create a picture album. Forum participants may upload personal pictures onto the site and add descriptions to the pictures. Pictures may be in the same format as posting threads, and contain the same options such as &quot;Report Post&quot; and &quot;Reply to Post&quot;.

Samaritan&#x27;s Purse was founded in 1970 by Baptist pastor Robert (Bob) Pierce, the founder of World Vision International, in Boone, North Carolina.

Franklin Graham met Pierce in 1973, and they made several trips together to visit relief projects and missionary partners in Asia and elsewhere. Graham became president of Samaritan&#x27;s Purse in 1979, following Pierce&#x27;s death the prior year.

By 2022, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse had offices in the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Hong Kong, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom; the organization provides assistance in more than 100 countries. It operates worldwide as Samaritan&#x27;s Purse, Ippan Shadan Houjin in Japan and as the Emmanuel Group, a wholly owned aircraft title holding corporation formed in 2004.

== Programs ==
Samaritan&#x27;s Purse includes several ongoing ministries.

* &quot;North American Ministries (NAM)&quot; responds to emergency situations in North America.
** &quot;Operation Heal Our Patriots (OHOP)&quot; provides lodging and outdoor activities in Alaska for wounded veterans and their spouses. It is a sub-ministry of NAM.
* &quot;International Projects&quot; responds to emergency situations around the world
* &quot;World Medical Mission (WWM)&quot;, the medical arm of Samaritan&#x27;s Purse, was founded in 1977 by brothers Dr. Richard Furman and Dr. Lowell Furman to enable doctors to serve short-term assignments at overwhelmed missionary hospitals.
* &quot;Children&#x27;s Heart Project (CHP)&quot; provides surgery for children born with heart defects in countries where proper care is not available.
* &quot;Turn on the Tap&quot; is a campaign to provide safe drinking water in the developing world.

===Operation Christmas Child===
&quot;Operation Christmas Child&quot; was created in 1990 by Dave Cooke and his wife Gill for children in Romania. Each November thousands of churches, schools, groups, and individual donors prepare and collect shoeboxes filled with toys, school supplies, personal items, and other small gifts. A booklet of Bible stories is often distributed alongside the shoebox gifts which are given to children based on need alone, regardless of their faith. These boxes are then distributed overseas by volunteers. , over 124 million boxes had been delivered.

In November 2022, the organization reached a milestone by distributing its 200 millionth Christmas shoebox.
Elizabeth Groff, who was born in Ukraine and adopted by an American family in 2007, delivered the 200 millionth shoebox gift to a child in Ukraine.

The program uses &quot;follow-up&quot; evangelism with pamphlets of Bible stories that are given to families that receive the boxes, and an organizer for Operation Christmas Child says his goal every day is to &quot;expand [God&#x27;s] kingdom through Operation Christmas Child.&quot;

The follow-up evangelism program of Operation Christmas Child is called &quot;The Greatest Journey&quot;. It is a 12-week discipleship program for children who receive shoebox gifts.

=== U.S. Disaster Relief ===
The Samaritan&#x27;s Purse launched a large civilian airlift operation to relieve those affected by Hurricanes Helene (late September 2024) and Milton (early October 2024). The organization completed 358 missions (helicopter and fixed wing). Besides, 30 thousands volunteers participated in cleaning the affected areas from mud, trees, and debris. Samaritan’s Purse deployed more than 5,700 volunteers to support families in Western North Carolina. In November 2024, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse announced the launch of its new Hurricane Helene Rebuild Program.

===Emergency aid===

The organization&#x27;s medical mission in Liberia, West Africa, was one of only two medical NGOs active in Liberia during the beginning of the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Samaritan&#x27;s Purse and SIM USA both have been actively engaged in treating the outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Liberia. On August 1, 2014, the organization announced that it was evacuating 60 nonessential personnel from Liberia. Dr. Kent Brantly, a Texas-based doctor working for the organization, was the first U.S. citizen to contract the Ebola virus in Liberia while treating the disease. He arrived in the United States on Saturday, August 2, and was treated and subsequently released after nearly three weeks in a special isolation unit of Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. The organization recorded their mission in Liberia in the documentary &quot;Facing Darkness&quot;. Samaritan&#x27;s Purse has a fleet of 21 planes and 2 helicopters for the emergency transport of basic necessities and aid workers.

=== Ukraine aid ===
According to the Ukrainian government, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse has been operating in Ukraine since the start of the war in Donbas in 2014. Since the full-scale invasion, the organization, through local partners, has been delivering food, water, warm clothing, and medical assistance. More than 9.6 million Ukrainians have benefited from this aid. The organization has established cooperation with 2,000 Ukrainian partners.

The organization stepped efforts to aid Ukraine in the midst of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in 2022. The first mission staff arrived in Ukraine in February 2022. During the initial phase of the war, a DC-8 aircraft transported up to 84,000 pounds of aid, which was then delivered to Ukraine through Poland. The organization&#x27;s warehouse in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, was used for the aid distribution. By December 2022, the organization had distributed 100 million pounds (45,000 metric tons) of food to those affected by the war in Ukraine. The organization&#x27;s aircraft was also used for evacuating Ukrainian refugees. In May 2022, 28 Ukrainians were flown to Canada.

The organization donated various supplies especially for the youth in schools such as medication, food, supplies, blankets, tarps, and bags. The donations were made through various methods of transportation such as semi trucks being loaded with roughly 80,000 donation goods, being transferred at Piedmont Triad International Airport on the DC-8 airplane, and then being air lifted to Poland where the goods are transported across the border to Ukraine. The organization accomplished its 30th airlift donation in the month of September having started in February, equating to roughly 4 airlifts per month. It is estimated that 5.5 million Ukrainians were aided due to the efforts with food, water, and supplies. Furthermore, the organization provided roughly 30 emergency field support hospitals in Lviv with the result of aiding nearly 18,000 patients.

The deployment of the emergency field hospital in Ukraine began on March 3, 2022. The hospital was located in an underground parking lot of a shopping centre in Lviv. In September 2022, it was reported that the organization supported 30 medical facilities across Ukraine. According to Ukraine&#x27;s Ministry of Health, more than 33,700 outpatient consultations were provided and over 260 surgeries were performed in the field hospitals set up with Samaritan&#x27;s Purse support. Additionally, 253 metric tons of medical supplies were delivered to 164 medical facilities in Ukraine.In December 2022, generators were provided for hospitals in the Kherson region, as well as for the so-called points of invincibility across the region.

To further support Ukraine, in March 2023, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse and its Ukrainian subsidiary, the Samaritan&#x27;s Purse Ukraine Charitable Foundation, signed a five-party memorandum of understanding and cooperation with Ukrainian government structures, including the Ministry of Social Policy, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories.

=== Israel and Gaza Aid === 
The organization provided support to those affected by the Israel-Hamas war. In November 2023, the President of Samaritan’s Purse, Franklin Graham, visited Israel to assess the damage from the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. The organization provided hygiene kits, hot meals, food boxes, and vouchers for internally displaced people in Israel. Also, rescue teams were provided with medical equipment, including defibrillators and 1,000 trauma kits for rapid emergency care. Hot meals and food were delivered in partnership with 50 local churches. During his visit, Franklin Graham suggested that Magen David Adom, Israel’s emergency services system, equivalent to the Red Cross first responders, needed a small fleet of armored ambulances. As of September 2024, Samaritan’s Purse had donated 42 ambulances to Magen David Adom. The organization was also working to support two Christian communities in Gaza by coordinating evacuation routes for them.

== Financials ==
The organization&#x27;s 2021 financial statement listed $758 million in cash donations and another $245 million in donated goods and services. 85% of its $676 million in expenses went to ministry expenses with the largest share (42%) going to their Operation Christmas Child project, 17% to emergency relief, and 7% to its medical missions. Most expenses come from direct costs in delivering in emergencies, medical relief, and Operation Christmas Child (57%) along with staff salaries and other employment expenses (20%).

The organization has received a 4 star rating (out of 4 stars) from the monitoring organization Charity Navigator.

In 2020, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse declined federal funding from the Trump administration originally withheld from the World Health Organization.

== Facilities and fleets ==
Based in Boone, North Carolina, the organization also maintains warehouse and administrative facilities in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina including a former bottling plant and newly constructed facility where its 5 custom tractor trailers used for distributing relief supplies are staged.

The organization also operates a fleet of 23 passenger, cargo, and executive aircraft positioned around the world, registered in the organizations name and to the Emmanuel Group, a holding company.

Operations focused at their maintenance facilities at the Piedmont Triad International Airport, along with additional hangar facilities at the Wilkes County Airport. A $1.5 million taxiway was built by the State of North Carolina 2019 to serve the organization&#x27;s second hangar at that airport under construction at the time. Aircraft serve humanitarian relief missions as well as executive transportation.

The organization donated two Beechcraft King Air B200 aircraft in 2011 to a similar Micronesia-based organization.

== Controversy ==

The organization has been criticized for requiring volunteers to sign a controversial Statement of Faith which disavows homosexuality and same-sex marriage. The organization&#x27;s board of directors, which includes Franklin Graham&#x27;s son, Edward Bell Graham, has also been criticized for the $622,000 yearly salary paid to Graham (as of 2015), which is 40–50% more than similar non-profit organizations.

In March 2001, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Samaritan&#x27;s Purse had &quot;blurred the line between church and state&quot; in the way it had distributed publicly funded aid to victims of the January 2001 and February 2001 El Salvador earthquakes. Residents from several villages stated they first had to sit through a half-hour prayer meeting before receiving assistance. In a statement, USAID said Samaritan&#x27;s Purse had not violated federal guidelines, but emphasized the need for the organization to &quot;maintain adequate and sufficient separation&quot; between prayer sessions and publicly funded activities.

In 2003, Islamic leaders criticized Samaritan&#x27;s Purse within the United Kingdom after its president, Franklin Graham, called Islam a &quot;very evil and wicked religion&quot;, leading to opposition campaigns by the Islamic leaders. Samaritan&#x27;s Purse responded to accusations of being anti-Islamic by highlighting their long history of non-denominational co-operation and charity work in Baghdad without attempting to preach or proselytize.

The Operation Christmas Child project has been criticized in several countries, most notably in the UK, but also in Ireland, India and Canada. In the United States, Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that such religion-and-relief groups are &quot;using their position of power to try to persuade people to leave their faith.&quot; In 2003, the British supermarket chain Co-op and South Wales Fire Service both suspended their support for the project after numerous complaints about its religious connections. Samaritan&#x27;s Purse responded by stating that Christian literature was only handed out where its staff &quot;deemed it appropriate&quot;.

Franklin Graham drew scrutiny in 2009 for drawing a full-time salary from Samaritan&#x27;s Purse, while at the same time receiving a full-time salary from Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA). This was called into question after his 2008 compensation from both organizations totaled $1.2 million (most of this was the result of a new IRS rule that required him to re-report deferred retirement contributions that had already been reported over the previous three years). Some experts on non-profits have questioned whether one person can perform two full-time jobs leading organizations that employ hundreds and spend hundreds of millions around the world. In response to the questions about his compensation, Graham decided to give up his salary from BGEA, stating his calling to the ministry &quot;was never based on compensation.&quot; He also had contributions to his retirement plans suspended until the economy bounced back. However, Graham was again criticized in 2015 when it was revealed he had again taken up his salary from BGEA, and that his annual compensation was significantly higher than that of the CEO&#x27;s of similar but much larger non-profit organisations.

In 2010, an American woman and two Sudanese men were kidnapped while working for Samaritan&#x27;s Purse in Sudan. The two men were released promptly, but the woman was held for three months. Upon her return to the US, she sued Samaritan&#x27;s Purse and their security contractor, Clayton Consultants, a hostage negotiation consultancy owned by Triple Canopy, accusing the organization &quot;of failing to train its security personnel adequately and of willfully ignoring warning signs that abductions were a threat to foreigners.&quot; The organization settled out of court in March 2012.

In May 2013, Franklin Graham wrote a letter to President Obama stating his concern that the IRS targeted Samaritan&#x27;s Purse prior to the 2012 United States presidential election with a partisan audit.

In August 2013, Thankyou Group announced that it would no longer support Samaritan&#x27;s Purse because it is not a signatory to the code of conduct run by the Australian Council for International Development, which bans aid as a vehicle for promoting religion or political groups.

In October 2014, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse threatened legal action in the UK against the posters of online comments on the discussion forum Mumsnet. The resultant letters prompted one of the busiest discussions on the site&#x27;s &quot;Am I being Unreasonable ?&quot; forum.

== Response to the COVID-19 outbreak ==
=== Italy ===
On March 17, 2020, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse dispatched over 60 disaster response specialists, 20 tons of medical equipment and a field hospital to Cremona, Italy which started operations on March 20, 2020.

=== Alaska ===
Samaritans&#x27; Purse airlifted 8 tons of medical supplies to Alaska on April 7, 2020, to help provide supplies to remote communities.

=== New York ===
In cooperation with New York City&#x27;s Mount Sinai Hospital, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse constructed a 14 tent, 68-bed field hospital in Central Park on March 29, 2020, to increase Mount Sinai&#x27;s surge capacity. Through April, over 190 people were treated there. By early May, all patients had been discharged, and there were plans to dismantle the tents.

==== Criticism ====
Before the field hospital opened, journalists, politicians and LGBTQ activists raised concerns that it was only recruiting Christian medical staff and that it would provide inadequate and discriminatory care. Volunteers are required to adhere to a statement of faith, agreeing to a definition of marriage as &quot;exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female&quot; and acknowledging that &quot;[God] will banish the unrighteous to everlasting punishment in hell.&quot; New York Mayor Bill de Blasio stated that the presence of Samaritan&#x27;s Purse was &quot;very troubling,&quot; while New York State Senator Brad Hoylman told &quot;NBC News&quot; that he considered it &quot;a shame that the federal government has left us in the position of having to accept charity from such bigots&quot;. Franklin Graham later responded to Hoylman&#x27;s request for public reassurance by stating: &quot;We do not make distinctions about an individual&#x27;s religion, race, sexual orientation, or economic status. We certainly do not discriminate, and we have a decades-long track record that confirms just that.&quot; New York City&#x27;s Commission on Human Rights closed an investigation into the hospital after finding no evidence it had discriminated against patients. The group&#x27;s departure was hailed as a victory by LGBTQ rights activists. 

Hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson, who volunteered his time and money to help build the field hospital, said that though he found the positions of the group on sexuality &quot;abhorrent&quot;, in his view, helping the Covid response was more important than protesting the group&#x27;s ideologies. He said: &quot;I&#x27;ll have the ideological discussions with them later. If they&#x27;re here saving my fellow New Yorkers&#x27; lives, and not even asking to be paid for it, then I will absolutely help them do that.&quot;

Joint plans between Mount Sinai Hospital, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse and the Episcopal Diocese of New York to convert the Cathedral of St. John the Divine into a 200-bed hospital were shelved on April 9, 2020. Although this decision was attributed at least in part to the assessment that virus-related hospitalizations had already plateaued, Bishop Andrew M.L. Dietsche of the Episcopal Diocese of New York later said that Graham&#x27;s &quot;exclusionary&quot; and &quot;narrow&quot; attitude about Christianity was central to the decision. Specifically, the Samaritan&#x27;s Purse requires its employees and volunteers to oppose gay marriage, which, in Dietsche&#x27;s words, was incompatible with the work the New York Diocese had done &quot;around the full inclusion of gay and lesbian people.&quot;

<text>Michael Okerlund Leavitt (born February 11, 1951) is an American politician who served as the 20th United States secretary of health and human services from 2005 to 2009 and the 10th Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from 2003 to 2005. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 14th governor of Utah from 1993 to 2003.

Leavitt started his career in 1972 and worked in the insurance and risk management industry until 1992. From 1984 until his election as Governor of Utah in 1992, he was the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of The Leavitt Group. As governor, Leavitt worked to establish Western Governors University and the first charter schools in Utah, led the state&#x27;s preparation for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah, was a leader in the implementation of a modernized system of sales tax on e-commerce throughout the United States, negotiated the largest land exchanges between a state and the federal government, initiated an engineering education initiative, worked on the devolution of welfare to the states, and established the Utah Centennial Highway Fund which featured design build highway construction.

Leavitt resigned as governor in 2003 after he was successfully nominated by President George W. Bush to lead the EPA; he was succeeded as governor by Olene Walker, his lieutenant governor. Leavitt was promoted to Secretary of Health and Human Services at the start of Bush&#x27;s second term, serving until the conclusion of the Bush administration. As HHS Secretary, he oversaw the implementation of Medicare Part D, developed the National Pandemic Plan, promoted value-based health care, mitigated the effects of Hurricane Katrina, opened FDA offices in China, India, South America, and reauthorized SCHIP and TANF.

Leavitt now works as a health care advisor, investor, and independent corporate director. In August 2021, he became president of The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square.

==Early life and education==
Leavitt was born in Cedar City, Utah, the son of Phyllis Anne (Okerlund) and Dixie L. Leavitt. Leavitt graduated with a degree in business from Southern Utah University and married Jacalyn Smith. They have five children.

Leavitt is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He is a descendant of an old Massachusetts Puritan family, and a direct descendant of Dudley Leavitt, a Mormon pioneer.

==Career==
===Early career===
Leavitt&#x27;s business career started with his joining The Leavitt Group, a regional insurance company founded by his father. He rose to become the company&#x27;s president and CEO and presided over a period of expansion. He was subsequently appointed to the boards of directors of numerous local and regional companies, including Utah Power and Light, as well as a member of the Utah State Board of Regents. As a regent, he helped oversee Utah&#x27;s nine public colleges and universities. For four years, he was chair of Southern Utah University&#x27;s (SUU) board of trustees.

In 1976, Leavitt assisted his father, then a Utah state senator, in an unsuccessful campaign for governor. He worked on a number of U.S. Senate campaigns through the 1980s for Jake Garn and Orrin Hatch.

===Public service===
====Governor of Utah====
Leavitt first ran for governor in 1992. He had tough competition in the Republican Party primary from Richard Eyre who had more delegates vote for him at the state Republican convention. He defeated Independent Party candidate Merrill Cook and Democratic nominee Stewart Hanson in the general election, becoming the 14th Governor of the State of Utah.

A holiday fire shortly before noon on December 15, 1993, destroyed much of the Utah Governor&#x27;s Mansion, but spared the lives of the first family and staff (Jacalyn Leavitt and some members of the family and staff were in the home at the time of the fire).

Leavitt was re-elected in 1996 with the largest vote total in state history. While Governor, he and Roy Romer of Colorado were the two key founders of Western Governors University in 1997, one of the first exclusively online schools in the nation. In addition to Leavitt and Romer, 17 other governors signed legislation creating the school as a non-profit private university.

In 2000, Leavitt became only the second governor in Utah history to be re-elected to a third term. As governor, he held leadership positions in national and regional organizations, which included chairing the Republican Governors Association from 1994 to 1995, the Western Governors Association from 1995 to 1996, the Council of State Governments from 1996 to 1997, and the National Governors Association from 1999 to 2000.

==== EPA Administrator ====
On August 11, 2003, President George W. Bush nominated Leavitt as Administrator of the EPA at a press conference in Aurora, Colorado. He was confirmed on October 28, 2003, by a vote of 88–8 in the United States Senate. On November 5, having resigned the governorship, Leavitt was sworn in as the 10th Administrator of the EPA.

At the EPA he implemented higher standards for ozone, diesel fuels and other air pollutants. He organized and managed a collaboration to develop a federal plan to clean up the Great Lakes. He is also the co-author of an environmental policy called Enlibra.

==== Secretary of Health and Human Services ====
On December 13, 2004, Leavitt was nominated by Bush to succeed Tommy Thompson as Secretary of HHS, and was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on January 26, 2005. He was commonly known for his advocating that Medicare was drifting toward financial insolvency.

Secretary Leavitt cited the work of the World Health Organization&#x27;s Michael McCoy as the most compelling scientific work into the avian flu threat. This encouraged Leavitt to mobilize the nation&#x27;s pandemic preparedness and led to the reconfiguring of the nation&#x27;s medical emergency plans. 

Leavitt also served on the Homeland Security Advisory Council. In August 2007, Leavitt became the first cabinet-level blogger in U.S. history.

====Presidential transitions ====
During the 2012 presidential campaign, Leavitt was Chairman of the Transition Committee for Republican nominee Mitt Romney. This was the first time a Presidential transition had planned under the Presidential Transition Act of 2010. In August 2012, &quot;Politico&quot; reported Leavitt to be &quot;creating a government-in-waiting plan for Mitt Romney&quot; and &quot;a lock for... White House chief of staff or Treasury secretary&quot; in a potential Romney administration if he had won that year&#x27;s presidential election against incumbent Barack Obama.

In 2014 and 2015, Leavitt advised Congress on how to improve the statutes governing presidential transitions. On December 18, 2015, the Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 was signed into law by President Barack Obama.

In the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, Leavitt was part of a team organized by the Center for Public Service and the Center for Presidential Transition who advised both Republicans and Democrats&#x27; presidential campaigns on the development of effective transitions plans.

====Electoral reform====
In 2013, Leavitt partnered with former Utah First Lady Norma Matheson and businesswoman Gail Miller to launch &quot;Count My Vote&quot;, a bipartisan effort to push for state electoral reform. Together, they successfully lobbied for a new law allowing candidates access to the primary election ballot by gathering signatures in Utah.

===Leavitt Partners===
In 2009, Leavitt organized Leavitt Partners, a consulting firm to advise clients in health care policy matters. The firm evolved into a leading authority on value-based health care.

In April 2021, Leavitt Partners merged with Health Management Associates and Leavitt was appointed Co-Chairman of the combined firm.

===Tabernacle Choir president===
On August 6, 2021, Gérald Caussé, the LDS Church&#x27;s presiding bishop, announced that Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square president Ron Jarrett was stepping down after nine years of service and that Leavitt would replace him in that role.

===Philanthropy===
Leavitt&#x27;s family charitable foundation, the Dixie and Anne Leavitt Foundation, was established by the Leavitt family in 2000, and the family has donated nearly $9 million of assets to it since.

<doc id="294827" wikidata="Q644971" url="?curid=294827" title="Legal positivism">
<text>In jurisprudence and legal philosophy, legal positivism is the theory that the existence of the law and its content depend on social facts, such as acts of legislation, judicial decisions, and customs, rather than on morality. This contrasts with other jurisprudence, such as natural law theory, that holds that law is necessarily connected to morality in such a way that any law that contradicts morality lacks legal validity.

Thomas Hobbes defined law as the command of the sovereign. This idea was elaborated in the 18th and 19th centuries by legal philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Austin, who argued that a law is valid not because it is intrinsically moral or just, but because it comes from the sovereign, is generally obeyed by the people, and is backed up by sanctions. Hans Kelsen developed legal positivism further by separating law not only from morality, as the early positivists did, but also from empirical facts, introducing the concept of a norm as an &quot;ought&quot; statement as distinct from a factual &quot;is&quot; statement. In Kelsen&#x27;s view, the validity of a legal norm derives from a higher norm, creating a hierarchy that ultimately rests on a &quot;basic norm&quot;: this basic norm, not the sovereign, is the ultimate source of legal authority.
In addition to Kelsen, other prominent legal positivists of the 20th century include H. L. A. Hart and Joseph Raz.

== Etymology and semantics ==

The term &quot;positivism&quot; in &quot;legal positivism&quot; is connected to the sense of the verb &quot;to posit&quot; rather than the sense of &quot;positive&quot; (as opposed to &quot;negative&quot;). In this sense, the term &quot;positivism&quot; is derived from Latin , the past participle of , meaning &quot;to place&quot; or &quot;to put&quot;. Legal positivism holds that laws are rules established (that is, &quot;posited&quot;) by human beings, and that this act of positing the law makes it authoritative and binding.

==Concept==
According to the positivist view, the source of a law is its enactment or recognition by a legal authority that is socially accepted and capable of enforcing its rules. The merits of a law are a separate issue from its legal validity: a law may be morally wrong or undesirable, but if it has been enacted by a legal authority with the power to do so, it is still a valid law.

Leslie Green summarises the distinction between merit and source: &quot;The fact that a policy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient reason for thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is unjust, unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason for doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has been posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.); as we might say in a more modern idiom, positivism is the view that law is a social construction.&quot;

Legal positivism does not claim that the laws so identified should be obeyed, or that there is necessarily value in having clear, identifiable rules (although some positivists may also make these claims). Indeed, the laws of a legal system may be quite unjust, and the government may be illegitimate; as a result, there may be no obligation to obey the law. Moreover, the fact that a law has been found to be valid by a court does not mean that the court should apply it in a particular case. As John Gardner has said, legal positivism is &quot;normatively inert&quot;. It is a theory of law, not a theory of legal practice, adjudication, or political obligation, and legal positivists generally maintain that intellectual clarity is best achieved by separating these issues for independent analysis.

== Inclusive and exclusive legal positivism ==
Analytical jurisprudence often distinguishes between two types of legal positivism: inclusive and exclusive legal positivism. The former accepts, whereas the latter denies, that there may be cases in which determining what the law is follows from considerations about what the law ought to be according to morality.

Both qualify as legal positivism because they share two basic tenets. First, the &quot;social thesis&quot;: law is essentially a human creation and therefore its content is ultimately determined by social facts, such as acts of legislation, judicial decisions, and customs. Second, the &quot;separation thesis&quot;: law and morality are conceptually distinct phenomena and therefore a norm can belong to the law even if is unjust or unfair.

On the bedrock of these two shared assumptions, the two theories differ in their interpretation of how morality might influence law.

According to inclusive legal positivism (also called &quot;soft positivism&quot;) it is possible that the criteria for identifying valid laws in a given legal system (that is, in Hart&#x27;s terminology, its &quot;rule of recognition&quot;) incorporate moral standards. In other words, while law and morality are conceptually distinct, a particular legal system might, as a matter of fact, make the validity of some laws dependent on their moral merit. Typically, this happens when a constitution includes a clause requiring laws to respect human rights, or human dignity, or equality, thus incorporating some moral standard into the legal system. Conformity with moral principle may be a condition of legal validity. However, this is not necessarily the case, but is contingent upon the content of the law and its rule of recognition, which may or may not include moral standards. Inclusive legal positivism has been embraced or defended by authors such as Jules Coleman, Matthew Kramer, Wil Waluchow, and H. L. A. Hart himself.

According to exclusive legal positivism (&quot;hard positivism&quot;) the validity of a law is never determined by its moral content, but depends only on its source (e.g., being enacted by a legislature) and its compliance with the legal system&#x27;s formal procedures. Therefore, if the constitution reference moral principles, these principles are not incorporated into the law as moral standards but rather the constitution is authorising the judges and the other law-applying institutions to develop and modify the law by resorting to moral reasoning. Conformity with moral principle is necessarily not a condition of legal validity. Exclusive legal positivism is mainly associated with the name of Joseph Raz and has been advocated by authors such as Brian Leiter, Andrei Marmor and Scott Shapiro.

To sum up, inclusive positivism allows for the possibility that morality can play a role in determining legal validity in some legal systems, while exclusive positivism holds that morality can never be a direct criterion for legal validity, even if a legal system references moral concepts.

== Methodological, theoretical and ideological legal positivism==
In 1961 Norberto Bobbio argued that the phrase &quot;legal positivism&quot; is used with three different meanings, referring to different and largely independent doctrines, which he called &quot;positivism as a way of approaching the study of law&quot; (methodological legal positivism), &quot;positivism as a theory or conception of law&quot; (theoretical legal positivism) and &quot;positivism as an ideology of justice&quot; (Ideological legal positivism).

Methodological legal positivism is a value-free, scientific approach to the study of law and, at the same time, is a way of conceiving the object of legal knowledge. It is characterised by a sharp distinction between real law and ideal law (or &quot;law as fact&quot; and &quot;law as value&quot;, &quot;law as it is&quot; and &quot;law as it should be&quot;) and by the conviction that legal science should be concerned with the former.

Theoretical legal positivism is a cluster of theories about the nature of law related to a &quot;statalist&quot; conception of law. They include the theory that the law is a set of commands issued by the sovereign authority, whose binding force is guaranteed by the threat of sanctions (coercitive imperativism); a theory of legal sources, in which statute law enjoys supremacy (legalism); a theory of the legal order, which is supposed to be a complete and coherent system of norms, free of gaps (lacunae) and contradictions (antinomies); and a theory of legal interpretation, conceived of as a pure act of cognition: a mechanical and logical activity.

Finally, ideological legal positivism is defined by Bobbio as the normative theory according to which positive law ought to be obeyed (ethical legalism).

== Compared to legal realism ==
Sometimes the term &#x27;positivist&#x27; is used in a pejorative sense to condemn a doctrine according to which the law is always clear (legal formalism) and, however unjust, must be strictly enforced by officials and obeyed by subjects (so-called &#x27;ideological positivism&#x27;). When identified with legal formalism, legal positivism is opposed to legal realism. Legal positivism, understood as formalism, believes that in most cases the law provides definite guidance to its subjects and to judges; legal realists, on the other hand, often embrace rule scepticism, claiming that legal rules are indeterminate and do not constrain judicial discretion. However, both legal positivism and legal realism believe that law is a human construct. Moreover, most realists adopted some version of the positivist doctrine of the separation of law and morality.

According to Brian Leiter, the view that positivism and realism are incompatible positions is probably largely due to Hart&#x27;s critique of legal realism, but American legal realists were &quot;tacit legal positivists&quot; who acknowledged that all law stems from authoritative sources such as statutes and precedents. Most legal realists denied the existence of natural law, had a scientific approach to the law based on the distinction between describing and evaluating the law, and denied the existence of an objective (moral or political) obligation to obey the law; they therefore qualified as legal positivists.

== Criticism ==
Legal positivism in Germany was famously rejected by Gustav Radbruch in 1946 where prosecution of Nazi supporters faced a challenge of assessing actions that had complied with Nazi law. In what has come to be known as the Radbruch formula, he argued that in general an unjust law must be recognised as law, &quot;unless the conflict between statute and justice reaches such an intolerable degree that the statute, as &#x27;flawed law&#x27;, must yield to justice&quot; or, more precisely: &quot;Where there is not even an attempt at justice, where equality, the core of justice, is deliberately betrayed in the issuance of positive law, then the statute is not merely &#x27;flawed law&#x27;, it lacks completely the very nature of law.&quot;

== History ==

=== Antecedents ===
The main antecedent of legal positivism is empiricism, the thinkers of which range back as far as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Auguste Comte. The main idea of empiricism is the claim that all knowledge of fact must be validated by sense experience or be inferred from propositions derived unambiguously from sense data. Further, empiricism is in opposition to metaphysics; for instance, Hume rejected metaphysics as mere speculation beyond what can be learnt from sense experience. The teachings of the empiricists preceded systemization of a positivist method for problems of comprehension and analysis, which was later represented by legal positivism.

===Methodology===
Traditionally, positivist theories of law have been developed by theorists applying the method of conceptual analysis to determine what is &#x27;natural to say&#x27;. This approach assumes that legal concepts, being &#x27;settled by the classificatory machinery of human thought&#x27;, are &#x27;amenable only to philosophical … reflection&#x27;. Recently, researchers in the emerging field of experimental jurisprudence have challenged this assumption by exploring the relation between law and morality through systematic, psychological investigations of folk legal concepts.

Legal positivism is related to empiricist and logical positivist theoretical traditions. Its methods include descriptive investigations of particular legal orders. Peter Curzon wrote that this approach &quot;utilizes in its investigations the inductive method&quot; which proceeds &quot;from observation of particular facts to generalizations concerning all such facts.&quot; These investigations eschew assessments of ethics, social welfare, and morality. As Julius Stone wrote, legal positivist investigation is concerned primarily with &quot;an analysis of legal terms, and an inquiry into the &quot;logical&quot; interrelations of legal propositions&quot;. 
Further, law and its authority are framed as source-based: the validity of a legal norm depends not on its moral value, but on the sources determined by a social community&#x27;s rules and conventions. This source-based conception aligns with the logical positivism of Rudolf Carnap, who rejected metaphysical conjecture about the nature of reality beyond observable events.

===Thomas Hobbes and &quot;Leviathan&quot;===
Thomas Hobbes, in his seminal work &quot;Leviathan&quot;, offered the first detailed theory of law as based on sovereign power. As Jean Elizabeth Hampton writes, &quot;law is understood [by Hobbes] to depend on the sovereign&#x27;s will. No matter what a law&#x27;s content, no matter how unjust it seems, if it has been commanded by the sovereign, then and only then is it law.&quot; There is, however, debate surrounding Hobbes&#x27;s status as a legal positivist.

===Jeremy Bentham===
The English jurist and philosopher Jeremy Bentham was arguably the greatest British legal positivist. In &quot;An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation&quot;, Bentham developed a theory of law as the expressed will of a sovereign. In &#x27;A Fragment on Government&#x27;, Bentham distinguished between the following types of people:
* &quot;Expositors&quot; – those who explained what the law in practice was;
* &quot;Censors&quot; – those who criticised the law in practice and compared it to their notions of what it ought to be.
The philosophy of law, considered strictly, was to explain the real laws of the expositors, rather than the criticisms of the censors.

Bentham is also noted for terming natural rights &quot;nonsense upon stilts&quot;.

===John Austin&#x27;s command theory===
John Austin partly emulated Bentham by writing &quot;The Province of Jurisprudence Determined&quot;. However, Austin differed from Bentham in a number of ways, as, for example, by endorsing the common law.

Differences aside, Austin embraced Hobbes&#x27;s and Bentham&#x27;s conception of law as a sovereign command, whose authority is recognised by most members of a society; the authority of which is enforced by the use of sanctions, but which is not bound by any human superior. The criterion for validity of a legal rule in such a society is that it has the warrant of the sovereign and will be enforced by the sovereign power and its agents.

The three main tenets of Austin&#x27;s command theory are:
* laws are commands issued by the uncommanded commander, i.e. the sovereign;
* such commands are enforced by sanctions;
* a sovereign is one who is obeyed by the majority.

Austin considered law to be commands from a sovereign that are enforced by a threat of sanction. In determining &#x27;a sovereign&#x27;, Austin recognised it is one whom society obeys habitually. This sovereign can be a single person or a collective sovereign such as Parliament, with a number of individuals, with each having various authoritative powers. Austin&#x27;s theory is also somewhat brief in his explanations of Constitutions, International Law, non-sanctioned rules, or law that &quot;gives&quot; rights. Insofar as non-sanctioned rules and laws that &quot;allow&quot; persons to do things, such as contract law, Austin said that failure to obey the rules does result in sanctions; however, such sanctions are in the form of &quot;the sanction of nullity&quot;.

===Hans Kelsen===

The British legal positivism hitherto mentioned was founded on empiricism; by contrast, legal positivism was founded on the transcendental idealism of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Whereas British legal positivists regard law as distinct from morals, their Germanic counterparts regard law as separate from both fact and morals. The most famous proponent of Germanic legal positivism is Hans Kelsen, whose thesis of legal positivism is explained by Suri Ratnapala, who writes:

From this framework, Kelsen opined that the regression of validated norms cannot go on infinitely and must arrive at a first cause, which he called a  (). The legal system is therefore a system of legal norms connected to one another by their common origin, like the branches and leaves of a tree.

For Kelsen, &quot;sovereignty&quot; was an arbitrary concept: &quot;We can derive, however, from this concept of sovereignty only what we have purposely put into its definition&quot;.
Kelsen attracted disciples among scholars of public law worldwide. These disciples developed schools of thought to extend his theories, such as the Vienna School in Austria and the Brno School in Czechoslovakia. In English-speaking countries, H. L. A. Hart and Joseph Raz are perhaps the best-known authors who were influenced by Kelsen, though their legal philosophies differed from Kelsen&#x27;s theories in several respects.

===H. L. A. Hart===
Hart approved of Austin&#x27;s theory of a sovereign but claimed that Austin&#x27;s command theory failed in several important respects. Among the ideas Hart developed in &quot;The Concept of Law&quot; (1961) are:
* a critique of Austin&#x27;s theory that a law is a command of the sovereign enforced by a threat of punishment;
* a distinction between internal and external consideration of law and rules, influenced by Max Weber&#x27;s distinction between legal and sociological perspectives on law;
* a distinction between primary and secondary legal rules, such that a primary rule, such as a criminal law, governs conduct, and secondary rules provide methods by which primary rules are recognized, changed or judicially applied. Hart identifies three types of secondary rule:
** a rule of recognition, a rule by which any member of society may check to discover what the primary rules of the society are;
** a rule of change, by which existing primary rules might be created, altered or abolished;
** a rule of adjudication, by which the society might determine when a rule has been violated and prescribe a remedy;
* a late reply (1994 edition) to Ronald Dworkin, who, in &quot;Taking Rights Seriously&quot; (1977), &quot;A Matter of Principle&quot; (1985) and &quot;Law&#x27;s Empire&quot; (1986), criticized legal positivism in general and Hart&#x27;s account of law in particular.

====Five contentions====

In 1958, Hart analyzed descriptions or definitions as given by different proponents of legal positivism as including one or more of these five contentions in different combinations:
* laws are commands of human beings;
* there is not any necessary relation between law and morality, that is, between law as it is and as it ought to be;
* analysis (or study of the meaning) of legal concepts is worthwhile and is to be distinguished from history or sociology of law, as well as from criticism or appraisal of law, for example with regard to its moral value or to its social aims or functions;
* a legal system is a closed, logical system in which correct decisions can be deduced from predetermined legal rules without reference to social considerations (legal formalism);
* moral judgments, unlike statements of fact, cannot be established or defended by rational argument, evidence, or proof (&quot;noncognitivism&quot; in ethics).
Historically, legal positivism is in opposition to natural law&#x27;s theories of jurisprudence, with particular disagreement surrounding the natural law claim that there is a necessary connection between law and morality.

===Joseph Raz===
A pupil of Hart&#x27;s, Joseph Raz was important in continuing Hart&#x27;s arguments of legal positivism after Hart&#x27;s death. This included editing in 1994 a second edition of Hart&#x27;s &quot;The Concept of Law&quot;, with an additional section including Hart&#x27;s responses to other philosophers&#x27; criticisms of his work.

Raz also argued, contrary to Hart, that the validity of a law can &quot;never&quot; depend on its morality.

<doc id="294829" wikidata="Q1162700" url="?curid=294829" title="Daniel Shays">
<text>Daniel Shays (August 1747 – September 29, 1825) was an American soldier, revolutionary and farmer famous for allegedly leading Shays&#x27; Rebellion, a populist uprising against controversial debt collection and tax policies that took place in Massachusetts between 1786 and 1787. The actual role played by Shays in the rebellion is disputed by scholars.

==Early life==
Daniel Ogden Shays was born in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, sometime between April and August 1747 to Irish immigrants Patrick Shays and Margaret Dempsey. Daniel was the second of seven siblings; his siblings were Margaret, James, Roger, Phebe, Mary, and Polly. He spent his early years as a landless farm laborer. In 1772, he married Abigail Gilbert, and they settled in Shutesbury, Massachusetts, where he owned a sixty-eight acre farm and they had six children.

==Revolutionary War==
Shays joined the militia immediately prior to the American Revolution and attained the rank of sergeant in the regiment commanded by Benjamin Ruggles Woodbridge. The Battles of Lexington and Concord took place on April 19, 1775, and the next day Shays&#x27;s unit was mobilized and marched to Boston. His company took part in the Boston campaign and Siege of Boston, and Shays fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Shortly after Bunker Hill, Shays was commissioned as a second lieutenant in recognition of the bravery and skill he demonstrated during the fighting. In late 1776, Shays joined Varnum&#x27;s Regiment of the Continental Army, with which he served during fighting in New York and New Jersey. After performing temporary recruiting duty in Massachusetts during late 1776, on January 1, 1777, Shays was promoted to captain as commander of a company in the 5th Massachusetts Regiment. During 1777, Shays took part in several engagements in upstate New York, including the Battles of Saratoga. 

After Saratoga, Shays continued to serve with the Continental Army in upstate New York. As commander of a company in the Corps of Light Infantry, which was commanded by Anthony Wayne, Shays took part in the July 1779 Battle of Stony Point. He subsequently served as commander of a company under the Marquis de Lafayette, which patrolled farmland on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River to prevent British troops from foraging. In 1780, Lafayette presented several officers, including Shays, with ornamental swords in honor of their military service. Shays sold his for cash to help pay off debts; he argued that there was nothing wrong with his action, because he already owned a sword, but his decision to sell his was frowned upon by his peers. After British officer John André was captured while collaborating with Continental officer Benedict Arnold&#x27;s plot to surrender West Point to the British, Shays was assigned as one of the captains of the guard who oversaw André&#x27;s imprisonment, a task for which Continental Army commander-in-chief George Washington personally selected him. Shays was present when André was executed on October 2, 1780, and was probably the officer who escorted him to the gallows. Shays resigned soon afterwards, and was discharged from the army on October 14, 1780.

==Shays&#x27; Rebellion==
===Debt and tax burdens===
Upon returning home, Shays was summoned to court for unpaid debts, which he could not pay because he had not been paid in full for his military service. Shays was alarmed to discover that many of his fellow veterans and farmers were in the same financial situation. At commoners&#x27; meetings veterans asserted that they were treated unfairly upon release, and that businessmen were trying to squeeze money out of smallholders in order to pay their own debts to European war investors. Many Massachusetts rural communities first tried to petition the legislature in Boston, but the legislature did not respond substantively to those petitions. 

The petitions and proposals often included a request to issue paper currency. Such inflationary issues would depreciate the currency, making it possible to meet obligations made at high values with lower-valued paper. Merchants, among them James Bowdoin, were opposed to these proposals because they were generally lenders who stood to lose. The proposals were repeatedly rejected. Governor John Hancock, accused by some of anticipating trouble, abruptly resigned in early 1785. When Bowdoin (a loser to Hancock in earlier elections) was elected governor that year, matters became more severe. Bowdoin stepped up civil actions to collect back taxes, and the legislature exacerbated the situation by levying an additional property tax to raise funds for the state&#x27;s portion of foreign debt payments. Even comparatively conservative commentators like John Adams observed that these levies were &quot;heavier than the People could bear&quot;.

===Protests against the courts===
Protests in rural Massachusetts turned into direct action in August 1786 after the state legislature adjourned without considering the many petitions that had been sent to Boston. On August 29, a well-organized force of protestors, Shays among them, marched on Northampton and successfully prevented the county court from sitting. The leaders of this and later forces proclaimed that they were seeking relief from the burdensome judicial processes that were depriving the people of their land and possessions. They called themselves &quot;Regulators&quot;, a reference to the Regulator movement of North Carolina that sought to reform corrupt practices in the late 1760s. On September 2, Governor Bowdoin issued a proclamation denouncing such mob action, but took no military measures in response beyond planning militia response to future actions. 

When the court in Worcester was shut-down by similar action on September 5, the county militia (composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors) refused to turn out, much to Bowdoin&#x27;s amazement.

Shays, who had participated in the Northampton action, became involved in the uprising in November; though the precise role that Shays played is unclear and, as scholars have suggested, appears to have been exaggerated by contemporary elites. Historian Leonard Richards observes that &quot;much of the backlash [against Shays and the protestors] was due to the Boston elite. Had they treated Daniel Shays as simply a small-town rebel leader, the aftermath might have been different. But they portrayed him instead as a major villain.&quot; On September 19, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts indicted eleven leaders of the rebellion as &quot;disorderly, riotous, and seditious persons.&quot; When the supreme judicial court was next scheduled to meet in Springfield on September 26, Shays in Hampshire County and Luke Day in what is now Hampden County (but was then part of Hampshire County) organized an attempt to shut it down. They were anticipated by William Shepard, the local militia commander, who began gathering government-supporting militia the Saturday before the court was to sit. By the time the court was ready to open, Shepard had 300 men protecting the Springfield courthouse. Shays and Day were able to recruit a similar number, but chose only to demonstrate, exercising their troops outside Shepard&#x27;s lines, rather than attempt to seize the building. The judges first postponed the hearings, and then adjourned on the 28th without hearing any cases. Shepard withdrew his force, which had grown to around 800 men (to the Regulators&#x27; 1,200), to the federal armory, which was then only rumored to be the target of seizure by the activists.

===Plan to seize the Springfield Arsenal===
On November 28, a posse of around 300 men rode to Groton to arrest Job Shattuck and other protest leaders in the area. Shattuck was chased-down and arrested on the 30th, and was wounded by a sword slash in the process. This action and the arrest of other protest leaders in the eastern parts of the state radicalized those in the west, and they began to organize an overthrow of the state government. &quot;The seeds of war are now sown&quot;, wrote one correspondent in Shrewsbury, and by mid-January rebel leaders spoke of smashing the &quot;tyrannical government of Massachusetts.&quot;

While government forces organized in the east, Shays, Day, and other rebel leaders in the west organized their forces, establishing regional regimental organizations that were run by democratically elected committees. Their first major target was the federal armory in Springfield. General Shepard had, however, pursuant to orders from Governor Bowdoin, taken possession of the armory and used its arsenal to arm a force of around 1,200 militia.

===Attack and collapse===
The insurgents were organized into three major groups, and intended to surround and simultaneously attack the armory. Shays led one group east of Springfield near Palmer, Luke Day had a second force across the Connecticut River in West Springfield, and the third force, under Eli Parsons, was to the north at Chicopee. The rebels had planned their assault for January 25, but Luke Day changed this at the last minute, sending Shays a message indicating he would not be ready to attack until the 26th. Day&#x27;s message was intercepted by Shepard&#x27;s men, so the militia of Shays and Parsons, around 1,500 men, approached the armory on the 25th not knowing they would have no support from the west.
When Shays and his forces neared the armory, they found Shepard&#x27;s militia waiting for them. Shepard first ordered warning shots fired over the approaching Shaysites&#x27; heads, and then ordered two cannons to fire grapeshot at Shays&#x27; men. Four Shaysites were killed and twenty wounded. There was no musket fire from either side, and the rebel advance collapsed. Most of the rebel force fled north, eventually regrouping at Amherst. On the opposite side of the river, Day&#x27;s forces also fled north, also eventually reaching Amherst.

General Benjamin Lincoln had mustered 3,000 men at Worcester to deal with the rebels. When he heard of the Springfield incident, they immediately began marching west. Shays led the rebel force generally north and east to avoid Lincoln, eventually establishing a camp at Petersham. Along the way they raided the shops of local merchants for supplies, taking some of them hostage. Lincoln pursued them, reaching Pelham, around from Petersham, on February 2. On the night of February 3–4, he led his militia on a forced march to Petersham through a bitter snowstorm. Arriving early in the morning, they surprised the rebel camp so thoroughly that they scattered &quot;without time to call in their out parties or even their guards.&quot; Although Lincoln claimed to capture 150 men, none of them were officers, leading historian Leonard Richards to suspect the veracity of the report. Shays and some of the other leaders escaped north into New Hampshire and Vermont.

Around four thousand people signed confessions acknowledging participation in the events of the rebellion (in exchange for amnesty); several hundred participants were eventually indicted on charges relating to the rebellion. Most of these were pardoned under a general amnesty that only excluded a few ringleaders. Eighteen men, including Shays, were convicted and sentenced to death. Most of these either had their convictions overturned on appeal, were pardoned, or had their sentences commuted. Two of the condemned men, John Bly and Charles Rose, were hanged on December 6, 1787. Shays was pardoned in 1788 and he returned to Massachusetts from hiding in the Vermont woods. He was, however, vilified by the Boston press, who painted him as an archetypal radical opposed to the government.

==Later life==
Shays was later granted a pension by the federal government for the five years he served in the Continental Army without pay. Shays lived the last few years of his life in poverty, a heavy drinker. He supported himself on his pension and by working a small parcel of land. Shays died at age 78 in Sparta, New York and was later buried at the Union Cemetery in Scottsburg.

==Rededicated grave marker==
The original gravestone for Shays contained an error; by dropping the &quot;s&quot;, Shays was incorrectly spelled as &quot;Shay&quot;. Philip R. Shays, of Clarence Center, New York, a descendant of Daniel Shays, led an effort to correct the error. Because the original stone did not contain enough space to add a letter, a new marker was created. The new gravestone was dedicated in a ceremony on August 12, 2016.

<doc id="294830" wikidata="Q763092" url="?curid=294830" title="Planxty">
<text>Planxty were an Irish folk music band formed in January 1972, consisting initially of Christy Moore (vocals, acoustic guitar, bodhrán), Andy Irvine (vocals, mandolin, mandola, bouzouki, hurdy-gurdy, harmonica), Dónal Lunny (bouzouki, guitars, bodhrán, keyboards), and Liam O&#x27;Flynn (uilleann pipes, tin whistle). They transformed and popularized Irish folk music, touring and recording to great acclaim.

Subsequently, Johnny Moynihan, Paul Brady, Matt Molloy (flute), Bill Whelan (keyboards), Nollaig Casey (fiddle) and briefly, Noel Hill (concertina) and Tony Linnane (fiddle) were also temporary members.

Planxty broke up twice, first in December 1975 and again in April 1983. The original quartet reunited in October 2003 and their final performance was on 31 January 2005.

==History==

===Formation and first run (1972–1975)===

Christy Moore and Dónal Lunny had been friends since school days in Newbridge, County Kildare, Lunny having taught Moore how to play both guitar and bodhrán. Before the formation of Planxty, Lunny had been playing in a duet with Andy Irvine after the latter&#x27;s return from Eastern Europe and they had also launched their own folk club, downstairs at Slattery&#x27;s, called The Mugs Gig. Liam O&#x27;Flynn was playing in public and on the radio, and was well respected in traditional folk circles. All members were familiar with one another&#x27;s work to varying degrees but were first brought together during the summer of 1971 to record Moore&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Prosperous,&quot; at his sister&#x27;s house, in the village of the same name.

In January 1972, the four joined forces to form Planxty, recording their first single, &quot;Three Drunken Maidens&quot;/&quot;Sí-Bheag, Sí-Mhór&quot;, in Trend Studios on 18 January 1972. The band performed on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Late, Late Show&quot; the following Saturday, 22 January 1972, and played their first show on 6 March 1972, a 30-minute set at The Mugs Gig on a bill that included balladeer Paddy Reilly. They then assumed a weekly residency at The Mugs Gig, began rehearsing, and started playing live around Ireland.

The group&#x27;s first major performance–opening for Donovan at the Hangar in Galway, at Easter 1972–was a huge success. Neither the audience nor the band knew what to expect, and both were pleasantly surprised. Irvine, unable to see the audience through the glare of the stage lights, was worried that the crowd might be on the verge of rioting. It took him several minutes to realize that what he was hearing was the expression of their enthusiasm. A rough quality recording of the song &quot;Raggle Taggle Gypsy&quot; from this concert was included on the 2004 retrospective, &quot;Christy Moore – The Box Set: 1964–2004&quot;, complete with the audience&#x27;s reaction.

Planxty&#x27;s first single, &quot;Three Drunken Maidens&quot;, was released by their manager Des Kelly&#x27;s label, Ruby Records, reaching no. 7 in the Irish charts. The next single, a re-recording of &quot;The Cliffs of Dooneen&quot;, previously recorded for the &quot;Prosperous&quot; album, made it to no. 3. Two full albums followed: &quot;Planxty&quot;, recorded at Command Studios in London during September 1972, and &quot;The Well Below the Valley&quot;, recorded at the Escape Studios in Kent, from 18 June 1973.

The group&#x27;s increasing popularity led to heavy touring throughout Ireland, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and northern Europe.

Tired of constant touring and wishing to explore other musical avenues, Lunny left Planxty at the start of September 1973, playing his last gig with the band at the Edinburgh Festival. He would eventually end up a member of The Bothy Band. Johnny Moynihan, who had played with Irvine in Sweeney&#x27;s Men, joined at this point, playing mandolin, bouzouki, fiddle, tin whistle and singing. This line-up, with contributions from Lunny, would record Planxty&#x27;s third album, &quot;Cold Blow and the Rainy Night&quot; in Sarm Studios, Whitechapel in London during August 1974.

Next to leave, shortly after the making of this album, was Moore, who had a desire to return to his solo career and perform from a larger repertoire of songs. The split was amicable, and while Paul Brady was recruited to fill the gap in September 1974, Moore stayed on with him in the band until October. After his departure, the Irvine/Moynihan/Brady/O’Flynn line-up toured extensively but released no recordings before playing their final show in Brussels on 5 December 1975.

===Reunion and second run (1978–1983)===

After the break-up, Moynihan retreated into obscurity, continuing to perform occasionally, but rarely recorded. Irvine and Brady toured together as a duo and, in August 1976 recorded an album at the Rockfield Studios, &quot;Andy Irvine/Paul Brady&quot;, produced by Lunny who also plays on most tracks, and with Kevin Burke on fiddle. For a while, Irvine continued to tour with Brady in Ireland and in the UK, and also with Mick Hanly, predominantly in Europe. In 1978, Brady released a solo album (&quot;Welcome Here Kind Stranger&quot;) including Irvine, Tommy Peoples and Lunny who also produced it.

The original four members of Planxty, however, continued to encounter each other socially, on the stage, and in the studio. It eventually led to a reunion encouraged by music promoter Kevin Flynn, who would become their manager. They were joined this time by Matt Molloy, who had been a member of The Bothy Band with Lunny and was also a close friend of O&#x27;Flynn&#x27;s. Beginning rehearsals at Molloy&#x27;s home on Tuesday, 19 September 1978, the line-up went on a mammoth European tour the following year, from 15 April to 11 June 1979, during which the band played forty-seven concerts in fifty-eight days, in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, France and Ireland.

From 18 to 30 June 1979, Planxty recorded their fourth album, &quot;After the Break&quot;, at the Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin; it was produced by Lunny and released on the Tara Records label. Molloy left the group to join The Chieftains shortly after the album was recorded; he remains with them to this day. In between the Planxty activity, Irvine squeezed in tours in Europe with Lunny, Mick Hanly and Gerry O&#x27;Beirne. He also recorded his first solo album, &quot;Rainy Sundays... Windy Dreams&quot;, at Windmill Lane Studios in late 1979, produced by Lunny and released on Tara Records in 1980.

On 28 February 1980, Planxty headlined the Sense of Ireland concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. When they returned to Ireland, they recorded two programmes for RTÉ at the Pavilion Theatre in Dún Laoghaire, then started rehearsals at Kilkea Castle in Castledermot, County Kildare with two musicians from County Clare: concertina player Noel Hill and fiddler Tony Linnane. The six-member lineup of Moore, Irvine, Lunny, O’Flynn, Hill, and Linnane were joined by Molloy and keyboardist Bill Whelan, to record the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;The Woman I Loved So Well&quot;, at Windmill Lane Studios for two sessions: 23–29 April and 16–19 May. The album was wrapped up with a reception at Windmill Lane Studios on 9 June 1980.

The band began touring as a four-piece during the summer of 1980, playing a tour of Italian castles in July and returning to The Boys of Ballisodare Festival on 9 August, joined by Whelan and a young Cork fiddler, Nollaig Casey. Shows around this time would feature the four-piece band for the first set, with Whelan and Casey joining in for the second set. This line-up played a week of shows at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin on 18–23 August 1980, taped for a potential live album, which eventually emerged in 1987 as the unlicensed release &quot;The Best of Planxty Live&quot;. The line-up, augmented by a full orchestra and rhythm section, also recorded &quot;Timedance&quot; in 1981 as part of the Eurovision Song Contest; &quot;Timedance&quot; was the genesis for what Whelan later developed into &quot;Riverdance&quot;.

The six-piece Planxty continued to tour but began to drift apart. O’Flynn took on a project with Shaun Davey, &quot;The Brendan Voyage&quot;. Moore &amp; Lunny, eager to experiment with a rhythm section and a different, more political, song set, formed Moving Hearts. Lunny also kept busy producing albums by other artists. The original four-piece line-up played their last show together on 24 August 1982, at the National Stadium in Dublin. Nevertheless, the band (with Whelan and Casey still on board) recorded one final album at Windmill Lane Studios for the WEA label in late October and early November 1982, &quot;Words &amp; Music&quot;, which also featured contributions from fiddler James Kelly and Moving Hearts bass guitarist Eoghan O’Neill.

The divided attention of two bands proved too much and in early 1983, Lunny and Moore left to concentrate on Moving Hearts. Irvine, O’Flynn, and Whelan decided to continue as Planxty, retaining fiddler James Kelly and recruiting Arty McGlynn of County Tyrone on guitar, plus Galway’s Dolores Keane on vocals and a plethora of traditional instruments. Irvine would later dub this line-up &quot;Planxty-Too-Far&quot;, as the personnel and musical focus, now more dominated by Whelan, was far removed from the original Planxty.

A tour of Ireland in the spring of 1983, including the National Stadium in Dublin on 27 April, was the end of the group. In the words of Andy Irvine:

Although Moore, Irvine, Lunny, and O&#x27;Flynn continued to meet from time to time and perform occasionally in various combinations during professional engagements—and even play together as a foursome in the privacy of Moore&#x27;s house at least once—rumours of putative reunions circulated for over two decades.

===&quot;No Disco&quot; Documentary (2002–2003)===

In late 2002, broadcaster and journalist Leagues O&#x27;Toole was working as presenter and researcher for the RTÉ television show &quot;No Disco&quot; and persuaded the programme editor, Rory Cobbe, to develop a one-off documentary about Planxty.

O&#x27;Toole interviewed Moore, Irvine, and O&#x27;Flynn but Lunny, who was living in Japan was unavailable. After also shooting links at key landmarks from the Planxty history, the programme aired on 3 March 2003, receiving a phenomenal response from the public and very positive feedback from the Planxty members themselves. In a final comment about the constant speculation of the original line-up regrouping, Moore had said on camera: &quot;There&#x27;s nobody longs for it more than myself and the other three guys. Definitely the time is right. Let&#x27;s go for it&quot;.

===&quot;The Third Coming&quot; (2003–2005)===

On Tuesday, 7 October 2003, O&#x27;Toole received a postcard from Moore reading: &quot;There might be something of interest happening on Saturday. I&#x27;ll be in touch&quot;. It turned out that Paddy Doherty, owner of the Royal Spa Hotel in Lisdoonvarna (and co-founder of the Lisdoonvarna Music Festival), had arranged for the band&#x27;s use of the hotel&#x27;s old dining room for rehearsals, which led to a one-off concert there in front of 200 people on 11 October 2003. Moore, on stage, credited the &quot;No Disco&quot; documentary with inspiring the reunion.

Pleased with the results and the experience of playing together again, the original Planxty quartet agreed to the longed-for reunion (dubbed &quot;The Third Coming&quot;) and performed together again, on and off, for a period of just over a year.

First, they played a series of concerts at the Glór Theatre in Ennis, County Clare (on 23 &amp; 24 January 2004) and at Vicar Street in Dublin (on 30 &amp; 31 January and on 4 &amp; 5, 11 &amp; 12 February 2004), which were recorded and from which selected material was released on the CD &quot;Live 2004&quot; and its associated DVD.

In late 2004 and early 2005, another round of concerts took place at the following venues:
* Radisson SAS Hotel in Galway (6, 7 and 8 October 2004); 
* Point Theatre in Dublin (28, 29 and 30 December 2004, plus extra dates on 3, 4 and 5 January 2005);
* Waterfront Hall in Belfast (19, 20 and 21 January 2005); 
* Barbican Centre in London (29, 30 and 31 January 2005).

Planxty remained a four-piece throughout this period, with Moore occasionally playing keyboards. Since then there has been no further activity; Moore has said he would not participate in another reunion but gave his blessing to the others for the future use of the Planxty name.

===&quot;The Humours of Planxty&quot; (2006)===

Leagues O&#x27;Toole documented the history and development of the group in the biography &quot;The Humours of Planxty&quot;, which was published by Hodder Headline in 2006.

===LAPD (2012–2013)===
Friday, 20 January 2012 ushered in the inaugural gig at Dublin&#x27;s Vicar Street, of a quartet including three members of the original Planxty. They called themselves &#x27;LAPD&#x27;, after the initials of their first names: Liam O&#x27;Flynn, Andy Irvine, Paddy Glackin, and Dónal Lunny.

They played a set combining tunes and songs from the repertoires of:

* Planxty: &quot;Jenny&#x27;s Wedding/The Virginia/Garrett Barry&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Paddy Canny&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;The Starting Gate&quot;), &quot;The Jolly Beggar/The Wise Maid&quot;, &quot;Arthur MacBride&quot;, &quot;As I Roved Out (Andy)&quot;, &quot;The Blacksmith/Blacksmithereens&quot; and &quot;West Coast of Clare&quot; 
* Irvine &amp; Lunny: &quot;My Heart&#x27;s tonight in Ireland/West Clare Reel&quot;, &quot;Braes of Moneymore&quot;, &quot;Suleiman&#x27;s Kopanitsa&quot;, &quot;The Dream/Indiana&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Siún Ni Dhuibhir&quot;
* O&#x27;Flynn &amp; Glackin: &quot;Kitty&#x27;s Rambles/Humours of Ennistymon&quot;, &quot;The Green Island/Bantry Hornpipe&quot;, &quot;Young Tom Ennis/Nora Crean&quot;, &quot;A Rainy Day/The Shaskeen&quot;, &quot;Two Flings&quot;, &quot;Speed the Plough/Colonel Fraser&quot; and &quot;The Gold Ring&quot;.

In June of 2012, at a pair of concerts to mark Andy Irvine&#x27;s 70th birthday, LAPD performed two songs that had been Planxty standards, &quot;The West Coast of Clare&quot; and &quot;The Blacksmith&quot;, which were included on a subsequent live album. Paul Brady performed on the latter, making it a Planxty reunion of sorts.

LAPD performed only occasionally, to rave reviews, but never recorded before their final performance, which took place at Sligo Live, on Saturday 26 October 2013.

===Usher&#x27;s Island (2015–present day)===
When O&#x27;Flynn resigned from LAPD, Irvine, Lunny and Glackin were joined by Michael McGoldrick and John Doyle to form a new group named Usher&#x27;s Island (a reference to the Dublin quay).

==Etymology==
&quot;Planxty&quot; was a word used by people who named works by harper Turlough O&#x27;Carolan after his death, and is believed to denote a tribute to a particular person: &quot;Planxty Irwin,&quot; for example, would be in honour of Colonel John Irwin of Sligo. &quot;Planxty&quot; is thought to be a corruption of the Irish word and popular toast &quot;sláinte&quot;, meaning &quot;good health.&quot; Another possible explanation is that it is derived from the Latin &quot;planctus&quot;, a medieval lament composed in honour of a deceased person or a tragic event.

Regardless of its origin, the moniker, which replaced the provisional &quot;CLAD&quot; (Christy – Liam – Andy – Dónal), turned out to be a good fit, as O&#x27;Carolan&#x27;s music would play an important part in the band&#x27;s repertoire. (see &quot;Influences&quot;, below).

==Influences==
A formative influence on Planxty, and in particular on Moore, was the singing of Irish Traveller John &quot;Jacko&quot; Reilly who hailed from Boyle, County Roscommon. It was from Reilly that Moore learned &quot;Raggle Taggle Gypsy&quot;, which was recorded for the first Planxty album, in addition to &quot;The Well Below the Valley,&quot; which appeared on &quot;The Well Below the Valley.&quot; Moore later dipped into Reilly&#x27;s songbook again for an updated version of the lengthy ballad &quot;Lord Baker,&quot; which was featured on Planxty&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Words &amp; Music&quot;. (&quot;Baker&quot; appears to be a mondegreen for the &quot;Beichan&quot; of earlier versions.) Reilly died in 1969 at the age of 44, shortly after being found beneath his coats in the top room of his dwelling in Boyle by Tom Munnelly, who had originally collected his songs for archiving.

The music of Turlough O&#x27;Carolan appeared on a number of Planxty albums (including the B-side of their very first single), played by O&#x27;Flynn on the pipes. Much of this music first came to the attention of the band through the work of seminal Irish composer Seán Ó Riada and his group Ceoltóirí Chualann.

<text>An institution is a humanly devised structure of rules and norms that shape and constrain social behavior. All definitions of institutions generally entail that there is a level of persistence and continuity. Laws, rules, social conventions and norms are all examples of institutions. Institutions vary in their level of formality and informality.

Institutions are a principal object of study in social sciences such as political science, anthropology, economics, and sociology (the latter described by Émile Durkheim as the &quot;science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning&quot;). Primary or meta-institutions are institutions such as the family or money that are broad enough to encompass sets of related institutions. Institutions are also a central concern for law, the formal mechanism for political rule-making and enforcement. Historians study and document the founding, growth, decay and development of institutions as part of political, economic and cultural history.

==Definition==
There are a variety of definitions of the term &quot;institution&quot;. These definitions entail varying levels of formality and organizational complexity. The most expansive definitions may include informal but regularized practices, such as handshakes, whereas the most narrow definitions may only include institutions that are highly formalized (e.g. have specified laws, rules and complex organizational structures).

According to Wolfgang Streeck and Kathleen Thelen, institutions are, in the most general sense, &quot;building blocks of social order: they represent socially sanctioned, that is, collectively enforced expectations with respect to the behavior of specific categories of actors or to the performance of certain activities. Typically, they involve mutually related rights and obligations for actors.&quot; Sociologists and anthropologists have expansive definitions of institutions that include informal institutions. Political scientists have sometimes defined institutions in more formal ways where third parties must reliably and predictably enforce the rules governing the transactions of first and second parties.

One prominent Rational Choice Institutionalist definition of institutions is provided by Jack Knight who defines institutions as entailing &quot;a set of rules that structure social interactions in particular ways&quot; and that &quot;knowledge of these rules must be shared by the members of the relevant community or society.&quot; Definitions by Knight and Randall Calvert exclude purely private idiosyncrasies and conventions.

Douglass North argues that institutions are &quot;humanly devised constraints that shape interaction&quot;. According to North, they are critical determinants of economic performance, having profound effects on the costs of exchange and production. He emphasizes that small historical and cultural features can drastically change the nature of an institution. Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson agree with the analysis presented by North. They write that institutions play a crucial role in the trajectory of economic growth because economic institutions shape the opportunities and constraints of investment. Economic incentives also shape political behavior, as certain groups receive more advantages from economic outcomes than others, which allow them to gain political control. A separate paper by Acemoglu, Robinson, and Francisco A. Gallego details the relationships between institutions, human capital, and economic development. They argue that institutions set an equal playing field for competition, making institutional strength a key factor in economic growth. Authors Steven Levitsky and María Victoria Murillo claim that institutional strength depends on two factors: stability and enforcement. An unstable, unenforced institution is one where weak rules are ignored and actors are unable to make expectations based on their behavior. In a weak institution, actors cannot depend on one another to act according to the rules, which creates barriers to collective action and collaboration.

Other social scientists have examined the concept of institutional lock-in. In an article entitled &quot;Clio and the Economics of QWERTY&quot; (1985), economist Paul A. David describes technological lock-in as the process by which a specific technology dominates the market, even when the technology is not the most efficient of the ones available. He proceeds to explain that lock-in is a result of path-dependence, where the early choice of technology in a market forces other actors to choose that technology regardless of their natural preferences, causing that technology to &quot;lock-in&quot;. Economist W. Brian Arthur applied David&#x27;s theories to institutions. As with a technology, institutions (in the form of law, policy, social regulations, or otherwise) can become locked into a society, which in turn can shape social or economic development. Arthur notes that although institutional lock-in can be predictable, it is often difficult to change once it is locked-in because of its deep roots in social and economic frameworks.

Randall Calvert defines institution as &quot;an equilibrium of behavior in an underlying game.&quot; This means that &quot;it must be rational for nearly every individual to almost always adhere to the behavior prescriptions of the institution, given that nearly all other individuals are doing so.&quot;

Robert Keohane defined institutions as &quot;persistent and connected sets of rules (formal or informal) that prescribe behavioral roles, constrain activity, and shape expectations.&quot; Samuel P. Huntington defined institutions as &quot;stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior.&quot; 

Avner Greif and David Laitin define institutions &quot;as a system of human-made, nonphysical elements – norms, beliefs, organizations, and rules – exogenous to each individual whose behavior it influences that generates behavioral regularities.&quot; Additionally, they specify that organizations &quot;are institutional elements that influence the set of beliefs and norms that can be self-enforcing in the transaction under consideration. Rules are behavioral instructions that facilitate individuals with the cognitive task of choosing behavior by defining the situation and coordinating behavior.&quot;

All definitions of institutions generally entail that there is a level of persistence and continuity. Laws, rules, social conventions and norms are all examples of institutions. Organizations and institutions can be synonymous, but Jack Knight writes that organizations are a narrow version of institutions or represent a cluster of institutions; the two are distinct in the sense that organizations &quot;contain&quot; internal institutions (that govern interactions between the members of the organizations).

An informal institution tends to have socially shared rules, which are unwritten and yet are often known by all inhabitants of a certain country, as such they are often referred to as being an inherent part of the culture of a given country. Informal practices are often referred to as &quot;cultural&quot;, for example clientelism or corruption is sometimes stated as a part of the political culture in a certain place, but an informal institution itself is not cultural, it may be shaped by culture or behaviour of a given political landscape, but they should be looked at in the same way as formal institutions to understand their role in a given country. The relationship between formal and informal institutions is often closely aligned and informal institutions step in to prop up inefficient institutions. However, because they do not have a centre, which directs and coordinates their actions, changing informal institutions is a slow and lengthy process.

According to Geoffrey M. Hodgson, it is misleading to say that an institution is a form of behavior. Instead, Hodgson states that institutions are &quot;integrated systems of rules that structure social interactions.&quot;

== Examples ==

Examples of institutions include:
* Family: The family is the center of the child&#x27;s life. The family teaches children cultural values and attitudes about themselves and others – see sociology of the family. Children learn continuously from their environment. Children also become aware of class at a very early age and assign different values to each class accordingly.
* Religion: Some religion is like an ethnic or cultural category, making it less likely for the individuals to break from religious affiliations and be more socialized in this setting. Parental religious participation is the most influential part of religious socialization—more so than religious peers or religious beliefs. See sociology of religion and civil religion. 
* Peer groups: A peer group is a social group whose members have interests, social positions and age in common. This is where children can escape supervision and learn to form relationships on their own. The influence of the peer group typically peaks during adolescence however peer groups generally only affect short term interests unlike the family which has long term influence.
* Economic systems: Economic systems dictate &quot;acceptable alternatives for consumption&quot;, &quot;social values of consumption alternatives&quot;, the &quot;establishment of dominant values&quot;, and &quot;the nature of involvement in consumption&quot;. 
* Legal systems: Children are pressured from both parents and peers to conform and obey certain laws or norms of the group/community. Parents&#x27; attitudes toward legal systems influence children&#x27;s views as to what is legally acceptable. For example, children whose parents are continually in jail are more accepting of incarceration. See jurisprudence, philosophy of law, sociology of law.
* Penal systems: The penal systems acts upon prisoners and the guards. Prison is a separate environment from that of normal society; prisoners and guards form their own communities and create their own social norms. Guards serve as &quot;social control agents&quot; who discipline and provide security. From the view of the prisoners, the communities can be oppressive and domineering, causing feelings of defiance and contempt towards the guards. Because of the change in societies, prisoners experience loneliness, a lack of emotional relationships, a decrease in identity and &quot;lack of security and autonomy&quot;. Both the inmates and the guards feel tense, fearful, and defensive, which creates an uneasy atmosphere within the community. See sociology of punishment.
* Language: People learn to socialize differently depending on the specific language and culture in which they live. A specific example of this is code switching. This is where immigrant children learn to behave in accordance with the languages used in their lives: separate languages at home and in peer groups (mainly in educational settings). Depending on the language and situation at any given time, people will socialize differently. See linguistics, sociolinguistics, sociology of language.
* Mass media: The mass media are the means for delivering impersonal communications directed to a vast audience. The term &quot;media&quot; comes from Latin meaning, &quot;middle&quot;, suggesting that the media&#x27;s function is to connect people. The media can teach norms and values by way of representing symbolic reward and punishment for different kinds of behavior. Mass media has enormous effects on our attitudes and behavior, notably in regards to aggression. See media studies.
* Educational institutions – schools (preschool, primary/elementary, secondary, and post-secondary/higher –see sociology of education)
* Research community – academia and universities; research institutes – see sociology of science
* Medicine – hospitals and other health care institutions – see sociology of health and illness, medical sociology
** Psychiatric hospitals (history)
* Military or paramilitary forces – see military sociology
* Industry – businesses, including corporations – see financial institution, factory, capitalism, division of labour, social class, industrial sociology
* Civil society or NGOs – charitable organizations; advocacy groups; political parties; think tanks; virtual communities
* Gender: Through the constant interference of gender within social structures, it is observed that it constantly interacts with other social institutions (in more or less visible ways), such as race, sexuality and family.
* Video games: Video games also fall into the category of social institutions, given the fact that the complex gamer identity is seen as being at the confluence with other social institutions, such as gender and sexuality. Also, video games frequently contribute to ideological power dynamics in society by incorporating them into discourses that associate them with other phenomena, such as aggression.

In an extended context:

* Art and culture (see also: culture industry, critical theory, cultural studies, cultural sociology)
* The nation-state – Social and political scientists often speak of the state as embodying all institutions such as schools, prisons, police, and so on. However, these institutions may be considered private or autonomous, whilst organised religion and family life certainly pre-date the advent of the nation-state. The Neo-Marxist thought of Antonio Gramsci, for instance, distinguishes between institutions of political society (police, the army, the legal system., which dominate directly and coercively) and civil society (the family, education system).

==Social science perspectives==
While institutions tend to appear to people in society as part of the natural, unchanging landscape of their lives, the study of institutions by the social sciences tends to reveal the nature of institutions as social constructions, artifacts of a particular time, culture and society, produced by collective human choice, though not directly by individual intention. Sociology traditionally analyzed social institutions in terms of interlocking social roles and expectations. Social institutions created and were composed of groups of roles, or expected behaviors. The social function of the institution was executed by the fulfillment of roles. Basic biological requirements, for reproduction and care of the young, are served by the institutions of marriage and family, for example, by creating, elaborating and prescribing the behaviors expected for husband/father, wife/mother, child, etc.

The relationship of the institutions to human nature is a foundational question for the social sciences. Institutions can be seen as &quot;naturally&quot; arising from, and conforming to, human nature—a fundamentally conservative view—or institutions can be seen as artificial, almost accidental, and in need of architectural redesign, informed by expert social analysis, to better serve human needs—a fundamentally progressive view. Adam Smith anchored his economics in the supposed human &quot;propensity to truck, barter and exchange&quot;. Modern feminists have criticized traditional marriage and other institutions as element of an oppressive and obsolete patriarchy. The Marxist view—which sees human nature as historically &#x27;evolving&#x27; towards voluntary social cooperation, shared by some anarchists—is that supra-individual institutions such as the market and the state are incompatible with the individual liberty of a truly free society.

Economics, in recent years, has used game theory to study institutions from two perspectives. Firstly, how do institutions survive and evolve? In this perspective, institutions arise from Nash equilibria of games. For example, whenever people pass each other in a corridor or thoroughfare, there is a need for customs, which avoid collisions. Such a custom might call for each party to keep to their own right (or left—such a choice is arbitrary, it is only necessary that the choice be uniform and consistent). Such customs may be supposed to be the origin of rules, such as the rule, adopted in many countries, which requires driving automobiles on the right side of the road.

Secondly, how do institutions affect behaviour? In this perspective, the focus is on behaviour arising from a given set of institutional rules. In these models, institutions determine the rules (i.e. strategy sets and utility functions) of games, rather than arise as equilibria out of games. Douglass North argues, the very emergence of an institution reflects behavioral adaptations through his application of increasing returns. Over time institutions develop rules that incentivize certain behaviors over others because they present less risk or induce lower cost, and establish path dependent outcomes. For example, the Cournot duopoly model is based on an institution involving an auctioneer who sells all goods at the market-clearing price. While it is always possible to analyze behaviour with the institutions-as-equilibria approach instead, it is much more complicated.

In political science, the effect of institutions on behavior has also been considered from a meme perspective, like game theory borrowed from biology. A &quot;memetic institutionalism&quot; has been proposed, suggesting that institutions provide selection environments for political action, whereby differentiated retention arises and thereby a Darwinian evolution of institutions over time. Public choice theory, another branch of economics with a close relationship to political science, considers how government policy choices are made, and seeks to determine what the policy outputs are likely to be, given a particular political decision-making process and context. Credibility thesis purports that institutions emerge from intentional institution-building but never in the originally intended form. Instead, institutional development is endogenous and spontaneously ordered and institutional persistence can be explained by their credibility, which is provided by the function that particular institutions serve.

Political scientists have traditionally studied the causes and consequences of formal institutional design. For instance, Douglass North investigated the impact of institutions on economic development in various countries, concluding that institutions in prosperous countries like the United States induced a net increase in productivity, whereas institutions in Third World countries caused a net decrease. Scholars of this period assumed that &quot;parchment institutions&quot; that were codified as law would largely guide the behavior of individuals as intended.

On the other hand, recent scholars began to study the importance of institutional strength, which Steven Levitsky and María Victoria Murillo define in terms of the level of enforcement and sustainability of an institution. Weak institutions with low enforcement or low sustainability led to the deterioration of democratic institutions in Madagascar and the erosion of economic structures in China. Another area of interest for modern scholars is &quot;de facto&quot; (informal) institutions as opposed to &quot;de jure&quot; (formal) institutions in observing cross-country differences. For instance, Lars Feld and Stefan Voigt found that real GDP growth per capita is positively correlated with &quot;de facto&quot;, not &quot;de juri&quot;, institutions that are judicially independent. Scholars have also focused on the interaction between formal and informal institutions as well as how informal institutions may create incentives to comply with otherwise weak formal institutions. This departure from the traditional understanding of institutions reflects the scholarly recognition that a different framework of institutional analysis is necessary for studying developing economies and democracies compared to developed countries.

In history, a distinction between eras or periods, implies a major and fundamental change in the system of institutions governing a society. Political and military events are judged to be of historical significance to the extent that they are associated with changes in institutions. In European history, particular significance is attached to the long transition from the feudal institutions of the Middle Ages to the modern institutions, which govern contemporary life.

===Theories of institutional emergence===
Scholars have proposed different approaches to the emergence of institutions, such as spontaneous emergence, evolution and social contracts. In &quot;Institutions: Institutional Change and Economic Performance&quot;, Douglas North argues that institutions may be created, such as a country&#x27;s constitution; or that they may evolve over time as societies evolve. In the case of institutional evolution, it is harder to see them since societal changes happen in a slow manner, despite the perception that institutional change is rapid. Furthermore, institutions change incrementally because of how embedded they are in society. North argues that the nature of these changes is complicated process because of the changes in rules, informal constraints, and the effectiveness of enforcement of these institutions.

Levitsky and Murillo explore the way institutions are created. When it comes to institutional design, the timeframe in which these institutions are created by different actors may affect the stability the institution will have on society, because in these cases the actors may have more (or less) time to fully calculate the impacts the institution in question will have, the way the new rules affect people&#x27;s interests and their own, and the consequences of the creation of a new institution will have in society. Scholars like Christopher Kingston and Gonzalo Caballero also pose the importance of gradual societal change in the emergence of brand new institutions: these changes will determine which institutions will be successful in surviving, spreading, and becoming successful. The decisions actors within a society make also have lot to do in the survival and eventual evolution of an institution: they foster groups who want to maintain the set of rules of the game (as described by North), keeping a status quo impeding institutional change. People&#x27;s interests play an important role in determining the direction of institutional change and emergence.

Some scholars argue that institutions can emerge spontaneously without intent as individuals and groups converge on a particular institutional arrangement. Other approaches see institutional development as the result of evolutionary or learning processes. For instance, Pavlović explores the way compliance and socio-economic conditions in a consolidated democratic state are important in the emergence of institutions and the compliance power they have for the rules imposed. In his work, he explains the difference between wealthy societies and non-wealthy societies; wealthy societies on one hand often have institutions that have been functioning for a while, but also have a stable economy and economic development that has a direct effect in the society&#x27;s democratic stability. He presents us with three scenarios in which institutions may thrive in poor societies with no democratic background. First, if electoral institutions guarantee multiple elections that are widely accepted; second, if military power is in evenly equilibrium; and third, if this institutions allow for different actors to come to power.

Other scholars see institutions as being formed through social contracts or rational purposeful designs.

===Theories of institutional change===

Origin of institutional theory

John Meyer and Brian Rowan were the first scholars to introduce institutional theory to inspect how organizations are shaped by their social and political environments and how they evolve in different ways. Other scholars like Paul DiMaggio and Walter Powell proposed one of the forms of institutional change shortly after: institutional isomorphism. There were three main proposals. The first one is the coercive process where organizations adopt changes consistent with their larger institution due to pressures from other organizations which they might depend on or be regulated by.
Such examples include state mandates or supplier demands. The second one is the mimetic process where organizations adopt other organizations&#x27; practices to resolve internal uncertainty about their own actions or strategy. Lastly, it is the normative pressure where organizations adopt changes related to the professional environment like corporate changes or cultural changes in order to be consistent.

In order to understand why some institutions persist and other institutions only appear in certain contexts, it is important to understand what drives institutional change.
Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson assert that institutional change is endogenous. They posit a framework for institutional change that is rooted in the distribution of resources across society and preexisting political institutions. These two factors determine de jure and de facto political power, respectively, which in turn defines this period&#x27;s economic institutions and the next period&#x27;s political institutions. Finally, the current economic institutions determine next period&#x27;s distribution of resources and the cycle repeats. Douglass North attributes institutional change to the work of &quot;political entrepreneurs&quot;, who see personal opportunities to be derived from a changed institutional framework. These entrepreneurs weigh the expected costs of altering the institutional framework against the benefits they can derive from the change. North describes the institutional change as a process that is extremely incremental, and that works through both formal and informal institutions. North also proposes that institutional change, inefficiencies, and economic stagnation can be attributed to the differences between institutions and organizations. This is because organizations are created to take advantage of the opportunities created by institutions and, as organizations evolve, these institutions are then altered. Overall, according to North, this institutional change would then be shaped by a lock-in symbiotic relationship between institutions and organizations and a feedback process by which the people in a society may perceive and react to these changes. Lipscomb argues that patterns of institutional change vary according to underlying characteristics of issue areas, such as network effects. North also offers an efficiency hypothesis, stating that relative price changes create incentives to create more efficient institutions. It is a utilitarian argument that assumes institutions will evolve to maximize overall welfare for economic efficiency.

Contrastingly, in &quot;Variation in Institutional Strength&quot;, Levitksy and Murillo acknowledge that some formal institutions are &quot;born weak,&quot; and attribute this to the actors creating them. They argue that the strength of institutions relies on the enforcement of laws and stability, which many actors are either uninterested in or incapable of supporting. Similarly, Brian Arthur refers to these factors as properties of non-predictability and potential inefficiency in matters where increasing returns occur naturally in economics. According to Mansfield and Snyder, many transitional democracies lack state institutions that are strong and coherent enough to regulate mass political competition. According to Huntington, the countries with ineffective or weak institutions often have a gap between high levels of political participation and weak political institutions, which may provoke nationalism in democratizing countries. Regardless of whether the lack of enforcement and stability in institutions is intentional or not, weakly enforced institutions can create lasting ripples in a society and their way of functioning. Good enforcement of laws can be classified as a system of rules that are complied with in practice and has a high risk of punishment. It is essential because it will create a slippery slope effect on most laws and transform the nature of once-effective institutions.

Many may identify the creation of these formal institutions as a fitting way for agents to establish legitimacy in an international or domestic domain, a phenomenon identified by DiMaggio and Powell and Meyer and Rowan as &quot;isomorphism&quot; and that Levitsky and Murillo liken to window dressing. They describe the developing world institutions as &quot;window-dressing institutions&quot; that &quot;are often a response to international demands or expectations.&quot; It also provides an effective metaphor for something that power holders have an interest in keeping on the books, but no interest in enforcing.

The dependence developing countries have on international assistance for loans or political power creates incentives for state elites to establish a superficial form of Western government but with malfunctioning institutions.

In a 2020 study, Johannes Gerschewski created a two-by-two typology of institutional change depending on the sources of change (exogenous or endogenous) and the time horizon of change (short or long). In another 2020 study, Erik Voeten created a two-by-two typology of institutional design depending on whether actors have full agency or are bound by structures, and whether institutional designs reflect historical processes or are optimal equilibriums.

Institutions and economic development
In the context of institutions and how they are formed, North suggests that institutions ultimately work to provide social structure in society and to incentivize individuals who abide by this structure. North explains that there is in fact a difference between institutions and organizations and that organizations are &quot;groups of people bound by some common purpose to achieve objectives.&quot; Additionally, because institutions serve as an umbrella for smaller groups such as organizations, North discusses the impact of institutional change and the ways in which it can cause economic performance to decline or become better depending on the occurrence. This is known as &quot;path dependence&quot; which North explains is the idea of historical and cultural events impacting the development of institutions over time. Even though North argues that institutions due to their structure do not possess the ability to change drastically, path dependence and small differences have the ability to cause change over a long period of time. For example, Levitsky and Murillo stress the importance of institutional strength in their article &quot;Variation in Institutional Strength.&quot; They suggest that in order for an institution to maintain strength and resistance there must be legitimacy within the different political regimes, variation in political power, and political autonomy within a country. Legitimacy allows for there to be an incentive to comply with institutional rules and conditions, leading to a more effective institution. With political power, its centralization within a small group of individual leaders makes it easier and more effective to create rules and run an institution smoothly. However, it can be abused by individual leaders which is something that can contribute to the weakening of an institution over time. Lastly, independence within an institution is vital because the institutions are making decisions based on expertise and norms that they have created and built over time rather than considerations from other groups or institutions. Having the ability to operate as an independent institution is crucial for its strength and resistance over time. An example of the importance of institutional strength can be found in Lacatus&#x27; essay on national human rights institutions in Europe, where she states that &quot;As countries become members of GANHRI, their NHRIs are more
likely to become stronger over time and show a general pattern of isomorphism regarding stronger safeguards for durability.&quot; This demonstrates that institutions running independently and further creating spaces for the formation of smaller groups with other goals and objectives is crucial for an institution&#x27;s survival.

Additionally, technological developments are important in the economic development of an institution. As detailed by Brian Arthur in &quot;Competing Technologies, Increasing Returns, and Lock-in by Historical Events&quot;, technological advancements play a crucial role in shaping the economic stability of an institution. He talks about the &quot;lock-in&quot; phenomenon in which adds a lot of value to a piece of technology that is used by many people. It is important for policymakers and people of higher levels within an institution to consider when looking at products that have a long term impact on markets and economic developments and stability. For example, recently the EU has banned TikTok from official devices across all three government institutions. This was due to &quot;cybersecurity concerns&quot; and data protection in regards to data collection by &quot;third parties.&quot; This concern regarding TikTok&#x27;s growing popularity demonstrates the importance of technological development within an institutional economy. Without understanding of what these products are doing or selling to the consumers, there runs a risk of it weakening an institution and causing more harm than good if not carefully considered and examined by the individual actors within an institution. This can also be seen in the recent issue with Silvergate and money being moved to crypto exchanges under the SEN Platform institution, which has led the bank to &quot;delay the filing of its annual report due to questions from its auditors.&quot; Additionally, they lost many crypto clients the next day allowing the bank&#x27;s stock price to fall by 60% before it stabilized again. These examples demonstrate the ways in which institutions and the economy interact, and how the well-being of the economy is essential for the institution&#x27;s success and ability to run smoothly.

====Institutional persistence====
North argues that because of the preexisting influence that existing organizations have over the existing framework, change that is brought about is often in the interests of these organizations. This is because organizations are created to take advantage of such opportunities and, as organizations evolve, these institutions are altered.

This produces a phenomenon called path dependence, which states that institutional patterns are persistent and endure over time. These paths are determined at critical junctures, analogous to a fork in the road, whose outcome leads to a narrowing of possible future outcomes. Once a choice is made during a critical juncture, it becomes progressively difficult to return to the initial point where the choice was made. James Mahoney studies path dependence in the context of national regime change in Central America and finds that liberal policy choices of Central American leaders in the 19th century was the critical juncture that led to the divergent levels of development that we see in these countries today. The policy choices that leaders made in the context of liberal reform policy led to a variety of self-reinforcing institutions that created divergent development outcomes for the Central American countries.

Though institutions are persistent, North states that paths can change course when external forces weaken the power of an existing organization. This allows other entrepreneurs to affect change in the institutional framework. This change can also occur as a result of gridlock between political actors produced by a lack of mediating institutions and an inability to reach a bargain. Artificial implementation of institutional change has been tested in political development but can have unintended consequences. North, Wallis, and Weingast divide societies into different social orders: open access orders, which about a dozen developed countries fall into today, and limited access orders, which accounts for the rest of the countries. Open access orders and limited access orders differ fundamentally in the way power and influence is distributed. As a result, open access institutions placed in limited access orders face limited success and are often coopted by the powerful elite for self-enrichment. Transition to more democratic institutions is not created simply by transplanting these institutions into new contexts, but happens when it is in the interest of the dominant coalition to widen access.

====Natural selection====
Ian Lustick suggests that the social sciences, particularly those with the institution as a central concept, can benefit by applying the concept of natural selection to the study of how institutions change over time. By viewing institutions as existing within a fitness landscape, Lustick argues that the gradual improvements typical of many institutions can be seen as analogous to hill-climbing within one of these fitness landscapes. This can eventually lead to institutions becoming stuck on local maxima, such that for the institution to improve any further, it would first need to decrease its overall fitness score (e.g., adopt policies that may cause short-term harm to the institution&#x27;s members). The tendency to get stuck on local maxima can explain why certain types of institutions may continue to have policies that are harmful to its members or to the institution itself, even when members and leadership are all aware of the faults of these policies.

As an example, Lustick cites Amyx&#x27;s analysis of the gradual rise of the Japanese economy and its seemingly sudden reversal in the so-called &quot;Lost Decade&quot;. According to Amyx, Japanese experts were not unaware of the possible causes of Japan&#x27;s economic decline. Rather, to return Japan&#x27;s economy back to the path to economic prosperity, policymakers would have had to adopt policies that would first cause short-term harm to the Japanese people and government. Under this analysis, says Ian Lustick, Japan was stuck on a &quot;local maxima&quot;, which it arrived at through gradual increases in its fitness level, set by the economic landscape of the 1970s and 80s. Without an accompanying change in institutional flexibility, Japan was unable to adapt to changing conditions, and even though experts may have known which changes the country needed, they would have been virtually powerless to enact those changes without instituting unpopular policies that would have been harmful in the short-term.

The lessons from Lustick&#x27;s analysis applied to Sweden&#x27;s economic situation can similarly apply to the political gridlock that often characterizes politics in the United States. For example, Lustick observes that any politician who hopes to run for elected office stands very little to no chance if they enact policies that show no short-term results. There is a mismatch between policies that bring about short-term benefits with minimal sacrifice, and those that bring about long-lasting change by encouraging institution-level adaptations.

There are some criticisms to Lustick&#x27;s application of natural selection theory to institutional change. Lustick himself notes that identifying the inability of institutions to adapt as a symptom of being stuck on a local maxima within a fitness landscape does nothing to solve the problem. At the very least, however, it might add credibility to the idea that truly beneficial change might require short-term harm to institutions and their members. David Sloan Wilson notes that Lustick needs to more carefully distinguish between two concepts: multilevel selection theory and evolution on multi-peaked landscapes. Bradley Thayer points out that the concept of a fitness landscape and local maxima only makes sense if one institution can be said to be &quot;better&quot; than another, and this in turn only makes sense insofar as there exists some objective measure of an institution&#x27;s quality. This may be relatively simple in evaluating the economic prosperity of a society, for example, but it is difficult to see how objectively a measure can be applied to the amount of freedom of a society, or the quality of life of the individuals within.

==Institutionalization==

The term &quot;institutionalization&quot; is widely used in social theory to refer to the process of embedding something (for example a concept, a social role, a particular value or mode of behavior) within an organization, social system, or society as a whole. The term may also be used to refer to committing a particular individual to an institution, such as a mental institution. To this extent, &quot;institutionalization&quot; may carry negative connotations regarding the treatment of, and damage caused to, vulnerable human beings by the oppressive or corrupt application of inflexible systems of social, medical, or legal controls by publicly owned, private or not-for-profit organizations.

The term &quot;institutionalization&quot; may also be used in a political sense to apply to the creation or organization of governmental institutions or particular bodies responsible for overseeing or implementing policy, for example in the welfare or development.

<text>Commercial Album is the seventh studio album released by art rock group the Residents in 1980. It is commonly considered a follow-up to their 1978 album &quot;Duck Stab/Buster &amp; Glen&quot;, in that it retains the former album&#x27;s pop-oriented song structures. The album contains 40 songs, each lasting exactly one minute - a deliberate allusion to Top 40 mainstream radio. The album&#x27;s liner notes state that, to form a complete pop song, tracks from the album should be played three times in a row.

The album features a number of guest musicians, notably drummer Chris Cutler and guitarist Fred Frith of the recently disbanded Henry Cow. The credits mention Frith as an &quot;Extra-Hard Working Guest Musician.&quot; Frith told author Cole Gagne that he recorded parts for around 25 tracks and was later told by a band member that he appeared on at least 15 of the released cuts, but that he could only identify himself on three tracks where he played bass. Other guests are credited under pseudonyms, such as Andy Partridge of XTC (as &quot;Sandy Sandwich&quot;) and Lene Lovich (as &quot;Mud&#x27;s Sis&quot;); Brian Eno and David Byrne appear on the album uncredited.

As a promotional stunt, the Residents purchased 40 one-minute advertising slots on San Francisco&#x27;s most popular Top 40 radio station at the time, KFRC, such that the station played each track on the album over the course of three days. This prompted an editorial in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine questioning whether the act was art or advertising.

== Track listing ==
All tracks last exactly one minute, but with a three-second pause between songs making each last around 1:03. On the original LP, &quot;Die in Terror&quot; is incorrectly printed as track 14, between &quot;The Nameless Souls&quot; and &quot;Love Leaks Out&quot;.

=== 1988 CD bonus tracks ===
* Tracks 41 and 42 are outtakes from the album, released separately as the &quot;Commercial Single&quot;.
* Track 44 was recorded for the 1980 Morgan Fisher project &quot;Miniatures&quot;.
* Tracks 45–48 were previously released on the 1983 compilation &quot;Residue&quot;.
* Track 49 was previously released as a single in 1984.
* Track 50 was previously released as a single in 1987.

=== 2019 pREServed edition bonus tracks ===
After a small bit of silence, an unlisted track plays, a &quot;concentrate&quot; mix of the advertisements that were aired in promotion of the album on KFRC.

<text>A Bond girl is a character who is a love interest, female companion or (occasionally) an adversary of James Bond in a novel, film, or video game. Bond girls occasionally have names that are double entendres or sexual puns, such as Plenty O&#x27;Toole, Holly Goodhead, or Xenia Onatopp. The female leads in the films, such as Ursula Andress, Honor Blackman, or Eva Green, can also be referred to as &quot;Bond girls&quot;. The term &quot;Bond girl&quot; may also be considered as an anachronism, with some female cast members in the films preferring the designation &quot;Bond woman&quot;.

==In novels==

Nearly all of Ian Fleming&#x27;s Bond novels and short stories include one or more female characters who can be said to qualify as Bond girls, most of whom have been adapted for the screen. While Fleming&#x27;s Bond girls have some individual traits (at least in their literary forms), they also have a great many characteristics in common. One of these is age: The typical Bond girl is in her early to mid-twenties, roughly ten years younger than Bond, who seems to be perennially in his mid-thirties. Examples include Solitaire (25), Tatiana Romanova (24), Vivienne &quot;Viv&quot; Michel (23), and Kissy Suzuki (23). The youngest Bond girl (though she and Bond do not sleep together) may be Gala Brand; she is named for the cruiser in which her father is serving at the time of her birth. Bond&#x27;s youngest sexual partner in the books is Mariko Ichiban, an 18-year-old masseuse in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. The eldest Bond girls are Pussy Galore, who Bond speculates is in her early 30s, and 29-year-old Domino Vitali.

Bond girls conform to a fairly well-defined standard of beauty. They possess splendid figures and tend to dress in a slightly masculine, assertive fashion, wear little jewellery—and that in a masculine cut—wide leather belts, and square-toed leather shoes. (There is some variation in dress, though: Bond girls have made their initial appearances in evening wear, in bra and panties and, on occasion, naked.) Most are white; they often sport light though noticeable suntans (although a few, such as Solitaire, Tatiana Romanova, and Pussy Galore, are not only tanless but remarkably pale), and they generally use little or no makeup and no nail polish, also wearing their nails short. Their hair may be any colour, though they typically wear it in a natural or casual cut that falls heavily to their shoulders. Their features, especially their eyes and mouths, are often widely spaced (e.g. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tiffany Case, Tatiana Romanova, Honey Ryder, Viv Michel, Mary Goodnight). Their eyes are usually blue (e.g. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Honey Ryder, Tracy Bond, Mary Goodnight), and sometimes this is true to an unusual and striking degree: Tiffany Case&#x27;s eyes are chatoyant, varying with the light from grey to grey-blue, while Pussy Galore has deep violet eyes, the only truly violet eyes that Bond had ever seen. The first description of a Bond girl, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;″s Vesper Lynd, is almost a template for the typical dress as well as the general appearance of later Bond girls; she sports nearly all of the features discussed above. In contrast, Dominetta &quot;Domino&quot; Vitali arguably departs to the greatest degree from the template, dressing in white leather doeskin sandals, appearing more tanned, sporting a soft Brigitte Bardot haircut, and giving no indication of widely spaced features. (The departure may be due to the unusual circumstances behind the writing of the novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;, in which Domino appears.) Even Domino, however, wears rather masculine jewellery.

The best-known characteristic of Bond girls, apart from their uniform beauty, is their pattern of sexually suggestive names, such as Pussy Galore. Names with less obvious meanings are sometimes explained in the novels. While Solitaire&#x27;s real name is Simone Latrelle, she is known as Solitaire because she excludes men from her life; Gala Brand, as noted above, is named for her father&#x27;s cruiser, HMS &quot;Galatea&quot;; and Tiffany Case received her name from her father, who was so angry that she was not a boy that he gave her mother a thousand dollars and a compact from Tiffany&#x27;s and then walked out on her. Fleming&#x27;s penchant for double-entendre names began with the first Bond novel &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Conjecture is widespread that the name of the Bond girl in that novel, &quot;Vesper Lynd,&quot; was intended to be a pun on &quot;West Berlin,&quot; signifying Vesper&#x27;s divided loyalties as a double agent under Soviet control. Several Bond girls, however, have normal names (e.g. Mary Ann Russell, Judy Havelock, Viv Michel, Tracy Bond (née Teresa Draco, aka Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo).

Most Bond girls are apparently (and sometimes expressly) sexually experienced by the time they meet Bond. Quite often those previous experiences have not been positive, and many Bond girls have had sexual violence inflicted on them in the past, causing them to feel alienated from all men—until Bond comes along. Tiffany Case was gang-raped as a teenager; Honey Ryder was beaten and raped as a teenager by a drunken acquaintance. Pussy Galore was sexually abused at age 12 by her uncle. While there is no such clear-cut trauma in Solitaire&#x27;s early life, there are suggestions that she, too, avoids men because of their unwanted sexual advances in her past. Kissy Suzuki reports to Bond that during her brief career in Hollywood, when she was 17, &quot;They thought that because I am Japanese I am some sort of an animal and that my body is for everyone.&quot; The implication is often that these violent episodes have turned these Bond girls against men, though upon encountering Bond they overcome their earlier antipathy and sleep with him not only willingly but eagerly. This trope reaches an extreme level in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, where Pussy Galore is portrayed as a lesbian when she first meets Bond, but at the end of the novel she sleeps with him. When, in bed, he says to her, &quot;They told me you only liked women,&quot; she replies, &quot;I never met a man before.&quot;

In Fleming&#x27;s novels, many Bond girls have some sort of independent job or even career, often one that was considered inappropriate for women in the 1950s. Lynd, Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Mary Ann Russell, and Mary Goodnight are in intelligence or law-enforcement work. Those who are criminals, such as Case and Galore, tend to be similarly independent-minded in how they approach their work—the latter even running her own syndicate. Even those Bond girls who have more conventional or glamorous jobs show themselves to be invested in having an independent outlook on life. While the Bond girls are clearly intended as sex objects, they are nevertheless portrayed in the novels as having a high degree of independence; this is also frequently (but not always) the case in the films.

Most of the novels focus on one particular romance, as some of them do not begin until well into the novel (&quot;Casino Royale&quot; is a good example). However, several exceptions have been made: In &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, the Masterton sisters are considered Bond girls (although Tilly is supposedly a lesbian), and after their deaths, Pussy Galore (also supposedly a lesbian) becomes the primary Bond girl. In &quot;Thunderball&quot;, Bond romances first Patricia Fearing, then later Domino Vitali. In &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, Bond enters into a relationship and an eventual marriage with Teresa &quot;Tracy&quot; di Vicenzo, and sleeps with Ruby Windsor, a patient he meets in Blofeld&#x27;s hideout while posing as a genealogist. In &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, Bond mainly has a relationship with Kissy Suzuki, but also romances Mariko Ichiban, as well as another girl.

Several Bond girls have obvious signs of inner turmoil (Vesper Lynd or Vivienne Michel), and others have traumatic pasts. Most Bond girls whose characters are allowed to develop in the course of the story are flawed, and several have unhappy sexual backgrounds (Ryder, Galore, Case, Michel, and Suzuki, among others).

===Inspiration===
The inspiration for all of Fleming&#x27;s Bond girls may be his onetime lover Muriel Wright, who according to &quot;The Times&quot;:

Wright was 26 and &quot;exceptionally beautiful&quot; when she and Fleming met in 1935. A talented rider, skier, and polo player, Wright was independently wealthy and a model. She was devoted to Fleming, despite his repeated unfaithfulness. She died in an air raid in 1944, devastating Fleming, who called Wright &quot;too good to be true&quot;.

==In film==

Ursula Andress (as Honey Ryder) in &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962) is widely regarded as the first Bond girl, although she was preceded by both Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench and Zena Marshall as Miss Taro in the same film. &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), the third, established the Bond girl as regularly appearing in Bond films.

There is no set rule on what kind of person a Bond girl will be or what role she will play. She may be an ally or an enemy of Bond, pivotal to the mission or simply there for her looks. There are female characters such as Judi Dench&#x27;s M, Camille Montes, a Bolivian intelligence agent who teams up with Bond in &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, and Bibi Dahl in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, who are not romantic interests of Bond, and hence may not be considered Bond girls. It has been argued that M&#x27;s pivotal role in the plot of &quot;Skyfall&quot; qualifies her as a Bond girl or Bond woman.

There have been many attempts to break down the numerous Bond girls into a top 10 list for the entire series; characters who often appear in these lists include Anya Amasova (from &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, portrayed by Barbara Bach); Pussy Galore (from &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, portrayed by Honor Blackman); Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo (from &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, portrayed by Diana Rigg); and often ranked Number 1 on the list, Honey Ryder (from &quot;Dr. No&quot;, portrayed by Ursula Andress). &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put &quot;Bond bathing suits&quot; on its 2009 end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;And you thought spies were supposed to be inconspicuous! Halle Berry&#x27;s orange bikini in &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002) and Daniel Craig&#x27;s supersnug powder blue trunks in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006) suggest that neither 007 star can keep a secret.&quot;

Monica Bellucci in &quot;Spectre&quot; became the oldest Bond girl at the age of 50, although she stated that she does not consider herself to be a &quot;Bond girl&quot;, but a &quot;Bond woman&quot;.

===Roles and impact===
Roald Dahl said that when writing the script for &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, he was advised to use three Bond girls: The first should die &quot;preferably in Bond&#x27;s arms&quot; early, the second a villain whom Bond seduces before she dies in an unusual and gory way midway, and the third survives to the end of the film. In several, the Bond girl is revealed, after her tryst with Bond, to be a villainess. Examples are Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera) in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983), Elektra King (Sophie Marceau) in &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (1999), and Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike) in &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002). The Dalton films of the 1980s introduced the &quot;Bond woman&quot;, who is equal to and challenges Bond, but he remains the heterosexual hero; they are depicted with Dalton and later Bonds and their cars and gadgets, implying that all are possessions that Bond can use and dispose.

As of 2013, there had been only two films in which James Bond falls in love with the Bond girl. The first was &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969), in which Countess Tracy di Vicenzo (Diana Rigg) marries Bond but is shot dead by Irma Bunt and Ernst Stavro Blofeld at the story&#x27;s end. The second was Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006). Bond confesses his love to her and resigns from MI6 so that they can have a normal life together. He later learns that she had been a double agent working for his enemies. The enemy organisation Quantum had kidnapped her former lover and had been blackmailing her to secure her co-operation. She ends up actually falling in love with Bond, but dies, as Quantum is closing in on her, by drowning in a lift in a building under renovation in Venice.

With the exception of these two doomed Bond girls, it is never explained why Bond&#x27;s love interest in one film is gone by the next, and is never mentioned or even alluded to again. This is not always the case in the novels, which do sometimes make references to the Bond girls who have appeared in previous books. Tiffany Case and Honey Ryder are revealed to have married other men (in &quot;From Russia With Love&quot; and &quot;The Man With the Golden Gun&quot; respectively), and in &quot;Doctor No&quot;, Bond briefly wonders about Solitaire. In John Gardner&#x27;s novels continuing the franchise Bond girls begin to appear in more than one book, often picking up their relationships with Bond from before, and in one case continuing a romance through two consecutive titles. In &quot;Licence Renewed&quot; it is specifically noted in an epilogue that Bond and Lavender Peacock stopped seeing each other after a brief romance, but Sukie Tempesta (&quot;Nobody Lives for Ever&quot;), Beatrice Maria da Ricci (&quot;Win, Lose or Die&quot;), and Fredericka von Grüsse (&quot;Never Send Flowers&quot;) all make return appearances in later books. Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s &quot;Trigger Mortis&quot; picks up two weeks after the events in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; with Bond continuing his relationship with Pussy Galore. A unique case is Mary Goodnight, who appears in the novels &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; and &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; as Bond&#x27;s secretary, before becoming a full-fledged Bond girl in &quot;The Man With the Golden Gun&quot;.

===Effect on career===
The role of a Bond girl, as it has evolved in the films, is typically a high-profile part that can sometimes give a major boost to the career of unestablished actresses, although a number of Bond girls were well-established beforehand. For instance, Diana Rigg and Honor Blackman were both cast as Bond girls after they had already become stars in the United Kingdom for their roles in the television series &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Teri Hatcher was already known for her role as Lois Lane in the television series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; before she was cast in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. A few years after playing a Bond girl, she became one of the most highly paid actresses on television, starring in &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. 
Broccoli&#x27;s original choice for the role of Domino Derval was Julie Christie following her performance in &quot;Billy Liar&quot; in 1963. It seems he was disappointed when he met her so instead he considered Raquel Welch after seeing her on the cover of the October 1964 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Welch, however, was hired by Richard Zanuck of 20th Century Fox to appear in the film &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; the same year instead. French actress Claudine Auger was ultimately cast in the role. &quot;Thunderball&quot; launched Auger into a successful European film career but did little for her in the United States.

The producers encountered difficulty in casting the female lead in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006), due to the perception among many leading actresses that appearing in a James Bond film could hinder their careers. Catherine Zeta Jones was one of several actresses who declined a role in the film. However, there is plenty of evidence to the contrary, with several former Bond girls going on to have very high profile acting careers. Of the earlier actresses, Ursula Andress and Honor Blackman both had well regarded careers, and Jane Seymour—who was an unknown when she was cast in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (the opening credits read &quot;Introducing Jane Seymour&quot;)—later won an Emmy Award for playing Maria Callas in a TV movie and then became a household name playing the title role in her TV series &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;. Since Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli took over producing the films in the mid-1990s, several actresses have also won or been nominated for an Oscar: Kim Basinger in 1998 (Best Supporting Actress), Halle Berry in 2002 (who won Best Actress while she was filming &quot;Die Another Day&quot;), Rosamund Pike (nominated for Best Actress in 2015), and Michelle Yeoh in 2023 (Best Actress). Ultimately, the up-and-coming actress Eva Green was cast as Vesper Lynd, and won BAFTA&#x27;s Rising Star Award for her performance.

===Multiple appearances===
Prior to the series being rebooted in 2006 with &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, Sylvia Trench was the only Bond girl character to appear in more than one film (&quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1962 and &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; in 1963). She was meant to be Bond&#x27;s regular girlfriend, but was dropped after her appearance in the second film. After the series was rebooted, Moneypenny was re-introduced in &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012) as an agent assisting Bond in his mission and her characterisation was closer to that of a Bond girl; following her demotion at the end of &quot;Skyfall&quot;, the character returned for the next film, &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015), as M&#x27;s personal assistant, and the characterisation of Moneypenny was closer to that of the original series. Léa Seydoux, who played Madeleine Swann in &quot;Spectre&quot;, reprised her role in &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021).

In the Eon series, three actresses have made reappearances as different Bond girls: Martine Beswick and Nadja Regin both first appeared in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, and then appeared in &quot;Thunderball&quot; and &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, respectively. Maud Adams played Andrea Anders in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974) and the eponymous character in &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983).

If the non-Eon produced films, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967) and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983), are included, several other actresses have also been a Bond girl more than once: Ursula Andress in &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962) and &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967); Angela Scoular in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969) and &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967); Valerie Leon in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977) and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;.

==List of Bond girls==
===Ian Fleming stories===
Mary Goodnight was a supporting character in several Bond novels before graduating to full Bond girl in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. Several short stories, such as &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;, &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, and &quot;The Property of a Lady&quot;, feature female characters in prominent roles, but none of these women interact with Bond in a romantic way.

===Post-Fleming stories===
===Eon Productions films===
There are several different archetypes for Bond girls: romantic interests, those who assist him, femme fatales (who invariably make an attempt on Bond&#x27;s life), and sacrificial lambs (female allies or associates of Bond who wind up dead). Since it is debatable whether certain girls fulfil certain tropes (e.g. If Bond kisses a girl, does that make her a romantic interest? Is Pussy Galore a &quot;femme fatale&quot; due to her being in league with Goldfinger?), the following criteria are used for determining inclusion: romantic interests have (implied) sexual encounters with Bond; those women who have a principal role in assisting Bond; femme fatales attempt to kill Bond; sacrificial lambs have an allegiance to Bond whose death is instigated by the main villain or his henchmen.

===Non-Eon films===
In addition to the Eon Productions films, there have been two Bond films produced by independent studios and one television production. The roles are not as easily categorized.


===Video games===
==Documentary==
In 2002, former Bond girl Maryam d&#x27;Abo co-wrote the book &quot;Bond Girls Are Forever: The Women of James Bond&quot;. This book later became a DVD exclusive documentary featuring d&#x27;Abo and other Bond girls, including Ursula Andress. In some locations, the documentary was released as a gift with the purchase of &quot;Die Another Day&quot; on DVD. The featurette was included on the DVD release of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (2006).

<text>Pechenga (; Finnish and ; ; ; ) is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) in Pechengsky District, Murmansk Oblast, Russia. Municipally, it is incorporated as Pechenga Urban Settlement of Pechengsky Municipal District. Population: 

==History==
The Pechenga area has been indigenously inhabited by the Finnic Kvens and the Sami. 

The settlement was founded by Russians as the Pechenga Monastery in 1533 at the influx of the Pechenga River into the Barents Sea, 135 km west of modern Murmansk. St. Tryphon of Pechenga, a monk from Novgorod is considered to be the founder of Pechenga Monastery. In 1533, the area became part of Russia. 

Inspired by the model of the Solovki, Tryphon wished to convert the local Sami population to Christianity and to demonstrate how faith could flourish in the most inhospitable lands. His example was eagerly followed by other Russian monks. By 1572, the Pechenga Monastery counted about 50 brethren and 200 lay followers. Six years after Tryphon&#x27;s death in 1583, the wooden monastery was raided and burnt down by the Swedes. It is said that the raid claimed the lives of 51 monks and 65 lay brothers. The monastery was moved closer to the Norwegian border. It was destroyed in 1764, but restored in 1880, and exists to this day.

During the state of war between Finland and Soviet Russia (1918–1920) the area around Pechenga was disputed by British, Bolshevik and Finnish forces, and as a result of the Treaty of Tartu in 1920 became a part of Finland as Petsamo. Nickel was discovered in 1921 and began to be exploited commercially in 1935. The area was captured by the Soviets during the Winter War in 1940 but returned to Finland at the conclusion of the war. During the Second World War, between 1941 through 1944, Petsamo was used as a staging post for attacks on Murmansk by Finland and Germany. Aircraft from the British aircraft carrier attacked the port on 30 July 1941. The area was captured by the Red Army during the Petsamo–Kirkenes Offensive in 1944 and in 1947, after the subsequent Paris Peace Treaty, incorporated into the Soviet Union.

After the war the area was a military zone due to its proximity to the Norwegian border. Nickel mining has led to ecological problems in the area.

The 200th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade is stationed at the settlement.

<text>The Port of London is that part of the River Thames in England lying between Teddington Lock and the defined boundary (since 1968, a line drawn from Foulness Point in Essex via Gunfleet Old Lighthouse to Warden Point in Kent) with the North Sea and including any associated docks. Once the largest port in the world, it was the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest port as of 2020. Usage is largely governed by the Port of London Authority (&quot;PLA&quot;), a public trust established in 1908; while mainly responsible for coordination and enforcement of activities, it also has some minor operations of its own.

The port can handle cruise liners, roll-on roll-off ferries and cargo of all types at the larger facilities in its eastern extent. As with many similar historic European ports, such as Antwerp and Rotterdam, many activities have steadily moved downstream towards the open sea as ships have grown larger and the land upriver taken over for other uses.

==History==
The Port of London has been central to the economy of London since the founding of the city in the 1st century and was a major contributor to the growth and success of the city. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it was the busiest port in the world, with wharves extending continuously along the Thames for , and over 1,500 cranes handling 60,000 ships per year. It was a prime target for Nazi German bomber aircraft during World War II (the Blitz).

===The Roman port in London===

The first evidence of a reasonable sized trading in London can be seen during Roman control of Britain, at which time the Romans built the original harbour. The construction involved expanding the waterfront using wooden frames filled with dirt. Once these were in place, the wharf was built in four stages moving downstream from London Bridge. The port began to rapidly grow and prosper during the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and saw its final demise in the early 5th century with the decline in trade activity due to the Roman departure from Britain. The changes made to the banks along the port made by the Romans are so substantial and long-lasting that it was hard to tell where the natural waterfront really began. However, the harbour within the Roman town was already in decline at the end of the 2nd century AD. It seems likely that a proper port developed at about this time at Shadwell, about east of the Roman town 

London became a very important trading port for the Romans at its height in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The harbour town grew and expanded quickly. The lavish nature of goods traded in London shaped the extravagant lifestyle of its citizens and the city flourished under Roman colonization. The Roman expansion of port facilities and organisation of the London harbour have remained as the base of the London harbour.

===Pool of London===
Until the beginning of the 19th century, shipping was handled entirely within the Pool of London on the stretch of the River Thames along Billingsgate on the south side of the City of London. All imported cargoes had to be delivered for inspection and assessment by Customs Officers, giving the area the name of &quot;Legal Quays&quot;. The Pool saw a phenomenal increase in both overseas and coastal trade in the second half of the 18th century. Two-thirds of coastal vessels using the Pool were colliers meeting an increase in the demand for coal as the population of London rose. Coastal trade virtually doubled between 1750 and 1796 reaching 11,964 vessels in 1795. In overseas trade, in 1751 the pool handled 1,682 ships and 234,639 tons of goods. By 1794, this had risen to 3,663 ships and 620,845 tons. By this time, the river was lined with nearly continuous walls of wharves running for miles along both banks, and hundreds of ships moored in the river or alongside the quays. In the late 18th century, an ambitious scheme was proposed by Willey Reveley to straighten the Thames between Wapping and Woolwich Reach by cutting a new channel across the Rotherhithe, Isle of Dogs, and Greenwich peninsulas. The three great horseshoe bends would be cut off with locks, as huge wet docks. This was not realised, though a much smaller channel, the City Canal, was subsequently cut across the Isle of Dogs.

===Enclosed dock systems===
London&#x27;s Docklands had their origin in the lack of capacity in the Pool of London which particularly affected the West India trade. In 1799, the West India Dock Act allowed a new off-river dock to be built for produce from the West Indies, and the rest of Docklands followed as landowners built enclosed docks with better security and facilities than the Pool&#x27;s wharves.

Throughout the 19th century, a series of enclosed dock systems was built, surrounded by high walls to protect cargoes from river piracy. These included West India Docks (1802), East India Docks (1803, originating from the Brunswick Dock of 1790), London Docks (1805), Surrey Commercial Docks (1807, originating from the Howland Great Wet Dock of 1696), St Katharine Docks (1828), Royal Victoria Dock (1855), Millwall Dock (1868), Royal Albert Dock (1880), and Tilbury docks (1886).

The enclosed docks were built by several rival private companies, notably the East &amp; West India Docks Company (owners of the East India, West India, and Tilbury docks), Surrey Commercial Docks Company and London &amp; St Katharine Docks Company (owners of the London, St Katharine and Royal docks). By the beginning of the 20th century, competition and strikes led to pressure for amalgamation. A Royal Commission led to the setting up of the Port of London Authority (PLA) in 1908. In 1909, the PLA took control of the enclosed docks from Tower Bridge to Tilbury, with a few minor exceptions such as Poplar Dock which remained as a railway company facility. It also took over control of the river between Teddington Lock and Yantlet Creek from the City corporation which had been responsible since the 13th century. The PLA head Office at Trinity Square Gardens was built by John Mowlem &amp; Co and completed in 1919.

The PLA dredged a deep water channel, added the King George V Dock (1920) to the Royal group, and made continuous improvements to the other enclosed dock systems throughout the first two-thirds of the 20th century. This culminated in expansion of Tilbury in the late 1960s to become a major container port (the UK&#x27;s largest in the early 1970s), together with a huge riverside grain terminal and mechanised facilities for timber handling. Under the PLA, London&#x27;s annual trade had grown to 60 million tons (38% of UK trade) by 1939, but was mainly transferred to the Clyde and Liverpool during World War 2. After the war, London recovered, again reaching 60 million tons in the 1960s.



===Dockhands===

By 1900, the wharves and docks were receiving about 7.5 million tons of cargo each; an inevitable result of the extending reach of the British Empire. Of course, because of its size and grandeur, the Port was a place of work for many labourers in late 19th and early 20th century London. While most of the dockers were casual labourers, there were skilled stevedores who loaded ships, and lightermen who unloaded cargo from moored boats via barges. While these specific dockhands found regular work, the average dockhand lived day to day, hoping he would be hired whenever a ship came in. Many times these workers would actually bribe simply for a day&#x27;s work; and a day&#x27;s work could be 24 hours of continuous labouring. In addition, the work itself was incredibly dangerous. A docker would suffer a fatal injury from falling cargo almost every week during 1900, and non-fatal injuries were even more frequent.

The London dockers handled exotic imports such as precious stones, African ivory, Indian spices, and Jamaican rum that they could never dream of purchasing themselves, and so robberies were very common on the London docks. Dockers would leave work with goods hidden under their clothes, and robbers would break into warehouses at night. While tobacco, pineapples, bearskins, and other goods were all targets of thievery, the most common transgression was stealing to drink. Many reports from the early 20th century detail dockers stealing bottles of brandy or gin and drinking rather than working. More often than not, the consequences were harsh. Five weeks of hard labour for one bottle of Hennessy brandy was not unheard of.

These conditions eventually spurred Ben Tillett to lead the London Dock strike of 1889. The workers asked for only a minuscule increase in payment, but foremen initially refused. Over time the strike grew and eventually helped to draw attention to the poor conditions of London dockhands. The strike also revitalized the British Trades Union movement, leading to the betterment of labourers across London.

===Port industries===
Alongside the docks many port industries developed, some of which (notably sugar refining, edible oil processing, vehicle manufacture and lead smelting) survive today. Other industries have included iron working, casting of brass and bronze, shipbuilding, timber, grain, cement and paper milling, armament manufacture, etc. London dominated the world submarine communication cable industry for decades with works at Greenwich, Silvertown, North Woolwich, Woolwich and Erith.

For centuries London was the major centre of shipbuilding in Britain (for example at Blackwall Yard, London Yard, Samuda Yard, Millwall Iron Works, Thames Ironworks, Greenwich, and Deptford and Woolwich dockyards), but declined relative to the Clyde and other centres from the mid-19th century. This also affected an attempt by Henry Bessemer to establish steel-making on the Greenwich Peninsula in the 1860s. The last major warship, HMS &quot;Thunderer&quot;, was launched in 1911.
The volume of shipping in the Port of London supported a very extensive ship repairing industry. In 1864, when most ships coming in were built of wood and powered by sail, there were 33 ship-repairing dry docks. The largest of these was Langley&#x27;s Lower Dock at Deptford Green, which was in length. While the building of large ships ceased with the closure of the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company at Leamouth in 1912, the ship repairing trade continued to flourish. Although by 1930 the number of major dry docks had been reduced to 16, highly mechanised and geared to the repair of iron and steel-hulled ships.

There were also numerous power stations and gas works on the Thames and its tributaries and canals. Major Thames-side gasworks were located at Beckton and East Greenwich, with power stations including Brimsdown, Hackney and West Ham on the River Lea and Kingston, Fulham, Lots Road, Wandsworth, Battersea, Bankside, Stepney, Deptford, Greenwich, Blackwall Point, Brunswick Wharf, Woolwich, Barking, Belvedere, Littlebrook, West Thurrock, Northfleet, Tilbury and Grain on the Thames.

The coal requirements of power stations and gas works constituted a large proportion of London&#x27;s post-war trade. A 1959 &quot;Times&quot; article states:
This coal was handled directly by riverside coal handling facilities, rather than the docks. For example, Beckton Gas Works had two large piers which dealt with both its own requirements and with the transfer of coal to lighters for delivery to other gasworks.

A considerable proportion of the drop in London&#x27;s trade since the 1960s is accounted for by loss of the coal trade, the gas works having closed following discovery of North Sea gas, domestic use of coal for heating being largely replaced by gas and electricity, and closure of all the coal-burning power stations above Tilbury. In 2011, when Tilbury Power Station switched fully to burning biomass, London&#x27;s coal imports fell to zero.

===The move downstream===

With the use of larger ships and containerisation, the importance of the upstream port declined rapidly from the mid-1960s. The enclosed docks further up river declined and closed progressively between the end of the 1960s and the early 1980s. Trade at privately owned wharves on the open river continued for longer, for example with container handling at the Victoria Deep Water Terminal on the Greenwich Peninsula into the 1990s, and bulk paper import at Convoy&#x27;s Wharf in Deptford until 2000. The wider port continued to be a major centre for trade and industry, with oil and gas terminals at Coryton, Shell Haven and Canvey in Essex and the Isle of Grain in Kent. In 1992 Government privatisation policy led to Tilbury becoming a free port. The PLA ceased to be a port operator, retaining the role of managing the Thames.

Much of the disused land of the upstream London Docklands is in the process of being developed for housing and as a second financial district for London (centred on Canary Wharf).

==The Port today==
The Port of London today comprises over 70 independently owned terminals and port facilities, directly employing over 30,000 people. These are mainly concentrated at Purfleet (with the world&#x27;s largest margarine works), Thurrock, Tilbury (the Port&#x27;s current main container facility), London Gateway, Coryton and Canvey Island in Essex, Dartford and Northfleet in Kent, and Greenwich, Silvertown, Barking, Dagenham and Erith in Greater London.

The Port of London handles containers, timber, paper, vehicles, aggregates, crude oil, petroleum products, liquefied petroleum gas, coal, metals, grain and other dry and liquid bulk materials.

In 2012 London was the second largest port in the United Kingdom by tonnage handled (43.7 million), after Grimsby and Immingham (60 million). The Port of London however handles the most non-fuel cargo of any port in the UK (at 32.2 million tonnes in 2007). Other major rival ports to London in the country are Felixstowe and Southampton, which handle the most and second-most number of containers of British ports; in 2012 London handled the third most and the Medway ports (chiefly London Thamesport) the fifth.

The number of twenty-foot equivalent units of containers handled by the Port of London exceeded two million in 2007 for the first time in the Port&#x27;s history and this continued in 2008. The Port&#x27;s capacity in handling modern, large ships and containers is set to dramatically expand with the completion of the London Gateway port project, which will be able to handle up to 3.5 million TEUs per year when fully completed.

With around 12,500 commercial shipping movements annually, the Port of London handles around 10% of the UK commercial shipping trade, and contributes £8.5 billion to the UK&#x27;s economy. In addition to cargo, 37 cruise ships visited the Port in 2008.
Once a major refiner of crude oil, today the port only imports refined products. The Kent (BP) and Shell Haven (Shell) refineries closed in 1982 and 1999, and Coryton in 2012. A number of upstream wharves remain in use. At Silvertown, for example, Tate &amp; Lyle continues to operate the world&#x27;s largest cane sugar refinery, originally served by the West India Docks but now with its own cargo handling facilities. Many wharves as far upstream as Fulham are used for the handling of aggregates brought by barge from facilities down river. Riverside sites in London are under intense pressure for prestige housing or office development, and as a consequence the Greater London Authority in consultation with the PLA has implemented a plan to safeguard 50 wharves, half above and half below the Thames Barrier.

===Intraport traffic===
In recent years there has been a resurgence in the use of the River Thames for moving cargo between terminals within the Port of London. This is seen to be in the main part due to the environmental benefits of moving such cargo by river, and as an alternative to transporting the cargo on the congested road and rail networks of the capital. Local authorities are contributing to this increase in intraport traffic, with waste transfer and demolition rubble being taken by barges on the river. The construction of the Olympic Park and Crossrail both used the river as a means of transporting cargo and waste/excavation material, and the ongoing Thames Tideway Scheme also uses the river for these purposes, as well as for transporting of its Tunnel Boring Machines as well as temporary offices. The Crossrail project alone involved the transporting of 5 million tonnes of material, almost all of which is clean earth, excavated from the ground, downstream through the Port, from locations such as Canary Wharf to new nature reserves being constructed in the Thames estuary area. This also includes the re-opening of wharves or jetties for various building projects along or near the Thames, Battersea coal jetty being the most recent.

In 2008, the figure for intraport trade was 1.9 million tonnes, making the River Thames the busiest inland waterway in the UK.

===Expansion: London Gateway===

DP World&#x27;s &quot;London Gateway&quot;, opened in November 2013, is an expansion of the Port of London on the north bank of the Thames in Thurrock, Essex, 30 miles (48 km) east of central London. It is a fully integrated logistics facility, comprising a semi-automated, deep-sea container terminal on the same site as the UK&#x27;s largest land bank for development of warehousing, distribution facilities and ancillary logistics services. It is a deep-water port able to handle the biggest container ships.

==Policing the Port==
The Port of London once had its own police force – the Port of London Authority Police – but is today policed by a number of forces. These are the local territorial police forces of the areas the Thames passes through (the Metropolitan, City of London, Essex and Kent forces) and the Port of Tilbury Police (formed in 1992 and a remnant of the old PLA force). The Metropolitan police have a special Marine Support Unit, formerly known as the Thames Division, which patrol and police the Thames in the Greater London area. A sixth police force in the Port may be established with the creation of the London Gateway port.

<doc id="294848" wikidata="Q7231179" url="?curid=294848" title="Port of London Authority">
<text>The Port of London Authority (PLA) is a self-funding public trust established on 31 March 1909 in accordance with the Port of London Act 1908 to govern the Port of London. Its responsibility extends over the Tideway of the River Thames and its continuation (the Kent/Essex strait). It maintains and supervises navigation, and protects the river&#x27;s environment.

The PLA originally operated all enclosed dock systems on the river (except the Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock), but these have long been closed to commercial traffic, with the exception of Port of Tilbury, which was privatised in 1992. It inherited the private police forces of the companies which had previously run the docks, reorganising them into a single Port of London Authority Police.

== Finance ==
The PLA receives no funding from the government and is entirely self-financing. Revenues are raised from conservancy charges on vessels and cargo, pilotage charges, annual port dues, hydrographic services, river works licence fees and charges for other services.

==Limits==

The PLA&#x27;s responsibility extends from a point marked by an obelisk just downstream of Teddington Lock (the upstream limit of the tidal river) to the end of the Kent/Essex strait of the North Sea (between Margate to the south and Gunfleet Lighthouse, near Frinton-on-Sea, to the north,) a total of about 95 miles (150 km). The PLA does not cover the Medway or the Swale.

From the City of London, via the Thames Conservancy, the PLA inherited the conservancy, management and control of the river instead of ownership of the bed of the river and foreshore (the Crown was prohibited from alienating any of its lands by section 5 of the Crown Lands Act 1702; the Crown was presumed to own the bed of Thames and &#x27;as conservators&#x27; the City of London were prohibited from owning any part of that same river bed) from Teddington to the Yantlet Line (between Southend and Grain).

During much of the 20th century the PLA owned and operated many of the docks and wharfs in the port, but they have all now been either closed or privatised. Today the PLA acts mainly as a managing authority for the tidal stretch of the River Thames, ensuring safe navigation, and the well-being of the port and its activities. Comparable responsibilities for the river including, and upstream of, Teddington Lock fall to the Environment Agency.

The PLA today has a number of statutory duties, including river traffic control, security, navigational safety (including pilotage, buoys, beacons, bridge lights and channel surveys), conservation (including dredging and maintaining certain river banks), encouraging both commercial and leisure uses of the river, and protecting its environment. The PLA is responsible for the operation of Richmond Lock, but not for the Thames Barrier which is managed by the Environment Agency in its flood management role.

== Harbour masters ==
The PLA&#x27;s navigational safety team is headed by a Chief Harbour Master who has overall responsibility for defining and enforcing the regulations needed to support and manage the safety of navigation within the PLA&#x27;s limits. Given the extensive length of river covered by the PLA, day-to-day management of the river is overseen by a team of harbour masters who cover the entirety of the river between Teddington Lock and the outer estuary.

==Centres==

The PLA originally had its headquarters on Tower Hill in the City of London, but today it is based at London River House and Royal Terrace Pier in Gravesend. The PLA retains a presence in the City in offices at Pinnacle House on St. Dunstan&#x27;s Hill, where the Chair and Chief Executive are based.

Control of ship traffic on the Thames within the Port is orchestrated from two Port Control centres:
*The Thames Barrier Navigation Centre in Woolwich, for reaches upstream of Erith, London, and
*Port Control Gravesend (the main facility) for reaches downstream of Erith.

Both Port Control centres operate the same system for coordinating traffic within the PLA&#x27;s area, Vessel Traffic Services (VTS). The system involves 16 radar stations along the river and out in the estuary.

The PLA owns Denton Wharf and Jetty in Gravesend, which is the main base for its fleet of more than 40 vessels. It also provides lift-out and maintenance services for other users of the Thames. The PLA owns Barrier Gardens Pier and Unity House, near the Thames Barrier, providing a convenient base for its Driftwood vessels. There are also two pilot stations at Harwich and Ramsgate, beyond the estuary and the Port of London. From these stations pilots are sent out and return from large vessels entering and leaving the Port.

The PLA employs about 360 people.

== Pier and jetty ownership ==

The PLA owns six piers and jetties on the River Thames. These are available for other river users as well as the PLA&#x27;s own vessels.

* Barrier Gardens Pier and Unity House, Woolwich
* Royal Terrace Pier and landing stage, Gravesend
* Denton Wharf and Jetty, Gravesend
* Masthouse Terrace Pier, Isle of Dogs
* Peruvian Wharf, Newham
* Royal Primrose Wharf, Newham

==Vessels==

The PLA has four channel surveying vessels, eight launches for harbour and river patrols, and twenty other craft. Five new patrol vessels were built by Alnmaritec in Northumberland and delivered in 2009.

===Harbour Service vessels===
*&quot;Chelsea&quot; and &quot;Richmond&quot;. Catamarans designed for shallow water working in the upper reaches of the port area.
*&quot;Lambeth&quot;, &quot;Kew&quot;, &quot;Southwark&quot; and &quot;Barnes&quot;. Catamarans designed for the lower tidal waters and for use as Pilot cutters.
*&quot;Easthaven&quot; and &quot;Crane&quot; two shallow draught RIBs, the former based at Holehaven and the latter at Richmond.

===Marine Service vessels===
*&quot;London Titan&quot;. Mooring maintenance vessel
*&quot;Driftwood II&quot; and &quot;Driftwood III&quot;. Primarily designed for the clearance of driftwood and other debris from the river. Also equipped for salvage operations. Normally accompanied by a fast tender.
*&quot;PLA Diver&quot;. Diving support vessel.
*&quot;Impulse&quot;. Pusher tug for handling barges. Also equipped for salvage and clearance work.
*&quot;Recover&quot; and &quot;Respond&quot;. Oil clearance vessels.
*&quot;Gunfleet&quot;. Open deck RIB.
*&quot;Benfleet&quot; Wheelhouse fitted RIB used for crew transfer purposes.

===Hydrographic Surveying vessels===
*&quot;Maplin&quot;, &quot;Thame&quot;, &quot;Yantlet&quot; and &quot;Galloper&quot;. Various catamarans equipped with advanced hydrographic survey equipment. There is also a RIB for use in very shallow waters.

===Pilot cutters===
*&quot;Patrol&quot;. Ex. Estuary Services vessel built by Halmatic, based on the Arun class lifeboat design. Based at Gravesend.
*&quot;Guide&quot;. Ex. Estuary Services vessel, 48/50&#x27;, built by Halmatic. Based at Gravesend.
*&quot;Leader&quot;. A hybrid diesel and battery electric boat by Goodchild Marine, delivered in 2019. Based at Gravesend.
*There are six cutters based at Ramsgate and Sheerness operated by Estuary Services Ltd, a company owned by the PLA.

==Railways==

The PLA inherited an extensive railway system from the previous dock companies. This included engine sheds, located at Millwall, Tilbury and Custom House, its own signal boxes and level crossings. The main duties undertaken by the authority&#x27;s locomotives were shunting the various sidings, wharves and factories around the PLA estate.

The PLA operated a fleet of 0-6-0T and 0-6-0ST steam locomotives made by various manufacturers including Hudswell Clark, Robert Stephenson, Andrew Barclay, Hunslet and Manning Wardle. The steam locomotives were largely withdrawn in 1959 although a few lingered on until 1963. The diesels that replaced them were built by the Yorkshire Engine Company but, with declining traffic, the railway system closed on 1 May 1970.

==Traditions==
The Lord Mayor of London, the chief dignitary of the City of London, is &quot;ex officio&quot; the Admiral of the Port of London.

The PLA uses a blue ensign with a gold heraldic sealion on all its vessels. It also has a house flag and pennants for the use of the chairman and the vice chairman of its board.

The coat of arms of the PLA was granted in August 1909. The blazon or heraldic description is as follows:
Azure, issuing from a castle argent, a demi-man vested, holding in the dexter hand a drawn sword, and in the sinister a scroll Or, the one representing the Tower of London, the other the figure of St Paul, the patron saint of London.&lt;br&gt;Crest: On a wreath of the colours, an ancient ship Or, the main sail charged with the arms of the City of London.&lt;br&gt; Supporters: On either side a sea-lion argent, crined, finned and tufted or, issuing from waves of the sea proper, that to the sinister grasping the banner of King Edward II; that to the dexter the banner of King Edward VII

The Latin motto is &quot;Floreat Imperii Portvs&quot;, meaning &quot;May the Port of the Empire Flourish&quot;.

<text>People&#x27;s World, official successor to the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, is a Marxist-Leninist and American leftist national daily online news publication. Founded by activists, socialists, communists, and those active in the labor movement in the early 1900s, the current publication is a result of a merger between the &quot;Daily World&quot; and the West Coast weekly paper &quot;People&#x27;s Daily World&quot; in 1987.

==History==
&quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; traces its lineage to the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; newspaper, founded by communists, socialists, union members, and other activists in Chicago in 1924. On the front page of its first edition, the paper declared that &quot;big business interests, bankers, merchant princes, landlords, and other profiteers&quot; should fear the Daily Worker. It pledged to &quot;raise the standards of struggle against the few who rob and plunder the many&quot;.

The current publication is a result of a merger between the &quot;Daily World&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;) and the West Coast weekly paper &quot;People&#x27;s Daily World&quot;.

The &quot;Daily Worker&quot; was a national newspaper first published in 1924. It became known as the &quot;Daily World&quot; in 1968.

The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily World&quot; was first launched in 1938. Its founder, Harrison George, started &quot;People&#x27;s Daily World&quot; in San Francisco after he raised $33,000 from supporters in California. The paper had 20,000 readers and cost 3 cents. The paper circulated throughout the West Coast. It was completely funded through subscribers.

After World War II, many of the editors of &quot;People&#x27;s Daily World&quot; were convicted using the Smith Act of &quot;conspiring to violently overthrow the U.S. government&quot;. During the 1950s, reporters from the paper were not allowed in the press galleries of various California governing bodies. Circulation was also down in the 1950s, with the paper only having a press run of 5,000 in 1955. In 1957, the paper became a weekly publication.

In 1986, the &quot;Daily World&quot; merged with &quot;People&#x27;s Daily World.&quot;

Its publisher is Long View Publishing Company. The online newspaper is a member of the International Labor Communications Association and is indexed in the Alternative Press Index. Its staff belong to the NewsGuild-CWA labor union, and by extension AFL–CIO.

&quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; also has a Spanish language section called Mundo Popular.

In 2009, &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; was re-launched as an online news publication where it continues to publish news on a daily basis.

== About ==

&quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; is funded by its supporters and published by a small staff, and a network of volunteers. The newspaper is a member of the International Labor Communications Association.

On January 1, 2010, the &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; became an online-only publication using Creative Commons license.

== Notable reporters and writers ==
The journal has had several notable reporters and columnists.

*Woodie Guthrie, early columnist, writing 253 articles, most during 1939.
*Ollie Harrington, cartoonist
* Alice Greenfield McGrath, reporter.
* Ella Reeve Bloor, early columnist and reporter

<doc id="294851" wikidata="Q75079" url="?curid=294851" title="Chris Columbus (filmmaker)">
<text>Christopher Joseph Columbus (born September 10, 1958) is an American filmmaker. Born in Spangler, Pennsylvania, Columbus studied film at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts where he developed an interest in filmmaking. After writing screenplays for several teen comedies in the mid-1980s, including &quot;Gremlins&quot;, &quot;The Goonies&quot;, and &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot;, he made his directorial debut with a teen adventure, &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; (1987). Columbus gained recognition soon after with the highly successful Christmas comedy &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990) and &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992).

The comedy &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993), starring Robin Williams, was another box office success for Columbus. He went on to direct several other films throughout the 1990s, which were mostly met with lukewarm reception. However, he found commercial success again for directing the film adaptations of J. K. Rowling&#x27;s novels, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) and its sequel, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002). In addition to directing, Columbus was a producer for &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004), and the drama &quot;The Help&quot; (2011), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. He also directed the fantasy &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot; (2010) and the 3D action comedy &quot;Pixels&quot; (2015).

Columbus is the co-founder of 1492 Pictures, a film production company that has produced some of his films since 1995. More recently, he co-founded another production firm with his daughter in 2014, called Maiden Voyage Pictures. In 2017, he launched ZAG Animation Studios, alongside Michael Barnathan, Haim Saban, and Jeremy Zag. Columbus is also known for his collaboration with composer John Williams, with whom he had worked on the film &quot;Home Alone&quot; and the film series &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.

==Early life==
Columbus was born in Spangler, Pennsylvania, and raised in Youngstown, Ohio, the only child born to Mary Irene ( Puskar), a factory worker, and Alex Michael Columbus, an aluminum plant worker and coal miner. He is of Italian and Czech descent. As a child, he enjoyed drawing storyboards, Marvel Comics and began making 8mm films in high school.

After graduating from John F. Kennedy High School in Warren, Ohio, he went on to study at New York University&#x27;s film school at the Tisch School of the Arts, where he was a schoolmate of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and Alec Baldwin. Although he received a scholarship, he forgot to renew it and was forced to take a factory job to pay for schooling. While on shifts, he secretly worked on a 20-page screenplay, which one of his teachers would later use to help him get an agent. Columbus now states that the experience &quot;saved my life&quot; and he was able to acknowledge &quot;the terrifying reality I faced of having to live and work in that factory for the rest of my life in that town if I didn&#x27;t make it&quot;.

In 1980, while at NYU, Columbus directed a short film entitled &quot;I Think I&#x27;m Gonna Like It Here&quot; that was later noticed by Steven Spielberg. &quot;I Think I&#x27;m Gonna Like It Here&quot; was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2014.

==Career==
=== 1984–1990: Early success ===
Columbus&#x27; professional career began in the early 1980s, as a writer for the screenplay of &quot;Reckless&quot; (1984). Columbus later said, &quot;it wasn&#x27;t my best work. I intended it to be semi-biographical ... and the film was based on my attempts to break free. But the director turned it into a clumsy teen sex drama and the experience was so degrading.&quot; Dissatisfied, Columbus conceived a new screenplay whilst living in an apartment loft, a comedy-horror titled &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984). In late 1981, he eventually received a phone call from Steven Spielberg, who expressed an interest in buying the script. Upon release, the film was a critical success. Columbus then moved to Los Angeles to work for Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment, writing more scripts including &quot;The Goonies&quot; and &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; (both 1985).

After staying in Los Angeles for two years, he said, &quot;There&#x27;s an unreality to the place, a lack of connection with real people.&quot; He decided to move back to New York City. He wrote episodes for the animated series &quot;Galaxy High&quot; (1986) and received screenwriting credit for &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot; (1989). Columbus then started his directing career with the teen comedy &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; (1987). The film received mixed reviews from critics and was regarded as a &quot;mediocre debut&quot;. Next, he wrote and directed &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; (1988) which is a story about Elvis Presley being kidnapped and finding himself offering counsel and help to a small-town family. The film was a commercial failure at the box office and it also received mixed-to-negative reviews.

In the late 1980s, fellow filmmaker John Hughes approached Columbus to direct &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990), a comedy film written by Hughes, where eight-year-old Kevin McCallister must defend his home from two burglars. Columbus had left &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; before shooting started, because of a personality clash with actor Chevy Chase, who Columbus said treated him &quot;like dirt&quot;. Columbus particularly enjoyed the Christmas theme of the &quot;Home Alone&quot; script and quickly accepted the offer. Subsequently, Columbus hired Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, and Catherine O&#x27;Hara as the principal cast. Filming took four months between February and May 1990 and the film was released to theaters on November 16, 1990, to commercial success. &quot;Home Alone&quot; grossed $285 million in North America and $190 million elsewhere for a worldwide $476.7 million, against a budget of $18 million. Nominated for two Academy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards, the film served as Culkin&#x27;s breakthrough role. Dave Kehr of &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised Hughes for writing recognizable characters, and Columbus for direction with &quot;wit and warmth&quot;. &quot;Home Alone&quot; has since been regarded as a &quot;classic&quot; to watch during the holiday season.

=== 1991–2000: Comedies and romances ===
In 1991, Columbus wrote and directed the romantic comedy-drama &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; (1991), with John Hughes serving as co-producer. Starring John Candy, Maureen O&#x27;Hara, Ally Sheedy, and Anthony Quinn, the film depicts a Chicago policeman who must balance his loyalty between his mother and a shy funeral home employee, a loose adaptation of &quot;Marty&quot;. The film managed to garner some favourable reviews despite performing tepidly at the box office. In 1992, Columbus returned to direct the sequel to the first film, titled &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.&quot; Featuring the same principal cast of its predecessor, the plot takes place one year after the events of the first film. The film follows Kevin McCallister as he accidentally boards the wrong flight to New York City and finds himself confronted by the two same burglars in the first film. &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; was released on November 20, 1992, to mixed reviews, but strong box office results, grossing $359 million worldwide. Janet Maslin for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Home Alone 2&quot; may be lazily conceived, but it is staged with a sense of occasion and a lot of holiday cheer. The return of Mr. Culkin in this role is irresistible, even if this utterly natural comic actor has been given little new to do. Mr. Pesci and Mr. Stern bring great gusto to their characters&#x27; stupidity&quot;.

Columbus&#x27; next directorial feature was &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993), an adaptation of Anne Fine&#x27;s novel &quot;Alias Madame Doubtfire&quot; about an unemployed father who disguises himself as a nanny so he can spend time with his children. Starring Robin Williams, Sally Field and Pierce Brosnan, Williams was given creative freedom to improvise his lines, provoking amusement to all of the cast and crew. The film was released by 20th Century Fox in November 1993 to mixed and positive reception. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 72%, praising Williams. Roger Ebert calls Williams &quot;a mercurial talent who loves to dart in and out of many different characters and voices&quot;, but thought &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; &quot;has the values and depth of a sitcom&quot;. However, the film performed well at the box office, earning $441.3 million worldwide. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Makeup, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and Golden Globe Award for Best Picture.

In 1995, Columbus co-founded his own production company, 1492 Pictures, named after the year that Christopher Columbus reached the Americas; a pun on his own name. He then wrote and directed another film, a remake of the French film &quot;Neuf mois&quot; titled &quot;Nine Months&quot; (1995), which was produced by 1492 Pictures. A romantic comedy, &quot;Nine Months&quot; starred Hugh Grant, Julianne Moore, Tom Arnold, Joan Cusack, Jeff Goldblum, and Robin Williams. The story centers on a man who finds out that his longtime girlfriend is pregnant and has to change his lifestyle. Although the film was criticized for being &quot;mismanaged&quot;, it was a commercial success, grossing $138.5 million at the box office. Columbus followed up on this effort with &quot;Stepmom&quot; (1998), a comedy-drama starring Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, and Ed Harris. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; Kenneth Turan praises Roberts and Harris&#x27; performances despite the script having a &quot;tiny handful of honest moments&quot;. With an estimated budget of $50 million, the film grossed a healthy $159.7 million worldwide. Sarandon also earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama.

Columbus reunited with Robin Williams for his next project, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot;. Based on the novel &quot;The Positronic Man&quot;, by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg, the film tells the story of a robot who becomes human-like and acquires emotions. The supporting cast included Sam Neill, Embeth Davidtz, Wendy Crewson, and Oliver Platt. The film was released on December 17, 1999, and was a commercial failure, grossing $87.4 million from a budget of $100 million. Critical response to the film were mixed, with Ben Falk of the BBC describing it as &quot;the worst kind of movie – one with no direction, no identity, and above all no heart&quot;. Peter Stack of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; opined of the film, &quot;It&#x27;s a bit strange, and strained. More syrupy melodrama than comedy [...] doesn&#x27;t have much of the usual Williams manic antics&quot;, but compliments the computer-generated imagery. &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup at the 72nd Academy Awards.

=== 2001–2010: &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and other film series ===

After reading J. K. Rowling&#x27;s 1997 fantasy novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, Columbus expressed a strong desire to direct the film adaptation. In 2000, he convinced Warner Bros. to select him as director for it. The film is the first installment of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series and was written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman. The story follows Harry Potter&#x27;s first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and his self-discovery as a famous wizard. Columbus relocated to the United Kingdom with his family to focus on directing. Columbus said the casting process was &quot;very intense&quot;, but Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson were eventually picked for the lead roles. Filming began on September 29, 2000, and lasted for 180 days. The film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on November 4, 2001, to critical and commercial success, grossing $975.1 million worldwide. The film was praised for its sets, costumes, casting, musical score, cinematography and special effects. In addition, it was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Original Score, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.

In 2002, Columbus returned to direct the second installment, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002), based on Rowling&#x27;s second novel. Featuring much of the same cast from the first film, the story follows Harry Potter&#x27;s second year at the school when a chamber is opened unleashing a monster. Producer David Heyman said, &quot;Fortunately, we benefited from the experience of the first film ... [the cast] have maintained their enthusiasm, sense of wonder&quot;. Columbus also opted to use more handheld cameras for freedom of movement. The film was released to theaters on November 15, 2002. &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; shared similar critical acclaim to the first film, and grossed $879 million worldwide. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that the film was long but praised it for the special effects and &quot;thrilling&quot; sequences. At the 2003 BAFTA Awards, the film garnered nominations for Best Production Design, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects.

In 2004, Columbus wrote and produced &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot;, a Christmas comedy based on the 2001 novel &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; by John Grisham; the film was a box office success but received mostly negative reviews. In the same year, Columbus returned for the third installment of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. Physically exhausted from the first two films, he decided not to direct but serve as producer alongside Heyman and director Alfonso Cuarón. The film premiered on May 31, 2004, in the United Kingdom to strong critical praise and earned $796.9 million worldwide. After returning to the United States in 2005, Columbus intended to produce a superhero film, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, but due to disagreements with director Tim Story, he was fired. Next, he directed 2005&#x27;s &quot;Rent&quot;, a musical drama adapted from the 1996 Broadway musical of the same name. The film, starring six of the original Broadway cast members, depicts the lives of several Bohemians and their struggles living in East Village of New York City from 1989 to 1990. The film had mixed reviews and a poor box office performance.

In 2006, Columbus served as a producer for &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;, a fantasy film based on the 1993 children&#x27;s book of the same name by illustrator Milan Trenc, and is the first installment in the &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; series. The film stars Ben Stiller as Larry Daley, a father who applies for a job at the American Museum of Natural History and subsequently discovers that the exhibits come to life at night. Next, he served as an executive producer for &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot; (2007), a sequel to the first film which was also a commercial success. In 2009, he produced &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot;, the second installment of the series. Despite mixed reviews, the film was a box office success, earning $413.1 million worldwide. That same year, he directed &quot;I Love You, Beth Cooper&quot;, a comedy starring Hayden Panettiere and Paul Rust, based on a novel by Larry Doyle. The film was released in July 2009 to negative reviews; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Columbus &quot;flattens every joke and sucks the life out of the actors&quot;, adding it is &quot;super bad&quot;.

Despite this setback, Columbus was hired by 20th Century Fox to direct &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot; (2010), which he also produced. The film is the first installment in the &quot;Percy Jackson&quot; series and is based on fantasy Greek mythology: the 2005 novel &quot;The Lightning Thief&quot; by Rick Riordan. Starring an ensemble led by Logan Lerman, the film received mixed reviews (and was panned by fans of the original series) but found box office success upon its release in February. The film grossed $226.4 million worldwide. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;unadventurous and uninteresting&quot; and criticized screenwriter Craig Titley for changing the original story. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot;″s Linda Barnard praised Columbus&#x27; ability to &quot;woo a young audience&quot; but thought the film lacked &quot;Harry Potter&quot; charm.

=== 2011–present: Focus as a producer and &quot;Pixels&quot; ===
As early as 2009, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine reported that Columbus, Michael Barnathan, and Mark Radcliffe were working on a film adaptation of Kathryn Stockett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Help&quot;. Released in 2011, the film of the same name was directed by Tate Taylor with Columbus serving as producer. The film and novel recount the story of a young white aspiring journalist, Eugenia &quot;Skeeter&quot; Phelan, and her relationship with two black maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, during the Civil Rights Movement. The film received critical and commercial success, earning $216.6 million worldwide. Roger Ebert described it as &quot;involving and wonderfully acted&quot;, and Amy Biancolli of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;a film that makes us root for the good guys, hiss at the bad and convulse in laughter when good wreaks vengeance with a smile&quot;. At the 84th Academy Awards, Octavia Spencer won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role. The film also received three other nominations: Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for Jessica Chastain. The film won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.In 2013, Columbus co-authored the &quot;House of Secrets&quot; book series with Ned Vizzini. Shortly, Columbus returned to the &quot;Percy Jackson&quot; series, as an executive producer for the sequel titled &quot;Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters.&quot; Directed by Thor Freudenthal, and starring much of the cast from the previous installment, the film grossed $200.9 million worldwide. However, it received a divided critical reaction. Columbus next produced &quot;Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb&quot;, the final installment in the &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; series. Released in December 2014, the film was a financial success, grossing $363.2 million at the box office. It was also Robin Williams&#x27; final film appearance before his death.

In 2014, Columbus cofounded production company Maiden Voyage Pictures with his daughter, Eleanor. He also co-founded an animation studio called ZAG Animation Studios with Saban Capital Group and ZAG Entertainment.

Columbus directed the science fiction comedy &quot;Pixels&quot; (2015). He first learned about the project from Adam Sandler; Columbus said &quot;he gave me the &quot;Pixels&quot; script after we hit it off. My daughter read it and said, &#x27;You have to read this movie. It&#x27;s completely fun and unexpected&#x27;&quot;. The film is based on Patrick Jean&#x27;s 2010 short film of the same name, which depicts aliens who attack the Earth in the form of arcade video games. Principal photography took three months in Toronto, after which computer-generated imagery and visual effects were then applied. Starring Sandler, Kevin James, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad and Brian Cox, &quot;Pixels&quot; was met with mixed reviews but earned $244.9 million at the box office. Marjorie Baumgarten of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; said the film is &quot;flat-footed and grows tedious after the first hour&quot; but praised the 3D effects which &quot;enhances the action&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the film one star out of four, calling it &quot;a 3D metaphor for Hollywood&#x27;s digital assault on our eyes and brains [...] relentless and exhausting&quot;.

Also in 2015, Columbus served as a producer for three films: supernatural horror &quot;The Witch&quot;, Italian drama &quot;Mediterranea&quot;, and a comedy titled &quot;It Had to Be You&quot;. During 2016, Columbus produced small-scale and independent features. First, &quot;The Young Messiah&quot;, a fictional story of a seven-year-old Jesus who tries to discover the truth about his life when he returns to Nazareth from Egypt. Second, &quot;Tallulah&quot;, a comedy drama starring Elliot Page, Allison Janney, and Tammy Blanchard; the film is about a young woman who takes a baby from its negligent mother and pretends the child is her own. &quot;Tallulah&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2016, and was released on Netflix on July 29, 2016. In 2017, Columbus served as an executive producer for &quot;Menashe&quot;, and a producer for &quot;Patti Cake$&quot; and &quot;I Kill Giants&quot;. Columbus also produced &quot;The Christmas Chronicles&quot; (2018), a family film directed by Clay Kaytis.

In 2018, Columbus was announced as director of a &quot;Five Nights at Freddy&#x27;s&quot; film adaptation, but he backed out of the project by September 2021. In 2019, Columbus joined the producers of &quot;The Lighthouse&quot;, a film directed by Robert Eggers and starring Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson as two lighthouse keepers who lose their sanity. In 2018 it was announced that Columbus would serve as an executive producer for &quot;Scoob!&quot;, an animated adventure film featuring characters from the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise; it was released on May 15, 2020. He has also directed &quot;The Christmas Chronicles 2&quot;, a sequel to the film he had co-produced.

==== Upcoming projects ====
Columbus has been attached as a director to a &quot;Hello Ghost&quot; remake, announced in 2011. In 2017, Columbus said he had written a script for &quot;Gremlins 3&quot;. On April 18, 2024, it was announced Columbus would direct a film adaptation of the Richard Osman novel &quot;The Thursday Murder Club&quot; for Amblin Partners.

In January 2025, it was reported by &quot;Deadline&quot; that Columbus was writing sequels to &quot;Gremlins&quot; and &quot;The Goonies&quot; for Warner Bros., although nothing official has been confirmed by the studio.

== Filmmaking style ==
Columbus&#x27;s films are often grounded in stories about unconventional and dysfunctional families, and explore characters who lose their loved ones. He is regarded as a &quot;sentimental&quot; filmmaker due to his exploration of contemporary domesticity. &quot;One of the themes I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by is a character facing the potential of losing their family and what that means,&quot; Columbus said in 2017. Columbus is also known for creating &quot;emotionally vivid scenes&quot;, and admits that he is drawn to extreme emotions.

Burhan Wazir of &quot;The Guardian&quot; states that Columbus prefers characters that are the &quot;everyday American men, women, and children who struggle to uphold family traditions against a changing, sometimes intimidating society&quot;. In 1993, Columbus said: &quot;I can understand the validity of showing people the ugliness of the world, but I also think there is a place for movies to leave people with a sense of hope. If your film isn&#x27;t going to do that, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth making.&quot; Culture website &quot;The Take&quot; opined that Columbus excels in creating heartwarming family films with untrained child actors, but found box office success without an &quot;incredibly distinct cinematic style&quot; to his work.

Columbus has served as a mentor to Robert Eggers since &quot;The Witch&quot;.

==Personal life==
Columbus married choreographer Monica Devereux in 1983. The couple have four children. His daughter Eleanor had a non-speaking role as Susan Bones in the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. The family resides in San Francisco. Columbus endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election. He is also a partner at Ocean Blue Entertainment, a creative content company focused on film production. He is of no relation to Christopher Columbus.

<text>Philip Charles Lithman (17 June 1949 – 1 July 1987), who performed under the stage name Snakefinger, was an English musician, singer and songwriter. A multi-instrumentalist, he was best known for his guitar and violin work and his collaborations with The Residents.

==History==
Lithman was born in Tooting, South London, and came from the British blues scene. He moved to San Francisco in 1971 and became associated with the avant-garde group The Residents. It is said he was given the name &#x27;Snakefinger&#x27; by The Residents themselves based on a photograph of Lithman performing, in which his finger looks like a snake about to attack his violin.

In 1972 Lithman returned to England and formed the pub rock band Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers with Martin Stone, ex-member of Mighty Baby and a fellow ex-member of Junior&#x27;s Blues Band. As a duo, they released the album &quot;Kings of Robot Rhythm&quot;. In 1974, as a full band and popular live act in Britain, they released &quot;Bongos Over Balham&quot;.

Chilli Willi lasted until 1975, their last record not selling well, and by 1976 Lithman was back in the United States, this time in Los Angeles, California, seeking a recording contract, shopping his rock-style demos.

After a few years, Lithman moved back to San Francisco, reconnected with The Residents, and performed and recorded with them. Lithman&#x27;s solo records, recorded under the name Snakefinger, were released by their record label Ralph Records.

His first album on Ralph was &quot;Chewing Hides the Sound&quot; in 1979, featuring original material co-written with The Residents as well as esoteric covers like Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;The Model&quot;. The songs showcased Lithman&#x27;s distinctive slide guitar playing and often surreal imagery. This album was followed by &quot;Greener Postures&quot; in 1980, which included his first solo compositions as Snakefinger.

While on tour in Australia in 1980, Lithman had a heart attack that left him hospitalised for six months.

In 1982, Lithman formed his backing band The Vestal Virgins with former Captain Beefheart sideman Eric Drew Feldman. Snakefinger and The Vestal Virgins released &quot;Manual of Errors&quot; on Ralph in 1982. This was followed by the blues cover album &quot;Snakefinger&#x27;s History of the Blues: Live in Europe&quot; in 1984. Lithman released his fourth and final album, &quot;Night of Desirable Objects&quot; in 1986, which consisted of largely original material.

Lithman performed with The Residents on their 13th Anniversary Tour in 1986.

==Death==
On 1 July 1987, Snakefinger and his band, The Vestal Virgins, arrived in Linz, Austria, on the &quot;European Night&quot; tour. The next morning, he was found dead in a guestroom of the Posthof Club, where the band had been due to perform. He had suffered a heart attack. His single &quot;There&#x27;s No Justice in Life&quot; was released the same day. His funeral was held in England. The Residents were unable to attend it and instead performed a wake in his honour; a studio version of this performance can be heard on The Snakey Wake.

<text>Cornelius Boza-Edwards (born Cornelius Bbosa; 27 May 1956) is a former professional boxer who is the former WBC Super Featherweight champion of the world. Born in Kampala, Uganda, he fought in both the super-featherweight and lightweight divisions. He emigrated from Uganda to England, where he lived for a long period. He now lives in the United States, where he trains other boxers.

==Amateur career==
Boza-Edwards started boxing at the age of nine in Uganda alongside other notable fighters such as Ayub Kalule and John Mugabi. He moved to England with his mentor Jack Edwards and continued to box firstly with the New Enterprise club in Tottenham and then the Fitzroy Lodge club in South London. He boxed for England but was overlooked for selection for the Olympic team after being beaten on points by Pat Cowdell in the 1976 ABA championships.

Boza-Edwards was given another opportunity when he was scheduled to compete as a featherweight boxer for Uganda in the 1976 Montreal Olympics. However, Uganda boycotted the Montreal Olympics, as did many other African countries. The boycott deprived him of the chance of competing in the Olympics.

==Professional career==
In 1976, Boza-Edwards turned professional with Mickey Duff as his manager and George Francis as his trainer. He changed his surname to Boza on the recommendation of Mickey Duff. As it was an easier name for the fans to remember and added Edwards out of respect for Jack Edwards his mentor.

Boza-Edwards won his first nine fights before suffering a loss to Des Gwilliam when he suffered a cut eye. He then went on an 18-fight winning streak and was offered a fight as a substitute against Alexis Arguello. He put up a spirited performance before being retired by his corner at the end of the eighth round. Arguello praised Boza-Edwards and said that he thought that he would become the champion after he had moved up in weight to the lightweight division. Boza-Edwards was actually boxing in the lightweight division at the time but moved down to the super-featherweight division.

==WBC Super-Featherweight Champion==
In 1981, Boza-Edwards won the WBC World Super-Featherweight Title from Rafael &quot;Bazooka&quot; Limón with a fifteen-round decision at Stockton, California. Limón, a Mexican, had made his infamous &quot;You know what happens to British boxers when they face Mexicans&quot; comment. In reference to the fight between Lupe Pintor and Johnny Owen, after which Owen had died.

He defeated Bobby Chacon after he retired at the end of the thirteenth round in his first and only successful defence. He lost the title three months later in an upset to Rolando Navarrete, by knockout in round five. Navarrete had come in as a late substitute for Limón and shocked Boza-Edwards by knocking him down three times, the final time he was counted out.

==Later career==
In 1982, Boza-Edwards won the European Super-featherweight title by defeating Carlos Hernandez of Spain after he retired in the fourth round. He then based himself in the United States and became a favourite on the television networks with his aggressive style of fighting.

He was meant to fight Bobby Chacon for the WBC World Super-Featherweight Title in 1983 but boxing politics meant that the WBC withdrew recognition of the fight, which went ahead anyway. Chacon won on points in a fight where both fighters were knocked down but needed 40 stitches afterwards. The fight was voted &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine Fight of the Year 1983. Following his loss to Chacon he fought Rocky Lockridge the former WBA super-featherweight champion and lost on points over ten rounds.

Boza-Edwards moved up to the lightweight division and earned a title shot against Héctor Camacho in 1986 for the WBC World Lightweight Title which he lost by decision over twelve rounds. His final shot at the title was in 1987 against José Luis Ramírez in Paris and he was knocked out in the fifth round of a fight for the WBC World Lightweight Title. Following this defeat he retired from boxing and became a trainer.

==Personal life==
Boza-Edwards first wife Jackie died from kidney failure six months after giving birth to their daughter Michelle in the UK. He was nearly lost to the sport of boxing as a result of his grief but decided to continue. He remarried after relocating to the US and he and his wife Rumiko have two daughters, Dominique and Jenna.

==Mayweather Boxing Club==
Boza-Edwards now runs the Mayweather Boxing Club in Las Vegas, NV. He was inducted into the Nevada Boxing Hall of fame in 2014

<text>Callao () is a Peruvian seaside city and region on the Pacific Ocean in the Lima metropolitan area. Callao is Peru&#x27;s chief seaport and home to its main airport, Jorge Chávez International Airport. Callao municipality consists of the whole Callao region, which is also coterminous with the province of Callao. Founded in 1537 by the Spaniards, the city has a long naval history as one of the main ports in Latin America and the Pacific, as it was one of vital Spanish towns during the colonial era. Central Callao is about west of the Historic Centre of Lima.

==History==

El Callao was founded by Spanish colonists in 1537, just two years after Lima (1535). The origin of its name is unknown; both Amerindian (particularly Yunga, or Coastal Peruvian) and Spanish sources are credited, but it is certain that it was known by that name since 1550. Other sources point to the similarity with the Portuguese word &quot;calhau&quot; [pebble], having a similar sound.

It soon became the main port for Spanish commerce in the Pacific. At the height of the Viceroyalty, virtually all goods produced in Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina were carried over the Andes by mule to Callao, to be shipped to Panama, carried overland, and then transported on to Spain via Cuba. The port of Callao was also a node in the Manila galleon route connecting Latin-America and Asia through Acapulco, Mexico and Manila, Philippines. As a result, Callao also became a permanent target for pirate and corsair attacks, such as the one carried out by Francis Drake in 1579 and the blockade established by Jacques l&#x27;Hermite in 1624.

After the Battle of Ayacucho, 9 December 1824, that sealed the independence of Peru and South America, Spain made futile attempts to retain its former colonies, such as at the second siege of Callao. On 20 August 1836, during the Peru–Bolivian Confederation, President Andrés de Santa Cruz mandated the creation of the Callao Littoral Province (&quot;Provincia Litoral del Callao&quot;), which had political autonomy in its internal affairs. During the government of President Ramón Castilla, Callao was designated constitutional province (&quot;Provincia Constitucional&quot;), on 22 April 1857; before that, Callao was called Littoral province. All of the other Peruvian provinces had been given their names by law, while Callao was given it by constitutional mandate.

Callao was never part of the Lima Department nor of any other departments.

The province&#x27;s first mayor was Col. Manuel Cipriano Dulanto.

In 1921, the Bureau of Public Works granted a concession to M.I.T. engineer John Tinker Glidden for paving, administering, and inaugurating a public cart road between Callao and Lima, further coalescing a Lima metropolitan area.

By 1949, Callao was known as one of the biggest centers of coca-based products and cocaine traffic in the world.

===Notable events===
* On 28 October 1746, a tsunami caused by the 1746 Lima–Callao earthquake destroyed the entire port of Callao.
* On 22 January 1826, besieged by nationalist forces backed by Simón Bolívar, General José Ramón Rodil surrendered Callao to General Bartolomé Salom.
* On 2 May 1866, during the Battle of Callao, the Spanish fleet tried to reconquer independent Peru.
* &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; left Callao, Peru, on the afternoon of 28 April 1947.
* On 19 June 1986, the Peruvian prison massacres took place.

==City highlights==
Callao is built on and around a peninsula, the district of La Punta, a wealthy residential neighborhood. A historical fortress, the &quot;Castillo de Real Felipe&quot; (site of &quot;Rodil&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;), stands on the promontory overlooking the harbor.

A large naval base is sited in Callao. Its prison held Abimael Guzmán, the leader of the Shining Path Communist Party of Peru, and holds Vladimiro Montesinos, the ex-director of internal security during the Fujimori regime.

Jorge Chávez International Airport is located in Callao.

On a bluff overlooking the harbor sits Colegio Militar Leoncio Prado, the military high school. The city also has a university, the National University of Callao.

The main Naval Hospital, Centro Medico Naval is located on Avenida Venezuela in Bellavista. It contains the U.S. Navy command Naval Medical Research Unit Six.

Residents of Callao are known as &quot;chalacos&quot; after the Quechua word Chala meaning coast.

Callao&#x27;s professional football teams are Sport Boys and Atlético Chalaco.

===Islands===
Callao has several islands: San Lorenzo (currently a military base), El Frontón (a former high security prison), the Cavinzas Islands, and the Palomino Islands, where numerous sea lions and sea birds live in a virtually untouched ecosystem. There are proposed plans to build a huge naval, terrestrial, and air port on San Lorenzo Island. This project is called the San Lorenzo Megaport Project.

==Law and government==
Local government affairs are divided into two levels. Regional matters are handled by the Regional Government of Callao (&quot;Gobierno Regional del Callao&quot;), which is located in front of the Jorge Chávez International Airport. Affairs such as city cleaning, promoting of sports and basic services are handled by the Provincial Municipality of Callao, which is headquartered in the Callao District. Also, each of the six districts has its own Municipality which handles matters in their respective jurisdictional areas.

===Administrative divisions===
Callao is divided into seven districts, (; singular: &quot;distrito&quot;), each of which is headed by a mayor (&quot;alcalde&quot;).

The rest of Callao Region is composed of the islands of San Lorenzo, El Frontón, Cavinzas and Palomino, which all together have an area of .

=== Crime ===
Callao is one of the most dangerous areas in Peru and experiences the most crime. The main port city in Peru is known as one of the largest exit points of cocaine and is rife with organized crime that results with violence. In December 2015, the government declared Callao in a state of emergency that extended until April 2016, with more than 30 people being killed at the time. In 2016, the murder rate in Callao was double the national average; from 10.2 per 100,000 in 2011 to 15.2 in 2015, compared to Lima which saw 4.8 per 100,000 in 2011 and 5.0 per 100,000 in 2015. Despite government and cultural initiatives, crime has continued to increase in Callao, with some public events in the area ending in gunfire.

== Transportation ==

=== Airport ===
Jorge Chávez International Airport (IATA: LIM, ICAO: SPJC), known as Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Chávez in Spanish, is Peru&#x27;s main international and domestic airport. It is located in Callao district, northwest from the Historic Centre of Lima. Callao is the port city now fully integrated with Lima, the nation&#x27;s capital. In 2008, the airport handled 8,288,506 passengers and 98,733 aircraft movements.

For many years it was the hub for now defunct Aeroperú and Compañía de Aviación Faucett, one of the oldest airlines in Latin America. Now it serves as a hub for many aviation companies such as Avianca Perú, Viva Air Perú, and LATAM Perú.
=== Railway ===
The port is served by the Ferrocarril Central Andino.

<text>An inflatable is an object that can be inflated with a gas, usually with air, but hydrogen, helium, and nitrogen are also used. One of several advantages of an inflatable is that it can be stored in a small space when not inflated, since inflatables depend on the presence of a gas to maintain their size and shape. Function fulfillment per mass used compared with non-inflatable strategies is a key advantage. Stadium cushions, impact guards, vehicle wheel inner tubes, emergency air bags, and inflatable space habitats employ the inflatable principle. Inflation occurs through several strategies: pumps, ram-air, blowing, and suction.

Although the term &quot;inflatable&quot; can refer to any type of inflatable object, the term is often used in boating to specifically refer to inflatable boats.

==Types==
===High-pressure vs. low-pressure===
A distinction is made between high-pressure and low-pressure inflatables. In a high-pressure inflatable, structural limbs like pillars and arches are built out of a tough, flexible material and then inflated at a relatively high pressure. These limbs hold up passive membranes. The space where the visitors or inhabitants stay is at normal atmospheric pressure. For example, airplane emergency rafts are high-pressure inflatable structures. Low-pressure inflatables, on the other hand, are slightly pressurized environments completely held up by internal pressure. In other words, the visitors or inhabitants experience a slightly higher than normal pressure. Low-pressure inflatables are usually built of lighter materials. Both types of inflatables (the low-pressure type more so) are somewhat susceptible to high winds.

===By use===

====Balloon====

A balloon is an inflatable flexible filled with air and also gas, such as helium, hydrogen, nitrous oxide or oxygen. Modern balloons can be made from materials such as latex rubber, polychloroprene, or a nylon fabric, while some early balloons were made of dried animal bladders . Latex rubber balloons may be used as inexpensive children&#x27;s toys or decorations, while others are used for practical purposes such as meteorology, medical treatment, military defense, or transportation. A balloon&#x27;s properties, including its low density and low cost, have led to a wide range of applications. The inventor of the natural latex rubber balloon, (the most common balloon) was Michael Faraday in 1824, via experiments with air and various gases.

====Inflatable castles====
Inflatable castles and similar structures are temporary inflatable buildings and structures that are rented for functions, school and church festivals and village fetes and used for recreational purposes, mainly by children. The growth in popularity of moonwalks has led to an inflatable rental industry which includes inflatable slides, obstacle courses, games, and more. Inflatables are ideal for portable amusements because they are easy to transport and store.

====Inflatable boat====

An inflatable boat is a lightweight boat constructed with its sides and bow made of flexible tubes containing pressurised gas. For smaller boats, the floor and hull beneath it is often flexible. On boats longer than , the floor often consists of three to five rigid plywood or aluminium sheets fixed between the tubes but not joined rigidly together. Often the transom is rigid, providing a location and structure for mounting an outboard motor.

Some inflatable boats have been designed to be disassembled and packed into a small volume, so they can easily be stored and transported to water when needed. Here the boat when inflated is kept rigid crossways by a foldable removable thwart. This feature allows such boats to be used as liferafts for larger boats or aircraft, and for travel or recreational purposes.

Other terms for inflatable boats are &quot;inflatable dinghy&quot;, &quot;rubber dinghy&quot;, &quot;inflatable&quot;, or &quot;inflatable rescue boat&quot;.

====Pneumatic tire====

A tire (in American English and Canadian English) or tyre (in British English, New Zealand English, Australian English and others) is a ring-shaped covering that fits around a wheel rim to protect it and enable better vehicle performance by providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock while keeping the wheel in close contact with the ground. The word itself may be derived from the word &quot;tie,&quot; which refers to the outer steel ring part of a wooden cart wheel that ties the wood segments together (see Etymology below).

The fundamental materials of modern tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric and wire, along with other compound chemicals. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides traction while the body ensures support. Before rubber was invented, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels in order to prevent wear and tear. Today, the vast majority of tires are pneumatic inflatable structures, comprising a doughnut-shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an inflatable cushion. Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, such as bicycles, motorcycles, cars, trucks, earthmovers, and aircraft.

====Air-supported structure====
An air-supported (or air-inflated) structure is any permanent building that derives its structural integrity from the use of internal pressurized air to inflate a pliable material (i.e. structural fabric) envelope, so that air is the main support of the structure. It is usually dome-shaped, since this shape creates the greatest volume for the least amount of material. However, rectangular inflatables are also possible, such as the &quot;Airtecture Exhibition Hall&quot; constructed by Festo AG &amp; Co.

The concept was popularized on a large scale by David H. Geiger with the United States pavilion at Expo &#x27;70 in Osaka, Japan in 1970.

To maintain structural integrity, the structure must be pressurized such that the internal pressure equals or exceeds any external pressure being applied to the structure (i.e. wind pressure). The structure does not have to be airtight to retain structural integrity—as long as the pressurization system that supplies internal pressure replaces any air leakage, the structure will remain stable. All access to the structure interior must be equipped with two sets of doors or revolving door (airlock). Air-supported structures are secured by heavy weights on the ground, ground anchors, attached to a foundation, or a combination of these.

====Inflatables for entertainment====
The original inflatable game was the Moonwalk (bounce house). Today there are a wide variety of inflatable games that come in all shapes and sizes. Many inflatable games put people in head-to-head competition with other people such as the bungee run and gladiator joust. There are also several inflatable obstacle courses available. Because of their large size, most obstacle courses consist of two or more inflatables connected together.

There are also several variations on sports games which are made portable thanks to inflatables. A sports cage is an inflatable cage that holds up a backdrop that resembles a sport (e.g., baseball, American football, soccer, golf) in which you throw, toss, hit or kick a ball at a marked spot on the backdrop. The cage not only holds the backdrop but keeps balls from flying everywhere. Some sports cages come with a radar gun that will tell you the speed of your throw or kick.

====Decorative inflatables====

During the 2000s, inflatables have replaced the plastic blow-molded yard decorations used as Christmas decorations at many U.S. homes, and are also now used as Halloween decorations and for other occasions as well.

These are made of a synthetic fabric, of which different colors have been sewn together in various patterns. An electric blower constantly forces air into the figure, replacing air lost through its fabric and seams. They are internally lit by small C7 incandescent light bulbs (also used in nightlights), which are covered by translucent plastic snap-on globes that protect the fabric from the heat if they should rest against it.

Inflatables come in various sizes, commonly four feet or 1.2 meters tall (operated with a low-voltage DC power supply and a computer fan), and six or eight feet (1.8 to 2.4 meters) tall, running directly from AC mains electricity. Like inflatable rides, outdoor types are staked to the ground with guy wires (usually synthetic rope or flat straps) to keep them upright in the wind, though being rather flimsy this does not always work. Heavy snow or rainwater which has accumulated may also prevent proper inflation.

While these store compactly, there are disadvantages, including the large amount of electricity needed to constantly keep them inflated. While they can be turned off in the daytime, this leaves the figure deflated, and subject to the rain and snow problem. Freezing rain, heavy snow, or high winds may also cause inflatables to collapse. Additionally, like a tent, they must be completely dry before being packed for storage, or mildew may be a problem (especially if kept in a basement).

Decorative inflatables can be mended using duct tape or rip stock patching tape. Since these materials are now available in colors, matching the patch to the inflatable is not difficult.

Decorative inflatables are made in many popular characters, including Santa Claus and snowmen for Christmas, and ghosts and jack-o-lanterns for Halloween. Several trademarked characters are also produced, including SpongeBob SquarePants, Winnie the Pooh, and Snoopy and Woodstock from &quot;Peanuts&quot;. There are also walk-through arches and &quot;haunted houses&quot; for children, and items for other holidays like Uncle Sam for Independence Day, and palm trees for backyard summer cookouts.

Since 2005, there are also inflatable snow globes which blow tiny styrofoam beads around on the inside, the blower&#x27;s air jet picking them up and through a tube to the top, where they fall down inside the clear vinyl front. On others, mainly for Halloween, lightweight foam bats or ghosts spin around like confetti in what is called a &quot;tornado globe&quot;. The figures inside both types are also inflatables.

Since 2006, several of these have motion, which is driven by the air itself and the Venturi effect. The original is a merry-go-round (usually surrounded by clear vinyl for support), another from 2007 is an airplane with moving propeller. Ghosts may also have streamers which blow around where the air escapes.

Inflatables have been made by visual artists and displayed in prominent places in Australia, including on the water in Sydney Harbor and in the sky over the city of Canberra. Examples include &quot;Alphie the Alpha Turtle&quot; and Patricia Piccinini&#x27;s &quot;The Skywhale&quot;.

====Structural inflatables====

Airbeams, inflatable spars, inflatable wings, and tensairity-enhanced inflatable bladders provide a means to structure practical objects.

Inflatable ballute structures have been proposed for use during aerocapture, aerobraking and atmospheric entry of cubesat and nanosat satellites. The inflatable structures for these applications may take a variety of engineered shapes including stacked toroidal, tension cone and isotensoid ballute form factors.

Inflatable space habitats have been proposed since the 1960s and one expandable space station is currently planned for launch in 2015.

===Examples===
Typical examples of an inflatable include the inflatable movie screen, inflatable boat, the balloon, the airship, evacuation slide, furniture, kites, and numerous air-filled swimming pool toys. Air beams as structural elements are finding increasing applications.

Smaller-scale inflatables (such as pool toys) generally consist of one or more &quot;air chambers&quot;, which are hollow enclosures bound by a soft and flexible airtight material (such as vinyl), which a gas can enter into or leave from through valves (usually one on each air chamber). The design dependence upon an enclosed pocket of gas leads to a need for a very durable surface material and/or ease of repair of tears and holes on the material, since a puncture or tear will result in the escape of the gas inside (a leak) and the deflation of the inflatable, which depends on the gas&#x27;s pressure to hold its form. Detectable leaks can be caused by holes (from punctures or tears) on the material, the separating of seams, the separating of valve parts, or an improperly shut or improperly closing valve. Even if an inflatable possesses no macroscopic leaks, the gas inside will usually diffuse out of the inflatable, albeit at a much slower rate, until equilibrium is reached with the pressure outside the inflatable.

Many inflatables are made of material that does not stretch upon inflation; a notable exception of this is the balloon, whose rubber stretches greatly when inflated.

The airship is usually inflated with helium as it is lighter than air and does not burn unlike hydrogen airships such as the Hindenburg.

Inflatables are also used for the construction of specific sports pitches, military quick-assembly tents, camping tent air beams, and noise makers. Inflatable aircraft including the Goodyear Inflatoplane have been used. Inflation by dynamic ram-air is providing wings for hang gliding and paragliding.

Inflatables came very much into the public eye as architectural and domestic objects when synthetic materials became commonplace. Iconic structures like the US Pavilion at the 1970 Osaka Expo by Davis and Brody and Victor Lundy&#x27;s travelling pavilion for the Atomic Energy Commission popularized the idea that inflatables can be a way to build large structures with very extended interior spans without pillars. These great hopes for inflatable structures would later be dashed by the many practical difficulties faced by inflatable buildings, such as climatization, safety, sensitivity to wind and fireproofing that, currently, restrict their use to very specific circumstances.

The DVD &quot;Ant Farm&quot; has directions for making your own inflatables, using plastic bags and an iron. The low technological barrier to building inflatables is further lowered by DIY instruction sets like the Inflatocookbook.

A patent was granted in Australia in 2001 for a &quot;Manually portable and inflatable automobile&quot; (Australian Patent Number 2001100029), however no known practical form of this type of inflatable has yet been commercialised.

Large scale low-pressure inflatables are often seen at festivals as decorations or inflatable games. These are made out of rip stop nylon and have a constant flow of air from a blower inflating them.

In some cases, an inflatable roof is added to an otherwise traditional structure: the biggest example in the world was the BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia. Another example can be found in the Roman amphitheater of Nîmes.

Many companies use inflatables in the shape of their product or service; they do this because no permission is needed to display them from a local council or authority and they are easily moved from place to place.

Inflatables have been used prominently in works of art by artists such as Paul Chan (artist), Martin Creed, John Jasperse, Jeff Koons, and Andy Warhol.

<text>Jean Luc Joseph Marie &quot;Jean-Luc&quot; Dehaene (; 7 August 1940 – 15 May 2014) was a Belgian politician who served as the prime minister of Belgium from 1992 until 1999. During his political career, he was nicknamed &quot;The Plumber&quot;, as well as &quot;The Minesweeper&quot;, for his ability to negotiate political deadlocks.

A member of the &quot;Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams&quot; (CD&amp;V) party and its antecedents, Dehaene gained his first ministerial appointment in 1981. Dehaene&#x27;s first government (1992–1995) included both Christian and Social Democrats and presided over the creation of a new constitution, effectively transforming Belgium into a federal state. His second government (1995–1999) coincided with a number of crises in Belgium including the Dutroux scandal. The Dioxin Affair, occurring shortly before the 1999 election, led to a swing against the major parties and Dehaene&#x27;s government fell.

Following his final term as prime minister he was active in both Belgian and European politics. He was also on UEFA&#x27;s financial fair play regulatory body and managed Dexia Bank during the financial crisis. He was the last prime minister of King Baudouin&#x27;s reign.

==Early life and political career==
Dehaene was born on 7 August 1940 in Montpellier, France, when his parents were fleeing the advance of the German army into Belgium and France. During his studies at the Université de Namur and the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, he was a member of the Olivaint Conference of Belgium. He got into politics through the &quot;&quot; (General Christian Workers&#x27; Union; ACW), a trade union which was closely linked to the &quot;Christelijke Volkspartij&quot; (Christian People&#x27;s Party; CVP).

Dehaene&#x27;s long-time wife Celie Verbeke is a native of Illinois in the United States but both her paternal and maternal grandparents were Belgian immigrants. Since she was raised by her parents in Dutch and speaks without a foreign accent, the Belgian public remained unaware of her American background for a long time.

Dehaene was a keen football fan, and viewed it as an important part of Belgian national identity. He was a supporter of Club Brugge K.V. In 1981, he became Minister of Social Affairs and Institutional Reform, until 1988, when he became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Communications and Institutional Reform.

==Prime Minister of Belgium==

===Dehaene I (1992–95)===

In 1992, after both Guy Verhofstadt and Melchior Wathelet had failed, Dehaene managed to form a governing coalition of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats. This became one of Belgium&#x27;s most important governments, because it successfully transformed Belgium into a federal state in 1993. In March 1993, Dehaene offered the King the resignation of his government, because of diverging views on how to handle the public finances. However, within a week the differences were put aside.

After the death of King Baudouin on 31 July 1993, Dehaene&#x27;s government exercised the royal function until Prince Albert was sworn in as King Albert II nine days later.

In 1994, Dehaene ordered the unilateral withdrawal of Belgian troops from Rwanda following the massacre of a number of Belgian peacekeepers, thus lifting the last barrier to the genocide of Tutsis. During questions from the Belgian parliamentary commission into this decision he repeatedly acknowledged no regrets about the decision. He was the leading candidate to replace Jacques Delors as President of the European Commission, but British Prime Minister John Major vetoed the appointment. The Luxembourg Prime Minister Jacques Santer was appointed as a compromise candidate instead.

===Dehaene II (1995–99)===

Dehaene&#x27;s second government was also composed of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats. Despite the fact that the government was marked by a number of political crises and scandals, most notably the Dutroux affair, it managed to serve the entire legislature. During this period, for his work toward a unified Europe, Dehaene received the Vision for Europe Award in 1996. Dehaene led Belgium into the Euro, and in preparation for joining the Eurozone, the Dehaene government was forced to make some sharp and unpopular economic reforms. Some weeks before the 1999 elections the dioxin affair erupted, and both governing parties lost much of their support. He was replaced by a new government, led by Flemish liberal Guy Verhofstadt.

==After 1999==

===Later political career===
Between 2000 and 2007, he sat as Burgemeester (mayor) of Vilvoorde. At the request of his party, the CD&amp;V, he was once again put up as a candidate during the 2003 elections, but this was clearly not with the intention of becoming prime minister as he was placed as the last person on the party list (Lijstduwer). In June 2004 and again in June 2009, Jean-Luc Dehaene was elected to the European Parliament for the CD&amp;V within the center-right European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) group. In 2003, he was awarded the Vlerick Award.

Between 2006 and 2007, Dehaene served as member of the Amato Group, a group of high-level European politicians unofficially working on rewriting the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe into what became known as the Treaty of Lisbon following its rejection by French and Dutch voters. After the Belgian elections of 2007, Dehaene was appointed as mediator in the process to form a new government. He was also called in to assist in the negotiations around the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde partition.

===UEFA Financial Fair Play===

Dehaene also served as the chief enforcer of the football association, UEFA&#x27;s, Financial Fair Play (FFP). In 2011, he was involved in an investigation of Manchester City F.C. over sponsorship irregularities.

===Dexia===
Dehaene, who had previously been director of InBev, became chairman of Dexia Bank, a Belgian-French bank, in October 2008. With the bank in difficulty owing to the financial crisis, he was asked to lead the company through the difficult period which he described as &quot;mission impossible&quot;. Owing to his extensive political background, it was thought that he could cope with the negative public perception Dexia had acquired through the financial crisis. His political connections helped Dexia&#x27;s bad bank to secure funding guarantees of up to €90 billion, provided primarily by the Belgian government. In 2012, Dexia Belgium became Belfius.

==Death==
On 15 May 2014, Dehaene died after a fall while holidaying in Quimper in France. He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer earlier the same year and was not seeking reelection as an MEP in the 2014 elections for health reasons. He was 73 years old.

In the aftermath of his death, he received tributes from the incumbent Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo who described him as an &quot;exceptional statesman&quot;. Tributes were also made by Guy Verhofstadt, President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz and President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso.

His body lay in state in Vilvoorde&#x27;s town hall and the retired King Albert II and the Flemish Minister-President Kris Peeters both visited Vilvoorde to pay their respects.

==Honours==
*: Minister of State, by Royal Decree.
*: Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown. 
*: Grand Cross in the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.
