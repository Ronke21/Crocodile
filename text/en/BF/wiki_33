<text>Cotabato, formerly and still commonly referred to as North Cotabato and officially the Province of Cotabato, is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Soccsksargen region in Mindanao. Its capital is the city of Kidapawan, the most populous in the province. Some of its municipalities are under the jurisdiction of the nearby Bangsamoro Autonomous Region.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Kuta Watu&quot; in Maguindanaon (or &quot;Kota Batu&quot; in Malay) means &quot;stone fortress&quot;.

==History==
===Maguindanao Sultanate===
According to Maguindanao royal records, Islam was introduced to the Maguindanaos in the late 15th century by Sharif Muhammad Kabungsuan, a Johorean Malay Muslim noble and missionary of Arab descent. Sharif Kabungsuan invaded Malabang in 1475, facing armed resistance from the principality, nevertheless successfully vanquishing and subjugating it to his Islamic rule through the employment of Samal forces.

Cotabato became the capital of the Maguindanao Sultanate. The city became the seat of power of Sultan Muhammad Kudarat in 1619.

===Spanish invasion===
Christianity was introduced in 1596, but the Spaniards were unable to penetrate into the region until the second half of the 19th century. The district of Cotabato was formed in 1860, covering the areas of what is now Cotabato, Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, and Sultan Kudarat provinces with its capital at Tamontaka. &quot;Fort Pikit&quot; was established by the Spaniards in 1893 as they continued their conquest of the remnants of Maguindanao Sultanate, which would soon be the site of one of the province&#x27;s oldest towns, Pikit.

===American rule===
The coming of the Americans ushered in the creation of the Moro Province on July 15, 1903, through &quot;Act No. 787&quot; of the Philippine Commission. Cotabato, covering what are now the provinces of Cotabato, Maguindanao del Norte, Maguindanao del Sur, Sultan Kudarat, South Cotabato and Sarangani, became a district of the huge Moro province. During the American period, large companies were established in Cotabato to exploit the vast timber resources of the region. By the 1930s, settlers from Luzon and Visayas established homesteads in Cotabato.

===Japanese invasion===

In December 1941, Japanese planes bombed and invaded Cotabato. In 1942, Cotabato was occupied by the Japanese Imperial forces. A military headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army existed in Cotabato from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the Philippine Constabulary 10th Constabulary Regiment was stationed in Cotobato from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946. Moro guerrilla fighters operating in the province of Cotabato helped local forces of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Philippine Constabulary 10th Constabulary Regiment fight against the Imperial Japanese Army until 1944. The Moro guerrillas fought the Japanese troops until liberation. In 1945, Cotabato was recaptured from the Japanese Imperial forces by the combined Filipino and American troops together with the recognized Moro guerrilla units. The guerrillas used the traditional Moro Kampilan, Barong and Kris swords as their weapons.

===Postwar Era===
The pace of settlement in the region accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s. The former province of Cotabato was once the largest in the Philippines. In 1966, South Cotabato was created as a separate province.

Mindanao, including Cotabato, was relatively peaceful in the 1950s and the mid-1960s. While there were some ethnic tensions, there was essentially no presence of secessionist groups in Mindanao yet.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===

The relative peace of the postwar era began to change in the last years of President Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; first term, when news about the Jabidah massacre ignited a furor in the Moro community, and ethnic tensions encouraged with the formation of secessionist movements. None of these groups had enough followers to form a viable opposition until Marcos declared Martial Law, but when political parties were dissolved upon the proclamation of Martial Law in September 1972, it became easy for the armed secessionist group known as the Moro National Liberation Front to consolidate power, and the decades-long Moro conflict began in earnest.

One major event of Martial law which took place in Cotabato was the Manili massacre, which saw the mass murder of 70 to 79 Moros, including women and children, committed in a mosque in Manili, Carmen, North Cotabato, Philippines on June 19, 1971. The Muslim residents of the town had gathered in their mosque to participate in a supposed peace talk with Christian groups when a group of armed men suspected to be part of the Ilaga militant group opened fire on them.

On November 22, 1973, through &quot;Presidential Decree No. 341&quot;, what remained of the old Cotabato was further divided into the provinces of &quot;North Cotabato&quot;, Maguindanao, and Sultan Kudarat. &quot;North Cotabato&quot; was later renamed &quot;Cotabato&quot; through &quot;Batas Pambansa Blg. 660&quot; approved on March 7, 1984.

===Post-1986=== 
By the aftermath of the plebiscite to form the autonomous administrative region of Bangsamoro in February 2019, 63 barangays from Cotabato&#x27;s western municipalities, all of which inhabited mostly by Muslim natives, opted to join the newly formed region. This will result in the reduction of the number of barangays the province currently administers after the national midterm elections on May 13, 2019.
Cotabato now comprises the capital city of Kidapawan and 25 municipalities.

==Geography==

Cotabato covers a total area of occupying the northeastern tip of Region XII and is centrally located in Mindanao. It is bounded on the north by the provinces of Lanao del Sur and Bukidnon, on the east by Davao City and Davao del Norte, on the west by Maguindanao del Norte and Maguindanao del Sur, on the south by Sultan Kudarat, and on the southeast by Davao del Sur.

Cotabato is strategically linked to the major &quot;Arterial Road System&quot; that traverses and connects the province to Davao City - Soccsksargen - Cotabato Corridor. The Cotabato via Kabacan - Maramag - Kibawe, Bukidnon Sayre Highway meanwhile serves as its link to the Cagayan de Oro-Iligan City Corridor. The Pan-Philippine Highway (AH26) traverses through the municipalities of Midsayap, Libungan and the Pigcawayan.

Cotabato stretches from the east at Mount Apo, which separates it from Davao, to the Piapayungan Range on its boundary with Lanao in the west. Between these highlands is the basin of the Pulangi River or Rio Grande de Mindanao, the second longest in the Philippines at , which rises in Bukidnon and flows south to Maguindanao and Illana Bay. The province&#x27;s fertile plains are traversed by tributaries of this great river.

Typhoons do not pass through Cotabato and rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year.

==Administrative divisions==

Cotabato comprises 25 municipalities and one city. However, 8 municipalities are under the jurisdiction of Bangsamoro as part of its special geographic area.


===Reduction due to the establishment of the Bangsamoro===
During the 2001 Referendum for inclusion to the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, 2 out of 28 barangays of Carmen, Cotabato chose to be part of ARMM, but were excluded because they are not connected to the main region of ARMM. During 2010-2016 Administration, the Bangsamoro ideal sprouted and a newly proposed region was in the making. According to the agreements signed by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Administration of Noynoy Aquino, Carmen will be included in Bangsamoro because of the two out of twenty-eight barangays that voted in favor of joining the Muslim region back in 2001. Unfortunately, Bangsamoro was not implemented before the term of Aquino ended. Despite this, the current administration aims to establish a Federal Government, where Bangamoro will be realized into a State of the Philippines wherein Carmen will be included in Bangsamoro.

Plans to establish a new municipality in the south of Carmen so that the indigenous and Christian central and northern part of Carmen will be retained in North Cotabato has yet to be confirmed. The idea arose because once the entire municipality of Carmen is included in Bangsamoro, the province of North Cotabato will be cut into half, leaving three towns (Banisilan, Alamada, and Libungan) at its west without connection to the center of North Cotabato, isolating these towns in the process.

The issue was partially resolved when the second part of the plebiscite was conducted on February 6, 2019, when 63 barangay from the towns of Pigkawayan, Libungan, Midsayap, Aleosan, Carmen, Banisilan and Pikit opted to join the new administrative autonomous region of Bangsamoro after the results of the region&#x27;s formation plebiscite were confirmed three days later on February 9. These barangays are to join either the adjacent province of Maguindanao as parts of the said province&#x27;s nearby and respective municipalities or to cluster on their own as new municipalities within the said province after the national midterm elections on May 13, 2019. The size and population of Cotabato province had officially diminished on November 20, 2019, as the barangays which voted to join the Bangsamoro made their exit from the province and their respective mother municipalities and were officially turned over to the Bangsamoro government as an interim province within the autonomous region divided into several clusters.

==Demographics==


Based on the 2020 census, Cotabato has an overall population of 1,275,185. The average population growth rate was 2.27% in the period 2010–2015, which is higher than the national average of 1.72%. The province had a density of .

Cotabato is an ethnolinguistically diverse province. The first Visayan settlers reached the town of Pikit in 1913, and since then, Christian migrants have moved and lived in Cotabato, cohabitating the province with the local indigenous groups. 71% of Cotabato&#x27;s population descended from settlers who migrated from the Visayas and Luzon, while the remaining 18% belong to the communities of Magindanaons, Iranuns, Ilianens, Dulangan Manobo, Obo, Tagabawa, and Tboli. The major languages spoken are Hiligaynon (46%), Maguindanao (38%), Cebuano (8%), and Ilocano (4%).

==Economy==

Cotabato is considered a major food basket in Mindanao. It is a top producer of cereals, tropical fruits, vegetables, sugarcane, coconut, coffee, freshwater fish and livestock.

It is also one of the country&#x27;s leading producers of raw and semi-processed rubber and industrial trees, with markets in Asia and Europe.

Among its major natural assets are Mt. Apo, the country&#x27;s highest peak at above sea level, the Pulangi River which is a major contributor to Mindanao&#x27;s irrigation system and hydro-electric energy, and the vast Liguasan Marsh which not only supplies a bounty of freshwater fish and organic fertilizer but considered as a possible source as well of natural gas.

Power utility in the province comes from two energy sources - the &quot;NAPOCOR Agus Grid&quot; in Iligan transmitted through its Tacurong Substations and the Mount Apo Geothermal Power Plant at the foot of Mt. Apo in Ilomavis, Kidapawan City which produces 97 megawatts of electricity. Power distribution is handled by Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc. (COTELCO).

The province has a road network connecting the major centers to each other and the outlying barangays, and communication linkage through NDD-IDD, fax, cellular phone and the internet is available.

<text>Autecology is an approach in ecology that seeks to explain the distribution and abundance of species by studying interactions of individual organisms with their environments. An autecological approach differs from ecosystem ecology, community ecology (synecology) and population ecology (demecology) by greater recognition of the species-specific adaptations of individual animals, plants or other organisms, and of environmental over density-dependent influences on species distributions. Autecological theory relates the species-specific requirements and environmental tolerances of individuals to the geographic distribution of the species, with individuals tracking suitable conditions, having the capacity for migration at at least one stage in their life cycles. Autecology has a strong grounding in evolutionary theory, including the theory of punctuated equilibrium and the recognition concept of species.

== History ==
Autecology was pioneered by German field botanists in the late 19th century. During the 20th century, autecology continued to exist mainly as a descriptive science rather than one with supporting theory and the most notable proponents of an autecological approach, Herbert Andrewartha and Charles Birch, avoided the term autecology when referring to species-focused ecological investigation with emphasis on density-independent processes. Part of the problem with deriving a theoretical structure for autecology is that individual species are unique in their life history and behaviour, making it difficult to draw broad generalisations across them without losing the crucial information that is gained by studying biology at a species level. Progress has been made in more recent times with Paterson&#x27;s recognition concept of species and the concept of habitat tracking by organisms. The most recent attempt at deriving a theoretical structure for autecology was published in 2014 by ecologists Gimme Walter and Rob Hengeveld.

== Basic theory ==

=== Recognition concept ===
Autecological theory is focused on species as the most important unit of biological organisation, as individuals across all populations of a particular species share species-specific adaptations that influence their ecology. This particularly relates to reproduction, as individuals of a sexual species share unique adaptations (e.g. courtship songs, pheromones) for recognising potential mates, and share a fertilisation mechanism that differs from those in all other species. This recognition concept of species differs from the biological species concept (or isolation concept) which defines species by cross-mating sterility, which in allopatric speciation is merely a consequence of adaptive change in a new species&#x27; fertilisation mechanism to suit a different environment.

=== Environmental matching ===
Individuals from across a species&#x27; range tend to be relatively uniform in terms of their dietary and habitat requirements and the range of environmental conditions they can tolerate. These differ from those of other species. Individuals of a species likewise share specific sensory adaptations for recognising suitable habitat. Seasonal changes and variability in climate mean that the spatial and/or temporal distribution of suitable habitat for a species also varies. In response, organisms track suitable conditions, for example by migrating in order to remain within suitable habitat, for which there is evidence in the fossil record. By determining the requirements and tolerances of a particular species, it is possible to predict how individuals of that species will respond to specific environmental changes 

=== Population sizes and replacement level reproduction ===
Autecological theory predicts that populations will reproduce at around replacement level unless a period of environmental change causing unusually high or low survival causes the population to grow or shrink before restabilising at replacement level again. Population numbers may be reduced by introduction of new predation pressure, such as with poor fisheries management or introduction of a biological control agent to control an invasive species, such that net reproductive rate, R0, drops below replacement level. The species being preyed upon in each case may stabilise at a lower population density where it is more difficult for individuals of the higher trophic level to locate the prey species, but at this point relieving predation tends to make little difference to population size, as individuals continue to reproduce around replacement level as they were at a higher density prior to the introduction of a higher trophic level.

== Applications ==

=== Pest management ===
Pests include animals or agents that cause economic damage to cultivated crops. Pest management refers to the techniques and methods applied to control or minimize the damage to the crops done by pests. Pest management may include chemical, mechanical, biological or integrated approach. To apply any type of effective management programme, it is of utmost importance to know in detail about the particular pest species. Special study of the ecology of the pest provide necessary clues to its management.

=== Biological control ===
=== Conservation autecology ===
Knowledge of species-level interactions, tolerances and habitat requirements is valuable for conservation of an endangered plant or animal species by ensuring its particular ecological requirements are met.

== Links to other fields ==
With focus on individual organism, autecology has mechanistic links to several other biological fields, including ethology, evolution, genetics and physiology

<doc id="297408" wikidata="Q7172213" url="?curid=297408" title="Pete Reiser">
<text>Harold Patrick Reiser (March 17, 1919 – October 25, 1981), nicknamed &quot;Pistol Pete&quot;, was an American professional baseball outfielder and coach, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB), during the 1940s and early 1950s. While known primarily for his time with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Reiser later played for the Boston Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Cleveland Indians.

==Early career==
A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Reiser signed with his hometown Cardinals, but at age 19 he was among a group of minor league players declared free agents by Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Reportedly, Cardinal general manager Branch Rickey—mortified at losing a player of Reiser&#x27;s caliber—arranged for the Dodgers to sign Reiser, hide him in the minors, then trade him back to St. Louis at a later date. But Reiser&#x27;s stellar performances in spring training in both 1939 and 1940 forced the Dodgers to keep him. (Rickey would become GM of the Dodgers after the 1942 season and witness Reiser&#x27;s injury-caused decline as a great talent.)

===Derailed by injuries===
In 1941, his first season as a regular starter, Reiser helped the Dodgers win the pennant for the first time since 1920. A sensation his second year, he won the National League batting title while leading the league in doubles, triples, total bases, runs scored, and slugging percentage. He was also named a starter to the All-Star team and placed second in MVP balloting. On July 19 of the following year, Reiser crashed face-first into the outfield wall in St. Louis, trying to catch what turned out to be a game-winning inside-the-park home run by Enos Slaughter of the rival Cardinals in the bottom of the 11th inning. The loss cut the Dodgers&#x27; lead over the Cardinals to six games.

Despite missing just four games with the resulting concussion, he batted only .244 over his final 48 games that season, dropping his batting average from .350 to .310 for the year. The Dodgers ended up losing the pennant by two games to the Cardinals, who won 20 of their last 23 games and eventually the World Series.

Reiser gave great effort on every play in the field, and was therefore very injury-prone. He fractured his skull running into an outfield wall on one occasion (but still made the throw back to the infield), was temporarily paralyzed on another, and was taken off the field on a stretcher nearly a dozen times.

Leo Durocher, who was Reiser&#x27;s first major league manager, reflected many years later that in terms of talent, skill and potential, there was only one other player comparable to Reiser: Willie Mays. He also said, &quot;Pete had more power than Willie—left-handed and right-handed both. Willie had everything, Pete had everything but luck.&quot;

Reiser served in the United States Army during World War II, playing baseball for Army teams. While serving, he was injured again and had to learn to throw with both arms.

When Reiser returned to the majors in 1946, he was still suffering from a shoulder injury from playing Army baseball. He later said: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t as serious as the head injuries, but it did more to end my career. The shoulder kept popping out of place, more bone chips developed, and there was constant pain in the arm and shoulder.&quot;

He was never the same hitter he was early in his career, but was still as fast as ever, leading the NL in stolen bases and stealing home a record seven times in 1946. In 1948, Ebbets Field became the first ballpark with padded outfield walls due to Reiser&#x27;s penchant for running into them.

==Later life==
Reiser managed in the minors for several years (including the Kokomo Dodgers in 1956–57, among others), winning the 1959 Minor League Manager of the Year Award from &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. He served as a coach on Los Angeles Dodger manager Walter Alston&#x27;s staff from 1960 to 1964 (including the 1963 world championship team). However, he was forced out in 1965 as manager of the AAA Spokane Indians as the result of a heart attack. His replacement was Duke Snider—the man who had once replaced him as Brooklyn Dodger center fielder.

When Leo Durocher became manager of the Chicago Cubs in 1966, he brought many of his former players to coach on his staff. Reiser was one of them (1966–1969; 1972–1974). He also coached for the California Angels in 1970–71.

In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.&quot; They used what they called &quot;Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome&quot; to explain why a truly exceptional player whose career was curtailed by injury—despite not having had career statistics that would rank him with the all-time greats—should nonetheless be included on their list.

Reiser died in Palm Springs, California, of respiratory disease at 62, and was buried at Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.

<doc id="297410" wikidata="Q5460098" url="?curid=297410" title="Flooding (Australian football)">
<text>Flooding is a tactic used in the sport of Australian rules football. It involves the coach releasing players in the forward line from their set positions and directing them to the opposition forward area, congesting the area and making it more difficult for the opposition to score. It is commonly deployed to protect a lead, to stop a rout or as a counterattack tactic based on rebounding the ball to an open forward line. This is possible due to the lack of an offside rule or similar restrictions on players field movements.

==History==

When Australian Football took to the parks around the colony of Victoria in 1858, there were no rules regarding player positions. Even today the rules only declare that a maximum of four per side is allowed in the centre square at the ball-up (ruck, rover, ruck-rover and centre) and 6 must start within each 50m arc, while during general play, all players are free to position themselves as they see fit. In early years this resulted in a pack of players moving with the ball up and down the field trying to get a clearing kick into space that the pack would then run into and repeat the process. Such a process is still evident in some junior leagues (the under 8 years old children) and is known as &quot;beehive football&quot;. It was not until 1898 that player positions became regular thanks to Essendon&#x27;s now famous positions of players around the field. The positioning provided many lopsided contests against teams trying to play pack football, such as beating St Kilda 10.11 (71) to 1.9 (15) on July 23 and Melbourne 11.9 (75) to 2.8 (20) on August 1 in 1898. Other teams mimicked the idea and the &quot;lines of three&quot; quickly became, and still is, the norm.

One of the earliest records of flooding comes from an 1860s match between the Geelong Football Club and the Ballarat Football Club in Ballarat. Goalless and kicking against the gale, Geelong captain Tom Wills ordered every player into the backline. The Ballarat fans yelled abuse. Melbourne Football Club later successfully copied the tactic.

In VFL football times, the 1909 VFL Grand Final in which South Melbourne, mindful of a Carlton side which beat them in round 11 after trailing 0.11 to South&#x27;s 4.4 at half-time, packed the arc in the Grand Final after half time to thwart Carlton&#x27;s advance. South won the final by two points.

Over the years many teams have put extra men in the defensive 50 metre zone to stifle attacks, usually to stop great full-forwards or protect a lead. It was not uncommon for forwards such as Gordon Coventry, John Coleman, Tony Lockett, Jason Dunstall and Gary Ablett Sr., among others, to be seen fighting off three defenders to take a mark. Flooding the defensive zone outright was a rarity due to the level of endurance required from the entire team. However it was used defensively on occasion to avoid a rout.

==Flooding in modern professional football==
As football at the elite level increased in professionalism and athleticism, the practice increased.

===As an offensive tactic===
Flooding first became an offensive tactic when Rodney Eade became the Sydney Swans head coach in 1996. In order to give star forward Tony Lockett the most room on the small Sydney Cricket Ground he had the team play an extra &quot;line of three&quot; in defence when the opposition had the ball, creating a set-up with 9 defenders, 6 midfielders and three forwards. The idea was to create a forced error and turn-over, followed by swift movement to Lockett who had ample space to lead into. This was similar to Denis Pagan&#x27;s &quot;Pagan&#x27;s Paddock&quot; which gave Wayne Carey wide space to manoeuvre in. The Swans used this tactic to great effect in 1996, reaching the Grand Final, and, under Eade&#x27;s successor Paul Roos, subsequently winning in 2005 despite some early criticism which arose from the tactics backfiring in a match against midway through the season.

===As a defensive tactic===
Terry Wallace became infamous for the &quot;Super-Flood&quot; that he employed in the Round 21 game between the Western Bulldogs and Essendon at Colonial Stadium in 2000. Wallace successfully quelled the Bombers&#x27; scoring power and defeated the team which had won the previous 20 games by playing 14 of the 18 men on the field in the defensive zone for the entirety of the game, and often with all 18 players taking up positions in the 50 metre arc.

In 2002, with a depleted side at his disposal, coach Grant Thomas implemented an extraordinary game plan in a match against which involved flooding the Swans&#x27; forward line and continually denying them the ball by kicking towards the boundary line when there were few options forward. The result was an 8.8 (56)–all draw, with Nick Riewoldt winning an AFL Rising Star nomination (and eventually winning the award at season&#x27;s end) for his breakout performance.

<text>Antônio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim (25 January 1927 – 8 December 1994), also known as Tom Jobim (), was a Brazilian composer, pianist, guitarist, songwriter, arranger, and singer. Considered as one of the great exponents of Brazilian music, Jobim merged samba with cool jazz in the 1960s to create bossa nova, with worldwide success. As a result, he is regarded as one of the fathers of bossa nova, and as one of the most-celebrated songwriters of the 20th century.

Jobim was a primary force behind the creation of the bossa nova style, and his songs have been performed by many singers and instrumentalists internationally since the early 1960s.

In 1965, the album &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; was the first jazz record to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. It also won Best Jazz Instrumental Album – Individual or Group and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. The album&#x27;s single &quot;Garota de Ipanema (The Girl from Ipanema)&quot;, composed by Jobim, has become one of the most recorded songs of all time, and the album won the Record of the Year. Jobim composed many songs that are now included in jazz and pop standard repertoires. &quot;Garota de Ipanema&quot; has been recorded over 240 times by other artists. His 1967 album with Frank Sinatra, &quot;Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antônio Carlos Jobim&quot;, was nominated for Album of the Year in 1968.

==Early life==
Antônio Carlos Jobim was born at 23:15 BRT on 25 January 1927 in the middle-class district of Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro. His father, Jorge de Oliveira Jobim (São Gabriel, Rio Grande do Sul; 1889–1935), was a writer, diplomat, professor and journalist. He came from a prominent family, being the great-nephew of , senator, privy councillor and physician of Emperor Dom Pedro II. While studying medicine in Europe, José Martins added &quot;Jobim&quot; to his last name, paying homage to the village where his family came from in Portugal, the parish of Santa Cruz de Jovim, Porto. Antônio&#x27;s mother, Nilza Brasileiro de Almeida ( 1910–1989), was of partly indigenous descent from northeastern Brazil. Brasileiro de Almeida was only 16 years old when she gave birth to Antônio Carlos Jobim at their home in Tijuca on Rua Conde de Bonfim.

When Antônio was still an infant, his parents separated and his mother moved with her children (Antônio Carlos and his sister Helena Isaura, born 23 February 1931) to Ipanema, the beachside neighborhood the composer would later celebrate in his songs. In 1935, when the elder Jobim died, Nilza married Celso da Frota Pessoa (died 2 February 1979), who would encourage his stepson&#x27;s career; it was he who gave Jobim his first piano. Jobim credits his stepfather with encouraging him to pursue music. In an interview with Roberto d&#x27;Ávila in 1981, he said, &quot;I hated the piano, I thought it was a girly thing, I liked to play soccer...I had a great stepfather who really helped me get involved with music and convinced me that the piano was not a girly thing.&quot; As a young man of limited means, Jobim earned his living by playing in nightclubs and bars and later as an arranger for a recording label before starting to achieve success as a composer.

Later on in the interview with Roberto d&#x27;Ávila, Jobim talks about his feelings toward his upbringing. He notes a conversation he had with a friend of his father&#x27;s, Erico Verissimo, where Verissimo said that Tom Jobim should be sombre due to the absence of his father from a young age. Jobim told d&#x27;Ávila, &quot;I was left without a father, clinging to my mother&#x27;s skirts…some [men] have &#x27;excessive&#x27; fathers, the excessive presence of their fathers is a problem, but the absence of a father is also a problem.&quot; Jobim continued with d&#x27;Ávila, sharing that it takes something of great influence to bring someone to dedicate their life to music. He said that &quot;people who play the piano well are all handicapped&quot;. He mentions the health struggles of both Sergio Mendes who had osteomyelitis and Luiz Eça who had polio. &quot;It takes something really strong to make you leave reality behind and begin to write songs,&quot; Jobim shared. With d&#x27;Ávila he alludes to his sadness as a young man as being the driving force that motivated him to further his pursuit in music, that he needed to be sad in order to play the piano and write. He concludes on the topic with d&#x27;Ávila that, at that point in his life (the interview having taken place in 1981) that he no longer needed to be sad to create music, that he was no longer sad as he was at the beginning of his career.

===Musical influences===
Jobim&#x27;s musical roots were planted firmly in the work of Pixinguinha, the legendary musician and composer who began modern Brazilian music in the 1930s. Among his teachers were Lúcia Branco and, from 1941 on, Hans-Joachim Koellreutter, a German composer who lived in Brazil and introduced atonal and twelve-tone composition in the country. Jobim&#x27;s mother established a school where Jobim would begin taking lessons on the piano; this is when he would meet Koellreutter. Jobim was also influenced by the French composers Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, and by the Brazilian composers Ary Barroso who has been described as Jobim&#x27;s &quot;most important musical influence&quot;. Among many themes, his lyrics talked about love, self-discovery, betrayal, joy and especially about the birds and natural wonders of Brazil, like the &quot;Mata Atlântica&quot; forest, characters of Brazilian folklore and his home city of Rio de Janeiro. In a segment with the NBC &quot;Today&quot; show in 1986, hosted by Jane Pauley, Jobim spoke about his music&#x27;s origins of inspiration, saying &quot;My music comes from this environment here, you know, the rain, the sun, the trees, the birds, the fish.&quot;

==Career==

In the 1940s Jobim started to play piano in bars and nightclubs of Rio de Janeiro, and in the first years of the 1950s he worked as an arranger in the Continental Studio, where in April 1953 he had his first composition recorded, when the Brazilian singer Mauricy Moura recorded Jobim&#x27;s composition &quot;Incerteza&quot;, with lyrics by Newton Mendonça.

Jobim became prominent in Brazil when he teamed up with poet and diplomat Vinicius de Moraes to write the music for the play &quot;Orfeu da Conceição&quot; (1956). The most popular song from the show was &quot;Se Todos Fossem Iguais A Você&quot; (&quot;If Everyone Were Like You&quot;). Later, when the play was adapted into a film, producer Sacha Gordine did not want to use any of the existing music from the play. Gordine asked de Moraes and Jobim for a new score for the film &quot;Orfeu Negro&quot;, or &quot;Black Orpheus&quot; (1959). Moraes was at the time away in Montevideo, Uruguay, working for the Itamaraty (the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and so he and Jobim were only able to write three songs, primarily over the telephone (&quot;A felicidade&quot;, &quot;Frevo&quot; and &quot;O nosso amor&quot;). This collaboration proved successful, and de Moraes went on to pen the lyrics to some of Jobim&#x27;s most popular songs.

In 1958 the Brazilian singer and guitarist João Gilberto recorded his first album with two of Jobim&#x27;s most famous songs, &quot;Desafinado&quot; and &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot;. This album inaugurated the Bossa Nova movement in Brazil. The sophisticated harmonies of his songs caught the attention of jazz musicians in the United States, principally after his first performance at Carnegie Hall, in 1962.

A key event in making Jobim&#x27;s music known in the English-speaking world was his collaboration with the American jazz saxophonist Stan Getz, the Brazilian singer João Gilberto, and Gilberto&#x27;s wife at the time, Astrud Gilberto, which resulted in two albums, &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; (1963) and &quot;Getz/Gilberto Vol. 2&quot; (1964). The release of &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; created a bossa nova craze in the United States and subsequently internationally. Getz had previously recorded &quot;Jazz Samba&quot; with Charlie Byrd (1962), and &quot;Jazz Samba Encore!&quot; with Luiz Bonfá (1964). Jobim wrote many of the songs on &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot;, which became one of the best-selling jazz albums of all time, and turned Astrud Gilberto, who sang on &quot;Garota de Ipanema&quot; (&quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;) and &quot;Corcovado&quot; (&quot;Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars&quot;), into an international sensation. At the Grammy Awards of 1965 &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group and the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Among his later hits is &quot;Águas de Março&quot; (&quot;Waters of March&quot;, 1972), for which he wrote both the Portuguese and English lyrics, and which was then translated into French by Georges Moustaki (as &quot;Les Eaux de Mars&quot;, 1973).

In talking about his creative process when writing and creating &quot;Girl From Ipanema&quot;, Jobim told Roberto d’Ávila in 1981, &quot;It comes to me in a way, then it changes one or two times and all of the sudden, it becomes something that makes sense…it&#x27;s like the profile of a woman…the profile of a woman, something very discernible, then you say: ‘hey, this is really beautiful…’ then you stare and as soon as you stare, it&#x27;s gone, I mean it becomes part of the past.&quot; Jobim continues, &quot;I mean, every time you draw something it turns into, it&#x27;s something static… that portrait remains forever.&quot;

===Collaboration with Elis Regina c. 1974–1982===
Jobim and Elis Regina first met in 1974 in Los Angeles, when Regina was only 29 years old and still a fresh face in the Brazilian music industry. Regina was a force to be reckoned with, being referred to as &quot;furacão&quot; (&quot;hurricane&quot; in English) by those who worked with and around her. The two artists came together to create the album &quot;Elis &amp; Tom&quot; which would unexpectedly become tremendously popular in the United States as well as across the globe. Regina and Jobim had a special creative chemistry between them that was noted by those who were present to witness the collaborative process first hand during that era in both of their careers. Oscar Castro-Neves, a guitarist-producer who worked with Regina and Jobim on the &quot;Elis &amp; Tom&quot; album in the mid-1970s, recalled in an article with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;There was a very fine line between ‘rehearsal’ and ‘hanging out,’ ‘just talking’...it was all that seamless.&quot; Due to the nature of their work relationship, Regina and Jobim grew close and had a symbiosis that is reflected in the result of their work together. &quot;Aguas de Março&quot; represents this, with the lyrics simulating a banter of finishing each other&#x27;s sentences.

==Personal life==
Jobim was married to Thereza Otero Hermanny on 15 October 1949 and had two children with her: Paulo Jobim (1950–2022), an architect and musician, (father of Daniel Jobim (born 1973) and Dora Jobim (born 1976)); and Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Jobim (born 1957), a painter. Jobim and Thereza divorced in 1978. On 30 April 1986, he married 29-year-old photographer Ana Beatriz Lontra, with whom he had two more children: João Francisco Jobim (1979–1998) and Maria Luiza Helena Jobim (born 1987). Daniel, Paulo&#x27;s son, followed his grandfather to become a pianist and composer, and performed &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

==Death==
In early 1994, after finishing his album &quot;Antonio Brasileiro&quot;, Jobim complained to his doctor, Roberto Hugo Costa Lima, of urinary problems. He underwent an operation at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City on 2 December 1994. At 7:00 EST on 8 December, while recovering from surgery, he had a cardiac arrest caused by a pulmonary embolism, and two hours later, another cardiac arrest, from which he died. He was survived by his children and grandchildren. His last album, &quot;Antonio Brasileiro&quot;, was released posthumously, just days after his death.

His body lay in state until given a proper burial on 20 December 1994. He is buried in the Cemitério São João Batista in Rio de Janeiro.

==Legacy==
Jobim is widely regarded as one of the most important songwriters of the 20th century. Many of his songs are jazz standards. American jazz singers Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra prominently featured Jobim&#x27;s songs on their albums &quot;Ella Abraça Jobim&quot; (1981) and &quot;Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antônio Carlos Jobim&quot; (1967), respectively. The 1996 CD &quot;Wave: The Antonio Carlos Jobim Songbook&quot; included performances of Jobim tunes by Oscar Peterson, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Toots Thielemans.

Jobim was an innovator in the use of sophisticated harmonic structures in popular song. Some of his melodic twists, like the melody insisting on the major seventh of the chord, became commonplace in jazz after he used them.

The Brazilian collaborators and interpreters of Jobim&#x27;s music include Vinicius de Moraes, João Gilberto (often credited as a co-creator or creator of bossa nova), Chico Buarque, Edu Lobo, Gal Costa, Elis Regina, Sérgio Mendes, Astrud Gilberto and Flora Purim. Significant arrangements of Jobim&#x27;s compositions were written by Eumir Deodato, Nelson Riddle, and especially the conductor/composer Claus Ogerman.

He won a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012. As a posthumous homage, on 5 January 1999, the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro changed the name of Rio&#x27;s Galeão International Airport, located on Governador Island, to bear the composer&#x27;s name. Galeão Airport is explicitly mentioned in his composition &quot;Samba do Avião&quot;. In 2014, Jobim was posthumously inducted to the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; named Jobim as one of The 30 Most Influential Latin Artists of All Time.
He was nominated for five Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist at the 7th Grammy Awards, where he lost to the Beatles. He won Best Latin Jazz Performance for the album titled Antonio Brasileiro at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards.

Written by Elliott Smith, the ninth track on Oregon alternative rock band Heatmiser&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Cop and Speeder&quot; is entitled &quot;Antonio Carlos Jobim&quot;.

American contemporary jazz singer Michael Franks dedicated his 1995 album &quot;Abandoned Garden&quot; to the memory of Jobim. English singer/songwriter George Michael frequently acknowledged Jobim&#x27;s influence. His 1996 album &quot;Older&quot; was dedicated to Jobim, and he recorded &quot;Desafinado&quot; on &quot;Red Hot + Rio&quot; (1996) with Astrud Gilberto.

Following a public vote, the official mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Tom, was named after him.

In 2015, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in his honor by the IAU.

<text>Carpathian Forest is a Norwegian black metal band formed by Nattefrost and Nordavind in 1992. They are known for their unique style of black metal, often categorised as black &#x27;n&#x27; roll and includes a prominent, clanky bass tone and lyrics that revolve around BDSM, perversion, misanthropy, death and suicide.

== History ==
In late 1990, the band originally started under the name Enthrone by Nattefrost (then bearing the pseudonym Lord Nosferatu) and Nordavind (who used the pseudonym Lord Karnstein). Together they produced a self-released demo tape, &quot;Black Winds&quot;, in 1991.

In 1992, Enthrone changed its name to &quot;Carpathian Forest&quot;, and Lord Blackmangler and Damnatus joined their line-up. As a quartet they self-released three demo tapes: &quot;Rehearsal Outtake&quot;, &quot;Bloodlust and Perversion&quot; (both in 1992) and &quot;Journey Through the Cold Moors of Svarttjern&quot; (in 1993). However, Damnatus and Lord Blackmangler left afterwards, and Carpathian Forest became once more a duo.

Carpathian Forest would release their first studio work in 1995: the extended play &quot;Through Chasm, Caves and Titan Woods&quot;, via Avantgarde Music. It would be their first of many releases via Avantgarde.

In 1998 the band released their first full-length album, &quot;Black Shining Leather&quot;, once more via Avantgarde Music. It was their only release to feature Lazare (who would later join Borknagar) on the band&#x27;s line-up as a drummer. In the same year they also played their first concert at the Under the Black Sun Festival in Schönermark, Germany.

Lazare left Carpathian Forest in 1999, the same year Anders Kobro, Tchort and Daniel Vrangsinn joined them as permanent members. In the following year, their second full-length, &quot;Strange Old Brew&quot;, was released. It was their most experimental album so far. By the end of the year they also released a single, &quot;He&#x27;s Turning Blue&quot;.

In 2001, founding member Nordavind left Carpathian Forest, during the recording sessions of their third studio album, &quot;Morbid Fascination of Death&quot;, that still retained the experimentation (although to a lesser extent) of their previous release, &quot;Strange Old Brew&quot;. In the following year the compilation album &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Hell for This: Over a Decade of Perversions&quot; was released, in order to celebrate the band&#x27;s 10th anniversary as Carpathian Forest. It was their last album to be released by Avantgarde Music before they switched on to Season of Mist.

Their fourth full-length, &quot;Defending the Throne of Evil&quot;, was released in 2003 by Season of Mist. Contrasting with Carpathian Forest&#x27;s previous releases, it was their most melodic album so far, almost reminiscent of symphonic black metal. In late 2003 the band was joined by Gøran &quot;Blood Pervertor&quot; Bomann.

2004 saw the release of a live DVD, &quot;We&#x27;re Going to Hollywood for This&quot;, and a compilation album featuring rarities and reworked versions of old Carpathian Forest songs, (Norwegian for &quot;Desecrate His Body&quot;).

Carpathian Forest&#x27;s latest studio album was the 2006 release &quot;Fuck You All!!!! Caput tuum in ano est&quot;, that was a throwback to their early, blackened thrash metal-like sonority of their debut.

In an early 2008 issue of &quot;Terrorizer&quot;, Tchort spoke about the possibility of a new album, and the rumors circulating regarding a &quot;half-finished album&quot;. He is quoted as saying: &quot;I met with Nattefrost a few weeks ago and we decided to focus on a new album, but we haven&#x27;t even started writing it yet. The news that we had an album half-finished was based on the fact that we had material left over from the last album. Since we record in different studios, this meant that I had the basics for music that Nattefrost never heard&quot;. He also divulged that &quot;[we] kind of decided on a slightly new direction for the band, compared to &quot;Fuck You All&quot;, at least&quot;.

The band co-headlined the Inferno Festival in 2009, and confirmed rumors that a new album was in the works.

The band entered on a relative hiatus after 2009, but from 2012 onwards they began to play on some festivals around Europe. The band was scheduled to play on the Maryland Deathfest on 26 May 2013, but their show had to be cancelled due to last-minute visa problems. The band&#x27;s last-known concert was at Incineration Fest, in London England in May 2019.

In the band&#x27;s concerts in 2013–2014, Jonathan Perez from Green Carnation (and former Sirenia and Trail Of Tears) stepped in as their live drummer.

The band went on hiatus in July 2014, after Tchort and Blood Pervertor announced they had parted ways with Carpathian Forest, and would form a new band called The 3rd Attempt.

In 2017, the band returned, and announced that they were working on a new album which would be called &quot;Likskue&quot;, to be released in 2018.

<text>The Game Critics Awards were a set of annual awards held after the E3 video game conference since 1998. The awards were given to products displayed at E3 with the title Best of E3 of their category. The 21st Annual Game Critics Awards was showcased for the final time in 2019, four years before E3 was permanently discontinued.

==Format==
The nominees and winners of the awards were chosen by individual judges representing 35 (as of 2011) major North American media outlets. The awards were given independently of the Expo&#x27;s organizers.

==Current categories==
Note on &quot;all systems&quot; as platform: Because games shown at E3 may still be in development, the platforms for which the game is published might differ.

<doc id="297428" wikidata="Q1076134" url="?curid=297428" title="Andernach chess">
<text>Andernach chess is a chess variant in which a piece making a capture (except kings) changes colour. For instance, if a white bishop on a2 were to capture a black knight on g8, the result would be a black bishop on g8. Non-capturing moves are played as in orthodox chess. If a pawn captures on eighth rank, it is promoted first and then changes colour.

The game was named after the German town of Andernach, which is the site of annual meetings of fairy chess enthusiasts. It was during the 1993 meeting there that Andernach chess was introduced with a chess problem composing tournament for Andernach problems. It has since become a popular variant in problem composition, though it has not yet become popular as a game-playing variant.
==Example problem==

An example Andernach chess problem is shown in the diagram. The task is to find a proof game, which would last three moves and lead to the position shown. The solution is: 
:1. Nf3 Nc6 2. Ne5 Nxe5(=wN) 
The black knight turns into a white knight after capture on e5. White can now move this knight.

:3. Nxd7(=bN) 
This time a white knight turns into a black knight.

:3... Nb8 (see diagram)

==Variations==
Predecessor of Andernach chess was Tibetan chess, in which the black units (called &quot;lamas&quot;) change colour and piece type when capturing white pieces of a different type. As in Andernach chess, the king is not affected by capture. For example, if a black pawn on d7 captures a white queen on c6, it becomes a white queen and can be moved by White on the next move. This game is not related to Chandraki, a chess variant that may have been played in Tibet.

A variant on Andernach chess is anti-Andernach, in which pieces except kings change colour after non-captures, but stay the same colour after a capture. There is also super-Andernach in which all pieces except kings change colour after every move, whether a capture or not. Super-Andernach was introduced by John Rice in &quot;The Problemist Supplement&quot; in March 2006.

<doc id="297431" wikidata="Q1754611" url="?curid=297431" title="Seven Days in May">
<text>Seven Days in May is a 1964 American political thriller film about a military-political cabal&#x27;s planned takeover of the United States government in reaction to the president&#x27;s negotiation of a disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. The film, starring Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Fredric March, and Ava Gardner, was directed by John Frankenheimer from a screenplay written by Rod Serling and based on the novel of the same name by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II, published in September 1962.

==Plot==
During the Cold War, the unpopular U.S. President Jordan Lyman has signed a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union, and ratification by the Senate produced a wave of dissatisfaction, especially among Lyman&#x27;s political opposition and the military, who believe the Russians cannot be trusted. His popularity reaches an all-time low of 29%, and rioting about the treaty occurs right outside the White House. The presidential physician warns him of a dangerous cardiac condition which he blithely disregards, too busy to take a prescribed two-week vacation.

United States Marine Corps Colonel &quot;Jiggs&quot; Casey is the Director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He serves its chairman, four-star United States Air Force general James Mattoon Scott, a highly-decorated commander and air ace.

Casey stumbles upon evidence that Scott is leading the Joint Chiefs to stage a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; to remove Lyman in seven days. Under the plan, disguised as a training exercise, a secret army unit known as ECOMCON, training at a secret Texas base, will take control of the country&#x27;s telephone, radio, and television networks while the president, participating in a staged &quot;alert,&quot; is seized. Scott, who is busy advancing his charismatic public persona through nationally televised anti-treaty rallies, plans to head a military junta. Although personally opposed to Lyman&#x27;s policies, Casey is appalled by the plot and alerts Lyman.

Still somewhat skeptical, Lyman gathers a circle of trusted advisors to investigate: Secret Service White House detail chief Art Corwin, Treasury Secretary Christopher Todd, longtime advisor Paul Girard, and Raymond Clark, the senior U.S. senator from Georgia and a close friend of 21 years.

Casey has deduced that the heads of all U.S. military branches but the Navy support Scott&#x27;s coup scheme, with Vice Admiral Barnswell, then aboard an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, apparently the only invited officer to decline. Lyman cancels a previous commitment to participate in Scott&#x27;s alert, pretending he will be away for a fishing weekend. He then dispatches Girard to Gibraltar to obtain Barnswell&#x27;s confession, sends the alcoholic Clark to Texas to locate the secret base, and tasks Casey to gather dirt on the general&#x27;s private life. Meanwhile, the Secret Service surreptitiously films evidence of an attempt to kidnap the president during the phony fishing trip, removing all doubts about the existence of a plot.

Girard successfully secures Barnswell&#x27;s confession in writing, but this is lost with him when a plane crash in Spain claims his life. Clark is taken captive when he reaches the secret base and held incommunicado. Exploiting Casey&#x27;s longtime friendship with the base&#x27;s deputy commander Colonel Henderson, Clark convinces Henderson of the actual intent of the impending &quot;alert&quot;. Henderson frees Clark and leads an escape back to Washington but is abducted and confined in a military stockade. In a radiophone conference call with the president, Barnswell denies knowledge of any conspiracy.

Knowing he cannot prove Scott&#x27;s guilt, Lyman nevertheless calls Scott to the White House to demand that he and the other conspirators resign. Scott refuses and denies the existence of any plot. Lyman argues that a coup would prompt the Soviets to launch a preemptive nuclear strike. Scott maintains that the American people are behind him. Lyman challenges him to resign and run for office in order to seek power legitimately, but Scott is unmoved. Lyman restrains himself from confronting Scott with damning letters that Casey had obtained from Scott&#x27;s former mistress Eleanor Holbrook. Casey, who has his own romantic interest in Holbrook, eventually returns them to her.

Scott meets the other three Joint Chiefs and reasserts his intention to execute the coup. He plans a nighttime network broadcast, but Lyman holds an afternoon press conference to announce he has fired the four men. As he speaks, Barnswell&#x27;s confession, recovered from the plane crash, is handed to him and he delays the conference. In the interim, copies of the confession are delivered to Scott and the other plotters. As the conference resumes, Scott abandons the plan and, devastated, returns home when Lyman announces that the other three conspirators have resigned.

Lyman delivers a speech on the state of the nation and its values, declaring that the nation gains strength through peace rather than by conflict. The press corps applauds.

==Background==
The book was written in late 1961 and into early 1962 during the first year of the Kennedy administration, reflecting some of the events of that era. In November 1961, President John F. Kennedy accepted the resignation of vociferously anti-communist general Edwin Walker, who had been indoctrinating the troops under his command with radical right-wing ideas and personal political opinions, including describing Harry S. Truman, Dean Acheson, Eleanor Roosevelt, and other active public figures as communist sympathizers. Although no longer in uniform, Walker continued to make headlines as he ran for governor of Texas and made speeches promoting strongly right-wing views. In the film version of &quot;Seven Days in May&quot;, Fredric March, portraying the narrative&#x27;s fictional president Jordan Lyman, mentions General Walker as one of the &quot;false prophets&quot; who were offering themselves to the public as leaders.

As Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II, primarily political journalists and columnists, collaborated on the novel, they also conducted interviews with another highly controversial military commander, the newly appointed Air Force chief of staff General Curtis LeMay, who was angry with Kennedy for refusing to provide air support for the Cuban rebels in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. The character of General James Mattoon Scott was believed to have been inspired by both LeMay and Walker.

President Kennedy had read the novel &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; shortly after its publication and believed that the scenario could actually occur in the United States. According to director John Frankenheimer, the project received encouragement and assistance from Kennedy through White House press secretary Pierre Salinger, who conveyed to Frankenheimer Kennedy&#x27;s wish that the film be produced. In spite of Defense Department opposition, Kennedy arranged to visit the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port for a weekend when the film needed to shoot outside the White House.

==Production==
Kirk Douglas and director John Frankenheimer were the moving forces behind the filming of &quot;Seven Days in May&quot;; the film was produced by Edward Lewis through Douglas&#x27;s company Joel Productions and Seven Arts Productions. Frankenheimer recruited screenwriter Rod Serling. Douglas intended to star in the film along with his frequent costar Burt Lancaster. Douglas offered Lancaster the General Scott role, while Douglas agreed to play Scott&#x27;s assistant. Frankenheimer commissioned Nedrick Young to rewrite the scene in which Casey visits Holbrook at her apartment.

Lancaster&#x27;s involvement nearly caused Frankenheimer to withdraw from the project, as the two men had conflicted during the production of &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; two years earlier. Only Douglas&#x27;s assurances that Lancaster would behave kept Frankenheimer on the project. Lancaster and Frankenheimer were at peace during the filming, but Douglas and Frankenheimer sparred with one another. Frankenheimer was very happy with Lancaster&#x27;s performance, especially the long scene toward the end between Lancaster and March, saying that Lancaster was &quot;perfect&quot; in his delivery. Frankenheimer stated decades later that he considered &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; among his most satisfying work. He saw the film as putting &quot;a nail in the coffin of McCarthy.&quot;

The filming took 51 days and according to the director the production was a happy affair, with all of the actors and crew displaying great reverence for Fredric March. As supporting actor Richard Anderson recalled of March: &quot;He was wonderful. As a kid, I watched him in those Fox movie houses in the thirties. I grew up on him. I told him, &#x27;It&#x27;s such a pleasure to meet you.&#x27; He said, &#x27;Thank you, Mr. Anderson.&#x27; One day, I watched him work. Right after filming, he turned to the wardrobe man and said, &#x27;Bill, don&#x27;t take the coat and fix it up for tomorrow. Leave it like it is. We&#x27;re continuing the scene.&#x27; He wanted the coat to look the same way. How&#x27;d you like that for an actor?&quot;

Many of Lancaster&#x27;s scenes were shot at a later time as he was recovering from hepatitis. Ava Gardner, whose scenes were shot in just six days, thought that Frankenheimer favored the other actors over her. Frankenheimer remarked that she was sometimes &quot;difficult.&quot; Martin Balsam objected to Frankenheimer&#x27;s habit of shooting pistols behind him during important scenes. Frankenheimer had been briefly stationed in the mailroom at the Pentagon early in his Korean war service and stated that the sets were totally authentic, praising the production designer. Further providing authenticity, many of the scenes in the film were loosely based on real-life events of the Cold War.
 In an early example of guerrilla filmmaking, Frankenheimer photographed Balsam ferrying to the supercarrier in San Diego without prior permission. Another example occurred when Frankenheimer wanted a shot of Douglas entering the Pentagon, but unable to receive permission, he rigged a camera in a parked car.

Frankenheimer recruited well-known producer and friend John Houseman to play Vice Admiral Farley C. Barnswell in his uncredited acting debut. Houseman agreed in return for a fine bottle of wine (seen during the telephone scene). Several scenes, including one with standins for nuns, were shot inside the recently built Washington Dulles International Airport, and the production team was the first to ever film there. The alley and car-park scene was shot in Hollywood, and other footage was shot in the Californian desert in 110-degree heat. The secret base and airstrip were specially built in the desert near Indio, California, and an aircraft tail was used in one shot to create the illusion of a whole plane off screen. The original script had Lancaster dying in a car crash at the end after hitting a bus, but this was dropped in favor of a scene showing him leaving for home in his limousine, a scene that was shot in Paris during production of &quot;The Train&quot; (1964).

Presidential press secretary Pierre Salinger conveyed to Frankenheimer that President Kennedy had read the book and hoped that the film would be produced. Kennedy arranged a visit to the family compound in Hyannis Port one weekend so that the riot scene could be filmed outside the White House.

Frankenheimer considered the scene in which Douglas&#x27;s character visits the president to be a masterful bit of acting which would have been very difficult for most actors to sustain. He had done similar scenes on many television shows, and not only the acting but also every camera angle and shot were extensively planned and rehearsed. Frankenheimer paid particular attention to ensuring that all three actors in the scene were in focus for dramatic impact. Many of Frankenheimer&#x27;s signature techniques were used in scenes such as this throughout the film, including his &quot;depth of focus&quot; shot with one or two people near the camera and another or others in the distance and the &quot;low angle, wide-angle lens&quot; (set at f/11) which he considered to give &quot;tremendous impact&quot; on a scene.

The film is set several years in the future from the time of its release. Although &quot;1970&quot; appears on a Pentagon display and the registration sticker on the rear license plate of Senator Prentice&#x27;s Bentley sedan, the day/date indicator in the Pentagon depicts TUES / MAY 13, a date occurring only in such post-1964 years as 1969, 1975, 1980 or 1986. Other nods include a situation room which was designed to seem futuristic, as well as the utilization of then-futuristic technology of video teleconferencing and the recently issued and exotic-looking M16 rifle. Additionally, the concept of a nuclear treaty between Cold War powers anticipated the actual existence of one.

==Soundtrack==
David Amram, who had previously scored Frankenheimer&#x27;s &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962), originally provided music for the film, but Lewis was unsatisfied with his work. Jerry Goldsmith, who had worked with the producer and Douglas on &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot; (also 1962) and &quot;The List of Adrian Messenger&quot; (1963), was signed to rescore the project.

Goldsmith composed a very brief score (lasting around 15 minutes) using only pianos and percussion; he later scored &quot;Seconds&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Challenge&quot; (1982) for Frankenheimer.

In 2013, Intrada Records released Goldsmith&#x27;s music for the film on a limited-edition CD -- paired with Maurice Jarre&#x27;s score for &quot;The Mackintosh Man&quot;, although that film was produced by Warner Bros. while &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; was theatrically released by Paramount. The entire Seven Arts Productions library had been acquired by Warner Bros. back in 1967.

==Reception==
&quot;Seven Days in May&quot; premiered on February 12, 1964 in Washington, D.C., to good critical notices and audience response.

===Awards and nominations===
The film was nominated for two 1965 Academy Awards, for Edmond O&#x27;Brien for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration/Black-and-White for Cary Odell and Edward G. Boyle. In that year&#x27;s Golden Globe Awards, O&#x27;Brien won for Best Supporting Actor, and Fredric March, John Frankenheimer, and composer Jerry Goldsmith received nominations.

Frankenheimer won a Danish Bodil Award for directing the Best Non-European Film, and Rod Serling was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Drama.

===Evaluation in film guides===
&quot;Steven H. Scheuer&#x27;s Movies on TV&quot; (1972–73 edition) gives &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; its highest rating of four stars, recommending it as &quot;an exciting suspense drama concerned with politics and the problems of sanity and survival in a nuclear age&quot;, with the concluding sentences stating, &quot;benefits from taut screenplay by Rod Serling and the direction of John Frankenheimer, which artfully builds interest leading to the finale. March is a standout in a uniformly fine cast. So many American-made films dealing with political subjects are so naive and simple-minded that the thoughtful and, in this case, the optimistic statement of the film is a welcome surprise.&quot; By the 1986–87 edition, Scheuer&#x27;s rating was lowered to 3½ and the conclusion shortened to, &quot;which artfully builds to the finale&quot;, with the final sentences deleted. &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s TV Movies &amp; Video Guide&quot; (1989 edition) gives it a still lower 3 stars (out of 4), originally describing it as an &quot;absorbing story of military scheme to overthrow the government&quot;, with later editions (including 2014) adding one word, &quot;absorbing, &quot;believable&quot; story...&quot;

&quot;Videohound&#x27;s Golden Movie Retriever&quot; follows Scheuer&#x27;s later example, with 3½ bones (out of 4), calling it a &quot;topical but still gripping Cold War nuclear-peril thriller&quot; and, in the end, &quot;highly suspenseful, with a breathtaking climax.&quot; &quot;Mick Martin&#x27;s &amp; Marsha Porter&#x27;s DVD &amp; Video Guide&quot; also puts its rating high, at 4 stars (out of 5) finding it, as &quot;Videohound&quot; did, &quot;a highly suspenseful account of an attempted military takeover...&quot; and indicating that &quot;the movie&#x27;s tension snowballs toward a thrilling conclusion. This is one of those rare films that treat their audiences with respect.&quot; Assigning the equally high rating of 4 stars (out of 5), &quot;The Motion Picture Guide&quot; begins its description with &quot;a taut, gripping, and suspenseful political thriller which sports superb performances from the entire cast&quot;, goes to state, in the middle, that &quot;proceeding to unravel its complicated plot at a rapid clip, &quot;SEVEN DAYS IN MAY&quot; is a surprisingly exciting film that also packs a grim warning&quot;, and ends with &quot;Lancaster underplays the part of the slightly crazed general and makes him seem quite rational and persuasive. It is a frightening performance. Douglas is also quite good as the loyal aide who uncovers the fantastic plot that could destroy the entire country. March, Balsam, O&#x27;Brien, Bissell, and Houseman all turn in topnotch performances and it is through their conviction that the viewer becomes engrossed in this outlandish tale.&quot;

British references also show high regard for the film, with &quot;TimeOut Film Guide&quot;″s founding editor Tom Milne indicating that &quot;conspiracy movies may have become more darkly complex in these post-Watergate days of Pakula and paranoia, but Frankenheimer&#x27;s fascination with gadgetry (in his compositions, the ubiquitous helicopters, TV screens, hidden cameras and electronic devices literally edge the human characters into insignificance) is used to create a striking visual metaphor for control by the military machine. Highly enjoyable.&quot; In his &quot;Film Guide&quot;, Leslie Halliwell provided 3 stars (out of 4), describing it as an &quot;absorbing political mystery drama marred only by the unnecessary introduction of a female character. Stimulating entertainment.&quot; David Shipman in his 1984 &quot;The Good Film and Video Guide&quot; gives 2 (out of 4) stars, noting that it is &quot;a tense political thriller whose plot is plotting&quot;.

==Remake==
The film was remade in 1994 by HBO as &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; with Sam Waterston as President William Foster, Jason Robards as General R. Pendleton Lloyd, and Forest Whitaker as Colonel MacKenzie &quot;Mac&quot; Casey. This version followed many parts of the original plot closely, while updating it for the post–Cold War world, omitting certain incidents and changing the ending.

<text>Hard-edge painting (also referred to as Hard Edge or Hard-edged) is painting in which abrupt transitions are found between color areas. Color areas often consist of one unvarying color. The Hard-edge painting style is related to Geometric abstraction, Op Art, Post-painterly Abstraction, and Color Field painting.

==History of the term==
The term “Hard-edge painting” was coined in 1959 by writer, curator, and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; art critic Jules Langsner, along with Peter Selz, to describe the work of several painters from California who adopted a knowingly impersonal paint application and delineated areas of color with particular sharpness and clarity. This style was a significant reaction to the more painterly or gestural forms of Abstract expressionism, one of the United States’ primary painting movements at the time. The “hard-edge” approach to abstract painting became widespread in the 1960s, though California was its creative center.

Other earlier art movements have also contained the quality of hard-edgedness; for example, the Precisionists also displayed this quality to a great degree in their work. Hard-edge can be seen to be associated with one or more school of painting, but is also a generally descriptive term, for these qualities found in any painting. Hard-edge painting can be figurative or nonrepresentational.

=== &quot;Four Abstract Classicists&quot; Exhibition ===
In the late 1950s, Langsner and Peter Selz, then professor at Pomona College, observed a common link among the recent work of Lorser Feitelson (1898–1978), Feitelson&#x27;s wife Helen Lundeberg (1908–1999), John McLaughlin (1898–1976), Frederick Hammersley (1919–2009), and Karl Benjamin (1925-2012). This group of seven gathered at the Feitelson&#x27;s home to discuss a group exhibition of this nonfigurative painting style. Curated by Langsner, &quot;Four Abstract Classicists&quot; opened at the San Francisco Museum of Art in 1959, then traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Exposition Park. Helen Lundeberg was not included in the exhibit. 

&quot;Four Abstract Classicists&quot; was renamed &quot;West Coast Hard-edge&quot; by British art critic and curator Lawrence Alloway when it traveled to the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, where Alloway was assistant director, and Queen&#x27;s University in Belfast. The term came into broader use after Alloway used it to describe contemporary American geometric abstract painting featuring &quot;economy of form,&quot; &quot;fullness of color,&quot; &quot;neatness of surface,&quot; and the nonrelational arrangement of forms on the canvas.

=== &quot;California Hard-Edge Painting&quot; Exhibition ===
In 1964, a second major hard-edge exhibition curated by Jules Langsner, simply titled &quot;California Hard-Edge Painting,&quot; was held at the Pavilion Gallery in Balboa, CA (also known as the Newport Pavilion) with the cooperation of the Ankrum Gallery, Esther Robles Gallery, Felix Landau Gallery, Ferus Gallery, and Heritage Gallery of Los Angeles. Along with Feitselon, Lundeberg, McLaughlin, Hammersley, and Benjamin, &quot;California Hard-Edge Painting&quot; included Florence Arnold, John Barbour, Larry Bell, John Coplans, June Harwood, and Dorothy Waldman.

== Legacy ==
In 2000, Tobey C. Moss curated &quot;Four Abstract Classicists Plus One&quot; at her gallery in Los Angeles. The exhibit again featured John McLaughlin, Feitelson, Hammersley, and Benjamin, and added Lundeberg as the fifth of the original Hard-edge painters. In 2003, Louis Stern Fine Arts presented a retrospective exhibition for Lorser Feitelson entitled &quot;Lorser Feitelson and the invention of Hard-edge painting, 1945–1965.&quot; The same year, NOHO MODERN showed the works of June Harwood in an exhibition entitled &quot;June Harwood: Hard-edge painting Revisited, 1959–1969.&quot; Art critic Dave Hickey solidified the place of these 6 artists in &quot;The Los Angeles School: Karl Benjamin, Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley, June Harwood, Helen Lundeberg, and John McLaughlin&quot;, an exhibition held at the Ben Maltz Gallery of the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles in 2004-2005. In 2007-2008, the Orange County Museum of Art exhibited &quot;Birth of the Cool: California Art, Design, and Culture at Midcentury&quot;, which included the original &quot;four abstract classicists&quot; along with midcentury design, music and film. &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; traveled nationwide to the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, MA; the Oakland Museum of California, Oakland, CA; the Mildred Kemper Lane Art Museum, St. Louis, MO; and the Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art, Austin, TX.

In 2011, the style was featured prominently at the Getty Museum’s initial iteration of &quot;Pacific Standard Time&quot;, titled &quot;Crosscurrents in L.A. Painting and Sculpture, 1950-1970&quot; , which showcased the artistic practices that characterized the postwar L.A. art scene. The exhibition highlighted selections from Louis Stern Fine Arts including Karl Benjamin’s &quot;Stage II&quot; (1958) and Helen Lundeberg’s &quot;Blue Planet&quot; (1965).

Louis Stern Fine Arts continues to exhibit and represent the estates of Hard-Edge painters, including Benjamin, Lundeberg, and Feitelson.

<text>An easel is an upright support used for displaying and/or fixing something resting upon it, at an angle of about 20° to the vertical. In particular, painters traditionally use an easel to support a painting while they work on it, normally standing up; easels are also sometimes used to display finished paintings. Artists&#x27; easels are still typically made of wood, in functional designs that have changed little for centuries, or even millennia,
though new materials and designs exist. Easels are typically made from wood, aluminum or steel.

Easel painting is a term in art history for the type of midsize painting that would have been painted on an easel, as opposed to a fresco wall painting, a large altarpiece or other piece that would have been painted resting on a floor, a small cabinet painting, or a miniature created while sitting at a desk, though perhaps also on an angled support. It does not refer to the way the painting is meant to be displayed; most easel paintings are intended for display framed and hanging on a wall.

In a photographic darkroom, an easel is used to keep the photographic paper in a flat or upright (horizontal, big-size enlarging) position to the enlarger.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;easel&quot; is an old Germanic synonym for donkey (compare similar semantics). In various other languages, its equivalent is the only word for both the animal and the apparatus, such as and earlier (the easel generally in full , &quot;painter&#x27;s donkey&quot;), themselves cognates of the (ass).

==History==
Easels have been in use since the time of the ancient Egyptians. In the 1st century, Pliny the Elder made reference to a &quot;large panel&quot; placed upon an easel.

==Design==
There are three common designs for easels:
* A Frame designs are based on three legs. Variations include: crossbars to make the easel more stable; and an independent mechanism to allow for the vertical adjustment of the working plane without sacrificing the stability of the legs of the easel.
* H-Frame designs are based on right angles. All posts are generally parallel to each other with the base of the easel being rectangular. The main, front portion of the easel consists of two vertical posts with a horizontal crossbar support, giving the design the general shape of an &#x27;H&#x27;. A variation uses additions that allow the easel&#x27;s angle with respect to the ground to be adjusted.
*Multiple purpose designs incorporate improved tripod and H-frame features with extra multiple adjustment capabilities that include finite rotational, horizontal and vertical adjustment of the working plane.

==Differences==

An easel can be full height, designed for standing by itself on the floor. Shorter easels can be designed for use on a table.
* Artists&#x27; easels typically are fully adjustable to accommodate for different angles. Most have built-in anti-skid plates on the feet to prevent sliding. They are collapsible and overall very slim in stature to fit in small spaces around the studio. The simplest form of an artist&#x27;s easel, a tripod, consists of three vertical posts joined at one end. A pivoting mechanism allows the centre-most post to pivot away from the other two, while the two non-pivoting posts have a horizontal cross member where the canvas is placed. A similar model can hold a blackboard, projection surface, placard, etc.
*Pochade boxes are a type of artists&#x27; easel that is mounted on top of a camera tripod. They include both a support for the painting, as well as a palette. They may or may not include a box for supplies. 
* Paint stations are meant as more stationary consoles. These are usually equipped with various holsters, slots and supporting platforms to accommodate for buckets, brushes and canvas styles. Most of the components can be broken down for easy cleaning and storage.
* Children&#x27;s easels are intended to be more durable. They are typically shorter than standard easels and usually come equipped with dry erase boards and/or chalkboards attached.
* Display easels are for display purposes and are meant to enhance the presentation of a painting.
* Facilitation easels are for capturing audience or participant input and are meant to involve the participants with the content.
* Darkroom easels keep photographic paper in a flat or upright (horizontal, big-size enlarging) position to the enlarger.

==Use==
It is most often used to hold up a painter&#x27;s canvas or large sketchbook while the artist is working, or to hold a completed painting for exhibition.

Here are some common uses for easels:
* Studio easels are meant for use in the artist&#x27;s studio with limited need for the easel to be portable. Studio easels may be simple in design or very complex, including winches, multiple masts and casters. The largest easels are studio easels, with some being able to support panels weighing over 200 pounds and measuring over 7 feet in height. 

* Field easels or plein air easels are meant to be portable for the creation of &quot;en plein air&quot; work. These easels are usually midsize or small, have telescopic or collapsible legs and are based on the tripod design. &quot;French box easels&quot; include a compartment in which to store art supplies conveniently along with a handle or straps so that the French box may be carried like a briefcase or a backpack.
* Display easels are meant for the display of finished artworks. These easels tend to be very simple in design with less concern for the stability needed by a working artist. Display easels vary in size and sturdiness depending upon the weight and size of the object to be placed on them.
* Facilitation easels hold large pads of paper and have trays for holding markers of varying colors
* Mini easels are similar in design to display easels but scaled down to accommodate photos or flyers
* Darkroom easels hold photographic paper perfectly flat during exposure. Some of these easels are designed with adjustable, overlapping, flat steel &quot;blades&quot; to crop the image on the paper to the desired size while keeping an unexposed white border around the image.

<text>Norske Skog ASA, formerly Norske Skogindustrier ASA, which translates as &quot;Norwegian Forest Industries&quot;, is a Norwegian pulp and paper company established in 1962. The company has long been one of the world&#x27;s leading manufacturers of newsprint and magazine paper. Due to a declining market for publication paper, the company has increasingly focused on other uses of timber and recycled paper, such as packaging. The company is headquartered in Norway and has factories in five countries and an annual production of approximately 2 million tonnes of paper (2020).

==History==
Norske Skog started in 1962 with the construction of a paper mill at Skogn in Norway, with the plant opening in 1966 and a second paper machine added in 1967. Half the capital for the project was issued by the Norwegian Forest Owners Association. In 1972 Norske Skog started a cooperation with Follum Fabrikker in Hønefoss. By 1989 Norske Skog had acquired Follum Fabrikker and Union in Skien as well as Saugbrugsforeningen in Halden. With this Norske Skog controlled all the pulp and paper mills in Norway.

The first international acquisition came in 1992 with Norske Skog Golbey in Lorraine, France. The company later bought the entire plant in 1995. Norske Skog expanded with purchases in Austria in 1996 and the Czech Republic in 1997. In 1998 it purchased mills in Thailand and the Republic of Korea.

In 2000 Norske Skog bought the British Columbia-based Fletcher Challenge Canada with nine mills and Pacifica Papers (formerly MacMillan Bloedel) and created NorskeCanada. At the same time it absorbed the Australian Newsprint Mills, a subsidiary of Fletcher Challenge. By 2006 Norske Skog had sold its shares in NorskeCanada and the company changed its name to Catalyst Paper.

In September 2005 it acquired the Asian company PanAsia Paper, in turn making Norske Skog Asia&#x27;s largest producer of newsprint and magazine paper.

During the following years, the company suffered from an oversupply in the paper industry and mounting debt. A number of factories were closed, downsized or divested. The closure of the Union paper mill in Skien in 2005 caused a massive outcry, including protests from a number of politicians. Further closures include the closure of a factory in Steti in the Czech Republic, the indefinite closure of a factory in South Korea, and the closure of one of the three paper machines at Follum. From March 2007 to March 2008, the stock value plummeted from over to below . An editorial in the Norwegian business newspaper Finansavisen could not rule out the possibility of bankruptcy. In September 2008, Norske Skog Korea was bought by Morgan Stanley Private Equity of Asia and Shinhan Private Equity.

Sven Ombudstvedt became CEO of Norske Skog in January 2010. Ombudstvedt was previously chief financial officer and a management board member of Yara International and strategy director of Norsk Hydro. Ombudstvedt succeeded Christian Rynning-Tønnesen.

Norske Skogindustrier ASA went bankrupt in 2017 and was delisted from the Oslo Stock Exchange. However, the operations continued, and was reorganized under a new parent company, Norske Skog ASA, which was reintroduced to the Oslo Stock Exchange in October 2019.

Over the following years, the group has diversified in order to counter the downward trend of the publication paper market. In 2020, it was announced that two paper machines, at Bruck an der Mur in Austria and Golbey in France, would be converted to produce recycled containerboard. The company is also pursuing fibre-based growth initiatives under the brand names Cebina and Cebico as well as energy related projects such as biogas. Norske Skog is also the major shareholder of Circa Group, which is listed separately on Euronext Growth with the ticker CIRCA.

===Environmental record===

Norske Skog have been accused of environmental destruction in New Zealand. One of their plants has consumed an entire inland fresh water lake, once full of marine life and a healthy eco system and replaced it with a large stagnant pit full of dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). Drums of zinc hydrosulphite and sodium dichromate are buried in the lake bed. Testing has also detected manganese, ammoniacal nitrogen, boron, arsenic, zinc, and chloride, these exceed the maximum concentration limits for drinking water, further polluting the ground water and feeding in to other areas. 

Norske Skog have effectively walked away from the responsibility to clean up the work site, by closing the paper mill plant, they are refusing to engage with local indigenous Maori, guardians of the environment.

Norske Skog continue to ignore requests and written plans, to remediate the land. Norske Skog hide behind out dated and old legislation that gave them the legal means to pollute on such a huge scale. Around 600,000m3 of toxic sludge was dumped into Lake Rotoitipaku over 30 years. Norske Skog operates on 3.54 Billion of revenue as of September 2022

<text>In functional analysis, a discipline within mathematics, given a formula_1-algebra formula_2, the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction establishes a correspondence between cyclic formula_3-representations of formula_2 and certain linear functionals on formula_2 (called &quot;states&quot;). The correspondence is shown by an explicit construction of the formula_3-representation from the state. It is named for Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark, and Irving Segal.

== States and representations ==

A formula_3-representation of a formula_1-algebra formula_2 on a Hilbert space formula_10 is a mapping
formula_11 from formula_2 into the algebra of bounded operators on formula_10 such that
* formula_11 is a ring homomorphism which carries involution on formula_2 into involution on operators
* formula_11 is nondegenerate, that is the space of vectors formula_17 formula_18 is dense as formula_19 ranges through formula_2 and formula_18 ranges through formula_10. Note that if formula_2 has an identity, nondegeneracy means exactly formula_11 is unit-preserving, i.e. formula_11 maps the identity of formula_2 to the identity operator on formula_10.

A state on a formula_1-algebra formula_2 is a positive linear functional formula_30 of norm formula_31. If formula_2 has a multiplicative unit element this condition is equivalent to formula_33.

For a representation formula_11 of a formula_1-algebra formula_2 on a Hilbert space formula_10, an element formula_18 is called a cyclic vector if the set of vectors
:formula_39
is norm dense in formula_10, in which case π is called a cyclic representation. Any non-zero vector of an irreducible representation is cyclic. However, non-zero vectors in a general cyclic representation may fail to be cyclic.

===The GNS construction===
Let formula_11 be a formula_3-representation of a formula_1-algebra formula_2 on the Hilbert space formula_10 and formula_18 be a unit norm cyclic vector for formula_11. Then
formula_48
is a state of formula_2.

Conversely, every state of formula_2 may be viewed as a vector state as above, under a suitable canonical representation.


The method used to produce a formula_3-representation from a state of formula_2 in the proof of the above theorem is called the GNS construction.
For a state of a formula_1-algebra formula_2, the corresponding GNS representation is essentially uniquely determined by the condition, formula_55 as seen in the theorem below.
===Significance of the GNS construction===
The GNS construction is at the heart of the proof of the Gelfand–Naimark theorem characterizing formula_1-algebras as algebras of operators. A formula_1-algebra has sufficiently many pure states (see below) so that the direct sum of corresponding irreducible GNS representations is faithful.

The direct sum of the corresponding GNS representations of all states is called the universal representation of formula_2. The universal representation of formula_2 contains every cyclic representation. As every formula_3-representation is a direct sum of cyclic representations, it follows that every formula_3-representation of formula_2 is a direct summand of some sum of copies of the universal representation.

If formula_63 is the universal representation of a formula_1-algebra formula_2, the closure of formula_66 in the weak operator topology is called the enveloping von Neumann algebra of formula_2. It can be identified with the double dual formula_68.

== Irreducibility ==

Also of significance is the relation between irreducible formula_3-representations and extreme points of the convex set of states. A representation π on formula_10 is irreducible if and only if there are no closed subspaces of formula_10 which are invariant under all the operators formula_72 other than formula_10 itself and the trivial subspace formula_74.

Both of these results follow immediately from the Banach–Alaoglu theorem.

In the unital commutative case, for the formula_1-algebra formula_76 of continuous functions on some compact formula_77, Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem says that the positive functionals of norm formula_78 are precisely the Borel positive measures on formula_77 with total mass formula_78. It follows from Krein–Milman theorem that the extremal states are the Dirac point-mass measures.

On the other hand, a representation of formula_76 is irreducible if and only if it is one-dimensional. Therefore, the GNS representation of formula_76 corresponding to a measure formula_83 is irreducible if and only if formula_83 is an extremal state. This is in fact true for formula_1-algebras in general.

To prove this result one notes first that a representation is irreducible if and only if the commutant of formula_86, denoted by formula_87, consists of scalar multiples of the identity.

Any positive linear functionals formula_88 on formula_2 dominated by formula_30 is of the form
formula_91
for some positive operator formula_92 in formula_87 with formula_94 in the operator order. This is a version of the Radon–Nikodym theorem.

For such formula_88, one can write formula_30 as a sum of positive linear functionals: formula_97. So formula_11 is unitarily equivalent to a subrepresentation of formula_99. This shows that π is irreducible if and only if any such formula_100 is unitarily equivalent to formula_11, i.e. formula_88 is a scalar multiple of formula_30, which proves the theorem.

Extremal states are usually called pure states. Note that a state is a pure state if and only if it is extremal in the convex set of states.

The theorems above for formula_1-algebras are valid more generally in the context of formula_105-algebras with approximate identity.

== Generalizations ==

The Stinespring factorization theorem characterizing completely positive maps is an important generalization of the GNS construction.

== History ==
Gelfand and Naimark&#x27;s paper on the Gelfand–Naimark theorem was published in 1943. Segal recognized the construction that was implicit in this work and presented it in sharpened form.

In his paper of 1947 Segal showed that it is sufficient, for any physical system that can be described by an algebra of operators on a Hilbert space, to consider the &quot;irreducible&quot; representations of a formula_1-algebra. In quantum theory this means that the formula_1-algebra is generated by the observables. This, as Segal pointed out, had been shown earlier by John von Neumann only for the specific case of the non-relativistic Schrödinger-Heisenberg theory.

<doc id="297448" wikidata="Q715919" url="?curid=297448" title="John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter">
<text>John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter, 1st Earl of Huntingdon ( 1352 – 16 January 1400) of Dartington Hall in Devon, was a half-brother of King Richard II (1377–1399), to whom he remained strongly loyal. He is primarily remembered for being suspected of assisting in the downfall of King Richard&#x27;s uncle Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester (1355–1397) (youngest son of King Edward III) and then for conspiring against King Richard&#x27;s first cousin and eventual deposer, Henry Bolingbroke, later King Henry IV (1399–1413).

==Origins==

He was the third son of Thomas Holland by his wife Joan of Kent, &quot;The Fair Maid of Kent&quot;. Joan was daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, a son of King Edward I (1272–1307), and Thomas would be made Earl of Kent, in what is considered a new creation, as husband of Joan, in whom the former Earldom was vested as eventual heiress of Edmund of Woodstock. Joan later married Edward the Black Prince, the eldest son and heir apparent of her first cousin King Edward III, by whom she had a son, King Richard II, who was thus a half-brother of John Holland.

==Political career==

Early in King Richard&#x27;s reign, Holland was made a Knight of the Garter (1381). He was also part of the escort that accompanied the queen-to-be, Anne of Bohemia, on her trip to England.

Holland had a violent temper, which got him in trouble several times. The most famous incident occurred during Richard II&#x27;s 1385 expedition to Scotland. An archer in the service of Ralph Stafford, eldest son of Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford, killed one of Holland&#x27;s esquires. Stafford went to find Holland to apologize, but Holland killed him as soon as he identified himself. King Richard thereupon ordered the forfeiture of Holland&#x27;s lands. The mother of both Holland and Richard II, Joan of Kent, died shortly afterwards, it was said of grief at the quarrel between her sons.

Early in 1386 Holland reconciled with the Staffords, and had his property restored. Later in 1386 he married Elizabeth of Lancaster, a daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (younger brother of the Black Prince), by his wife Blanche of Lancaster. He and Elizabeth then went on Gaunt&#x27;s expedition to Spain, where Holland was appointed constable of the English army. After his return to England, on 2 June 1388 Holland was created Earl of Huntingdon, by Act of Parliament. In 1389 he was appointed Lord Great Chamberlain for life, Admiral of the Fleet in the Western Seas, and constable of Tintagel Castle in Cornwall. During this time he also received large grants of land from King Richard.

Over the next few years he held a number of additional offices: Constable of Conway Castle (1394); Governor of Carlisle Castle (1395); Warden (1398), later Constable-General, of the West Marches towards Scotland. His military service was interrupted by a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1394.

In 1397 Holland had marched with King Richard to arrest the latter&#x27;s uncle Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, and Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel, and later seized and held Arundel Castle at the king&#x27;s request. As a reward, on 29 September 1397 he was created Duke of Exeter.

In 1399 he accompanied King Richard on his expedition to Ireland. Following their return the king sent him to try to negotiate with his own first cousin and Holland&#x27;s brother-in-law Henry Bolingbroke, son of John of Gaunt. After Bolingbroke deposed Richard in 1399 and took the throne as King Henry IV (1399–1413), he called to account those who had been involved in the arrest and downfall of his uncle Thomas of Woodstock, and confiscated all rewards and titles received by them from King Richard. Thus Holland was stripped of his dukedom, becoming again merely Earl of Huntingdon.

Early in 1400 Holland entered into a conspiracy, known as the Epiphany Rising, with his nephew Thomas Holland, Earl of Kent, and with Thomas le Despencer, 1st Earl of Gloucester, and others. Their aim was to assassinate King Henry and his sons, and to return Richard, then in prison, to the throne. The plot failed and Holland fled, but was caught, near Pleshey Castle in Essex, and executed on 16 January 1400. Among those who witnessed the execution was Arundel&#x27;s son, Thomas Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel.

Holland&#x27;s lands and titles were forfeited, but eventually they were restored to his second son John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1386 he married Elizabeth of Lancaster, a daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (younger brother of the Black Prince) by his wife Blanche of Lancaster, by whom he had children including:

===Sons===
* Richard Holland (died 3 September 1400), eldest son and heir, who survived his father only 7 months
*John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon (1395–1447), second son, to whom was restored his father&#x27;s dukedom in 1426. In the interim, the title had been bestowed upon Thomas Beaufort, who died childless in 1426.
*Sir Edward Holland (c. 1399 – after 1413)

===Daughters===
*Constance Holland (1387–1437), married first Thomas Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk, married second Sir John Grey, 
*Elizabeth Holland (c. 1389 – 1449)
*Alice Holland (c. 1392 – c. 1406), married Richard de Vere, 11th Earl of Oxford

==Death==
He was executed on 16 January 1400, following the failure of the Epiphany Rising conspiracy against King Henry IV.

His body was buried at the collegiate church in Pleshey. His tomb remained until the late 16th century, when, along with many other tombs in the church, it was broken up for use as building material. Only a fragment remained within the church by the start of the 17th century.

<text>Pushkin () is a municipal town in Pushkinsky District of the federal city of St. Petersburg, Russia, located south from the center of St. Petersburg proper, and its railway station, Tsarskoye Selo, is directly connected by railway to the Vitebsky Rail Terminal of the city.

Pushkin was founded in 1710 as an imperial residence named &quot;Tsarskoye Selo&quot; () and received status of a town in 1808. The first public railways in Russia, Tsarskoye Selo Railways, were opened here in 1837 and connected the town to the capital, St. Petersburg. After the October Revolution, the town was renamed to &quot;Detskoye Selo&quot; (). Its name was further changed in 1937 to Pushkin to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The town contains an ensemble of the 18th century Tsarskoye Selo. This museum complex includes the Catherine Palace, Alexander Palace and other buildings and associated parks; it is a major tourist attraction in the area and is included in the list of monuments protected by the UNESCO.

==History==
===Establishment of a settlement===
In 1609–1702, on the place of Catherine Palace stood a Swedish estate, which in Finnish was known as &quot;Saaren moisio&quot; (). Traditionally Ingrian Finns have called the area as Saaren kylä (village of Saari) or Saari, meaning &quot;island&quot; in Finnish (). It was a small estate, which consisted of a wooden house, household annexes, and a modest garden divided by two perpendicular avenues into four squares. This estate originated from an earlier settlement, which was mentioned in church inventories of 1501 and marked on maps drawn for Boris Godunov as Saritsa (). This name later transformed to Sarskaya Manor (), then to Saar Village, and finally became the Sarskoye Selo, which easily developed further as Tsarskoye Selo (meaning &quot;Tsar&#x27;s Village&quot; in Russian).

After the expulsion of the Swedes from the area Peter the Great gave the manor to Alexander Menshikov. Later, by an official decree of 13 June 1710 the whole area including 43 villages was assigned to Marfa Skavronskaya, wife of Peter who later became Empress Catherine I. This date of 13 June 1710 is considered as the founding date of the city. In 1717–1724 the architect Johann Braunstein built here a two-storied stone palace surrounded by ancillary buildings, and Y. V. Roozen created a garden with two ponds at the palace. Because of the growing number of servants, a separate village and a wooden Uspenskaya Church (1716) were built nearby. Around then the Sarskaya Mansion transformed into Tsarskoye Selo. The first street of the city, Perednyaya Street (meaning &quot;Front Street&quot;, now Sadovaya Street) was established in 1720. Construction of the Znamenskaya Church, the oldest stone building in the city, started in 1734.

===Imperial residence===
During the reign of Elizabeth, Tsarskoye Selo became the imperial residence. In 1740-50s the modest palace of Catherine I was rebuilt into a luxurious summer residence, the Catherine Palace. Between 1751 and 1756 the reconstruction was led by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, and the present look of the palace has not changed much since then. In 1755, the Amber Room was moved from the Winter Palace to the Catherine Palace. The gardens were extended and decorated with sculptures and pavilions. A canal was dug from Vittolovsky Springs ( from the Tsarskoye Selo) to provide water for the park ponds, and several stone houses were built on the Perednyaya Street.

The inflow of people to the area in the 1770s urged Catherine II to separate the Tsarskoye Selo from the urban area. By the decree of January 1780 she established a town Sofia nearby with a separate administration. Further construction works without imperial orders were banned in Tsarskoye Selo and most merchants and clergy were moved to Sofia. The town was divided into rectangular districts with a vast open place in the center. A wooden church of Saints Constantine and Helen and then the stone Sophia Cathedral (1788) were raised in the town center. According to Johann Gottlieb Georgi, in 1794, Sofia was mostly populated by the palace workers and peasants. It had a number of stone buildings, a church resembling Hagia Sophia of Constantinople, and a factory in the suburbs producing paper for state bank notes. The town prospered owing to the proximity of St. Petersburg and imperial attention.

===Town===


A new park which later became Alexander Park was established in the 1770s to the west of the Catherine Palace, and in 1792–1795 Giacomo Quarenghi built the Alexander Palace at the north-eastern border of the park for the future emperor Alexander I. In 1808, Alexander I merged the Tsarskoye Selo with Sofia and proclaimed it a town and the seat of Tsarskoselsky Uyezd. In 1808, he appointed William Heste as the town architect, which post he held until his death in 1832. Heste compiled a master plan for Tsarskoye Selo, with division into quarters and associated gardens and orchards. Most residents moved from Sofia to Tsarskoye Selo and the former was converted to a residence of a military regiment. By 1817, Tsarskoye Selo had 15 streets, 354 buildings and a population of 4,000.

The Catherine Palace suffered from the fire of 1820 and was reconstructed by the architect Vasily Stasov. He also designed several buildings in classical style, namely the Manezh, Stable Building and Grand Orangery. Between 1811 and 1843 a wing of the Catherine Palace hosted the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum where Aleksandr Pushkin studied between 1811 and 1817. Several historical objects were created in those decades including the iron Egyptian gates by Adam Menelaws.

The first public railway in the Russian Empire, Tsarskoselskaya Railway, was laid in 1837 and connected Tsarskoye Selo with the capital St. Petersburg. Its length was about and the journey time about 40 minutes. The prominent Catherine Cathedral was built in 1840. The town was expanding and by 1855 had 44 streets, 10 churches, 400 houses, 8 military barracks, 3 hospitals and a female seminary. Tsarskoye Selo was one of the most developed cities of Russia. In 1887 it became the first fully electrified town in Europe, and by the end of the 19th century had a telephone network.

In 1905, the Alexander Palace became the main residence of the Nicholas II. Here the royal family was held under house arrest after the February Revolution. In 1902–1908 the town was equipped with the most advanced by the time water system with a separate network and a water purification station. By 1909 the town had 30,000 residents and 19 schools. In 1910, an Imperial garrison camp was established to the north of the Catherine Palace, on the border of Alexander Park and the city. It had a separate cathedral (Fedorovskiy Cathedral), a dining hall, and two hospitals, one for officers and one for soldiers. The first bus route was opened in 1911, and in 1914 a powerful for the time 300-kilowatt wireless telegraphy station was built in the city. Léon Theremin worked at that station in 1918–1919.

===Soviet period===
In 1918, after the October Revolution, the palace and park complex was declared as museum and national property. On 7 November 1918 it was renamed to Detskoye Selo (, &quot;Children&#x27;s Village&quot;), because of the large number of children&#x27;s institutions established in the area, and due to a general trend to rename Tsar-related geographical names. On 10 February 1937, on the occasion of the 100-year anniversary of the death of Aleksandr Pushkin, the town was given his name. On 10 June 1939, the Catherine Cathedral was demolished by the Soviet authorities.

After the start of World War II, on 17 September 1941, the town was occupied by the German troops. Several buildings of the palace complex were destroyed or damaged and many artworks were abducted, including the entire inner decoration of the Amber Room. The town was liberated on 24 January 1944 as a result of the Krasnoye Selo–Ropsha Offensive.

Restoration of the palace complex was initiated already during the war. Public access was gradually re-established to the parks (1946), lyceum (1949) and six palace halls (1959). The Amber Room was restored only by 2003. The town was rebuilt in 1950-1960s. Several factories were established in the eastern part of Pushkin and in Sofia and two prominent monuments were raised in 1960, to Vladimir Lenin (sculptor Zair Azgur) and Ernst Thälmann (sculptor Arnold). In 1975, the town was equipped with a new water system and modern sewage treatment facilities, which were upgraded in 1999–2005 within a joint Russian-Finnish-Swedish project.

===Post-Soviet period===
Since the early 1990s Pushkin became a luxury housing development area. Notable festivals are conducted every year on the weekend after the City Day (24 June). International carnivals are conducted in the town from 1995 and from 2000 Pushkin is a member of the Federation of European Carnival Cities. Large scale cleanup and reconstruction of the town was conducted before the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the town (24 June 2010). In April 2004 vandals pushed the monument of Lenin from its pedestal breaking the statue. The reconstruction of the Catherine Cathedral began on the place of the monument on 7 December 2006. Another monument of Lenin was heavily damaged on 6 December 2010 in an explosion staged by an unknown group.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms of Tsarskoye Selo was adopted on 12 March 1831 as a crowned monogram of Catherine I. It was however not the emblem of the city, but only of the imperial residence. Two town emblems were proposed by Baron Bernhard Karl von Koehne, one in 1859 and another in 1882, but neither was accepted.

In Soviet times the town had no coat of arms. In 1990, the coat of arms of 1831 was registered as the emblem of Museum &quot;Tsarskoye Selo&quot; and for this reason could not be approved as a symbol of the city. The Decree of Pushkin City Council of 15 March 2001 approved the following coat of arms. It featured an oval shield with the monogram of Catherine I on red background. The shield was topped with a golden crown and had golden laurel branches underneath. On 25 March 2010, Pushkin Municipal Council approved the current four-panel coat of arms. Two of its panels feature identical crowned monograms of Catherine I on red background, and the other two parts depict a black double-headed eagle of the Catherine II era on a purple background. The eagle has a red tongue, golden beaks and claws and three crowns. In its right paw the eagle holds a silver torch burning with gold flame and in the left paw it has a two-legged silver anchor without a cross bar. The eagle&#x27;s breast is covered with a blue oval shield with a silver cross on it; the rim of the shield is formed by a snake biting its tail. This 4-part coat is named as &quot;extended&quot; or &quot;big&quot; () whereas its one part with the Catherine I monogram is called &quot;small&quot; () and is also an official coat of arms of Pushkin.
==Geology==
The town is located on the Neva Lowland, on the left bank of the river Neva. The landscape is quite varied and contains hills, ridges and terraces intermixed with valleys, plains, forests and farmland. Numerous springs give rise to streams and feed ponds. In the Paleozoic era, 300–400 million years ago, the area was covered by a sea. Sediments of that time form a layer thicker than on top of the Baltic Shield consisting of granite, gneiss and diabase. The modern topography was shaped by the glacier retreat some 12,000 years ago which created the Littorina Sea. About 4,000 years ago the sea receded and formed the valley of the Neva River which has not changed much over the last 2,500 years.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
The climate in Pushkin is temperate and wet, it is transitional between oceanic and continental. The length of the day varies from 5 hours and 51 minutes in the winter solstice to 18 hours and 50 minutes in the summer solstice. Summer is short and moderately warm, whereas winter is long and uneven, with frequent thaws. Air temperatures above prevail from early April to mid-November. The coldest month is February. Winds mostly blow southward and frequently change air mass above the city. Summer is dominated by westerly and northwesterly winds, and the wind direction changes to westerly and southwesterly in winter. The cloudiest months are November, December and January, and the least cloudy are May, June and July. There are at least 240 sunny days per year. Between May 25 and July 16, white nights are observed when the sun only briefly goes over the horizon and the day lasts nearly 19 hours. The area is mostly fed by surface and ground waters.

==Soil, vegetation and wildlife==
Prior to the founding of the town the area was covered by temperate coniferous forests (mostly pine and fir) with an admixture of broad-leaved trees and fens. The soils were mostly podzol, combined with peat and gleysols. Intensive economic activities changed the original forest landscape to agricultural land with small groves of aspen, birch, alder and willow. In the 18–19th centuries, a large park area of 704 hectares has been created in and around the city. Owing to the parks and environment-friendly policies, the Pushkin area has relatively low level of pollution. There is a large number of birds, reptiles and invertebrates; also common are hare and muskrat.

==Population==
Working-age population makes 63% of the total, 13% are younger and 24% are older than the working age. The number of children born in 2008 was 1278; this is 137 more than in 2007, yet this about half of the value required for population replacement; 285 children were born by unmarried mothers. 1471 marriage and 742 divorce acts were registered in 2009. The fraction of women in the total population is 54%, and the difference is especially large (2700 women per 1000 men) for citizen outside of working age. The average age of residents is 40 years and is increasing. During 11 months of 2009, 19,316 foreign nationals were registered in Pushkin, that is 3,500 more than in 2008.

==Local government==
The Pushkin Municipal Council consists of twenty deputies who are elected in municipal elections in four multi-member electoral districts formed on the territory of the municipality, with the number of deputy mandates to be distributed in one district equal to five. As a result of the elections on 14 September 2014, the 5th convocation was elected. All 20 deputies are from United Russia (four resigned). In 2019, 18 deputies were elected to the VI convocation, of which 10 deputies were nominated by United Russia, four by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, two by Yabloko, one by A Just Russia – For Truth, and one self-nominated candidate.

==Layout and architecture of the town==
The modern layout of Pushkin was developed in the early 20th century, it consists of two main parts. The northeastern part (old Tsarskoye Selo) contains the oldest streets of the city, such as Sadovaya, Srednyaya and Malaya, and has the Cathedral Square in its center. At the request of Alexander I this part was surrounded by the Catherine and Alexander parks from the south and west and by the October and Sofia boulevards from the east and north. Yet, this part of the town has been constantly expanding, to the east up to the railroad and to the north up to Detskoselskiy boulevard. The southern part of the town is the former town of Sofia, planned by Catherine II and centered at the Sofia Square. To the north, east and west of this part lie the Catherine, Babolovo and Otdelny parks. The railroad to Pavlovsk and Vitebsk runs through the eastern border of the city.

The major attractions of the town are described below.

===State Museum-Reserve &quot;Tsarskoye Selo&quot;===
This palace and park ensemble of 18th–19th centuries served as the royal residence and was converted into a museum after the nationalization in March 1918. It received its current status of museum-reserve in 1992. Restoration of the museum is partly supported by the World Bank; about US$4 million has been spent by 2008 and some US$3.2 million more is required to complete the restoration. The museum-reserve includes:

====Catherine Park====
The park is named in honor of the Empress Catherine I of Russia. It occupies an area of 107 hectares and consists of the regular Old Garden (1717–1720) and an English garden (1760–1796, architect Vasily Neyelov) separated by large ponds. The park includes numerous pavilions of significant architectural and historical value. Most of them have been restored.
====Catherine Palace====
The original palace of 1717–1723 was rebuilt in 1743–1756, first by Mikhail Zemtsov, A. V. Kvasov and Savva Chevakinsky and then by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Rastrelli was the primary author of the architectural design and lush sculptural decoration of the façade, in the style of Russian Baroque; he also designed the interior layout and decoration. The main courtyard is facing west and has a gilded wrought-iron fence and gates. The palace is surrounded by a few buildings added in the late 18th century. One of them is a four-story outhouse to the south, which hosted the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum and was then converted into a museum, a branch of the All Russian Pushkin Museum. Lyceum is connected with the palace by an arch over Sadovaya Street (architect I. Neelov). Other attachments to the palace include Zubovsky wing on the southern side (architect Y. M. Felton) and Cameron&#x27;s Gallery, cold saunas and a hanging garden to the southeast. One of the most famous rooms of the palace is the Amber Room.

====Alexander Park====
The park occupies an area of 120 hectares next to the main entrance. It consists of a regular part (the New Garden, 1740s, N. Girard) and the Landscape Park (1790s) with three ponds and artificial mounds. River Kuzminka, partitioned by a dam, flows in the western part of the park. Unfortunately, most monuments in the park are in a deteriorating condition.
====Alexander Palace====
This classical palace was built in 1792–1796 by Giacomo Quarenghi for Alexander I. The palace is an elongated two-storey building with double wings on either side and a two-row colonnade on the northern side. Next to the palace is a vast park with a lake.

<text>The Manitoba Schools Question () was a political crisis in the Canadian province of Manitoba that occurred late in the 19th century, attacking publicly-funded separate schools for Roman Catholics and Protestants. The crisis was precipitated by a series of provincial laws passed between 1890 and 1896, and another passed in 1916.

The crisis eventually spread to the national level, becoming one of the key issues in the federal election of 1896 and resulted in the defeat of the Conservative government, which had been in power for most of the previous thirty years.

Because of the close linkage at that time between religion and language, the Schools Question raised the deeper question whether French would survive as a language or a culture in Western Canada. The result of the crisis was that, by 1916, English was left as the only official language in use in the province until 1985. As French was no longer an official language, its use declined greatly. Moreover, the Schools Question, along with the execution of Louis Riel in 1885, was one of the incidents that led to strengthening of French Canadian nationalism in Quebec.

== Background ==
=== Foundation of Manitoba (1870) ===
Manitoba became the first western province to join Confederation in 1870. The province was created through negotiations between Canada and the provisional Red River government of Louis Riel, following the Red River Resistance/Rebellion. One of the key issues in the negotiations was the question of control of education in the new province. There was considerable pressure for a system of denominational schools in the new province, for both Protestants and Roman Catholics. Although framed as a religious issue, there was also a question of language-politics involved, since at that time, most Protestants in Manitoba were anglophones and most Roman Catholics were francophones. Religious control over education thus also related to the language of education.

The Act of Parliament that created the province, the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;, responded to these concerns by giving the province the power to pass laws relating to education, but also by giving constitutional protection to denominational school rights which existed &quot;by Law or practice in the Province at the Union.&quot; The exact meaning of this provision, and the scope of the constitutional protection it provided, subsequently became a matter of considerable political and legal debate.

=== Political and demographic developments (1870–90) ===
Soon after the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; was passed to create the province, settlers from English Canada, mainly Ontario, began to arrive in greater numbers than they had come prior to the Red River Rebellion.

The &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; had given equal rights to Protestant and Roman Catholic schools, but by the 1880s, this no longer reflected the linguistic makeup of the province. Many Métis had left, and settlers from Quebec were not as numerous as those from Ontario. As the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed in 1886, many more English-speaking settlers had begun to arrive.

=== Manitoba legislation (1890–94) ===
The Manitoba schools crisis was precipitated by a series of provincial laws passed between 1890 and 1896 and another passed in 1916.

The &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; of 1870 had provided that English and French be co-official languages in the newly created Province of Manitoba (which initially included only part of southern Manitoba centred on the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers). However, in March 1890, the Manitoba Legislature passed the Official Language Act, making English the only official language in the province. Two years later, in 1892, the neighbouring Northwest Territories (which at the time covered the Canadian Prairies west and northwest of Manitoba) also abolished French as an official language.

Although the abolition of French as an official language did not directly affect the Schools Question, it strengthened the controversy, given the ties between religious schools and the language of education.

When the Province was created, the new provincial government established a system of denominational schools funded by provincial taxes. However, in the same month as the &quot;Official Language Act&quot;, the Manitoba Legislature passed two bills amending the province’s laws on education: &quot;An Act respecting the Department of Education&quot; and &quot;An Act respecting Public Schools&quot; (or, the &quot;Public Schools Act&quot;).

The &quot;Department of Education&quot; &quot;Act&quot; created a Department of Education and turned the two sections of the Board of Education into only one. The &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; divested funding for Catholic and Protestant denominational schools, establishing instead a system of tax-supported, non-sectarian public schools. In other words, the Act removed the denominational school districts, and in doing so, the French language remained while the Catholic religion did not. If Catholics (mostly francophone) wished to continue education in their religion, they would now have to fund their own schools, in addition to paying taxes for public schools.

Passing this legislation was the response of Premier Thomas Greenway to the popular demand to abolish Manitoba&#x27;s dual-school system, as many claimed that Catholics were receiving more funds from the province than their numbers warranted and that the quality of education in Catholic schools was poor. The question was whether this legislation was consistent with s. 22(1) of the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;.

In 1894, Greenway&#x27;s government also prohibited municipalities from making expenditures to assist schools outside of the public system. As Catholic parents were limited in their ability to pay for their children’s schooling, this prohibition would ultimately result in the reduction in the number of Catholic schools. While the great majority of these schools maintained their Catholic and private status, many were forced to join the public system. For French-speaking Catholics, the issue of religious education became an issue of identity.

Two rounds of litigation were the result, in each case going to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the highest court in the British Empire. The legislation also triggered considerable national political debate.

== Initial crisis (1891–96) ==

=== Litigations ===
Manitoba&#x27;s legislation resulted in two rounds of litigation, each going to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

==== City of Winnipeg (1891–92) ====
The first court case, &quot;Barrett v. City of Winnipeg&quot; (1891), focused on whether the &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; conflicted with the constitutional protection for denominational schools set out in s. 22 of the 1870 &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;. Catholics in Manitoba, encouraged by the federal government of Prime Minister John A. Macdonald, challenged the constitutionality of the 1890 Act in the Queen&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba, arguing that the requirement to pay taxes to the new public school interfered with their rights under s. 22. The Manitoba Queen&#x27;s Bench held that the new &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; was valid.

The challengers then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Barrett v. Winnipeg&quot; (1891), which allowed the appeal and held that the 1890 &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; &quot;transgresses the limits of the power given&quot; by s. 22 of the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;. Based on the Supreme Court decision, another action was brought in the Manitoba Queen&#x27;s Bench, which followed the Supreme Court decision and quashed a school tax assessment under the 1890 Act.

The City of Winnipeg then appealed both cases to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain which overruled the Supreme Court and held that the 1890 Act was consistent with the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;.

The exact point in dispute was the meaning of the phrase &quot;...by Law or practice in the Province at the Union,&quot; used in s. 22(1) of the &quot;Manitoba Act.&quot; The Judicial Committee held that this provision did not itself create a system of denominational schools. Rather, it gave constitutional protection to whatever rights existed with respect to denominational schools in Manitoba in 1870. The Judicial Committee reviewed the historical record and concluded that in 1870, all schools in Manitoba were funded by the religious groups which ran them, and not by any system of public taxation. As a result, the Judicial Committee concluded that s. 22(1) simply guaranteed the right of religious groups to establish and run their own schools, at their own expense. It did not guarantee any public funding for denominational schools, since there was no financial tax support for denominational schools in 1870. Taxpayer funding for denominational schools was only established after the foundation of the Province and was not guaranteed by s. 22(1) of the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870.&quot; The Legislature therefore could end taxpayer funding for denominational schools and instead establishing a system of taxpayer funded non-sectarian schools, without being in breach of s. 22(1).

==== &quot;Brophy v. Manitoba&quot; (1894) ====

Although education is normally a matter of exclusive provincial jurisdiction under the Constitution of Canada, there is a special power for the federal government in relation to separate schools. Section 93(3) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; provides that there is an appeal to the Governor General in Council &quot;from any Act or Decision of any Provincial Authority affecting any Right or Privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic Minority of the Queen&#x27;s Subjects in relation to Education.&quot; Section 93(4) provides that if a province does not comply with a decision of the Governor-in-Council in an appeal under s. 93(3), then Parliament has the power to enact &quot;remedial Laws for the due Execution of the Provisions of this Section and of any Decision of the Governor General in Council under this Section.&quot;

Section 22 of the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; had similar provisions authorising an appeal to the Governor General in Council and remedial legislation by Parliament.

Following the 1892 Privy Council decision in &quot;City of Winnipeg v. Barrett&quot;, pressure arose for the federal government to take action under these provisions. However, it was not clear if the changes to the Manitoba school system set out by the 1890 &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; were sufficient to authorise the federal government to hear an appeal and to enact remedial legislation, in light of the Privy Council&#x27;s conclusion that the system of taxpayer funded denominational schools which were established in the early 1870s was not constitutionally protected.

To resolve this uncertainty, the federal government referred the matter to the Supreme Court of Canada as a reference question, asking if these constitutional provisions applied. The Supreme Court held that those provisions did not apply, since the post-1870 denominational schools were not constitutionally protected. This decision was appealed to the Privy Council, which overturned the Supreme Court. The Privy Council held that when the Province had created a system of taxpayer funded denominational schools in the early 1870s, it had given a &quot;right or privilege&quot; to the Protestants and Roman Catholics in relation to education. Although that &quot;right or privilege&quot; was not constitutionally entrenched by s. 22(1) of the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;, the abolition of the denominational schools could be appealed to the federal government under s. 22(2) of the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;, and Parliament could enact remedial legislation under s. 22(3).

=== Political crisis in the Federal government (1894–96) ===
The &quot;Schools Question&quot;, as it was known, had divided the Conservative government since 1890, and especially after Macdonald&#x27;s death in 1891 when no strong leader replaced him. However, so long as education remained an exclusively provincial jurisdiction, the federal government had limited powers to intervene. In light of the Privy Council decision in &quot;Brophy v. Manitoba&quot;, the political situation changed. The federal government now had the authority to act; the question was whether it would.

In January 1896, the federal government of Prime Minister Mackenzie Bowell introduced remedial legislation under s. 22(3) of the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; in the House of Commons. However, the draft legislation was very unpopular with some members of the Conservative caucus, and its introduction triggered a political crisis. Faced with a caucus revolt, Bowell was forced to call an election and to resign in April of that year. Following the election call, with the remedial bill not passed by Parliament, Charles Tupper led the Conservatives in the election and became Prime Minister, though not for long.

The Liberal Party under Wilfrid Laurier, himself a French Catholic, took on a vigorous campaign to prevent the bill from being passed before the government called another election (expected to be in June 1896).

The election of 1896 was centred on the Schools Question. It especially divided Conservatives in Quebec and Ontario; French Catholic Quebecers were offended that French was being eliminated in Manitoba as an official language, while Ontario saw opposition to Catholic support by the strong Orange Order. The Liberals, under Laurier, took advantage of the division in the Conservative party.

Laurier, considering Québec&#x27;s &quot;Jesuits’ Estates Act&quot;—which drew significant reactions from Ontario&#x27;s Orange Order—proposed what he called &quot;the sunny way,&quot; i.e., achieving a solution through diplomatic negotiations rather than imposing one through legislation, stating during the federal election campaign:If it were in my power, I would try the sunny way. I would approach this man Greenway with the sunny way of patriotism, asking him to be just and to be fair, asking him to be generous to the minority, in order that we may have peace among all the creeds and races which it has pleased God to bring upon this corner of our common country. Do you not believe that there is more to be gained by appealing to the heart and soul of men rather than to compel them to do a thing?Laurier won the election and became the 7th Prime Minister of Canada.

=== Laurier–Greenway Compromise, 1896 ===
This particular period of the Manitoba schools crisis ended on 16 November 1896 upon a compromise developed between Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier and Premier of Manitoba Thomas Greenway, called the Laurier–Greenway Compromise (officially titled the &quot;Terms of Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Manitoba for the Settlement of the School Question&quot;), which amended the &quot;Public Schools Act&quot;. This agreement did not reverse the 1890 legislation; instead, it allowed for religious instruction (i.e., Catholic education) in Manitoba&#x27;s public schools, under certain conditions, for 30 minutes at the end of each day. Moreover, French (like other minority languages) could be used in teaching, but also under certain conditions: only on a school-by-school basis requiring there to be a minimum of 10 French-speaking pupils. They also re-established a Catholic school board, but without government funding, and Catholic teachers could be hired in the public schools, also under particular conditions.

Many Catholics were still opposed to this compromise, and even appealed to Pope Leo XIII. The Pope sent an observer, who concluded, like Laurier, that the compromise was the fairest one possible with so few Catholics left in the province.

== Repeal and resistance (1916–23) ==

=== &quot;Thornton Act&quot; ===
The next part of the crisis came in March 1916, when, with the &quot;Thornton Act&quot;, the government of Tobias Norris repealed the &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; amendments made from the Laurier-Greenway Compromise, which allowed for bilingual instruction in Manitoba&#x27;s public schools. The teaching of any non-English language, as well as the use of such language as a language of instruction, were thereby prohibited in these schools. Moreover, the new legislation also made it so that all new teachers in Manitoba would be trained in English only, as it forced the closure of St. Boniface&#x27;s French-language teachers’ college.

There were two central reasons behind Norris&#x27; repeal. First, in the late 19th century, Canada experienced a large, unforeseen wave of immigration, and as result, Manitoba saw an increase in the number of nationalities represented and languages spoken. The issue was that, due to the Laurier-Greenway Compromise allowing for instruction in minority languages, such made the school system less effective in imposing English as the province&#x27;s dominant language. The second reason was that, at the time, the level of education of Manitoba&#x27;s population as a whole was quite poor. (This was more so a problem caused by the lack of truancy-oriented laws, rather than an issue of language.)

=== Francophone resistance ===
It was at this point that Franco-Manitobans began to organize resistance in order to ensure the survival of their language in the province.

Established that very year (1916) was the (AÉCFM; ), which was directed from the shadows by the clergy, and was described as a kind of francophone counterpart to the provincial Department of Education. The AÉCFM encouraged francophone instructors to continue teaching French and to keep using it as a language of instruction without the knowledge of the authorities, even if this required lying to school inspectors. Some school inspectors themselves looked the other way to French being taught at public schools; if an inspector or someone else were to report a teacher for teaching French, the association would assuredly defend them.

At the municipal level, the hiring of teaching staff was the responsibility of school board trustees. Francophones controlled many small local school boards, using the opportunity of this position to hire mostly francophone Catholics.

From 1923 to 1966, AÉCFM held an annual French contest for students in grades 4 through 12 in order to strengthen pride in the French language in the province, publishing contest results in &quot;La Liberté&quot;, a French-language newspaper in Manitoba. The winners would then be sent to Québec, where they represented their province at the Canada-wide competition. The AÉCFM officially disbanded in 1968.

== Aftermath (1947–) ==
In the mid 20th century, French gradually began to regain its place in the education system of Manitoba.

Circa 1947, Manitoba authorized the teaching of French as a foreign language in its secondary schools. In 1955, Premier Douglas L. Campbell and his Liberal government allowed the teaching of French in grades 4 through 6. In 1959, the Department of Education approved a list of French-language textbooks. In 1967, Premier Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s government authorized the use of French, for up to half of the school day, as the language of instruction for other subjects. In 1970, Premier Edward Schreyer&#x27;s government made French a language of instruction equal to English. Consequently, in 1973, Sister Léonne Dumesnil founded Manitoba’s first French-immersion school, École Sacré-Cœur, in Winnipeg.

Manitoba&#x27;s (BEF; ) was established 1975 in order to support the development of education in French. The following year, the position of Deputy Minister for French Education was created.

In 1993, a francophone school division was created under the passing of the &quot;Public Schools Amendment (francophone Schools Governance) Act&quot;. The next year, the new &quot;Division scolaire franco-manitobaine&quot; (Franco-Manitoban School Division) took under its wing 20 French schools with over 4,000 students. The Division has since expanded to 24 educational institutions (including 1 adult learning centre) as of 2016, with a total of some 5,200 students.

<text>Mark William Prior (born September 7, 1980) is an American former professional baseball pitcher and current coach. A onetime top prospect of the Chicago Cubs, he pitched for the team from 2002 to 2006 in a career that was marred by injuries. In his prime, his repertoire of pitches included a mid-90s mph fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. He is currently the pitching coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Born and raised in San Diego, California, Prior engaged Tom House as his pitching tutor in high school. A career at the University of Southern California, where he won the Golden Spikes Award, saw him become one of the top prospects in the 2001 MLB draft, when he was the second overall pick by the Cubs. He made only nine appearances in the minor leagues before debuting with the team in 2002. In 2003, he finished third in National League (NL) Cy Young Award voting, ranking among the leaders with 18 wins, a 2.43 earned run average (ERA), and 245 strikeouts. Helping the Cubs win the NL Central title, he outpitched Greg Maddux in the NL Division Series and won Game 2 of the NL Championship Series, but he was on the mound for Game 6 when Steve Bartman prevented Moisés Alou from catching a foul ball.

Prior had pitched a scoreless game up to this point, but the Florida Marlins went on to win the series in seven games after an eighth inning eight-run rally in that game, in which Prior received the loss. In 2004, he was on the disabled list twice but finished the season with a 16-strikeout performance against the Cincinnati Reds. He made 27 starts with the Cubs in 2005 and finished ninth in the NL in strikeouts despite missing some time due to injury. Multiple injuries limited him to nine games in 2006, and he did not pitch at all in 2007 due to tears in his labrum, anterior capsule, and rotator cuff. After the season, the Cubs non-tendered him, letting him become a free agent.

Prior never pitched in the major leagues again after that, though he tried several times. He pitched in the minor leagues for multiple organizations over the next six years before finally retiring at the end of the 2013 season. Once touted as having &quot;perfect&quot; pitching mechanics by &quot;ESPN&quot; and others, his &quot;Inverted W&quot; arm action has been discussed as a possible reason for his lack of durability, as well as Dusty Baker&#x27;s heavy usage of him during the 2003 season, though Prior himself does not blame Baker for his injuries. Prior accepted a front office position with the San Diego Padres in 2013, then joined the Dodgers in 2018 as a bullpen coach, becoming their pitching coach in 2020.

==Amateur career==
Born September 7, 1980, in San Diego, California, Prior was part of an athletic family. Jerry, his father, played college football for Vanderbilt University, and both of Mark&#x27;s older siblings played sports as well. &quot;Being the youngest of three kids, there&#x27;s no room for me to step out of line,&quot; he quipped. Growing up, Prior attended the University of San Diego High School. As a sophomore, he worked with former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher Tom House, who had a business of tutoring young pitchers. Using computer analysis to try to determine the ideal pitching motion, House worked with Prior on his delivery and prescribed a detailed workout regimen which the pitcher would continue to utilize as his career advanced. He was originally drafted by the New York Yankees in the first round of the 1998 amateur draft and offered an approximately $1.5 million signing bonus, but the parties were unable to agree on a contract after negotiating all summer, and Prior chose to attend college instead, pursuing a business degree while playing college baseball.

As a freshman, Prior went to Vanderbilt. Tim Corbin later compared him to David Price and Kris Benson. He then transferred to the University of Southern California (USC), posting a 10–7 record his sophomore year and leading the USC Trojans to the 2000 College World Series. USC posted a 16–game winning streak before Prior helped USC reach the College World Series again in 2001, posting a 15–1 record and a 1.69 earned run average (ERA), striking out 202 in innings while walking just 18. He won several awards that year, including the Dick Howser Trophy, the Golden Spikes Award, and the Rotary Smith Award.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Cubs===
In 2001, Prior re-entered the draft and was considered &quot;the consensus top player&quot;, according to ESPN. He was taken second overall by the Chicago Cubs, behind Joe Mauer, who was drafted by the Minnesota Twins. The Cubs signed Prior to a contract for $10.5 million, the highest signing bonus for a draft pick until the Washington Nationals gave Stephen Strasburg $15 million in 2009.

After nine starts in the minors, Prior was called up to the big leagues in 2002 as a 21-year-old. He made his Major League debut on May 22 at Wrigley Field against the Pittsburgh Pirates and became one of 14 Cub pitchers since 1920 to win his first major league start by striking out 10 batters over six innings pitched in a 7–4 victory. Teammate Sammy Sosa said, &quot;I was impressed with what he did today. Going out there in front of 40,000 people and throwing the way he did, that was a good sign.&quot; On June 7, he threw 128 pitches and struck out 11 while allowing no runs in a 2–0 win over the Seattle Mariners. He threw his first career complete game on August 4, striking out 13, allowing one run, and throwing 136 pitches in a 4–1 win over the Colorado Rockies. &quot;I was kind of surprised that they did send me out there,&quot; he said, when he found out he was pitching the ninth. On August 15, he struck out seven hitters in a row, tying the Cubs&#x27; record shared by Jamie Moyer and Kerry Wood. In total, he struck out 12 in six innings, earning a no decision in an eventual 6–4 win. During a game against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 31, he was removed because of a strained left hamstring. Two days later, the Cubs announced they were shutting him down for the rest of the year because of the injury. Prior finished his rookie campaign with a 6–6 record with a 3.32 ERA, and 147 strikeouts in innings pitched. &quot;The Sporting News&quot; called his rookie season &quot;stellar&quot;, and he finished seventh in National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award voting.

In his second start of the 2003 season, Prior pitched his first career shutout, striking out 12 and allowing four hits in a 3–0 win over the Montreal Expos. In six innings on May 12, he allowed four runs to the Milwaukee Brewers but struck out 11 and earned the victory in an 11–5 triumph. He struck out 16 Brewers on June 26, allowing two runs in eight innings but getting a no decision in a 5–3 loss. In the second inning of a game against the Atlanta Braves on July 11, Prior had to exit after suffering a violent on-field collision with Atlanta second baseman Marcus Giles. The injury forced him to the disabled list (DL) with shoulder stiffness. Selected as National League All-Stars in 2003, both Prior and fellow right-handed pitcher Kerry Wood were dubbed &quot;Chicago Heat&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Sportswriter George Vecsey compared them to other famed rotation twosomes, like Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette, or Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling. According to CBS Local, sportswriters and fans criticized Cubs manager Dusty Baker on the high pitch counts of the two aces. Prior averaged 113.4 pitches per starts in the regular season, that number rising to 126.1 in September and 122.7 in the playoffs. However, the contributions of the two aces helped lead the Cubs to an 88-win season and an NL Central division title.

Against his hometown San Diego Padres on August 5, Prior returned from the DL, allowing two hits and no runs in six inning and earning the victory in a 3–0 win. After his return, he compiled a 10–1 record, striking out 13, 14, and 10 in his final three starts of the season. On September 27, he gave up two runs and struck out 10 in innings, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates for the win in Game 1 of a doubleheader. That win brought the Cubs&#x27; magic number to one for the division title, and they won the second game to win the division for the first time since 1989. Tied for the second most wins as a NL pitcher with Woody Williams in 2003, Prior finished third in NL Cy Young Award voting after compiling an 18–6 win–loss record. His 2.43 ERA was third in the NL (behind Jason Schmidt&#x27;s 2.34 and Kevin Brown&#x27;s 2.39), his 245 strikeouts were topped only by Wood&#x27;s 266, and his .750 winning percentage was tied with three others for second in the NL behind Schmidt&#x27;s .773.

In the NL Division Series, the Cubs faced Atlanta, and Prior started Game 3 against former Cub Greg Maddux. Prior allowed two hits and one run, throwing a complete game and striking out seven as the Cubs won 3–1. With a five-game series win over the Braves, the Cubs faced the Florida Marlins in the NL Championship Series. Prior pitched into the eighth inning in Game 2, allowing three runs (two earned) and striking out five in a 12–3 victory, before taking the mound again in Game 6. For seven innings, he threw scoreless ball, allowing just three hits as the Cubs took a 3–0 lead. When Mike Mordecai flew out against him to start the eighth, the Cubs were five outs away from playing in their first World Series since 1945. Then, Juan Pierre hit a double, bringing up Luis Castillo, who hit a foul ball down the left field line that outfielder Moisés Alou gave chase to. The ball came down at the edge of the stands, and Steve Bartman, a fan, reached for it, preventing Alou from making the catch. Castillo went on to walk, and Prior and the Cubs never recovered from the incident. Prior struggled with his command and gave up the lead with the aid of poor defensive play, most notably a booted ground ball by shortstop Alex Gonzalez that might have resulted in a double play. After Derrek Lee hit an RBI double off him that tied the game and put runners at second and third, Prior was removed from the game and replaced with Kyle Farnsworth. The Marlins went on to score eight runs that inning, and Prior was charged with the loss in the 8–3 defeat. The Cubs went on to lose Game 7, and their 94-year-long World Series drought continued.

Prior was forced to miss the first two months of the 2004 season due to an achilles tendon injury and elbow soreness. In his return on June 4, he struck out eight Pirates, allowing two hits and no runs in six innings, though the Cubs lost 2–1. His ERA went up to 5.05 after he gave up seven runs over three innings in an 8–6 loss to San Diego on August 10, and Ramon Hernandez of the Padres noticed a difference. &quot;When I faced Prior the first time in my life he was throwing 96, 97. Today he was throwing 91-94 and he was a little wild and out of the zone. He was hurt for a long time. It might take a little bit of time for him to be the Prior that everybody has seen.&quot; Prior posted a 3.06 ERA after that, and in his last three games of the season, he allowed just two runs in innings. He tied a career-high by striking out 16 Cincinnati Reds over nine innings in his &quot;best game of the season&quot; according to ESPN, though the Cubs went on to lose 2–1 in the 12th inning. Prior finished 2004 with a 6–4 record and a 4.02 ERA in 21 starts, striking out 139 in innings.

Elbow inflammation caused Prior to start the 2005 season on the disabled list, though he was activated on April 12. He won his first three starts and posted a 2.93 ERA through May 27. However, against the Rockies that day, Prior was hit on his right (pitching) elbow by a 117-mph comeback line drive off the bat of Brad Hawpe, giving him a compression fracture. This sent him to another stint on the DL. Coincidentally, Hawpe had hit a three-run home run off Prior in the 2000 College World Series while playing for the Louisiana State University Tigers.

Returning from the DL on June 26, Prior limited the Chicago White Sox to one hit in six innings, earning the win in a 2–0 triumph. He remained in the team&#x27;s rotation the rest of the year, not having to miss time with any other injuries. Against the Pirates on July 14, he allowed two hits and one unearned run in eight innings, earning the win in a 5–1 victory. Prior finished the 2005 season with an 11–7 record in 27 starts, striking out 188 in innings. His 188 strikeouts were the ninth-most in the NL, despite his time missed due to injury.
During the 2005 off-season, after Nomar Garciaparra left the Cubs via free agency, Prior was mentioned by Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports as part of a possible deal for Baltimore Orioles&#x27;s shortstop Miguel Tejada, but this trade did not come to pass. As in 2005, Prior started the 2006 season on the disabled list. This time, though, it was because of a strained right shoulder, and the injury caused him to miss the first two months of the 2006 season. His debut came on June 18, when he had what ESPN called &quot;one of the worst outings of his career&quot; against the Detroit Tigers, giving up six runs in the first inning and lasting just innings before being pulled. Prior was 0–4 in four starts with a 7.71 ERA, until he was once again put on the disabled list on July 14, after straining his left oblique muscle while taking batting practice on July 8. Since he had not pitched since July 4, he was eligible to return on July 21 against the Nationals. He pitched only innings before he was pulled out of the game, allowing four runs and taking a no decision in an eventual 7–6 loss. Against the Brewers on August 10, Prior&#x27;s pitch speed slowed in the third inning of his start. He was replaced by Juan Mateo in the fourth inning, having allowed six runs (five earned) in an eventual 8–6 defeat. Two days later, he was placed on the disabled list (tendinitis) for the third time that season, missing the remainder of the year. He finished the 2006 season with a 1–6 record and a 7.22 ERA in nine starts, striking out 38 against 28 walks in innings.

Eligible for arbitration, Prior asked for a pay raise from his 2006 salary of $3.65 million to $3.875 million for 2007. The Cubs avoided arbitration with Prior when he settled for a one-year $3.575 million contract for 2007. Prior found himself competing with Wade Miller to be the Cubs&#x27; fifth starter in 2007, and he was optioned to the minor leagues before the season began. After one start in the minors, in which he gave up three runs and got the win, Prior received exploratory surgery on his right shoulder by James Andrews, a noted orthopedic surgeon; the procedure showed evidence of vast structural damage. There were tears in Prior&#x27;s labrum, anterior capsule, and rotator cuff. As a result, Prior missed the rest of the 2007 season. Cubs general manager (GM) Jim Hendry said that anything provided by Prior or Wood would be &quot;gravy&quot; and he hoped that this would come to fruition. The Associated Press reported that the injury was not expected to be career-ending. Prior was non-tendered on December 12, 2007, ending his tenure with the Cubs.

===Other organizations, comeback attempts===
====San Diego Padres (2008-09)====
On December 26, 2007, Prior agreed to a $1 million, one-year, incentive-laden contract with the San Diego Padres. Prior had hoped to pitch again by May or June of the 2008 season, but another tear of his right anterior capsule during his rehab in May 2008 required surgery on June 4 that forced him to miss his second consecutive season. On January 13, 2009, Prior agreed to another one-year contract with the Padres, this one a minor league deal, which included a $1 million option if Prior pitched in the major leagues in 2009. He was released from his contract on August 1, 2009, after the team was disappointed by a lack of progress in his rehab.

====Orange County Flyers (independent), Texas Rangers (2010)====
By November 2009, throwing a ball 30 feet resulted in pain for Prior. That month, he hired Jackson Crowther, a former minor league pitcher who had also attended USC, to help him with his rehab. They focused on trying to grow muscle groups in the shoulder region, in hopes of helping stabilize the joint. On June 30, 2010, Prior returned to USC to perform a workout for major league scouts, but the workout was judged as &quot;just all right&quot; by an unnamed veteran scout.

Unable to sign with a major league team, Prior agreed to an independent league contract with the Orange County Flyers of the Golden Baseball League on August 3, 2010. Used out of the bullpen for the team, he posted an 0.82 ERA in nine games, striking out 22 hitters in 11 innings. On September 3, he signed with the Texas Rangers on a minor league contract. He pitched one scoreless inning for their Triple-A affiliate, the Oklahoma City RedHawks.

====New York Yankees (2011)====

Prior signed a one-year minor league contract with the New York Yankees for the 2011 season, though he was an unlikely candidate to make the Yankees&#x27; roster because their only projected vacancy was for a long reliever. Prior was assigned to start the year with the Single-A advanced Tampa Yankees in Florida rather than joining the colder weather Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees in order to work on his transition to a relief pitcher. After just four games, he was promoted to Scranton on April 20 but promptly placed on the disabled list with a groin injury. Ultimately, Prior would make 11 appearances in the minor leagues for the Yankees, only one of which was at Triple-A. He was granted free agency on November 2, 2011.

====Boston Red Sox (2012)====
Unsigned to begin the 2012 season, Prior secured a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox on May 2 and pitched in their extended spring training program. Later joining the Pawtucket Red Sox, he provided the Triple-A team with &quot;stellar&quot; pitching, according to Teddy Mitrosilis of ESPN, though he was walking too many hitters. In 19 games for Pawtucket (all in relief), Prior had a 1–0 record, a 3.96 ERA, and 38 strikeouts in 25 innings, though he walked 23. He was released by the Red Sox on August 17 in order to make room for a newly acquired prospect on the roster.

====Cincinnati Reds (2013)====
In February 2013, Prior called Baker, now manager of the Reds, to see if Cincinnati was interested in signing him. The Reds gave him a physical, and when he passed, they signed him to a minor league contract on March 1, 2013. He made seven appearances for the Triple-A Louisville Bats but was placed on the disabled list in April with a shoulder injury. On June 28, the Reds released Prior. He announced his retirement from baseball in December.

==Pitching style==

In his prime, Prior&#x27;s repertoire of pitches included a mid-90s mph fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. The fastball reached speeds of up to 97 miles per hour, at its fastest, while the curve featured a sharp, downward break, travelling about 10 miles per hour slower. Teammate Kerry Wood praised his fearlessness and control: &quot;&quot;He&#x27;s not worried about throwing an inside fastball to a Jeff Bagwell with men on second and third...If that&#x27;s the pitch he needs to make, he&#x27;ll make it.&quot; Damian Miller, his catcher with the Cubs in 2003, compared him to Curt Schilling, noting that both pitchers threw a lot of high fastballs. Daniel Habib of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; called him &quot;fundamentally sound&quot;, also praising his &quot;sophisticated approach&quot; to hitters.

Early in Prior&#x27;s career, his pitching mechanics were touted as &quot;perfect&quot;, according to &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. House tried to help him develop a mechanically efficient and sound delivery. Sports reporter Buster Olney called his mechanics &quot;smooth, fluid, consistent,&quot; opining that his delivery made him less of an injury-risk than teammate Wood. House said that same year, &quot;He&#x27;s up there with Nolan Ryan...he has better mechanics than Roger Clemens, if only by percentage points. He has Greg Maddux mechanics with a Kerry Wood/Nolan Ryan type of arm. He&#x27;s going to, with maturity, get bigger and stronger, too. It&#x27;s a gene-pool thing.&quot; House also labelled Prior a &quot;can&#x27;t-miss&quot; prospect.

However, after Prior&#x27;s rash of injuries, people reexamined his delivery. His throwing motion drew criticism from &quot;armchair biomechanists&quot;, according to &quot;Yahoo.com&quot;. Chris O&#x27;Leary speculated that some of the trouble was due to Prior&#x27;s &quot;Inverted W&quot; arm action, in which he lifted his elbows above and behind the level of his shoulders, with the forearm pointing down. According to O&#x27;Leary, this created a timing problem that placed an undue stress on the muscles and ligaments of the shoulder and elbow because the arm got up to the &quot;cocked position&quot; too late. Similarly, Dick Mills, a former major league pitcher and co-author of &quot;The Science and Art of Baseball Pitching&quot; and Pitching.com, speculated that Prior&#x27;s injuries were a result of scapular loading, a movement in which a pitcher&#x27;s shoulder blades are pinched together and elbows are taken behind, and sometimes above, their shoulders.

On the other hand, Ryan Fagan of &quot;The Sporting News&quot; speculated that Prior&#x27;s injuries may have been the result of manager Dusty Baker overusing him in his early career, also pointing to his shoulder injury after running into Giles as a potential source of the trouble. Critics made Baker their &quot;scapegoat&quot;, according to Jason Buckland of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, blaming him for overusing his young pitcher. Prior himself speculated that the Giles injury and Hawpe&#x27;s line drive were big factors. He said &quot;I don&#x27;t blame Dusty for what happened to me,&quot; observing that Baker had to balance how often to use the pitchers with making decisions that would help the Cubs win.

==Coaching career==
After his playing career ended, Prior accepted a front office position with the Padres in 2013 as an assistant in the team&#x27;s baseball operations department, in a capacity designed to acquaint him with how a baseball front office worked. In 2015, he became San Diego&#x27;s minor league pitching coordinator, serving in that capacity for three seasons. He was then hired by the Los Angeles Dodgers as their bullpen coach for the 2018 season. MLB columnist Tim Brown speculated that the Dodgers might groom Prior to take over as their pitching coach when Rick Honeycutt eventually retired. Sure enough, after Honeycutt was reassigned in 2020, the Dodgers made Prior their pitching coach.

==Personal life==
Prior married Heather Gora on November 15, 2003. The couple have three children: Amanda, Caitlin, and Matthew. After becoming a professional baseball player, Prior continued his education on a part-time basis and received a business degree from the USC Marshall School of Business in 2004.

<text>Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, by which a physical system in a symmetric state spontaneously ends up in an asymmetric state. In particular, it can describe systems where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy vacuum solutions do not exhibit that same symmetry. When the system goes to one of those vacuum solutions, the symmetry is broken for perturbations around that vacuum even though the entire Lagrangian retains that symmetry.

==Overview==

The spontaneous symmetry breaking cannot happen in quantum mechanics that describes finite dimensional systems, due to Stone-von Neumann theorem (that states the uniqueness of Heisenberg commutation relations in finite dimensions). So spontaneous symmetry breaking can be observed only in infinite dimensional theories, as quantum field theories.

By definition, spontaneous symmetry breaking requires the existence of physical laws which are invariant under a symmetry transformation (such as translation or rotation), so that any pair of outcomes differing only by that transformation have the same probability distribution. For example if measurements of an observable at any two different positions have the same probability distribution, the observable has translational symmetry.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when this relation breaks down, while the underlying physical laws remain symmetrical.

Conversely, in explicit symmetry breaking, if two outcomes are considered, the probability distributions of a pair of outcomes can be different. For example in an electric field, the forces on a charged particle are different in different directions, so the rotational symmetry is explicitly broken by the electric field which does not have this symmetry.

Phases of matter, such as crystals, magnets, and conventional superconductors, as well as simple phase transitions can be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Notable exceptions include topological phases of matter like the fractional quantum Hall effect.

Typically, when spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, the observable properties of the system change in multiple ways. For example the density, compressibility, coefficient of thermal expansion, and specific heat will be expected to change when a liquid becomes a solid.

==Examples==

=== Sombrero potential ===

Consider a symmetric upward dome with a trough circling the bottom. If a ball is put at the very peak of the dome, the system is symmetric with respect to a rotation around the center axis. But the ball may &quot;spontaneously break&quot; this symmetry by rolling down the dome into the trough, a point of lowest energy. Afterward, the ball has come to a rest at some fixed point on the perimeter. The dome and the ball retain their individual symmetry, but the system does not.
In the simplest idealized relativistic model, the spontaneously broken symmetry is summarized through an illustrative scalar field theory. The relevant Lagrangian of a scalar field formula_1, which essentially dictates how a system behaves, can be split up into kinetic and potential terms,
It is in this potential term formula_2 that the symmetry breaking is triggered. An example of a potential, due to Jeffrey Goldstone is illustrated in the graph at the left.
This potential has an infinite number of possible minima (vacuum states) given by

for any real &quot;θ&quot; between 0 and 2&quot;π&quot;. The system also has an unstable vacuum state corresponding to . This state has a U(1) symmetry. However, once the system falls into a specific stable vacuum state (amounting to a choice of &quot;θ&quot;), this symmetry will appear to be lost, or &quot;spontaneously broken&quot;.

In fact, any other choice of &quot;θ&quot; would have exactly the same energy, and the defining equations respect the symmetry but the ground state (vacuum) of the theory breaks the symmetry, implying the existence of a massless Nambu–Goldstone boson, the mode running around the circle at the minimum of this potential, and indicating there is some memory of the original symmetry in the Lagrangian.

===Other examples===
* For ferromagnetic materials, the underlying laws are invariant under spatial rotations. Here, the order parameter is the magnetization, which measures the magnetic dipole density. Above the Curie temperature, the order parameter is zero, which is spatially invariant, and there is no symmetry breaking. Below the Curie temperature, however, the magnetization acquires a constant nonvanishing value, which points in a certain direction (in the idealized situation where we have full equilibrium; otherwise, translational symmetry gets broken as well). The residual rotational symmetries which leave the orientation of this vector invariant remain unbroken, unlike the other rotations which do not and are thus spontaneously broken.
* The laws describing a solid are invariant under the full Euclidean group, but the solid itself spontaneously breaks this group down to a space group. The displacement and the orientation are the order parameters.
* General relativity has a Lorentz symmetry, but in FRW cosmological models, the mean 4-velocity field defined by averaging over the velocities of the galaxies (the galaxies act like gas particles at cosmological scales) acts as an order parameter breaking this symmetry. Similar comments can be made about the cosmic microwave background.
* For the electroweak model, as explained earlier, a component of the Higgs field provides the order parameter breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry to the electromagnetic gauge symmetry. Like the ferromagnetic example, there is a phase transition at the electroweak temperature. The same comment about us not tending to notice broken symmetries suggests why it took so long for us to discover electroweak unification.
* In superconductors, there is a condensed-matter collective field ψ, which acts as the order parameter breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.
* Take a thin cylindrical plastic rod and push both ends together. Before buckling, the system is symmetric under rotation, and so visibly cylindrically symmetric. But after buckling, it looks different, and asymmetric. Nevertheless, features of the cylindrical symmetry are still there: ignoring friction, it would take no force to freely spin the rod around, displacing the ground state in time, and amounting to an oscillation of vanishing frequency, unlike the radial oscillations in the direction of the buckle. This spinning mode is effectively the requisite Nambu–Goldstone boson.
* Consider a uniform layer of fluid over an infinite horizontal plane. This system has all the symmetries of the Euclidean plane. But now heat the bottom surface uniformly so that it becomes much hotter than the upper surface. When the temperature gradient becomes large enough, convection cells will form, breaking the Euclidean symmetry.
* Consider a bead on a circular hoop that is rotated about a vertical diameter. As the rotational velocity is increased gradually from rest, the bead will initially stay at its initial equilibrium point at the bottom of the hoop (intuitively stable, lowest gravitational potential). At a certain critical rotational velocity, this point will become unstable and the bead will jump to one of two other newly created equilibria, equidistant from the center. Initially, the system is symmetric with respect to the diameter, yet after passing the critical velocity, the bead ends up in one of the two new equilibrium points, thus breaking the symmetry.
* The two-balloon experiment is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking when both balloons are initially inflated to the local maximum pressure. When some air flows from one balloon into the other, the pressure in both balloons will drop, making the system more stable in the asymmetric state.

== In particle physics ==
In particle physics, the force carrier particles are normally specified by field equations with gauge symmetry; their equations predict that certain measurements will be the same at any point in the field. For instance, field equations might predict that the mass of two quarks is constant. Solving the equations to find the mass of each quark might give two solutions. In one solution, quark A is heavier than quark B. In the second solution, quark B is heavier than quark A &quot;by the same amount&quot;. The symmetry of the equations is not reflected by the individual solutions, but it is reflected by the range of solutions.

An actual measurement reflects only one solution, representing a breakdown in the symmetry of the underlying theory. &quot;Hidden&quot; is a better term than &quot;broken&quot;, because the symmetry is always there in these equations. This phenomenon is called &quot;spontaneous&quot; symmetry breaking (SSB) because &quot;nothing&quot; (that we know of) breaks the symmetry in the equations. By the nature of spontaneous symmetry breaking, different portions of the early Universe would break symmetry in different directions, leading to topological defects, such as two-dimensional domain walls, one-dimensional cosmic strings, zero-dimensional monopoles, and/or textures, depending on the relevant homotopy group and the dynamics of the theory. For example, Higgs symmetry breaking may have created primordial cosmic strings as a byproduct. Hypothetical GUT symmetry-breaking generically produces monopoles, creating difficulties for GUT unless monopoles (along with any GUT domain walls) are expelled from our observable Universe through cosmic inflation.

=== Chiral symmetry ===

Chiral symmetry breaking is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking affecting the chiral symmetry of the strong interactions in particle physics. It is a property of quantum chromodynamics, the quantum field theory describing these interactions, and is responsible for the bulk of the mass (over 99%) of the nucleons, and thus of all common matter, as it converts very light bound quarks into 100 times heavier constituents of baryons. The approximate Nambu–Goldstone bosons in this spontaneous symmetry breaking process are the pions, whose mass is an order of magnitude lighter than the mass of the nucleons. It served as the prototype and significant ingredient of the Higgs mechanism underlying the electroweak symmetry breaking.

=== Higgs mechanism ===
The strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces can all be understood as arising from gauge symmetries, which is a redundancy in the description of the symmetry. The Higgs mechanism, the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge symmetries, is an important component in understanding the superconductivity of metals and the origin of particle masses in the standard model of particle physics. 
The term &quot;spontaneous symmetry breaking&quot; is a misnomer here as Elitzur&#x27;s theorem states that local gauge symmetries can never be spontaneously broken. Rather, after gauge fixing, the global symmetry (or redundancy) can be broken in a manner formally resembling spontaneous symmetry breaking. 
One important consequence of the distinction between true symmetries and &quot;gauge symmetries&quot;, is that the massless Nambu–Goldstone resulting from spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry are absorbed in the description of the gauge vector field, providing massive vector field modes, like the plasma mode in a superconductor, or the Higgs mode observed in particle physics.

In the standard model of particle physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gauge symmetry associated with the electro-weak force generates masses for several particles, and separates the electromagnetic and weak forces. The W and Z bosons are the elementary particles that mediate the weak interaction, while the photon mediates the electromagnetic interaction. At energies much greater than 100 GeV, all these particles behave in a similar manner. The Weinberg–Salam theory predicts that, at lower energies, this symmetry is broken so that the photon and the massive W and Z bosons emerge. In addition, fermions develop mass consistently.

Without spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions requires the existence of a number of particles. However, some particles (the W and Z bosons) would then be predicted to be massless, when, in reality, they are observed to have mass. To overcome this, spontaneous symmetry breaking is augmented by the Higgs mechanism to give these particles mass. It also suggests the presence of a new particle, the Higgs boson, detected in 2012.

Superconductivity of metals is a condensed-matter analog of the Higgs phenomena, in which a condensate of Cooper pairs of electrons spontaneously breaks the U(1) gauge symmetry associated with light and electromagnetism.

=== Dynamical symmetry breaking ===
Dynamical symmetry breaking (DSB) is a special form of spontaneous symmetry breaking in which the ground state of the system has reduced symmetry properties compared to its theoretical description (i.e., Lagrangian).

Dynamical breaking of a global symmetry is a spontaneous symmetry breaking, which happens not at the (classical) tree level (i.e., at the level of the bare action), but due to quantum corrections (i.e., at the level of the effective action).

Dynamical breaking of a gauge symmetry is subtler. In conventional spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, there exists an unstable Higgs particle in the theory, which drives the vacuum to a symmetry-broken phase (i.e, electroweak interactions.) In dynamical gauge symmetry breaking, however, no unstable Higgs particle operates in the theory, but the bound states of the system itself provide the unstable fields that render the phase transition. For example, Bardeen, Hill, and Lindner published a paper that attempts to replace the conventional Higgs mechanism in the standard model by a DSB that is driven by a bound state of top-antitop quarks. (Such models, in which a composite particle plays the role of the Higgs boson, are often referred to as &quot;Composite Higgs models&quot;.) Dynamical breaking of gauge symmetries is often due to creation of a fermionic condensate — e.g., the quark condensate, which is connected to the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Conventional superconductivity is the paradigmatic example from the condensed matter side, where phonon-mediated attractions lead electrons to become bound in pairs and then condense, thereby breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.

==In condensed matter physics==
Most phases of matter can be understood through the lens of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, crystals are periodic arrays of atoms that are not invariant under all translations (only under a small subset of translations by a lattice vector). Magnets have north and south poles that are oriented in a specific direction, breaking rotational symmetry. In addition to these examples, there are a whole host of other symmetry-breaking phases of matter — including nematic phases of liquid crystals, charge- and spin-density waves, superfluids, and many others.

There are several known examples of matter that cannot be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking, including: topologically ordered phases of matter, such as fractional quantum Hall liquids, and spin-liquids. These states do not break any symmetry, but are distinct phases of matter. Unlike the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, there is not a general framework for describing such states.

=== Continuous symmetry ===
The ferromagnet is the canonical system that spontaneously breaks the continuous symmetry of the spins below the Curie temperature and at , where &quot;h&quot; is the external magnetic field. Below the Curie temperature, the energy of the system is invariant under inversion of the magnetization &quot;m&quot;(x) such that . The symmetry is spontaneously broken as when the Hamiltonian becomes invariant under the inversion transformation, but the expectation value is not invariant.

Spontaneously-symmetry-broken phases of matter are characterized by an order parameter that describes the quantity which breaks the symmetry under consideration. For example, in a magnet, the order parameter is the local magnetization.

Spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry is inevitably accompanied by gapless (meaning that these modes do not cost any energy to excite) Nambu–Goldstone modes associated with slow, long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. For example, vibrational modes in a crystal, known as phonons, are associated with slow density fluctuations of the crystal&#x27;s atoms. The associated Goldstone mode for magnets are oscillating waves of spin known as spin-waves. For symmetry-breaking states, whose order parameter is not a conserved quantity, Nambu–Goldstone modes are typically massless and propagate at a constant velocity.

An important theorem, due to Mermin and Wagner, states that, at finite temperature, thermally activated fluctuations of Nambu–Goldstone modes destroy the long-range order, and prevent spontaneous symmetry breaking in one- and two-dimensional systems. Similarly, quantum fluctuations of the order parameter prevent most types of continuous symmetry breaking in one-dimensional systems even at zero temperature. (An important exception is ferromagnets, whose order parameter, magnetization, is an exactly conserved quantity and does not have any quantum fluctuations.)

Other long-range interacting systems, such as cylindrical curved surfaces interacting via the Coulomb potential or Yukawa potential, have been shown to break translational and rotational symmetries. It was shown, in the presence of a symmetric Hamiltonian, and in the limit of infinite volume, the system spontaneously adopts a chiral configuration — i.e., breaks mirror plane symmetry.

== Generalisation and technical usage ==
For spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur, there must be a system in which there are several equally likely outcomes. The system as a whole is therefore symmetric with respect to these outcomes. However, if the system is sampled (i.e. if the system is actually used or interacted with in any way), a specific outcome must occur. Though the system as a whole is symmetric, it is never encountered with this symmetry, but only in one specific asymmetric state. Hence, the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken in that theory. Nevertheless, the fact that each outcome is equally likely is a reflection of the underlying symmetry, which is thus often dubbed &quot;hidden symmetry&quot;, and has crucial formal consequences. (See the article on the Goldstone boson.)

When a theory is symmetric with respect to a symmetry group, but requires that one element of the group be distinct, then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. The theory must not dictate &quot;which&quot; member is distinct, only that &quot;one is&quot;. From this point on, the theory can be treated as if this element actually is distinct, with the proviso that any results found in this way must be resymmetrized, by taking the average of each of the elements of the group being the distinct one.

The crucial concept in physics theories is the order parameter. If there is a field (often a background field) which acquires an expectation value (not necessarily a &quot;vacuum&quot; expectation value) which is not invariant under the symmetry in question, we say that the system is in the ordered phase, and the symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is because other subsystems interact with the order parameter, which specifies a &quot;frame of reference&quot; to be measured against. In that case, the vacuum state does not obey the initial symmetry (which would keep it invariant, in the linearly realized Wigner mode in which it would be a singlet), and, instead changes under the (hidden) symmetry, now implemented in the (nonlinear) Nambu–Goldstone mode. Normally, in the absence of the Higgs mechanism, massless Goldstone bosons arise.

The symmetry group can be discrete, such as the space group of a crystal, or continuous (e.g., a Lie group), such as the rotational symmetry of space. However, if the system contains only a single spatial dimension, then only discrete symmetries may be broken in a vacuum state of the full quantum theory, although a classical solution may break a continuous symmetry.

==Nobel Prize==
On October 7, 2008, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics to three scientists for their work in subatomic physics symmetry breaking. Yoichiro Nambu, of the University of Chicago, won half of the prize for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in the context of the strong interactions, specifically chiral symmetry breaking. Physicists Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa, of Kyoto University, shared the other half of the prize for discovering the origin of the explicit breaking of CP symmetry in the weak interactions. This origin is ultimately reliant on the Higgs mechanism, but, so far understood as a &quot;just so&quot; feature of Higgs couplings, not a spontaneously broken symmetry phenomenon.

<doc id="297470" wikidata="Q3172556" url="?curid=297470" title="John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter">
<text>John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon (29 March 1395 – 5 August 1447) was an English nobleman and military commander during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. His father, the 1st Duke of Exeter, was a maternal half-brother to Richard II of England, and was executed after King Richard&#x27;s deposition. The Holland family estates and titles were forfeited, but John was able to recover them by dedicating his career to royal service. Earl of Huntingdon, of the Castle, town, manor of Barnstable and manors of Dartington, Fremington, South Molton, Torrington, Devon, Stevington, Bedfordshire, Ardington, Berkshire, Haslebury, Blagdon and Somerset. Holland rendered great assistance to his cousin Henry V in his conquest of France, fighting both on land and on the sea. He was marshal and admiral of England and governor of Aquitaine under Henry VI.

==Origins==
He was the second son of John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter, by his wife Elizabeth of Lancaster. His paternal grandparents were Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent, and Joan of Kent (a granddaughter of King Edward I), who after Holland&#x27;s death had married Edward, the Black Prince. His father was a half-brother of King Richard II of England, and through his mother he was nephew of Henry IV of England, a first cousin of Henry V of England, and a first cousin once removed of Henry VI of England.

==Career==
Holland was just a boy when his father conspired against Henry IV and was attainted and executed. Nevertheless, he was given a chance to serve Henry V in the 1415 campaign in France, where he distinguished himself at Agincourt. The next year Holland was restored in blood and to his father&#x27;s earldom of Huntingdon, and was made a Knight of the Garter. (His older brother Richard had died in 1400.) Over the next five years he held various important commands with the English forces in France and in 1420 was made Constable of the Tower of London. He was captured by the French in 1421 at the Battle of Baugé and spent four years in captivity, not being released until 1425.

==Marriages and issue==
He married three times:
*Firstly, on 6 March 1427 to Lady Anne Stafford (d. 20 or 24 September 1432), widow of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, and daughter of Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford. By Anne he had two children:
**Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter (1430–1475).
**Lady Anne Holland (d. 26 December 1486), who married, firstly, Sir John Neville (d. before 16 March 1450), son of her second cousin Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland. The marriage is said to have been unconsummated. She was married, secondly, to her second cousin, John Neville, Baron Neville (uncle of her first husband), slain at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461. She married, thirdly, James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas.
*Secondly, on 20 January 1433, he married Beatrice of Portugal; 
*Thirdly, he married Lady Anne Montagu (d. 28 November 1457), a daughter of John Montacute, 3rd Earl of Salisbury.

==Mistresses==
By an unnamed mistress or mistresses he also had several illegitimate children, two of whom he named in his will. William, Thomas and Robert, the so-called &quot;Bastards of Exeter&quot;, were active in the Lancastrian struggles, and Stow reported that two of them were among the notable dead at the Battle of Towton.

==Appointments==
In July 1416 he was appointed Lieutenant General to High Admiral of England Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter (the post later became known as Lieutenant of the Admiralty) until 1435. In November 1432 he was made Deputy Marshall of England until September 1436. In 1435 he was appointed High Admiral of England, Ireland and Aquitaine. In March 1438 Holand was appointed Commander of the Army for relieving the castle of Guînes. In 1439 he was made the king&#x27;s lieutenant in Aquitaine. He was made count of Ivry in France by John, Duke of Bedford. Holland recovered his father&#x27;s dukedom of Exeter on 6 January 1443/1444, and was given precedence just below the Duke of York. He was succeeded as duke by his son Henry.

==Death and burial==
There is an effigy of this John Holland in the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London. It had originally been in St Katharine by the Tower.

<text>In Welsh culture, an eisteddfod is an institution and festival with several ranked competitions, including in poetry and music.
The term &quot;eisteddfod&quot;, which is formed from the Welsh morphemes: , meaning &#x27;sit&#x27;, and , meaning &#x27;be&#x27;, means, according to Hywel Teifi Edwards, &quot;sitting-together.&quot; Edwards further defines the earliest form of the eisteddfod as a competitive meeting between bards and minstrels, in which the winner was chosen by a noble or royal patron.

The first documented instance of such a literary festival and competition took place under the patronage of Prince Rhys ap Gruffudd of the House of Dinefwr at Cardigan Castle in 1176. However, with the Edwardian Conquest of Wales, the closing of the bardic schools, and the Anglicization of the Welsh nobility, it fell into abeyance. The current format owes much to an 18th-century revival, first patronized and overseen by the London-based Gwyneddigion Society. It was later co-opted by the &quot;Gorsedd Cymru&quot;, a secret society of poets, writers, and musicians founded by Iolo Morganwg, whose beliefs were &quot;a compound of Christianity and Druidism, Philosophy and Mysticism.&quot;

Despite the Druidic influences and the demonstrably fictitious nature of Iolo Morganwg&#x27;s doctrines, rituals, and ceremonies, both the Gorsedd and the eisteddfod revival were embraced and spread widely by Anglican and nonconformist clergy. The revival therefore proved enormously successful and is credited as one of the primary reasons for the continued survival of the Welsh language, Welsh literature, and Welsh culture after more than eight centuries of colonialism.

During his two 20th-century terms as Archdruid of the &quot;Gorsedd Cymru&quot;, Albert Evans-Jones, whose bardic name was Cynan and who was a war poet and minister of the Presbyterian Church of Wales, created new rituals for both the Gorsedd and the eisteddfod which are based upon the Christian beliefs of the Welsh people rather than upon Modern Druidry. After watching the initiation of Rowan Williams into the Gorsedd at the 2002 National Eisteddfod, Marcus Tanner wrote that the rituals &quot;seemed culled from the pages of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.&quot;

Since its 18th-century revival, the eisteddfod tradition has been carried all over the world by the Welsh diaspora. Today&#x27;s (plural form) and the National Eisteddfod of Wales in particular, are in equal parts a Renaissance fair, a Celtic festival, a musical festival, a literary festival, and &quot;the supreme exhibition of the Welsh culture.&quot;

In some other countries, the term eisteddfod is used for performing arts competitions that have nothing to do with Welsh culture or the Welsh language. In other cases, however, the eisteddfod tradition has been adapted into other cultures as part of the ongoing fight to preserve endangered languages such as Irish, Cornish, Breton, Scottish Gaelic, Canadian Gaelic, Manx, Guernésiais, and Jèrriais.

==Events==

===Proclamation===
As decreed by Iolo Morganwg during the late 18th century, each eisteddfod is proclaimed a year and a day prior to its opening day, by a herald from the &quot;Gorsedd Cymru&quot;.

The proclamation is to read as follows, &quot;When the year of Our Lord ----, and the period of the Gorsedd of the Bards of Britain within the summer solstice, after summons and invitation to all to all of Wales through the Gorsedd Trumpet, under warning of a year and a day, in sight and hearing of lords and commons and in the face of the sun, the eye of light, be it known that a Gorsedd and Eisteddfod will be held at the town of ----, where protections will be afforded to all who seek privilege, dignity, and license in Poetry and Minstrelsy... And thither shall come the Archdruid and the Gorsedd and others, Bards and Licensiates of the Privilege and Robe of the Bards of the Isle of Britain, there to hold judgment of Chair and Gorsedd on Music and Poetry concerning the muse, conduct, and learning of all that may come to seek the National Eisteddfod honours, according to the privilege and customs of the Gorsedd of Bards of the Isle of Britain:
:&quot;Voice Against Resounding Voice
:Truth Against the World
:God and All Goodness.&quot;

===Contests===
According to Jan Morris, &quot;The &quot;Eisteddfod Genedlaethol&quot; flourishes as never before, having matured from cranky antiquarianism through rigid chapel respectability to a fairly pragmatic tolerance of public views and social styles. Though its competitions are confined solely to the Welsh language, and even though many Welsh-speaking writers and musicians prefer to have nothing to do with it, still it remains the Chief public expression of the Welsh culture&#x27;s continued existence, the one occasion when a stranger can realize that the language is still creative, the traditions are not lost, and the loyalty of the Welsh to their origins is not dissipated. Honorary membership in the Gorsedd is still the only honour the Welsh nation can bestow upon its sons and daughters, and in a key and of back-handed symbolism, the British Government&#x27;s Secretary of State for Wales is generally invited to open the festival&#x27;s proceedings (generally having to learn a few words of Welsh in order to do so). The Eisteddfod in full fig is rather like a military encampment. All its tents and pavilions are erected around a big central space, the &quot;Maes&quot;, or Field, which is usually scuffed and slippery with mud by the end of the week.&quot;

Morris continues, &quot;Most institutions of modern Wales are represented on the &quot;Maes&quot;, Gas Board to University of Wales Press, the genteel Society for the Protection of Rural Wales to the fiery &quot;Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg&quot; the Welsh Language Society. There are shops selling harps, and comic stickers, and the lewd and racy student magazine, and pottery, and evangelical tracts, and lots and lots of books.&quot;

Also according to Morris, &quot;the Eisteddfod is essentially competitive: there are competitions for &quot;penillion&quot;, and &quot;englynion&quot;, and male voice choirs, and poems in strict meter, and poems in free metre, and essays, and translations, and plays, and short stories.&quot; Also, according to Morris, &quot;outside the , the Literary Tent, poets mutter couplets to themselves, or exchange bitter Bardic complaints.&quot;
However, the most important events at any eisteddfod are the chairing of the bard who has written the best &quot;awdl&quot;, or poem in strict meter, based on a title chosen by the judges, and the crowning of the bard who has written the best &quot;pryddest&quot;, or poem in free verse, with a similarly predetermined title.

According to Morris, &quot;When Welsh poets speak of &quot;free verse&quot;, they mean forms like the sonnet or the ode, which obey the same rules as English poesy. Strict Metres verse still honours the immensely complex rules laid down for correct poetic composition 600 years ago.&quot;

During these ceremonies, according to Morris, &quot;the whole assembly seems to turn towards the Grand Pavilion, claimed to be the largest movable structure in the world. Multitudes jam its doors then, as cameras swing about its gantries, and the worthies of the Gorsedd of the Isle of Britain, robed in green, white, and blue, are unloaded from buses at its entrance.&quot;

Before the Archdruid of the Gorsedd reveals the identity of the winning poet, the (a trumpet) blares to the east, west, north, and south to symbolically call the people together from the four corners of Wales. The &quot;Gorsedd Prayer&quot; is then recited. Flanked by his fellow members of the Gorsedd in ceremonial Neo-Druidic robes, as well as the Herald, the Recorder, and the Swordbearer, the Archdruid partially withdraws the Great Sword from its sheath three times, and asks, &quot;?&quot; (&#x27;Is there peace?&#x27;), to which the assembly replies, &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Peace&#x27;). The Great Sword is then driven fully back into its sheath, and is never drawn again until the next eisteddfod the following year. &quot;Green clad elves come dancing in&quot;, escorting a young local married woman, who presents the Horn of Plenty to the Archdruid and urges him to drink of the &#x27;wine of welcome&#x27;. A young girl presents him with a basket of &#x27;flowers from the land and soil of Wales&#x27; and a floral dance is performed, based on a pattern of flower gathering from the fields.

According to Morris, &quot;Harps play. Children sing. The tension mounts, for nobody in that immense audience yet knows who is to be the recipient of all this honour. The winning poet is somewhere among them, but first he must be found.&quot;

The Archdruid then asks one of the judges to comment on the winning entry and explain the reasons why it was chosen. After the judge does so, the Archdruid thanks the judge for his or her, &quot;excellent adjudication&quot;. The Archdruid then announces that if the poet or writer whose , , or essay was submitted under a certain pen name is present, then he or she is stand up.

According to Morris, &quot;the poet has really known for some time that he is the winner, but he pretends a proper astonishment anyway, and is raised faintly resisting to his feet, and out to the aisle, and away up to the platform escorted by Druids. The organ blazes a grand march, the gathering rises to its feet, the cameras whirr, and the bard is throned upon his Bardic throne, attended by elves and trumpeters and druids, in a haze of medallions, oaken wands, gleaming accoutrements and banners talismanically inscribed. Gently he is seated upon the Chair which is itself his prize, and he is proclaimed a champion: not because he won a war or a football game or even an election, but because he is judged by wise men of his nation to have composed a worthy &quot;cywydd&quot; concerning the nature of clouds.&quot;

To win the chair or the crown competitions, particularly at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, grants even previously unknown poets and writers enormous publicity and prestige. The winner of the bardic chair and crown at the National Eisteddfod both receive the lifelong title &quot;prifardd&quot; (&#x27;chief-bard&#x27;). For the same poet to win both the chair and the crown at the same eisteddfod is almost unheard of, but Alan Llwyd and Donald Evans have both succeeded at doing so twice.

According to Hywel Teifi Edwards, the ceremony of presenting the , which has been awarded since 1937, has progressively grown in importance, &quot;but still trails far in the wake of the Chairing and Crowning. The poet is not to be upstaged by novelist, short-story writer, autobiographer, biographer, or what have you. All attempts to transfer the Crown from poetry to prose have been forestalled, the poets rallying to the defense of what is &#x27;rightfully&#x27; theirs with the cry of, &#x27;What we have, we hold.&#x27;&quot;

At the National Eisteddfod, a Gold Medal () is annually awarded in three categories; Fine Art, Architecture, and Craft and Design. Furthermore, the National Eisteddfod&#x27;s open exhibition of art and craft, &quot;Y Lle Celf&quot; (&#x27;The Art Space&#x27;) is one of the highlights of the calendar for Welsh artists.

==History==
===Welsh bardic tradition===
According to Jan Morris, &quot;Welsh creativity is unusually disciplined, for since the earliest times the Welsh artistic tradition has been governed by codes and conventions – perhaps since the Druids, relying as they did entirely upon their memories, drew up rules of composition to make it easier for themselves. In the Wales of the Independence the Bards and Harpers were institutionalized, with their own allotted places in society, their established functions to perform. They regarded poetry and music as professions, for the practice of which one must qualify, like a lawyer or a doctor. There were agreed measurements of value for a work of art, and the subjects of poetry were formalized, consisting at least until the fourteenth century mainly of eulogies and elegies. Musicians were restricted by intricate rules of composition. Poets were governed by the Twenty-Four Strict Metres of the classical Welsh tradition. Among the the Metres still prevail.&quot;

According to Hywel Teifi Edwards, &quot;The Eisteddfod, then, has evolved from a medieval testing-ground-cum-house of correction for professional Bards and Minstrels into a popular festival which annually highlights the literary scene with the aid of the Gorsedd. Lectures and discussions in , followed by reviews of the in a variety of publications help to encourage a deeper and more abiding interest in Welsh literature. That &#x27;The National&#x27; acts as a means of heightening an awareness of language and literature as humanizing forces which no society can neglect with impunity is not too large a claim to make for it.&quot;

Also according to Morris, &quot;literature is the first Welsh glory, poetry its apotheosis, and the company of poets is the nobility of this nation.&quot;

===Eisteddfod origins===

According to Edwards, there is a legend that the first eisteddfod took place at the royal behest of Maelgwn Gwynedd at Conwy during the 6th century. It was Maelgwn&#x27;s wish that the assembled bards and minstrels would compete against each other. First, however, Maelgwn decreed that they must all swim the River Conwy first and that the minstrels must do so carrying the harps on their backs. For this reason, the bards, whom Maelgwn favoured, ended up winning the contest.

According to legend, Gruffudd ap Cynan (1055–1137), the Dublin-born King of Gwynedd from the House of Aberffraw and the descendant of Rhodri Mawr, Sigtrygg Silkbeard, and Brian Boru, not only reformed the Welsh bardic schools to accord with those that trained the Irish language bards, but also served as patron to an eisteddfod at Caerwys during his reign.

The first documented eisteddfod was hosted by Rhys ap Gruffydd, the grandson of Gruffudd ap Cynan through the maternal line and monarch of Deheubarth through his paternal descent from the House of Dinefwr, at Cardigan Castle on Christmas Day, 1176. According to Hywel Teifi Edwards, what few details are recorded of the event in the &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot;, &quot;encourage the view that it could not have been the first of its kind.&quot;

Rhys awarded two chairs as prizes, one for the winner of the poetry competition and the other for music. The bardic chair went to a poet from Gwynedd, while the musical chair went to the son of Eilon the Crythwr, a member of Rhys&#x27;s court. Armchairs were a valuable asset, normally reserved for people of high status.

In 2007, Welsh historian Roger Turvey, writing of Dinefwr Castle, suggested that The Lord Rhys&#x27; idea for a competitive festival of music and poetry at Cardigan Castle may have been inspired by similar contests in other parts of Catholic Europe. In those other countries, aspiring poets were trained through apprenticeship to master craftsmen or by attending schools run by poets&#x27; guilds such as the Puy of France, the Meistersingers of the Holy Roman Empire, or the Rederijkerskamers of the Netherlands, all of which also organized eisteddfod-like contests between poets on patronal feast days of the Roman Catholic liturgical year. The Lord Rhys, Turvey suggested, may have learned about the Puy tradition from the Cambro-Normans in the Welsh Marches or from Welsh mercenary soldiers returning from France.

When asked about Turvey&#x27;s theory, recognized eisteddfod historian Hywel Teifi Edwards said, &quot;It&#x27;s conjecture, but there&#x27;s no doubt that there was a bardic tradition of competition for status before this time.&quot; Edwards further stated that any foreign influence was an indication of how very cosmopolitan Medieval Wales had been. &quot;It&#x27;s a sign of a healthy culture to accept – and marry with – other cultures,&quot; he added.

===Medieval Wales===
The next large-scale eisteddfod that is historically known is the three-month-long 1450 eisteddfod at Carmarthen Castle under Gruffudd ap Nicolas. At the eisteddfod the (&#x27;Silver Chair&#x27;), which is said to have been fashioned by Gruffudd ap Nicolas himself, was won by a &quot;cywydd&quot; in honour of the Holy Trinity composed by Dafydd ab Edmwnd, a Welsh poet who did not depend on noble patronage, from Hanmer, Flintshire. Welsh poet and Roman Catholic priest Llawdden, however, accused Gruffudd ap Nicolas of accepting a bribe from Dafydd ab Edmwnd in return for the Silver Chair.

Dafydd ab Edmwnd&#x27;s exemplified the 24 strict metres of Welsh poetry, previously codified by Einion Offeiriad and Dafydd Ddu o Hiraddug, as Dafydd ab Edmwnd had personally reformed them. He deleted two metres and replaced them with the more complicated &quot;Gorchest y Beirdd&quot; and the &quot;Cadwynfyr&quot;.

The reform of the 24 metres presented by Dafydd was formally accepted at the 1450 Carmarthen eisteddfod and was widely adopted by bards throughout Wales. The consequence of Dafydd&#x27;s reforms was that greater emphasis was placed by the bardic elite upon adhering to the stricter metres rather than to the theme or content of their poetry.

Until this time, the training of Welsh poets had always been a secret, with the craft handed down from teacher to apprentice, but, as the poetry of the professional bards became increasingly incomprehensible, less complex and more popularly oriented works of Welsh poetry began to be composed by bards with humbler origins and less formal training.

According to John Davies, a team of researchers led by Dafydd Bowen has demonstrated that the Welsh bards of the 15th century were completely dependent upon the Welsh nobility and the monks and abbots of monasteries such as Strata Florida and Valle Crucis Abbey for both hospitality and patronage in return for praise poetry. Davies adds, however, that, &quot;in a notable article&quot;, Welsh nationalist and traditional Catholic writer Saunders Lewis argued that the Welsh bards of the era, &quot;were expressing in their poetry a love for a stable, deep-rooted civilization.&quot; Lewis added that the bards &quot;were the leading upholders of the belief that a hierarchical social structure, &#x27;the heritage and tradition of an ancient aristocracy&#x27;, were the necessary precondition of civilized life and that there were deep philosophical roots to this belief.&quot;

The next eisteddfod that is historically documented is the 1451 Carmarthen eisteddfod.

In 1523, an eisteddfod was held at Caerwys under King Henry VIII&#x27;s charter and was led by Welsh bard and future Franciscan friar, Tudur Aled. At the urging of the aristocratic Mostyn family of Talacre Hall, a Statute, which was attributed to King Gruffydd ap Cynan of Gwynedd, was used as the basis for the eisteddfod. The Statute listed the rights of bards in Welsh culture and under traditional Welsh law, while also arguing that bards should not drink to excess, womanize, or gamble. In addition, the Statute further stated that a true bard must never write satirical poetry and codified the rules of praise poetry at a time when the Welsh bardic tradition of was increasingly under threat and, &quot;demanded that the bard celebrate in elevated language the orderliness of a God-centered world.&quot;

===The Welsh Reformation===
Queen Elizabeth I of England commanded that Welsh bards be examined and licensed by officials of the Crown, who had alleged that those whom they considered genuine bards were, &quot;much discouraged to travail in the exercise and practice of their knowledge and also not a little hindered in their living and preferments.&quot; Unlicensed bards, according to Hywel Teifi Edwards, &quot;would be put to some honest work.&quot; Although Edwards has compared the unlicensed bards of the era with, &quot;today&#x27;s abusers of the Social security system,&quot; historian Philip Caraman quotes a 1575 &quot;Report on Wales&quot; that reveals an additional reason for the decree. During the Queen&#x27;s ongoing religious persecution of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, many Welsh (&#x27;head bards&#x27;) were, according to the report, acting as the secret emissaries of Recusants in the Welsh nobility and were helping those nobles spread the news about secret Catholic masses and pilgrimages.

This was no idle claim. When Welsh Recusant, schoolmaster, and unlicensed bard Richard Gwyn was put on trial for high treason before a panel of judges headed by the Chief Justice of Chester, Sir George Bromley, at Wrexham in 1583, Gwyn stood accused of refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy, denying the Queen&#x27;s claim to be Supreme Head of the Church of England, of involvement in the local Catholic underground, but also of composing satirical poetry aimed at the established church and reciting, &quot;certain rhymes of his own making against married priests and ministers.&quot; Gwyn was found guilty and condemned to death by hanging, drawing and quartering. The sentence was carried out in the Beast Market in Wrexham on 15 October 1584. Just before Gwyn was hanged he turned to the crowd and said, &quot;I have been a jesting fellow, and if I have offended any that way, or by my songs, I beseech them for God&#x27;s sake to forgive me.&quot; The hangman pulled at Gwyn&#x27;s leg irons hoping to put him out of his pain. When he appeared dead they cut him down, but he revived and remained conscious through the disembowelling, until his head was severed. His last words, in Welsh, were reportedly &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Jesus, have mercy on me&#x27;).

Richard Gwyn was canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970 as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. His feast day is celebrated on 17 October. Following Catholic Emancipation in 1829, six works of Christian poetry in the Welsh language by Richard Gwyn, five carols and a satirical Cywydd composed in Wrexham Gaol following the assassination of Dutch Revolt leader William the Silent by Balthasar Gérard, were discovered and published. Similar Welsh poetry in strict metre survives from other Recusant Bards of the era, such as Robert Gwin, Catrin ferch Gruffudd ap Hywel, and Gruffydd Robert.

Despite their battles being so similar to his own against government censorship, Sir Philip Sidney, in &quot;An Apology for Poetry&quot;, expressed both admiration for and envy of the prestige that poets enjoyed in Welsh culture, which he contrasted with what he described as the Elizabethan era tendency in English culture to treat poets as unwanted stepchildren, &quot;In Wales, the true remnant of the ancient Brittons, as there are good authorities to show, the long time they had poets which they called Bards: so through all the conquests of Romans, Saxons, Danes, and Normans, some of whom, did seek to ruin all memory of learning from among them, yet do their poets even to this day last: so as it is not more notable in the soon beginning, then in long continuing.&quot;

Likely due to the continued existence of Recusant Bards, the 1567 and 1568 Caerwys eisteddfodau were patronized by the Queen, so that, &quot;all or every person or persons that intend to maintain their living by name or colour of Minstrelsy, rhymers, or bards... shall.. shew their learning thereby&quot;, and overseen by the officials of her Council of Wales and the Marches. By royal decree, only Welsh bards licensed by the officials of the Queen were permitted to compete.

At the eisteddfod held in Caerwys in 1568, the prizes awarded were a miniature silver chair to the winning poet, a little silver crwth to the winning fiddler, a silver tongue to the best singer, and a tiny silver harp to the best harpist. The chief chaired bard of the event was Robert Davies (from Nant-glyn) and the second being &quot;&quot;.

The official Anglican translation of the Bible into the Welsh language, which continues to have an enormous influence on the Welsh poetry submitted to the eisteddfodau, saw its first publication in 1588. The translator, Reverend William Morgan, was a Cambridge graduate and later became Anglican Bishop of Llandaff and St Asaph. He based his Biblical translation on the Hebrew and Greek original Bibles, while also consulting the English Bishops&#x27; and Geneva translations. &quot;Y Beibl cyssegr-lan&quot;, as it was called, also included original translations as well as adaptations of William Salesbury&#x27;s Welsh New Testament. No other book in the Welsh language has been anywhere near as influential in linguistic or literary terms. Bishop Morgan skillfully moulded the Middle Welsh literary language of the medieval bards (, or &#x27;the old language&#x27;) into the Elizabethan-era (&#x27;literary Welsh&#x27;) still in use today. Even though there is a major difference between and all 21st century spoken dialects of the Welsh language, eisteddfod submissions are still required to be composed in the literary language of Bishop Morgan&#x27;s Bible, which remains the foundation upon which all subsequent Welsh literature has been built.

===Decline===
According to Marcus Tanner, Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s experiment at royal patronage of the eisteddfod did not catch on and, as the 16th and 17th centuries progressed, the Welsh nobility became increasingly Anglicized and ceased to grant employment or hospitality to Welsh-language poets. Although eisteddfodau continued, the gatherings became more informal; Welsh poets would often meet in taverns, cemeteries, or inns to have &quot;assemblies of rhymers&quot;. But the interest of the Welsh people dwindled to such a point that the eisteddfod held at Glamorgan in 1620 attracted an audience of only four people. The winners, however, continued to receive a chair, which was a highly prized award because of its perceived social status.

Throughout the medieval period, high-backed chairs with arm rests were reserved for royalty and high-status leaders in military, religious, or political affairs. As most ordinary people sat on stools until the 1700s, the award of an armchair immediately changed the social class of a winning bard.

In 1701, an eisteddfod was held at Machynlleth in order, &quot;To begin to renew the eisteddfod of bards (as they were in olden times), to reprimand false cynghanedd, to explain the difficult things, and to confirm what is correct in the art of poetry in the Welsh language.&quot;

The 1701 eisteddfod was followed, according to Edwards, by a series of , so called because they were widely advertised in the cheap almanacs that were widely available. The and composed for these events &quot;owe more to the beery atmosphere at which they were composed than to genuine inspiration and craft.&quot;

In 1734, Siôn Rhydderch organized an eisteddfod adjudicated by a panel of 12 judges at Dolgellau, but upon his arrival there was greeted by only six poets, &quot;and all the signs of apathy and dejection.&quot;

Comparing this disappointing response to what he saw as the glory of the Elizabethan-era eisteddfodau at Caerwys, Rhydderch vowed that he would have no role in further efforts to revive the tradition, &quot;unless some others may feel like restarting and setting up the thing. And if it will be like that, if I am alive and well, I shall not be hindered from coming to that.&quot;

===Late 18th-century Revival===
In 1788, Thomas Jones and Jonathan Hughes asked the London-based Gwyneddigion Society to donate, &quot;some small present out of goodwill to those who are trying to crawl after their mother tongue.&quot;

Although the Gwyneddigion Society agreed, they laid down certain conditions to their support that permanently altered the future course of the eisteddfod and its traditions. The Gwyneddigion claimed for themselves the right to proclaim both the eisteddfod and the theme of the main competition which they alone would set, one year in advance. The poems were to be submitted under pseudonyms and would be adjudicated solely upon their literary merits. The poems and the adjudicator&#x27;s comments would then be forwarded to the eisteddfod in a sealed package. The adjudicators were to be able men for the job and were to choose the winning entry based upon &quot;purity of language and regular composition of the poems to be among their chief merits.&quot;

The adjudicators were to meet together and give an impartial decision and, in the event of any disagreement, the Gwyneddigion would endeavor to resolve the dispute. The name of the winning poet would be announced upon the first day of the eisteddfod and, owing to the dignity of his status as , the winner was not to compete alongside the other poets in the composition of impromptu verse.

In so doing, the Gwyneddigion laid down the framework for the modern National Eisteddfod of Wales. According to Hywel Teifi Edwards, &quot;there was to be notice given a year in advance of &quot;one&quot; organized, annual eisteddfod answerable to a central, controlling authority which would require competitors to submit their compositions pseudonymously to a panel of competent adjudicators.&quot;

Although the Gwyneddigion did not succeed in their ambition of transforming the eisteddfod &quot;into an Academy that would act as a forcing house for Welsh culture&quot;, they have wielded considerable influence over continued requirement for long poems as eisteddfod submissions. Furthermore, in reaction to the incomprehensibility of Welsh poetry composed in strict meter, the Gwyneddigion held up the recent poetry of Reverend Goronwy Owen as a better model.

Long before his death on his tobacco and cotton plantation near Lawrenceville, Virginia in 1769, Owen had often expressed the desire to compose an epic work of Christian poetry which would be the equal of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Owen felt, however, that the rules of Welsh poetry in strict meter prevented him from doing so. Therefore, by holding Owen up as a model, the Gwyneddigion ensured that his literary legacy is that, as late as 1930, both the adjudicators and the poets composing submissions to the National Eisteddfod of Wales were aspiring to produce the Welsh national epic that Owen had longed to write in vain.

The first eisteddfod of the revival, for which &quot;Thomas Jones simply used&quot; the name of the Gwyneddigion &quot;for promotional purposes&quot;, was held at Corwen in May 1789. Gwallter Mechain was judged the winner, having illegally been informed in advance by Thomas Jones of the subjects for the impromptu poetry contests. Despite outraged complaints by Gwallter Mechain&#x27;s competitors, the Gwyneddigion upheld the judges&#x27; decision.

The first eisteddfod held in full accordance with the Gwyneddigion Society&#x27;s new rules was held at Bala in September 1789. The that were submitted for the bardic chair were on the theme (&#x27;A Consideration of Man&#x27;s Life&#x27;) and, according to Edwards, &quot;heralded the appearance of the new .&quot;

According to Hywel Teifi Edwards, while the awarding of a chair is a very old tradition, the now-familiar ceremony of the chairing of the bard who has composed the best awdl dates from the eisteddfod revival of the early 1790s.

During the 1790 eisteddfod held at St. Asaph, Gwyneddigion Society member Edward Williams, whose bardic name was Iolo Morganwg, became convinced that he and his fellow Welsh poets were the descendants of the Druids and that the eisteddfod was a survival of Druidic ritual. In response, Iolo Morganwg, according to Marcus Tanner, &quot;reintroduced what he considered the ritual of an ancient Bardic congress to a series of rather ordinary literary proceedings conducted chiefly in hotels.&quot;

To accomplish this end, in 1792 Iolo Morganwg founded a secret society of Welsh poets, which he dubbed &quot;Gorsedd Beirdd Ynys Prydain&quot;. Morganwg also invented its structure and rituals, for which he drew upon on a mixture of Freemasonry, Welsh mythology, modern Druidry, and some Christian elements. Morganwg alleged, however, that the Gorsedd was a survival from pre-Christian Wales. The fictitious origin of Morganwg&#x27;s claims and of the Gorsedd&#x27;s ceremonies were firmly established only in the 20th century by Professor G.J. Williams.

In October 1792, &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; reported, &quot;This being the day on which the autumnal equinox occurred, some Welsh bards resident in London assembled in congress on Primrose Hill, according to ancient usage... A circle of stones formed, in the middle of which was the Maan Gorsedd, or altar, on which a naked sword being placed, all the Bards assisted to sheathe it. This ceremony was attended with a proclamation, the substance of which was that the Bards of the Isles of Britain (for such is their ancient name) were the heralds and ministers of peace.&quot;

In 1814, an observer caught sight of Iolo Morganwg walking behind a banner at Pontypridd, &quot;at the head of a procession... over the great bridge and then over to the Rocking Stone on the common above. Ancient ceremonies were performed on the great stone by Iolo in the role of Y Gwyddon, or Odin, the Archdruid, not the least being the sheathing the State Sword of Wales to convey the valuable lesson, as in Gethsemane, that there is more credit in sheathing the sabre than in drawing it forth among the sons of men.&quot;

The eisteddfod revival, however, was briefly brought to a halt by the Napoleonic Wars, but was again restarted following the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

===1801–1860===
The earliest known surviving bardic chair made specifically for an eisteddfod was constructed in 1819. Iolo Morganwg and the Gorsedd made their first appearance at the same eisteddfod, which was held at the Ivy Bush Inn at Carmarthen in 1819, and its close association with the festival has continued since then.

Also at the 1819 Carmarthen eisteddfod, Iolo Morganwg presented a freer code of meters. While still defending the superiority of &quot;cynghanedd&quot;, Morganwg said this had also been used in Gwent and Glamorgan for centuries prior to Dafydd ab Edmwnd&#x27;s 15th century reforms. This led, after considerable debate between traditionalists and innovators, to the adoption of the eisteddfod contest for best and the ceremony of the crowning of the bard.

Meanwhile, Archdeacon Thomas Beynon, the president of the Carmarthen Cymreigyddion Society and a staunch patron of the provincial eisteddfodau, was persistently urging for the adoption of blank verse, or unrhymed iambic pentameter, as another alternative to Welsh poetry in strict meter.

Meanwhile, all poems submitted to eisteddfodau began being published in 1822, which allowed for the first time for the Welsh people to read the poems and to decide for themselves about their merits and flaws.

At the 1824 National Eisteddfod in Powys, satirical poetry in the traditional &quot;englyn&quot; form was submitted under the pre-announced title &quot;Beddargraff Dic Siôn Dafydd&quot; (&quot;The Epitaph of Dic Siôn Dafydd&quot;).

According to Hywel Teifi Edwards, &quot;Ten &#x27;Provincial Eisteddfodau&#x27; were held between 1819 and 1834, eisteddfodau on a scale never witnessed before. They were patronized by Anglicized gentry and graced by royalty when George IV&#x27;s brother, the Duke of Sussex, appeared at Denbigh in 1828 to be followed at Beaumaris in 1832 by the young Princess Victoria and her mother.&quot;

Following the 1847 attack by the Blue Books against the moral character of the Welsh people, Welsh poetry composed for the eisteddfodau &quot;found itself trapped within the part allotted the Welsh language in the counterattack against the Blue Books.&quot; For this reason, much of the poetry written sought to promote an image of the Welsh people as &quot;God-fearing, Queen-loving&quot;, and, &quot;Empire-supporting.&quot;

At the 1850 Rhuddlan Royal Eisteddfod, £25 and a Chair Medallion were offered for the best on the theme (&#x27;the Resurrection&#x27;). The poets were allowed to choose the meter, excluding blank verse, that best suited them. Caledfryn submitted an , while Eben Fardd and Evan Evans (Ieuan Glan Geirionydd) submitted Alexandrine . In a judgment unheard-of in Eisteddfod history: Ieuan Glan Gerionydd&#x27;s Alexandrine was judged superior and was awarded the £25 and Chair Medallion over Caledfryn&#x27;s in strict metre.

Upon the publication of all the Eisteddfod&#x27;s submissions, however, Eben Fardd&#x27;s attempt at an epic work of Christian poetry was &quot;hailed by the literati as a work of distinction far surpassing the pallid, common-sense poem written by Ieuan Glan Gerionydd&quot;. As Eben Fardd&#x27;s had been relegated to third place by the judges, it was widely felt that something was seriously wrong with adjudication standards and &quot;talk of eisteddfod reform was in the air.&quot;

In 1858 John Williams, whose bardic name was &quot;Ab Ithel&quot;, held a &quot;national&quot; eisteddfod with the &quot;Gorsedd Cymru&quot; in Llangollen. &quot;The great Llangollen Eisteddfod of 1858&quot; proved highly significant for several reasons. For example, John Williams (the event&#x27;s organiser), offered £20 and a Silver Star for the best essay on the theme, &quot;The Discovery of America in the 12th-century by Prince Madoc ab Owain Gwynedd&quot;. This was, according to Hywel Teifi Edwards, a subject inspired by Iolo Morganwg.

Instead, Welsh historian Thomas Stephens submitted an essay that, in what Edwards has described, as a &quot;scholarly tour de force, demolished the cherished myth&quot;. In response, Ab Ithel decreed, &quot;that the essay broke with the spirit of the competition&quot;, and would not be awarded the prize. In response, a scandalized crowd followed Stephens into the Cambrian Tent, where he read his essay aloud before them despite Ab Ithel&#x27;s efforts to drown him out with a convenient brass band. Despite having been denied the prize, Stephens succeeded in persuading his audience that Prince Madoc did not in fact discover the New World.

The Llangollen eisteddfod also saw the first public appearance of John Ceiriog Hughes, who won a prize for the love poem, &quot;Myfanwy&quot; , which contradicts the Blue Books by describing a virtuous Welsh woman. As may be expected, the song became an instant hit. This eisteddfod outraged the English-language press. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;a national debauch of sentimentality&quot;. A writer for &quot;The Times&quot; went even farther, calling the eisteddfod &quot;simply foolish interference with the natural progress of civilization and prosperity – it is a monstrous folly to encourage the Welsh in a loving fondness for their old language.&quot;

Before the 1858 Llangollen eisteddfod was over, however, a meeting of Welsh literati had taken place and decided that an annual national eisteddfod, conducted with due regard for standards, was long overdue. , a national body guided by an elected council, was formed and the Gorsedd subsequently merged with it. The Gorsedd holds the right of proclamation and of governance while the council organizes the event. The first true National Eisteddfod organized by the council was held in Aberdare in 1861 on a pattern that continues to the present day.

===1861–1900===
According to Hywel Teifi Edwards, &quot;The 1860s found the eisteddfod poet beset with doubt, as the words of Eben Fardd and Talhaiarn (John Jones 1810–69), two of the foremost poets of the time, prove. Both accepted the subservience of their mother tongue and the diminished role of the poet in the steam age. If poetry &quot;per se&quot; was of questionable value, how much more so Welsh poetry, and strict meter poetry at that? What could be less marketable in an age that marketed English was with &quot;progress&quot; than Welsh poetry? It was galling when Fleet Street taunted Wales with its want of a Shakespeare, a Milton, a Wordsworth or a Tennyson. It was shattering when Matthew Arnold, scourge of philistinism and hawker of Celtic magic, insisted that any Welsh poet with anything worth saying should say it in English. Edward Dafydd, in 1655, expressed the sense of desolation he felt as he pondered the passing of the old order and the coming of a bleak age: (&#x27;This world is not for poets.&#x27;) He could well have been speaking for the poets of the 1860s.&quot;

Also during the Victorian era, the poets who won the chair or the crown at the National Eisteddfod were praised to a degree that subsequent literary critics and historians have found not only excessive, but &quot;ludicrous&quot;. According to Edwards, however, &quot;It is easy to laugh at the besotted rhetoric of the period, but let us remember how starved of respect Welsh literature was for most of the time and how marginal was the role allotted to most writers. The Eisteddfod, with its huge audience, offered both glory and economic reward. It is perfectly natural, given the circumstances, that the accolade &#x27;National Winner&#x27; should be surrounded with so much hype and sought after so frantically.&quot;

Perhaps for these reasons, during the late 19th century, according to Edwards, &quot;Wales still pursued &#x27;the one poem&#x27; that alone, the Renaissance had taught, justified a literature&#x27;s claim to greatness.&quot;

The Welsh poet Lewis William Lewis (1831–1901), whose bardic name was Llew Llwyfo, repeatedly attempted in his eisteddfod submissions to, &quot;achieve the national epic that would merit translation into the major literatures&quot;. He chose subjects such as Caractacus, the Arthurian legend, Llewellyn the Last, and even the Old Testament King David. Although Edwards is very critical of Llew Llwyfo and accuses him of following the then common practice of imitating Victorian-era English poetry, Lewis&#x27; poetry repeatedly won first prize at multiple eisteddfodau held both in Wales and within Welsh-American immigrant communities.

Tragically, however, &quot;a Welsh epic refused to materialize. A succession of aspirants rifled the works of authorities from Homer to Bulwer-Lytton in the hope of hitting upon a formula that would take.&quot;

According to Jan Morris, &quot;By the end of the century, Hubert Herkomer, one of the most fashionable painters of his day, had created for [the Gorsedd]&#x27;s functionaries gloriously neo-Druidical robes and insignia of gold, velvet, and ermine (the Archdruid&#x27;s breastplate was designed to choke him, Herkomer said, if he gave a false judgement).&quot;

===1901–1920===
Even though the title had been previously chosen by the eisteddfod judges, almost certainly in the hope of inspiring a Welsh equivalent to Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;, Thomas Gwynn Jones&#x27; hugely influential , &quot;Ymadawiad Arthur&quot; (&quot;The Passing of Arthur&quot;) won its author the bardic chair at the National Eisteddfod in 1902.

The poem, according to Hywel Teifi Edwards, &quot;brought back some of the mythopoeic grandeur which John Morris-Jones yearned for. More than that, he made of Bedwyr, the knight charged by Arthur to throw the great sword Excalibur into the lake, a prototype of the twentieth-century Welshman who, from generation to generation, armed only with a vision of his culture&#x27;s worth, fights for its survival against an all-devouring materialism. Bedwyr, agonizing over the catastrophe which he feared would befall his defenseless country should he obey Arthur&#x27;s command, is one of the most deeply moving figures in Welsh literature. Denied the security of a matchless weapon, the last tangible proof of Arthur&#x27;s supernatural strength, he must fight on with only his faith in Arthur&#x27;s promised return from Afalon to sustain him.&quot;

Unlike the many works of English, French, and German poetry inspired by the Arthurian legend, makes frequent references to Welsh literature and the Welsh mythology of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, and is believed to derive its narrative flow from Jones&#x27;s careful study of that same source. William Beynon Davies further considers a work of subtly Christian poetry based on its many Biblical parallels, as King Arthur resembles in some ways the Messiah and in others the Suffering Servant.

Thomas Gwynn Jones has been called the greatest master of Welsh poetry in strict meter since the 15th century and, in , according to one critic, the &quot;cynghanedd&quot; &quot;is so smooth and natural that often we deem it accidental&quot;. It is well documented, however, that Jones carefully studied medieval &quot;cywyddau&quot;, and the verse technique of benefited substantially from this study. The poem is also notable for Jones&#x27; revival of many words from Medieval Welsh, Jones being an influential exponent of what he called (&quot;The Virtue of the Old Language&quot;).

In 1905, Thomas Marchant Williams was knighted by King Edward VII for his part in the revival of the Cymmrodorion Society and the establishment of the National Eisteddfod Association.

During the 1912 National Eisteddfod at Wrexham, T.H. Parry-Williams achieved for the first time the almost unheard of feat of winning both the chair and the crown. Parry-Williams later recalled returning home to Rhyd-ddu, where had been working as a hired hand on the farm of a relative. Upon telling his employer of his double victory, Parry-Williams was advised to &quot;seek grace&quot;. When Parry-Williams then informed his employer that both victories had gained him £40, the relative shouted in angry disbelief, &quot;!!!&quot; (&#x27;And you did them all sitting on your arse!!!&#x27;)

One of the most dramatic events in the 900-year history of the eisteddfod took place on 6 September 1917, during World War I. It was the award of the bardic chair during the second day of the 1917 National Eisteddfod of Wales at Birkenhead Park in the English town of the same name. The three adjudicators in the chair competition agreed unanimously that the best by far on the set theme (&#x27;The Hero&#x27;) had been submitted under the pseudonym &quot;Fleur-de-lis&quot;. The bard was then summoned three times by the Archdruid Dyfed to stand up, in vain. The Archdruid then announced that the poet who submitted the winning had died during the short time between mailing his submission and the date of the eisteddfod. His name was Private Ellis Humphrey Evans, whose bardic name was Hedd Wyn (&#x27;Blessed Peace&#x27;), of the 15th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers, and he had fallen during the trench warfare, &quot;somewhere in France&quot;. The bardic chair was covered with a black sheet and, according to newspaper reports, &quot;there wasn&#x27;t a dry eye in the pavilion.&quot; Ever since, the 1917 National Eisteddfod of Wales has been referred to as &quot;&quot; (&#x27;The Eisteddfod of the Black Chair&#x27;). 
According to Jan Morris, &quot;Hedd Wyn became a legend, a symbol, and an inspiration to other poets. &#x27;The Black Chair of Birkenhead&#x27; was taken sadly home to Gwynedd, to be placed with the other trophies of Hedd Wyn&#x27;s short life in the family farm above the Bala road, and there we may visit it still. It has never been forgotten. A constant stream of visitors, patriots, poets, groups of schoolchildren, winds its way up the long farm drive, in the lee of the hills, to the old house among its clumped trees. It stands there all alone looking out magnificently over bare hills to the ramparts of Eryri in the distance – the very epitome of a Welsh view, all grandeur tinged with melancholy. The Black Chair is kept in a sort of shrine-room, dim-lit and cluttered. Around it three or four other &quot;eisteddfod&quot; chairs stand in attendance, like sacred stools in an Ashanti temple...&quot;

Evans lies buried at Artillery Wood Cemetery, near Boezinge, Belgium. After the Armistice, a petition was submitted to the Imperial War Graves Commission and his headstone was given the additional words (&#x27;The Chief Bard, Hedd Wyn&#x27;).

===1921–1960===
In the 1921 National Eisteddfod at Caernarfon, Reverend Albert Evans-Jones (Cynan) won the bardic crown for his , (&quot;the Cottage Lad&quot;). Cynan was a native of Pwllheli and had served in the RAMC during World War I. Cynan drew for his winning upon both the poetry of John Masefield and upon his own experiences in the Macedonian front and in the trenches of France. &quot;tells, in a gushingly romantic, lyrical style how a young &quot;gwerinwr&quot;, scarred by the horrors of war, turns from the fetid city to seek spiritual renewal in the natural beauty of his home and the love of a pure country girl.&quot; Cynan&#x27;s poem has been called the best-loved ever composed during the 20th century and many Welsh people, according to Hywel Teifi Edwards, are still able to recite long passages of it from memory. Alan Llwyd, who has translated part of into English for the 2008 book &quot;Out of the Fire of Hell: Welsh Experience of the Great War 1914–1918 in Prose and Verse&quot;, has argued that Cynan, rather than the far more famous Hedd Wyn, is the greatest Welsh war poet.

Plaid Cymru, a Welsh nationalist and social democratic political party, was founded during the 1925 National Eisteddfod at Pwllheli, Gwynedd. Inspired by the recent Irish War of Independence, Saunders Lewis, Huw Robert Jones, Lewis Valentine, Moses Griffith, Fred Jones and D. Edmund Williams met in a café called Maes Gwyn with the aim of establishing a &quot;Welsh party&quot;. During the meeting, they founded &quot;&quot; (&quot;National Party of Wales&quot;), on 5 August 1925. The principal aim of the party would be to foster a Welsh-speaking Wales. To this end it was agreed that party business be conducted in Welsh, and that members must sever all links with other British political parties. Saunders Lewis insisted upon these principles before he would agree to the Pwllheli conference.

At the 1936 National Eisteddfod held at Fishguard (), the set title for the Bardic Crown was (&#x27;The Wasteland&#x27;), which was almost certainly inspired by T.S. Eliot&#x27;s famous Modernist poem of the same name. Instead of copying Eliot, however, Welsh poet David Jones (of the bardic name, , ) of Cilfynydd won the Crown with a about black lung disease and the damage it was wreaking upon the coal-mining communities in the South Wales valleys.

Reverend Albert Evans-Jones (Cynan) served a term as the Recorder of the Gorsedd Cymru in 1935, and another as joint-secretary of the National Eisteddfod Council in 1937.

According to Hywel Teifi Edwards, &quot;The Second World War, which plumbed new depths of bestiality culminating in the atomic bomb, put the fear of national extinction in a world-wide context. The Welsh, fighting a long battle for cultural survival, found themselves subsumed, as it were, in a universal army. The cry that went up after Nagasaki and Hiroshima, &quot;We are all survivors now!&quot;, was easily understood by Welsh writers. At that point, the age-old fight to perpetuate a culture steeped in the Christian tradition was more clearly discerned as the crazy militarism of the superpowers moved the world ever nearer to the abyss. The loss of Welshness now, far from being a sign of &quot;progress&quot;, would merely conduce to the spread of the uniformity of mind so beloved of totalitarians everywhere. Such a conviction has served to intensify the fight for the language, for to lose would be to ease the path of those forces that threaten the whole of mankind.&quot;

===1961–2000===

In response to the 1961 census, which showed a radical decrease in the percentage of Welsh speakers, Saunders Lewis gave the famous 1962 radio address &quot;&quot; (&#x27;The Fate of the Language&#x27;) in which he predicted the imminent extinction of the Welsh language unless immediate action was taken. Lewis hoped to motivate Plaid Cymru into directly fighting for the language. Instead, his address led to the 1962 foundation of &quot;Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg&quot; (&quot;The Welsh Language Society&quot;) at a Plaid Cymru summer school held in Pontardawe in Glamorgan.

It has been said that, &quot;of all the memorable phrases coined in the twentieth century none has greater resonance for the Welsh speaker than . . . which still haunts or inspires champions of the native tongue on the cusp of the new millennium&quot;. In 1985, the long-term effects of Saunders Lewis&#x27; were listed by Gwyn Williams: the formation of in 1962, direct action against English-language offices, roadsigns, and TV masts, sit-ins and demonstrations, Welsh-language schools, the 1973 adoption of adult education in the Welsh language based upon the Ulpan system created in the State of Israel for teaching the Hebrew language and Israeli culture to adult immigrants, the 1964 creation of the office of Secretary of State for Wales, the 1967 passing of the Welsh Language Act, the creation of S4C, and the mushrooming of Welsh-language publishing, film production, pop and rock, as well as youth and urban music.

Reverend Albert Evans-Jones (Cynan) served as Archdruid twice and is the only person ever to have been elected to that position for a second term. His two terms were from 1950 to 1954 and from 1963 to 1966. He was also the first Archdruid to accept that the Gorsedd is an 18th-century invention by Iolo Morganwg and that it has no links to Welsh mythology or to the ancient Druids, thus healing rifts between the academic and ecclesiastical establishments and the eisteddfod movement.

Cynan is also responsible for designing the modern ceremonies of the crowning and chairing of the bard in the eisteddfod as they are now performed, by creating ceremonies which, he thought, better reflected the Christian beliefs of the Welsh people.

In 1969, Cynan was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II as part of the honours at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales for Cynan&#x27;s services to both Welsh culture and literature. He remains the only Archdruid ever to have been so honoured.

Although it has been held since 1929, the most notable event in the history of the Welsh youth festival known as the Urdd National Eisteddfod took place at Aberystwyth, also in 1969. Charles, Prince of Wales was invited, so giving him a public platform from which to address the crowd. It was the same year as his investiture as Prince of Wales, which had outraged many Welsh nationalists, particularly those with leanings towards republicanism. For this reason, as the Prince arrived on stage, more than one hundred people stood up and walked out in protest. The fallout afterwards was heated and an editorial in the Welsh-language newspaper &quot;Y Cymro&quot; severely angered the director of the Urdd National Eisteddfod.

In a parallel with the simultaneous literary movement known as New Formalism in American poetry, the late 20th century witnessed a renaissance in Welsh poetry composed in strict meter, especially &quot;englynion&quot; and &quot;cywyddau&quot;. This renaissance is largely inspired by the poetry of Alan Llwyd. Llwyd, a native of Dolgellau, Gwynedd, first came to prominence with the almost unheard of feat of winning both the chair and the crown at the 1973 National Eisteddfod and then repeating the same feat in 1976.

The 1982 bardic chair was awarded to Gerallt Lloyd Owen for the &quot;awdl&quot; &quot;Cilmeri&quot;, which Hywel Teifi Edwards has called the only 20th-century &quot;,&quot; that matches T. Gwynn Jones&#x27; 1902 masterpiece (&#x27;The Passing of Arthur&#x27;). Owen&#x27;s reimagines the death of Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd of the House of Gwynedd in battle near the village of that name in 1282, while leading a doomed uprising against the occupation of Wales by King Edward I of England. Owen&#x27;s poem depicts the Prince as a tragic hero and invests his fall with an anguish unmatched since Gruffudd ab yr Ynad Coch wrote his famous lament for the Prince immediately following his death. Owen also, according to Edwards, encapsulates in the Prince&#x27;s death the Welsh people&#x27;s continuing &quot;battle for national survival.&quot;

In 1999 the centenary of early Gaelic revival poet and Easter Rising leader Patrick Pearse&#x27;s initiation into the Gorsedd at the 1899 Pan Celtic Eisteddfod in Cardiff (where he took the Bardic name of Areithiwr) was marked by the unveiling of a plaque at the Consulate General of the Irish Republic in Wales.

===21st century===
In a ceremony held entirely in the Welsh language during the 2002 National Eisteddfod at St. David&#x27;s, Rowan Williams, the Anglican Archbishop of Wales, was sworn into the Gorsedd as a &quot;White Druid&quot; under the bardic name &quot;Ap Aneurin&quot;.

According to Marcus Tanner, &quot;The hour-long ritual, which took place at dawn inside a circle of improvised standing stones, seemed culled from the pages of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, not least because the more intrusive signs of modern technology, such as loudspeakers, had been concealed beneath wreaths of foliage. After a fanfare of trumpets and the playing of a harp, the Archbishop, dressed in white, laid his hands on a huge sword before being escorted into the heart of the stone circle to meet the horn of plenty. For all its appeal to antiquity, the rite that the company followed was one Iolo Morganwg would have recognized, since he invented it.&quot;

In response to sharp criticisms of Archbishop Williams by the English-language media and other Christian clergy, &quot;for having taken part in a Pagan ritual&quot;, the Archdruid Robyn Lewis said, &quot;Iolo did create his Gorsedd while fantasizing about Pre-Christian times, but as it developed it rapidly became a mainstream Christian organization.&quot;

During the 2018 National Eisteddfod at Cardiff, the bardic crown was awarded to poet and Welsh nationalist Catrin Dafydd, born in Gwaelod y Garth, for her collection (&quot;Traces&quot;). Her poems explored Welsh identity in the multiracial and multiethnic Grangetown district of Cardiff.

During the ceremony, however, the Archdruid, Geraint Llifon, caused considerable outrage among feminists when he alleged that Catrin Dafydd could not have won the Crown without the help of men. After this caused him to be accused of sexism, Archdruid Llifon apologized.

==Current eisteddfodau==

=== Eisteddfodau in Wales ===

====National Eisteddfod====
The most important is the National Eisteddfod of Wales, the largest festival of competitive music and poetry in Europe. Its eight days of competitions and performances, entirely in the Welsh language, are staged annually in the first week of August in varying locations that usually alternate between north and south Wales. Competitors typically number 6,000 or more; overall attendances generally exceed 150,000 visitors.

==== Urdd National Eisteddfod ====


Another important eisteddfod in the calendar is or the Youth Eisteddfod. Organised by Urdd Gobaith Cymru, it involves young Welsh people from nursery age to 25 in a week of competition in singing, recitation, dancing, acting and musicianship during the summer half-term school holiday. The event is claimed to be Europe&#x27;s premier youth arts festival. Regional heats are held in advance and, as with the National Eisteddfod, the Urdd Eisteddfod is held in a different location each year. With the establishment of the Urdd headquarters in the Wales Millennium Centre, the eisteddfod will return to Cardiff every four years.

==== The International Eisteddfod ====
The International Eisteddfod is held annually in Llangollen, Denbighshire, each year in July. Choirs, singing groups, folk dancers and other groups attend from all over the world, sharing their national folk traditions in one of the world&#x27;s great festivals of the arts. It was set up in 1947 and begins with a message of peace. In 2004, it was (unsuccessfully) nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Terry Waite, who has been actively involved with the eisteddfod.

==== Other eisteddfodau in Wales ====
Smaller-scale local eisteddfodau are held throughout Wales. One of the best known is the Maes Garmon Eisteddfod, Mold (). Schools hold eisteddfodau as competitions within the school; a popular date for this is Saint David&#x27;s Day.

==Eisteddfodau outside Wales ==
Welsh emigration, particularly during the heyday of the British Empire and British industrial revolution, led to the creation of a global Welsh diaspora. Among the elements from Welsh culture that travelled with these émigrés was the eisteddfod, which – in a variety of forms and languages – continues to exist worldwide.

===Argentina===
According to Marcus Tanner, the massive 19th-century Welsh immigration to &quot;Y Wladfa&quot; (&quot;the Colony&quot;), in the Chubut Province of Argentine Patagonia began out of the desire of minister and Welsh nationalist Michael D. Jones for &quot;a Little Wales beyond Wales&quot;. As both cultural assimilation and language loss were already taking hold among the Welsh diaspora throughout the United States and even more so in Canada and other parts of the British Empire, Patagonia was chosen as an alternative.

While visiting Puerto Madryn, the main arrival point for immigrants, during the mid-1970s, Bruce Chatwin wrote, &quot;A hundred and fifty-three Welsh colonists landed here off the brig &quot;Mimosa&quot; in 1865. They were poor people in search of a New Wales, refugees from cramped coal-mining valleys, from a failed independence movement, and from Parliament&#x27;s ban on Welsh in schools. Their leaders had combed the earth for a stretch of open country uncontaminated by Englishmen. They chose Patagonia for its absolute remoteness and foul climate; they did not want to get rich. The Argentine Government gave them land along the Chubut River (). From Madryn it was a stretch of forty miles over the thorn desert. And when they did reach the valley, they had the impression that God, not the Government, had given them the land.&quot;

Although eisteddfodau have been held in Argentina ever since the first Welsh immigrants arrived aboard the &quot;Mimosa&quot; in 1865, assimilation and the loss of contact with the homeland caused both the distinctive Patagonian dialect of the Welsh language and the eisteddfod tradition to be seriously endangered.

In 1965, Welsh people again began to visit the region to celebrate the colony&#x27;s centenary. The visit acted as a major impetus to the increasingly assimilated local Welsh Argentine community and since then the number of Welsh visitors and learners of the language has increased.

Bruce Chatwin visited Gaiman in 1976, which he called &quot;the centre of Welsh Patagonia today&quot;. While at , the homestead of the Davies family, he was told how the family&#x27;s son, Euan Davies, had sung at the local eisteddfod while accompanied by Anselmo, a local aspiring concert pianist of mixed German and Italian parentage. Davies&#x27; tenor voice and Anselmo&#x27;s piano playing reportedly reduced the audience at the eisteddfod to tears and &quot;carried off the prize.&quot;

Marcus Tanner has written since of Chatwin&#x27;s travel memoir &quot;In Patagonia&quot;, &quot;After several decades during which the Welsh colony in Argentina had been virtually forgotten, his book did much to remind the world of its existence.&quot; According to Eluned Gonzalez, however, a local Welsh Argentine who remembers the real Chatwin and his visit, &quot;We are all very surprised by the book... so superior. Looking down on us... a very &quot;English&quot; way of looking at things.&quot;

During the British government&#x27;s repatriation of the 11,313 Argentine POWs taken during the 1982 Falklands War, Welsh-speaking British merchant seamen and British soldiers from the Welsh Guards were shocked to find themselves addressed in Patagonian Welsh by an Argentine POW who was on the way home to Puerto Madryn. Over the years since, close ties between Wales and have been reestablished.

One of the greatest Welsh literary figures to come out of was Richard Bryn Williams, whose bardic name was &quot;Bryn&quot;. Williams was born at Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd in 1902. When he was seven years old, Williams&#x27; family migrated to Trelew, as part of the last great wave of Welsh immigration to prior to the First World War. Williams returned to Wales in 1923 and studied at the University College of North Wales. He became an expert on Patagonian history and was a major contributor to the Colony&#x27;s Welsh literature. Williams won the Bardic Chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in both 1964 and 1968, and from 1975 to 1978 he served as Archdruid of the Gorsedd Cymru.

A 2001 BBC article described in detail the recent visit to Chubut Province by Archdruid and 30 members of the &quot;Gorsedd Cymru&quot; to revive the in a ceremony held in a specially constructed stone circle near Gaiman.

BBC reporters also attended the 2001 at Trelew and watched as the bardic chair was awarded for the first time in to a female poet: Gaiman hotel owner Monica Jones de Jones, for an on the subject of (&#x27;freedom&#x27;). The article&#x27;s author continued, &quot;the Patagonia Eisteddfod itself, while sharing those elements common to eisteddfodau in Wales itself, nonetheless is, in other respects, quite a different affair. As well as haunting Welsh folk tunes, and recitations in the unique Spanish-accented Welsh of the Patagonians, there are also rousing displays of Argentinian folk dancing which owe everything to the culture of the gauchos and nothing to the somewhat tamer dance routines of the Welsh homeland.&quot;

While visiting Patagonia to research his 2004 book &quot;The Last of the Celts&quot;, Marcus Tanner visited the Trelew home of local Welsh-language poet Geraint Edmunds. Edmunds was, according to Tanner, &quot;a Welsh Patagonian of the old type, as fluent in Welsh as Spanish&quot;. During Tanner&#x27;s visit, he noticed that &quot;a beautifully made Bardic Chair&quot;, which Geraint Edmunds&#x27; poetry had won was on reverent display in the front room. To Tanner&#x27;s disappointment, however, the bard&#x27;s son, Eduardo Edmunds, would speak only Spanish and replied when asked about his ancestral language, &quot;I think I&#x27;d rather learn English – more useful.&quot;

Since Welsh devolution, however, the Welsh Parliament in Cardiff has provided both funding and teachers to joint Welsh-Spanish immersion schools, such as Ysgol yr Hendre, in Chubut Province.

Current eisteddfod competitions are bilingual, in both Patagonian Welsh and Argentine Spanish, and include poetry, prose, literary translations (Welsh, Spanish, English, Italian, and French), musical performances, arts, folk dances, photography, and filmmaking, among others. The is held every September at Gaiman. The main is held every October at Trelew. Other annual eisteddfodau are held at Trevelin, in the Andes and at Puerto Madryn along the South Atlantic coast.

=== Australia ===
Eisteddfods (Australian English: plural) in the traditional Welsh sense have also been adopted into Australian culture. However, the term is more commonly used to describe ballet and music competitions.

For those eisteddfods most like the Welsh original, they involve testing individuals in singing, dancing, acting and musicianship.

After emigrating to Australia from Tregaron, Ceredigion, at the tail end of the Victorian gold rush, Welsh poet and diarist Joseph Jenkins, whose bardic name was Amnon II, arrived at Melbourne in 1869. The following month, as described in his posthumously published memoir &quot;The Diary of a Welsh Swagman&quot;, Jenkins was living in the gold rush boomtown of Castlemaine where he found many fellow Welsh Australians. He rarely left this vicinity except to attend the annual St David&#x27;s Day &quot;eisteddfod&quot; at Ballarat where, on thirteen consecutive occasions, he was awarded first prize for the best &quot;englyn&quot;.

The successor to the St. David&#x27;s Day Eisteddfod in Ballarat, the Royal South Street Eisteddfod, began in 1891 and has been running ever since.

The second-oldest eisteddfod in Australia is located in Wollongong, the City of Wollongong Eisteddfod, which began in 1894 and has been running ever since.

The Sydney Eisteddfod was first held in 1933 and offers some 400 events across all performing arts, catering to 30,000 performers annually.

Modern eisteddfods in Australia are competitions reserved for schoolchildren, though many have open sections where anyone (including professionals) may participate and compete. Typically, a prize may be a scholarship to pursue a further career. Many young Australian actors and dancers participate regularly in the various competitions scheduled throughout the year. The Western Australia Performing Arts Eisteddfod began in 1958 as the Bunbury Music Festival. The Gold Coast Eisteddfod in Queensland began in 1982 and is held annually in August and September. The 2018 eisteddfod attracted over 60,000 competitors. Many other communities also host eisteddfods, including Alice Springs, Darwin, Brisbane, Hobart and Melbourne.

===Channel Islands===
The Guernsey Eisteddfod was founded in 1922 and includes events in the Guernésiais language; the Jersey Eisteddfod was founded in 1908 and includes events in Jèrriais dialect of Norman French.

===England===
Eisteddfodau are held across the UK, although in most cases any explicit link to Welsh culture has been lost beyond the use of the name for an arts festival or competition.

In 1897 a Forest of Dean Eisteddfod, reportedly a choral competition, was founded at Cinderford.

In the Methodist Church and other non-conformist denominations in England, youth cultural festivals are sometimes called eisteddfod. The Kettering and District Eisteddfod, for example, was founded in the early 1900s in the Northamptonshire town by members of the Sunday School Union and still runs every March.

The Bristol Festival of Music, Speech and Drama was founded in 1903 as the Bristol Eisteddfod.

The Minsterley Eisteddfod has been held every March in South Shropshire since 1962.

The Teesside International Eisteddfod (Intertie) in Middlesbrough ran from 1966 to 1978.

For many years Teignmouth Grammar School in Teignmouth, Devonshire, held an eisteddfod of art, music and drama competitions in the Easter term.

=== South Africa ===
In South African English, a number of international performing arts competitions in are called eisteddfods, such as the Tygerberg International Eisteddfod and the Pretoria Eisteddfod (first held in 1923). The word &quot;eisteddfod&quot; is sometimes also used for ordinary cultural festivals, even if only one school&#x27;s students participate.

In August 1953, the poet Ingrid Jonker, who would go on to become an anti-apartheid political dissident and a hugely influential figure in Afrikaans literature, recited her poems at the Cape Eisteddfod in Cape Town and received there a Diploma for Achievement in Afrikaans.

===United States===
Moving first as religious refugees and then as farmers and industrial workers, many thousands of Welsh people emigrated to America from the 17th century.

In 1757, Reverend Goronwy Owen, an Anglican vicar born at &quot;Y Dafarn Goch&quot;, in the parish of Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf in Anglesey and the poet most responsible for the subsequent Welsh eighteenth-century renaissance, emigrated to Williamsburg, in the Colony of Virginia. Until his death on his cotton and tobacco plantation near Lawrenceville, Virginia in 1769, Owen was mostly noted as an émigré bard, writing with &quot;hiraeth&quot; (&#x27;longing&#x27;) for his native Anglesey. During the subsequent revival of the eisteddfod, the Gwyneddigion Society held up the poetry of Owen as an example for bards at future eisteddfodau to emulate.

During the eisteddfod revival of the 1790s, Gwyneddigion Society member William Jones, who had enthusiastically supported the American Revolution and who was arguing for the creation of a National Eisteddfod of Wales, had come to believe that the completely Anglicized Welsh nobility, through rackrenting and their employment of unscrupulous land agents, had forfeited all right to the obedience and respect of their tenants. At the Llanrwst eisteddfod in June 1791, Jones distributed copies of an address, entitled &quot;To all Indigenous Cambro-Britons&quot;, in which he urged Welsh tenant farmers and craftsmen to pack their bags, emigrate from Wales, and sail for what he called the &quot;Promised Land&quot; in the United States of America.

By 1851, (&#x27;The Mirror&#x27;), published from the Welsh-speaking settlement in Utica, New York was just the latest of a number of Welsh-language newspapers, and in 1872 (&#x27;A history of the Welsh in America&#x27;) by R.D. Thomas attempted to catalogue all of the Welsh communities of the United States. Eisteddfodau in North America are thought to have started in the 1830s, though the earliest documented examples date from the 1840s and, especially, the 1850s. Efforts to introduce the Gorsedd into the United States, on the other hand, were less successful and never attracted more than 303 members.

According to Celticist Gethin Matthews, &quot;Next to the chapels, the Eisteddfod was the most potent symbol of Welsh exceptionalism in America. As such, the success of each locality&#x27;s eisteddfod became a status symbol within the diaspora: something to boast about in the pages of &quot;Y Drych&quot;, or one of the other periodicals ... There is also a strong link between the eisteddfod tradition and the printed word, with thirty-three publications (from 8 to 464 pages in length) being the fruit of such festivals. Although most of them were published in Utica (which became the hub of the Welsh-American publishing business), they represent the output of eisteddfodau in a wide range of location, including settlements far from the eastern seaboard such as Racine, Denver, and San Francisco.&quot;

====Pennsylvania====
According to Marcus Tanner, large-scale Welsh immigration to America began in the 1790s, when 50 immigrants left the village of Llanbrynmair for a tract of Pennsylvania land purchased by Baptist minister Morgan John Rhys. The result was the Welsh-American farming settlement of Cambria, Pennsylvania.

By 1913, a sub-gorsedd of North America with a vice-Archdruid, Reverend Thomas Edwards whose bardic name was Cynonfardd, was established at the Pittsburgh Eisteddfod, surviving until 1946.

The Edwardsville Cynonfardd Eisteddfod at the Dr. Edwards Memorial Church in Edwardsville, Pennsylvania has taken place annually since 1889 and is the longest continuously running eisteddfod outside of Wales. The 130th anniversary of the event was celebrated in April 2019.

====Ohio====
Welsh-American settlements in Ohio began in 1801, when a group of Welsh-speaking pioneers migrated from Cambria, Pennsylvania to Paddy&#x27;s Run, which is now the site of Shandon, Ohio.

According to Marcus Tanner, &quot;In Ohio State, Jackson and Gallia counties in particular became a &#x27;Little Wales&#x27;, where Welsh settlers were sufficiently thick on the ground by the 1830s to justify the establishment of Calvinistic Methodist synods.&quot;

As late as 1900, Ohio still had 150 Welsh-speaking church congregations. The Welsh language was commonly spoken there for generations until the 1950s when its use began to subside. As of 2010, more than 126,000 Ohioans are of Welsh descent and about 135 speak the language, with significant concentrations still found in many communities of Ohio such as Oak Hill (13.6%), Madison (12.7%), Franklin (10.5%), Jackson (10.0%), Radnor (9.8%), and Jefferson (9.7%).
The Jackson School Eisteddfod in Jackson, Ohio, is the result of an historically strong Welsh-American business community, who funded the Southern Ohio Eisteddfod Association and a 4,000-seat auditorium that was the only dedicated eisteddfod venue in the United States. In 1930, the hall hosted the Grand National Eisteddfod. While the Great Depression halted the adult events, a youth eisteddfod, founded in 1924, still runs today, with support from the Madog Center for Welsh Studies at University of Rio Grande.

====Minnesota====
After the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux was signed by the Dakota people in 1851, Welsh-speaking pioneers from Wisconsin, Upstate New York, and Ohio settled much of what is now Le Sueur and Blue Earth counties in Minnesota. By 1857, the number of Welsh-speakers was so numerous that the Minnesota State Constitution had to be translated into the Welsh language. With such a large number of settlers, it should come as no surprise that eisteddfodau soon followed.

Local Welsh-language poet James Price, whose bardic name was (&#x27;Son of David&#x27;), was born at Newark, Ohio to parents from Llanon, Ceredigion. After migrating to the Minnesota frontier, Ap Dewi served as a deacon and Sunday school teacher at the Horeb Calvinistic Methodist Church in Cambria Township, Blue Earth County and was so dominant at local eisteddfodau that he was considered the &quot; of Minnesota.&quot;

The first Welsh literary society in Minnesota was founded, according to Ap Dewi, at a meeting held in South Bend Township, also in Blue Earth County in the fall of 1855. Also according to Ap Dewi, &quot;The first eisteddfod in the state of Minnesota was held in Judson in the house of Wm. C. Williams in 1864. The second eisteddfod was held in Judson in the log chapel in 1866 with the Rev. John Roberts as chairman. Ellis E. Ellis, Robert E. Hughes, H.H. Hughes, Rev. J. Jenkins, and William R. Jones took part in this eisteddfod. The third eisteddfod was held in Judson in the new chapel (Jerusalem) on January 2, 1871. The famous Llew Llwyfo (bardic name) was chairman and a splendid time was had.&quot;

According to David M. Jones, a Calvinistic Methodist minister born at Ty Rhedyn, near Marian-glas, Anglesey and Welsh-language writer whose literary talents drew comparisons with Washington Irving, the first eisteddfod held in Cambria Township took place on the Fourth of July, 1871. A &quot;low-lying site behind the house of John Shields&quot; was chosen for the Maes and, as Jones later recalled, &quot;We cut tiers of seats into a natural bank of land and covered the seats with hay. These were the first seats with cushions we had ever seen in Minnesota, and everyone praised them. We built a platform in front of the seats. There was a clear stream running between the platform and the seats. All of us felt that our fine preparations would ensure the success of the program. On the morning of the Fourth, everyone was ready long before the Minnesota sun appeared. In a little while, there were clouds of dust being stirred up by large wagons coming from every direction. The immense prairie was dotted with wagons drawn by horses, mules, and horned oxen. Long before the time, the seats were full.&quot;

Ellis Ellis, a Mankato joiner from Aberdyfi, Merionethshire and whose bardic name was Glan Dyfi (after the village of the same name), was, according to Jones, &quot;the adjudicator for the poetry, and it is more than likely that Ap Dewi won the prize. What the subject was, we do not recall, though it is likely that there was a subject. Not often did a Bard compose without a subject. Evan Evans, Daniel Jones, and W.P. Jones must have competed in the essay competition, adjudicated by the cultured David S. Davies. In the humorous address competition, Evan Evans and Henry Hughes were both winners. There were various recitations by Owen Morris and Thomas Hughes, who were masterly as usual, among others. John S. Davies and his group sang several pieces, and the singers of Bethel also took part. Owen Richards and his brother, Tomy Richards, took part in the first eisteddfod. Johnnie Jones from the same district turned out to be skillful at recitation. Before the end of the last meeting one of the Minnesota storms came on, and the audience scattered in a moment.&quot;

According to Ap Dewi, local eisteddfodau began being held in the county seat of Mankato on 1 January 1873, when one took place at the Blue Earth County Courthouse.

During the same era, a group of Welsh-language poets used to meet regularly under the leadership of Ellis Ellis (Glan Dyfi) at the Cheshire and Jones Shop in Mankato, where the packing paper in the shop was often used to write down in Welsh.

David Jones later expressed a belief that the composed at the Cheshire and Jones Shop were superior to those of far more famous Welsh poets such as Dewi Wyn, Dewi Havhesp, and Dyfed. Jones further recalled, &quot;Glan Dyfi never had any more enjoyment than when tinkering with the elements of , tossing off so many while taking no notice of the rules of Dafydd ab Edmwnd or any other Dafydd. O! To have those old times back again.&quot;

Beginning in 1874, eisteddfodau were held annually at the Union Hall in Mankato until 1876, when the custom fell into abeyance until 1890. The 1890 eisteddfod was held on 5 February at the Mankato Opera House, under the leadership of Thomas Hughes and continued there.

By the 1880s between 2,500 and 3,000 people of Welsh background in Minnesota were contributing to the life of some 17 churches and 22 chapels.

The first eisteddfod held in the Twin Cities took place, &quot;on a fairly large scale&quot;, and sponsored by the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist chapel on Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis, on 17 January 1885.

A second Minneapolis eisteddfod was held, with the participation of adjudicators and contestants from St. Paul, Minnesota, Lime Springs, Iowa, and Cambria, Wisconsin, on Christmas Day, 1888.

A third Minneapolis eisteddfod was held, under the patronage of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist chapel and , the Welsh literary society of Minneapolis, on St. David&#x27;s Day, 1894. Adjudicated contests were held for essays, recitations, poetry, literary translations, and performances.

According to a 2006 article in the &quot;Mankato Free Press&quot; the custom of local eisteddfodau went into abeyance during the 1950s. An effort was made, however, during the early 21st century, to revive the tradition by the Blue Earth County Historical Society and the Mankato Chapter of the League of Minnesota Poets. During the 2006 Cambria eisteddfod at the Morgan Creek Vineyards in New Ulm, Brainerd poet Doris Stengel was awarded the bardic chair by adjudicator John Calvin Rezmerski.

But, following Rezmerski&#x27;s death in 2016, the custom of local eisteddfodau again fell into abeyance.

====American Civil War====
Competitive eisteddfod were held during the American Civil War, with themes including George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, American patriotism, and Jefferson Davis.

Also during the American Civil War, Edward Thomas, a Welsh-language poet born in Centerville, Ohio to parents from Llanidloes and whose bardic name was Awenydd, was living and working as a schoolmaster at the Welsh-American farming settlement at South Bend Township, in Blue Earth County, Minnesota. In 1862, he enlisted in Company E of the 2nd Minnesota Cavalry Regiment. During his service in that regiment, Thomas wrote many Welsh-language poems, including , which later won the bardic crown at an eisteddfod held in Minersville, Pennsylvania. Following the end of the war, Thomas became a Calvinistic Methodist minister.

====Illinois====
Mrs. Jennie A. Ingalls, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. H.O. Roberts of Minneapolis, won a prize for best recitation at an 1890 eisteddfod held in Chicago, Illinois.

The largest U.S. eisteddfod was held in 1893 at the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago, featuring visiting Welsh choirs invited by the Chicago chapter of the Cymmrodorion Society. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, which then included a large number of Welsh immigrants, made its first appearance outside of Utah at the same event. At the same eisteddfod, Reverend Evan Reese, a Calvinistic Methodist minister from Puncheston, Pembrokeshire, and Welsh poet whose bardic name was Dyfed, won the bardic chair and the $500 prize money offered for a 2,000 line on the set subject (&#x27;Jesus of Nazareth&#x27;). Reese went on to become the Archdruid of the &quot;Gorsedd Cymru&quot; and to announce the posthumous victory of Hedd Wyn at the infamous 1917 Eisteddfod of the Black Chair.

The eisteddfod idea has been retained by some subsequent world&#x27;s fairs, and has helped to link the Welsh eisteddfod community to its Welsh-American offshoot.

====California====
The first Eisteddfod in the State of California was organized by Thomas Gwallter Price, whose Bardic name was &quot;Cuhelyn&quot;, and took place in North San Juan on July 4th, 1860.

On 28 July 1915, the International Eisteddfod held in San Francisco at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition drew competing choirs from around the nation, including one mixed group composed of the German members of the Metropolitan Opera Chorus from New York City The tightly rehearsed, all-male Orpheus Club of Los Angeles were judged the winner and were awarded $3,000.

In 1926, the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California, held a competitive eisteddfod of one-act plays by local authors that subsequently evolved into an annual Summer One-Act Play Festival.

The 2011 West Coast Eisteddfod event was co-curated by Lorin Morgan-Richards and held at the Barnsdall Art Park in Los Angeles, the site of Welsh-American architect Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Hollyhock House, near Griffith Park, founded by Welsh-American philanthropist Griffith J. Griffith.

From 1925 to 2016, the Los Angeles St. David&#x27;s Day Festival was the largest Welsh-American cultural event in the United States. It included an eisteddfod, a Celtic marketplace, classes, and a concert. Celebrities of Welsh heritage Henry Thomas, Ioan Gruffudd, Michael Sheen, along with Richard Burton&#x27;s and Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s families have all publicly supported the festival.

====Oregon====
The West Coast Eisteddfod (originally the Left Coast Eisteddfod) was founded by Welsh-American social network AmeriCymru and the non-profit Portland, Oregon, Meriwether Lewis Memorial Eisteddfod Foundation in 2009.

====Welsh Heritage Week====
Welsh Heritage Week and , two ambulatory Welsh language and culture courses held annually, usually in the United States, also each feature a mini-eisteddfod. The North American Festival of Wales held by the Welsh North American Association also includes an eisteddfod.

====Online====
In the 21st century the internet and social media helped new eisteddfodau to spring up. For example, AmeriCymru hosts an annual online eisteddfod.

== Similar events in other Celtic cultures ==
Various festivals in other Celtic cultures have similarities to eisteddfodau.

===Brittany===
According to Marcus Tanner, even though the Breton people have never faced the dire poverty or mass starvation once commonly risked among Irish language speakers, efforts to preserve the Breton language and its literature have traditionally faced an antagonist with a radically different political ideology than speakers of Celtic languages in the British Isles. Since the 1789 French Revolution and Reign of Terror, mainstream republicanism in France has embraced policies of Secularisation, centralizing government power in Paris, and coercive Francization through the State-controlled educational system.

Despite its long history of hostility to religious practice, Marcus Tanner has written that traditional French republicanism is ironically &quot;a Messianic ideology&quot;. In an early 21st century interview with Marcus Tanner, explained that post-1789 French Governments have successfully sold the French language as, &quot;the language of progress&quot; and have taught minority language speakers that, &quot;All others were the languages of the Church and the nobility. Children were taught that Breton was the language of poverty and the past. Even recently I have interviewed people who recalled their shame at school for knowing Breton.&quot;

In contrast, ever since Pope Gregory XI issued the &quot;règle d&#x27;idiom&quot; (&quot;the rule of idiom&quot;) in 1373, Roman Catholic clergy were commanded to learn how to preach to and communicate with their flocks in the vernacular. This is also why, ever since the French Revolution, the traditional proverb in the Breton language () (&quot;Breton and [the] Faith are brother and sister in Brittany&quot;), was once commonly quoted.

Believers in Breton cultural nationalism have, for these reasons, often been dissidents who criticized or opposed at least some elements of French Republican ideology. This is also why efforts to introduce a form of the Eisteddfod into the Breton language revival date from the immediate aftermath of the Revolution.

Even though the neo-bardic, Gorsedd, and Eisteddfod movement in Brittany was founded during the early 19th century by Auguste Brizeux, the real heyday of the movement took place between 1900 and the outbreak of the First World War. Those two decades were dominated by François Jaffrenou, whose bardic name was Taldir, and who introduced many Iolo Morganwg-inspired elements of Welsh culture into Breton culture and literature. During those decades, Taldir founded the Gorsedd Barzed Gourenez Breiz Isel (The Gorsedd of Bards of the Peninsula of Brittany) and did much to encourage both traditional Celtic poetry and a sense of community among Breton Bards.

In 1936, Morvan Marchal founded the explicitly anti-Christian and neo-Pagan &quot;Kredenn Geltiek Hollvedel&quot; (World Celtic Creed) group, of which he became the first arch-Druid. The group broke openly from the Goursez Vreizh.

Meanwhile, following the Liberation of France, the Government of the newly founded Fourth French Republic launched a propaganda campaign that still continues. It attempted to discredit all activism in favor of Breton cultural and language revival, political devolution, and Breton-medium education by depicting it as synonymous with treason and collaboration with Nazism. This has proven to be far from successful.

Pêr-Jakez Helias, who was both a World War II veteran of the French Resistance and a major figure in Breton literature, later recalled in his memoirs the massive public backlash and roots revival this provoked and his own role in it, &quot;As soon as World War II ended, &#x27;Celtic Clubs&#x27; were being founded everywhere in Brittany, but especially in the Breton-speaking regions. The members were young people whose objective was to bring the peasant tradition, with all its costumes, its dances, and its games back into esteem. Within ten years several hundred of these groups had been organized. At the same time, thanks to the persistence of a few pioneers, other young people began to take lessons from the last of the professional bagpipers and oboeists, who were ending their lives in a state of melancholy... Think of thousands of young people involved in traditional art forms at a time when their traditions were both alive and threatened, perhaps even doomed, and faced with a new society which they couldn&#x27;t count on in any way. How could they possibly not have protested?&quot;

Since 1923, the &quot;Festival de Cornouaille&quot; (Breton: ) has taken place annually in Quimper, located in the south-west of Brittany. It began as a beauty contest during which one girl was crowned as festival queen, which drew firm objections from the Catholic Church during its post-World War II revival in 1948. The &quot;Cornouaille Kemper&quot; was accordingly transformed by Pêr-Jakez Helias, François Bégot and Jo Halleguen into an Eisteddfod-inspired summer festival celebrating Breton culture, mythology, literature, and traditional music.

The similar competition, which is held as part of the Festival Interceltique de Lorient, supports the Breton music tradition.

The &quot;AberFest&quot; in Cornwall alternates with the &quot;Breizh – Kernow Festival&quot; which is held either in Brandivy or Bignan in Brittany.

===Cornwall===

In Cornwall, an analogous event is known as (Cornish for &#x27;Eisteddfod of Cornwall&#x27;) and is connected, as part of the ongoing Cornish language revival, with the &quot;Gorsedh Kernow&quot;.

&quot;AberFest&quot; is a festival that celebrates both Cornish and Breton culture and takes place in Cornwall every second year around Easter.

A similar tradition has been created among descendants of the Cornish diaspora in Australia. &quot;Australia&#x27;s Little Cornwall&quot; is the district of the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia known as the Copper Triangle, which includes the former mining towns of Moonta, Kadina and Wallaroo. In Moonta today, the &quot;Kernewek Lowender&quot; (Cornish for &#x27;Cornish Happiness&#x27;), which includes an eisteddfod-like gathering of bards, is the largest Cornish festival in the world and attracts more than 40,000 visitors each event. The Cornish language revival has also spread to the Cornish diaspora and is spoken by some enthusiasts in Australia. Senior members of the Gorsedh Kernow make frequent visits to Australia, and there are a number of Cornish Australian bards.

===Ireland===

During the days of Gaelic Ireland and of the Irish clans, there was a tradition similar to the first eisteddfodau. Irish clan chiefs would host feasts for their clansmen, servants, and warriors which centered around a contest between Irish-language bards, whose poetry was performed by professional singers accompanied by a harp. As in 12th-century Wales, the clan chief always chose the winner with the approval of those assembled. This tradition, which arose during the 14th century, was termed a &quot;Gairm Sgoile&quot; (Early Modern Irish: &#x27;summoning&#x27;, or &#x27;gathering&#x27;, &#x27;of the [Bardic] school&#x27;).

This title referred to the fact that Irish language bards were trained in the dark at special bardic schools () based on the principle of memorization of Irish bardic poetry and stories about the deities of Irish mythology. Irish bards and their students were expected to compose their verses lying down and in the dark, &quot;to avoid the distraction which light and the variety of objects represented commonly occasions&quot; and to concentrate solely, &quot;upon the subject at hand and the theme given&quot;.

The most famous gathering of the bardic school took place on Christmas Day, 1351. William Ua Cellaig, Chief of the Name and King of Uí Maine in Connacht, held, like Prince Rhys ap Gruffydd, a great competition and feast for the bards of Ireland. An entire temporary village was erected with separate streets for musicians, &quot;seanchaithe&quot;, poets, and jugglers.

The traditional Connacht Irish phrase, &quot;Fáilte Uí Cheallaigh&quot; (&quot;An O&#x27;Kelly Welcome&quot;) dates from this event, which was held at Gailey Castle along Lough Ree, near what is now Knockcroghery, County Roscommon. The feast reportedly lasted for a month. It was during this feast that the poet, Gofraidh Fionn Ó Dálaigh, wrote the poem, &quot;Filidh Éireann go hAointeach&quot;, which remembers the feast.

After the 16th and 17th century dispossession, emigration, and outlawry of the Irish clan chiefs and the loss of their patronage, the teachers and former students of the bardic schools were forced to adapt.

According to Vivian Mercier, &quot;It is not enough to say that the Gaelic-speaking aristocracy were dispossessed of their lands: the poets themselves were landholders, a sort of &quot;Noblesse de robe&quot;, whose dispossession accompanied or followed that of the &quot;Noblesse d&#x27;épée&quot;. The overthrow of the bardic institution was accompanied by a change in poetic technique which enables one to judge with considerable accuracy whether a given poem belongs to the bardic period or not: syllabic metre (&quot;dán díreach&quot;) gives way to stress or song metre (&quot;amhrán&quot;). This change reflects not only the gradual disappearance of the bardic schools but also of the bardic audience; most authorities believe that the stress metres had been common among the common people for a long time before poems in those metres were granted the dignity of being committed to manuscript. If the dispossessed and often starving poet wanted the favour of his new patrons - those who were only less poor than he - he must cater to their tastes.&quot;

The bards overwhelmingly adapted, according to Daniel Corkery, by becoming teachers at the hedge schools in Irish villages.

Meanwhile, in 18th-century Munster, the custom arose, in what was both mimicry and satire of the ceremonial of the English-dominated legal and court system, of the local chief-bard presiding over sessions of a , or poetic court. A would begin with &quot;bailiffs&quot; delivering often humorously worded &quot;warrants&quot; which summoned local Irish-language poets to a bardic competition presided over by the chief-bard as &quot;judge&quot;. In many cases, two poets at the would engage in flyting (Classical Gaelic: &quot;immarbág&quot;) () (lit. &quot;counter-boasting&quot;), meaning the trading of insults in verse often improvised on the spot. According to Corkery, much of the serious, improvised, and comic poetry in the Irish language composed for sessions of the Munster poetic courts was written down by the court &quot;recorders&quot; and still survives. At the beginning of his term, the Chief-Poet of a district, similarly to an Irish clan chief, would receive a Staff of Office (), which would later be handed down to his successor.

Also according to Corkery, the patronage of Bardic and musical contests also continued among the very few remaining families from the Gaelic nobility of Ireland; like the O&#x27;Connell family of Derrynane House in County Kerry and the MacDermot Princes of Coolavin in County Sligo, who continued to hold at least a part of their ancestral lands, while ruling over their tenants and servants as the Chief of the Name.

At least for a time, some Anglo-Irish landlords hosted similar contests. During the early 18th century, Irish-language poet, composer, and itinerant harpist Turlough O&#x27;Carolan is said to have improvised &quot;Carolan&#x27;s Concerto&quot; inside the house of the Anglo-Irish Power family, during such a contest against the Italian violinist Francesco Geminiani. According to other versions of the story, the contest that resulted in the impromptu composition of &quot;Carolan&#x27;s Concerto&quot; took place at the home of Church of Ireland clergyman, poet, and satirist Jonathan Swift.

Since it was founded as part of the Gaelic revival by Conradh na Gaeilge in 1897, the eisteddfod-inspired festival known as Oireachtas na Gaeilge was envisaged to spearhead a renaissance of Irish-language literature, culture, and the arts.

In contrast to today&#x27;s Oireachtas, there was more emphasis on Modern literature in Irish than upon Irish traditional music or the performing arts. There were two competitions for Irish poetry, five for Irish language essays, one for best poetry collection; a competition for unpublished songs or short stories in Irish; a competition for best new song composition, and a recitation competition.

The early organizers of Oireachtas pulled off several major accomplishments, such as the first staging of Robert O&#x27;Dwyer&#x27;s &quot;Eithne&quot;, the first Irish-language opera, in 1909. Even so, the popularity of Oireachtas waned following the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Irish Civil War, and the festival was repeatedly cancelled during the 1920s and 1930s.

The festival was traditionally held in Dublin, but, beginning in 1974, Coiste Cearta Síbialta na Gaeilge (English: Irish Language Civil Rights Committee&quot;) successfully coerced an end to the practice of never holding Oireachtas in Ireland&#x27;s Gaeltacht areas.

Oireachtas currently culminates in four major competitions over the weekend: Comórtas na mBan, a sean-nós singing competition for women, Comórtas na bhFear, a similar one for men, and Corn Uí Riada, one for both genders and all ages. There is also the Comórtas Damhsa ar an Sean Nós (&quot;Steip&quot;), a Sean-nós dance competition mainly based on the Connemara stepdancing style now popular throughout the country, but also including dancing in other regional styles.

The organisers, under the Directorship of Liam Ó Maolaodha have attempted from the 1990s on to market Oireachtas to millennial Irish speakers via outings, discos, and other youth-oriented events.

Since it was also founded by Conradh na Gaeilge in 1902, &quot;Seachtain na Gaeilge&quot; (English: Irish Language Week), which is similarly based upon the Welsh eisteddfod, has celebrated Irish traditional music, Gaelic games, and Irish culture.

The festival begins each year on St David&#x27;s Day and ends on St Patrick&#x27;s Day, with community-organised events celebrated all over Ireland and the world, such as céilís, concerts, quizzes, competitions and parades. Like the first documented 12th-century eisteddfod, the 14th-century and the 18th-century Munster , includes a contest between Irish poets in the Irish language.

The Fleadh Cheoil is an annual festival for Irish traditional music that takes place in the same town for a few years in a row, before moving to another area of Ireland in an effort to include all localities in the celebration.

After the end of the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Civil War, the 1924-1937 revival of the ancient Tailteann Games also emulated the Welsh Eisteddfod by including ceremonies in Pre-Christian Irish clothing and inspired by Irish mythology.

There is also the event known as &quot;Imram&quot;, which was founded in 2004 by Liam Carson, who had noticed that there was no literary festival dedicated to Irish literature in the Irish language. In response, Carson received funding from Poetry Ireland, Dublin City Council, and &quot;Foras na Gaeilge&quot;. According to Carson, &quot;The festival name means ‘a voyage of discovery’ and what we’re asking people to do is come with us and discover the Irish language.&quot;

===Isle of Man===
Unlike in other Celtic nations, the Eisteddfod in the Isle of Man has much less to do with the ongoing revival efforts spearheaded by Brian Stowell, Robert Corteen Carswell, &quot;Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh&quot;, and the Bunscoill Ghaelgagh, for the island&#x27;s heritage language of Manx Gaelic, its literature, and its culture. Even so, an Eisteddfod has been held since the Great Depression in Braaid and remains a highly anticipated and widely attended event by the Manx people.

For players and enthusiasts of Gaelic and Manx traditional music and dancing, there is also the Shennaghys Jiu (&quot;Traditional Day&quot;) festival. A closer parallel to the Eisteddfod is the annual Cooish festival held since 1996 in Peel, Isle of Man.

===Scotland===

The Scottish Gaelic &quot;mòd&quot;, a festival of Scottish Gaelic song, literature, arts and culture, is modeled upon the Welsh eisteddfod. The , however, is different in that it lacks the 12th-century roots or the fictitious rituals introduced by Iolo Morganwg.

Similarly to the Welsh word &quot;eisteddfod&quot;, the Gaelic word , which derives from the Old Norse word , refers to a Viking Age &quot;Thing&quot; or a gathering of Scottish clans. In the Highlands and Islands, however, the term originally referred to the Council of the Isles, Scottish clan chiefs who advised Somerled and his successors among as Lords of the Isles. Finlaggan on Islay was the usual site for the gathering of the Council of the Isles.

Similar to the Eisteddfod and other Celtic festivals, the mòd was founded in response to colonialism and in an effort to preserve an increasingly endangered language from the coercive Anglicisation of the educational system.

According to Marcus Tanner, the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge was incorporated under Queen Anne in 1709 and began building both schools and libraries in the Scottish Highlands and Islands with a twofold purpose. The first purpose was to prevent the Gaels from returning to the still illegal and underground Catholic Church in Scotland. The second was to ensure, &quot;that in process of time Britons from North to South may speak the same language&quot;. For this reason, all schoolmasters were under orders to teach their students only in English and to subject any student who spoke Gaelic inside the school or on the playground to flogging.

Under the 1872 Education Act, school attendance was compulsory and only English was taught or tolerated in the schools of both the Lowlands and the Highlands and Islands. As a result, any student who spoke Scots or Scottish Gaelic in the school or on its grounds could expect what Ronald Black calls the &quot;familiar Scottish experience of being thrashed for speaking [their] native language.&quot;

In response, An Comunn Gàidhealach was founded at Oban in 1891 to help preserve the Scottish Gaelic language and its literature and to establish the Royal National Mòd (), as a festival of Gaelic music, literature, arts, and culture deliberately modelled upon the National Eisteddfod of Wales. The poet, traditional singer, and Highland Land League activist Màiri Mhòr nan Òran (1821–1898), performed in the first Mòd&#x27;s Gaelic song competition, but she was not awarded a medal.

A largely takes the form of formal competitions. Choral events in Gaelic (both solo and by choirs), and Scottish traditional music including fiddling, bagpipe and folk groups dominate. Spoken word events include children&#x27;s and adults&#x27; poetry reading, storytelling and Bible reading, and categories such as ancient folk tale or humorous monologue. Children can also present an original drama, and there are competitions in written literature.

Unlike the national , local &quot;s&quot; usually only last a day or two. They attract a much smaller crowd and the only notable social event is the winners&#x27; ceilidh. As there are fewer competitions than in the national , this ceilidh is often more like a traditional ceilidh with dancing and guest singers between the winners&#x27; performances.

According to Ronald Black, &quot;In 1923, following the example of the Welsh Eisteddfod, &quot;An Commun Gàidhealach&quot; simplified the structure of its annual poetry competitions into a single contest for a Bardic Crown (), the winner to be acknowledged as Bard of An Commun () for the coming year. The man behind the move, not surprisingly, was Angus Robertson, then President of An Comunn. Offering a distinctive middle path between traditional and modern verse, the competition produced much work of note which deserves to be put into perspective... (Many subsidiary prizes remained; Sorley Maclean won a junior one in 1928, while in 1946 Derick Thomson won a gold medal as the most distinguished entrant in the literary competitions generally). The Bard was crowned each year at the closing concert of the Mòd. Astonishingly, unlike in Wales, the winning poem itself formed no part of the proceedings... In 1978 no award was made because not entry was of adequate quality. It was the second time in five years that this had happened, and in March 1979 An Comunn announced that the Bardic Crown would no longer be awarded.&quot;

There has been some recent criticism of the &quot;Gold Medal&quot; event, which favors the operatic-style Gaelic singing popularized in the early 20th century by Marjory Kennedy-Fraser. Some 21st century Scottish traditional musicians allege that the contest has long marginalised more traditional singers like the late Flora MacNeil and their styles. This is not a new criticism, however, and the poet Allan MacDonald (1859–1905), an iconic figure in Scottish Gaelic literature, once said that the Gaelic songs performed at the Mòd during its inception were, &quot;As though you were to fit a statue into a box by taking off the nose and ears.&quot;

More recently, Scottish traditional musician Fergus Munro has also gone on the record, as Scotland has grown increasingly secularised, as a critic of what he alleges is a growing tendency to exclude both Christian poetry and Gaelic psalm- and hymn-singing from the Mòd.

Furthermore, the Mòd is popularly known as the &quot;Whisky Olympics&quot;, which is considered, &quot;either a vicious slur or fair comment&quot;.

Similarly to the Eisteddfod, since its more recent creation, the Mòd tradition has been introduced to the Scottish diaspora.

In Nova Scotia, where a distinctive form of Gaelic brought by the early Highland settlers preserves the otherwise extinct Lochaber dialect, the Nova Scotia Gaelic Mod attracts visitors from both sides of the Canada–United States border.

In British Columbia, the Gaelic Society of Vancouver held a local biannually from 1990 to 2007.

First held at Alexandria, Virginia in 1988, the U.S. National Mòd is now held annually as part of the Highland games at Ligonier, Pennsylvania and sponsored by (&#x27;The American Scottish Gaelic Society&#x27;).

The 2011 Royal National Mòd, held at Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, crowned Lewis MacKinnon (&quot;Lodaidh MacFhionghain&quot;), a poet in the Canadian Gaelic dialect spoken in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, as the winning bard. It was the first time in the 120-year history of the that a writer of Gaelic poetry from the Scottish diaspora had won the Bardic Crown.

==In popular culture==
* The 1992 Welsh-language biographical film &quot;Hedd Wyn&quot; focuses on war poet Ellis Humphrey Evans&#x27; (Huw Garmon) pursuit of his lifelong dream of winning the bardic chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales and on his three-year-long battle against overwhelming pressure to enlist in the British Army during World War I. The bard is depicted as a tragic hero, with a visible disgust for the jingoism, ultranationalism, and Germanophobia that surrounds him. The film&#x27;s emotional impact is increased when the real Hedd Wyn&#x27;s love poetry and war poetry are read in voiceover at key moments of the film. The film was directed by Paul Turner and based on a screenplay by chaired and crowned bard Alan Llwyd. It also starred television actor Huw Garmon, who learned the dialect of Welsh spoken in Trawsfynydd during World War I by listening to the oral history tapes at St Fagans National History Museum, in the title role. The film was shot on location in Gwynedd and on a reconstruction of the battlefield at Passchendaele, but also on a shoestring budget of £400,000. However, &quot;Hedd Wyn&quot; went on to win the Royal Television Society&#x27;s Television Award for Best Single Drama. It was also the first British motion picture to be nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. In 1994, at the newly inaugurated BAFTA Cymru Awards, it won in six categories: Best Director (Paul Turner), Best Design (by Jane Roberts and Martin Morley), Best Drama – Welsh (Shan Davies and Paul Turner), Best Editor (Chris Lawrence), Best Original Music (John E.R. Hardy) and Best Screenwriter – Welsh (Alan Llwyd).
*An early flashback during the 1996 biographical film &quot;Shine&quot; shows Australian concert pianist David Helfgott (played by Alex Rafalowicz) as a child competing in an eisteddfod held in Adelaide, South Australia during the 1950s.

<doc id="297477" wikidata="Q2933988" url="?curid=297477" title="California Jam">
<text>California Jam (also known as Cal Jam) was a rock music festival co-headlined by Deep Purple and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, held at the Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California, on April 6, 1974. It was produced by ABC Entertainment, Sandy Feldman and Leonard Stogel. Pacific Presentations, a Los Angeles–based concert company headed by Sepp Donahower and Gary Perkins, coordinated the event, booked all the musical talent and ran the advertising campaign. Don Branker worked for Leonard Stogel and was responsible for concert site facilitation, toilets, fencing and medical. The California Jam attracted 250,000 paying music fans. The festival set what were then records for the loudest amplification system ever installed, the highest paid attendance, and highest gross in history. It was one of the last of the original wave of rock festivals, as well as one of the most well-executed and financially successful, and presaged the era of media consolidation and the corporatization of the rock music industry.

== Performers ==
In order of appearance
*Rare Earth
*Earth, Wind &amp; Fire
*Eagles, joined by Jackson Browne
*Seals and Crofts
*Black Oak Arkansas
*Black Sabbath
*Deep Purple
*Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer

The event was MC&#x27;d by New York DJ Don Imus.

Deep Purple&#x27;s performance was one of the first with their third line-up, which included vocalist David Coverdale and vocalist/bassist Glenn Hughes. Deep Purple was given the choice of when to go on stage, and chose sunset, thus pushing Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer to the last performance. Having assumed that, as with all festivals, the show would run late, they nonetheless delayed their appearance even when the festival ran ahead of schedule. Angry organizers tried to force Purple onstage, and threatened to cancel their performance. A quick thinking announcer told the crowds that Deep Purple would be on &quot;soon&quot;. The band made concertgoers wait nearly an hour until near dusk. Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore said the agreement was always for Purple to go on stage at dusk, and that the promoters were violating that signed agreement. In spite of this delay, the show did not end up running late. At the end of Purple&#x27;s set, Blackmore threw a guitar and a small speaker monitor into the audience, and suddenly attacked one of the network&#x27;s video cameras (the camera had been getting between the guitarist and the audience) with a guitar. Later on, a mishap with a pyrotechnic effect caused one of Blackmore&#x27;s amplifiers to explode, which briefly set the stage on fire. Purple left the concert area by helicopter to avoid a possible confrontation with Ontario fire marshals and ABC-TV executives. The damage to the ABC video camera, estimated to be $10,000, was settled by the band&#x27;s managers.

The weather on the day of the Cal Jam concert was unusually warm for April. At one point in the late afternoon, thousands of plastic gallon jugs were handed out to the audience, who were able to fill the jugs up at the many drinking fountains set up on the grounds. During the prolonged delay waiting for Deep Purple to hit the stage, restless concert goers began tossing their water jugs in the air. More and more of the audience joined in, until the air above the crowd was filled with hundreds of water jugs flying around, spraying water over the audience.

Deep Purple&#x27;s performance, along with some of the performances by other bands, was broadcast on TV and radio nationwide in the US. It was at this festival that the footage of Keith Emerson playing a grand piano spinning end-over-end 50 feet above the ground was taken.

For the Eagles&#x27; set, Jackson Browne was deputized for absent guitarist Don Felder, whose wife was giving birth to their first child.

&quot;Circus&quot; reported that Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer were &quot;angry with the Deep Purple boys, who refused to come onstage until darkness fell. ELP subsequently couldn&#x27;t begin their set until after one a.m.&quot;

== Attendance and technology ==


The concert set a record for the largest paid attendance at such an event. (Although more people attended the festival at Woodstock in New York, only a few thousand had purchased tickets.) &quot;Circus&quot; reported that there were &quot;more than 175,000 paid admissions&quot; and that &quot;the price was $10 in advance or $15 at the gate&quot;.

Another record established at California Jam was for the largest (most powerful) concert sound system ever assembled. This arose from the demands of Deep Purple, who were identified as the &quot;loudest band in the world&quot; by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. Tycobrahe Sound Company combined the touring systems of Purple, Black Oak Arkansas, Black Sabbath, Earth Wind and Fire, and Rare Earth (each manufactured by Tycobrahe), plus bass horns from Phoenix Sound and a complete array of folded bass horns from Flag Systems. Total power was 54,000 watts RMS, provided by a number of BFA-2000 amplifiers, manufactured by Tycobrahe. &quot;Circus&quot; commented on &quot;two 50 feet high speaker towers&quot; that transmitted Black Oak Arkansas singer Jim Dandy&#x27;s &quot;hot and nasty growl to swarms of people spread clear across the speedway&quot;.

The Goodyear blimp hovering overhead was a first for a music festival. Deep Purple arrived in their own chartered jet, the &quot;Starship&quot;, with the band&#x27;s name painted on the sides. This was the first time a major band arrived specifically for a music festival in their own aircraft.

Another first was the setting of the stage sets for each band on rails, allowing rapid changeover to the next band, thus eliminating delays and allowing the rock festival to run on time; in fact, ahead of time.

Emerson, Lake and Palmer&#x27;s touring sound system was set up about half a mile from the stage and timed with a tape delay to coincide with the sound from the stage.

== Broadcast, telecast and record releases ==

Unlike other rock festivals such as Woodstock, the concert was not planned for release as a film or sound recording. However, the ABC television network (which was also a sponsor of the concert) broadcast several portions of the show as part of its &quot;In Concert&quot; series several months later. The audio portion of the show was also broadcast in stereo on FM radio stations, an early example of simulcasting. KLOS FM (then owned and operated by ABC) promoted and broadcast the concert around Los Angeles.

Deep Purple&#x27;s California Jam performance was the first full-length music concert recording to be released and sold on video tape in the early 1980s.

Several performances from the show were eventually released on CD and video, both in bootleg and authorized form. One of the more notable bootleg recordings was from a fan who tried to pass off his recordings of a recording from the radio broadcast as something he created. His web site was shut down after he tried selling his unauthorized products without creative approval from the artists involved and the producers of the festival.

Authorized releases include:
* &quot;California Jamming&quot;, CD of Deep Purple&#x27;s performance (also released under different titles)
* &quot;Live in California 74&quot;, DVD of Deep Purple&#x27;s performance
* &quot;Beyond the Beginning&quot;, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer DVD including 44 minutes of their California Jam performance

== Cultural impact ==
A sequel concert, California Jam II, was held March 18, 1978.

== Book ==
A special limited edition photo book of 1,000 copies (some with band autographs and purple vinyl) was compiled by Simon Robinson and released as &quot;Deep Purple at The California Jam&quot; and published by Rufus Stone Limited Editions in 2013.

<text>Plunging fire is a form of indirect fire, where gunfire is fired at a trajectory to make it fall on its target from above. It is normal at the high trajectories used to attain long range, and can be used deliberately to attack a target not susceptible to direct or grazing fire due to not being in direct line of sight.

In naval warfare, plunging shellfire was theoretically capable of penetrating an enemy ship&#x27;s thinner deck armor rather than firing directly at a warship&#x27;s heavily armored side.

Plunging fire in terrestrial warfare allows attacking a target not in direct line of sight, for example over the brow of a hill engaging in a reverse slope defence. Artillery weapons such as howitzers and mortars are designed for this purpose. Machine guns and belt-fed grenade launchers may also use plunging fire.

The Vickers machine gun was used for indirect fire against enemy positions at ranges up to with Mark VIIIz ammunition. This plunging fire was used to great effect against specific features or points of interest that might be observed by a forward observer, or zeroed in at one time for future attacks, much to the surprise and confusion of the enemy.

The Australian Army still trains specialist infantry units, called Direct Fires Support Weapons DFSW teams, to perform an indirect sustained fire role with the MAG 58 GPMG, fitted with a C2A2 Support Weapons Sight - similar to a mortar sight. In this role the MAG 58 can fire a beaten zone up to a range .

<doc id="297479" wikidata="Q177348" url="?curid=297479" title="As the crow flies">
<text>The expression as the crow flies is an idiom for the most direct path between two points.

==Etymology==
The meaning of the expression is attested from the early 19th century, and appeared in the Charles Dickens novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838):

While crows do conspicuously fly alone across open country, they do not fly in especially straight lines. While crows do not swoop in the air like swallows or starlings, they often circle above their nests.

One suggested origin of the term is that before modern navigational methods were introduced, cages of crows were kept upon ships and a bird would be released from the crow&#x27;s nest when required to assist navigation, in the hope that it would fly directly towards land. However, the earliest recorded uses of the term are not nautical in nature, and the crow&#x27;s nest of a ship is thought to derive from its shape and position rather than its use as a platform for releasing crows. It has also been suggested that crows would not travel well in cages, as they fight if confined.

<doc id="297482" wikidata="Q1874622" url="?curid=297482" title="James E. Reilly">
<text>James E. Reilly (July 15, 1948 – October 12, 2008) was an American soap opera writer. He was the head writer of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and creator/head writer of &quot;Passions&quot;. Reilly won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series Writing as co-head writer for &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in 1993.

Reilly died in October 2008 while recovering from cardiac surgery.

==Career==
Reilly created the NBC Daytime soap opera &quot;Passions&quot; in 1999, and served as the series&#x27; head writer until its cancellation in 2008. He was previously the co-head writer of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 1990 to 1992 and &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; from 1992 to 1997. Reilly also worked as a staff writer for other daytime dramas prior to that, including &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

Though &quot;Passions&quot; was historically top-rated in key demographics, the series was plagued since its inception by low overall Nielsen ratings and the final episode aired on August 7, 2008.

During his run on &quot;Passions&quot;, Reilly returned to &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; as head writer from August 18, 2003 until August 9, 2006, and was succeeded by former &quot;As the World Turns&quot; head writer Hogan Sheffer.

Reilly was one of 20 writers who chose financial core status with the Writers Guild of America during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike; after the strike, the WGA wrote a letter releasing the names of these individuals, inviting accusations of blacklisting.

James E. Reilly had a triple major in psychology, social anthropology and biology.

===Departure from traditional stories===
In 1993, Reilly gained attention immediately after taking over as head writer on &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; for a storyline in which heroine Carly Manning (Crystal Chappell) is buried alive by villainess Vivian Alamain (Louise Sorel) for weeks, and taunted through speakers. Reilly began what is arguably his most infamous storyline in 1995 when the show&#x27;s central heroine, Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall), becomes possessed by Satan. The storyline played out for a year, with Marlena&#x27;s lover finally exorcising the demon, but not before garnering the show increased ratings — despite frequent interruptions by the O.J. Simpson murder trial going on at the time, and the criticism of longtime fans upset by &quot;liberties&quot; Reilly took with the characters and continuity. Finally, in 1996 Reilly gave Eileen Davidson, who had played Kristen Blake since 1993, a second role as Kristen&#x27;s lookalike Susan Banks, and between 1997 and 1998 added three more — including a man — with Davidson ultimately receiving a Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in 1998.

Reilly left &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; in 1997 and created &quot;Passions&quot; in 1999, freed of a pre-existing fan base to please. The series featured veteran actress Juliet Mills as Tabitha Lenox, a 300-year-old witch (with a doll-come-to-life sidekick) using magic and manipulation to wreak havoc on the citizens of a New England town. Standard soap opera melodrama was juxtaposed with sorcery, supernatural creatures and closet doors leading to Hell.

In an attempt to boost ratings, Reilly was asked to return to &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; as head writer in the summer of 2003. Days executive producers gave Reilly &quot;carte blanche&quot; to &quot;fix&quot; the show (while simultaneously remaining as head writer for &quot;Passions&quot;). What followed was a controversial and attention-getting storyline in which multiple long-running characters on the series are brutally murdered by a serial killer dubbed the Salem Stalker. The story grew increasingly graphic (and ironic) as recovering alcoholic Maggie Horton is bludgeoned by a liquor bottle and original cast member and town matriarch Alice Horton chokes to death on a donut, her culinary specialty, forced down her throat. The reveal that heroine Marlena Evans was somehow the killer made the February 3, 2004 cover of &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;. This was not all; shortly after Marlena died after being exposed as the killer, all the victims were discovered alive on the island of Melaswen (New Salem backwards), which revealed that Marlena had in fact been mind controlled to believe she was the killer. 
Reilly left the series again in 2006.

==Death==
After Reilly&#x27;s October 2008 death, Executive Producer Ken Corday of &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; said of him, &quot;The DAYS OF OUR LIVES family is deeply saddened by the recent passing of James E. Reilly. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family. Jim was not only an ingenious storyteller who changed the landscape of daytime drama, but he celebrated life with passion, humor, and an appreciation for the best it has to offer. He was an inspiration for us all...and will be greatly missed.&quot; &quot;Passions&quot; Executive Producer Lisa de Cazotte said, &quot;Jim Reilly was not only a legend in our industry, but he was a great friend and mentor. His creativity, sense of humor and genius will be sorely missed. There will never be another like him and I am deeply grateful for the years we spent working together on PASSIONS and for the joy he brought to my life.&quot;

<text>John Anthony Aniston (born Yannis Anastassakis, , July 24, 1933 – November 11, 2022) was an American actor who played Victor Kiriakis on the NBC daytime drama series &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, which he originated in July 1985 and played on and off for 37 years, until his death in 2022. His portrayal earned him a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2017 and he received a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2022. He was the father of actress Jennifer Aniston.

==Early life==
Aniston was born in Pervolakia, Chania on the island of Crete, Greece, on July 24, 1933, to Stella Joanne (née Koume; 1899–1991) and Antonios Anastassakis (1891–1966). The family left Crete for the United States when Aniston was two years old; his father anglicized the family&#x27;s names on arriving in the US. The family settled in Chester, Pennsylvania, where they operated a restaurant.

Aniston attended Eddystone High School and later graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theater arts. While at Penn State, he became a member of Alpha Chi Rho fraternity. After college, he served in the United States Navy as an intelligence officer on active duty in Panama and later in the Reserve, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander.

==Career==
Aniston began his acting career in 1962 in &quot;87th Precinct&quot; as &quot;Officer #1&quot; in the episode &quot;New Man in the Precinct&quot;. He appeared in soap operas regularly starting in 1970, when he first joined &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as a character named Dr. Eric Richards. In 1975, he joined the cast of &quot;Love of Life&quot; as Eddie Aleata, appearing through 1978. He played Mary Stuart&#x27;s new love interest, Martin Tourneur, on &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; from 1980 until April 1984. He returned to the cast of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; a second time, this time as Victor Kiriakis, in July 1985, and continued to play the role until his death. He was nominated for the 2017 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his performance.

In April 2022, it was announced that Aniston would receive a Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award at the 49th Annual Daytime Creative Arts &amp; Lifestyle Emmy Awards on June 18.

Aniston also played small roles on the television series &quot;Airwolf&quot; in the season two episode &quot;Short Walk to Freedom&quot;, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; as Douglas Swope in the 2002 episode &quot;A Deep Fried Korean Thanksgiving&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot; as Alexander Thompson in the episodes &quot;Game On&quot; and &quot;Debate Camp&quot; (both in 2002), as the First IMF Captain in the 1969 &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; episode &quot;Time Bomb&quot;. Aniston has also made guest appearances on &quot;Combat!&quot; (1964), &quot;My Big Fat Greek Life&quot; (2002), &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (2001), &quot;American Dreams&quot; (with &quot;Days&quot; co-star Frances Reid), &quot;Journeyman&quot;, and &quot;Mad Men&quot;.

==Personal life==
Aniston had a daughter, Jennifer Aniston (b. 1969), with his first wife, Nancy Dow, and a son, Alexander (b. 1989), with his second wife, Sherry Rooney (whom he met while co-starring on &quot;Love of Life&quot;). His daughter Jennifer&#x27;s godfather was Telly Savalas, one of his best friends.
Aniston died on November 11, 2022, at the age of 89.

<text>A notary is a person authorised to perform acts in legal affairs, in particular witnessing signatures on documents. The form that the notarial profession takes varies with local legal systems.

A notary, while a legal professional, is distinct from an advocate in that they do not represent the person who engages their services, or act in contentious matters. 

The Worshipful Company of Scriveners use an old English term for a notary, and are an association of notaries practising in central London since 1372.

==Overview==
Documents are notarized to deter fraud and to ensure they are properly executed. An impartial witness (the notary) identifies signers to screen out impostors and to make sure they have entered into agreements knowingly and willingly. Loan documents including deeds, affidavits, contracts, and powers of attorney are very common documents needing notarization. 

Code of Hammurabi Law 122 (c. 1755–1750 BCE) stipulated that a depositor of gold, silver, or other chattel/movable property for safekeeping must present all articles and a signed contract of bailment to a notary before depositing the articles with a banker, and Law 123 stipulated that a banker was discharged of any liability from a contract of bailment if the notary denied the existence of the contract. Law 124 stipulated that a depositor with a notarized contract of bailment was entitled to redeem the entire value of their deposit.

To &quot;notarize&quot; a document or event is not a term of art, and its definition varies from place to place; but it generally means the performance by a notary of a series of possible steps, which may include the following (not an exhaustive list):

# Identifying the person appearing before the notary through personal acquaintance or by reference to significant proofs of identity including passport, driving license, etc.
# Where land titles are involved or significant rights may accrue by reference to the identity, signatures may also be verified, recorded and compared.
# Recording the proof of identity in the notarial register or protocol.
# Satisfying the notary that the person appearing is of full age and capacity to do whatever is intended.
# Taking an affidavit or declaration and recording that fact.
# Taking detailed instructions for a protest of a bill of exchange or a ship&#x27;s protest and preparing it.
# Recording the signature of the person in the register or protocol.
# Taking an acknowledgment (in the United States) of execution of a document and preparing a certificate of acknowledgement.
# Preparing a notarial certificate (in most other jurisdictions) as to the execution or other step.
# Sealing or stamping and signing the document.
# Recording all steps in the register or protocol.
# Delivering the completed original to the person appearing.
# In some cases, retaining a copy of the document in the register or protocol.
# Charging the person appearing a fee for the service.
===Common law vs. civil law notaries===

Most common law systems have what is called in the United States a notary public, a public official who notarizes legal documents and who can also administer and take oaths and affirmations, among other tasks. Although notaries public are public officials, they are not paid by the government; they may obtain income by charging fees, provide free services in connection with other employment (for example, bank employees), or provide free services for the public good. In the United States (except Puerto Rico), any person – lawyer or otherwise – may be commissioned as a notary.

Most civil law-based systems (including Puerto Rico and Quebec) have the civil law notary, a legal professional performing many more functions than a common-law notary public. They are qualified lawyers who provide many of the same services as common-law attorneys/solicitors (negotiation and drafting of contracts, legal advice, settlement of estates, creation of a company and its status, writing of wills and power of attorney, interpretation of the law, mediation, etc.) except any involvement in disputes to be presented before a court.

In the United States, a signing agent, also known as a loan signing agent, is a notary public who specializes in notarizing mortgage and real estate documents. 

Notaries in civil law jurisdictions are specialized in all matters relating to real estate, completing title exams in order to confirm the ownership of the property, the existence of any encumbrances such as easements or mortgages and hypothecs.

Often, in the case of lawyer notaries, the certificate to be provided will not require the person appearing to sign. Examples are certificates authenticating copies and certificates as to law, such as certificates as to the capacity of a company to perform certain acts, or explaining probate law in the place.

== Online systems ==
In the United States, many states including Virginia, Texas, Ohio, and Nevada have passed laws allowing for online witness by notaries, using screen sharing or webcams as well as identity verification processes. To comply with state law, notaries must be located in any of the states that have authorized remote notarization services. Virginia was the first state to pass legislation allowing online notarization in 2012. Texas and Nevada passed similar laws in 2017 that went into effect in July 2018. As of December 19, 2023 there were 47 states and the District of Columbia have laws that allow remote e-notarization, although not all have finished implementing necessary rules.

<doc id="297485" wikidata="Q1031944" url="?curid=297485" title="Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent">
<text>Thomas Holland, 2nd Baron Holand, and &quot;jure uxoris&quot; 1st Earl of Kent, KG (26 December 1360) was an English nobleman and military commander during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. By the time of the Crécy campaign, he had apparently lost one of his eyes.

==Early life==

He was from a gentry family in Upholland, Lancashire. He was a son of Robert de Holland, 1st Baron Holand and Maud la Zouche. One of his brothers was Otho Holand, who was also made a Knight of the Garter.

==Military career==

In his early military career, he fought in Flanders. He was engaged, in 1340, in the English expedition into Flanders and sent, two years later, with Sir John D&#x27;Artevelle to Bayonne, to defend the Gascon frontier against the French. In 1343, he was again on service in France. 

In 1346, he attended King Edward III into Normandy in the immediate retinue of the Earl of Warwick; and, at the taking of Caen, the Count of Eu and Guînes, Constable of France, and the Count De Tancarville surrendered themselves to him as prisoners.

According to chronicler Jean le Bel, they recognized Sir Thomas and his knights from earlier military campaigns on the continent during which they had traveled and fought side by side. Allegedly they shouted to him and his companions from the gatehouse window:
&quot;Ah! In God&#x27;s name, sir knights, come up here and save us from those pitiless men who&#x27;ll kill us like all the others if they catch us!&quot;

After securing the prisoners, Sir Thomas and the remainder of his retinue then allegedly returned to the fray, attempting to prevent further violence and protect the women and girls of the captured town. 

This latter incident is remarkable, being one of the very few recorded instances of true mercy (as opposed to the ransom-motivated sparing of prisoners) shown to any of the inhabitants during the otherwise luridly barbaric sacking of Caen, during which many women and girls were raped and an estimated 5,000 French were killed, the vast majority civilians. It is unrecorded, however, to what extent Sir Thomas and his men were successful.

During the long journey of the English forces through the French countryside in the summer of 1346, Sir Thomas is recorded as having at one point ridden up to a bridge the French had broken at Elbeuf, killing two enemy soldiers and crying:
&quot;St. George for Edward!&quot;

At the Battle of Crécy, Sir Thomas was one of the principal commanders in the vanguard under the Prince of Wales and he, afterwards, served at the Siege of Calais in 1346–47. In 1348, he was invested as one of the founders and 13th Knight of the new Order of the Garter.

Around the same time as, or before, his first expedition, he secretly married the 12-year-old Joan of Kent, daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent (son of Edward I and Margaret of France) and Margaret Wake. However, during his absence on foreign service, Joan, under pressure from her family, contracted another marriage with William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury (of whose household Holland had been seneschal). This second marriage was annulled in 1349, when Joan&#x27;s previous marriage with Holland was proved to the satisfaction of the papal commissioners. Joan was ordered by the Pope to return to her husband and live with him as his lawful wife, which she did, and had 4 children by him.

Between 1353 and 1356, he was summoned to Parliament as Baron de Holland. His brother-in-law, John, Earl of Kent, died in 1352, and Holland became Earl of Kent in right of his wife, although it was in 1360 that he was summoned to Parliament with that title.

In 1354, Holland was the king&#x27;s lieutenant in Brittany during the minority of the Duke of Brittany, and in 1359 co-captain-general for all the English continental possessions.

Holland died of illness in Normandy on 28 December 1360. He was succeeded as baron by his son Thomas, the earldom still being held by his wife (though the son later became Earl in his own right). Another son, John, became Earl of Huntingdon and Duke of Exeter.

==Children==
Thomas and Joan of Kent had five children:

* Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent
* John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter
* Joan Holland, who married John IV, Duke of Brittany
* Maud Holland, married firstly Hugh Courtenay grandson of Hugh de Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon and secondly, Waleran III of Luxembourg, Count of Ligny
* Edmund Holland (c. 1354), who died young

<text>Appalachian State University (), or App State, is a public university in Boone, North Carolina, United States. It was founded as a teachers&#x27; college in 1899 by brothers B. B. and D. D. Dougherty and the latter&#x27;s wife, Lillie Shull Dougherty. The university expanded to include other programs in 1967 and joined the University of North Carolina System in 1971.

The university enrolls more than 21,500 students. It offers more than 150 bachelor&#x27;s degrees and 70 graduate degree programs, including two doctoral programs. The university has eight colleges: the College of Arts and Sciences, the Walker College of Business, the Reich College of Education, the College of Fine and Applied Arts, the Beaver College of Health Sciences, the Honors College, the Hayes School of Music, and University College. It opened an additional campus in Hickory in 2023.

The Athletic Teams compete in the Sun Belt Conference, except for a few sports that compete in the Southern Conference, such as wrestling. The teams are known as the Mountaineers.

==History==
Appalachian State University began in 1899 when a group of residents in Watauga County, under the leadership of Blanford B. Dougherty and his brother Dauphin D. Dougherty, began a movement to educate teachers in northwestern North Carolina. Land was donated by Daniel B. Dougherty, father of the leaders in the enterprise, and J. F. Hardin. On this site a wood-frame building, costing $1,000, was erected by contributions from citizens of the town and county. In the fall of 1899, the Dougherty brothers, acting as co-principals, began the school, which was then called Watauga Academy. The first year saw 53 students enrolled in three grades. D. D. Dougherty&#x27;s wife, Lillie Shull Dougherty, taught classes and contributed to administrative decisions.

In 1903, after interest in the school had spread to adjoining counties, D. D. Dougherty was convinced the state would fund institutions established to train teachers. He traveled to Raleigh after drafting a bill. W. C. Newland of Caldwell County introduced the bill in the North Carolina Legislature to make this a state school, with an appropriation for maintenance and for building. E. F. Lovill of Watauga County, R. B. White of Franklin County, Clyde Hoey of Cleveland County, and E. J. Justice of McDowell County spoke in favor of the measure. On March 9, 1903, the bill became law, and the Appalachian Training School for Teachers was established. The school opened on October 5, 1903, with $2,000 from the state and 325 students.

For 22 years, there was a period of steady growth, academic development, and service to the state. In 1925, the legislature changed the name to the Appalachian State Normal School and appropriated additional funding for maintenance and permanent improvement. In 1929, the school became a four-year degree granting institution and was renamed Appalachian State Teachers College. Over 1,300 students were enrolled in degree programs offered for primary grades education, physical education, math, English, science, and history.

Appalachian attained national standards by becoming accredited by the American Association for Teacher Education in 1939, and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1942. In 1948 a graduate school was formed. Dr. Dougherty retired in 1955 after 56 years of serving the school. J. D. Rankin became interim president until William H. Plemmons was installed. Plemmons led from 1955 to 1969, and his administration oversaw the addition of new buildings as the campus expanded and enrollment grew to nearly 5,000 students.

Appalachian was transformed from a single-purpose teachers&#x27; college into a multipurpose regional university and Appalachian State Teacher&#x27;s College became Appalachian State University in 1967. Growth continued in the 1970s to around 9,500 students and 550 faculty. Afterward, four degree-granting undergraduate colleges were created: Arts and Sciences, Business, Fine and Applied Arts, and Education. Herbert Wey succeeded Plemmons as president in 1969 and was named chancellor in 1971. In 1972, Appalachian State became part of the University of North Carolina system.

==Campus==
Located in the Blue Ridge Mountains of northwestern North Carolina, Appalachian State University has one of the highest elevations of any U.S. university east of the Mississippi River, at . Its main campus is in downtown Boone, a town of 19,092 compared to an ASU enrollment of 21,253 students. The campus encompasses , including a main campus of with 20 residence halls, 3 main dining facilities, 30 academic buildings, and 11 recreation/athletic facilities.

The center of campus is nicknamed Sanford Mall, an open grassy quad between the student union, dining halls, and library. Sanford Hall, on the mall&#x27;s edge, is named for Terry Sanford, a former governor of the state. Rivers Street, a thoroughfare for town and university traffic, essentially divides the campus into east and west sections with tunnels and a pedestrian bridge connecting the two halves. The eastern half includes Sanford Mall, Plemmons Student Union, Roess Dining Hall (formerly Central Dining Hall), and Carol Grotnes Belk Library and Information Commons, along with two communities of residence halls. The west side has Trivette Dining Hall, the Student Recreation Center (or SRC), the Quinn Recreation Center, Kidd Brewer Stadium, and Stadium Heights and Yosef Hollow, the two remaining residence hall communities. At the north end, Bodenheimer Drive crosses over Rivers Street and leads to Appalachian Heights (an apartment-style residence hall), Mountaineer Hall, the Chancellor&#x27;s House, the Living Learning Center, and Jim and Bettie Smith Stadium. The George M. Holmes Convocation Center at Rivers Street&#x27;s south end is the gateway and entrance to campus.

===Turchin Center for the Visual Arts===
The Turchin Center for the Visual Arts on the edge of main campus is the university&#x27;s visual art center. It is the largest visual arts center in northwestern North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and southwestern Virginia. It displays rotating exhibits indoors and outdoors, some culturally specific to the Appalachians, and offers community outreach programs through art courses. It opened in 2003. The newly renovated Schaefer Center for the Performing Arts, a 1,635-seat performance venue, hosts artists from around the world.

===Appalachian State University Preserve===
The Appalachian State University Nature Preserve consists of 67 acres of protected woodlands near the heart of campus. The land was dedicated as a State Natural Area in 1999 through the North Carolina Nature Preserves Act, and serves as an outdoor classroom for students and faculty. The preserve&#x27;s primary purpose is to enable conservation, education, and recreation for students, staff, and faculty.

==Administration==
The University of North Carolina&#x27;s Board of Governors plans and develops the coordinated system of higher education in the state. It sets university policy but delegate Appalachian State&#x27;s daily operations to a chancellor. The chancellor likewise delegates some duties to the provost, several vice-chancellors, and other administrative offices. These administrative offices are advised by several university committees on the needs of campus constituents, as represented by a Faculty Senate, Staff Senate, Graduate Student Association Senate, and the Student Government Association.

====Watauga Residential College====

Watauga Residential College (formerly Watauga Global Community) is a residential college founded in 1972. Watauga College was founded to be an &quot;interdisciplinary, experimental, residential, coed alternative for social science and humanities general education requirements.&quot; Watauga Residential College was developed as &quot;response to rising criticism of American education during the sixties and to the artificial fragmentation of knowledge in the academy; it was seen as a return to the world, where problems and themes do not recognize disciplinary boundaries and education is reconnected with individual learners.&quot;

Although it has changed names over the years, Watauga College in 1972, Watauga Global Community in 2008, and Watauga Residential College in 2014, its mission has remained relatively the same. &quot;Watauga Residential College pursues its mission through a sequenced, interdisciplinary, experiential curriculum that requires students to integrate class content, community-based research, and multicultural immersion. This innovative curriculum, in conjunction with the academic and residential community, creates an atmosphere for the emergence of dynamic learning experiences through unique interactions among students and faculty.&quot; A key focus of Watauga is on the residential community, so for the first year students are required to live in the living learning center.

Watauga College was first based in Watauga Hall, then for decades was based in East Hall, a large U-shaped dormitory on the east end of campus. The dorm was known campus-wide as having the largest rooms of any dorm on campus, yet it was one of the oldest dorms on campus. Upon the completion of the Living Learning Center in 2003, Watauga College relocated and East Hall will either be renovated or destroyed because of the high cost of renovating such an old building.

Students at ASU enjoy a variety of outdoor activities. The mountains offer snowboarding, skiing, tubing, rock climbing, hiking, rafting, camping, and fishing on and around the Blue Ridge Parkway. ASU also has over 400 clubs and organizations run by the McCaskey Center for Student Involvement and Leadership, such as Greek organizations, academic and diversity clubs, and sports clubs. Before the start of every semester, the university hosts a Club Expo featuring all the campus clubs and organizations. This event is for students to find an organization or club that suits them and get involved. The university also has volunteer centers, including the Multicultural Center, the LGBT Center, and the Women&#x27;s Center (the only completely volunteer-run Women&#x27;s Center in North Carolina). All three are under the supervision of the Multicultural Student Development Office. In 2016, ASU opened a fourth center in the student union; the Student Veterans Resource Center. The campus also has three indoor fitness facilities, an athletics field, and an outdoor recreation center.

The Appalachian Popular Programming Society (A.P.P.S.) is a university-funded organization that exists to plan and provide diverse educational, enriching, and entertaining events for ASU&#x27;s student body and community. Through its seven programming councils, A.P.P.S. members select, plan, promote, and present a diverse variety of popular entertainment programs and films that enhance ASU students&#x27; social and cultural life. A.P.P.S. was founded in 1985 to help with the student nightlife and to support retention. It plays a vital role in fostering and developing an inclusive ASU community. The seven councils of A.P.P.S. are Heritage, Club Shows, Main Stage, Representation and Intentional Student Engagement (RISE), Films, Special Events, and Spirit &amp; Traditions. Students can enjoy concerts and other miscellaneous events at Legends, an entertainment facility on campus. ASU also offers an in-house movie theater at Plemmons Student Union, Greenbriar Theater, where students can watch movies.

==Sustainability==

Appalachian has invested in several sustainability projects in recent years such as:

* A wind turbine was installed at the Broyhill Inn and Conference Center in 2008. The wind turbine has become the most visible symbol of Appalachian&#x27;s projects in renewable energy. Situated at the highest point on campus and standing more than tall, it was selected specifically to depict an industrial-scale wind turbine. , the turbine had produced over .
* Both Frank Residence Hall, renovated in 2009, and The Mountaineer Residence Hall erected in 2011 have LEED® Gold Certifications and received a total of 68 points based on energy saving and sustainability features (65 points are needed to receive gold certification). Mountaineer Residence Hall houses a 40-panel solar thermal system to provide hot water needs. Buildings on ASU&#x27;s campus that utilize solar energy include the Varsity Gym, Plemmons Student Union, Raley Hall, and Kerr Scott Hall. Kerr Scott Hall also has the first green roof on campus. The green roof works to conserve energy by providing shade and removing heat from the air through evapotranspiration. 
* Appalachian Food Services is working to reduce food waste on campus by sending pre- and post-consumer food waste to a composting facility whose compost is used by Appalachian&#x27;s Landscape Services as fertilizers.
* The AppalCART is a no-cost public transit service that services the campus and surrounding Boone community.
* Solar trash compactors were installed around Sanford mall in 2010. The trash compactors run 100% on solar power, and are completely self powered. 
* Outside of the Living Learning Center sits The Edible Schoolyard which is a community space where students, faculty, and staff can maintain a garden plot to learn gardening practices. At this garden space, small-scale farming and gardening principles are pursued in an effort to teach productive maintenance of agricultural ecosystems, self-sufficiency, and permaculture. 
* We Are Still In (2018) - Over 3,500 organizations, representative of the United States&#x27; economy and society, are showing the world that we stand by the Paris Climate Agreement and are committed to meeting its goals.
* Tree Campus USA certification - Appalachian State University has received Tree Campus USA certification from the Arbor Day Foundation. The certification process was a collaborative effort between the Department of Biology, Department of Geography and Planning, Physical Plant and New River Light and Power. &quot;This certification demonstrates Appalachian&#x27;s commitment to environmental aspects of sustainability.&quot;
* American Campuses Act on Climate Roundtable invited participant (2015) - Appalachian State University was one of 38 institutions of higher learning invited to participate in the American Campuses Act on Climate Roundtable Nov. 19 at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C. The event was hosted by the White House Council on Environmental Quality.
* Climate Leadership Award - In October 2015, the university was a recipient of Second Nature and the USGBC&#x27;s Climate Leadership Award, which recognized Appalachian&#x27;s commitment to climate action.

* Received Carolina Recycling Association award - Appalachian State University&#x27;s composting program has received the Outstanding Composting or Organics Program Award from the Carolina Recycling Association.

==Athletics==

Appalachian&#x27;s sports teams are nicknamed the Mountaineers. The Mountaineers compete in NCAA Division I and are members of the Sun Belt Conference. Appalachian fields varsity teams in 17 sports, 7 for men and 10 for women. The Mountaineer football team started competing in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) in the 2014–2015 academic year. 

Kidd Brewer Stadium is the 30,000-seat home of Appalachian football. Nicknamed &quot;The Rock&quot;, the stadium is located at an elevation of . In 2017, App State added a new video board, sound system and LED ribbon displays.

The George M. Holmes Convocation Center is the home court for Appalachian&#x27;s basketball teams. The arena, with seating for 8,325, is also the home for volleyball and indoor track and field. In 2017, a new Daktronics video board was installed. The board is made up of nine displays totaling a square footage of 1,200.

University Recreation (UREC) also offers 20 club sports that compete with other regional institutions on a non-varsity level: lacrosse (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), rugby (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), soccer (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), ultimate frisbee (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), volleyball (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), climbing, cycling, equestrian, fencing, ice hockey, skiing, racquetball, snowboarding, swimming, and triathlon.

The team competes in every discipline of bicycle racing that is acknowledged by National Collegiate Cycling Association within USA Cycling. This includes road bicycle racing, Mountain bike racing and Cyclocross. The team won the Division 2, as established by USA Cycling, collegiate team mountain bike national championships in 2008. They won the Division 2 collegiate team cyclocross national championships in 2008 and 2009. The team is now recognized as a Division 1 team.

On February 19, 2011, the Appalachian State Mountaineer women&#x27;s basketball team won the 2011 Southern Conference regular-season title. The last time they had won the title was 1996. This is a first for Head Coach Darcie Vincent. On May 18, 2012, the Appalachian State baseball team beat Western Carolina University, becoming Southern Conference baseball champions for the first time since 1985.

===Football===
Appalachian won three consecutive Division I FCS (I-AA) national championships in 2005, 2006, and 2007, over the University of Northern Iowa, the University of Massachusetts, and the University of Delaware, respectively. The Mountaineers are the first FCS football team to win three straight national championships since the playoffs began in 1978. They are also the first Division I program to win three consecutive national championships since Army accomplished the feat in 1944, 1945, and 1946.

In a milestone for ASU athletics, on September 1, 2007, the Appalachian State football team played their season opener at the fifth-ranked University of Michigan in front of the largest crowd to ever witness an ASU football game. Appalachian State beat Michigan in the game that would become known as the &quot;Alltime Upset&quot; by Sports Illustrated with a final score of 34–32 and became the first Division I FCS (I-AA) football team to defeat a Division I FBS (I-A) team ranked in the AP poll.

Appalachian State moved to the FBS subdivision in 2014, finishing its first season with a winning record but ineligible for a bowl bid per NCAA rules. Each season from 2015 to 2019, App State won both its conference championship and final bowl game. In 2020, although the Mountaineers did not win the Sun Belt Conference, they did win their sixth consecutive bowl game, defeating North Texas 56–28 in the inaugural Myrtle Beach Bowl.

===Athletic bands===

The Hayes School of Music provides support for the Mountaineers at all home football games with the Marching Mountaineers, and at all home basketball games with the Appalachian Pep Band. The Marching Mountaineers travel to a select few away games each football season. The director of the athletic bands is Dr. Jason P. Gardner.

==In media==
In 2004, a committee for the Appalachian Family Caravan tour created a promotional video titled &quot;Hot Hot Hot&quot;, shown throughout the area by Chancellor Kenneth E. Peacock. The video became an inadvertent internet phenomenon and was featured on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Web Junk 20&quot; program in early 2006. The video was never intended to promote Appalachian State to anyone but the Family Caravan, much less as a recruiting tool for prospective students. The video is no longer used by the university, due to student and alumni protests.

In 2002, MTV&#x27;s program &quot;Road Rules&quot; visited App State to produce an episode called &quot;Campus Crawl&quot;, aired on-campus during an annual, winter student swimming event called the &quot;Polar Plunge&quot;. The show&#x27;s participants also crossed a high-wire strung between Coltrane and Gardner Halls.

On March 16, 2012, Appalachian State placed a tenured sociology professor on administrative leave for a variety of charges, which included showing an anti-pornography documentary, &quot;The Price of Pleasure&quot;. This move gained national attention from the academic community.

<text>Paul William &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant (September 11, 1913 – January 26, 1983) was an American college football player and coach. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest college football coaches of all time, and best known as the head coach of the University of Alabama football team, the Alabama Crimson Tide, from 1958 to 1982. During his 25-year tenure as Alabama&#x27;s head coach, he amassed six national championships and 13 conference championships. Upon his retirement in 1982, he held the record for the most wins (323) as a head coach in collegiate football history. The Paul W. Bryant Museum, Paul W. Bryant Hall, Paul W. Bryant Drive, and Bryant–Denny Stadium are all named in his honor at the University of Alabama.

He was also known for his trademark black and white houndstooth hat (even though he normally wore a plaid one), deep voice, casually leaning up against the goal post during pre-game warmups, and holding his rolled-up game plan while on the sidelines. Before arriving at Alabama, Bryant was head football coach at the University of Maryland, the University of Kentucky, and Texas A&amp;M University.

==Early life==
Bryant was the 11th of 12 children who were born to Wilson Monroe Bryant and Ida Kilgore Bryant in Moro Bottom, Cleveland County, Arkansas. His nickname stemmed from his having agreed to wrestle a captive bear during a carnival promotion when he was 13 years old. His mother wanted him to be a minister, but Bryant told her &quot;Coaching is a lot like preaching.&quot; He attended Fordyce High School, where the tall Bryant, who as an adult would eventually stand , began playing on the school&#x27;s football team as an eighth grader. During his senior season, Bryant played offensive line and defensive end, and the team won the 1930 Arkansas state football championship.

==College playing career==
Bryant accepted a scholarship to play for the University of Alabama in 1931. Since he elected to leave high school before completing his diploma, Bryant had to enroll in a Tuscaloosa high school to finish his education during the fall semester while he practiced with the college team. Bryant played end for the Crimson Tide and was a participant on the school&#x27;s 1934 national championship team. Bryant was the self-described &quot;other end&quot; during his playing years with the team, playing opposite the big star, Don Hutson, who later became a star in the National Football League and a Pro Football Hall of Famer. Bryant himself was second team All-Southeastern Conference in 1934, and was third team all conference in both 1933 and 1935. Bryant played with a partially broken leg in a 1935 game against Tennessee. Bryant was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity, and as a senior, he married Mary Harmon, which he kept a secret since Alabama did not allow active players to be married.

Bryant was selected in the fourth round by the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1936 NFL draft, but he never played professional football.

==Coaching career==
===Assistant and North Carolina Pre-Flight===
After graduating from the University of Alabama in 1936, Bryant was hired as the line coach under head coach A. B. Hollingsworth at Union University in Jackson, Tennessee, but he left that position when offered an assistant coaching position under Frank Thomas at the University of Alabama. Over the next four years, the team compiled a 29–5–3 record. In 1937, he was offered a position as the line coach for VMI under Pooley Hubert, but Bryant ultimately declined the offered and signed a two-year contract to stay with Alabama. In 1940, he left Alabama to become the line coach at Vanderbilt University under first-year Red Sanders. During their 1940 season, Bryant served as head coach of the Commodores for their 7–7 tie against Kentucky as Sanders was recovering from an appendectomy. After the 1941 season, Bryant was offered the head coaching job at the University of Arkansas. However, Pearl Harbor was bombed soon thereafter, and Bryant declined the position to join the United States Navy. In 1942, he served as the ends coach for the Georgia Pre-Flight Skycrackers.

Bryant then served off North Africa, on the United States Army Transport &quot;SS Uruguay&quot;, seeing no combat action. On February 12, 1943, in the North Atlantic the oil tanker USS Salamonie suffered a steering fault and accidentally rammed the SS Uruguay amidships. The tanker&#x27;s bow made a 70-foot (21m) hole in Uruguay&#x27;s hull and penetrated her, killing 13 soldiers and injuring 50. The Uruguay&#x27;s crew contained the damage by building a temporary bulkhead and three days later she reached Bermuda. President Franklin D. Roosevelt decorated Uruguay&#x27;s Captain, Albert Spaulding, with the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal for saving many lives, his ship and her cargo.

Bryant was later granted an honorable discharge to train recruits and coach the North Carolina Navy Pre-Flight football team. One of the players he coached for the Navy was the future Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Otto Graham. While in the navy, Bryant attained the rank of lieutenant commander.

===Maryland===
In 1945, 32-year-old Bryant met Washington Redskins owner George Marshall at a cocktail party hosted by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and mentioned that he had turned down offers to be an assistant coach at Alabama and Georgia Tech because he was intent on becoming a head coach. Marshall put him in contact with Harry Clifton &quot;Curley&quot; Byrd, the president and former football coach of the University of Maryland.

After meeting with Byrd the next day, Bryant received the job as head coach of the Maryland Terrapins. In his only season at Maryland, Bryant led the team to a 6–2–1 record. However, Bryant and Byrd came into conflict. In the most prominent incident, while Bryant was on vacation, Byrd brought back a player that was suspended by Bryant for not following the team rules. After the 1945 season, Bryant left Maryland to take over as head coach at the University of Kentucky.

===Kentucky===
Bryant coached at Kentucky for eight seasons. Under Bryant, Kentucky made its first bowl appearance in 1947 and won its first Southeastern Conference title in 1950. The 1950 Kentucky Wildcats football team finished with a school best 11–1 record and concluded the season with a victory over Bud Wilkinson&#x27;s top-ranked Oklahoma Sooners in the Sugar Bowl. The final AP poll was released before bowl games in that era, so Kentucky ended the regular season ranked #7. But several other contemporaneous polls, as well as the Sagarin Ratings System applied retrospectively, declared Bryant&#x27;s 1950 Wildcats to be the national champions, but neither the NCAA nor College Football Data Warehouse recognizes this claim. Bryant also led Kentucky to appearances in the Great Lakes Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Cotton Bowl Classic. Kentucky&#x27;s final AP poll rankings under Bryant included #11 in 1949, #7 in 1950, #15 in 1951, #20 in 1952, and #16 in 1953. The 1950 season was Kentucky&#x27;s highest rank until it finished #6 in the final 1977 AP Poll.

Though he led Kentucky&#x27;s football program to its greatest achievement, Bryant resigned after the 1953 season because he felt that Adolph Rupp&#x27;s basketball team would always be the school&#x27;s primary sport. The point shaving scandal that rocked the basketball program had Kentucky focus their energy on basketball, keeping Rupp on even after it had broken in 1952, causing the Wildcats to be given the death penalty for the 1952–53 season. Bryant tried to resign that year for Arkansas but the school did not let him. Once it was confirmed that Rupp would not resign, Bryant was even more determined to leave. Years after leaving Lexington, when Bryant was Alabama&#x27;s athletic director in 1969, he called Rupp to ask if he had any recommendations for Alabama&#x27;s new basketball coach. Rupp recommended C. M. Newton, a former backup player at Kentucky in the late 1940s. Newton went on to lead the Crimson Tide to three straight SEC titles.

===Texas A&amp;M===
In 1954, Bryant accepted the head coaching job at Texas A&amp;M University. He also served as athletic director.

The Aggies suffered through a grueling 1–9 season in 1954, which began with the infamous training camp in Junction, Texas. The &quot;survivors&quot; were given the name &quot;Junction Boys&quot;. Two years later, Bryant led the 1956 Texas A&amp;M Aggies football team to the Southwest Conference championship with a 34–21 victory over the Texas Longhorns at Austin. The following year, Bryant&#x27;s star back John David Crow won the Heisman Trophy, and the 1957 Aggies were in title contention until they lost to the #20 Rice Owls in Houston, amid rumors that Alabama would be going after Bryant.

Again, as at Kentucky, Bryant attempted to integrate the Texas A&amp;M squad. &quot;We&#x27;ll be the last football team in the Southwest Conference to integrate&quot;, he was told by a Texas A&amp;M official. &quot;Well&quot;, Bryant replied, &quot;then that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re going to finish in football.&quot;

At the close of the 1957 season, having compiled an overall 25–14–2 record at Texas A&amp;M, Bryant returned to Tuscaloosa to take the head coaching position, succeeding Jennings B. Whitworth, as well as the athletic director job at Alabama.

===Alabama===
When asked why he returned to his alma mater, Bryant replied, &quot;Mama called. And when Mama calls, you just have to come runnin&#x27;.&quot; Bryant&#x27;s first spring practice back at Alabama was much like what happened at Junction. Some of Bryant&#x27;s assistants thought it was even more difficult, as dozens of players quit the team. After winning a combined four games in the three years before Bryant&#x27;s arrival (including Alabama&#x27;s only winless season on the field in modern times), the Tide went 5–4–1 in Bryant&#x27;s first season. The next year, in 1959, Alabama beat Auburn and appeared in the inaugural Liberty Bowl, the first time the Crimson Tide had beaten Auburn or appeared in a bowl game in six years. In the 1960 season, Bryant led Alabama to a 8–1–2 record and a #9 ranking in the final AP Poll. In 1961, with quarterback Pat Trammell and football greats Lee Roy Jordan and Billy Neighbors, Alabama went 11–0 and defeated Arkansas 10–3 in the Sugar Bowl to claim the national championship.

The next three years (1962–1964) featured Joe Namath at quarterback and were among Bryant&#x27;s finest. The 1962 Crimson Tide went 10–1, and the season ended with a 17–0 victory in the Orange Bowl over Bud Wilkinson&#x27;s Oklahoma Sooners. The Crimson Tide finished #5 in the AP Poll The 1963 Crimson Tide went 9–2, and the ended with a 12–7 victory over Ole Miss in the Sugar Bowl, which was the first game between the two Southeastern Conference neighbors in almost twenty years, and only the second in thirty years. Alabama finished #8 in the AP Poll In 1964 the Tide went 10–0 in the regular season and won another national championship, but lost 21–17 to Texas in the Orange Bowl. The Tide ended up sharing the 1964 national title with Arkansas, as the Razorbacks won the Cotton Bowl Classic, and had beaten Texas in Austin. Before 1968, the AP and UPI polls gave out their championships before the bowl games (with the exception of the 1965 season). The AP ceased this practice before the 1968 season, but the UPI continued until 1973.

The 1965 Crimson Tide went 9–1–1 and repeated as champions after defeating Nebraska, 39–28, in the Orange Bowl. Coming off back-to-back national championship seasons, Bryant&#x27;s 1966 Alabama team went undefeated, beating a strong Nebraska team, 34–7, in the Sugar Bowl. However, Alabama finished third in the AP Poll behind Michigan State and champions Notre Dame, who had previously played to a 10–10 tie in a late regular season game. In a biography of Bryant written by Allen Barra, the author suggests that the major polling services refused to elect Alabama as national champion for a third straight year because of Alabama Governor George Wallace&#x27;s recent stand against integration.

The 1967 Alabama team was billed as another national championship contender with star quarterback Kenny Stabler returning, but they stumbled out of the gate and tied Florida State, 37–37, at Legion Field. Alabama finished the year #8 at 8–2–1, losing 20–16 in the Cotton Bowl Classic to Texas A&amp;M, coached by former Bryant player and assistant coach Gene Stallings. In 1968 Bryant again could not match his previous successes, as the team finished #17 went 8–3, losing to the Missouri, 35–10, in the Gator Bowl.

The 1969 and 1970 teams finished 6–5 and 6–5–1 respectively. After these disappointing efforts, many began to wonder if the 57-year-old Bryant was washed up. He himself began feeling the same way and considered either retiring from coaching or leaving college football for the National Football League (NFL).

For years, Bryant was accused of racism for refusing to recruit black players. (He had tried to do so at Kentucky in the late 40s but was denied by then University President, Herman Donovan.) Bryant said that the prevailing social climate and the overwhelming presence of noted segregationist George Wallace in Alabama, first as governor and then as a presidential candidate, did not let him do this. He finally was able to convince the administration to allow him to do so, leading to the recruitment of Wilbur Jackson as Alabama&#x27;s first black scholarship player who was recruited in 1969 and signed in the Spring of 1970. Junior-college transfer John Mitchell became the first black player for Alabama in 1971 because freshmen, thus Jackson, were not eligible to play at that time. They would both be a credit to the university by their conduct and play, thus widening the door and warming the welcome for many more to follow. By 1973, one-third of the team&#x27;s starters were black, and Mitchell became the Tide&#x27;s first black coach that season.

In 1971 Bryant began engineering a comeback. This included abandoning the pro-style offense tailored to departed quarterback Scott Hunter&#x27;s passing ability for the relatively new wishbone formation. Darrell Royal, the Texas football coach whose assistant, Emory Bellard virtually invented the wishbone, taught Bryant its basics, but Bryant developed successful variations of the wishbone that Royal had never used. The change helped make the remainder of the decade a successful one for the Crimson Tide.

The 1971 Alabama Crimson Tide football team went undefeated in the regular season and rose to #2 in the AP Poll, but were dominated by top-ranked Nebraska 38–6 in the Orange Bowl. In the 1972 season, Bryant led Alabama to a 10–0 start before falling to #9 Auburn in the Iron Bowl and #7 Texas in the Cotton Bowl.

Bryant&#x27;s 1973 squad went undefeated in the regular season and split national championships with Notre Dame. Notre Dame later defeated Alabama, 24–23, in the Sugar Bowl. The UPI thereafter moved its final poll until after the bowl games. The Crimson Tide fared very similarly in the 1974 season. The team went undefeated in the regular season but fell to the #9 Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl 13–11. The 1975 season started off with a 20–7 setback to the Missouri Tigers. Alabama won every game after that, including the Sugar Bowl over Penn State, to finish 11–1 but finished #3 in the final AP Poll. Alabama went 9–3 in the 1976 season. The Crimson Tide finished the season with a 36–6 victory over #7 UCLA in the Liberty Bowl. Alabama finished #11 in the final AP Poll In the 1977 season, Alabama suffered a 31–24 loss to Nebraska in the second game of the season. Alabama won every game after that including a 35–6 victory over #9 Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl but Notre Dame ended up as National Champions and Alabama was ranked #2.

The 1978 Alabama Crimson Tide football team split the national title with USC despite losing to the Trojans in September. The Trojans lost later in the year to three-loss Arizona State and drop to number3. At the end of the year, number2 Alabama would beat undefeated and top-ranked Penn State in the Sugar Bowl, with the famous late-game goal line stand to preserve the victory.

Bryant won his sixth and final national title in 1979 after a 24–9 Sugar Bowl victory over Arkansas to cap a 12–0 season. Bryant led Alabama to a 10–2 record and a #6 ranking in the final AP Poll in the 1980 season. The season ended with a 30–2 victory over #6 Baylor in the Cotton Bowl. In 1981, Bryant led the Crimson Tide to a 9–2–1 record and a #7 ranking in the final AP Poll.

Bryant coached at Alabama for twenty-five years, winning six national titles (1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978, and 1979) and thirteen SEC championships. Bryant&#x27;s win over in-state rival Auburn, coached by former Bryant assistant Pat Dye on November 28, 1981, was Bryant&#x27;s 315th as a head coach, which was the most of any head coach at that time. His all-time record as a coach was 323–85–17.

==Personal life and death==
Bryant was a heavy smoker and drinker for most of his life, and his health began to decline in the late 1970s. He collapsed due to a cardiac episode in 1977 and decided to enter alcohol rehab, but resumed drinking after only a few months of sobriety. Bryant experienced a mild stroke in 1980 that weakened the left side of his body, another cardiac episode in 1981, and was taking a battery of medications in his final years.

Shortly before his death, Bryant met with evangelist Robert Schuller on a plane flight and the two talked extensively about religion, which apparently made an impression on the coach.

After a sixth-place SEC finish in the 1982 season that included losses to LSU and Tennessee, each for the first time since 1970, Bryant, who had turned 69 that September, announced his retirement, stating, &quot;This is my school, my alma mater. I love it and I love my players. But in my opinion, they deserved better coaching than they have been getting from me this year.&quot; His final loss was to Auburn in Bo Jackson&#x27;s freshman season. His last game was a 21–15 victory in the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, Tennessee, over the University of Illinois. After the game, Bryant was asked what he planned to do now that he was retired. He replied, &quot;Probably croak in a week.&quot;

Four weeks after making that comment, and just one day after passing a routine medical checkup, on January 25, 1983, Bryant checked into Druid City Hospital in Tuscaloosa after experiencing chest pain. A day later, when being prepared for an electrocardiogram, he died after suffering a massive heart attack.

His personal physician, Dr. William Hill, said that he was amazed that Bryant had been able to coach Alabama to two national championships in what would be the last five years of his life, given the poor state of his health. First news of Bryant&#x27;s death came from Bert Bank (WTBC Radio Tuscaloosa) and on the NBC Radio Network (anchored by Stan Martyn and reported by Stewart Stogel). On his hand at the time of his death was the only piece of jewelry he ever wore, a gold ring inscribed &quot;Junction Boys&quot;. He is interred at Birmingham&#x27;s Elmwood Cemetery. A month after his death, Bryant was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian award, by President Ronald Reagan. A moment of silence was held before Super Bowl XVII, played four days after Bryant&#x27;s death.

==Defamation suit==
In 1962 Bryant filed a libel suit against &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; for printing an article by Furman Bisher (&quot;College Football Is Going Berserk&quot;) that charged him with encouraging his players to engage in brutality in a 1961 game against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Six months later, the magazine published &quot;The Story of a College Football Fix&quot; that charged Bryant and Georgia Bulldogs athletic director and ex-coach Wally Butts with conspiring to fix their 1962 game together in Alabama&#x27;s favor. Butts also sued Curtis Publishing Co. for libel. The case was decided in Butts&#x27; favor in the US District Court of Northern Georgia in August 1963, but Curtis Publishing appealed to the Supreme Court. As a result of &quot;Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts&quot; 388 U.S. 130 (1967), Curtis Publishing was ordered to pay $3,060,000 in damages to Butts. The case is considered a landmark case because it established conditions under which a news organization can be held liable for defamation of a &quot;public figure&quot;. Bryant reached a separate out-of-court settlement on both of his cases for $300,000 against Curtis Publishing in January 1964.

==Legacy==
Many of Bryant&#x27;s former players and assistant coaches went on to become head coaches at the collegiate level and in the National Football League. Danny Ford (Clemson, 1981), Howard Schnellenberger (Miami of Florida, 1983), and Gene Stallings (Alabama, 1992), one of the Junction Boys, all won national championships as head coaches for NCAA programs while Joey Jones, Mike Riley, and David Cutcliffe are active head coaches in the NCAA. Charles McClendon, Jerry Claiborne, Sylvester Croom, Jim Owens, Jackie Sherrill, Bill Battle, Bud Moore and Pat Dye were also notable NCAA head coaches. Croom was the SEC&#x27;s first African-American head coach at Mississippi State from 2004 through 2008.

Super Bowl LV winning NFL head coach Bruce Arians was a running backs coach under Bryant in 1981–82. Arians also served as a successful head coach of the Arizona Cardinals, leading them to just their second ever appearance in the NFC Championship Game in 2015.

Ozzie Newsome, who played for Bryant at Alabama from 1974 to 1977, played professional football for the Cleveland Browns for thirteen seasons (1978–1990), and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999. Newsome was the general manager of the Cleveland Browns-Baltimore Ravens from 1996 through 2018. Newsome was the GM of the Ravens&#x27; Super Bowl XXXV championship team in 2000, and their Super Bowl XLVII championship team in 2012.

Jack Pardee, one of the Junction Boys, played linebacker in the NFL for sixteen seasons with the Los Angeles Rams and Washington Redskins, was a college head coach at the University of Houston, and an NFL head coach with Chicago, Washington, and Houston.

Bryant was portrayed by Gary Busey in the 1984 film &quot;The Bear&quot;, by Sonny Shroyer in the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, Tom Berenger in the 2002 film &quot;The Junction Boys&quot;, and Jon Voight in the 2015 film &quot;Woodlawn&quot;. Bryant is also mentioned as one of the titular &#x27;Three Great Alabama Icons&#x27; in the song of the same name by the Drive-By Truckers on their album &quot;Southern Rock Opera&quot;.

In a 1980 interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Bryant admitted that he had been too hard on the Junction Boys and &quot;If I were one of their players, I probably would have quit too.&quot;

==Head coaching record==
In his 38 seasons as a head coach, Bryant had 37 winning seasons and participated in a total of 29 postseason bowl games, including 24 consecutively at Alabama. He won fifteen bowl games, including eight Sugar Bowls. Bryant still holds the records as the youngest college football head coach to win three hundred games and compile thirty winning seasons.

<doc id="297489" wikidata="Q1661095" url="?curid=297489" title="Independent Games Festival">
<text>The Independent Games Festival (IGF) is an annual festival at the Game Developers Conference (GDC), the largest annual gathering of the independent video game industry. Originally founded in 1998 to promote independent video game developers, and innovation in video game development by CMP Media, later known as UBM Technology Group, IGF is now owned by Informa after UBM&#x27;s acquisition.

The IGF competition awards a total of $50,000 in prizes to independent developers in Main Competition and Student Competition categories and held around the same time as the Game Developers Choice Awards event.

From 2007 to 2010, there was a separate event called IGF Mobile for mobile phone games.

==Competition Structure==
The festival awards ceremony is split into two broad categories: the main IGF competition and the IGF Student Showcase.

The main Independent Games Festival, held in March 2012 at San Francisco&#x27;s GDC 2012, distributed nine major awards:

*Seumas McNally Grand Prize ($30,000)
*Nuovo Award ($5,000)
*Excellence In Visual Art ($3,000)
*Excellence In Audio ($3,000)
*Excellence in Design ($3,000)
*Technical Excellence ($3,000)
*Best Mobile Game ($3,000)
*Audience Award ($3,000)

An additional award, &quot;Excellent in Narrative&quot;, was added for the 2013 IGF.

In addition, the IGF&#x27;s Student Showcase competition gives out the following awards each year:

*IGF Student Showcase Winner (eight winners, $500)
*Best Student Game ($3000)

Prior to the Festival, developers have the opportunity to submit their game in a playable state to the IGF organization committee for a small fee. These titles are then sent to approximately 300 game industry representatives on the Nominating Committee; these representatives include both indie developers and more mainstream developers and publishers. Each Committee member can nominate any of the provided games to one or more of the categories. Then, for each award category, a pre-selected jury of between seven and fifteen members reviews the nominations and makes a final selection of six finalists (eight for the Nuovo award) and a number of honorable mentions.

The selected finalists are expected to present their games at the IGF during the Games Developers Conference; the show provides them a booth space and access to the convention, but finalists either must secure their own travel and lodgings, or name a proxy to demonstrate their games. During the convention, a separate jury selected by the IGF organization committee will review each game, and just prior to the awards, vote for one game in each category. The only exception is the Audience Award, which is voted through online forms by anyone interested.

<doc id="297492" wikidata="Q933789" url="?curid=297492" title="Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent">
<text>Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent (135025 April 1397) was an English nobleman and a councillor of his half-brother, King Richard II of England.

==Family and early life==
Thomas Holland was born in Upholland, Lancashire, in 1350. He was the eldest surviving son of Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent, and Joan &quot;The Fair Maid of Kent&quot;. His mother was a daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, and Margaret Wake. Edmund was in turn a son of Edward I of England and his second Queen consort Marguerite of France, and thus a younger half-brother of Edward II of England.

His father died in 1360, and later that year, on 28 December, Thomas became Baron Holand. His mother was still Countess of Kent in her own right, and in 1361 she married Edward, the Black Prince, the son of King Edward III.

==Military career==
At sixteen, in 1366, Holland was appointed captain of the English forces in Aquitaine. Over the next decade he fought in various campaigns, including the Battle of Nájera, under the command of his stepfather Edward, the Black Prince. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1375.

Richard II became king in 1377, and soon Holland acquired great influence over his younger half-brother, which he used for his own enrichment. In 1381, he succeeded as Earl of Kent.

==Later years and death==
Prior to his death, Holland was appointed Governor of Carisbrooke Castle. Holland died at Arundel Castle, Sussex, England on 25 April 1397.

==Titles==
* 2nd Earl of Kent (26 December 1360 – 25 April 1397) of the 1360 creation
* 5th Earl of Kent (7 August 1385 – 25 April 1397) of the 1321 creation
* 2nd Baron Holand (26 December 1360 – 25 April 1397) of the 1353 creation
* 6th Baron Wake of Liddell (7 August 1385 – 25 April 1397) of the 1295 creation

==Marriage and children==
On 10 April 1364 Holland married Lady Alice FitzAlan, daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel by his wife Eleanor of Lancaster. By his wife he had four sons and six daughters. All the sons died without legitimate children, whereupon the daughters and their children became co-heiresses to the House of Holland. The children were as follows:

===Sons===
# Thomas Holland, 3rd Earl of Kent, 1st Duke of Surrey (8 September 1372 – 7 January 1400), eldest son and heir, created Duke of Surrey. Died without children.
# John Holland (2 November 1374 – 5 November 1394), second son, died without children
# Richard Holland (3 April 1376 – 21 May 1396), third son
# Edmund Holland, 4th Earl of Kent (9 January 1382 – 15 September 1408), heir to his elder brother. Died without legitimate children, but had an illegitimate child by his mistress Constance of York.

===Daughters===

By his daughters&#x27; marriages, he became the ancestor of many of the prominent figures in the Wars of the Roses, including Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York (father of Kings Edward IV and Richard III), Henry Tudor (later King Henry VII), and Warwick the Kingmaker, father of queen consort Anne Neville. He was also an ancestor of queen consort Catherine Parr, the sixth and last wife of King Henry VIII. His daughters were as follows:

# Eleanor I Holland, &quot;alias&quot; Alianore (13 October 1370 – 23 October 1405). Married firstly to Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March (1374–1398), for a time heir presumptive to his mother&#x27;s first cousin King Richard II, and left children. Following the deposition of Richard II in 1399 by his own first cousin, Henry IV, the claim to the throne of England was pursued by Roger&#x27;s and Alianore&#x27;s grandson Richard, Duke of York (1411–1460), the drawn-out struggle of which formed the basis for the Wars of the Roses. Secondly, she married Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton, and left children.
# Joan Holland (c. 1380 – 12 April 1434), married Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York
# Margaret Holland (1385 – 31 December 1439), married first John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, and second Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence
# Elizabeth Holland, who married Sir John Neville (c.1387–1420), eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and by him had three sons, Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland, John Neville, Baron Neville, and Sir Thomas Neville, and a daughter, Margaret Neville.
# Eleanor II Holland (1386 – after 1413), who bore the same first name as her eldest sister, married Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury
# Bridget Holland, who became a nun

<doc id="297493" wikidata="Q2525646" url="?curid=297493" title="Composition series">
<text>In abstract algebra, a composition series provides a way to break up an algebraic structure, such as a group or a module, into simple pieces. The need for considering composition series in the context of modules arises from the fact that many naturally occurring modules are not semisimple, hence cannot be decomposed into a direct sum of simple modules. A composition series of a module &quot;M&quot; is a finite increasing filtration of &quot;M&quot; by submodules such that the successive quotients are simple and serves as a replacement of the direct sum decomposition of &quot;M&quot; into its simple constituents. 

A composition series may not exist, and when it does, it need not be unique. Nevertheless, a group of results known under the general name Jordan–Hölder theorem asserts that whenever composition series exist, the &quot;isomorphism classes&quot; of simple pieces (although, perhaps, not their &quot;location&quot; in the composition series in question) and their multiplicities are uniquely determined. Composition series may thus be used to define invariants of finite groups and Artinian modules.

A related but distinct concept is a chief series: a composition series is a maximal &quot;subnormal&quot; series, while a chief series is a maximal &quot;normal series&quot;.

==For groups==
If a group &quot;G&quot; has a normal subgroup &quot;N&quot;, then the factor group &quot;G&quot;/&quot;N&quot; may be formed, and some aspects of the study of the structure of &quot;G&quot; may be broken down by studying the &quot;smaller&quot; groups &quot;G/N&quot; and &quot;N&quot;. If &quot;G&quot; has no normal subgroup that is different from &quot;G&quot; and from the trivial group, then &quot;G&quot; is a simple group. Otherwise, the question naturally arises as to whether &quot;G&quot; can be reduced to simple &quot;pieces&quot;, and if so, whether there are any unique features of the way this can be done.

More formally, a composition series of a group &quot;G&quot; is a subnormal series of finite length
:formula_1
with strict inclusions, such that each &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a maximal proper normal subgroup of &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1. Equivalently, a composition series is a subnormal series such that each factor group &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 / &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot; is simple. The factor groups are called composition factors.

A subnormal series is a composition series if and only if it is of maximal length. That is, there are no additional subgroups which can be &quot;inserted&quot; into a composition series. The length &quot;n&quot; of the series is called the composition length.

If a composition series exists for a group &quot;G&quot;, then any subnormal series of &quot;G&quot; can be &quot;refined&quot; to a composition series, informally, by inserting subgroups into the series up to maximality. Every finite group has a composition series, but not every infinite group has one. For example, formula_2 has no composition series.

===Uniqueness: Jordan–Hölder theorem===
A group may have more than one composition series. However, the Jordan–Hölder theorem (named after Camille Jordan and Otto Hölder) states that any two composition series of a given group are equivalent. That is, they have the same composition length and the same composition factors, up to permutation and isomorphism. This theorem can be proved using the Schreier refinement theorem. The Jordan–Hölder theorem is also true for transfinite &quot;ascending&quot; composition series, but not transfinite &quot;descending&quot; composition series . 
 gives a short proof of the Jordan–Hölder theorem by intersecting the terms in one subnormal series with those in the other series.

====Example====
For a cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot;, composition series correspond to ordered prime factorizations of &quot;n&quot;, and in fact yields a proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

For example, the cyclic group formula_3 has formula_4 and formula_5 as three different composition series. The sequences of composition factors obtained in the respective cases are formula_6 and formula_7

==For modules==

The definition of composition series for modules restricts all attention to submodules, ignoring all additive subgroups that are &quot;not&quot; submodules. Given a ring &quot;R&quot; and an &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, a composition series for &quot;M&quot; is a series of submodules 

:formula_8

where all inclusions are strict and &quot;J&quot;&quot;k&quot; is a maximal submodule of &quot;J&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1 for each &quot;k&quot;. As for groups, if &quot;M&quot; has a composition series at all, then any finite strictly increasing series of submodules of &quot;M&quot; may be refined to a composition series, and any two composition series for &quot;M&quot; are equivalent. In that case, the (simple) quotient modules &quot;J&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1/&quot;J&quot;&quot;k&quot; are known as the composition factors of &quot;M,&quot; and the Jordan–Hölder theorem holds, ensuring that the number of occurrences of each isomorphism type of simple &quot;R&quot;-module as a composition factor does not depend on the choice of composition series. 

It is well known that a module has a finite composition series if and only if it is both an Artinian module and a Noetherian module. If &quot;R&quot; is an Artinian ring, then every finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-module is Artinian and Noetherian, and thus has a finite composition series. In particular, for any field &quot;K&quot;, any finite-dimensional module for a finite-dimensional algebra over &quot;K&quot; has a composition series, unique up to equivalence.

==Generalization==
Groups with a set of operators generalize group actions and ring actions on a group. A unified approach to both groups and modules can be followed as in or , simplifying some of the exposition. The group &quot;G&quot; is viewed as being acted upon by elements (operators) from a set Ω. Attention is restricted entirely to subgroups invariant under the action of elements from Ω, called Ω-subgroups. Thus Ω-composition series must use only Ω-subgroups, and Ω-composition factors need only be Ω-simple. The standard results above, such as the Jordan–Hölder theorem, are established with nearly identical proofs.

The special cases recovered include when Ω = &quot;G&quot; so that &quot;G&quot; is acting on itself. An important example of this is when elements of &quot;G&quot; act by conjugation, so that the set of operators consists of the inner automorphisms. A composition series under this action is exactly a chief series. Module structures are a case of Ω-actions where Ω is a ring and some additional axioms are satisfied.

==For objects in an abelian category==
A composition series of an object &quot;A&quot; in an abelian category is a sequence of subobjects
:formula_9
such that each quotient object &quot;Xi&quot; /&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; + 1 is simple (for ). If &quot;A&quot; has a composition series, the integer &quot;n&quot; only depends on &quot;A&quot; and is called the length of &quot;A&quot;.

<doc id="297497" wikidata="Q700739" url="?curid=297497" title="Tongyong Pinyin">
<text>Tongyong Pinyin was the official romanization of Mandarin in Taiwan between 2002 and 2008. The system was unofficially used between 2000 and 2002, when a new romanization system for Taiwan was being evaluated for adoption. Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Education approved the system in 2002, but its use was optional.

Since 1 January 2009, the Ministry of Education began promoting Hanyu Pinyin. Local governments would not be able to get financial aid from the central government if they used Tongyong Pinyin-derived romanizations. After this policy change, Tongyong Pinyin has been used for the transliteration of some place names and personal names in Taiwan (Republic of China). Some of the romanized names of the districts, subway stations and streets in Kaohsiung, Tainan, Taichung, Yunlin County and other places are derived from Tongyong Pinyin for example, Cijin District (, &quot;Cíjin Cyu&quot;).

==History==

The impetus behind the invention of Tongyong Pinyin came from the need for a standardized romanization system. For decades, the island had employed various systems, usually simplifications or adaptations of Wade–Giles.

Zhuyin, a standard phonetic system for language education in Taiwan&#x27;s schools, does not use the Latin alphabet.

Tongyong Pinyin was introduced in 1998 by Yu Bor-chuan to preserve the strengths of Hanyu Pinyin while eliminating some of the pronunciation difficulties Hanyu presents to international readers, such as difficulties with the letters &quot;q&quot; and &quot;x&quot;. Yu&#x27;s system was subsequently revised.

Discussion and adoption of Tongyong Pinyin, like many other initiatives in Taiwan, quickly acquired a partisan tone turning on issues of Chinese versus Taiwanese identity. Officials who identified most strongly with the nation itself, such as the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its allied parties, saw no reason to adopt Hanyu Pinyin just because mainland China and the UN had. If Tongyong Pinyin more adequately met the nation&#x27;s needs, they saw this as ample justification for Taiwan to adopt it. Officials who identified more strongly with Chinese culture, such as the Kuomintang (KMT), saw no reason to introduce a new system unique to Taiwan if Hanyu Pinyin had already gained international acceptance. Each side accused the other of basing its preference on anti-China or pro-China sentiment rather than an objective discussion of community goals.

In early October 2000, the Mandarin Commission of the Ministry of Education proposed to use Tongyong Pinyin as the national standard. Education Minister Ovid Tzeng submitted a draft of the Taiwanese romanization in late October to the Executive Yuan, but the proposal was rejected. In November 2000, Tzeng unsuccessfully suggested that the government adopt Hanyu Pinyin with some modifications for local dialects. On 10 July 2002, Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Education held a meeting for 27 members. Only 13 attended. Two left early, and since the chairman could not vote, the bill for using Tongyong Pinyin was passed with 10 votes.

In August 2002, the government adopted Tongyong Pinyin by an administrative order that local governments had the authority to override within their jurisdiction. In October 2007, with the DPP administration still in power, it was announced that Taiwan would standardize the English transliterations of its Chinese Mandarin place names by the end of the year, after years of confusion from multiple spellings, by using the locally developed Tongyong Pinyin.

In 2008, the Kuomintang won both the legislative and presidential elections. In September 2008, it was announced that Tongyong Pinyin would be replaced by Hanyu Pinyin as Taiwan&#x27;s standard, at the end of the year. Since 1 January 2009, Hanyu Pinyin has been an official romanization system in Taiwan.

On 24 August 2020, the Taichung City Council decided to use Tongyong Pinyin in the translated names of the stations on the Green line (Taichung Metro).


==Adoption and use==
Tongyong Pinyin was the official romanization system in Taiwan, but its use was voluntary. The romanization system that one encounters in Taiwan varies according to the government authority that administers the facility. Street signs in most areas use Tongyong Pinyin, including the cities of Kaohsiung, Tainan, and surrounding counties. A contrast could be seen in the two entities that now make up the municipality of Taichung–Taichung County used Tongyong Pinyin while Taichung City has used Hanyu Pinyin since at least 2004. Then-mayor Ma Ying-jeou remained committed to using Hanyu Pinyin as the Romanization standard for Taipei. Taipei County (now New Taipei City) used Tongyong Pinyin, but in Taipei Metro stations, Tongyong Pinyin was given in parentheses after Hanyu Pinyin. Modified Wade–Giles spellings are popularly used for many proper names, especially personal names and businesses.

The political impasse prevented Ministry of Education from being able to replace Zhuyin in teaching pronunciation in elementary school. Zhuyin is widely used to teach Mandarin pronunciation to schoolchildren. Children&#x27;s books published in Taiwan typically display Zhuyin characters next to Chinese characters in the text.

On 17 September 2008, the Ministry of Education announced that the government standard for romanization would be switched to Hanyu Pinyin nationwide, effective 1 January 2009. However, people in Taiwan can freely choose their foreign language names. So although Tongyong Pinyin was effectively scrapped as the romanization standard of Taiwan&#x27;s central government, many today choose a romanized form of their Chinese character name that is created based on the Tongyong Pinyin, Wade–Giles, or Yale romanization systems.

Today, districts of Kaohsiung are named by Tongyong. Districts of Tainan are mostly named by Tongyong with exceptions such as Xinying.

==Taiwanese language variant==
The Tongyong Pinyin system also exists in a Taiwanese Hokkien phonetic symbol version, Daighi tongiong pingim, which lacks &quot;f&quot; but adds &quot;bh&quot;. However, in 2006, the Ministry of Education rejected the use of Daighi tongiong pingim for Taiwanese Hokkien and preferred the Taiwanese Romanization System.

==Features==

===Spelling===
Some notable features of Tongyong Pinyin are:

* The first tone is unmarked.
* Hanyu Pinyin&#x27;s &quot;zh-&quot; becomes &quot;jh-&quot; (Wade–Giles uses &quot;ch-&quot;).
* Hanyu Pinyin&#x27;s &quot;x-&quot; and &quot;q-&quot; are not used in Tongyong Pinyin and become &quot;s-&quot; and &quot;c-&quot; (Wade–Giles uses &quot;hs-&quot; and &quot;ch&#x27;-&quot;).
* The Hanyu Pinyin &quot;-i&quot; (not represented in Zhuyin) known as the empty rhyme (), are shown as &quot;-ih&quot; (somewhat like Wade–Giles): those in Hanyu Pinyin as &quot;zi&quot; (), &quot;ci&quot; (), &quot;si&quot; (), &quot;zhi&quot; (), &quot;chi&quot; (), &quot;shi&quot; (), and &quot;ri&quot; () all end in &quot;-ih&quot; in Tongyong Pinyin.

* &quot;ü&quot; used in Hanyu Pinyin (written &quot;u&quot; after &quot;j&quot;, &quot;q&quot; and &quot;x&quot;) is replaced by &quot;yu&quot;.

* &quot;-eng&quot; becomes &quot;ong&quot; after &quot;f-&quot; and &quot;w-&quot; ().
* &quot;wen&quot; () becomes &quot;wun&quot;.
* &quot;-iong&quot; becomes &quot;yong&quot;: &quot;syong&quot; instead of pinyin &quot;xiong&quot; () (cf. &quot;-iang&quot; remains unchanged: &quot;siang&quot;).
* Unlike in Wade–Giles and Hanyu Pinyin, &quot;-iu&quot; and &quot;-ui&quot; (&quot;liu&quot; [] and &quot;gui&quot; []), contractions can be written out in full as &quot;-iou&quot; and &quot;-uei&quot;. According to the Ministry of the Interior, in romanizations of names of places that is at township-level or below township-level, the letters must be written in full.

===Punctuation===
* Tongyong syllables in the same word (except placenames) are to be separated by hyphens, like Wade–Giles, but in the Ministry of the Interior&#x27;s romanizations, placenames have no spaces between the syllables.
* Tongyong uses tone closer to those used in Zhuyin, than Hanyu Pinyin: it has no mark for the first tone, but uses a small ring for the neutral tone (optional on computers).
===Shared features with Hanyu Pinyin===
If tone is ignored, 19.47% of Tongyong Pinyin syllables are spelled differently to those of Hanyu Pinyin. The difference widens when syllables are measured according to average frequency of use in everyday life to a 48.84% difference in spellings. In two cases (&quot;si&quot; and &quot;ci&quot;) the same Latin spelling denotes different syllables depending on the transcription system.

==Arguments==

The prevalence of Hanyu Pinyin as an established system weighs at least as heavily on the debate over Tongyong Pinyin as any feature of the system itself. There are many arguments for the use of each. Some factors cited in support of Tongyong Pinyin include the following.
* Tongyong Pinyin is business-friendly because of the ease it offers in pronunciation. Visitors to Taiwan can thus more easily describe and find place names, personal names, businesses and locales.
* Tongyong Pinyin requires no more special accommodation in international correspondence than the difference in Chinese characters (simplified vs. traditional) already requires.
* Tongyong strikes a balance between the need for internationalization and Taiwan&#x27;s local needs.
* Tongyong Pinyin would not supplant Hanyu Pinyin in Taiwan, as Hanyu Pinyin is rarely encountered outside the Taipei area anyway and has never been in common use. Tongyong Pinyin is intended to supplant the many variants of Wade–Giles that remain the dominant form of romanization encountered in Taiwan. No one questions the superiority of Tongyong Pinyin to Wade–Giles and the benefit to be gained from the change.
* Tongyong does not force its exclusive use on those who have already studied Hanyu Pinyin. One can use any system to render characters while one types or formats documents in Mandarin. Computers and electronic devices in Taiwan already offer Hanyu Pinyin and MPS keyboards as options. Transitions between romanized forms are also easily achieved if needed.
* Romanization is most useful to individuals who lack training in Mandarin but encounter names and terms in press reports and literature. Students of Mandarin gain literacy in Chinese characters and drop romanization systems of any kind. 
Some argue against the system. The reasons they cite include:
* The standard romanization system of Mainland China, the International Organization for Standardization, and the United Nations is Hanyu Pinyin. 
* Tongyong Pinyin creates a third form of spelling/transliteration, adding complexity. For example, &quot;Qing dynasty&quot; (via Hanyu Pinyin) and &quot;Ch&#x27;ing dynasty&quot; (via Wade–Giles) is spelled as &quot;Cing dynasty&quot; (via Tongyong Pinyin). Persons doing research on this time period thus would need to know that all three terms in fact refer to the same dynasty.

==Comparison with other orthographies==

The differences between Tongyong Pinyin and Hanyu Pinyin are relatively straightforward:
* The palatalized consonants are written &quot;j, c, s&quot; rather than &quot;j, q, x&quot;.
* The retroflex consonants are &quot;jh, ch, sh&quot; rather than &quot;zh, ch, sh&quot;.
* The &quot;buzzing&quot; vowels are written &quot;ih (shih, sih)&quot; rather than &quot;i (shi, si)&quot;.
* &quot;Yu&quot; and &quot;yong&quot; are still spelled with a &#x27;y&#x27; even after a consonant &quot;(nyu, ),&quot; rather than as &quot;ü, u,&quot; or &quot;iong&quot;.
* &quot;You&quot; and &quot;wei&quot; are written &quot;iou&quot; and &quot;uei&quot; after a consonant &quot;(diou, duei),&quot; rather than contracted to &quot;iu&quot; and &quot;ui&quot;.
* &quot;Eng&quot; is written labialized &quot;ong&quot; after the labial consonants &quot;f, w (fong, wong),&quot; but &quot;weng/wong&quot; contracts to &quot;ong&quot; after another consonant in both systems.
* &quot;Wen&quot; becomes &quot;wun&quot;.
* Neutral tone is marked, but not first tone.

<text>Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey, 3rd Earl of Kent, KG, Earl Marshal (8 September 1372 – 7 January 1400) was an English nobleman and courtier.

==Early life and family==

Born on 8 September 1372, Thomas Holland was the eldest son and heir of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent (1350–1397), and Alice FitzAlan, daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 3rd Earl of Arundel. His father was a maternal half-brother of King Richard II, and the younger Thomas had two brothers and six sisters.

Shortly after 20 October 1392, Thomas Holland married Joan Stafford, daughter of Hugh, Earl of Stafford. They had 2 children. In 1394 he and his father accompanied the king to Ireland.
On his father&#x27;s death in 1397 he succeeded him as 3rd Earl of Kent and 4th Baron Holland. At that time Kent&#x27;s uncle King Richard II was removing the Duke of Gloucester and his associates from power, and sent Kent to arrest his own uncle, the Earl of Arundel. In reward he received a share of the forfeited estates, and on 29 September 1397 was created Duke of Surrey. Another uncle, the Earl of Huntingdon, was created Duke of Exeter on that day as well. In 1398 he founded Mount Grace Priory in Yorkshire.

==Last years and execution==

Surrey, along with many of King Richard II&#x27;s advisors, was arrested after the King&#x27;s deposition by King Henry IV in 1399. In the end he had to forfeit the honours and estates he had gained after the arrests of Gloucester and Arundel, in particular the Dukedom of Surrey, although he retained the Earldom of Kent.

Early in 1400, Kent, along with his uncle, the Earl of Huntingdon (no longer Duke of Exeter), plotted to kill King Henry IV and free King Richard II from prison and return him to the throne. This &quot;Epiphany Rising&quot; failed and Kent was captured and executed.

He was succeeded as Earl of Kent by his brother Edmund.

<text>In mathematics, a Lie superalgebra is a generalisation of a Lie algebra to include a formula_1grading. Lie superalgebras are important in theoretical physics where they are used to describe the mathematics of supersymmetry. 

The notion of formula_1 grading used here is distinct from a second formula_1 grading having cohomological origins. A graded Lie algebra (say, graded by formula_4 or formula_5) that is anticommutative and has a graded Jacobi identity also has a formula_1 grading; this is the &quot;rolling up&quot; of the algebra into odd and even parts. This rolling-up is not normally referred to as &quot;super&quot;. Thus, supergraded Lie superalgebras carry a &quot;pair&quot; of formula_1gradations: one of which is supersymmetric, and the other is classical. Pierre Deligne calls the supersymmetric one the &quot;super gradation&quot;, and the classical one the &quot;cohomological gradation&quot;. These two gradations must be compatible, and there is often disagreement as to how they should be regarded.

==Definition==
Formally, a Lie superalgebra is a nonassociative Z2-graded algebra, or &quot;superalgebra&quot;, over a commutative ring (typically R or C) whose product [·, ·], called the Lie superbracket or supercommutator, satisfies the two conditions (analogs of the usual Lie algebra axioms, with grading):

Super skew-symmetry:

:formula_8

The super Jacobi identity:

:formula_9

where &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; are pure in the Z2-grading. Here, |&quot;x&quot;| denotes the degree of &quot;x&quot; (either 0 or 1). The degree of [x,y] is the sum of degree of x and y modulo 2.

One also sometimes adds the axioms formula_10 for |&quot;x&quot;| = 0 (if 2 is invertible this follows automatically) and formula_11 for |&quot;x&quot;| = 1 (if 3 is invertible this follows automatically). When the ground ring is the integers or the Lie superalgebra is a free module, these conditions are equivalent to the condition that the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem holds (and, in general, they are necessary conditions for the theorem to hold).

Just as for Lie algebras, the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie superalgebra can be given a Hopf algebra structure.

== Comments == 
Lie superalgebras show up in physics in several different ways. In conventional supersymmetry, the &quot;even&quot; elements of the superalgebra correspond to bosons and &quot;odd&quot; elements to fermions. This corresponds to a bracket that has a grading of zero:
:formula_12

This is not always the case; for example, in BRST supersymmetry and in the Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism, it is the other way around, which corresponds to the bracket of having a grading of -1: 
:formula_13

This distinction becomes particularly relevant when an algebra has not one, but two graded associative products. In addition to the Lie bracket, there may also be an &quot;ordinary&quot; product, thus giving rise to the Poisson superalgebra and the Gerstenhaber algebra. Such gradings are also observed in deformation theory.

== Properties ==
Let formula_14 be a Lie superalgebra. By inspecting the Jacobi identity, one sees that there are eight cases depending on whether arguments are even or odd. These fall into four classes, indexed by the number of odd elements:

# No odd elements. The statement is just that formula_15 is an ordinary Lie algebra.
# One odd element. Then formula_16 is a formula_15-module for the action formula_18.
# Two odd elements. The Jacobi identity says that the bracket formula_19 is a &quot;symmetric&quot; formula_16-map.
# Three odd elements. For all formula_21, formula_22.

Thus the even subalgebra formula_15 of a Lie superalgebra forms a (normal) Lie algebra as all the signs disappear, and the superbracket becomes a normal Lie bracket, while formula_16 is a linear representation of formula_15, and there exists a symmetric formula_15-equivariant linear map formula_27 such that,

:formula_28

Conditions (1)–(3) are linear and can all be understood in terms of ordinary Lie algebras. Condition (4) is nonlinear, and is the most difficult one to verify when constructing a Lie superalgebra starting from an ordinary Lie algebra (formula_15) and a representation (formula_16).

==Involution==
A formula_31 Lie superalgebra is a complex Lie superalgebra equipped with an involutive antilinear map from itself to itself which respects the Z2 grading and satisfies
[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;]* = [&quot;y&quot;*,&quot;x&quot;*] for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in the Lie superalgebra. (Some authors prefer the convention [&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;]* = (−1)|&quot;x&quot;||&quot;y&quot;|[&quot;y&quot;*,&quot;x&quot;*]; changing * to −* switches between the two conventions.) Its universal enveloping algebra would be an ordinary *-algebra.

==Examples==
Given any associative superalgebra formula_32 one can define the supercommutator on homogeneous elements by

:formula_33

and then extending by linearity to all elements. The algebra formula_32 together with the supercommutator then becomes a Lie superalgebra. The simplest example of this procedure is perhaps when formula_32 is the space of all linear functions formula_36 of a super vector space formula_37 to itself. When formula_38, this space is denoted by formula_39 or formula_40. With the Lie bracket per above, the space is denoted formula_41.

A Poisson algebra is an associative algebra together with a Lie bracket. If the algebra is given a Z2-grading, such that the Lie bracket becomes a Lie superbracket, then one obtains the Poisson superalgebra. If, in addition, the associative product is made supercommutative, one obtains a supercommutative Poisson superalgebra.

The Whitehead product on homotopy groups gives many examples of Lie superalgebras over the integers.

The super-Poincaré algebra generates the isometries of flat superspace.

==Classification==

The simple complex finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras were classified by Victor Kac.

They are (excluding the Lie algebras):

The special linear lie superalgebra formula_42.

The lie superalgebra formula_42 is the subalgebra of formula_44 consisting of matrices with super trace zero. It is simple when formula_45. If formula_46, then the identity matrix formula_47generates an ideal. Quotienting out this ideal leads to formula_48 which is simple for formula_49.

The orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra formula_50.

Consider an even, non-degenerate, supersymmetric bilinear form formula_51 on formula_52. Then the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra is the subalgebra of formula_53 consisting of matrices that leave this form invariant:formula_54 Its even part is given by formula_55.

The exceptional Lie superalgebra formula_56.

There is a family of (9∣8)-dimensional Lie superalgebras depending on a parameter formula_57. These are deformations of formula_58. If formula_59 and formula_60, then D(2,1,α) is simple. Moreover formula_61 if formula_57 and formula_63 are under the same orbit under the maps formula_64 and formula_65.

The exceptional Lie superalgebra formula_66.

It has dimension (24|16). Its even part is given by formula_67.

The exceptional Lie superalgebra formula_68.

It has dimension (17|14). Its even part is given by formula_69.

There are also two so-called strange series called formula_70 and formula_71.

The Cartan types. They can be divided in four families: formula_72, formula_73, formula_74 and formula_75. For the Cartan type of simple Lie superalgebras, the odd part is no longer completely reducible under the action of the even part. 

==Classification of infinite-dimensional simple linearly compact Lie superalgebras==
The classification consists of the 10 series W(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;), S(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) ((m, n) ≠ (1, 1)), H(2m, n), K(2&quot;m&quot; + 1, &quot;n&quot;), HO(m, m) (&quot;m&quot; ≥ 2), SHO(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;m&quot;) (&quot;m&quot; ≥ 3), KO(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;m&quot; + 1), SKO(m, m + 1; β) (&quot;m&quot; ≥ 2), SHO ~ (2&quot;m&quot;, 2&quot;m&quot;), SKO ~ (2&quot;m&quot; + 1, 2&quot;m&quot; + 3) and the five exceptional algebras:

::E(1, 6), E(5, 10), E(4, 4), E(3, 6), E(3, 8)

The last two are particularly interesting (according to Kac) because they have the standard model gauge group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) as their zero level algebra. Infinite-dimensional (affine) Lie superalgebras are important symmetries in superstring theory. Specifically, the Virasoro algebras with formula_76 supersymmetries are formula_77 which only have central extensions up to formula_78.

==Category-theoretic definition==

In category theory, a Lie superalgebra can be defined as a nonassociative superalgebra whose product satisfies

*formula_79
*formula_80
where σ is the cyclic permutation braiding formula_81. In diagrammatic form:

<doc id="297503" wikidata="Q123480" url="?curid=297503" title="Landlocked country">
<text>A landlocked country is a country that has no territory connected to an ocean or whose coastlines lie solely on endorheic basins. Currently, there are 44 landlocked countries, two of them doubly landlocked (Liechtenstein and Uzbekistan), and three landlocked de facto states in the world. Kazakhstan is the world&#x27;s largest landlocked country, Kyrgyzstan is the furthest landlocked country from any ocean, while Ethiopia is the world&#x27;s most populous landlocked country.

Generally, being landlocked creates political and economic disadvantages that having access to international waters would avoid. For this reason, nations large and small throughout history have fought to gain access to open waters, even at great expense in wealth, bloodshed, and political capital.

The economic disadvantages of being landlocked can be alleviated or aggravated depending on degree of development, surrounding trade routes and freedom of trade, commonality of language, and other considerations. Some landlocked countries in Europe are affluent, such as Andorra, Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, San Marino, Switzerland, and Vatican City, all of which, excluding Luxembourg (a founding member of NATO), frequently employ neutrality in global political issues.

However, 32 out of the 45 landlocked countries, including those in Africa, Asia, and South America, have been classified as Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) by the United Nations. Nine of the twelve countries with the lowest Human Development Index rankings are landlocked. International initiatives are aimed at reducing inequalities resulting from issues such as these, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10, which aims to reduce inequality substantially by 2030.

== History ==
In 1990, there were only 30 landlocked countries in the world. However, the dissolutions of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia; the breakup of Yugoslavia; the independence referendums of South Ossetia (de facto state), Eritrea, Montenegro, South Sudan, and the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic (de facto state); and the unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo (de facto state) created 15 new landlocked countries and five landlocked de facto states while the former landlocked country of Czechoslovakia ceased to exist on 1 January 1993.

On 30 September 2022, the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic (de facto state) was annexed by Russia and ceased to exist as a landlocked de facto state.

On 19 September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a new offensive against the Republic of Artsakh (de facto state) and achieved a decisive victory. The Government of Artsakh was officially dissolved on 1 January 2024. As a result, Artsakh ceased to exist as a landlocked de facto state and the Nagorno-Karabakh region was reintegrated into Azerbaijan.

As of 1 April 2024, there were 44 landlocked countries and three landlocked de facto states (Kosovo, South Ossetia, and Transnistria) in the world.

== Significance ==
Historically, being landlocked has been disadvantageous to a country&#x27;s development. It cuts a nation off from important sea resources such as fishing, and impedes or prevents direct access to maritime trade, a crucial component of economic and social advance. As such, coastal regions, or inland regions that have access to the World Ocean, tended to be wealthier and more heavily populated than inland regions that have no access to the World Ocean. Paul Collier in his book &quot;The Bottom Billion&quot; argues that being landlocked in a poor geographical neighbourhood is one of four major development &quot;traps&quot; by which a country can be held back. In general, he found that when a neighbouring country experiences better growth, it tends to spill over into favorable development for the country itself. For landlocked countries, the effect is particularly strong, as they are limited in their trading activity with the rest of the world. He states, &quot;If you are coastal, you serve the world; if you are landlocked, you serve your neighbors.&quot; Others have argued that being landlocked has an advantage as it creates a &quot;natural tariff barrier&quot; that protects the country from cheap imports. In some instances, this has led to more robust local food systems.

Landlocked developing countries have significantly higher costs of international cargo transportation compared to coastal developing countries (in Asia the ratio is 3:1).

Historically, traveling between a landlocked country and a country which did not border said country required the traveler to pass border controls twice or more. In recent times the advent of air travel has largely negated this impediment.

=== Actions to avoid being landlocked ===
Countries have acted to overcome being landlocked by acquiring land that reaches the sea:

* The Republic of Ragusa, in 1699, gave the town of Neum to the Ottoman Empire because it did not want to have a land border with the Republic of Venice. This small municipality was inherited by Bosnia and Herzegovina and now provides limited sea access, splitting the Croatian part of the Adriatic coast in two. Since Bosnia and Herzegovina is a new country, railways and ports have not been built for its need. There is no freight port along its short coastline at Neum, making it effectively landlocked, although there are plans to change this. Instead, the Port of Ploče in Croatia is used.
* The International Congo Society, which owned the territory now constituting the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was awarded a narrow piece of land cutting through Angola to connect it to the sea by the Conference of Berlin in 1885.
* After World War I, in the Treaty of Versailles, a part of Germany designated &quot;the Polish corridor&quot; was given to the new Second Polish Republic, for access to the Baltic Sea. This gave Poland a short coastline, but without a large harbour. This was also the pretext for making Danzig (now Gdańsk) with its harbour the Free City of Danzig, to which Poland was given free access. However, the Germans placed obstacles to this free access, especially when it came to military material. In response, the small fishing harbour of Gdynia was soon greatly enlarged.
*As a result of a 2005 territorial exchange with Ukraine, Moldova received a 600-metre (650-yard) long bank of the Danube (which is an international waterway), subsequently building its Port of Giurgiulești there.

=== Trade agreements ===
Countries can establish agreements to provide for free transport of goods through neighbouring countries:

* The Treaty of Versailles required Germany to offer Czechoslovakia a lease for 99 years of parts of the ports in Hamburg and Stettin, allowing Czechoslovakia sea trade via the Elbe and Oder rivers. Stettin was annexed by Poland after World War II, but Hamburg continued the contract so that part of the port (now called Moldauhafen) until 2028 could be used for sea trade by a successor of Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic.
* The Danube is an international waterway, and thus landlocked Austria, Hungary, Moldova, Serbia and Slovakia have secure access to the Black Sea. However, oceangoing ships cannot use the Danube, so cargo must be transloaded anyway, and many overseas imports into Austria and Hungary use land transport from Atlantic and Mediterranean ports. A similar situation exists for the Rhine river where Switzerland has boat access, but not oceangoing ships. Luxembourg has such through the Moselle, but Liechtenstein has no boat access, even though it is located along the Rhine, as the Rhine is not navigable that far upstream.
* The Mekong is an international waterway so that landlocked Laos has access to the South China Sea (since Laos became independent from French Indochina). However, it is not navigable above the Khone Phapheng Falls.
* Free ports allow transshipment to short-distance ships or river vessels.
* The TIR Convention allows sealed road transport without customs checks and charges, mostly in Europe.

=== Political repercussions ===
Losing access to the sea is generally a great loss to a nation, politically, militarily, and economically. The following are examples of countries becoming landlocked.

* The independence of Eritrea, brought about by the 30-year Eritrean War of Independence, caused Ethiopia to become landlocked in 1991 (&quot;de facto&quot;)/1993 (&quot;de jure&quot;): the Ethiopian Navy operated from foreign ports in Djibouti and Yemen before being dissolved in 1996.
* Montenegro&#x27;s decision to abandon the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro caused the federal unit of Serbia to become a landlocked current independent state.
* Bolivia lost its coastline to Chile in the War of the Pacific and accepted it in treaties signed in 1884 and 1904. The last treaty gives port storage facilities and special treatment for the transit of goods from and to Bolivia through Chilean ports and territory. Peru and Argentina have also given special treatment for the transit of goods. A fluvial Bolivian Navy, which did not exist at the time of the War of the Pacific, was created later and both trains and operates in Lake Titicaca and rivers. The Bolivian people annually celebrate a patriotic &quot;Dia del Mar&quot; (Day of the Sea) to remember its territorial loss, which included both the coastal city of Antofagasta and what has proven to be one of the most significant and lucrative copper deposits in the world. Early in the 21st century, the selection of the route of gas pipes from Bolivia to the sea fueled popular uprisings, as people were against the option of laying the pipes through Chilean territory.
* Austria and Hungary also lost their access to the sea as a consequence of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919) and the Treaty of Trianon (1920) respectively. Previously, although Croatia had a limited constitutional within the Kingdom of Hungary, the City of Fiume/Rijeka on the Croatian coast was governed directly from Budapest by an appointed governor as a &quot;corpus separatum&quot;, to provide Hungary with its only international port in the periods 1779–1813, 1822–1848 and 1868–1918. The most important ports in Austria were Trieste and Pula, now in Italy and Croatia.
* In 1801, the Nizam&#x27;s dominion of Hyderabad State assumed its current borders as a landlocked princely state with territories in central Deccan, bounded on all sides by British India. For the preceding 150 years it had had a considerable coastline on the Bay of Bengal that was annexed by the British.
* It is possible that one of the causes of the Paraguayan War was Paraguay&#x27;s lack of direct ocean access (although this is disputed; see the linked article).
* When the Entente Powers divided the former Ottoman Empire under the Treaty of Sèvres at the close of World War I, Armenia was promised part of the Trebizond vilayet (roughly corresponding to the modern Trabzon and Rize provinces in Turkey). This would have given Armenia access to the Black Sea. However, the Sèvres treaty collapsed with the Turkish War of Independence and was superseded by the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), which firmly established Turkish rule over the area.
* In 2011, South Sudan broke off from the Sudan, causing the former to become landlocked. There still remains conflict over the oil fields in South Sudan between the two countries.

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea now gives a landlocked country a right of access to and from the sea without taxation of traffic through transit states. The United Nations has a programme of action to assist landlocked developing countries, and the current responsible Undersecretary-General is Anwarul Karim Chowdhury.

Some countries have a long coastline, but much of it may not be readily usable for trade and commerce. For instance, in its early history, Russia&#x27;s only ports were on the Arctic Ocean and frozen shut for much of the year. The wish to gain control of a warm-water port was a major motivator of Russian expansion towards the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and Pacific Ocean. On the other hand, some landlocked countries can have access to the ocean along wide navigable rivers. For instance, Paraguay (and Bolivia to a lesser extent) have access to the ocean through the Paraguay and Paraná rivers.

Several countries have coastlines on landlocked bodies of water, such as the Caspian Sea and the Dead Sea. Since these seas are in effect lakes without access to wider seaborne trade, countries such as Kazakhstan are still considered landlocked. Although the Caspian Sea is connected to the Black Sea via the man-made Volga–Don Canal, large oceangoing ships are unable to traverse it.

Some countries or important parts of countries have coastlines or river ports reachable by oceangoing ships, but only through a strait or river part of the territory of another country. The other country can put restriction on passage. Between 1429 and 1857 Poland, Sweden, Russia and more Baltic countries were suffering from the Sound Dues, a toll needed to be paid to reach Western European waters. Sweden bypassed it by conquering Scania in 1658.

== By degree ==
Landlocked countries may be bordered by a single country having direct access to the high seas, two or more such countries, or be surrounded by other landlocked countries, making a country doubly landlocked.

=== Landlocked by a single country ===
Three countries are landlocked by a single country (enclaved countries):

* Lesotho, a state surrounded by South Africa.
* San Marino, a state surrounded by Italy.
* Vatican City, a city-state surrounded by Italy, specifically Rome.

=== Landlocked by two countries ===
Seven landlocked countries are surrounded by only two mutually bordering neighbours (semi-enclaved countries):

* Andorra (between France and Spain)
* Bhutan (between China and India)
* Eswatini (between Mozambique and South Africa)
* Liechtenstein (between Austria and Switzerland) – one of the only two &quot;doubly landlocked countries&quot; in the world
* Moldova (between Romania and Ukraine) – ignoring Transnistria, a de facto state
* Mongolia (between China and Russia)
* Nepal (between China and India)

To this group could be added three landlocked territories, two of them &quot;de facto&quot; states with limited or no international recognition:

* Transnistria (between Moldova and Ukraine) – de facto state
* South Ossetia (between Georgia and Russia) – de facto state
* West Bank (between Israel and Jordan) – Israeli-occupied territory partly administered by the State of Palestine

=== Doubly landlocked ===
A country is &quot;doubly landlocked&quot; or &quot;double-landlocked&quot; when it is surrounded entirely by landlocked countries (i.e. requiring the crossing of at least two national borders to reach a coastline). There are two such countries:

* Liechtenstein in Western Europe, surrounded by Austria and Switzerland.
* Uzbekistan in Central Asia, surrounded by Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.

After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of Württemberg became a doubly landlocked state, bordering Bavaria, Baden, Switzerland, the Grand Duchy of Hesse (Wimpfen exclave), Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, and Hohenzollern-Hechingen. The latter two were themselves landlocked between each other, Württemberg, and Baden. In 1866 they became an exclave of Prussia, giving Württemberg a border with a coastal country but any path to a coast would still lead across at least two borders. The Free City of Frankfurt which was independent between 1815 and 1866 was doubly landlocked as it bordered the Electorate of Hesse, the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Hesse-Homburg, and Nassau. In the German Confederation there were several other landlocked states that only bordered landlocked states and landlocked exclaves of coastal states: the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Hesse-Homburg, Nassau (all until 1866), Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Saxe-Hildburghausen (both until 1826), and Reuss, elder line (until 1871). All of these bordered Prussia but not the main territory with sea access.

There were no doubly landlocked countries from the unification of Germany in 1871 until the end of World War I. Liechtenstein bordered the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which had an Adriatic coastline, and Uzbekistan was then part of the Russian Empire, which had both ocean and sea access.

With the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918 and creation of an independent, landlocked Austria, Liechtenstein became the sole doubly landlocked country until 1938. In the Anschluss that year, Austria was absorbed into Nazi Germany, which possessed a border on the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. After World War II, Austria regained its independence and Liechtenstein once again became doubly landlocked.

Uzbekistan, which had been part of the Russian Empire and then the Soviet Union, gained its independence with the dissolution of the latter in 1991 and became the second doubly landlocked country.

However, Uzbekistan&#x27;s doubly landlocked status depends on whether the Caspian Sea is considered a lake or a sea. In the latter case, Uzbekistan is not doubly landlocked, since its neighbors Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan have access to the Caspian Sea.

== List of landlocked countries and landlocked de facto states ==
Notes:

: &quot;Has a coastline on the inland saltwater Caspian Sea&quot;
: &quot;De facto state&quot;
: &quot;Landlocked by a single country&quot;
: &quot;Doubly landlocked country&quot;

=== Groupings ===
The landlocked countries and de facto states can be grouped in &quot;contiguous&quot; groups as follows:

* Eastern, Middle, and Western African cluster (10): Burkina Faso, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda
* Eastern, Southern, and Western European cluster (9): Austria, Czechia, Hungary, Kosovo (de facto state), Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, Serbia, Slovakia, and Switzerland
* Central and Southern Asian cluster (6): Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan
* Eastern and Southern African cluster (4): Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe
* Eastern European group (2): Moldova and Transnistria (de facto state)
* South American group (2): Bolivia and Paraguay
* Western Asian group (2): Armenia and Azerbaijan

Notes:

# If it were not for the of coastline at Moanda, DR Congo would join the two African clusters into one, making it the biggest contiguous cluster in the world instead.
# The Central and Southern Asian cluster and the Western Asian group can be considered contiguous, joined by the landlocked Caspian Sea. Mongolia is almost a part of this cluster too, being separated from Kazakhstan by only , across Chinese or Russian territory.
# Before the Annexation of Sikkim by India, the Himalayan states of Bhutan, Nepal, and Sikkim formed their own Southern Asian group.

=== &quot;Single&quot; landlocked countries ===
There are the following 12 &quot;single&quot; landlocked countries (each of them borders no other landlocked country or de facto state):

* Asia (5): Bhutan, Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, and South Ossetia (de facto state)
* Europe (5): Andorra, Belarus, Luxembourg, San Marino, and Vatican City (the Holy See)
* Africa (2): Eswatini and Lesotho

== Landlocked countries by continent ==
According to the United Nations geoscheme (excluding the de facto states), Africa has the most landlocked countries, at 16, followed by Europe (14), Asia (12), and South America (2). However, if Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and South Ossetia (de facto state) are counted as parts of Europe, then Europe has the most landlocked countries, at 20 (including all three landlocked de facto states). If these transcontinental or culturally European countries are included in Asia, then both Africa and Europe (including Kosovo and Transnistria) have the most, at 16. Depending on the status of Kazakhstan and the South Caucasian countries, Asia has between 9 and 13 (including South Ossetia). South America only has two landlocked countries: Bolivia and Paraguay.

Australia and North America have no landlocked countries, while Antarctica has no countries at all. Oceania (which is usually not considered a continent but a geographical region by the English-speaking countries) also has no landlocked countries.

All landlocked countries, except Bolivia and Paraguay, are located on the continental mainland of Afro-Eurasia.

<text>Corsairs () were privateers, authorised to conduct raids on shipping of a foreign state at war with France, on behalf of the French crown. Seized vessels and cargo were sold at auction, with the corsair captain entitled to a portion of the proceeds. Although not French Navy personnel, corsairs were considered legitimate combatants in France (and allied nations), provided the commanding officer of the vessel was in possession of a valid letter of marque ( or , the latter giving &quot;corsairs&quot; their name), and the officers and crew conducted themselves according to contemporary admiralty law. By acting on behalf of the French Crown, if captured by the enemy, they could in principle claim treatment as prisoners of war, instead of being considered pirates. 

Because corsairs gained a swashbuckling reputation, the word &quot;corsair&quot; is also used generically as a more romantic or flamboyant way of referring to privateers, or even to pirates. The Barbary pirates of North Africa as well as the Ottoman Empire were sometimes called &quot;Turkish corsairs&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;corsair&quot; comes directly from the French phrase &#x27;lettre de course&#x27;, the word &#x27;corsaire&#x27; borrowed from the Italian &quot;corsaro&quot;. This derives from the Latin &quot;cursus&quot;, meaning &quot;course&quot; (as in journey or expedition). The French word &quot;corsaire&quot; may have originated as a mispronunciation of the Arabic word ; the term &quot;pirate&quot; had been in use in French since the Middle Ages. However, Sayyid Sulaimān Nadvī, an Indian Muslim scholar of Islamic studies, says that &quot;Qarsan ... [may be] the arabicised form of &#x27;Corsair&#x27;.&quot;

==History==
The corsairs were privateers working for the King of France attacking the ships of France&#x27;s enemies. In France they did not need to fear punishment for piracy—being hanged—as they were granted a licence as combatants, the &quot;lettre de marque&quot; or &quot;lettre de course&quot;, a document which legitimised their actions to the French justice system and which they hoped gave them the status of a war prisoner in case they were ever captured.

The corsair was ordered to attack only the ships of enemy countries, theoretically respecting those of neutral nations and his own nations. If he did not respect this rule, he was then treated as a pirate and hanged. The corsairs&#x27; activities also provided the King with revenue as the licence required them to hand over a part of their booty to the King.

In common with privateers of other nationalities, however, they were often considered pirates by their foreign opponents, and might be hanged as pirates if captured by the foreigners they preyed on.

The &quot;corsair&quot; activities started in the Middle Ages the main goals really being to compensate for the economic problems in war periods; and the ship owners did not accept that the war was an obstacle to their trade. Jean de Châtillon, who was a bishop, in 1144 gave the town of Saint-Malo the status of rights of asylum which encouraged all manner of thieves and rogues to move there. Their motto was &quot;Neither Breton, nor French, but from Saint-Malo am I!&quot;. Saint-Malo, however, progressed and in 1308 the town was made into a free commune to encourage the commercial activities of craftsmen as well as merchants and ship owners. This did not really work out and later in 1395 the town became a free port. This situation continued until 1688.

Between the early 1500s and 1713, when the signing of the Peace of Utrecht effectively put an end to the French corsair raids in the Caribbean, the &quot;guerre de course&quot;, as the French called it, took a huge toll on the Spanish treasure fleet&#x27;s efforts to ship the gold and silver from Peru to Santo Domingo and Havana and then on to Spain. During this period, there was an intense drive to improve, not only the speed of the ships involved in this contest, but also their manoeuvrability and ability to sail into the wind (the close haul). It was a matter of life or death, and immense wealth was at stake. Jean d&#x27;Ango, father and son, came to be among the wealthiest and most influential men in France. In addition to those listed below, Giovanni da Verrazzano (namesake of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge) and Jean Fleury were among the principals in this era. The 1517 travel journal of Antonio de Beatis described the ship of Fra Bernardino, known as the &quot;Great Corsair&quot; (operating against Turkish vessels) in Marseille: &quot;His galleon is massively timbered, new and extremely well-fitted out, especially in point of artillery, carrying as it does twelve cannon, twelve falconets and a hundred arquebuses.&quot;

The activities of the corsairs were so profitable that the Minister of the Navy used this in his strategy to make money. Moreover, the King used to take one-quarter or even one-third of the booty. The corsairs&#x27; activities weakened France&#x27;s enemies; indeed, English trade losses were very important from 1688 to 1717.

In a note based on an examination of &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; from 1793 to 1800, the anonymous author showed that British shipping losses to captures exceeded those resulting from the perils of the sea.

Losses to capture: 4314; recaptured 705; Net – 3639&lt;br&gt;
Perils of the sea: 2385 plus 652 driven on shore, of which 70 recovered; Net – 2967.

The relationship between the corsairs and the State changed as the power of the State grew. The rules became stricter and State control more and more present. At the end of the 18th century, the &quot;course&quot; started to decline until its legal death in 1856. The &quot;course&quot; disappeared in France with the Empire in 1804, but was officially ended only by the 1814 Treaty of Paris, where every major northern hemisphere nation except Spain, Mexico, and the United States, was present, and the 1815 Congress of Vienna.

==Famous corsairs==
===François Aregnaudeau===
François Aregnaudeau (1774–c.1813), was a Breton who commanded a number of privateers, most notably &quot;Blonde&quot;, and &quot;Duc de Dantzig&quot;. In them he captured numerous prizes. He and &quot;Duc de Dantzig&quot; disappeared without a trace around the end of 1812. Their disappearance gave rise to an unsubstantiated gruesome ghost ship legend.

===René Duguay-Trouin===
René Duguay-Trouin was born in Saint-Malo in 1673, and the son of a rich ship owner took a fleet of 64 ships and was honoured in 1709 for capturing more than 300 merchant ships and 20 warships. He had a brilliant privateering and naval career and eventually became &quot;Lieutenant-General of the Naval Armies of the King&quot;, &quot;i.e.,&quot; admiral, (French:Lieutenant-Général des armées navales du roi), and a Commander in the Order of Saint-Louis. He died peacefully in 1736.

===Robert Surcouf===
Robert Surcouf was the last and best-known corsair of the Saint-Malo. Born there in 1773, his father was a ship owner and his mother the daughter of a captain. Ship&#x27;s boy at 13 and corsair captain at 22 years old, and then — very much against his licence — for several years attacked ships including those of the French East India Company, or &quot;Compagnie Française des Indes&quot;. During the French Revolution, the &quot;convention&quot; government disapproved of &quot;lettres de course&quot;, so Surcouf operated at great personal risk as a pirate against British shipping to India. Surcouf was so successful that he became a popular celebrity in France. After a brief early retirement Surcouf again operated against shipping to the Indies. Surcouf became a ship owner himself and died in Saint-Malo in 1827. There is a statue of him on public display there, and his house is now a small museum.

===Jean Bart===
Jean Bart (21 October 1650 – 27 April 1702) was a French naval commander and privateer. He achieved his greatest successes during the Nine Years&#x27; War (1688–1697).
