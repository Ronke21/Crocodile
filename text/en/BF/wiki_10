<text>William Paterson (December 24, 1745 – September 9, 1806) was an American statesman, lawyer, jurist, and signer of the United States Constitution. He was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, the second governor of New Jersey, and a Founding Father of the United States.

Born in County Antrim, Ireland, Paterson moved to the North American British colonies at a young age. After graduating from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and studying law under Richard Stockton, he was admitted to the bar in 1768. He helped write the 1776 Constitution of New Jersey and served as the New Jersey Attorney General from 1776 to 1783. He represented New Jersey at the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, where he proposed the New Jersey Plan, which would have provided for equal representation among the states in Congress.

After the ratification of the Constitution, Paterson served in the United States Senate from 1789 to 1790, helping to draft the Judiciary Act of 1789. He resigned from the Senate to take office as governor of New Jersey. In 1793, he accepted appointment by President George Washington to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. He served on the court until his death in 1806.

==Early life==
William Paterson was born December 24, 1745, in County Antrim, Ireland, to Richard Paterson, an Ulster Protestant. Paterson immigrated with his parents to New Castle, Pennsylvania, in 1747. At 14, he began college at Princeton. After graduating, he read law with the prominent lawyer Richard Stockton and was admitted to the bar in 1768. He also stayed connected to his alma mater and helped found the Cliosophic Society with Aaron Burr.

==Career==

===Early career===
Paterson was selected as the Somerset County delegate for the first three provincial congresses of New Jersey, where, as secretary, he recorded the 1776 New Jersey State Constitution. Paterson was appointed as the first attorney general of New Jersey, serving from 1776 to 1783, establishing himself as one of the state&#x27;s most prominent lawyers. He was sent to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, where he proposed the New Jersey Plan for a unicameral legislative body with equal representation from each state. The Constitution of the United States was ultimately signed with the Connecticut Compromise that created a bicameral Congress with a Senate that equally represented each state and a House of Representatives with population-based representation.

=== Military Service ===
In 1775, Paterson was commissioned into the Somerset County Minutemen of the New Jersey militia and served on the Council of Safety, the body that developed and managed New Jersey&#x27;s military forces for the American Revolutionary War.

=== United States Senator ===
Paterson, who was a strong nationalist who supported the Federalist Party, went on to become one of New Jersey&#x27;s first U.S. senators (1789–90). As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he played an important role in drafting the Judiciary Act of 1789 that established the federal court system. The first nine sections of this very important law are in his handwriting.

===Governor of New Jersey===
In 1790, he became the first person to resign from the U.S. Senate, when he did so in order to succeed fellow signer William Livingston as governor of New Jersey. As governor, Paterson pursued his interest in legal matters by codifying the English statutes that had been in force in New Jersey before the Revolution in &quot;Laws of the State of New Jersey&quot;. He also published a revision of the rules of the chancery and common law courts in Paterson, later adopted by the New Jersey Legislature.

===United States Supreme Court===
President George Washington nominated Paterson for the Supreme Court of the United States on February 27, 1793, to the seat vacated by Thomas Johnson. Washington withdrew the nomination the following day, having realized that since the Judiciary Act of 1789 (the law creating the Supreme Court) had been passed during Paterson&#x27;s current term as a Senator, the nomination was a violation of the Ineligibility Clause (Article I, Section 6) of the Constitution. Washington re-nominated Paterson to the court on March 4, 1793, after his term as Senator had expired; Paterson was immediately confirmed by the Senate and received his commission.

He resigned from the governorship to become an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. On the circuit, he presided over the trials of individuals indicted for treason in the Whiskey Rebellion, a revolt by farmers in western Pennsylvania over the federal excise tax on whiskey, the principal product of their cash crop. Militia sent out by President Washington successfully quelled the uprising, and for the first time, the courts had to interpret the provisions of the Constitution concerning the use of troops in civil disturbances. Here, and, throughout his long career, Paterson extolled the primacy of law over governments, a principle embodied in the Constitution he helped write. He declined an appointment as Secretary of State in 1795. Paterson was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1789. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1801. Paterson served on the Supreme Court until he died in 1806.

==Personal life==

In 1779, Paterson married Cornelia Bell (1755–1783), daughter of John Bell, a wealthy Somerset County landowner. Together, they had three children, but she died in 1783 shortly after giving birth to their only son. Their children were:

* Cornelia Bell Paterson (1780–1844), who married Stephen Van Rensselaer (1764–1839) after the death of his first wife, Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Schuyler (1758–1801)
* Frances Van Paterson (1781–1783), who died young
* William Bell Paterson (1783–1832), who married Jane Eliza Neilson

In 1785, he married Euphemia White (1746–1832), sister of Anthony Walton White (1750–1803), daughter of Anthony White (1717–1787), a New Jersey landholder and judge of the Somerset court, and the granddaughter of Lewis Morris (1671–1746), chief justice of New York from 1715 to 1733 and governor of New Jersey from 1738 to 1746.

===Death and interment===
On September 9, 1806, Paterson, aged 60, died from the lingering effects of a coach accident suffered in 1803 while on circuit court duty in New Jersey. He was on his way to the spa at Ballston Springs, New York, to &quot;take the waters&quot;, when he died at the Van Rensselaer Manor home of his daughter, Cornelia, and son-in-law, Stephen Van Rensselaer, in Albany, New York. He was laid to rest in the Van Renssalaer family vault. When the city acquired the property, Paterson&#x27;s remains were relocated to Albany Rural Cemetery Menands in Albany County, New York. Also buried there are Associate Justice Rufus W. Peckham and President Chester A. Arthur.

===Descendants===
Through his eldest daughter, his grandchildren include Cortlandt Van Rensselaer (1808–1860), a noted Presbyterian clergyman, and Henry Bell Van Rensselaer (1810–1864), a politician and general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, who married Elizabeth Ray King, a granddaughter of U.S. Senator Rufus King.

Through his son, his grandchildren included twin brothers, William Paterson (1817–1899), who married Salvadora Meade, a Spanish-born woman living in Philadelphia, and Stephen Van Rensselaer Paterson (1817–1872), who married Emily Sophia King (1823–1853), daughter of Charles King (1789–1867), the president of Columbia University, and the second son Rufus King. Both grandsons were members of the Princeton University class of 1835 and William was admitted to the bar in 1838. He later served as a member of the New Jersey Assembly from 1842 to 1843, Secretary of the New Jersey Constitutional Convention of 1844, a lay judge of the Court of Errors and Appeals, and mayor of Perth Amboy for ten years in between 1846 and 1878.

===Honors===
Both the city of Paterson, and the college, William Paterson University, are named after him.

<text>In mathematics, in particular in algebraic topology, differential geometry and algebraic geometry, the Chern classes are characteristic classes associated with complex vector bundles. They have since become fundamental concepts in many branches of mathematics and physics, such as string theory, Chern–Simons theory, knot theory, and Gromov–Witten invariants.
Chern classes were introduced by .

== Geometric approach ==

=== Basic idea and motivation ===

Chern classes are characteristic classes. They are topological invariants associated with vector bundles on a smooth manifold. The question of whether two ostensibly different vector bundles are the same can be quite hard to answer. The Chern classes provide a simple test: if the Chern classes of a pair of vector bundles do not agree, then the vector bundles are different. The converse, however, is not true.

In topology, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry, it is often important to count how many linearly independent sections a vector bundle has. The Chern classes offer some information about this through, for instance, the Riemann–Roch theorem and the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.

Chern classes are also feasible to calculate in practice. In differential geometry (and some types of algebraic geometry), the Chern classes can be expressed as polynomials in the coefficients of the curvature form.

=== Construction ===

There are various ways of approaching the subject, each of which focuses on a slightly different flavor of Chern class.

The original approach to Chern classes was via algebraic topology: the Chern classes arise via homotopy theory which provides a mapping associated with a vector bundle to a classifying space (an infinite Grassmannian in this case). For any complex vector bundle &quot;V&quot; over a manifold &quot;M&quot;, there exists a map &quot;f&quot; from &quot;M&quot; to the classifying space such that the bundle &quot;V&quot; is equal to the pullback, by &quot;f&quot;, of a universal bundle over the classifying space, and the Chern classes of &quot;V&quot; can therefore be defined as the pullback of the Chern classes of the universal bundle. In turn, these universal Chern classes can be explicitly written down in terms of Schubert cycles.

It can be shown that for any two maps &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; from &quot;M&quot; to the classifying space whose pullbacks are the same bundle &quot;V&quot;, the maps must be homotopic. Therefore, the pullback by either &quot;f&quot; or &quot;g&quot; of any universal Chern class to a cohomology class of &quot;M&quot; must be the same class. This shows that the Chern classes of &quot;V&quot; are well-defined.

Chern&#x27;s approach used differential geometry, via the curvature approach described predominantly in this article. He showed that the earlier definition was in fact equivalent to his. The resulting theory is known as the Chern–Weil theory.

There is also an approach of Alexander Grothendieck showing that axiomatically one need only define the line bundle case.

Chern classes arise naturally in algebraic geometry. The generalized Chern classes in algebraic geometry can be defined for vector bundles (or more precisely, locally free sheaves) over any nonsingular variety. Algebro-geometric Chern classes do not require the underlying field to have any special properties. In particular, the vector bundles need not necessarily be complex.

Regardless of the particular paradigm, the intuitive meaning of the Chern class concerns &#x27;required zeroes&#x27; of a section of a vector bundle: for example the theorem saying one can&#x27;t comb a hairy ball flat (hairy ball theorem). Although that is strictly speaking a question about a &quot;real&quot; vector bundle (the &quot;hairs&quot; on a ball are actually copies of the real line), there are generalizations in which the hairs are complex (see the example of the complex hairy ball theorem below), or for 1-dimensional projective spaces over many other fields.

See Chern–Simons theory for more discussion.

== The Chern class of line bundles ==

(Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space having the homotopy type of a CW complex.)

An important special case occurs when &quot;V&quot; is a line bundle. Then the only nontrivial Chern class is the first Chern class, which is an element of the second cohomology group of &quot;X&quot;. As it is the top Chern class, it equals the Euler class of the bundle.

The first Chern class turns out to be a complete invariant with which to classify complex line bundles, topologically speaking. That is, there is a bijection between the isomorphism classes of line bundles over &quot;X&quot; and the elements of formula_1, which associates to a line bundle its first Chern class. Moreover, this bijection is a group homomorphism (thus an isomorphism):
formula_2
the tensor product of complex line bundles corresponds to the addition in the second cohomology group.

In algebraic geometry, this classification of (isomorphism classes of) complex line bundles by the first Chern class is a crude approximation to the classification of (isomorphism classes of) holomorphic line bundles by linear equivalence classes of divisors.

For complex vector bundles of dimension greater than one, the Chern classes are not a complete invariant.

== Constructions ==

=== Via the Chern–Weil theory ===
Given a complex hermitian vector bundle &quot;V&quot; of complex rank &quot;n&quot; over a smooth manifold &quot;M&quot;, representatives of each Chern class (also called a Chern form) formula_3 of &quot;V&quot; are given as the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the curvature form formula_4 of &quot;V&quot;.

formula_5

The determinant is over the ring of formula_6 matrices whose entries are polynomials in &quot;t&quot; with coefficients in the commutative algebra of even complex differential forms on &quot;M&quot;. The curvature form formula_4 of &quot;V&quot; is defined as
formula_8
with ω the connection form and &quot;d&quot; the exterior derivative, or via the same expression in which ω is a gauge field for the gauge group of &quot;V&quot;. The scalar &quot;t&quot; is used here only as an indeterminate to generate the sum from the determinant, and &quot;I&quot; denotes the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; identity matrix.

To say that the expression given is a &quot;representative&quot; of the Chern class indicates that &#x27;class&#x27; here means up to addition of an exact differential form. That is, Chern classes are cohomology classes in the sense of de Rham cohomology. It can be shown that the cohomology classes of the Chern forms do not depend on the choice of connection in &quot;V&quot;.

If follows from the matrix identity formula_9 that formula_10. Now applying the Maclaurin series for formula_11, we get the following expression for the Chern forms:

formula_12

=== Via an Euler class ===
One can define a Chern class in terms of an Euler class. This is the approach in the book by Milnor and Stasheff, and emphasizes the role of an orientation of a vector bundle.

The basic observation is that a complex vector bundle comes with a canonical orientation, ultimately because formula_13 is connected. Hence, one simply defines the top Chern class of the bundle to be its Euler class (the Euler class of the underlying real vector bundle) and handles lower Chern classes in an inductive fashion.

The precise construction is as follows. The idea is to do base change to get a bundle of one-less rank. Let formula_14 be a complex vector bundle over a paracompact space &quot;B&quot;. Thinking of &quot;B&quot; as being embedded in &quot;E&quot; as the zero section, let formula_15 and define the new vector bundle:
formula_16
such that each fiber is the quotient of a fiber &quot;F&quot; of &quot;E&quot; by the line spanned by a nonzero vector &quot;v&quot; in &quot;F&quot; (a point of &quot;B′&quot; is specified by a fiber &quot;F&quot; of &quot;E&quot; and a nonzero vector on &quot;F&quot;.) Then formula_17 has rank one less than that of &quot;E&quot;. From the Gysin sequence for the fiber bundle formula_18:
formula_19
we see that formula_20 is an isomorphism for formula_21. Let
formula_22

It then takes some work to check the axioms of Chern classes are satisfied for this definition.

See also: The Thom isomorphism.

==Examples==

===The complex tangent bundle of the Riemann sphere===

Let formula_23 be the Riemann sphere: 1-dimensional complex projective space. Suppose that &quot;z&quot; is a holomorphic local coordinate for the Riemann sphere. Let formula_24 be the bundle of complex tangent vectors having the form formula_25 at each point, where &quot;a&quot; is a complex number. We prove the complex version of the &quot;hairy ball theorem&quot;: &quot;V&quot; has no section which is everywhere nonzero.

For this, we need the following fact: the first Chern class of a trivial bundle is zero, i.e.,
formula_26

This is evinced by the fact that a trivial bundle always admits a flat connection. So, we shall show that
formula_27

Consider the Kähler metric
formula_28

One readily shows that the curvature 2-form is given by
formula_29

Furthermore, by the definition of the first Chern class
formula_30

We must show that this cohomology class is non-zero. It suffices to compute its integral over the Riemann sphere:
formula_31
after switching to polar coordinates. By Stokes&#x27; theorem, an exact form would integrate to 0, so the cohomology class is nonzero.

This proves that formula_32 is not a trivial vector bundle.

=== Complex projective space ===
There is an exact sequence of sheaves/bundles:
formula_33
where formula_34 is the structure sheaf (i.e., the trivial line bundle), formula_35 is Serre&#x27;s twisting sheaf (i.e., the hyperplane bundle) and the last nonzero term is the tangent sheaf/bundle.

There are two ways to get the above sequence:

By the additivity of total Chern class formula_36 (i.e., the Whitney sum formula),
formula_37
where &quot;a&quot; is the canonical generator of the cohomology group formula_38; i.e., the negative of the first Chern class of the tautological line bundle formula_39 (note: formula_40 when formula_41 is the dual of &quot;E&quot;.)

In particular, for any formula_42,
formula_43

== Chern polynomial ==
A Chern polynomial is a convenient way to handle Chern classes and related notions systematically. By definition, for a complex vector bundle &quot;E&quot;, the Chern polynomial &quot;c&quot;&quot;t&quot; of &quot;E&quot; is given by:
formula_44

This is not a new invariant: the formal variable &quot;t&quot; simply keeps track of the degree of &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;E&quot;). In particular, formula_45 is completely determined by the total Chern class of &quot;E&quot;: formula_46 and conversely.

The Whitney sum formula, one of the axioms of Chern classes (see below), says that &quot;c&quot;&quot;t&quot; is additive in the sense:
formula_47
Now, if formula_48 is a direct sum of (complex) line bundles, then it follows from the sum formula that:
formula_49
where formula_50 are the first Chern classes. The roots formula_51, called the Chern roots of &quot;E&quot;, determine the coefficients of the polynomial: i.e.,
formula_52
where σ&quot;k&quot; are elementary symmetric polynomials. In other words, thinking of &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; as formal variables, &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot; &quot;are&quot; σ&quot;k&quot;. A basic fact on symmetric polynomials is that any symmetric polynomial in, say, &quot;t&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s is a polynomial in elementary symmetric polynomials in &quot;t&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s. Either by splitting principle or by ring theory, any Chern polynomial formula_45 factorizes into linear factors after enlarging the cohomology ring; &quot;E&quot; need not be a direct sum of line bundles in the preceding discussion. The conclusion is
Example: We have polynomials &quot;s&quot;&quot;k&quot;
formula_54
with formula_55 and so on (cf. Newton&#x27;s identities). The sum
formula_56
is called the Chern character of &quot;E&quot;, whose first few terms are: (we drop &quot;E&quot; from writing.)
formula_57

Example: The Todd class of &quot;E&quot; is given by:
formula_58

Remark: The observation that a Chern class is essentially an elementary symmetric polynomial can be used to &quot;define&quot; Chern classes. Let &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot; be the infinite Grassmannian of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional complex vector spaces. This space is equipped with a tautologous vector bundle of rank formula_59, say formula_60. formula_61 is called the classifying space for rank-formula_59 vector bundles because given any complex vector bundle &quot;E&quot; of rank &quot;n&quot; over &quot;X&quot;, there is a continuous map 
formula_63
such that the pullback of formula_64 to formula_65 along formula_66 is isomorphic to formula_67, and this map formula_66 is unique up to homotopy. Borel&#x27;s theorem says the cohomology ring of &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot; is exactly the ring of symmetric polynomials, which are polynomials in elementary symmetric polynomials σ&quot;k&quot;; so, the pullback of &quot;f&quot;&quot;E&quot; reads:
formula_69
One then puts:
formula_70

Remark: Any characteristic class is a polynomial in Chern classes, for the reason as follows. Let formula_71 be the contravariant functor that, to a CW complex &quot;X&quot;, assigns the set of isomorphism classes of complex vector bundles of rank &quot;n&quot; over &quot;X&quot; and, to a map, its pullback. By definition, a characteristic class is a natural transformation from formula_72 to the cohomology functor formula_73 Characteristic classes form a ring because of the ring structure of cohomology ring. Yoneda&#x27;s lemma says this ring of characteristic classes is exactly the cohomology ring of &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot;:
formula_74

=== Applications of formulae ===
We can use these abstract properties to compute the rest of the chern classes of line bundles on formula_23. Recall that formula_92 showing formula_93. Then using tensor powers, we can relate them to the chern classes of formula_94 for any integer.

== Properties ==

Given a complex vector bundle &quot;E&quot; over a topological space &quot;X&quot;, the Chern classes of &quot;E&quot; are a sequence of elements of the cohomology of &quot;X&quot;. The &quot;k&quot;-th Chern class of &quot;E&quot;, which is usually denoted &quot;ck&quot;(&quot;E&quot;), is an element of
formula_95
the cohomology of &quot;X&quot; with integer coefficients. One can also define the total Chern class
formula_96

Since the values are in integral cohomology groups, rather than cohomology with real coefficients, these Chern classes are slightly more refined than those in the Riemannian example.

===Classical axiomatic definition===
The Chern classes satisfy the following four axioms:
# formula_97 for all &quot;E&quot;.
# Naturality: If formula_98 is continuous and &quot;f*E&quot; is the vector bundle pullback of &quot;E&quot;, then formula_99.
# Whitney sum formula: If formula_100 is another complex vector bundle, then the Chern classes of the direct sum formula_101 are given by formula_102 that is, formula_103
# Normalization: The total Chern class of the tautological line bundle over formula_104 is 1−&quot;H&quot;, where &quot;H&quot; is Poincaré dual to the hyperplane formula_105.

===Grothendieck axiomatic approach===

Alternatively, replaced these with a slightly smaller set of axioms:

* Naturality: (Same as above)
* Additivity: If formula_106 is an exact sequence of vector bundles, then formula_107.
* Normalization: If &quot;E&quot; is a line bundle, then formula_108 where formula_109 is the Euler class of the underlying real vector bundle.

He shows using the Leray–Hirsch theorem that the total Chern class of an arbitrary finite rank complex vector bundle can be defined in terms of the first Chern class of a tautologically-defined line bundle.

Namely, introducing the projectivization formula_110 of the rank &quot;n&quot; complex vector bundle &quot;E&quot; → &quot;B&quot; as the fiber bundle on &quot;B&quot; whose fiber at any point formula_111 is the projective space of the fiber &quot;Eb&quot;. The total space of this bundle formula_110 is equipped with its tautological complex line bundle, that we denote formula_113, and the first Chern class
formula_114
restricts on each fiber formula_115 to minus the (Poincaré-dual) class of the hyperplane, that spans the cohomology of the fiber, in view of the cohomology of complex projective spaces.

The classes
formula_116
therefore form a family of ambient cohomology classes restricting to a basis of the cohomology of the fiber. The Leray–Hirsch theorem then states that any class in formula_117 can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the 1, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 with classes on the base as coefficients.

In particular, one may define the Chern classes of &quot;E&quot; in the sense of Grothendieck, denoted formula_118 by expanding this way the class formula_119, with the relation:
formula_120

One then may check that this alternative definition coincides with whatever other definition one may favor, or use the previous axiomatic characterization.

===The top Chern class===
In fact, these properties uniquely characterize the Chern classes. They imply, among other things:

* If &quot;n&quot; is the complex rank of &quot;V&quot;, then formula_121 for all &quot;k&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;. Thus the total Chern class terminates.
* The top Chern class of &quot;V&quot; (meaning formula_122, where &quot;n&quot; is the rank of &quot;V&quot;) is always equal to the Euler class of the underlying real vector bundle.

== In algebraic geometry ==
=== Axiomatic description ===
There is another construction of Chern classes which take values in the algebrogeometric analogue of the cohomology ring, the Chow ring.

Let formula_65 be a nonsingular quasi-projective variety of dimension formula_59. It can be shown that there is a unique theory of Chern classes which assigns an algebraic vector bundle formula_125 to elements formula_126 called Chern classes, with Chern polynomial formula_127, satisfying the following (similar to Grothendieck&#x27;s axiomatic approach). 
# If for a Cartier divisor formula_128, we have formula_129, then formula_130.
# If formula_131 is a morphism, then formula_132.
# If formula_133 is an exact sequence of vector bundles on formula_65, the Whitney sum formula holds: formula_135.

=== Normal sequence ===
Computing the characteristic classes for projective space forms the basis for many characteristic class computations since for any smooth projective subvariety formula_136 there is the short exact sequence
formula_137

==== Quintic threefold ====
For example, consider a nonsingular quintic threefold in formula_138. Its normal bundle is given by formula_139 and we have the short exact sequence
formula_140

Let formula_141 denote the hyperplane class in formula_142. Then the Whitney sum formula gives us that
formula_143

Since the Chow ring of a hypersurface is difficult to compute, we will consider this sequence as a sequence of coherent sheaves in formula_138. This gives us that
formula_145

Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem we can integrate the class formula_146 to compute the Euler characteristic. Traditionally this is called the Euler class. This is
formula_147
since the class of formula_148 can be represented by five points (by Bézout&#x27;s theorem). The Euler characteristic can then be used to compute the Betti numbers for the cohomology of formula_65 by using the definition of the Euler characteristic and using the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.
==== Degree d hypersurfaces ====
If formula_150 is a degree formula_151 smooth hypersurface, we have the short exact sequence formula_152 giving the relation formula_153 we can then calculate this as
formula_154
Giving the total chern class. In particular, we can find formula_65 is a spin 4-manifold if formula_156 is even, so every smooth hypersurface of degree formula_157 is a spin manifold.

==Proximate notions==

===The Chern character===
Chern classes can be used to construct a homomorphism of rings from the topological K-theory of a space to (the completion of) its rational cohomology. For a line bundle &quot;L&quot;, the Chern character ch is defined by

formula_158

More generally, if formula_159 is a direct sum of line bundles, with first Chern classes formula_160 the Chern character is defined additively
formula_161

This can be rewritten as:

formula_162

This last expression, justified by invoking the splitting principle, is taken as the definition &quot;ch(V)&quot; for arbitrary vector bundles &quot;V&quot;.

If a connection is used to define the Chern classes when the base is a manifold (i.e., the Chern–Weil theory), then the explicit form of the Chern character is
formula_163
where is the curvature of the connection.

The Chern character is useful in part because it facilitates the computation of the Chern class of a tensor product. Specifically, it obeys the following identities:

formula_164
formula_165

As stated above, using the Grothendieck additivity axiom for Chern classes, the first of these identities can be generalized to state that &quot;ch&quot; is a homomorphism of abelian groups from the K-theory &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) into the rational cohomology of &quot;X&quot;. The second identity establishes the fact that this homomorphism also respects products in &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), and so &quot;ch&quot; is a homomorphism of rings.

The Chern character is used in the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem.

===Chern numbers===

If we work on an oriented manifold of dimension formula_166, then any product of Chern classes of total degree formula_166 (i.e., the sum of indices of the Chern classes in the product should be formula_59) can be paired with the orientation homology class (or &quot;integrated over the manifold&quot;) to give an integer, a Chern number of the vector bundle. For example, if the manifold has dimension 6, there are three linearly independent Chern numbers, given by formula_169, formula_170, and formula_171. In general, if the manifold has dimension formula_166, the number of possible independent Chern numbers is the number of partitions of formula_59.

The Chern numbers of the tangent bundle of a complex (or almost complex) manifold are called the Chern numbers of the manifold, and are important invariants.

===Generalized cohomology theories===

There is a generalization of the theory of Chern classes, where ordinary cohomology is replaced with a generalized cohomology theory. The theories for which such generalization is possible are called &quot;complex orientable&quot;. The formal properties of the Chern classes remain the same, with one crucial difference: the rule which computes the first Chern class of a tensor product of line bundles in terms of first Chern classes of the factors is not (ordinary) addition, but rather a formal group law.

===Algebraic geometry===

In algebraic geometry there is a similar theory of Chern classes of vector bundles. There are several variations depending on what groups the Chern classes lie in:

*For complex varieties the Chern classes can take values in ordinary cohomology, as above.
*For varieties over general fields, the Chern classes can take values in cohomology theories such as etale cohomology or l-adic cohomology.
*For varieties &quot;V&quot; over general fields the Chern classes can also take values in homomorphisms of Chow groups CH(V): for example, the first Chern class of a line bundle over a variety &quot;V&quot; is a homomorphism from CH(&quot;V&quot;) to CH(&quot;V&quot;) reducing degrees by 1. This corresponds to the fact that the Chow groups are a sort of analog of homology groups, and elements of cohomology groups can be thought of as homomorphisms of homology groups using the cap product.

=== Manifolds with structure ===

The theory of Chern classes gives rise to cobordism invariants for almost complex manifolds.

If &quot;M&quot; is an almost complex manifold, then its tangent bundle is a complex vector bundle. The Chern classes of &quot;M&quot; are thus defined to be the Chern classes of its tangent bundle. If &quot;M&quot; is also compact and of dimension 2&quot;d&quot;, then each monomial of total degree 2&quot;d&quot; in the Chern classes can be paired with the fundamental class of &quot;M&quot;, giving an integer, a Chern number of &quot;M&quot;. If &quot;M&quot;′ is another almost complex manifold of the same dimension, then it is cobordant to &quot;M&quot; if and only if the Chern numbers of &quot;M&quot;′ coincide with those of &quot;M&quot;.

The theory also extends to real symplectic vector bundles, by the intermediation of compatible almost complex structures. In particular, symplectic manifolds have a well-defined Chern class.

<text>The 1949 Governor General&#x27;s Awards for Literary Merit were the 14th rendition of the Governor General&#x27;s Awards, Canada&#x27;s annual national awards program which then comprised literary awards alone. The awards recognized Canadian writers for new English-language works published in Canada during 1949 and were presented early in 1950. There were no cash prizes.

The Governor General&#x27;s Award for juvenile literature was introduced, and would be conferred annually through the 1958 cycle, after which there were several changes for the 1959 Governor General&#x27;s Awards under the new administrator Canada Council. As every year from 1949 to 1958, there were two awards for non-fiction, and five awards in four categories that recognized English-language works only.

<doc id="294356" wikidata="Q251918" url="?curid=294356" title="State Anthem of the Soviet Union">
<text>The State Anthem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was the national anthem of the Soviet Union and the regional anthem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1944 to 1991, replacing &quot;The Internationale&quot;. Its original lyrics were written by Sergey Mikhalkov (1913–2009) in collaboration with El-Registan (1899–1945), and its music was composed by Alexander Alexandrov (1883–1946). For a two-decade interval following de-Stalinization, the anthem was performed without lyrics. The second set of lyrics, also written by Mikhalkov and in which Stalin&#x27;s name was omitted, was adopted in 1977.

A decade after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the same melody was used for the Soviet Union&#x27;s successor state, as the State Anthem of the Russian Federation.

==History==
=== Origins ===
The anthem&#x27;s music was originally composed by Alexander Alexandrov in 1938 for the Hymn of the Bolshevik Party. Its opening bars were borrowed from one of Alexandrov&#x27;s previous pieces, &quot;Life Has Become Better&quot;, which was based on a quote by former Soviet Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin at the First All-Union Meeting of the Stakhanovites on 17 November 1935.

Other than &quot;Life Has Become Better&quot;, the music of the anthem has several possible outside influences. Alexandrov himself has described it as the combination of a march with Russian traditional music, particularly that of &quot;bylina&quot; epic songs. The anthem shares several chord progressions with Vasily Kalinnikov&#x27;s overture &quot;Bylina, Epic Poem&quot; (which, as its name indicates, is also inspired by the &quot;bylina&quot; tradition). There also exist similarities between Alexandrov&#x27;s anthem and Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Frühlingsfahrt&quot;.

When the Communist International (Comintern) was dissolved in 1943 for the Soviet Union to maintain its alliance with the other Allies of World War II, a new composition was needed to replace &quot;The Internationale&quot; as the national anthem. A contest was held in mid to late 1943 for a new anthem, and more than 200 entries were submitted. Alexandrov&#x27;s music was personally chosen by Stalin, who both praised and criticized it. The anthem&#x27;s lyrics then had to be written. Stalin thought the song should be short, and that it should invoke the Red Army&#x27;s impending victory over the forces of Germany on the Eastern Front. The poets Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriyel&#x27; Arkadyevich Ureklyan were chosen by Stalin&#x27;s staffers, called to Moscow, and given the task of writing lyrics that referenced not only the Great Patriotic War, but also &quot;a Country of Soviets&quot;. The first draft was completed overnight.

The anthem was first published on 7 November 1943. It was played for the first time on Soviet radio at midnight on 1 January 1944, and officially adopted on 15 March the same year. The new lyrics had three refrains following three different stanzas. In each refrain, the second line was modified to refer to friendship, then happiness, then glory. Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union&#x27;s war against Germany were originally invoked in the second and third verses, respectively. Reportedly, Stalin was opposed to including his name in the lyrics but relented after some Politburo members insisted.

=== Post-Stalin era ===
With the process of de-Stalinization after Stalin&#x27;s death, the lyrics referring to him were considered unacceptable, and from 1956 to 1977 the anthem was performed without lyrics. A notable exception took place at the 1976 Canada Cup ice hockey tournament, where singer Roger Doucet insisted on performing the anthem with lyrics after consultations with Russian studies scholars from Université de Montréal and Soviet team officials. In 1977, to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the October Revolution, revised lyrics, written in 1970 by original author Sergey Mikhalkov, were adopted. The varying refrains were replaced by a uniform refrain after all stanzas, and the line praising Stalin was dropped, as were the lines referring to the Great Patriotic War. Another notable change was the replacement of a line referring to the Soviet national flag with one citing the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the form of &quot;&quot;Partiya Lenina&quot; (&quot;The party of Lenin&quot;). These lyrics were also present in the original party anthem at the same place in the melody, but followed by the lyrics &quot;Partiya Stalina&quot;&quot; (&quot;The party of Stalin&quot;).

== Post-1991 use ==
===Use in the Russian Federation===
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian Federation adopted a new anthem, the &quot;Patriotic Song&quot;. It was previously the regional anthem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1990 until 1991 (until 1990 it used the State Anthem of the Soviet Union). Unlike most national anthems, it had no official lyrics (although unofficial ones written for it were proposed, they were not adopted).

The Patriotic Song was replaced soon after Vladimir Putin first took office on 7 May 2000. The federal legislature established and approved the music of the National Anthem of the Soviet Union, with newly written lyrics, in December 2000. Boris Yeltsin criticized Putin for supporting the semi-reintroduction of the Soviet-era national anthem, although some opinion polls showed that many Russians favored this decision. In late 2000, the current national anthem of Russia was introduced, which uses the music of the Soviet national anthem with new lyrics by Sergey Mikhalkov, who also wrote both the original Soviet anthem and its remake in 1977.

===State Union of Russia and Belarus===
The same music was used for a proposed anthem for the State Union of Russia and Belarus, entitled &quot;Derzhavny Soyuz Narodov&quot; (&quot;Sovereign Union of Nations&quot;). Its lyrics were not tied to any specific nationality, and there were official versions in the languages of every Soviet republic and several other Soviet languages; thus it could have been adopted by a broader union. However, it was never officially adopted, and there appear to be no plans to utilize it in any official role.

=== Decommunization ===
In some post-Soviet states which adopted decommunization laws banning Communist symbolism, publicly performing the Soviet anthem is illegal. For example, since 2015, offenders in Ukraine face up to five years in prison with the exception of Russian-occupied areas in Ukraine. Similar laws were adopted in Latvia and Lithuania.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===
After Russia annexed Crimea, Ukrainian artist responded with the song &quot;Die, Empire!&quot; (), which is modified from the Soviet national anthem.

== Official translations ==
The anthem has been officially translated into several languages:

<text>In mathematics, anticommutativity is a specific property of some non-commutative mathematical operations. Swapping the position of two arguments of an antisymmetric operation yields a result which is the &quot;inverse&quot; of the result with unswapped arguments. The notion &quot;inverse&quot; refers to a group structure on the operation&#x27;s codomain, possibly with another operation. Subtraction is an anticommutative operation because commuting the operands of gives for example, Another prominent example of an anticommutative operation is the Lie bracket.

In mathematical physics, where symmetry is of central importance, or even just in multilinear algebra these operations are mostly (multilinear with respect to some vector structures and then) called antisymmetric operations, and when they are not already of arity greater than two, extended in an associative setting to cover more than two arguments.

== Definition ==
If formula_1 are two abelian groups, a bilinear map formula_2 is anticommutative if for all formula_3 we have

:formula_4

More generally, a multilinear map formula_5 is anticommutative if for all formula_6 we have
:formula_7

where formula_8 is the sign of the permutation formula_9.

== Properties ==
If the abelian group formula_10 has no 2-torsion, implying that if formula_11 then formula_12, then any anticommutative bilinear map formula_2 satisfies

:formula_14

More generally, by transposing two elements, any anticommutative multilinear map formula_15 satisfies

:formula_16

if any of the formula_17 are equal; such a map is said to be alternating. Conversely, using multilinearity, any alternating map is anticommutative. In the binary case this works as follows: if formula_2 is alternating then by bilinearity we have

:formula_19

and the proof in the multilinear case is the same but in only two of the inputs.

== Examples ==

Examples of anticommutative binary operations include:

* Cross product
* Lie bracket of a Lie algebra
* Lie bracket of a Lie ring
* Subtraction

<doc id="294370" wikidata="Q1151539" url="?curid=294370" title="Jacobi identity">
<text>In mathematics, the Jacobi identity is a property of a binary operation that describes how the order of evaluation, the placement of parentheses in a multiple product, affects the result of the operation. By contrast, for operations with the associative property, any order of evaluation gives the same result (parentheses in a multiple product are not needed). The identity is named after the German mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. He derived the Jacobi identity for Poisson brackets in his 1862 paper on differential equations.

The cross product formula_1 and the Lie bracket operation formula_2 both satisfy the Jacobi identity. In analytical mechanics, the Jacobi identity is satisfied by the Poisson brackets. In quantum mechanics, it is satisfied by operator commutators on a Hilbert space and equivalently in the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics by the Moyal bracket.

== Definition ==
Let formula_3 and formula_4 be two binary operations, and let formula_5 be the neutral element for formula_3. The is

:formula_7

Notice the pattern in the variables on the left side of this identity. In each subsequent expression of the form formula_8, the variables formula_9, formula_10 and formula_11 are permuted according to the cycle formula_12. Alternatively, we may observe that the ordered triples formula_13, formula_14 and formula_15, are the even permutations of the ordered triple formula_13.

==Commutator bracket form==
The simplest informative example of a Lie algebra is constructed from the (associative) ring of formula_17 matrices, which may be thought of as infinitesimal motions of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space. The × operation is the commutator, which measures the failure of commutativity in matrix multiplication. Instead of formula_18, the Lie bracket notation is used:
:formula_19

In that notation, the Jacobi identity is:
:formula_20
That is easily checked by computation.

More generally, if &#x27; is an associative algebra and &#x27; is a subspace of &#x27; that is closed under the bracket operation: formula_21 belongs to &#x27; for all formula_22, the Jacobi identity continues to hold on . Thus, if a binary operation formula_23 satisfies the Jacobi identity, it may be said that it behaves as if it were given by formula_24 in some associative algebra even if it is not actually defined that way.

Using the antisymmetry property formula_25, the Jacobi identity may be rewritten as a modification of the associative property:

:formula_26

If formula_27 is the action of the infinitesimal motion &#x27; on &#x27;, that can be stated as: 
There is also a plethora of graded Jacobi identities involving anticommutators formula_28, such as:

:formula_29
==Adjoint form==
Most common examples of the Jacobi identity come from the bracket multiplication formula_30 on Lie algebras and Lie rings. The Jacobi identity is written as:

: formula_31

Because the bracket multiplication is antisymmetric, the Jacobi identity admits two equivalent reformulations. Defining the adjoint operator formula_32, the identity becomes:
:formula_33

Thus, the Jacobi identity for Lie algebras states that the action of any element on the algebra is a derivation. That form of the Jacobi identity is also used to define the notion of Leibniz algebra.

Another rearrangement shows that the Jacobi identity is equivalent to the following identity between the operators of the adjoint representation:
:formula_34

There, the bracket on the left side is the operation of the original algebra, the bracket on the right is the commutator of the composition of operators, and the identity states that the formula_35 map sending each element to its adjoint action is a Lie algebra homomorphism.

== Related identities ==

* The Hall–Witt identity is the analogous identity for the commutator operation in a group.

* The following higher order Jacobi identity holds in arbitrary Lie algebra:

: formula_36

* The Jacobi identity is equivalent to the Product Rule, with the Lie bracket acting as both a product and a derivative: formula_37. If formula_38 are vector fields, then formula_23 is literally a derivative operator acting on formula_40, namely the Lie derivative formula_41.

<doc id="294374" wikidata="Q1758446" url="?curid=294374" title="Sigil">
<text>A sigil () is a type of symbol used in magic. The term usually refers to a pictorial signature of a spirit (such as an angel, demon, or deity). In modern usage, especially in the context of chaos magic, a sigil refers to a symbolic representation of the practitioner&#x27;s desired outcome.

==History==
The term &quot;sigil&quot; derives from the Latin (pl. ), meaning &quot;seal&quot;. In medieval magic, the term &quot;sigil&quot; was commonly used to refer to occult signs which represented various angels and demons which the practitioner might summon.

===&quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;===
Magical training books called grimoires often listed pages of such sigils. A particularly well-known list is in &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;, in which the sigils of the 72 princes of the hierarchy of hell are given for the magician&#x27;s use. Such sigils are considered by some to be the equivalent of the true name of the spirit and thus granted the magician a measure of control over the beings.

==Methods of construction==
A common method of creating the sigils of certain spirits was to use &quot;kameas&quot;, a special use case of magic squares—the names of the spirits were converted to numbers, which were then located on the magic square. The locations were then connected by lines, forming an abstract figure.

==Austin Osman Spare==
Artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare (1886–1956) developed his own unique method of creating and using sigils, which has had a huge effect on modern occultism. Spare did not agree with medieval practice of using these, arguing that such supernatural beings were simply complexes in the unconscious, and could be actively created through the process of sigilization.

Spare&#x27;s technique became a cornerstone of chaos magic. It also influenced artist Brion Gysin, who experimented with combining Spare&#x27;s sigil method with the traditional form of magic squares:

==Chaos magic==
In chaos magic, following Spare, sigils are commonly created in a well ordered fashion by writing an intention, then condensing the letters of the statement down to form a sort of monogram. The chaos magician then uses the gnostic state to &quot;launch&quot; or &quot;charge&quot; the sigil—essentially bypassing the conscious mind to implant the desire in the unconscious. To quote Ray Sherwin:

After charging the sigil, it is considered necessary to repress all memory of it. In the words of Spare, there should be &quot;a deliberate striving to forget it&quot;.

In modern chaos magic, when a complex of thoughts, desires, and intentions gains such a level of sophistication that it appears to operate autonomously from the magician&#x27;s consciousness, as if it were an independent being, then such a complex is referred to as a servitor. When such a being becomes large enough that it exists independently of any one individual, as a form of &quot;group mind&quot;, then it is referred to as an egregore.

Later chaos magicians have expanded on the basic sigilization technique. Grant Morrison coined the term &quot;hypersigil&quot; to refer to an extended work of art with magical meaning and willpower, created using adapted processes of sigilization. Their comic book series &quot;The Invisibles&quot; was intended as such a hypersigil. Morrison has also argued that modern corporate logos like &quot;the McDonald&#x27;s Golden Arches, the Nike swoosh and the Virgin autograph&quot; are a form of viral sigil:

<text>Genesis Breyer P-Orridge (22 February 1950 – 14 March 2020) was an English singer-songwriter, musician, poet, performance artist, visual artist, and occultist who rose to notoriety as the founder of the COUM Transmissions artistic collective and lead vocalist of seminal industrial band Throbbing Gristle. They were also a founding member of Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth occult group, and fronted the experimental pop rock band Psychic TV.
Born in Manchester, P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the avant-garde while at Solihull School. After dropping out of studies at the University of Hull, they moved into a counter-cultural commune in London and adopted &quot;Genesis P-Orridge&quot; as their pseudonym. On returning to Hull, they founded COUM Transmissions with Cosey Fanni Tutti, and in 1973 they relocated to London. COUM&#x27;s confrontational performance work, dealing with such subjects as sex work, pornography, serial killers, and occultism, represented a concerted attempt to challenge societal norms and attracted the attention of the national press. COUM&#x27;s 1976 &quot;Prostitution&quot; show at London&#x27;s Institute of Contemporary Arts was particularly vilified by tabloids, gaining them the moniker of the &quot;wreckers of civilisation.&quot; P-Orridge&#x27;s band, Throbbing Gristle, grew out of COUM, and were active from 1975 to 1981 as pioneers in the industrial music genre. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Psychic TV, an experimental band that from 1988 onward came under the increasing influence of acid house.
In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, an informal occult order influenced by chaos magic and experimental music. P-Orridge was seen as the group&#x27;s leader, but rejected that position, and left the group in 1991. Amid the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, a 1992 Channel 4 documentary accused P-Orridge of sexually abusing children, resulting in a police investigation. P-Orridge was subsequently cleared and Channel 4 retracted their allegation. As a result of the incident, P-Orridge left the United Kingdom for the United States and settled in New York City. There, they married Jacqueline Breyer, later known as Lady Jaye, in 1995, and together they embarked on the Pandrogeny Project, an attempt to unite as a &quot;pandrogyne&quot;, or single entity, through the use of surgical body modification to physically resemble one another. P-Orridge continued with this project of body modification after Lady Jaye&#x27;s 2007 death. Although involved in reunions of both Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV in the 2000s, they retired from music to focus on other artistic media in 2009.
P-Orridge was credited on over 200 releases during their lifetime. They were cited as an icon within the avant-garde art scene, accrued a cult following, and had been given the moniker of the &quot;Godparent of Industrial Music&quot;. P-Orridge considered themself third-gender and used various gender-neutral pronouns.

==Early life==

===1950–1964: Childhood===
Genesis P-Orridge was born on 22 February 1950 in Victoria Park, Manchester, to Ronald and Muriel Megson. Ronald was a travelling salesman who had worked in repertory theatre and who played the drums in local jazz and dance bands. Muriel was from Salford and had first met Ronald after he returned to England after being injured with the British Army at the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940. As a child, they had a good relationship with their parents, who did not interfere with their artistic interests.

Due to Ronald&#x27;s job, the family moved to Essex, where they attended Staples Road Infant School in Loughton, and for a time lived in a caravan near to Epping Forest while the family house was being completed. The family then moved from Essex to Cheshire, where they attended Gatley Primary School. Passing the 11-plus exam, they won a scholarship to attend Stockport Grammar School, doing so between 1961 and 1964.

===1964–1968: Solihull School and Worm===
After their father became the Midlands area manager of a cleaning and maintenance business, they were sent to the privately run Solihull School in Warwickshire between 1964 and 1968; a period they would refer to as &quot;basically four years of being mentally and physically tortured&quot;, but also a time when they developed an interest in art, occultism and the avant-garde. At age fifteen, they became a fan of &quot;The Hundred Headless Woman,&quot; a book that contained surrealist collages by various artists, including Max Ernst. The book became an early source of inspiration, and it was at that time that they took on the name &quot;P-Orridge.&quot;

Unpopular with other pupils, they were bullied at the school, finding comfort in the art department at lunch-time and in the evenings. They befriended Ian &quot;Spydeee&quot; Evetts, Barry &quot;Little Baz&quot; Hermon and Paul Wolfson, three fellow pupils who shared their interest in art, literature, and poetry. They regularly discussed books and music, developing an interest in the writings of Aleister Crowley, William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg and the music of Frank Zappa, the Fugs and the Velvet Underground. They became interested in occultism, and also asserted that their grandmother was a medium.

In 1967, P-Orridge founded their first collective, Worm, with school friends Pingle Wad (Peter Winstanley), Spydeee Gasmantell (Ian Evetts) and P-Orridge&#x27;s girlfriend Jane Ray. Worm was influenced by AMM and John Cage&#x27;s 1961 book &quot;&quot;. In 1966, P-Orridge, Evetts, Hermon, Wolfson, and Winstanley began production of an underground magazine, entitled &quot;Conscience&quot;. Forbidden from selling it on school grounds, they sold copies outside the school gates. Included in &quot;Conscience&quot; were various articles criticising the school&#x27;s administration, leading to proposed changes regarding such issues as school uniforms and prefects (known as benchers) privileges. That same year, influenced by newspaper accounts of &quot;Swinging London&quot;, they organised the first happening at the school, doing so under the auspices of organising a school dance.

Brought up in the Anglican denomination of Christianity, P-Orridge became secretary of the school sixth form&#x27;s Christian Discussion Circle, in this position inviting members of other ideological positions – including a Marxist from the British Communist Party – to speak to the group. Aged 18, P-Orridge began helping to run the local Sunday school classes, but came to reject organised Christianity. Afflicted with asthma throughout childhood, P-Orridge had to take cortisone and prednisone steroids to control the attacks. The latter of these drugs caused their adrenal glands to atrophy as a side-effect, and so the doctor advised P-Orridge to stop taking them. As a result, aged 17, P-Orridge suffered from a serious blackout; while in hospital recovering they decided to devote their life to art and writing.

With Hermon and Wolfson, P-Orridge founded a group called the Knights of the Pentecostal Flame. The Knights undertook a happening on 1 June 1968 which they titled &quot;Beautiful Litter&quot;. Taking place in Mell Square, Solihull, it involved the three students handing out cards to passersby that had a series of words written onto them; &quot;fleece&quot;, &quot;rainbow&quot;, &quot;silken&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;flower&quot; and &quot;dewdrops&quot;. Ensuring that the local &quot;Solihull News&quot; was informed of the event, P-Orridge told reporters that the Knights wanted to ignite &quot;an artistic revolution in Solihull, by making people aware of the life around them, its essential beauty and tranquillity.&quot; In mid-1968, Worm recorded their first and only album, entitled &quot;Early Worm&quot;, in P-Orridge&#x27;s parents&#x27; attic in Solihull. It was pressed onto vinyl in November at Deroy Sound Services in Manchester, but only one copy was ever produced. A second album, &quot;Catching the Bird&quot;, was recorded but never pressed.

=== 1968–1969: Hull University and Transmedia Explorations===
In September 1968, P-Orridge began studying for a degree in Social Administration and Philosophy at the University of Hull. Hull was chosen in an attempt to study at &quot;the most ordinary non-elitist, working-class, red brick university&quot;, but P-Orridge disliked the course and unsuccessfully tried to transfer to study English. With a group of friends, P-Orridge founded a &#x27;free-form&#x27; student magazine entitled &quot;Worm&quot; which waived all editorial control, publishing everything placed into the magazine&#x27;s pigeonhole, including instructions on how to build a molotov cocktail. Three issues were published between 1968 and 1970 before the Hull Student&#x27;s Union banned the publication, considering it legally obscene and fearing prosecution. Developing a keen interest in poetry, P-Orridge won the 1969 Hull University Needler Poetry Competition, judged by Compton lecturer Richard Murphy and the poet Philip Larkin, who was then librarian at the university. P-Orridge became involved in radical student politics through their friendship with Tom Fawthrop, a member of the Radical Student Alliance who had led a student occupation of the university&#x27;s administrative buildings as a part of the worldwide student protests of 1968. In 1969, P-Orridge attempted to reconstruct the occupation for a film, in the hopes that it would itself become a genuine protest occupation, but this venture failed due to a lack of participants.

In 1969, P-Orridge dropped out of university and moved to London, and joined the Transmedia Explorations commune, who were then living in a large run-down house in Islington Park Street. The group, initiated by the artist David Medalla and initially named the Exploding Galaxy, had been at the forefront of the London hippy scene since 1967, but had partially disbanded after a series of police raids and a damaging court case. Moving into their commune, P-Orridge was particularly influenced by one of the founding members of the group, Gerald Fitzgerald, a kinetic artist, and would recognise Fitzgerald&#x27;s formative influence in P-Orridge&#x27;s later work. The commune members adhered to a strict regime with the intention of deconditioning its members out of their routines and conventional behaviour; they were forbidden from sleeping in the same place on consecutive nights, food was cooked at irregular times of the day and all clothing was kept in a communal chest, with its members wearing something different on each day. P-Orridge stayed there for three months, until late October 1969. They left after becoming angered that the commune&#x27;s leaders were given more rights than the other members and believing that the group ignored the counter-cultural use of music, something they took a great interest in. Julie Wilson later stated that although P-Orridge&#x27;s time at the Transmedia Explorations commune had been brief, &quot;the experiences (they) had there proved to be seminal&quot; to their artistic development.

==COUM Transmissions==

===1969–1970: Founding COUM Transmissions===

Leaving London, P-Orridge hitch-hiked across Britain before settling down in a new home in Shrewsbury. Here, they volunteered as an office clerk in Ronald Megson&#x27;s new business. On one family trip to Wales, P-Orridge was sitting in the back of the car, then &quot;became disembodied and heard voices and saw the COUM symbol and heard the words &#x27;COUM Transmissions. Returning home that evening, P-Orridge filled three notebooks with artistic thoughts and ideas, influenced by the time spent at Transmedia Explorations.

In November 1969, P-Orridge returned to Hull to meet up with friend John Shapeero, who partnered with P-Orridge to turn COUM Transmissions into an avant-garde artistic and musical troupe. They initially debated as to how to define &quot;COUM&quot;, later deciding that like the name &quot;dada&quot; it should remain open to interpretation. P-Orridge designed a logo for the group, consisting of a semi-erect penis formed out of the word COUM with a drip of semen coming out of the end, while the motto &quot;Your Local Dirty Banned&quot; (a pun on &quot;band&quot;) was emblazoned underneath. Another logo designed by P-Orridge consisted of a hand-drawn seal accompanied by the statement &quot;COUM guarantee disappointment&quot;; from their early foundation, the group made use of wordplay in their artworks and adverts.

COUM&#x27;s earliest public events were impromptu musical gigs performed at various pubs around Hull; titles for these events included &quot;Thee Fabulous Mutations&quot;, &quot;Space Between the Violins&quot;, &quot;Dead Violins and Degradation&quot;, and &quot;Clockwork Hot Spoiled Acid Test&quot;. The latter combined the names of Anthony Burgess&#x27; dystopian science-fiction novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1962) with Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (1968), a work of literary journalism devoted to the Merry Pranksters, a US communal counter-cultural group who advocated the use of psychedelic drugs. COUM&#x27;s music was anarchic and improvised, making use of such instruments as broken violins, prepared pianos, guitars, bongos and talking drums. As time went on, they added further theatrics to their performances, in one instance making the audience crawl through a polythene tunnel to enter the venue.

In December 1969, P-Orridge and Shapeero moved out of their flat and into a former fruit warehouse in Hull&#x27;s docking area, overlooking the Humber. Named the Ho-Ho Funhouse by P-Orridge, the warehouse became the communal home to an assortment of counter-cultural figures, including artists, musicians, fashion designers and underground magazine producers. At Christmas 1969, a woman named Christine Carol Newby moved into the Funhouse after being thrown out of her home by her father. Having earlier befriended them at an acid test party, Newby became P-Orridge&#x27;s roommate at the Funhouse, first taking the name Cosmosis, but latterly adopting the stage name Cosey Fanni Tutti after the title of Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s 1790 opera &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;. Joining COUM, Tutti initially helped in building props and designing costumes, and was there when the group began including performance art and more theatrical happenings in its music events; Evetts, aka Spydeee Gasmantell, after being expelled from Solihull School joined COUM. The three of them lived in a derelict Georgian warehouse in Prince Street, Hull. An example performance involved the group turning up to play a gig but intentionally not bringing any instruments, something P-Orridge considered &quot;much more theatrical, farcical and light-hearted&quot; than their earlier performances.

=== 1971–1973: Activities in Hull===
On 5 January 1971, P-Orridge underwent a legal name change to Genesis P-Orridge by deed poll, combining the adopted nickname Genesis with an altered spelling of &quot;porridge&quot;, the foodstuff which they had lived off as a student. The new name was intentionally un-glamorous, and they hoped that it would trigger a personal &quot;genius factor&quot;. In February, COUM caught the attention of &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot;, which featured an article on them that led to further media attention from national newspapers. They also featured in an article in &quot;Torch&quot;, the publication of the University of Hull&#x27;s student union, entitled &quot;God Sucks Mary&#x27;s Hairy Nipple&quot;; the article&#x27;s author, Haydn Robb (nowadays known as Haydn Nobb), subsequently joined COUM, as did maths lecturer Tim Poston. In April 1971, COUM, consisting of P-Orridge and Gasmantell, broadcast their first live radio session, for the &quot;On Cue&quot; programme for Radio Humberside. Following up the press attention they received, they performed further happenings, including their first street action, &quot;Absolute Everywhere&quot;, which brought problems with the police.

After performing another set, &quot;Riot Control&quot;, at Hull&#x27;s Gondola Club, the premises were raided by police and closed soon after; most local clubs blamed COUM and unofficially banned them. COUM drew up a petition to gain support for the group, attaining a booking at the local Brickhouse; their first performance in which the audience applauded and called for an encore. The petition had contained their phallic logo, and the police charged P-Orridge and Robb with publishing an obscene advert, although the charges were later dropped. As they gained coverage in the music press, interest in the band grew, and they supported Hawkwind at St. George&#x27;s Hall in Bradford in October 1971, where they performed a piece called &quot;Edna and the Great Surfers&quot;, where they led the crowd in shouting &quot;Off, Off, Off&quot;. The following month, the band attracted the interest of music journalist John Peel, who publicly remarked that &quot;[s]ome might say that Coum were madmen but constant exposure to mankind forces me to believe that we need more madmen like them.&quot;

Gaining an Experimental Arts Grant from the publicly funded Yorkshire Arts Association, COUM described themselves as performance artists, being inspired by the Dadaists and emphasising the amateur quality of their work. They entered the National Rock/Folk Contest at Hull&#x27;s New Grange Club with a set titled &quot;This Machine Kills Music&quot;, and organised events for Hull City Council&#x27;s celebrations to mark the UK&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community in 1973. They had also worked on solo projects, generating controversy in the local press over a conceptual artwork the artist entered at a local exhibition. Taking an increasing interest in infantilism, P-Orridge founded the fictitious L&#x27;ecole de l&#x27;art infantile and co-organised the &quot;Baby&#x27;s Coumpetition&quot; at Oxford University&#x27;s 1973 May Festival, also producing material as the fictitious Ministry of Antisocial Insecurity, a parody of the Ministry of Social Security. Meanwhile, P-Orridge created the character of Alien Brain, and in July 1972, performed as the character at an event entitled the &quot;World Premiere of the Alien Brain&quot;, at Hull Arts Centre. COUM also began publishing books; in 1972, they brought out the first volume of &quot;The Million and One Names of COUM&quot;, part of a proposed project to release 1001 slogans (such as &quot;A thousand and one ways to COUM&quot; and &quot;COUM are Fab and Kinky&quot;), while in 1973 P-Orridge published &quot;Copyright Breeches&quot;, which explored an ongoing personal fascination with the copyright symbol and its implications for art and society.

===1973–1975: London and growing fame===
Following continual police harassment, P-Orridge and Tutti relocated to London, moving into a squat and obtaining a basement studio in Hackney which they named the &quot;Death Factory&quot;. After a brief correspondence, P-Orridge met American novelist and poet William S. Burroughs. Brion Gysin would become a major influence upon P-Orridge&#x27;s ideas and works and was the latter&#x27;s primary tutor in spiritual magic. 1973 saw COUM take part in the &quot;Fluxshoe&quot; retrospective that toured Britain exhibiting the work of the Fluxus artists; it was organised by David Mayor, who befriended P-Orridge. At that year&#x27;s Edinburgh Festival, P-Orridge undertook a Marcel Duchamp-inspired performance art piece, &quot;Art Vandals&quot;, at the Richard Demarco Gallery, engaging guests in unconventional conversation, and spilling their food and drink on the floor. Exhibiting alongside the Viennese Actionists, P-Orridge came under increasing influence from these Austrian performance artists, adopting their emphasis on using shock tactics to combat conventional morality. P-Orridge&#x27;s first film, &quot;Wundatrek Tours&quot;, was released in September 1973, and documented a day out to Brighton. Throughout the year the artist sent personally designed postcards to mail-art shows across the world.

In January 1974, COUM returned their attention to music, collaborating with the Canadian artist Clive Robertson to produce &quot;Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s Next Work&quot;, which they premiered at an arts festival in the Zwarte Zaal Royal Conservatory of Ghent in Ghent, Belgium. COUM&#x27;s next major work was &quot;Couming of Age&quot;, performed in March 1974 at the Oval House in Kennington, South London. After the show, they were approached by an audience member, Peter Christopherson, who shared many of their interests; P-Orridge and Tutti nicknamed him &quot;Sleazy&quot; because of the former&#x27;s particular interest in the sexual aspects of COUM&#x27;s work. Christopherson began to aid them using their skills as a photographer and graphic designer, and would first perform with them in their March 1975 work &quot;Couming of Youth&quot;. In May 1974, COUM issued a manifesto published on an A3 double-sided sheet titled &quot;Decoumpositions and Events&quot;.

In April 1974, the Arts Council of Great Britain gave COUM the first half of a £1,500 grant. The money stabilised the group, which now included P-Orridge and Tutti as directors, John Gunni Busck as technical director, and Lelli Maull as musical director. During that year, they made use of various artist-run venues in London, most notably the Art Meeting Place (AMP) in Covent Garden, where they regularly performed during 1974. A number of these works entailed P-Orridge and Tutti exploring the gender balance, including concepts of gender confusion. In one performance at the AWB, which was titled &quot;Filth&quot;, P-Orridge and Tutti performed sexual acts using a double-ended dildo. COUM were frustrated with the restrictions imposed on them by the Arts Council as a prerequisite for receiving funding; rather than performing at Council-accredited venues, they wanted to perform more spontaneously. In August 1974 they carried out a spontaneous unauthorised piece of performance art in Brook Green, Hammersmith; during the performance, police arrived and put a stop to the event, deeming it obscene.

In September 1974, COUM were invited to attend the Stadfest in Rottweil, West Germany, and they proceeded with a travel grant from the British Council. There, they published two performance art actions in the street, earning them praise from Bridget Riley and Ernst Jandl, both of whom were present. The acclaim that COUM received at Rottweil established the group&#x27;s reputation as &quot;one of the most innovative performance art groups then on the London art scene&quot;, convincing the Arts Council and British Council to take them more seriously and offer them greater support.

In February 1975, P-Orridge gained their first full-time job, working as an assistant editor at St. James Press, in which they helped to compile the &quot;Contemporary Artists&quot; reference book. The work meant that they had less time to devote to COUM but gained a wide range of contacts in the art world. During that year, COUM embarked on a series of five performance pieces which it termed &quot;Omissions&quot;; these were performed across Europe. In March 1975, COUM performed &quot;Couming of Youth&quot; at the Melkweg in Amsterdam. Adopting a more violent stance than their previous work – in this reflecting an influence from the Viennese Actionists – the performance involved self-mutilation, Cosey inserting lighted candles into her vagina, P-Orridge being crucified and whipped, and P-Orridge and Cosey having sexual intercourse. At Southampton&#x27;s Nuffield Festival in July 1975, COUM performed &quot;Studio of Lust&quot;, where P-Orridge publicly masturbated and all of the members undressed and adopted sexual poses.

===1975–1976: Establishing Throbbing Gristle and the &quot;Prostitution&quot; show===

COUM were introduced to Chris Carter in 1975 through their mutual friend John Lacey. Lacey believed that Carter would be interested in COUM as a result of his particular interest in the experimental use of light and sound. Together, Carter, Christopherson, Cosey and P-Orridge founded a musical band, Throbbing Gristle, on 3 September 1975; they had deliberately chosen that date for it was the 36th anniversary of the United Kingdom joining the Second World War. The term &quot;throbbing gristle&quot; was deliberately chosen for it was a Yorkshire slang term for an erect penis. Throbbing Gristle, or TG as it was widely known, was aimed at a wider audience than COUM, thereby aiming to work within popular culture rather than the elite realm of the art scene. COUM and TG were largely treated as distinct entities; the music press ignored COUM and saw TG as experimental art rock, while the arts press ignored TG, viewing COUM as performance artists. Despite their intention of operating within the realms of popular culture, TG never had chart success, and remained a cult band; their audience was far larger than COUM.

COUM continued to operate alongside TG, and in October 1975 they performed &quot;Jusquà la balle crystal&quot; at the Ninth Paris Biennale at the Musée d&#x27;art modern. The prestige of being invited to such an event led to the Arts Council awarding them a grant for £1,600, although only the first half of this was ever paid out. COUM&#x27;s mail art had taken on an increasingly pornographic dimension, and in November 1975 the police charged P-Orridge with distributing obscene material via in the postal system under the 1953 Post Office Act; this trial was set for February 1976.
They were prosecuted in 1975 for making collages combining postcards of Queen Elizabeth with soft-core porn, but the jail term and fines were suspended on condition they did not continue.

Their &quot;Prostitution&quot; show, in 1976 at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London, included displays of Tutti&#x27;s pornographic images from magazines as well as erotic nude photographs; the show featured a stripper, used tampons in glass, and transvestite guards. Prostitutes, punks, and people in costumes were among those hired to mingle with the gallery audience. The show caused debate in Parliament about the public funding of such events. In the House of Commons, Scottish Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn demanded an explanation from Arts Minister Harold Lever and proclaimed P-Orridge and Tutti as &quot;wreckers of civilisation&quot;. Fleet Street was not slow to pick up the story. The reviews were cut up, framed, and put on display for the remainder of the exhibition. This was also reported in newspapers, so cut-ups about the cut-ups were also put on display. COUM was found so offensive that it lost its government grant, and went on to become the private company Industrial Records. Toward the end of COUM, performances would often consist of only P-Orridge, Cosey and Sleazy, the core group who went on to form Throbbing Gristle.

==Throbbing Gristle==

Throbbing Gristle was formed in late 1975 as a four-piece band, consisting of P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti, Peter &quot;Sleazy&quot; Christopherson and Chris Carter. P-Orridge&#x27;s involvement in Throbbing Gristle led to the artist being regularly cited as the &quot;Godfather of Industrial Music&quot;, or in some later sources, &quot;godparent&quot;.

The first Throbbing Gristle performance was held at the Air Gallery in London in July 1976. At that point, Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s headquarters was located at 10 Martello Street, Hackney, East London, the address of an artist collective. P-Orridge and Tutti&#x27;s living and work space was the postal address of Industrial Records (IR). TG came to be identified as the founders of industrial music, although at the same time the academic Drew Daniel asserted that as a result of its eclecticism, their music resists clear analysis.

Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s best-selling single was &quot;Zyklon B Zombie&quot; (1978), the title being a reference to the Zyklon B poison gas used at Auschwitz extermination camp. With their album &quot;20 Jazz Funk Greats&quot; they attempted to move away from their industrial sound, and produced songs in a variety of different musical genres. P-Orridge received a number of threatening phone calls, proceeding to record them and use them as a backing track for the TG song &quot;Death Threats&quot;. Throbbing Gristle released &quot;Discipline&quot; in 1980.

The final IR release was called &quot;Nothing Here Now But the Recordings&quot;, a best-of album taken from the archives of William S. Burroughs, who provided P-Orridge and Christopherson with access to his reel-to-reel tape archive.

The final Throbbing Gristle live event, &quot;Mission of Dead Souls&quot;, occurred in May 1981 at the Kezar Pavilion in San Francisco. Shortly after the San Francisco event, P-Orridge and Paula Brooking were married.

During this period, P-Orridge befriended an English musician named David Bunting; P-Orridge already knew another man named David, so coined the moniker David Tibet, which Bunting adopted as a stage name. Through an introduction provided by Burroughs, P-Orridge met Brion Gysin in Paris, probably in 1980, coming to be deeply influenced by Gysin&#x27;s cut-up method; P-Orridge understood this to be a revolutionary method of escaping current patterns of thought and developing something new.

==Psychic TV and Thee Temple Ov Psychic Youth==
Following the break-up of Throbbing Gristle, in 1981 P-Orridge founded a band with Peter Christopherson and Alex Fergusson that they named Psychic TV. Involved in video art, they also performed psychedelic, punk, electronic and experimental music. The decision to name the band &quot;Psychic TV&quot; stemmed from P-Orridge&#x27;s belief that while mainstream television was a form of mass indoctrination and mind control, it could be used as an &quot;esoterrorist&quot; form of magick to combat the establishment&#x27;s control. Historian Dave Evans described Psychic TV as &quot;a band dedicated to musical eclecticism and magical experiment, their performances being in part ritual (ab)use of sound samples, the creation of &#x27;auditory magical sigils&#x27; and the destruction of consensus language in order to find meaning&quot;.

The band&#x27;s first song, &quot;Just Drifting&quot;, was based on a poem by P-Orridge. For their first album, &quot;Force the Hand of Chance&quot; (1982), P-Orridge used a kangling, or Tibetan trumpet made out of a human thigh-bone; the instrument had been introduced to P-Orridge by David Tibet, and attracted attention to their music. P-Orridge had become acquainted with Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan and ideologue of LaVeyan Satanism, with LaVey making an appearance on the Psychic TV song &quot;Joy&quot;, in which he recites the Lord&#x27;s Prayer backwards. 

Psychic TV made its debut in 1982 at an event organised by P-Orridge, David Dawson, and Roger Ely, called &quot;The Final Academy&quot;. It was a 4-day multimedia celebratory rally held in Manchester and at the Ritzy Cinema in Brixton, South London. It brought performers and audience together with literature, performance, film and music. PTV, Cabaret Voltaire, 23 Skidoo, Z&#x27;EV, John Giorno, William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Terry Wilson, Jeff Nuttall, and the Last Few Days participated to honour the cut-up techniques and theories of William S. Burroughs, Ian Sommerville, Antony Balch and Gysin. Video projection and early sampling were used here, as well as whispered utterances by P-Orridge reprocessed as a soundtrack to Gysin&#x27;s Dreammachine by the Hafler Trio. In the mid-1980s, Psychic TV aimed to release a live album on the 23rd of each month for 23 months in recognition of the 23 enigma. The group did not reach its goal but still managed fourteen albums in eighteen months, thus earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. Following the culmination of Psychic TV but before embarking on Thee Majesty, P-Orridge and several Psychic TV musicians formed Splinter Test, a name adopted from one of P-Orridge&#x27;s essays on sampling. From 1988, the band came under the increasing influence of the acid house genre of dance music, and were responsible for helping the popularisation of acid house music in Europe.

In 1981, P-Orridge also founded a loosely organised network of occultists named Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY), with the aid of John Balance, Tibet, and a number of members of the Process Church of the Final Judgement, a group which had exerted an influence on P-Orridge&#x27;s occult thought. TOPY was conceived not as an occult order of teaching, but a forum to facilitate discussions on occult ideas by like-minded people, and from its beginnings was understood by its founders to be a successor to the late 19th and early 20th century Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), especially as the latter had been run under Crowley&#x27;s leadership. Evans described TOPY as &quot;a &#x27;fusion&#x27; organisation, creating a crossover of punk/experimental music with chaos magical thinking and practice&quot;, making particular use of the sigilisation practices of occult artist Austin Osman Spare. Journalist Gavin Baddeley described TOPY as &quot;perhaps the most influential new occult order of the 1980s&quot;. P-Orridge had never wanted to be seen as the leader of an occult order, although many of those involved in TOPY were frustrated that outsiders regularly described P-Orridge as the group&#x27;s leader. Accordingly, P-Orridge separated from TOPY in 1991, although it continued as a fan community after the departure.

Having been encouraged by groups involved in propagating the moral panic about alleged Satanic ritual abuse, the Channel 4 1992 documentary show &quot;Dispatches&quot; claimed to have discovered videotapes depicting P-Orridge sexually abusing children in a ritual setting. Police from the Obscene Publications Squad subsequently raided P-Orridge&#x27;s home, and confiscated several tonnes of art work. At the time, P-Orridge was in Thailand undertaking famine relief work; fearing arrest and loss of child custody upon return to the UK, P-Orridge stayed out of the country for several years, settling in the United States. P-Orridge believed that the negative press and police attention were the result of a campaign organised by a Christian group. It was subsequently revealed that the footage obtained did not depict child abuse. Instead, it was a video artwork titled &quot;First Transmissions&quot; that had been made in the early 1980s, partially funded by Channel 4 itself; the footage depicted sex-magic rites between adults, bloodletting performances, and scenes of the filmmaker Derek Jarman reading passages from the work of Geoffrey Chaucer. Embarrassed by these revelations, Channel 4 retracted its initial accusations.

In 2016, the film director Jacqueline Castel began work on the feature-length documentary titled &quot;A Message from the Temple&quot;, about Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth and P-Orridge.

==Later life==

===1993–2009: The Pandrogeny Project===
At 45 years of age P-Orridge met Lady Jaye (née Jacqueline Breyer) in a BDSM dungeon in New York City and would eventually marry for a second time. Jaye worked as a nurse during the daytime, providing care for children with terminal illnesses and disabilities. In the evenings, Lady Jaye worked as a dominatrix at the dungeon, and Genesis was a visiting customer. The night they met, the two visited Paddles, an underground BDSM club in Manhattan. The two became a couple from that point forward.

In January 1993, P-Orridge and Jaye moved to Ridgewood, Queens, in New York City. Here, they embarked on the &quot;Pandrogeny Project&quot;; influenced by the cut-up technique, the duo underwent body modification to resemble one another, thus coming to identify themselves as a single pandrogynous being named &quot;Breyer P-Orridge&quot;. In doing so, the pair spent $200,000 on surgical alteration, receiving breast implants, cheek and chin implants, lip plumping, eye and nose jobs, tattooing, and hormone therapy, while also adopting gender neutral and alternating pronouns. With this project, P-Orridge&#x27;s intent was to express a belief that the self is pure consciousness trapped within the DNA-governed body. The couple adopted the term &quot;pandrogyne&quot; because – in their words – &quot;we wanted a word without any history or any connections with things – a word with its own story and its own information&quot;.
They also stated that:

During this era, a book was published of P-Orridge&#x27;s writings, poems, and observations, called &quot;Ooh, You Are Awful ... But I Like You!&quot;. In the mid-1990s, P-Orridge collaborated with different people in music, including Pigface, Skinny Puppy, and Download. P-Orridge also performed with Nik Turner and other former members of Hawkwind.
In June 1998, P-Orridge won a $1.5 million lawsuit against producer Rick Rubin and his American Recordings label for injuries sustained while trying to escape a fire at Rubin&#x27;s home in April 1995. According to P-Orridge&#x27;s attorney, David D. Stein, P-Orridge was staying at Rubin&#x27;s home, as a guest of Love and Rockets, when the fire broke out. P-Orridge tried to escape the house by crawling through a second-storey window and fell onto concrete stairs. P-Orridge suffered a broken wrist, broken ribs, and a pulmonary embolism, as well as a shattered left elbow that, according to Stein, prevented P-Orridge from playing bass or keyboards. They remained in hospital for a total of ten days. The jury found that the liability for the fire rested with Rubin and American Recordings, and awarded P-Orridge US$1,572,000 in compensation.

In 1999, P-Orridge performed with the briefly reunited late-1980s version of Psychic TV for an event at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall, called &quot;Time&#x27;s Up&quot;. The MC for the event, via pre-recorded video, was Quentin Crisp, it was recorded and released as a DVD. &quot;Time&#x27;s Up&quot; is also the title of the first CD by Thee Majesty, P-Orridge&#x27;s spoken-word project with &quot;noise&quot; guitarist, Bryin Dall.

In December 2003, P-Orridge, using the alias &quot;Djinn&quot;, unveiled PTV3, a new act drawing upon the early &quot;Hyperdelic&quot; work of Psychic TV with media theorist Douglas Rushkoff among its members. On 16 May 2004, all four former members of Throbbing Gristle performed at the London Astoria for the first time in 23 years.

P-Orridge appeared in the 1998 film and 2000 book versions of &quot;Modulations&quot;, as well as appearing in the 1999 film &quot;Better Living Through Circuitry&quot;, the 2004 film &quot;DiG!&quot;, Bruce LaBruce&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;The Raspberry Reich&quot;, the 2006 documentary &quot;&quot;, in Nik Sheehan&#x27;s 2007 feature documentary on the Dreamachine entitled &quot;FLicKeR&quot;, the 2010 documentary &quot;William S. Burroughs: A Man Within&quot;, and the 2011 film &quot;The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye&quot;.

In January 2006, the new PTV album was announced on P-Orridge&#x27;s website. &quot;Hell Is Invisible... Heaven Is Her/e&quot; was recorded in NYC and features Nick Zinner (Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and Gibby Haynes (Butthole Surfers) guesting on some tracks. To inaugurate the release of &quot;Hell Is Invisible ... Heaven Is Her/e&quot;, PTV3 hosted a five night residency in September 2006 at Galapagos Art Space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. &quot;Mr. Alien Brain Vs. the Skinwalkers&quot; was released on Sweet Nothing Records on 8 December 2008.

On 9 October 2007, Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge died. The cause of death was heart arrhythmia, a heart condition that was possibly related to stomach cancer. Psychic TV cancelled its North American tour dates in the aftermath of Lady Jaye&#x27;s death. A memorial was held at the Participant Inc. Gallery in New York City on 8 March 2008 . As of January 2013, P-Orridge&#x27;s official website said:

Thus, P-Orridge continued the Pandrogyne Project, having further surgical operations to alter their body and using &quot;we&quot; when in reference to themselves; to a reporter P-Orridge admitted that without Lady Jaye:

From this point, P-Orridge began referring to themselves in the plural in order to keep Breyer&#x27;s memory alive.

In 2013, Dale Eisinger of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked the Pandrogeny project the greatest work of performance art ever.

===2009–2020: Semi-retirement, illness and death===
In September 2009, a retrospective of P-Orridge&#x27;s collages, entitled &quot;30 Years of Being Cut Up&quot;, opened at Invisible-Exports.
On 4 November 2009 it was announced that P-Orridge would retire from touring in any and all bands (including Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV) to concentrate on art, writing and music. In June 2010, P-Orridge sold the Ridgewood property, holding a garage sale in the basement of a local art gallery to sell off a range of personal items, in addition to an array of dildos. This accomplished, P-Orridge moved to a one-bedroom apartment in New York&#x27;s Lower East Side, and continued producing art in this home.

P-Orridge visited Australia for the first (and only) time in 2012, performing two live shows with Psychic TV; one as part of the Adelaide Festival, and another secret show in Melbourne following a screening of the documentary film &quot;The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye&quot;. P-Orridge returned to regular touring with Psychic TV in 2016, in support of the release of their album &quot;Alienist&quot;. The tour lasted from mid-September to early December, with concerts in Greece, Israel, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States.

In August 2015, P-Orridge gained publicity for an interview critical of Caitlyn Jenner&#x27;s self-description as a &quot;spokesperson&quot; for the transgender community, stating that Jenner was &quot;clueless&quot; and did not know what life was like for the majority of transgender people around the world. In mid-2016, P-Orridge&#x27;s artwork was the subject of an exhibition, &quot;Try to Altar Everything&quot;, at the Rubin Museum of Art in New York City. The exhibition contained paintings, sculptures, and installations inspired by the Hindu mythology that P-Orridge had encountered in Kathmandu. In June 2016, P-Orridge was featured as a model in a campaign by the designer Marc Jacobs, who described P-Orridge as &quot;a sort of come-to-life definition of realness and authenticity&quot;.

P-Orridge was diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia in October 2017, and died in New York City on 14 March 2020, aged 70. P-Orridge&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Nonbinary,&quot; was published a year later, in June 2021, a project P-Orridge had been working on in collaboration with writer Tim Mohr for several years, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

==Work==

Influenced by concepts from both Western esotericism and contemporary Paganism, P-Orridge&#x27;s work is designed to confront the audience with ways of thinking alien to the mainstream values of Western society. The religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge characterised P-Orridge&#x27;s work as being a &quot;confluence of pornography, violence, death, degradation, the confrontation of taboo subjects, noise and Paganism&quot;, deliberately courting controversy and expressing an anti-establishment stance. Partridge suggested that this intent to shock emerged both out of a serious attempt to highlight the mechanisms of social control in Western society and also out of &quot;a juvenile delight gained from extreme behaviour and the offence caused&quot;.

P-Orridge&#x27;s work was particularly influenced by the early 20th-century English artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare, who shared their disdain for mainstream morality and fascination with sexuality and the human body. P-Orridge adopted Spare&#x27;s views on sigils, coming to see their own work as a form of sigil magic. Spare&#x27;s sigilisation process entailed writing down one&#x27;s desires, before crossing out any letters that are repeated and then combining the remaining letters into an abstract design, or sigil; the magician must then focus on that sigil and mentally absorb it, and – according to Spare&#x27;s claims – psychic energies operating on the subconscious ensure that the original desire is manifested in reality. P-Orridge adopted this theory, believing that their work operates according to its principles.

A further element of P-Orridge&#x27;s work is their common use of idiosyncratic grammar and spelling, such as &quot;Thee&quot; in place of &quot;the&quot;, &quot;ov&quot; in place of &quot;of&quot; and (especially in early writings) &quot;butter&quot; in place of &quot;but&quot;. The purpose of this is to challenge thought and established ways of reading.

==Personal life==

P-Orridge had two daughters with former wife Paula P-Orridge (born Paula Brooking). An interview with Genesis and Paula P-Orridge appeared in the book &quot;RE/Search: Modern Primitives&quot; in 1989, and the Icelandic publication &quot;Eintak&quot; in 1994.

On a religious or spiritual level, Christopher Partridge described P-Orridge as representing &quot;a particularly interesting, influential and subversive example of contemporary paganism&quot;. Asserting that their &quot;industrial paganism&quot; was different from most forms of contemporary paganism, Partridge described it as &quot;confrontational, subversive, experimental and, to a large extent, dystopian&quot;, with it serving as &quot;an ideological tool&quot; with which to analyse society &quot;from its underbelly; an immersion in the dark side; the subversion of Christian hegemony, conservative politics and what nowadays might be described as neoliberalism&quot;. P-Orridge was devoted to the deity Eshu Elegguá, an entity from the Afro-Caribbean syncretic religion of Santería. P-Orridge also stated disbelief in the literal existence of gods, deeming such entities to instead be &quot;early attempts at psychology, trying to understand the light and dark side of human nature&quot;.

P-Orridge vociferously criticised contemporary Christianity, describing it as &quot;an incredibly sick social pseudo-religion&quot;, and arguing that it was based upon the tenet of &quot;Be good now, agree, or else we will punish you forever and ever when you&#x27;re dead. And we may punish you while you&#x27;re alive ...&quot; P-Orridge maintained that such an attitude was established in Christianity by St. Paul and the early Roman Catholic Church, and that it differed from the &quot;ecstatic mysticism of the original Christianity, the Gnostic Christianity&quot;.

In her memoir, &quot;Art Sex Music&quot;, former bandmate Cosey Fanni Tutti claimed P-Orridge had been abusive during their relationship. P-Orridge denied the allegations.

==Reception and legacy==
According to &quot;New York&quot; magazine, P-Orridge became &quot;an icon of the London avant-garde&quot; in 1976. Writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 2016, the reporter Hermione Hoby described P-Orridge as a &quot;cult figure&quot; considered to be &quot;a treasure of the avant-garde by global art institutions&quot;.

The quote that P-Orridge attributed to their mentor, &quot;I feel your pain, I feel your shame, but you&#x27;re not to blame&quot;, was used as the catchphrase for the Shirley Ghostman psychic clairvoyant character by comedian Marc Wootton.

P-Orridge&#x27;s mock-cult of TOPY has been criticized as being a front for abuses of power and developing a cult of personality.

Musician Electrosexual and Syrian German industrial/techno artist Hanin Elias, founding member of Atari Teenage Riot, recorded a cover version of &quot;Hot on the Heels of Love&quot; with all proceeds from the sales of both the CD and digital versions going to aid Genesis P-Orridge and their battle against leukemia.

Musician Trent Reznor cites P-Orridge as a major inspiration behind his work.

In 2022, writer Christophe Becker published an essay discussing P-Orridge&#x27;s relationship with American writer William S. Burroughs and their influence on his work, &quot;Géométrie de la Souffrance, Genesis P-Orridge + William S. Burroughs&quot;.

<text>The Great Smog of London, or Great Smog of 1952, was a severe air pollution event that affected London, England, in December 1952. A period of unusually cold weather, combined with an anticyclone and windless conditions, collected airborne pollutants—mostly arising from the use of coal—to form a thick layer of smog over the city. It lasted from Friday 5 December to Tuesday 9 December 1952, then dispersed quickly when the weather changed.

The smog caused major disruption by reducing visibility and even penetrating indoor areas, far more severely than previous smog events, called &quot;pea-soupers&quot;. Government medical reports in the weeks following the event estimated that up to 4,000 people had died as a direct result of the smog and 100,000 more were made ill by the smog&#x27;s effects on the human respiratory tract. More recent research suggests that the total number of fatalities was considerably greater, with estimates of between 10,000 and 12,000 deaths.

London&#x27;s poor air quality had been a problem since at least the 13th century. The diarist John Evelyn had written about &quot;the inconveniencie of the aer and smoak of London &quot; in &quot;Fumifugium&quot;, the first book written about air pollution, in 1661. However, the Great Smog was many times worse than anything the city had ever experienced before: it is thought to be the worst air pollution event in the history of the United Kingdom, and the most significant for its effects on environmental research, government regulation, and public awareness of the relationship between air quality and health. It led to several changes in practices and regulations, including the Clean Air Act 1956.

==Background==

===Sources of pollution===

A period of unusually cold weather preceding and during the Great Smog led Londoners to burn much more coal than usual to keep themselves warm. While better-quality &quot;hard&quot; coals (such as anthracite) tended to be exported to pay off World War II debts, post-war domestic coal tended to be of a relatively low-grade, sulphurous variety called &quot;nutty slack&quot; (similar to lignite) which increased the amount of sulphur dioxide in the smoke. There were also numerous coal-fired electric power stations in the Greater London area, including Fulham, Battersea, Bankside, Greenwich, West Ham and Kingston upon Thames, all of which added to the pollution. According to the UK&#x27;s Met Office, the following pollutants were emitted each day during the smoggy period: 1,000 tonnes of smoke particles, 140 tonnes of hydrochloric acid, 14 tonnes of fluorine compounds and 370 tonnes of sulphur dioxide which may have been converted to 800 tonnes of sulphuric acid. The relatively large size of the water droplets in the London fog allowed for the production of sulphates without the acidity of the liquid rising high enough to stop the reaction, and for the resultant dilute acid to become concentrated when the fog was burned away by the sun.

Research suggested that additional pollution-prevention systems fitted at Battersea worsened the air quality. Flue gas washing reduced the temperature of the flue gases so they did not rise, but instead slumped to ground level, causing a local nuisance.

Additionally, there was pollution and smoke from vehicle exhaust, particularly from steam locomotives and diesel-fuelled buses which had replaced the recently abandoned electric tram system. Other industrial and commercial sources also contributed to the air pollution.

On 4 December 1952, an anticyclone settled over a windless London, causing a temperature inversion with relatively cool, stagnant air trapped under a layer of warmer air. The resultant fog, mixed with smoke from home and industrial chimneys, particulates such as those from motor vehicle exhausts, and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, formed a persistent smog, which blanketed the capital the following day. The presence of tarry particles of soot gave the smog its greenish-yellow colour, hence the nickname &quot;pea-souper&quot;. The absence of significant wind prevented its dispersal and allowed an unprecedented accumulation of pollutants.

Although the event is now widely described as the &quot;London&quot; smog, air pollution, in fact, extended far beyond the capital. According to E.T. Wilkins (of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, whose measurements would make clear the connection between smoke, sulphur dioxide, and rising deaths), fog, white mist, or grimy smog covered &quot;many parts of the British Isles&quot;, while &quot;In London and the Thames Valley, fog or smog covered upwards of 1000 square miles&quot;. However, it was in London that the smog&#x27;s effects were the greatest.

==Effects==

===Effect on London===

There was no panic, as London was infamous for its fog. However, this one was denser and longer-lasting than any previous &quot;pea-souper&quot;. Visibility was reduced to a few metres, with one visitor stating that it was &quot;like you were blind&quot;, rendering driving difficult or at times impossible. 

Public transport ceased, apart from the London Underground, and the ambulance service stopped, forcing individuals to transport themselves to hospitals. The smog was so dense that it even seeped indoors, resulting in the cancellation or abandonment of concerts and film screenings, as visibility decreased in large enclosed spaces, and stages and screens became harder to see from the seats. Outdoor sports events were also cancelled.

In the inner London suburbs and away from town centres, there was no disturbance by moving traffic to thin out dense fog in the back streets. As a result, visibility could be down to a metre or so in the daytime. Walking out of doors became a matter of shuffling to feel for potential obstacles such as kerbs. This was made even worse at night since each back street lamp was fitted with an incandescent light bulb, which gave no penetrating light onto the pavement for pedestrians to see their feet or even a lamp post. Fog-penetrating fluorescent lamps did not become widely available until later in the 1950s. &quot;Smog masks&quot; were worn by those who were able to purchase them from chemists.

===Health effects===

In the weeks that ensued, statistics compiled by medical services found that the fog had killed 4,000 people. Many of the victims were very young or elderly, or had pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular problems. In February 1953, Marcus Lipton suggested in the House of Commons that the fog had caused 6,000 deaths and that 25,000 more people had claimed sickness benefits in London during that period.

Mortality remained elevated for months after the fog. A preliminary report, never finalised, blamed those deaths on an influenza epidemic. Emerging evidence revealed that only a fraction of the deaths could be from influenza. E. T. Wilkins, who, as Officer in Charge of Atmospheric Pollution at the government&#x27;s Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was effectively the UK&#x27;s top pollution expert at the time, plotted a chart of elevated death rates for the period from December 1952 to March 1953 and found that there had been an additional 8,000 deaths beyond those initially counted, making 12,000 in total. Most of the deaths were caused by respiratory tract infections, from hypoxia and as a result of mechanical obstruction of the air passages by pus arising from lung infections caused by the smog. The lung infections were mainly bronchopneumonia or acute purulent bronchitis superimposed upon chronic bronchitis.

Research published in 2004 suggests that the number of fatalities was about 12,000, around three to four times greater than the official government total at the time, but very close to the figure Wilkins had originally estimated. In the long term, individuals who were foetuses or infants at the time of the smog ended up having lower intelligence and worse respiratory health than their peers.

===Environmental impact===

Environmental legislation since 1952, such as the City of London (Various Powers) Act 1954 and the Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968, led to a reduction in air pollution. Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as gas fires), or to burn coke instead, which produces minimal smoke. Central heating (using gas, electricity, oil, or permitted solid fuel) was rare in most dwellings at that time, not finding favour until the late 1960s onwards. Despite improvements, insufficient progress had been made to prevent one further smog event ten years later, in early December 1962.

== In media ==
The Great Smog is the central focus of season 1, episode 4 of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;The Crown.&quot; The portrayal of the event was regarded as reasonably accurate by critics, although the political importance and the chaos in the hospitals were thought to have been greatly exaggerated.

An episode of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; entitled &#x27;Forog&#x27;, broadcast on the BBC Home Service 21 December 1954 was a thinly veiled satire on the killer fog crisis. The script by Eric Sykes and Spike Milligan concerned the statues of London&#x27;s monuments, who could get up and move about the city undisturbed only at times when it was enveloped in a characteristic smog. Government-sponsored scientific research sought to dispense with the choking fog, to the annoyance of the statues.

The Great Smog is the setting of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio play &quot;The Creeping Death&quot; and the novel &quot;Amorality Tale&quot;.

The Boris Starling novel &quot;Visibility&quot; is set in the 1952 smog event.

It is the background for E.C.R. Lorac’s 1954 mystery Shroud of Darkness.

The D. E. Stevenson novel &quot;The Tall Stranger&quot; (1957) opens with a dense &quot;fog&quot; that penetrates indoors and endangers hospital patients, in an apparent reference to the 1952 smog event.

In C.J. Sansom’s 2012 alternate reality book &quot;Dominion&quot; a key plot point develops during the event.

Kate Winkler Dawson&#x27;s book &quot;Death in the Air&quot; (2017) interweaves the story of the Great Smog of London with that of serial killer John Christie.

<doc id="294383" wikidata="Q375489" url="?curid=294383" title="Chern–Simons form">
<text>In mathematics, the Chern–Simons forms are certain secondary characteristic classes. The theory is named for Shiing-Shen Chern and James Harris Simons, co-authors of a 1974 paper entitled &quot;Characteristic Forms and Geometric Invariants,&quot; from which the theory arose.

==Definition==
Given a manifold and a Lie algebra valued 1-form formula_1 over it, we can define a family of &quot;p&quot;-forms:

In one dimension, the Chern–Simons 1-form is given by 
:formula_2

In three dimensions, the Chern–Simons 3-form is given by 
:formula_3

In five dimensions, the Chern–Simons 5-form is given by 
:formula_4

where the curvature F is defined as 
:formula_5

The general Chern–Simons form formula_6 is defined in such a way that 
:formula_7

where the wedge product is used to define &quot;Fk&quot;. The right-hand side of this equation is proportional to the &quot;k&quot;-th Chern character of the connection formula_1.

In general, the Chern–Simons &quot;p&quot;-form is defined for any odd &quot;p&quot;.

== Application to physics==
In 1978, Albert Schwarz formulated Chern–Simons theory, early topological quantum field theory, using Chern-Simons forms.

In the gauge theory, the integral of Chern-Simons form is a global geometric invariant, and is typically gauge invariant modulo addition of an integer.

<doc id="294385" wikidata="Q1627281" url="?curid=294385" title="Honoré Jackson">
<text>William Henry Jackson (May 3, 1861 – January 10, 1952), also known as Honoré Jackson or Jaxon, was secretary to Louis Riel during the North-West Rebellion in Canada in 1885. He was married to Aimée, a former teacher in Chicago.

He was born in Toronto, Canada West, to a Methodist family, but several years later his family moved to Wingham, Ontario. Jackson later attended the University of Toronto for three years; however, due to his father&#x27;s bankruptcy, he was unable to complete his last year. In 1881 he moved to Prince Albert in the North-West Territories&#x27; District of Saskatchewan, where he soon began to sympathize with the Métis and their struggle against the Canadian government, though he was not a Métis himself. Jackson became personal secretary to Louis Riel when Riel returned to Canada in 1884, and the two organized a Métis militia and planned a provisional government. Open fighting broke out between the disgruntled Métis and the North-West Mounted Police along with hastily raised militia on March 18 at Duck Lake.

That same day (18 March 1885), Jackson was baptized Catholic by Father Fourmond. Riel stood as godfather for the ceremony and gave him the name &quot;Honoré Joseph Jaxon&quot;. The next day Riel declared the establishment of a provisional government (see Exovedate).

However, Jackson&#x27;s mental health was affected by the religious event, and by the turmoil and excitement of open rebellion, and within days, Riel imprisoned Jackson, perhaps thinking he had gone insane but also fearing that his eccentric religious ideas and his support for Henry George&#x27;s radical philosophical ideas against private ownership of land may cause discord within his (Riel&#x27;s) followers. Later during the rebellion, Riel released Jackson.

He was captured when Canadian government troops overcame the last Métis resistance in the Battle of Batoche ending on May 12, 1885. He was tried for treason, but found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to an insane asylum in Lower Fort Garry, near Winnipeg, Manitoba. He escaped the asylum on November 2 and fled to the United States.

Once there, he changed his name to Honoré Jaxon and joined the labour union movement in Chicago, Illinois, and was active in socialist circles as well. He also decided to lie about his identity and told others he was a Métis. In 1894 he was part of Coxey&#x27;s Army, which marched to Washington, DC, to demand an eight-hour workday. In 1897 he converted to the Baháʼí Faith and oriented his concerns to Canada.

He returned to Canada briefly between 1907 and 1909, spending some of the time interviewing former participants of the Rebellion and addressing labour/socialist meetings. He returned to the United States, eventually moving to New York City. He collected books, newspapers, and pamphlets relating to the Métis people in an attempt to establish in their honour a museum in New York. However, years went by and he slipped into poverty and extreme old age. He was evicted from his apartment on December 12, 1951, and his collection (considered unimportant by the city) was sold as waste paper. He died a month later.

<doc id="294387" wikidata="Q594958" url="?curid=294387" title="Airlock">
<text>An airlock is a room or compartment which permits passage between environments of differing atmospheric pressure or composition, while minimizing the changing of pressure or composition between the differing environments.

An airlock consists of a chamber with two airtight doors or openings, usually arranged in series, which do not open simultaneously. Airlocks can be small-scale mechanisms, such as those used in fermenting, or larger mechanisms, which often take the form of an antechamber.

An airlock may also be used underwater to allow passage between the air environment in a pressure vessel, such as a submarine, and the water environment outside. In such cases the airlock can contain either air or water. This is called a floodable airlock or underwater airlock, and is used to prevent water from entering a submersible vessel or underwater habitat.

== Operation ==
The procedure of entering an airlock from the external or ambient pressure environment, sealing it, equalizing the pressure, and passing through the inner door is known as &quot;locking in&quot;. Conversely, &quot;locking out&quot; involves equalizing pressure, unsealing the outer door, then exiting the lock compartment to enter the ambient environment. &quot;Locking on and off&quot; refer to transfer under pressure where the two chambers are physically connected or disconnected prior to equalizing the pressure and locking in or out.

Before opening either door, the air pressure of the airlock chamber is equalized with that of the environment beyond the next door. A gradual pressure transition minimizes air temperature fluctuations, which helps reduce fogging and condensation, decreases stresses on air seals, and allows safe verification of critical equipment.

When a person who is not in a pressure suit moves between environments of greatly different pressures, an airlock changes the pressure slowly to help with internal air cavity equalization and to prevent decompression sickness. This is critical in underwater diving, and a diver or compressed air worker may have to wait in an airlock for a number of hours in accordance with a decompression schedule. A similar arrangement may be used for access to airtight clean spaces, contaminated spaces, or unbreathable atmospheres, which may not necessarily involve any differences in pressure; in these cases, a decontamination procedure and flushing are used instead of pressure change procedures.

== History and research ==
=== 19th century ===
The first airlock patent was granted in 1830 to Thomas Cochrane, who came up with the idea to help facilitate underground tunnel construction. It was put into use in 1879 during an attempt to dig a tunnel under the Hudson river.

=== 20th century ===
The Apollo program involved developments in airlock technology, as airlocks are critical to allow humans to enter and exit the spacecraft while on the Moon without losing too much air due to its scant atmosphere.

During the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, there was no room that was primarily designed to be an airlock; instead, they used the cabin as an airlock. It had to be evacuated and depressurized before the door was opened, and then once the door was closed it had to be re-pressurized again before anyone could safely reenter the cabin without a space suit.

=== 21st century ===
When the International Space Station (ISS) first began to house humans in November 2000, it did not include an airlock, and all extravehicular activity had to be facilitated by the airlock on the Space Shuttle until the Quest Joint Airlock module was installed in July 2001.

The first ever commercial space airlock was the Nanoracks Bishop Airlock, installed on the ISS in December 2020. It is &quot;bell-shaped&quot; and is designed to transfer payloads out from the ISS interior and into space. it is the largest airlock of its kind on the station, capable of fitting &quot;payloads as large as a refrigerator.&quot;

== Air environments ==
Airlocks are used in air-to-air environments for a variety of reasons, most of which center around either preventing airborne contaminants from entering or exiting an area, or maintaining the air pressure of the interior chamber.

One common use of airlock technology can be found in some cleanrooms, where harmful or otherwise undesired particulates can be excluded by maintaining the room at a higher pressure than the surroundings, alongside other measures. Conversely, particulates are prevented from escaping hazardous environments, such as nuclear reactors, laboratories of biochemistry, and medical centers, by keeping negative room pressure - maintaining the room at a lower pressure than the surroundings, so that air (and any particulates that it carries) cannot escape easily.

A lesser-known application of an airlock is in architecture: inflatable buildings and air-supported structures such as pressurized domes require the internal air pressure to be maintained within a specific range so that the structure doesn&#x27;t collapse. Airlocks are generally the most cost-efficient way to allow people to enter and exit these structures.

Airlocks are utilized to maintain electron microscope interiors at near-vacuum so that air does not affect the electron path. Fermentation locks, such as those used in alcohol brewing, are a type of airlock which allow gases to escape the fermentation vessel while keeping air out. Parachute airlocks are necessary because airfoil collapse due to depressurization can result in dangerous loss of altitude.

Since the 1980s, airlock technology has been used to explore newly detected chambers in the Egyptian pyramids, to prevent the contents from beginning to decompose due to air contamination.

== Underground ==
Civil engineering projects that use air pressure to keep water and mud out of the workplace use an airlock to transfer personnel, equipment, and materials between the external normabaric environment and the pressurized workplace in a caisson or sealed tunnel. The airlock may need to be large enough to accommodate a whole working shift at the same time.

Locking in is usually a quick procedure, taking only a few minutes, while the decompression required for locking out may take hours.

== Underwater ==

Underwater applications include:
* Hyperbaric chambers, to allow entry and exit while maintaining pressure difference between chamber and environment;
* Submarines, closed diving bells, and underwater habitats that are not at ambient pressure, to permit divers to enter and exit. In submarines and underwater habitats they may also be called diver lock-out compartments; and
* Torpedo tubes and escape trunks in submarines.

=== Saturation diving ===

In saturation diving, airlocks are crucial safety elements; they serve as pressurized gateways to safely manage the transfer of divers and support personnel between the saturation system (living quarters) and the diving bell, which shuttles divers to their underwater worksite.

Airlocks in saturation diving are equipped with safety features such as pressure gauges, manual overrides, and interlocks.

Saturation systems typically feature a variety of airlocks, including a stores lock for the transfer of supplies and a medical lock for secure passage of medical necessities or emergency evacuations. Complex &quot;split-level&quot; systems, which house divers at different pressure levels for varied work depths, may necessitate additional airlocks.

Decompression post-dive is a gradual process, often taking a full week. During this time, the airlocks allow divers to shift to a decompression chamber where pressure is progressively reduced back to surface levels. In emergencies, airlocks can facilitate transfer to a hyperbaric escape chamber or lifeboat without significant pressure changes.

=== Hyperbaric treatment chambers ===

In any hyperbaric treatment chamber capable of accommodating more than one person, and where it may be necessary to get a person or equipment into or out of the chamber while it is pressurized, an airlock is used. There will usually be a large airlock at the chamber entry capable of holding one or more persons, and a smaller medical lock for locking in medical supplies and food, and locking out waste.

== Outer space ==

Airlocks are used in outer space, especially during human spaceflight, to maintain the internal habitable environment on spacecraft and space stations when persons are exiting or entering the spacecraft. Without an airlock (or similar technology, such as a suitport) the air inside would be rapidly lost upon opening the door due to the expansive properties of the gases that comprise breathable air, as described by Boyle&#x27;s law. An airlock room is needed to decompress astronauts after they suit up in specialized space suits in preparation for extravehicular activity, and then to recompress them upon return. Airlocks such as the Nanoracks Bishop Airlock also allow payloads to be released into space with minimal air loss.
The Skylab orbital workshop included a manually operated trash disposal airlock to transfer trash from the pressurized habitable compartment to the unpressurized waste tank.

Other examples of airlocks used in space include the Quest Joint Airlock and the airlock on Kibō (ISS module).

<text>In mathematics, a binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result. It is a fundamental property of many binary operations, and many mathematical proofs depend on it. Perhaps most familiar as a property of arithmetic, e.g. or , the property can also be used in more advanced settings. The name is needed because there are operations, such as division and subtraction, that do not have it (for example, ); such operations are &quot;not&quot; commutative, and so are referred to as &quot;noncommutative operations&quot;. The idea that simple operations, such as the multiplication and addition of numbers, are commutative was for many years implicitly assumed. Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, when mathematics started to become formalized. A similar property exists for binary relations; a binary relation is said to be symmetric if the relation applies regardless of the order of its operands; for example, equality is symmetric as two equal mathematical objects are equal regardless of their order.

== Mathematical definitions ==
A binary operation formula_1 on a set &quot;S&quot; is called &quot;commutative&quot; if
formula_2 
In other words, an operation is commutative if every two elements commute. An operation that does not satisfy the above property is called &quot;noncommutative&quot;.

One says that &quot;commutes&quot; with or that and &quot;commute&quot; under formula_1 if
formula_4
That is, a specific pair of elements may commute even if the operation is (strictly) noncommutative.

== Examples ==
=== Commutative operations ===

* Addition and multiplication are commutative in most number systems, and, in particular, between natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers. This is also true in every field.
* Addition is commutative in every vector space and in every algebra.
* Union and intersection are commutative operations on sets.
* &quot;And&quot; and &quot;or&quot; are commutative logical operations.

=== Noncommutative operations ===
==== Division, subtraction, and exponentiation ====

Division is noncommutative, since formula_5.

Subtraction is noncommutative, since formula_6. However it is classified more precisely as anti-commutative, since formula_7.

Exponentiation is noncommutative, since formula_8. This property leads to two different &quot;inverse&quot; operations of exponentiation (namely, the &quot;n&quot;th-root operation and the logarithm operation), whereas multiplication only has one inverse operation.

==== Truth functions ====

Some truth functions are noncommutative, since the truth tables for the functions are different when one changes the order of the operands. For example, the truth tables for and are

==== Function composition of linear functions ====
Function composition of linear functions from the real numbers to the real numbers is almost always noncommutative. For example, let formula_9 and formula_10. Then
formula_11
and
formula_12
This also applies more generally for linear and affine transformations from a vector space to itself (see below for the Matrix representation).

==== Matrix multiplication ====

Matrix multiplication of square matrices is almost always noncommutative, for example:
formula_13

==== Vector product ====

The vector product (or cross product) of two vectors in three dimensions is anti-commutative; i.e., &quot;b&quot; × &quot;a&quot; = −(&quot;a&quot; × &quot;b&quot;).

== History and etymology ==
Records of the implicit use of the commutative property go back to ancient times. The Egyptians used the commutative property of multiplication to simplify computing products. Euclid is known to have assumed the commutative property of multiplication in his book &quot;Elements&quot;. Formal uses of the commutative property arose in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when mathematicians began to work on a theory of functions. Today the commutative property is a well-known and basic property used in most branches of mathematics.

The first recorded use of the term &quot;commutative&quot; was in a memoir by François Servois in 1814, which used the word &quot;commutatives&quot; when describing functions that have what is now called the commutative property. &quot;Commutative&quot; is the feminine form of the French adjective &quot;commutatif&quot;, which is derived from the French noun &quot;commutation&quot; and the French verb &quot;commuter&quot;, meaning &quot;to exchange&quot; or &quot;to switch&quot;, a cognate of &quot;to commute&quot;. The term then appeared in English in 1838. in Duncan Gregory&#x27;s article entitled &quot;On the real nature of symbolical algebra&quot; published in 1840 in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

== Propositional logic ==
=== Rule of replacement ===
In truth-functional propositional logic, &quot;commutation&quot;, or &quot;commutativity&quot; refer to two valid rules of replacement. The rules allow one to transpose propositional variables within logical expressions in logical proofs. The rules are:
formula_14
and 
formula_15
where &quot;formula_16&quot; is a metalogical symbol representing &quot;can be replaced in a proof with&quot;.

=== Truth functional connectives ===

&quot;Commutativity&quot; is a property of some logical connectives of truth functional propositional logic. The following logical equivalences demonstrate that commutativity is a property of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional tautologies.

;Commutativity of conjunction: formula_17
;Commutativity of disjunction: formula_18
;Commutativity of implication (also called the law of permutation): formula_19
;Commutativity of equivalence (also called the complete commutative law of equivalence): formula_20

== Set theory ==
In group and set theory, many algebraic structures are called commutative when certain operands satisfy the commutative property. In higher branches of mathematics, such as analysis and linear algebra the commutativity of well-known operations (such as addition and multiplication on real and complex numbers) is often used (or implicitly assumed) in proofs.

== Mathematical structures and commutativity ==
* A commutative semigroup is a set endowed with a total, associative and commutative operation.
* If the operation additionally has an identity element, we have a commutative monoid
* An abelian group, or &quot;commutative group&quot; is a group whose group operation is commutative.
* A commutative ring is a ring whose multiplication is commutative. (Addition in a ring is always commutative.)
* In a field both addition and multiplication are commutative.

== Related properties ==

=== Associativity ===
The associative property is closely related to the commutative property. The associative property of an expression containing two or more occurrences of the same operator states that the order operations are performed in does not affect the final result, as long as the order of terms does not change. In contrast, the commutative property states that the order of the terms does not affect the final result.

Most commutative operations encountered in practice are also associative. However, commutativity does not imply associativity. A counterexample is the function
formula_21
which is clearly commutative (interchanging &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; does not affect the result), but it is not associative (since, for example, formula_22 but formula_23). More such examples may be found in commutative non-associative magmas. Furthermore, associativity does not imply commutativity either – for example multiplication of quaternions or of matrices is always associative but not always commutative.

=== Distributivity ===
=== Symmetry ===

Some forms of symmetry can be directly linked to commutativity. When a commutative operation is written as a binary function formula_24 then this function is called a symmetric function, and its graph in three-dimensional space is symmetric across the plane formula_25. For example, if the function is defined as formula_26 then formula_27 is a symmetric function.

For relations, a symmetric relation is analogous to a commutative operation, in that if a relation &quot;R&quot; is symmetric, then formula_28.

== Non-commuting operators in quantum mechanics ==
In quantum mechanics as formulated by Schrödinger, physical variables are represented by linear operators such as formula_29 (meaning multiply by formula_29), and formula_31. These two operators do not commute as may be seen by considering the effect of their compositions formula_32 and formula_33 (also called products of operators) on a one-dimensional wave function formula_34:
formula_35

According to the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg, if the two operators representing a pair of variables do not commute, then that pair of variables are mutually complementary, which means they cannot be simultaneously measured or known precisely. For example, the position and the linear momentum in the formula_29-direction of a particle are represented by the operators formula_29 and formula_38, respectively (where formula_39 is the reduced Planck constant). This is the same example except for the constant formula_40, so again the operators do not commute and the physical meaning is that the position and linear momentum in a given direction are complementary.

<text>The Baschet Brothers were two French artists named François Baschet (born 30 March 1920, in Paris; died 11 February 2014) and Bernard Baschet (born 24 August 1917, Paris; died 17 July 2015) who collaborated on creating sound sculptures and inventing musical instruments, such as the &quot;Cristal Baschet&quot;. François Baschet was a sculptor and Bernard Baschet an engineer. The Baschet Brothers invented the inflatable guitar, the aluminum piano and many other experimental musical instruments. They created an &quot;Baschet Educational Instrumentarium&quot; for exposing young people to musical concepts. 

The Baschet&#x27;s research started in the 1950s artistic turmoil, soon turning the two brothers into the pioneers of sound sculpture, in addition to making them highly requested by musicians, composers, experimental directors.

The quest for new sounds led the Baschet brothers to combine new materials of the time, usually through folding metal sheets into geometric shapes.
Their sculptures range from small folded sheet metal of a few centimeters up to structures several meters high with loud, impressive and complex sounds.
Their exhibitions were shown in prestigious museums throughout the world – the United States, Japan, Germany – as well as in small villages in France, always with the aim of making art accessible to all.

The work of the Baschet brothers of making sound art accessible to all continues through the official association, established in 1982: the Baschet Sound Structures Association (originally &quot;Structures sonores et pédagogie&quot;, it changed its name in 2012). The association has the support of the Baschet family and has an exclusive licence for creating some of the Baschet reproductible works.

==Works==
===Instruments===
The Cristal baschet is a type of musical instrument designed by the Baschet brothers in the 1950s, the Cristal Baschet is played with wet fingers on glass rods.
Its continuous, enchanting sounds have inspired many artists and composers.
The current Cristal Baschet models produce a variety of sounds and can also be used in percussion. They can be fitted with numerous resonators including &quot;moustaches&quot; and different types of diffusers: cones and metal sheets.

The Rotating Whistler (“Le Sifflant Tournant”, created in 1962, produces the sharpest and longest sounds of all the Baschet Sound Structures. Turning the keyboard produces an unusual sound effect which does not need an amplifier cone.

Created in 1967, the Polytonal Percussion (“La Percussion Polytimbre”) includes large, straight rods that create deep, resonant sounds. The keyboard is organized with different percussive devices and cones diffuse the sound.

The Voice Leaf (“La Tôle à Voix”) was created in 1965 to mimic the Indian Tanpura, the metal sheets serve as resonators which transform the human voice when vibrated.

===Public monuments===
The Baschet brothers also created several public monuments such as clocks, fountains, bell towers and chimes – some ephemeral, some still in existence.
One of the first fountains created was made for the World&#x27;s Fair, in San Antonio Texas in 1968.

They made others in the early 1970s, including in Cologne, New York, Mexico City, London and Barcelona.

Subsequently, they worked on bell towers and clocks. The Baschet &quot;signal sonore&quot;(or school bell) of the Blaise Pascal school is in the process of being restored in Saint-Michel-sur-Orge – the town where Bernard Baschet&#x27;s studio has been since 1970.

===The Baschet Educational Instrumentarium===
Invented in the 1980s, the Baschet Educational Instrumentarium consists of 14 sound structures which make a &quot;sound palette&quot; of around 100 different tones.
Its purpose is to initiate children, adults and people with disabilities in collective musical discovery through games and experimentation, and without any previous musical knowledge.

Based on the large, original Baschet sound structures, the Baschet Educational Instrumentarium creates a broad spectrum of sounds, including those not in the classical European repertoire, as well as some which resemble electroacoustic sounds.

Education in sound culture is stimulated through listening to sounds, to oneself and to others. The experience of sound is not only through listening, it is also through hands-on learning and musical improvisation.

This Instrumentarium is also used in concert by musicians. There are approximately 500 Baschet Educational Instrumentariums in existence, in France and around the world.

==Career==
François had wanted to be an artist, but his father warned him against pursuing the unstable life of an artist. He decided to study business in college, but felt no passion for it. After World War II, which had interrupted his education, he decided to travel around the world. He brought with him on his trip a guitar to help him earn a living, but wanting something more portable he invented an inflatable guitar using a balloon and a collapsible wood neck. He continued to perform with this guitar upon his return to Paris. Soon he and his brother, who had studied engineering, began collaborating on sculptural musical instruments.

Beginning in 1952, the Baschets started research into all existing musical instruments and put this knowledge to work in creating dozens of &quot;structures sonores&quot; (i.e., &#x27;sonorous sculptures&#x27;). Their visually striking instruments were crafted out of steel and aluminum and amplified by large curved conical sheets of metal, and are most often easy to play and accessible to people with any level of experience. One example of this is the Hemisfair Musical Fountain, which consists of an array of posts at the top of which are groups of conical sound diffusers, and above them circles of metal prongs. These are played by jets of water aimed by observers.

In 1954, the brothers met Jacques and Yvonne Lasry. Jacques was a pianist and composer and Yvonne was an organist. The four formed an association which they called &quot;Lasry-Baschet Sound Structures.&quot; They held their first concerts in 1955. The group was successful and in 1960 were asked by Jean Cocteau to provide music for his film, &quot;Le Testament d&#x27;Orphée&quot;. The group toured, appearing on television shows including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. In 1966 they were invited to hold an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art and director Alfred Barr purchased a sculpture for the museum&#x27;s collection. Their tune &quot;Manège&quot; was also used as theme for the Granada TV program &quot;Picture Box&quot;, which ran in the United Kingdom from 1966 to 1990.

In the 1960s the Lasrys emigrated to Israel. In 1977 Bernard met Michel Deneuve, a musician, who joined them, starting a new association, and assisted in creating instruments. Deneuve was especially dedicated to working on their instrument called the &quot;Cristal&quot;.

<text>Code Co-op is the peer-to-peer revision control system made by Reliable Software.

==Distinguishing features==
Code Co-op is a distributed revision control system of the replicated type.

It uses peer-to-peer architecture to share projects among developers and to control changes to files. Instead of using a centralized database (the repository), it replicates its own database on each computer involved in the project.

The replicas are synchronized by the exchange of (differential) &quot;scripts&quot;. The exchange of scripts may proceed using different transports, including e-mail (support for SMTP and POP3, integration with MAPI clients, Gmail) and LAN.

Code Co-op has a built-in peer-to-peer wiki system, which can be used to integrate documentation with a software project. It is also possible to create text-based Wiki databases, which can be queried using simplified SQL directly from wiki pages.

==Standard features==
#Distributed development support through E-mail, LAN, or VPN
#Change-based model—modifications to multiple files are checked in as one transaction
#File additions, deletions, renames, and moves are treated on the same level as edits—they can be added in any combination to a check-in changeset
#File changes can be reviewed before a check-in using a built-in or user-defined differ
#Synchronization changes can be reviewed in the same manner by the recipients
#Three-way visual merge
#Project history is replicated on each machine. Historical version can be reviewed, compared, or restored
#Integration with Microsoft SCC clients, including Visual Studio

==History==
Code Co-op was one of the first distributed version control systems. It debuted at the 7th Workshop on System Configuration Management in May 1997.

The development of Code Co-op started in 1996, when Reliable Software, the distributed software company that makes it, was established. Reliable Software needed a collaboration tool that would work between the United States and Poland. The only dependable and affordable means of communication between the two countries was e-mail, hence the idea of using e-mail for the exchange of diffs. Of course, with such slow transport, using a centralized repository was infeasible. Each user of Code Co-op had to have a full replica of the repository, including the history of changes.

The problem was reduced to that of designing a distributed database that uses slow and unreliable transport for synchronization (later, faster LAN transport was also added). It also followed that the synchronization between multiple sites must use some kind of peer-to-peer protocol.

In 2018, the C++ source code for Code Co-op was released under the MIT License.

==Theoretical foundations==
Code Co-op is an example of a distributed database. Local repositories are considered the replicas of this virtual database. Each check-in corresponds to a distributed commit—a non-blocking version of a two-phase commit.

<text>MacWrite is a discontinued WYSIWYG word processor released along with the first Apple Macintosh systems in 1984. Together with MacPaint, it was one of the two original &quot;killer applications&quot; that propelled the adoption and popularity of the GUI in general, and the Mac in particular.

MacWrite was spun off to Claris, which released a major update in 1989 as MacWrite II. A further series of improvements produced 1993&#x27;s MacWrite Pro, but further improvements were few and far between. By the mid-1990s, MacWrite was no longer a serious contender in the word processing market, development ended around 1995, and it was completely discontinued in 1998 due to dwindling sales.

== History ==

===Development===
When the Mac was first being created, it was clear that users would interact with it differently from other personal computers. Typical computers of the era booted into text-only disk operating system or BASIC environments, requiring the users to type in commands. Some of these programs may have presented a graphical user interface of their own, but on the Mac, users would instead be expected to stay in the standard GUI both for launching and running programs. Having an approachable, consistent GUI was an advantage for the Mac platform, but unlike prior personal computers, the Mac was sold with no programming language built-in.

This presented a problem to Apple: the Mac was planned to be launched in 1983, with a new user interface paradigm, but no third-party software would be available for it, nor could users easily write their own. Users would end up with a computer that did nothing. In order to fill this void, several members of the Mac team took it upon themselves to write simple applications to fill these roles until third-party developers published more full-fledged software. The result was MacWrite and MacPaint, which shipped free with every Macintosh from 1984 to 1986.

The MacWrite development team was a company called Encore Systems, founded and led by Randy Wigginton, one of Apple&#x27;s earliest employees, and included Don Breuner and Ed Ruder (co-founders of Encore Systems and also early Apple employees; Gabreal Franklin later joined Encore Systems as President.) Wigginton, who had left Apple in 1981, maintained a relationship with many Apple employees, many of whom were on the Macintosh development team. He agreed to lead the MacWrite development team on a semi-official basis. Before it was released, MacWrite was known as &quot;Macintosh WP&quot; (Word Processor) and &quot;MacAuthor&quot;. Allegedly, Steve Jobs was not convinced of his team&#x27;s abilities, and secretly commissioned another project just to be sure; its development was eventually released as WriteNow.

===Early versions===
The first versions of MacWrite were rather limited, supporting only the most basic editing features and able to handle just a few pages of text before running into performance problems. (Early versions of MacWrite held the entire document in memory, and early versions of the Macintosh had relatively little free memory.) Nevertheless, it increased user expectations of a word processing program. MacWrite established the conventions for a GUI-based word processor, with such features as a toolbar for selecting paragraph formatting options, font and style menus, and a ruler for tabs, margins, and indents. Similar word processors followed, including the first GUI version of Microsoft Word and WriteNow, which addressed many of MacWrite&#x27;s limitations while adhering to much the same user interface.

The original Mac could print to a dot matrix printer called the ImageWriter, but quality was only adequate. The later LaserWriter laser printer allowed dramatically better output, at a price. However, the possibilities of the GUI/MacWrite/LaserWriter combination were obvious and this, in turn, spurred the development of desktop publishing, which became the &quot;killer app&quot; for the Mac and GUIs in general.

MacWrite&#x27;s inclusion with the Macintosh discouraged developers from creating other word processing software for the computer. Apple unbundled the software with the introduction of the Macintosh Plus, requiring customers to purchase it for the first time. Strong sales continued, and Apple eventually let MacWrite and MacPaint languish with no development resources assigned to improving them.

Unfortunately this plan backfired. Users flooded Apple with complaints, demanding newer versions that would keep pace with new features in the Mac, while at the same time developers flooded Apple with complaints about there being any &quot;possibility&quot; of an upgrade. Apple finally decided the only solution was to spin off the products as a separate company, Claris.

===MacWrite II===
Claris formed in 1987 and re-released the existing versions of the Apple products under their own name. Initially it seemed Claris was as uninterested in developing MacWrite as Apple had been. Several minor upgrades were released to allow MacWrite to run on newer versions of the classic Mac OS, but few other problems were addressed.

Things changed in the later 1980s with the introduction of MacWrite II. The main changes for this release were an updated user interface, a number of new &quot;style&quot; capabilities, and the inclusion of Claris&#x27; file translator technology, XTND. MacWrite II was the first really new version of the software, and was based on a word processing engine purchased from Quark, Inc.

By 1989 Word already dominated the Mac with about 60% market share, but the introduction of MacWrite II changed things dramatically; by 1990 Word had dropped to about 45% of the market, and MacWrite had risen to about 30%. This seemed to demonstrate that it would be worth developing further, but Claris did not respond quickly with updated versions.

Microsoft, on the other hand, did, and soon introduced Word 4.0. MacWrite&#x27;s share once again started to erode.

===MacWrite Pro===
In the late 1980s, Claris started a massive upgrade series to produce the &quot;Pro&quot; line of products. The main change would be to integrate all of their products with a consistent GUI based on that of FileMaker. This included a common toolbar running down the left side of the screen, and a number of standardized tool palettes. In addition, the Pro series also used common international spelling dictionaries and a thesaurus. The result was a suite of products that all look and work the same way, and are able to read and write each other&#x27;s formats.

The resulting MacWrite Pro, released in early 1993, was a major upgrade from previous versions. Reviewers almost universally praised the new release as offering all the required tools while still being very easy to use. However, development had been slow; one developer claimed it was primarily due to extremely demanding quality assurance requirements. By the time MacWrite Pro was released, Word completely dominated the word processor market. Pro did little to address MacWrite&#x27;s rapidly dwindling market share, which briefly stabilized at about 5% of the market before starting to slide again. Sales were apparently dismal, and it was one of the first products Claris abandoned in the mid-1990s.

The word-processing module of AppleWorks was very similar to MacWrite Pro. While it was written entirely from scratch, it retained some of the design limitations of MacWrite Pro. However, later versions of AppleWorks are unable to read older MacWrite Pro files.

==Reception==
In a survey of five Macintosh word processors, &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Apple Applications&quot; in 1987 wrote that &quot;once a bold pioneer, &quot;MacWrite&quot; now seems frozen in time ... it lags behind other word processors in power and responsiveness, and it&#x27;s clearly unsuited for outlining, layout, and other advanced tasks&quot;.

<text>William Thomas Strayhorn (November 29, 1915 – May 31, 1967) was an American jazz composer, pianist, lyricist, and arranger who collaborated with bandleader and composer Duke Ellington for nearly three decades. His compositions include &quot;Take the &#x27;A&#x27; Train&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Bridge&quot;, &quot;A Flower Is a Lovesome Thing&quot;, and &quot;Lush Life&quot;.

==Early life==
Strayhorn was born in Dayton, Ohio, United States. His family then moved to the Homewood neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His mother&#x27;s family came from Hillsborough, North Carolina, and she sent him there to protect him from his father&#x27;s drunken rages. Strayhorn spent many months of his childhood at his grandparents&#x27; house in Hillsborough. In an interview, Strayhorn said that his grandmother was his primary influence during the first ten years of his life. He became interested in music while living with her, playing hymns on her piano and listening to records on her Victrola record player.

==Return to Pittsburgh and meeting Ellington==
Strayhorn returned to Pittsburgh while still in grade school. He worked odd jobs to earn enough money to buy his first piano, and took lessons from Charlotte Enty Catlin. He attended Westinghouse High School, later also attended by jazz pianists Erroll Garner and Ahmad Jamal. He played in the school band, and studied under Carl McVicker, who had also instructed Erroll Garner and Mary Lou Williams. He studied classical music for a time at the Pittsburgh Music Institute, writing a musical, forming a trio that played daily on a local radio station, and writing/composing the songs &quot;Life Is Lonely&quot; (later renamed &quot;Lush Life&quot;), &quot;My Little Brown Book&quot;, and &quot;Something to Live For&quot;. By age 19, he was writing for a professional musical, &quot;Fantastic Rhythm&quot;.

Strayhorn&#x27;s original ambition to become a classical composer was foiled by the harsh reality of a black man trying to make it in the classical world, which at that time was almost completely dominated by white people. Strayhorn was introduced to the music of pianists like Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson at age 19. The artistic influence of these musicians guided him into the realm of jazz where he remained for the rest of his life. His first jazz exposure was in a combo called the Mad Hatters that played around Pittsburgh. Strayhorn&#x27;s fellow students, guitarist Bill Esch and drummer Mickey Scrima, also influenced his transition to jazz, and he began writing arrangements for Buddy Malone&#x27;s Pittsburgh dance band after 1937.

Strayhorn saw Duke Ellington play in Pittsburgh in 1933, then met him in December 1938 after Ellington performed there again. He first explained, and then showed the bandleader how he would have arranged one of Ellington&#x27;s own pieces. Ellington was impressed enough to invite other band members to hear Strayhorn. At the end of the visit, he arranged for Strayhorn to meet him when the band returned to New York. Strayhorn worked for Ellington for the next 25 years as an arranger, composer, occasional pianist and collaborator until his death from cancer. As Ellington described him, &quot;Billy Strayhorn was my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine.&quot;

==Working with Ellington==

Strayhorn was a gifted composer and arranger who seemed to flourish in Duke&#x27;s shadow. Ellington was arguably a father figure and the band was affectionately protective of the diminutive and mild-mannered Strayhorn, nicknamed by the band &quot;Strays&quot;, &quot;Weely&quot;, and &quot;Swee&#x27; Pea&quot;. Ellington used Strayhorn to complete his thoughts and introduce new musical ideas (and sometimes it worked the other way around), while giving him the freedom to write on his own and enjoy at least some credit. Though Duke Ellington took credit for much of Strayhorn&#x27;s work, he did not maliciously drown out his partner. Ellington would make jokes onstage like, &quot;Strayhorn does a lot of the work but I get to take the bows!&quot; On the other hand, Ellington did not oppose his publicists frequently crediting him without any mention of Strayhorn, and, despite the latter&#x27;s attempts to hide his dissatisfaction, &quot;Strayhorn revealed&quot;, at least to his friends, &quot;a deepening well of unease about his lack of public recognition as Ellington&#x27;s prominence grew.&quot;

Strayhorn composed the Duke Ellington orchestra&#x27;s signature song, &quot;Take the &#x27;A&#x27; Train&quot;, and a number of other pieces that became part of the band&#x27;s repertoire. In some cases Strayhorn received attribution for his work such as &quot;Lotus Blossom&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Bridge&quot;, and &quot;Rain Check&quot;, while others, such as &quot;Day Dream&quot; and &quot;Something to Live For&quot;, were listed as collaborations with Ellington or, in the case of &quot;Satin Doll&quot; and &quot;Sugar Hill Penthouse&quot;, were credited to Ellington alone. Strayhorn also arranged many of Ellington&#x27;s band-within-a-band recordings and provided harmonic clarity and polish to Duke&#x27;s compositions. Ellington gave Strayhorn full credit as his collaborator on later, larger works such as &quot;Such Sweet Thunder&quot;, &quot;A Drum Is a Woman&quot;, &quot;The Perfume Suite,&quot; and &quot;Far East Suite&quot;, where Strayhorn and Ellington worked closely together. Strayhorn often played the piano with the Ellington orchestra, both live and in the studio.

&quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; music critic Mark Stryker concludes that the work of Strayhorn and Ellington in the score of the 1959 Hollywood film &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; is &quot;indispensable, [although] ... too sketchy to rank in the top echelon among Ellington-Strayhorn masterpiece suites like &quot;Such Sweet Thunder&quot; and &quot;Far East Suite&quot;, but its most inspired moments are their equal.&quot; Film historians have recognized the soundtrack &quot;as a landmark—the first significant Hollywood film music by African Americans comprising non-diegetic music, that is, music whose source is not visible or implied by action in the film, like an on-screen band.&quot; The score &quot;avoided the cultural stereotypes that previously characterized jazz scores and rejected a strict adherence to visuals in ways that presaged the New Wave cinema of the &#x27;60s.&quot;
In 1960, the two collaborated on arrangements for the album &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot;, recorded for Columbia Records and featuring jazz interpretations of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; by Tchaikovsky. The original album cover is notable for the inclusion of Strayhorn&#x27;s name and picture along with Ellington&#x27;s on the front.

==Personal life==
Shortly before going on his second European tour with his orchestra, from March to May 1939, Ellington announced to his sister Ruth and son Mercer Ellington that Strayhorn &quot;is staying with us.&quot; Through Mercer, Strayhorn met his first partner, African-American musician Aaron Bridgers, with whom Strayhorn lived until Bridgers moved to Paris in 1947.

As an adult, Strayhorn was openly gay to his friends and the members of the Ellington band. He participated in the civil rights movement, and as a friend to Martin Luther King Jr., he arranged and conducted &quot;King Fit the Battle of Alabam&#x27;&quot; for the Ellington orchestra in 1963 for the historical revue (and album) &quot;My People&quot;, dedicated to King.

Strayhorn had a major influence on the career of Lena Horne, who wanted to marry Strayhorn and considered him the love of her life. Strayhorn used his classical background to improve Horne&#x27;s singing technique, and they recorded songs together. In the 1950s, Strayhorn left Duke Ellington for a few years to pursue a solo career of his own. He released a few solo albums and revues for the Original Copasetics and took on theater productions with his friend Luther Henderson.

==Illness and death==
In 1964, Strayhorn was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which took his life in the early morning of May 31, 1967, when he was with his partner, Bill Grove, not in Lena Horne&#x27;s arms as has often been falsely reported. By her own account, she was touring in Europe when she received the news of Strayhorn&#x27;s death. His ashes were scattered in the Hudson River by a gathering of his closest friends.

While in the hospital, he submitted his final composition to Ellington; &quot;Blood Count&quot; was used as the third track in Ellington&#x27;s memorial album for Strayhorn, &quot;...And His Mother Called Him Bill&quot;, which was recorded several months after Strayhorn&#x27;s death. The last track of the album is a solo version of &quot;Lotus Blossom&quot; performed by Ellington, who sat at the piano and played it while the band (who can be heard in the background) were packing up after the formal end of the recording session.

==Legacy==
A Pennsylvania state historical marker highlighting Strayhorn&#x27;s accomplishments was placed at Westinghouse High School in Pittsburgh, from which he graduated. In North Carolina, a highway historical marker honoring Strayhorn is located in downtown Hillsborough, near his childhood home. Strayhorn is also memorialized in a mural in Downtown Hillsborough.

The former Regent Theatre in Pittsburgh&#x27;s East Liberty neighborhood was renamed the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater in honor of Strayhorn and fellow Pittsburgh resident Gene Kelly in 2000. It is a community-based performing arts theater.

In 2015, Strayhorn was inducted into the Legacy Walk.

In his autobiography and in a spoken word passage in his &quot;Second Sacred Concert&quot;, Ellington listed what he considered Strayhorn&#x27;s &quot;four major moral freedoms&quot;: &quot;freedom from hate, unconditionally; freedom from self-pity (even through all the pain and bad news); freedom from fear of possibly doing something that might possibly help another more than it might himself and freedom from the kind of pride that might make a man think that he was better than his brother or his neighbor.&quot;

<text>The ImageWriter is a product line of dot matrix printers formerly manufactured by Apple Computer, Inc., and designed then to be compatible with their entire line of computers. There were three different models introduced over time, which were popular among Apple II and Mac owners.

==Original ImageWriter==
The first ImageWriter is a serial-based dot matrix printer introduced by Apple Computer in late 1983.

The printer was essentially a re-packaged 9-pin dot matrix printer from C. Itoh Electronics (model C. Itoh 8510, with a modified ROM and pinout), released the same year. It was introduced as a replacement for the earlier parallel-based Apple Dot Matrix Printer/DMP (also a C. Itoh model) and, while primarily intended for the Apple II, worked across Apple&#x27;s entire computer product line. The ImageWriter could produce images as well as text, up to a resolution of 144 DPI and a speed of about 120 CPS (characters per second). In text mode, the printer was logic-seeking, meaning it would print with the head moving in both directions while it would print only in one direction for graphics and Near Letter Quality. The ImageWriter was also supported by the original Macintosh computer, the Macintosh 128K. Apple wanted a graphical printer for the Mac, and had introduced the ImageWriter primarily to support the new machine. This permitted it to produce WYSIWYG output from the screen of the computer, which was an important aspect for promoting the concept of the GUI and, later, desktop publishing. The ImageWriter could be supported by Microsoft Windows-based PC&#x27;s by using the included C. Itoh 8510 compatible driver.

The ImageWriter was succeeded by the ImageWriter II in late 1985.

A wider version of the ImageWriter, sold as ImageWriter 15&quot;, was introduced in January 1984. It allowed printing to 12&quot; wide as well as to 15&quot; wide paper. This version of ImageWriter remained in production for more than a year after the ImageWriter II was introduced. Production was eventually discontinued in January 1987.

===Accessories===
In 1984 Thunderware introduced the ThunderScan, an optical scanner that was installed in place of the ImageWriter ribbon cartridge. With support for the Apple II and the Mac, the ThunderScan provided low cost grayscale scanning with moderate resolution and speed.

==ImageWriter II==
The ImageWriter II is a serial based dot matrix printer that was manufactured by Apple Computer, which supported its entire computer product line when it was released in September 1985. It had several optional add-ons available, including: a plug-in network card, buffer memory card, and motorized sheet feeder. It also supported color printing with an appropriate ribbon. The codename for the ImageWriter II was &quot;Express&quot;

&quot;Compute!&quot; reported in 1989 that many believed that the ImageWriter II was inferior to its predecessor. The magazine stated that the first ImageWriter was sturdier, handled paper better, and had better print in most cases.

=== Features ===
The ImageWriter II, like its predecessor, used a 9-pin C. Itoh mechanism. However, the ImageWriter II was significantly faster in draft mode, where it could print 250 characters per second. Color images and text could be produced by using a color ribbon, and eight colors were supported by the original version of QuickDraw on the Mac despite running on a monochrome platform. On the Apple II, complex full-color graphics could be printed. Used with the appropriate software, the ImageWriter II could produce color images with potentially hundreds of simulated colors through dithering.

The ImageWriter II has three ASCII text-quality modes:
#&quot;NLQ&quot; (near-letter-quality) at 45 CPS, a feature for very high text quality on the Apple II platform or for improved draft printing quality on the Macintosh platform. 
#&quot;Standard&quot; (Correspondence) mode at 180 CPS, providing average-quality text.
#&quot;Draft&quot; mode at 250 CPS, the fastest output but at the lowest quality level.

In addition to having the same ASCII and European-language characters found in the original ImageWriter, the ImageWriter II added 32 MouseText characters.

The ImageWriter II was designed in accordance with Apple&#x27;s Snow White design language. In 1986, it received the I.D. Design Review and Silver International Design Excellence Awards, making it the first desktop printer to receive such approbation.

=== Add-on accessories ===

The printer had an expansion socket under the front cover which could accommodate either Apple&#x27;s AppleTalk network card or 32K memory buffer card, but not both at the same time. Sequential Systems produced a 2-in-1 solution card that combined both features into one card, as well as larger memory buffer cards up to 1 MB. With an optional AppleTalk networking card installed, it was a low-cost alternative to the vastly more expensive LaserWriter. Another third-party innovation was an add-on peripheral called the ThunderScan, which allowed the printer to work as a low-cost optical scanner (in which the scanner mechanism temporarily replaced the ink ribbon cartridge).

The ImageWriter II also supported an optional motorized sheet feeder that could feed cut-sheet paper.

=== Revisions ===

* The original Imagewriter II (1985) closely followed Apple&#x27;s Snow white design introduced with the Apple IIc, and was one of the few peripherals that matched its creamy off-white color scheme known at Apple as Fog. This model is recognizable for being white in color and not having the product name on the front cover. There were many ROM revisions produced for this and later ImageWriter IIs, made visible through a self-test (pressing the form feed button while turning the ImageWriter on, then releasing both buttons simultaneously; the printer would then print the ROM version as well as dipswitch settings). The printer came with a small built-in 2K RAM memory buffer, with option to expand.
* The second ImageWriter II (1986) changed to the standard warm-grey Apple &quot;Platinum&quot; color. This model is not only recognizable for being light grey in color, but for having the product name printed beside the rainbow Apple logo. It was introduced at roughly the same time as the Apple IIGS in late 1986, to match its then-new Platinum color scheme which was later adopted by all other computers at Apple.
* The third revision, the ImageWriter II/L (1990) as it was known internally, offered some slight design improvements. The internal power source changed to a switching power supply, reducing the overall weight of the printer by 10 pounds. As a result of the change, power and serial interface ports were moved from the legs to either ends of the tractor-feed housing. This model also increased the built-in buffer memory to 24K RAM, eliminating the need for the memory-expansion option. The expansion socket was still present for supporting an optional AppleTalk network card.

The ImageWriter II was compatible with Microsoft Windows-based computers using the operating systems&#x27; included C-Itoh 8510 driver, while color support was available through third-party drivers. The only requirement was an available serial port and appropriate interface cable.

Despite the introduction of the inkjet StyleWriter in 1991, the ImageWriter II kept selling. It continued in production until late 1996, making it the longest-running Apple product in history.

===In popular culture===
On the 2000 album &quot;A Spectrum of Infinite Scale&quot;, surf-rock band Man or Astro-man? included the song &quot;A Simple Text File&quot;. The song is a recording of the sound of an ImageWriter II printing a carefully crafted file.

An ImageWriter can also be seen the music video for Marilyn Manson&#x27;s &quot;The Dope Show.&quot;

== ImageWriter LQ ==
ImageWriter LQ (Letter Quality) is a 27-pin dot matrix printer introduced in 1987 by Apple Computer, Inc. The print quality was comparable to competing 24-pin dot-matrix printers, and offered graphics at 320 × 216 DPI. Guaranteed compatibility with both Apple II and Mac computers made it popular in schools.

The LQ had more options than any of the other Apple dot-matrix printers, including:
* ImageWriter II/LQ LocalTalk Option card or 32K memory buffer card
* Cut Sheet Feeder (US$299)
* Additional paper bins (US$169, each - maximum of 2) for the sheet feeder
* Envelope Feed for the sheet feeder (US$49)
* SCSI interface (not released)

Color ribbons were $149 for a box of six.

<doc id="294408" wikidata="Q1452678" url="?curid=294408" title="Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems">
<text>The Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems (after Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking) are a set of results in general relativity that attempt to answer the question of when gravitation produces singularities. The Penrose singularity theorem is a theorem in semi-Riemannian geometry and its general relativistic interpretation predicts a gravitational singularity in black hole formation. The Hawking singularity theorem is based on the Penrose theorem and it is interpreted as a gravitational singularity in the Big Bang situation. Penrose shared half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2020 &quot;for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity&quot;.

== Singularity ==
A singularity in solutions of the Einstein field equations is one of three things:

* Spacelike singularities: The singularity lies in the future or past of all events within a certain region. The Big Bang singularity and the typical singularity inside a non-rotating, uncharged Schwarzschild black hole are spacelike.
* Timelike singularities: These are singularities that can be avoided by an observer because they are not necessarily in the future of all events. An observer might be able to move around a timelike singularity. These are less common in known solutions of the Einstein field equations.
* Null singularities: These singularities occur on light-like or null surfaces. An example might be found in certain types of black hole interiors, such as the Cauchy horizon of a charged (Reissner–Nordström) or rotating (Kerr) black hole.

A singularity can be either strong or weak:

* Weak singularities: A weak singularity is one where the tidal forces (which are responsible for the spaghettification in black holes) are not necessarily infinite. An observer falling into a weak singularity might not be torn apart before reaching the singularity, although the laws of physics would still break down there. The Cauchy horizon inside a charged or rotating black hole might be an example of a weak singularity.
* Strong singularities: A strong singularity is one where tidal forces become infinite. In a strong singularity, any object would be destroyed by infinite tidal forces as it approaches the singularity. The singularity at the center of a Schwarzschild black hole is an example of a strong singularity.

Space-like singularities are a feature of non-rotating uncharged black holes as described by the Schwarzschild metric, while time-like singularities are those that occur in charged or rotating black hole exact solutions. Both of them have the property of geodesic incompleteness, in which either some light-path or some particle-path cannot be extended beyond a certain proper time or affine parameter (affine parameter being the null analog of proper time).

The Penrose theorem guarantees that some sort of geodesic incompleteness occurs inside &quot;any&quot; black hole whenever matter satisfies reasonable energy conditions. The energy condition required for the black-hole singularity theorem is weak: it says that light rays are always focused together by gravity, never drawn apart, and this holds whenever the energy of matter is non-negative.

Hawking&#x27;s singularity theorem is for the whole universe, and works backwards in time: it guarantees that the (classical) Big Bang has infinite density. This theorem is more restricted and only holds when matter obeys a stronger energy condition, called the &quot;strong energy condition&quot;, in which the energy is larger than the pressure. All ordinary matter, with the exception of a vacuum expectation value of a scalar field, obeys this condition. During inflation, the universe violates the dominant energy condition, and it was initially argued (e.g. by Starobinsky) that inflationary cosmologies could avoid the initial big-bang singularity. However, it has since been shown that inflationary cosmologies are still past-incomplete, and thus require physics other than inflation to describe the past boundary of the inflating region of spacetime.

It is still an open question whether (classical) general relativity predicts spacelike singularities in the interior of realistic charged or rotating black holes, or whether these are artefacts of high-symmetry solutions and turn into null or timelike singularities when perturbations are added.

== Interpretation and significance ==
In general relativity, a singularity is a place that objects or light rays can reach in a finite time where the curvature becomes infinite, or spacetime stops being a manifold. Singularities can be found in all the black-hole spacetimes, the Schwarzschild metric, the Reissner–Nordström metric, the Kerr metric and the Kerr–Newman metric, and in all cosmological solutions that do not have a scalar field energy or a cosmological constant.

One cannot predict what might come &quot;out&quot; of a big-bang singularity in our past, or what happens to an observer that falls &quot;in&quot; to a black-hole singularity in the future, so they require a modification of physical law. Before Penrose, it was conceivable that singularities only form in contrived situations. For example, in the collapse of a star to form a black hole, if the star is spinning and thus possesses some angular momentum, maybe the centrifugal force partly counteracts gravity and keeps a singularity from forming. The singularity theorems prove that this cannot happen, and that a singularity will always form once an event horizon forms.

In the collapsing star example, since all matter and energy is a source of gravitational attraction in general relativity, the additional angular momentum only pulls the star together more strongly as it contracts: the part outside the event horizon eventually settles down to a Kerr black hole (see No-hair theorem). The part inside the event horizon necessarily has a singularity somewhere. The proof is somewhat constructiveit shows that the singularity can be found by following light-rays from a surface just inside the horizon. But the proof does not say what type of singularity occurs, spacelike, timelike, null, orbifold, jump discontinuity in the metric. It only guarantees that if one follows the time-like geodesics into the future, it is impossible for the boundary of the region they form to be generated by the null geodesics from the surface. This means that the boundary must either come from nowhere or the whole future ends at some finite extension.

An interesting &quot;philosophical&quot; feature of general relativity is revealed by the singularity theorems. Because general relativity predicts the inevitable occurrence of singularities, the theory is not complete without a specification for what happens to matter that hits the singularity. One can extend general relativity
to a unified field theory, such as the Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac system, where no such singularities occur. 

== Elements of the theorems ==

In history, there is a deep connection between the curvature of a manifold and its topology. The Bonnet–Myers theorem states that a complete Riemannian manifold that has Ricci curvature everywhere greater than a certain positive constant must be compact. The condition of positive Ricci curvature is most conveniently stated in the following way: for every geodesic there is a nearby initially parallel geodesic that will bend toward it when extended, and the two will intersect at some finite length.

When two nearby parallel geodesics intersect (see conjugate point), the extension of either one is no longer the shortest path between the endpoints. The reason is that two parallel geodesic paths necessarily collide after an extension of equal length, and if one path is followed to the intersection then the other, you are connecting the endpoints by a non-geodesic path of equal length. This means that for a geodesic to be a shortest length path, it must never intersect neighboring parallel geodesics.

Starting with a small sphere and sending out parallel geodesics from the boundary, assuming that the manifold has a Ricci curvature bounded below by a positive constant, none of the geodesics are shortest paths after a while, since they all collide with a neighbor. This means that after a certain amount of extension, all potentially new points have been reached. If all points in a connected manifold are at a finite geodesic distance from a small sphere, the manifold must be compact.

Roger Penrose argued analogously in relativity. If null geodesics, the paths of light rays, are followed into the future, points in the future of the region are generated. If a point is on the boundary of the future of the region, it can only be reached by going at the speed of light, no slower, so null geodesics include the entire boundary of the proper future of a region. When the null geodesics intersect, they are no longer on the boundary of the future, they are in the interior of the future. So, if all the null geodesics collide, there is no boundary to the future.

In relativity, the Ricci curvature, which determines the collision properties of geodesics, is determined by the energy tensor, and its projection on light rays is equal to the null-projection of the energy–momentum tensor and is always non-negative. This implies that the volume of a congruence of parallel null geodesics once it starts decreasing, will reach zero in a finite time. Once the volume is zero, there is a collapse in some direction, so every geodesic intersects some neighbor.

Penrose concluded that whenever there is a sphere where all the outgoing (and ingoing) light rays are initially converging, the boundary of the future of that region will end after a finite extension, because all the null geodesics will converge. This is significant, because the outgoing light rays for any sphere inside the horizon of a black hole solution are all converging, so the boundary of the future of this region is either compact or comes from nowhere. The future of the interior either ends after a finite extension, or has a boundary that is eventually generated by new light rays that cannot be traced back to the original sphere.

== Nature of a singularity ==
The singularity theorems use the notion of geodesic incompleteness as a stand-in for the presence of infinite curvatures. Geodesic incompleteness is the notion that there are geodesics, paths of observers through spacetime, that can only be extended for a finite time as measured by an observer traveling along one. Presumably, at the end of the geodesic the observer has fallen into a singularity or encountered some other pathology at which the laws of general relativity break down.

=== Assumptions of the theorems ===
Typically a singularity theorem has three ingredients:

# An energy condition on the matter,
# A condition on the global structure of spacetime,
# Gravity is strong enough (somewhere) to trap a region.

There are various possibilities for each ingredient, and each leads to different singularity theorems.

=== Tools employed ===
A key tool used in the formulation and proof of the singularity theorems is the Raychaudhuri equation, which describes the divergence formula_1 of a congruence (family) of geodesics. The divergence of a congruence is defined as the derivative of the log of the determinant of the congruence volume. The Raychaudhuri
equation is

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the shear tensor of the congruence and formula_4 is also known as the Raychaudhuri scalar (see the congruence page for details). The key point is that formula_5 will be non-negative provided that the Einstein field equations hold and

* the null energy condition holds and the geodesic congruence is null, or
* the strong energy condition holds and the geodesic congruence is timelike.

When these hold, the divergence becomes infinite at some finite value of the affine parameter. Thus all geodesics leaving a point will eventually reconverge after a finite time, provided the appropriate energy condition holds, a result also known as the focusing theorem.

This is relevant for singularities thanks to the following argument:

# Suppose we have a spacetime that is globally hyperbolic, and two points formula_6 and formula_7 that can be connected by a timelike or null curve. Then there exists a geodesic of maximal length connecting formula_6 and formula_7. Call this geodesic formula_10.
# The geodesic formula_10 can be varied to a longer curve if another geodesic from formula_6 intersects formula_10 at another point, called a conjugate point.
# From the focusing theorem, we know that all geodesics from formula_6 have conjugate points at finite values of the affine parameter. In particular, this is true for the geodesic of maximal length. But this is a contradictionone can therefore conclude that the spacetime is geodesically incomplete.

In general relativity, there are several versions of the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorem. Most versions state, roughly, that if there is a trapped null surface and the energy density is nonnegative, then there exist geodesics of finite length that cannot be extended.

These theorems, strictly speaking, prove that there is at least one non-spacelike geodesic that is only finitely extendible into the past but there are cases in which the conditions of these theorems obtain in such a way that all past-directed spacetime paths terminate at a singularity.

=== Versions ===
There are many versions; below is the null version:

: Assume
# The null energy condition holds.
# We have a noncompact connected Cauchy surface.
# We have a closed trapped null surface formula_15.
: Then, we either have null geodesic incompleteness, or closed timelike curves.
:: &quot;Sketch of proof&quot;: Proof by contradiction. The boundary of the future of formula_15, formula_17 is generated by null geodesic segments originating from formula_15 with tangent vectors orthogonal to it. Being a trapped null surface, by the null Raychaudhuri equation, both families of null rays emanating from formula_15 will encounter caustics. (A caustic by itself is unproblematic. For instance, the boundary of the future of two spacelike separated points is the union of two future light cones with the interior parts of the intersection removed. Caustics occur where the light cones intersect, but no singularity lies there.) The null geodesics generating formula_17 have to terminate, however, i.e. reach their future endpoints at or before the caustics. Otherwise, we can take two null geodesic segmentschanging at the causticand then deform them slightly to get a timelike curve connecting a point on the boundary to a point on formula_15, a contradiction. But as formula_15 is compact, given a continuous affine parameterization of the geodesic generators, there exists a lower bound to the absolute value of the expansion parameter. So, we know caustics will develop for every generator before a uniform bound in the affine parameter has elapsed. As a result, formula_17 has to be compact. Either we have closed timelike curves, or we can construct a congruence by timelike curves, and every single one of them has to intersect the noncompact Cauchy surface exactly once. Consider all such timelike curves passing through formula_17 and look at their image on the Cauchy surface. Being a continuous map, the image also has to be compact. Being a timelike congruence, the timelike curves can&#x27;t intersect, and so, the map is injective. If the Cauchy surface were noncompact, then the image has a boundary. We&#x27;re assuming spacetime comes in one connected piece. But formula_17 is compact and boundariless because the boundary of a boundary is empty. A continuous injective map can&#x27;t create a boundary, giving us our contradiction.

:: &quot;Loopholes&quot;: If closed timelike curves exist, then timelike curves don&#x27;t have to intersect the &quot;partial&quot; Cauchy surface. If the Cauchy surface were compact, i.e. space is compact, the null geodesic generators of the boundary can intersect everywhere because they can intersect on the other side of space.

Other versions of the theorem involving the weak or strong energy condition also exist.

=== Modified gravity ===
In modified gravity, the Einstein field equations do not hold and so these singularities do not necessarily arise. For example, in Infinite Derivative Gravity, it is possible for formula_5 to be negative even if the Null Energy Condition holds.

<text>The BAFTA Games Awards or British Academy Games Awards are an annual British awards ceremony honouring &quot;outstanding creative achievement&quot; in the video game industry. First presented in 2004 following the restructuring of the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards, the awards are presented by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).

Since the inaugural BAFTA Games Awards in February 2004, twenty ceremonies have taken place. The most recent, the 20th British Academy Games Awards, was held at Queen Elizabeth Hall on 11 April 2024.

<text>John Edward Mack (October 4, 1929 – September 27, 2004) was an American psychiatrist, writer, and professor of psychiatry. He served as the head of the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School from 1977 to 2004. In 1977, Mack won the Pulitzer Prize for his book &quot;A Prince of Our Disorder&quot; on T. E. Lawrence.

Mack&#x27;s clinical expertise was in child psychology, adolescent psychology, and the psychology of religion. He was also known as a leading researcher on the psychology of teenage suicide and drug addiction, and he later became a researcher in the psychology of alien abduction experiences.

==Early life, education and military service==
Mack was born in New York City to an academic German Jewish family. His father, the historian Edward Clarence Mack (1904–1973), was a professor at CUNY, while his mother Eleanor Liebmann Mack (1905–1930) died while John was an infant. After his mother died, his father married the economist Ruth P. Mack, through which he had a half-sister, Mary Lee Ingbar, a pioneer of computer analysis who became a professor at Dartmouth College and University of Massachusetts Medical School. As John grew up, his father would read the Bible to him and his sister, but as a work of culture or literature. Mack graduated from the Horace Mann-Lincoln School in 1947 and Phi Beta Kappa from Oberlin in 1951 and received his medical doctorate degree &quot;cum laude&quot; from Harvard Medical School in 1955. Mack subsequently interned at the Massachusetts General Hospital and trained as a psychiatrist at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center.

In 1959, Mack joined the United States Air Force, serving as a medic in Japan, where he rose to the rank of captain. In 1961, he returned from military service in Japan, continuing at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center and Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, receiving certification in child and adult psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. From 1964, Mack returned to Harvard Medical School, becoming a full professor at Harvard in 1972. In 1977, he became the chairman of the executive committee of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, which position he occupied until his death in 2004.

Mack published over 150 scientific articles and eleven books in his career. As department head at Harvard Medical School, he worked primarily in the field of child and adolescent psychology. He worked on treating suicidal patients and published research on heroin addiction. The dominant theme of his life&#x27;s work at Harvard had been the exploration of how one&#x27;s perceptions of the world affect one&#x27;s relationships. He addressed this issue of &quot;world view&quot; on the individual level in his early clinical explorations of dreams, nightmares and teen suicide, and in &quot;A Prince of Our Disorder&quot;, his biographical study of the life of British officer T. E. Lawrence, for which he received the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1977.

== Activism during the Cold War ==
In the 1980s, Mack interviewed many international political figures as part of his research into the root causes of the Cold War, including former United States President Jimmy Carter and the &quot;father of the hydrogen bomb&quot;, Edward Teller.

Mack, together with astrophysicist Carl Sagan and other Physicians for Social Responsibility (the United States affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War), promoted the elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the simmering conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. Emboldened by the organization&#x27;s receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, Mack, Sagan, and 700 other academics walked upon the grounds of the Nevada Test Site in the summer of 1986, setting a civil disobedience record for that nuclear weapons testing facility.

==Psychology of alien abduction phenomena==
In the early 1990s, Mack commenced a decade-plus psychological study of 200 men and women who reported recurrent alien encounter experiences. Such encounters had seen some limited attention from academic figures, R. Leo Sprinkle perhaps being the earliest, in the 1960s. Mack, however, remains probably the most esteemed academic to have studied the subject.

He initially suspected that such persons were suffering from mental illness, but when no obvious pathologies were present in the persons he interviewed, his interest was piqued. Following encouragement from longtime friend Thomas Kuhn, who predicted that the subject might be controversial, but urged Mack to collect data and ignore prevailing materialist, dualist and &quot;either/or&quot; analysis, Mack began concerted study and interviews. Many of those he interviewed reported that their encounters had affected the way they regarded the world, including producing a heightened sense of spirituality and environmental concern.
Mack was somewhat more guarded in his investigations and interpretations of the abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that &quot;On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go.&quot; In a 1994 interview, Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed &quot;inclined to take these [abduction] reports at face value&quot;. Mack replied by saying &quot;Face value I wouldn&#x27;t say. I take them seriously. I don&#x27;t have a way to account for them.&quot; In a 1996 interview with PBS, he stated &quot; There are aspects of this which I believe we are justified in taking quite literally. That is, UFOs are in fact observed, filmed on camera at the same time that people are having their abduction experiences...It&#x27;s both literally, physically happening to a degree; and it&#x27;s also some kind of psychological, spiritual experience occurring and originating perhaps in another dimension.&quot; The BBC quoted Mack as saying, &quot;I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [But] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here, that I can&#x27;t account for in any other way, that&#x27;s mysterious. Yet I can&#x27;t know what it is, but it seems to me that it invites a deeper, further inquiry.&quot;

Mack noted that there was a worldwide history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-industrial societies. One example is the vision quest common to some Native American cultures. Only fairly recently in Western culture, notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts might best be considered as part of this larger tradition of visionary encounters.

His interest in the spiritual or transformational aspects of people&#x27;s alien encounters and his suggestion that the experience of alien contact itself may be more transcendent than physical in natureyet nonetheless realset him apart from many of his contemporaries, such as Budd Hopkins, who advocated the physical reality of aliens.

His later research broadened into the general consideration of the merits of an expanded notion of reality, one which allows for experiences that may not fit the Western materialist paradigm, yet deeply affect people&#x27;s lives. His second (and final) book on the alien encounter experience, &quot;Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters&quot; (1999), was as much a philosophical treatise connecting the themes of spirituality and modern world-views as it was the culmination of his work with the &quot;experiencers&quot; of alien encounters, to whom the book is dedicated.

In November 1994, Mack travelled to Ruwa, Zimbabwe, to interview children at the Ariel School who claimed that they had seen a UFO land near their school and aliens exit the craft.

==Investigation by Harvard==
In May 1994, the Dean of Harvard Medical School, Daniel C. Tosteson, appointed a committee of peers to confidentially review Mack&#x27;s clinical care and clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien encounters with him (some of their cases were written of in Mack&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;Abduction&quot;). Angela Hind wrote, &quot;It was the first time in Harvard&#x27;s history that a tenured professor was subjected to such an investigation.&quot;

The committee chairman was Arnold &quot;Budd&quot; Relman, M.D., a Professor of Medicine and of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School who served as editor of &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;. According to Daniel P. Sheehan, one of Mack&#x27;s attorneys, the committee&#x27;s draft report suggested that &quot;To communicate, in any way whatsoever, to a person who has reported a ‘close encounter’ with an extraterrestrial life form that this experience might well have been real ... is professionally irresponsible.”

Upon the public revelation of the existence of the committee (inadvertently revealed during the solicitation of witnesses for Mack&#x27;s defense, ten months into the process), questions arose from the academic community (including Harvard Professor of Law Alan Dershowitz) regarding the validity of an investigation of a tenured professor who was not suspected of ethics violations or professional misconduct. Concluding the fourteen-month investigation, Harvard then issued a statement stating that the Dean had &quot;reaffirmed Dr. Mack&#x27;s academic freedom to study what he wishes and to state his opinions without impediment,&quot; concluding &quot;Dr. Mack remains a member in good standing of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine.&quot; (Mack was censured in the committee&#x27;s report for what they believed were methodological errors, but Dean Tosteson took no action based on the committee&#x27;s assessment.) He had received legal help from Roderick MacLeish and Daniel Sheehan (of the Pentagon Papers case), and the support of Laurance Rockefeller, who also funded Mack&#x27;s non-profit organization for four consecutive years at $250,000 per year.

==Death==
On Monday, September 27, 2004, while in London to lecture at a T. E. Lawrence Society-sponsored conference, Mack was killed by a drunk driver heading west on Totteridge Lane. He was walking home alone, after a dinner with friends, when he was struck at 11:25 p.m. near the junction of Totteridge Lane and Longland Drive. He lost consciousness at the scene of the crash and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. The driver, Raymond Czechowski, an IT manager, was arrested at the scene and later entered a plea of guilty to careless driving while under the influence of alcohol. Mack&#x27;s family requested leniency for the driver in a letter to the Wood Green Crown Court. &quot;Although this was a tragic event for our family,&quot; the letter reads, &quot;we feel [the accused&#x27;s] behavior was neither malicious nor intentional, and we have no ill will toward him since we learned of the circumstances of the collision.&quot; The driver, Ray Czechowski, served 6 months and was disqualified from driving for 3 years.

<doc id="294413" wikidata="Q3295536" url="?curid=294413" title="Martin Marprelate">
<text>Martin Marprelate (sometimes printed as Martin Mar-prelate and Marre–Martin) was the name used by the anonymous author or authors of the seven Marprelate tracts that circulated illegally in England in the years 1588 and 1589. Their principal focus was an attack on the episcopacy of the Anglican Church.

==Background==
In 1583, the appointment of John Whitgift as Archbishop of Canterbury had signalled the beginning of a drive against the Presbyterian movement in the church, and an era of censorship began. In 1586, by an edict of the Star Chamber, the archbishop was empowered to license and control all of the printing apparatus in the country.

==Identity and authorship==
The true identity of &quot;Martin&quot; was for a long time the subject of speculation. For many years, the main candidate was John Penry, a Welsh preacher and author of several impassioned polemics against the state of the church. Renaissance historian John Dover Wilson posited, in his 1912 book &quot;Martin Marprelate and Shakespeare&#x27;s Fluellen&quot;, the Welsh soldier Roger Williams was the author of the first three tracts signed &quot;Martin Prelate&quot;, with Penry authoring the subsequent tracts signed &quot;Martin Junior&quot; and the Warwickshire squire and Member of Parliament Job Throckmorton the author of those signed &quot;Martin Senior&quot;. In 1981 Leland Carlson argued for the authorship of Job Throckmorton. Kathryn M. Longley and Patrick Collinson suggested George Carleton. Henry M. Dexter argued for Henry Barrow.

Recent scholarship, the most authoritative and exhaustive being Joseph Black&#x27;s &quot;The Martin Marprelate Tracts: A Modernized and Annotated Edition&quot;, has established that Throckmorton was the main author, assisted by Penry.

The tracts had to be printed in secrecy, and some sort of organisation was involved to handle their production and distribution. Penry was definitely involved in the printing, and the press was frequently relocated to different parts of the country to avoid the authorities. Penry himself denied any involvement in the actual authorship.

==Official reaction==
The government was concerned enough at the virulence of the attacks on the ecclesiastical hierarchy to respond in kind, hiring professional writers such as Thomas Nashe, Robert Greene and John Lyly to write counter-tracts. The tracts are invectives against the episcopacy and sometimes described the bishops as representing the Antichrist. The most prolific and effective of the anti-Martinists went by the colourful sobriquet, &quot;the renowned Cavaliero Pasquill&quot;. Pasquill was traditionally believed to have been Thomas Nashe, however R. B. McKerrow, the editor of Nashe&#x27;s complete works refutes this: &quot;further study led me to suspect – indeed, to feel almost certain – that Nashe had nothing to do with them (anti-Marprelates texts).&quot; Francis Bacon also involved himself in the pamphleteering, writing &quot;An Advertisement Touching the Controversies of the Church of England&quot; in 1589, a piece which did not leave the bishops free from criticism. 

Some scholars, notably Arul Kumuran, have argued Robert Greene&#x27;s later works were influenced by the Marprelate pamphlets, though Greene is noted as an anti-Martinist author.

==Later influence and interpretation==
Some of the Marprelate pamphlets were reprinted in the seventeenth century, and an extensive scholarship has commented on their historical and literary significance. The anti-Martinist literature, including the Pasquill pamphlets, by contrast, has suffered from relative neglect by scholars of early modern England.

During the English civil war, Leveller pamphleteer Richard Overton embraced Marprelate&#x27;s legacy by publishing several tracts as &quot;Martin Marpriest&quot;, purportedly Martin Marprelate&#x27;s son.

The Marprelate tracts are important documents in the history of English satire: critics from C. S. Lewis to John Carey have recognised their originality. In particular, the pamphlets show concern with the status of the text, wittily pastiching conventions such as the colophon and marginalia.

<text>AppleWorks was an integrated office suite containing a word processor, database, and spreadsheet. It was developed by Rupert Lissner for Apple Computer, originally for the Apple II and launched in 1984. Many enhancements for AppleWorks were created, the most popular being the TimeOut series from Beagle Bros which extended the life of the Apple II version of AppleWorks. Appleworks was later reworked for the Macintosh platform.

AppleWorksGS was developed for the Apple IIGS using the graphical desktop interface instead of the text-based filecard interface of the Apple II. AppleWorksGS was slow and buggy; a planned version 2.0 never materialized. Beagle Bros created a BeagleWorks program that was eventually sold to the Apple subsidiary Claris. ClarisWorks for Macintosh (1991), and Windows (1993) became a popular program and saw rapid development. Those applications do not share any code with the 8-bit Apple II original. Apple absorbed Claris and the name ClarisWorks was changed to AppleWorks. It was bundled with all consumer-level Macintoshes sold by Apple until its discontinuation. As of 2007, AppleWorks had not been updated in several years and was unable to run on the Intel processors shipping in new Macs. On August 15, 2007, Apple announced AppleWorks had reached end-of-life status, and would no longer be sold. Apple instead promoted its recently launched iWork suite as a replacement, which contains word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation applications with capabilities similar to AppleWorks, but is not directly compatible with AppleWorks file formats.

==History==
=== AppleWorks (Apple II, 1984–1991) ===
Developed by Rupert Lissner, the original AppleWorks is one of the first integrated office suites for personal computers, featuring a word processor, spreadsheet, and database merged into a single program. It was released in 1984 as a demonstration product for the new 128K models of the Apple II line.

In 1982, Apple published Lissner&#x27;s Quick File, a database program that closely resembled what would become the AppleWorks database module, on both the Apple III and Apple II. Apple favored Apple Pascal at the time, so Lissner initially wrote Quick File in that language at Apple&#x27;s request. Lissner preferred coding in assembly language, however, and soon rewrote Quick File in assembly on his Apple III and, by summer of 1983, he had added word processor and spreadsheet modules as well. Apple initially purchased the rights to distribute both the Apple III and Apple II versions of the program. However, Apple decided to drop support for the Apple III and sold the rights for the Apple III version to Haba Systems, who marketed it as III E-Z Pieces and released it shortly before Apple released AppleWorks. The two products shared the same file formats.

All three AppleWorks programs have the same user interface and exchange data through a common clipboard. Previous Apple II application programs had mainly been designed with the older II/II+ line in mind, having only 48K of RAM and 40-column text (in the absence of an add-on card), thus limiting the software&#x27;s capabilities. In contrast, Appleworks was designed for the IIe and IIc models which have more RAM, standard 80-column text, an optional numeric keypad, cursor keys, and the new ProDOS operating system in place of DOS 3.3 which had been standard on 48K machines.

AppleWorks debuted at #2 on Softalk&#x27;s monthly bestseller list and quickly became the best-selling software package on any computer, ousting even Lotus 1-2-3 from the top of the industry-wide sales charts. Apple&#x27;s software subsidiary Claris sold the one millionth copy of AppleWorks in December 1988.

Apple and Lissner provided limited technical information on modifying AppleWorks, helping to create a substantial market for third-party accessories and support. Apple released version 2.0 in 1986 with the Apple IIGS, and then a year later the program was published by Claris. The September 1986 issue of &quot;inCider&quot; contained two AppleWorks-related articles; advertisements for two AppleWorks-related expansion cards from Applied Engineering, an application promising to let AppleWorks run on an Apple II Plus with an 80-column display board, an AppleWorks-dedicated newsletter called &quot;The Main Menu&quot;, and an AppleWorks-related product from Beagle Bros; many other advertisements that mentioned AppleWorks; and a column criticizing companies that developed AppleWorks-related products instead of new ones (&quot;thinks small and innovates nothing&quot;). Two years later Beagle Bros released the TimeOut series for AppleWorks and grossed millions of dollars. Thanks to the UltraMacros programming language they included, many other third-party developers innovated new products that used AppleWorks as a foundation and virtual operating system. 
&quot;Compute!&#x27;s Apple Applications&quot; reported in 1987 that &quot;AppleWorks has become a frontier for software developers&quot;, and predicted that &quot;Soon, the best software on the Apple II computer line will require AppleWorks&quot;. Claris contracted with Beagle Bros to upgrade AppleWorks to version 3.0 in 1989; TimeOut developers Alan Bird, Randy Brandt, and Rob Renstrom added new features and incorporated numerous TimeOut functions.

By 1989, Claris turned its attention to producing Macintosh and Windows software, letting AppleWorks languish. Claris did, however, agree to license the AppleWorks trademark to Quality Computers. TimeOut developers Randy Brandt and Dan Verkade then created AppleWorks 4.0 in 1993 and AppleWorks 5.0 in 1994, published by Quality Computers along with training videos.

The original 8-bit AppleWorks (which included 16-bit memory management on the IIGS) is sometimes referred to as &quot;AppleWorks Classic&quot; to differentiate it from AppleWorks GS and the later product for Macintosh and Windows.

==== Version history ====

=== AppleWorks GS (Apple IIGS, 1988–1996) ===
Observers had expected AppleWorks 2.0 to have a Macintosh-like mouse-driven graphical user interface, but &quot;inCider&quot; reported before its release that such a revision had been delayed because of &quot;problems between Apple and [Lissner]&quot;. It was nonetheless very popular among IIGS owners; in December 1987 &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Apple Applications&quot; reported that &quot;the hottest product on the Apple IIGS is &quot;AppleWorks&quot;. No mouse interface, no color, no graphics. Just &quot;AppleWorks&quot; from the IIe and IIc world&quot;. The magazine wondered in an editorial, &quot;&quot;AppleWorks&quot;, Where Are You?&quot;, stating that a IIGS version of AppleWorks or another AppleWorks-like integrated suite &quot;could galvanize the machine&#x27;s sales&quot; and warned that otherwise &quot;the IIGS may well languish&quot;.

In 1988, Claris acquired an integrated package called GS Works from StyleWare and renamed it AppleWorks GS, bringing the AppleWorks brand to the 16-bit Apple IIGS, though no code from the 8-bit Apple II version is used. In addition to the word processing, database, and spreadsheet functions, AppleWorks GS also includes telecommunications, page layout and graphics modules. Only one major version of AppleWorks GS exists, progressing as far as 1.1; a vaporware 2.0 update was rumored to be &quot;just short of completion&quot; for a long time. AppleWorks GS can open AppleWorks files without needing to import them first.

==== GS version history ====
=== AppleWorks and ClarisWorks (Macintosh and Windows, 1991–2004) ===

The second incarnation of AppleWorks began as ClarisWorks, written by Bob Hearn and Scott Holdaway and published by Claris, a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple, also known as FileMaker Inc.) The Creator code of ClarisWorks for the Macintosh is &quot;BOBO&quot;. ClarisWorks combines these applications:
* A word processor, which in version 6 also includes an equation editor based on MathType.
* A drawing program,
* A painting program,
* A spreadsheet,
* A database program, and
* A terminal program for communications (up to and including version 5), or
* A presentation program (in version 6).

All the components are integrated to provide a seamless suite that works in concert; for example, spreadsheet frames can be embedded in a word processing document, or formatted text into drawings, etc. The components are not derived from the contemporary Claris programs MacWrite and MacDraw but written from scratch and then redesigned to match other Claris programs after the purchase by Claris.

ClarisWorks 1.0 shipped for the Macintosh in October 1991.

ClarisWorks 2.0 was released on March 24, 1993.

ClarisWorks 3.0 was released in October 1994. It is the last version to run on the 68000 CPU with at least System 6.0.7.

ClarisWorks 4.0 was released on June 14, 1995. It requires a 68020 CPU and System 7.

When the Claris company was disbanded and absorbed back into Apple, the product was renamed AppleWorks; version 5.0 was released on August 24, 1997, shortly before the product&#x27;s return to Apple and was briefly called ClarisWorks 5. ClarisWorks/AppleWorks 5 requires System 7.0.1, though the 5.0.4 patch can only be applied in Mac OS 9. It is the last version to support the 68k CPU architecture.

The last major version, AppleWorks 6.0, released at MacWorld Expo in January 2000, requires a PowerPC CPU and replaces the communications module with a presentation module (in prior versions there was only rudimentary support for presentations through the other modules). It was also ported to the Carbon API to work on Mac OS X, but as an early Carbon application, it does not take advantage of many of the newer features of Mac OS X and portions of the interface still retain elements of the Platinum appearance of Mac OS 8/9.

Using Claris&#x27;s XTND framework, AppleWorks can create, open, and save files in a number of file formats. For example, word processor documents can be saved in Microsoft Word format, and spreadsheet files can be saved in Microsoft Excel format.

The software received good reviews during the course of its lifespan for its interface and the tight integration of its modules. For example, like the earlier versions, in AppleWorks a drawing &quot;frame&quot; can be placed in a spreadsheet document, a paint frame can be placed in a drawing document, etc. This allows for very elaborate and data-rich layouts. However, the limitations of the product became more apparent as the product aged. The program also only allows for a single undo/redo, and in many cases, if a frame from one module is placed in another module, the frame may no longer be editable in any way as soon as it is deselected.

Equation Editor by Design Science is bundled with AppleWorks. Also, the MathType or MathMagic equation editors can be used. Both support automatic baseline alignment for inline equations.

===Discontinuation===
In August 2007, Apple declared AppleWorks &quot;end of life&quot; and stated that they would no longer sell the package. The iWork package, which includes a word processing program, a spreadsheet, and a presentation graphics program, is intended to be its replacement. While more feature-rich, iWork still lacks some of the modules and the tight integration of AppleWorks. AppleWorks will not run on any versions of Mac OS X later than Snow Leopard because it is compiled for the PowerPC CPU architecture.

AppleWorks word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation files can be opened in earlier versions of iWork applications Pages, Numbers, and Keynote respectively, but not since 2013. Collabora Online, LibreOffice or Apache OpenOffice can open AppleWorks word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation files. A script exists for batch converting Appleworks (.cwk) files to MS Word (.docx) format (usable by Pages) using the command-line interface for LibreOffice. There is no Apple-supplied application to open AppleWorks database, painting, or drawing files without converting them to a different format. EazyDraw Retro supports the import of the AppleWorks drawing formats. This software runs on Mojave and older. AppleWorks User Group continues support, and migrating away from AppleWorks is possible.

Several of the core engineers behind ClarisWorks left to form Gobe Software whose main product, GoBe Productive, would be released on BeOS, Windows, and Linux.

==Reception==
&quot;II Computing&quot; listed AppleWorks ninth on the magazine&#x27;s list of the top Apple II non-game, non-educational software as of late 1985, based on sales and market-share data.

&quot;BYTE&quot;″s reviewer in December 1984 called AppleWorks &quot;easy to use, genuinely user-friendly, and well documented&quot;. She called the word processor &quot;my favorite part ... well above average&quot; and the spreadsheet and database &quot;good but certainly not standouts&quot;. As a package for novice and casual users, the reviewer concluded, &quot;Appleworks is excellent&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; that month disagreed, calling it &quot;a study in limitations ... this package is not strong&quot;. While approving of the shared clipboard and user interface, the magazine stated that Appleworks&#x27; limitations—such as the limit of eight pages in the word processor with 64K RAM—made it &quot;not good enough as a business product to warrant much consideration&quot;.

&quot;Compute!&quot; in 1989 stated that &quot;Though not a speed demon&quot; like the original 8-bit AppleWorks, the GS version &quot;isn&#x27;t as slow as many had feared&quot;; although a fast typist could still outrun the computer&#x27;s display, it performed better than other Apple IIGS software. Although many original users bought the IIGS version, with reportedly 35,000 copies sold in the first three weeks, the magazine warned that they &quot;must forget virtually everything they&#x27;ve learned ... What a pain&quot;.

<doc id="294418" wikidata="Q78508" url="?curid=294418" title="Erich von Stroheim">
<text>Erich Oswald Hans Carl Maria von Stroheim (born Erich Oswald Stroheim; September 22, 1885 – May 12, 1957) was an Austrian-American director, screenwriter, actor, and producer, most noted as a film star and avant-garde, visionary director of the silent era. His 1924 film &quot;Greed&quot; (an adaptation of Frank Norris&#x27;s 1899 novel &quot;McTeague&quot;) is considered one of the finest and most important films ever made. After clashes with Hollywood studio bosses over budget and workers&#x27; rights problems, Stroheim found it difficult to find work as a director and subsequently became a well-respected character actor, particularly in French cinema.

For his early innovations, Stroheim is still celebrated as one of the first of the auteur directors. He helped introduce more sophisticated plots and noirish sexual and psychological undercurrents into cinema. He died of prostate cancer in France in 1957, at the age of 71. Beloved by Parisian neo-Surrealists known as Lettrists, he was honored by Lettrist Maurice Lemaître with a 70-minute 1979 film titled &quot;Erich von Stroheim&quot;.

==Background and personal life==
Stroheim was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1885 as Erich Oswald Stroheim (some sources give Hans Erich Maria Stroheim von Nordenwall, but this seems to have been an assumed name, see below), the son of Benno Stroheim, a middle-class hatmaker, and Johanna Bondy, both of whom were observant Jews.

Stroheim deserted his military service and emigrated to America aboard the on November 26, 1909. On arrival at Ellis Island, he claimed to be Count Erich Oswald Hans Carl Maria von Stroheim und Nordenwall, the son of Austrian nobility like the characters he would go on to play in his films. However, he first found work as a traveling salesman – work which took him to San Francisco and then Hollywood.

Both Billy Wilder and Stroheim&#x27;s agent Paul Kohner claimed that he spoke with a decidedly lower-class Austrian accent. His years in America seem to have affected his speech, though. In &quot;The Great Gabbo&quot;, Stroheim&#x27;s German, though fluid, has Midwestern American &quot;r&quot;&#x27;s. Later, while living in Europe, Stroheim claimed in published remarks to have &quot;forgotten&quot; his native tongue. In Renoir&#x27;s movie &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot;, Stroheim speaks German with what seems to be an American accent. Similarly, in his French-speaking roles, von Stroheim speaks with a noticeable American accent. Jean Renoir writes in his memoirs: &quot;Stroheim spoke hardly any German. He had to study his lines like a schoolboy learning a foreign language.&quot;

However, the fashion photographer Helmut Newton, whose first language was German, used a clip from a Stroheim film on which to base one of his fantasy nude photographs, and he has commented that in the clip Stroheim speaks &quot;a very special kind of Prussian officer lingo – it&#x27;s very abrupt: it&#x27;s very, very funny&quot;.

Stroheim was married three times. He was married to Margaret Knox from 1913 to 1915; His second marriage was to Mae Jones from 1916 to 1919. He was never divorced from his third wife Valerie Germonprez, though he lived with actress Denise Vernac, from 1939 until his death. Vernac also starred with him in several films. Two of Stroheim&#x27;s sons eventually joined the film business: Erich Jr. (1916–1968) as an assistant director and Josef (1922–2002) as a sound editor.

After appearing in 1950&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, Stroheim moved to France where he spent the last part of his life. There his silent film work was much admired by artists in the French film industry. In France he acted in films, wrote several novels that were published in French, and worked on various unrealized film projects. He was awarded the French Legion of Honour shortly before his death.

In 1956, Stroheim began to suffer severe back pain, which was diagnosed as cancer. He eventually became paralyzed and was carried to his drawing room to receive the Legion of Honor award from an official delegation. He died at his chateau in Maurepas near Paris on May 12, 1957, at age 71.

==Film career==
By 1914, he was working in Hollywood. He began working in movies as a stuntman, and then in bit-parts and as a consultant on German culture and fashion. His first film, in 1915, was &quot;The Country Boy&quot;, in which he was uncredited. His first credited role came in &quot;Old Heidelberg&quot;.

He began working with D. W. Griffith, taking an uncredited role as a Pharisee in &quot;Intolerance&quot;. Additionally, Stroheim acted as one of the many assistant directors on &quot;Intolerance&quot;, a film remembered in part for its huge cast of extras. Later, with America&#x27;s entry into World War I, he played sneering German villains in such films as &quot;Sylvia of the Secret Service&quot; and &quot;The Hun Within&quot;. In &quot;The Heart of Humanity&quot;, he tears the buttons from a nurse&#x27;s uniform with his teeth, and when disturbed by a crying baby, throws it out of a window.

Following the end of the war, Stroheim turned to writing and then directed his own script for &quot;Blind Husbands&quot; in 1919. He also starred in the film. As a director, Stroheim was known to be dictatorial and demanding, often antagonizing his actors. He is considered one of the greatest directors of the silent era, creating films that represent cynical and romantic views of human nature. In the 1932 film &quot;The Lost Squadron&quot;, Stroheim played a parody of himself as a fanatic German film director making a World War I movie, who orders extras playing dead soldiers to &quot;Stay dead!&quot; Recurring tropes in his films include the portrayal of janitors, and the depiction of characters with physical disabilities.

His next directorial efforts were the lost film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Pass Key&quot; (1919) and &quot;Foolish Wives&quot; (1922), in which he also starred. Studio publicity for &quot;Foolish Wives&quot; claimed that it was the first film to cost $1 million.

In 1923, Stroheim began work on &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;. He cast the American actor Norman Kerry as Count Franz Maximilian von Hohenegg, a part written for himself, and newcomer Mary Philbin in the lead actress role. However studio executive Irving Thalberg fired Stroheim during filming and replaced him with director Rupert Julian.

Probably Stroheim&#x27;s best remembered work as a director is &quot;Greed&quot;, a detailed filming of the novel &quot;McTeague&quot; by Frank Norris. He originally started it as a project with Samuel Goldwyn&#x27;s Goldwyn Pictures. Stroheim had long wanted to do a film version of the book. He originally intended it to be a highly detailed reproduction of the original, shot mostly at the locations described in the book in San Francisco and Death Valley. Von Stroheim shot in San Francisco with his actors in period dress and silent movie makeup while the city itself was represented in its modern form. Automobiles can be seen in the background of some scenes and any &quot;extras&quot; or passersby are in (what was for the time) modern clothing. When the production did move to Death Valley it was in the middle of summer. &quot;Greed&quot; is also considered by some film historians to be the first feature-length film shot on location. The original print ran for an astonishing 10 hours. Knowing this version was far too long, Stroheim cut almost half the footage, reducing it to a six-hour version to be shown over two nights. It still was deemed too long, so Stroheim and director Rex Ingram edited it into a four-hour version that could be shown in two parts.

However, in the midst of filming, Goldwyn Pictures was bought by Marcus Loew and merged into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. After rejecting Stroheim&#x27;s attempts to cut it to less than three hours, MGM removed &quot;Greed&quot; from his control and gave it to head scriptwriter June Mathis, with orders to cut it to a manageable length. Mathis gave the print to a cutter, who reduced it to 2.5 hours. 
The shortened release version was a box-office failure, and was angrily disowned by Stroheim. In particular, he blamed Mathis for destroying his pet project, since she was credited as a writer due to contractual obligations. However, Mathis had worked with Stroheim before and had long admired him, so it is not likely she would have indiscriminately butchered his film. The film was partially reconstructed in 1999 by producer Rick Schmidlin, using the existing footage mixed with surviving still photographs, but the original cut of &quot;Greed&quot; has passed into cinema lore as a lost masterpiece.

Stroheim followed with a commercial project, &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, his most commercially successful film; the more personal &quot;The Wedding March&quot;, as well as the now-lost &quot;The Honeymoon&quot;.

Stroheim&#x27;s unwillingness or inability to modify his artistic principles for the commercial cinema, his extreme attention to detail, his insistence on near-total artistic freedom and the resulting costs of his films led to fights with the studios. As time went on, he received fewer directing opportunities.

In 1929, Stroheim was dismissed as the director of the film &quot;Queen Kelly&quot;, after disagreements with star Gloria Swanson and producer and financier Joseph P. Kennedy over the mounting costs of the film and Stroheim&#x27;s introduction of indecent subject matter into the film&#x27;s scenario.

After &quot;Queen Kelly&quot; and &quot;Walking Down Broadway&quot;, a project from which Stroheim was also dismissed, Stroheim returned to working principally as an actor, in both American and French films.

His stern nature, as well as some of his villainous roles, earned him the nickname &quot;the man you love to hate&quot;.

Working in France on the eve of World War II, Stroheim was prepared to direct the film &quot;La dame blanche&quot; from his own story and screenplay. Jean Renoir wrote the dialogue, Jacques Becker was to be assistant director and Stroheim himself, Louis Jouvet and Jean-Louis Barrault were to be the featured actors. Max Cossvan was to produce the film for Demo-Film. The production was prevented by the outbreak of the war on September 1, 1939, and Stroheim returned to the United States.

Stroheim is perhaps best known as an actor for his role as Rauffenstein in Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (1937) and as Max von Mayerling in Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950). For the latter film, which also starred Gloria Swanson, Stroheim was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Excerpts from &quot;Queen Kelly&quot; were used in the film. The Mayerling character states that he used to be one of the three great directors of the silent era, along with D. W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille; many film critics agree that Stroheim was indeed one of the great early directors. Stroheim&#x27;s character in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; thus had an autobiographical basis that reflected the humiliations suffered throughout his career.

He appeared as a guest star in the 1953 anthology drama television series &quot;Orient Express&quot; in the episode titled &quot;The Man of Many Skins&quot;.

==Quotes==

&quot;Lubitsch shows you first the king on the throne, then as he is in the bedroom. I show you the king in the bedroom so you&#x27;ll know just what he is when you see him on his throne.&quot;

&quot;If you live in France, for instance, and you have written one good book, or painted one good picture, or directed one outstanding film 50 years ago and nothing else since, you are still recognized and honored accordingly. People take their hats off to you and call you &#x27;maître&#x27;. They do not forget. In Hollywood—in Hollywood, you&#x27;re as good as your last picture. If you didn&#x27;t have one in production within the last three months, you&#x27;re forgotten, no matter what you have achieved ere this.&quot;

<text>Sunscreen, also known as sunblock, sun lotion or sun cream, is a photoprotective topical product for the skin that helps protect against sunburn and prevent skin cancer. Sunscreens come as lotions, sprays, gels, foams (such as an expanded foam lotion or whipped lotion), sticks, powders and other topical products. Sunscreens are common supplements to clothing, particularly sunglasses, sunhats and special sun protective clothing, and other forms of photoprotection (such as umbrellas).

Sunscreens may be classified according to the type of active ingredient(s) present in the formulation (inorganic compounds or organic molecules) as:

* Mineral sunscreens (also referred to as physical), which use only inorganic compounds (zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide) as active ingredients. These ingredients primarily work by absorbing UV rays but also through reflection and refraction.
* Chemical sunscreens, which use organic molecules as active ingredients. These products are sometimes referred to as petrochemical sunscreens since the active organic molecules are synthesized starting from building blocks typically derived from petroleum. Chemical sunscreen ingredients also mainly work by absorbing the UV rays. Over the years, some organic UV absorbers have been heavily scrutinised to assess their toxicity and a few of them have been banned in places such as Hawaii and Thailand for their impact on aquatic life and the environment.
* Hybrid sunscreens, which contain a combination of organic and inorganic UV filters.

Medical organizations such as the American Cancer Society recommend the use of sunscreen because it aids in the prevention of squamous cell carcinomas. The routine use of sunscreens may also reduce the risk of melanoma. To effectively protect against all the potential damages of UV light, the use of broad-spectrum sunscreens (covering both UVA and UVB radiation) has been recommended.

== History ==
Early civilizations used a variety of plant products to help protect the skin from sun damage. For example, ancient Greeks used olive oil for this purpose, and ancient Egyptians used extracts of rice, jasmine, and lupine plants whose products are still used in skin care today. Zinc oxide paste has also been popular for skin protection for thousands of years. Among the nomadic sea-going Sama-Bajau people of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia, a common type of sun protection is a paste called &quot;borak&quot; or &quot;burak&quot;, which was made from water weeds, rice and spices. It is used most commonly by women to protect the face and exposed skin areas from the harsh tropical sun at sea. In Myanmar, thanaka, a yellow-white cosmetic paste made of ground bark, is traditionally used for sun protection. In Madagascar, a ground wood paste called masonjoany has been worn for sun protection, as well as decoration and insect repellent, since the 18th century, and is ubiquitous in the Northwest coastal regions of the island to this day.

The first ultraviolet B filters were produced in 1928. Followed by the first sunscreen, invented in Australia by chemist H.A. Milton Blake, in 1932 formulating with the UV filter &#x27;salol&#x27; (Phenyl salicylate) at a concentration of 10%. Its protection was verified by the University of Adelaide. In 1936, L&#x27;Oreal released its first sunscreen product, formulated by French chemist Eugène Schueller.

The US military was an early adopter of sunscreen. In 1944, as the hazards of sun overexposure became apparent to soldiers stationed in the Pacific tropics at the height of World War II, Benjamin Green, an airman and later a pharmacist produced Red Vet Pet (for red veterinary petrolatum) for the US military. Sales boomed when Coppertone improved and commercialized the substance under the Coppertone girl and Bain de Soleil branding in the early 1950s. In 1946, Austrian chemist Franz Greiter introduced a product, called &quot;Gletscher Crème&quot; (Glacier Cream), subsequently became the basis for the company Piz Buin, named in honor of the mountain where Greiter allegedly received the sunburn.

In 1974, Greiter adapted earlier calculations from Friedrich Ellinger and Rudolf Schulze and introduced the &quot;sun protection factor&quot; (SPF), which has become the global standard for measuring UVB protection. It has been estimated that &quot;Gletscher Crème&quot; had an SPF of 2.

Water-resistant sunscreens were introduced in 1977, and recent development efforts have focused on overcoming later concerns by making sunscreen protection both longer-lasting and broader-spectrum (protection from both UVA &amp; UVB rays), more environmentally friendly, more appealing to use and addressing the safety concerns of petrochemical sunscreens, i.e. FDA studies showing their systematic absorption into the bloodstream.

== Health effects ==
=== Benefits ===
Sunscreen use can help prevent melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma, two types of skin cancer. There is little evidence that it is effective in preventing basal cell carcinoma.

A 2013 study concluded that the diligent, everyday application of sunscreen could slow or temporarily prevent the development of wrinkles and sagging skin. The study involved 900 white people in Australia and required some of them to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen every day for four and a half years. It found that people who did so had noticeably more resilient and smoother skin than those assigned to continue their usual practices. A study on 32 subjects showed that daily use of sunscreen (SPF 30) reversed photoaging of the skin within 12 weeks and the amelioration continued until the end of the investigation period of one year. Sunscreen is inherently anti-ageing as the sun is the number one cause of premature ageing; it therefore may slow or temporarily prevent the development of wrinkles, dark spots, and sagging skin.

Minimizing UV damage is especially important for children and fair-skinned individuals and those who have sun sensitivity for medical reasons.

=== Risks ===
In February 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) started classifying already approved UV filter molecules into three categories: those which are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE), those which are non-GRASE due to safety issues, and those requiring further evaluation. As of 2021, only zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are recognized as GRASE. Two previously approved UV filters, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and trolamine salicylate, were banned in 2021 due to safety concerns. The remaining FDA approved active ingredients were put in the third category as their manufacturers have yet to produce sufficient safety data — despite the fact that some of the chemicals have sold in sunscreen products for more than 40 years. Some researchers argue that the risk of sun-induced skin cancer outweighs concerns about toxicity and mutagenicity, although environmentalists say this ignores &quot;ample safer alternatives available on the market containing the active ingredient minerals zinc oxide or titanium dioxide&quot;, which are also safer for the environment.

Regulators can investigate and ban UV filters over safety concerns (such as PABA), which can result in withdrawal of products from the consumer market. Regulators, such as the TGA and the FDA, have also been concerned with recent reports of contamination in sunscreen products with known possible human carcinogens such as benzene and benzophenone. Independent laboratory testing carried out by Valisure found benzene contamination in 27% of the sunscreens they tested, with some batches having up to triple the FDA&#x27;s conditionally restricted limit of 2 parts per million (ppm). This resulted in a voluntary recall by some major sunscreen brands that were implicated in the testing, as such, regulators also help publicise and coordinate these voluntary recalls. VOC&#x27;s (Volatile Organic Compounds) such as benzene, are particularly harmful in sunscreen formulations as many active and inactive ingredients can increase permeation across the skin. Butane, which is used as a propellant in spray sunscreens, has been found to have benzene impurities from the refinement process.

There is a risk of an allergic reaction to sunscreen for some individuals, as &quot;Typical allergic contact dermatitis may occur in individuals allergic to any of the ingredients that are found in sunscreen products or cosmetic preparations that have a sunscreen component. The rash can occur anywhere on the body where the substance has been applied and sometimes may spread to unexpected sites.&quot;

==== Vitamin D production ====
There are some concerns about potential vitamin D deficiency arising from prolonged use of sunscreen. The typical use of sunscreen does not usually result in vitamin D deficiency; however, extensive usage may. Sunscreen prevents ultraviolet light from reaching the skin, and even moderate protection can substantially reduce vitamin D synthesis. However, adequate amounts of vitamin D can be obtained via diet or supplements. Vitamin D overdose is impossible from UV exposure due to an equilibrium the skin reaches in which vitamin D degrades as quickly as it is created.

High-SPF sunscreens filter out most UVB radiation, which triggers vitamin D production in the skin. However, clinical studies show that regular sunscreen use does not lead to vitamin D deficiency. Even high-SPF sunscreens allow a small amount of UVB to reach the skin, sufficient for vitamin D synthesis. Additionally, brief, unprotected sun exposure can produce ample vitamin D, but this exposure also risks significant DNA damage and skin cancer. To avoid these risks, vitamin D can be obtained safely through diet and supplements. Foods like fatty fish, fortified milk, and orange juice, along with supplements, provide necessary vitamin D without harmful sun exposure.
Studies have shown that sunscreen with a high UVA protection factor enabled significantly higher vitamin D synthesis than a low UVA protection factor sunscreen, likely because it allows more UVB transmission.

== Measurements of protection ==
=== Sun protection factor and labeling ===
The sun protection factor (SPF rating, introduced in 1974) is a measure of the fraction of sunburn-producing UV rays that reach the skin. For example, &quot;SPF 15&quot; means that of the burning radiation will reach the skin, assuming sunscreen is applied evenly at a thick dosage of 2 milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm2). It is important to note that sunscreens with higher SPF do not last or remain effective on the skin any longer than lower SPF and must be continually reapplied as directed, usually every two hours.

The SPF is an imperfect measure of skin damage because invisible damage and skin malignant melanomas are also caused by ultraviolet A (UVA, wavelengths 315–400 or 320–400 nm), which does not primarily cause reddening or pain. Conventional sunscreen blocks very little UVA radiation relative to the nominal SPF; broad-spectrum sunscreens are designed to protect against both UVB and UVA. According to a 2004 study, UVA also causes DNA damage to cells deep within the skin, increasing the risk of malignant melanomas. Even some products labeled &quot;broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection&quot; have not always provided good protection against UVA rays. Titanium dioxide probably gives good protection but does not completely cover the UVA spectrum, with early 2000s research suggesting that zinc oxide is superior to titanium dioxide at wavelengths 340–380 nm.

Owing to consumer confusion over the real degree and duration of protection offered, labelling restrictions are enforced in several countries. In the EU, sunscreen labels can only go up to SPF 50+ (initially listed as 30 but soon revised to 50). Australia&#x27;s Therapeutic Goods Administration increased the upper limit to 50+ in 2012. In its 2007 and 2011 draft rules, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a maximum SPF label of 50, to limit unrealistic claims. (As of August 2019, the FDA has not adopted the SPF 50 limit.) Others have proposed restricting the active ingredients to an SPF of no more than 50, due to lack of evidence that higher dosages provide more meaningful protection, despite a common misconception that protection directly scales with SPF; doubling when SPF is doubled. Different sunscreen ingredients have different effectiveness against UVA and UVB.

The SPF can be measured by applying sunscreen to the skin of a volunteer and measuring how long it takes before sunburn occurs when exposed to an artificial sunlight source. In the US, such an &quot;in vivo&quot; test is required by the FDA. It can also be measured &quot;in vitro&quot; with the help of a specially designed spectrometer. In this case, the actual transmittance of the sunscreen is measured, along with the degradation of the product due to being exposed to sunlight. In this case, the transmittance of the sunscreen must be measured over all wavelengths in sunlight&#x27;s UVB–UVA range (290–400 nm), along with a table of how effective various wavelengths are in causing sunburn (the &quot;erythemal action spectrum&quot;) and the standard intensity spectrum of sunlight (see the figure). Such &quot;in vitro&quot; measurements agree very well with &quot;in vivo&quot; measurements.

Numerous methods have been devised for evaluation of UVA and UVB protection. The most-reliable spectrophotochemical methods eliminate the subjective nature of grading erythema.

The ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) is a similar scale developed for rating fabrics for sun protective clothing. According to recent testing by &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, UPF ~30+ is typical for protective fabrics, while UPF ~20 is typical for standard summer fabrics.

Mathematically, the SPF (or the UPF) is calculated from measured data as:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the solar irradiance spectrum, formula_3 the erythemal action spectrum, and formula_4 the monochromatic protection factor, all functions of the wavelength formula_5. The MPF is roughly the inverse of the transmittance at a given wavelength.

The combined SPF of two layers of sunscreen may be lower than the square of the single-layer SPF.

=== UVA protection ===

==== Persistent pigment darkening ====
The persistent pigment darkening (PPD) method is a method of measuring UVA protection, similar to the SPF method of measuring sunburn protection. Originally developed in Japan, it is the preferred method used by manufacturers such as L&#x27;Oréal.

Instead of measuring erythema, the PPD method uses UVA radiation to cause a persistent darkening or tanning of the skin. Theoretically, a sunscreen with a PPD rating of 10 should allow a person 10 times as much UVA exposure as would be without protection. The PPD method is an &quot;in vivo&quot; test like SPF. In addition, the European Cosmetic and Perfumery Association (&quot;Colipa&quot;) has introduced a method that, it is claimed, can measure this &quot;in vitro&quot; and provide parity with the PPD method.

==== SPF equivalence ====
As part of revised guidelines for sunscreens in the EU, there is a requirement to provide the consumer with a minimum level of UVA protection in relation to the SPF. This should be a UVA protection factor of at least 1/3 of the SPF to carry the UVA seal. The 1/3 threshold derives from the European Commission recommendation 2006/647/EC. This Commission recommendation specifies that the UVA protection factor should be measured using the PPD method as modified by the French health agency AFSSAPS (now ANSM) &quot;or an equivalent degree of protection obtained with any in vitro method&quot;.

A set of final US FDA rules effective from summer 2012 defines the phrase &quot;broad spectrum&quot; as providing UVA protection proportional to the UVB protection, using a standardized testing method.

==== Star rating system ====
In the UK and Ireland, the Boots star rating system is a proprietary &quot;in vitro&quot; method used to describe the ratio of UVA to UVB protection offered by sunscreen creams and sprays. Based on original work by Brian Diffey at Newcastle University, the Boots Company in Nottingham, UK, developed a method that has been widely adopted by companies marketing these products in the UK.

One-star products provide the lowest ratio of UVA protection, five-star products the highest. The method was revised in light of the Colipa UVA PF test and the revised EU recommendations regarding UVA PF. The method still uses a spectrophotometer to measure absorption of UVA versus UVB; the difference stems from a requirement to pre-irradiate samples (where this was not previously required) to give a better indication of UVA protection and photostability when the product is used. With the current methodology, the lowest rating is three stars, the highest being five stars.

In August 2007, the FDA put out for consultation the proposal that a version of this protocol be used to inform users of American product of the protection that it gives against UVA; but this was not adopted, for fear it would be too confusing.

==== PA system ====
Asian brands, particularly Japanese ones, tend to use The Protection Grade of UVA (PA) system to measure the UVA protection that a sunscreen provides. The PA system is based on the PPD reaction and is now widely adopted on the labels of sunscreens. According to the Japan Cosmetic Industry Association, PA+ corresponds to a UVA protection factor between two and four, PA++ between four and eight, and PA+++ more than eight. This system was revised in 2013 to include PA++++ which corresponds to a PPD rating of sixteen or above.

==== Expiration date ====
Some sunscreens include an expiration date—a date indicating when they may become less effective.

== Active ingredients ==
Sunscreen formulations contain UV absorbing compounds (the active ingredients) dissolved or dispersed in a mixture of other ingredients, such as water, oils, moisturizers, and antioxidants. The UV filters can be either:

* Organic compounds which absorb ultraviolet light. Some organic compounds (bisoctrizole and phenylene bis-diphenyltriazine) also partially reflect incident light. These are also referred to as &quot;chemical&quot; UV filters.
* Inorganic compounds (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide), which reflect, scatter, and absorb UV light. These are also referred to as &quot;mineral&quot; filters.

The organic compounds used as UV filter are often aromatic molecules conjugated with carbonyl groups. This general structure allows the molecule to absorb high-energy ultraviolet rays and release the energy as lower-energy rays, thereby preventing the skin-damaging ultraviolet rays from reaching the skin. So, upon exposure to UV light, most of the ingredients (with the notable exception of avobenzone) do not undergo significant chemical change, allowing these ingredients to retain the UV-absorbing potency without significant photodegradation. A chemical stabilizer is included in some sunscreens containing avobenzone to slow its breakdown. The stability of avobenzone can also be improved by bemotrizinol, octocrylene and various other photostabilisers. Most organic compounds in sunscreens slowly degrade and become less effective over the course of several years even if stored properly, resulting in the expiration dates calculated for the product.

Sunscreening agents are used in some hair care products such as shampoos, conditioners and styling agents to protect against protein degradation and color loss. Currently, benzophenone-4 and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate are the two sunscreens most commonly used in hair products. The common sunscreens used on skin are rarely used for hair products due to their texture and weight effects.

UV filters need usually to be approved by local agencies (such as the FDA in the United States) to be used in sunscreen formulations. As of 2023, 29 compounds are approved in the European Union and 17 in the USA. No UV filters have been approved by the FDA for use in cosmetics since 1999.

The following are the FDA allowable active ingredients in sunscreens:

Zinc oxide was approved as a UV filter by the EU in 2016.

Other ingredients approved within the EU and other parts of the world, that have not been included in the current FDA Monograph:

* Time and Extent Application (TEA), Proposed Rule on FDA approval originally expected 2009, now expected 2015.

Many of the ingredients awaiting approval by the FDA are relatively new, and developed to absorb UVA. The 2014 Sunscreen Innovation Act was passed to accelerate the FDA approval process.

== Inactive ingredients ==
It is known that SPF is affected by not only the choice of active ingredients and the percentage of active ingredients but also the formulation of the vehicle/base. Final SPF is also impacted by the distribution of active ingredients in the sunscreen, how evenly the sunscreen applies on the skin, how well it dries down on the skin and the pH value of the product among other factors. Changing any inactive ingredient may potentially alter a sunscreen&#x27;s SPF.

When combined with UV filters, added antioxidants can work synergistically to affect the overall SPF value positively. Furthermore, adding antioxidants to sunscreen can amplify its ability to reduce markers of extrinsic photoaging, grant better protection from UV induced pigment formation, mitigate skin lipid peroxidation, improve the photostability of the active ingredients, neutralize reactive oxygen species formed by irradiated photocatalysts &quot;(e.g., uncoated TiO₂)&quot; and aid in DNA repair post-UVB damage, thus enhancing the efficiency and safety of sunscreens. Compared with sunscreen alone, it has been shown that the addition of antioxidants has the potential to suppress ROS formation by an additional 1.7-fold for SPF 4 sunscreens and 2.4-fold for SPF 15-to-SPF 50 sunscreens, but the efficacy depends on how well the sunscreen in question has been formulated. Sometimes osmolytes are also incorporated into commercially available sunscreens in addition to antioxidants since they also aid in protecting the skin from the detrimental effects of UVR. Examples include the osmolyte taurine, which has demonstrated the ability to protects against UVB-radiation induced immunosuppression and the osmolyte ectoine, which aids in counteracting cellular accelerated aging &amp; UVA-radiation induced premature photoaging.

Other inactive ingredients can also assist in photostabilizing unstable UV filters. Cyclodextrins have demonstrated the ability to reduce photodecomposition, protect antioxidants and limit skin penetration past the uppermost skin layers, allowing them to longer maintain the protection factor of sunscreens with UV filters that are highly unstable and/or easily permeate to the lower layers of the skin. Similarly, film-forming polymers like polyester-8 and polycryleneS1 have the ability to protect the efficacy of older petrochemical UV filters by preventing them from destabilizing due to extended light exposure. These kinds of ingredients also increase the water resistance of sunscreen formulations.


In the 2010s and 2020s, there has been increasing interest in sunscreens that protect the wearer from the sun&#x27;s high-energy visible light and infrared light as well as ultraviolet light. This is due to newer research revealing blue &amp; violet visible light and certain wavelengths of infrared light &quot;(e.g., NIR, IR-A)&quot; work synergistically with UV light in contributing to oxidative stress, free radical generation, dermal cellular damage, suppressed skin healing, decreased immunity, erythema, inflammation, dryness, and several aesthetic concerns, such as: wrinkle formation, loss of skin elasticity and dyspigmentation. Increasingly, a number of commercial sunscreens are being produced that have manufacturer claims regarding skin protection from blue light, infrared light and even air pollution. However, as of 2021 there are no regulatory guidelines or mandatory testing protocols that govern these claims. Historically, the American FDA has only recognized protection from sunburn &quot;(via UVB protection)&quot; and protection from skin cancer &quot;(via SPF 15+ with some UVA protection)&quot; as drug/medicinal sunscreen claims, so they do not have regulatory authority over sunscreen claims regarding protecting the skin from damage from these other environmental stressors. Since sunscreen claims not related to protection from ultraviolet light are treated as cosmeceutical claims rather than drug/medicinal claims, the innovative technologies and additive ingredients used to allegedly reduce the damage from these other environmental stressors may vary widely from brand to brand.

Some studies show that mineral sunscreens primarily made with substantially large particles &quot;(i.e., neither nano nor micronized)&quot; may help protect from visible and infrared light to some degree, but these sunscreens are often unacceptable to consumers due to leaving an obligatory opaque white cast on the skin. Further research has shown that sunscreens with added iron oxide pigments and/or pigmentary titanium dioxide can provide the wearer with a substantial amount of HEVL protection. Cosmetic chemists have found that other cosmetic-grade pigments can be functional filler ingredients. Mica was discovered to have significant synergistic effects with UVR filters when formulated in sunscreens, in that it can notably increase the formula&#x27;s ability to protect the wearer from HEVL.

There is a growing amount of research demonstrating that adding various vitamer antioxidants &quot;(eg; retinol, alpha tocopherol, gamma tocopherol, tocopheryl acetate, ascorbic acid, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate, ascorbyl palmitate, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, ubiquinone)&quot; and/or a mixture of certain botanical antioxidants &quot;(eg; epigallocatechin-3-gallate, b-carotene, vitis vinifera, silymarin, spirulina extract, chamomile extract and possibly others)&quot; to sunscreens efficaciously aids in reducing damage from the free radicals produced by exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation, visible light, near infrared radiation and infrared-a radiation. Since sunscreen&#x27;s active ingredients work preventatively by creating a shielding film on the skin that absorbs, scatters, and reflects light before it can reach the skin, UV filters have been deemed an ideal “first line of defense” against sun damage when exposure can&#x27;t be avoided. Antioxidants have been deemed a good “second line of defense” since they work responsively by decreasing the overall burden of free radicals that do reach the skin. The degree of the free radical protection from the entire solar spectral range that a sunscreen can offer has been termed the &quot;radical protection factor&quot; (RPF) by some researchers.

== Application ==
SPF 30 or above must be used to effectively prevent UV rays from damaging skin cells. This is the amount that is recommended to prevent against skin cancer. Sunscreen must also be applied thoroughly and re-applied during the day, especially after being in the water. Special attention should be paid to areas like the ears and nose, which are common spots of skin cancer. Dermatologists may be able to advise about what sunscreen is best to use for specific skin types.

The dose used in FDA sunscreen testing is 2 mg/cm2 of exposed skin. If one assumes an &quot;average&quot; adult build of height 5 ft 4 in (163 cm) and weight 150 lb (68 kg) with a 32-inch (82-cm) waist, that adult wearing a bathing suit covering the groin area should apply approximately 30 g (or 30 ml, approximately 1 oz) evenly to the uncovered body area. This can be more easily thought of as a &quot;golf ball&quot; size amount of product per body, or at least six teaspoonfuls. Larger or smaller individuals should scale these quantities accordingly. Considering only the face, this translates to about 1/4 to 1/3 of a teaspoon for the average adult face.

Some studies have shown that people commonly apply only 1/4 to 1/2 of the amount recommended for achieving the rated sun protection factor (SPF), and in consequence the effective SPF should be downgraded to a 4th root or a square root of the advertised value, respectively. A later study found a significant exponential relation between SPF and the amount of sunscreen applied, and the results are closer to linearity than expected by theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOI10.1111/j.1600-0781.2009.00408.x&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims that substances in pill form can act as sunscreen are false and disallowed in the United States.

== Regulation ==

; Palau 
On 1 January 2020, Palau banned the manufacturing and selling of sun cream products containing any of the following ingredients: benzophenone-3, octyl methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, 4-methyl-benzylidene camphor, triclosan, methylparaben, ethylparaben, butylparaben, benzyl paraben, and phenoxyethanol. The decision was taken to protect the local coral reef and sea life. Those compounds are known or suspected to be harmful to coral or other sea life.

; United States
Sunscreen labeling standards have been evolving in the United States since the FDA first adopted the SPF calculation in 1978. The FDA issued a comprehensive set of rules in June 2011, taking effect in 2012–2013, designed to help consumers identify and select suitable sunscreen products offering protection from sunburn, early skin aging, and skin cancer. However, unlike other countries, the United States classifies sunscreen as an over-the-counter drug rather than a cosmetic product. As FDA approval of a new drug is typically far slower than for a cosmetic, the result is fewer ingredients available for sunscreen formulations in the US compared with many other countries.

In 2019, the FDA proposed tighter regulations on sun protection and general safety, including the requirement that sunscreen products with SPF greater than 15 must be broad spectrum, and imposing a prohibition on products with SPF greater than 60.

* To be classified as &quot;broad spectrum&quot;, sunscreen products must provide protection against both UVA and UVB, with specific tests required for both.
* Claims of products being &quot;waterproof&quot; or &quot;sweatproof&quot; are prohibited, while the terms &quot;sunblock&quot; and &quot;instant protection&quot; and &quot;protection for more than 2 hours&quot; are all prohibited without specific FDA approval.
* &quot;Water resistance&quot; claims on the front label must indicate how long the sunscreen remains effective and specify whether this applies to swimming or sweating, based on standard testing.
* Sunscreens must include standardized &quot;Drug Facts&quot; information on the container. However, there is no regulation that deems it necessary to mention whether the contents contain nanoparticles of mineral ingredients. Furthermore, US products do not require the expiration date of products to be displayed on the label.

In 2021, the FDA introduced an additional administrative order regarding the safety classification of cosmetic UV filters, to categorize a given ingredient as either:

* Generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE)
* Not GRASE due to safety issues
* Not GRASE because additional safety data are needed.

To be considered a GRASE active ingredient, the FDA requires it to have undergone both non-clinical animal studies as well as human clinical studies. The animal studies evaluate the potential for inducing carcinogenesis, genetic or reproductive harm, and any toxic effects of the ingredient once absorbed and distributed in the body. The human trials expand upon the animal trials, providing additional information on safety in the pediatric population, protection against UVA and UVB, and the potential for skin reactions after application. Two previously approved UV filters, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and trolamine salicylate, were reclassified as &quot;not GRASE&quot; due to safety concerns and have consequently been removed from the market.

Europe

In Europe, sunscreens are considered a cosmetic product rather than an over-the-counter drug. These products are regulated by the Cosmetic Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, which was created in July 2013. The recommendations for formulating sunscreen products are guided by the Scientific Community on Consumer Safety (SCCS). The regulation of cosmetic products in Europe requires the producer to follow six domains when formulating their product:

I. Cosmetic safety report must be conducted by a qualified personnel

II. The product must not contain substances banned for cosmetic products

III. The product must not contain substances restricted for cosmetic products

IV. The product must adhere to the approved list of colourants for cosmetic products.

V. The product must adhere to the approved list of preservatives for cosmetic products.

VI. The product must contain UV filters approved in Europe.

According to the EC, sunscreens at a minimum must exhibit:

# A SPF of 6
# UVA/UVB ratio ≥ 1/3
# The critical wavelength is at least 370 nanometers (indicating that it is &quot;broad-spectrum&quot;).
# Instructions for using and precautions.
# Evidence the sunscreen meets UVA and SPF requirements.
# Labels of European sunscreens must disclose the use of nanoparticles in addition to the shelf life of the product.

Canada

Regulation of sunscreen is dependent on the ingredient used; It is then classified and follows the regulations for either natural health products or drug product. Companies must complete a product licensing application prior to introducing their sunscreen on the market.

ASEAN (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam)

The regulation of sunscreen for ASEAN countries closely follows European regulations. However, products are regulated by the ASEAN scientific community rather than the SCCS. Additionally, there are minor differences in the allowed phrasing printed on sunscreen packages.

Japan

Sunscreen is considered a cosmetic product, and is regulated under the Japan Cosmetic Industry Association (JCIA). Products are regulated mostly for the type of UV filter and SPF. SPF may range from 2 to 50.

China

Sunscreen is regulated as cosmetic product under the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). The list of approved filters is the same as it is in Europe. However, sunscreen in China requires safety testing in animal studies prior to approval.

Australia

Sunscreens are divided into therapeutic and cosmetic sunscreens. Therapeutic sunscreens are classified into primary sunscreens (SPF ≥ 4) and secondary sunscreens (SPF &lt; 4). Therapeutic sunscreens are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Cosmetic sunscreens are products that contain a sunscreen ingredient, but do not protect from the sun. These products are regulated by the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS).

New Zealand

Sunscreen is classified as a cosmetic product, and closely follows EU regulations. However, New Zealand has a more extensive list of approved UV filters than Europe.

Mercosur

Mercosur is an international group consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Regulation of sunscreen as a cosmetic product began in 2012, and is similar in structure to the European regulations. Sunscreens must meet specific standards including water resistance, sun protection factor, and a UVA/UVB ratio of 1/3. The list of approved sunscreen ingredients is greater than in Europe or the US.

== Environmental effects ==
Some sunscreen active ingredients have been shown to cause toxicity towards marine life and coral, resulting in bans in different states, countries and ecological areas. Coral reefs, comprising organisms in delicate ecological balances, are vulnerable to even minor environmental disturbances. Factors like temperature changes, invasive species, pollution, and detrimental fishing practices have previously been highlighted as threats to coral health.

In 2018, Hawaii passed legislation that prohibits the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate. In sufficient concentrations, oxybenzone and octinoxate can damage coral DNA, induce deformities in coral larvae, heighten the risk of viral infections, and make corals more vulnerable to bleaching. Such threats are even more concerning given that coral ecosystems are already compromised by climate change, pollution, and other environmental stressors. While there is ongoing debate regarding the real-world concentrations of these chemicals versus laboratory settings, an assessment in Kahaluu Bay in Hawaii showed oxybenzone concentrations to be 262 times higher than what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designates as high-risk. Another study in Hanauma Bay found levels of the chemical ranging from 30 ng/L to 27,880 ng/L, noting that concentrations beyond 63 ng/L could induce toxicity in corals.

Echoing Hawaii&#x27;s initiative, other regions including Key West, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Bonaire, and Palau have also instituted bans on sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate.

The environmental implications of sunscreen usage on marine ecosystems are multi-faceted and vary in severity. In a 2015 study, titanium dioxide nanoparticles, when introduced to water and subjected to ultraviolet light, were shown to amplify the production of hydrogen peroxide, a compound known to damage phytoplankton. In 2002, research indicated that sunscreens might escalate virus abundance in seawater, compromising the marine environment in a manner akin to other pollutants. Further probing the matter, a 2008 investigation examining a variety of sunscreen brands, protective factors, and concentrations revealed unanimous bleaching effects on hard corals. Alarmingly, the degree of bleaching magnified with increasing sunscreen quantities. When assessing individual compounds prevalent in sunscreens, substances such as butylparaben, ethylhexylmethoxycinnamate, benzophenone-3, and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor induced complete coral bleaching at even minimal concentrations.

A 2020 study from the journal &quot;Current Dermatology Report&quot; summarized the situation as the US FDA currently approving only zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) as safe ultraviolet filters, and for those concerned with coral bleaching, they should use non-nano ZnO or TiO2 since they have the most consistent safety data.

== Research and Development ==
New products are in development such as sunscreens based on bioadhesive nanoparticles. These function by encapsulating commercially used UV filters, while being not only adherent to the skin but also non-penetrant. This strategy inhibits primary UV-induced damage as well as secondary free radicals. UV filters based on sinapate esters are also under study. Sunscreens with natural and sustainable connotations are increasingly being developed, as a result of increased environmental concern.

<text>Cephas Washburn (July 25, 1793 – March 17, 1860) was a Christian missionary and educator who worked with the Cherokee of northwest Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma. He later worked to establish churches in Arkansas.

==Early life and education==
Cephas Washburn was born on July 25, 1793, in Rutland, Vermont. His parents were Josiah W. and Phebe (née Cushman) Washburn. His father was a farmer, and Cephas seemed destined to follow in that occupation. However, he suffered a broken leg while working and decided to take up teaching as a career. While raising enough money to pursue higher education, he taught school in Groton, Massachusetts, in 1814 and 1815. While teaching, he became a member of the Congregationalist church and decided to become a missionary to the Indians. 

He graduated from the University of Vermont, and the Andover Theological Seminary. After graduating from the University of Vermont, he was ordained as a Congregational minister. The Royalton Congregational Association in Randolph, Vermont, licensed Washburn to preach in January 1818. 

On October 6, 1818, he married Abigail F. Woodward of Randolph, Vermont.

==Career==
After the Washburns were married, Cephas was ordained in 1818 in Waitsfield, Vermont, by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) to serve as a missionary to the Eastern Cherokee Indians, who then lived primarily lived in the U.S. State of Georgia. He was assigned to the Cherokee. He remained in Georgia for about one year. Then the ABCFM sent him to Arkansas as the missionary to Cherokees who had already begun moving west. These people would thereafter be called &quot;Western Cherokees&quot;.

He served as a missionary to the Cherokee Indians at Brainerd Mission, Tennessee, for a short while. He migrated with them westward, arriving in Arkansas in 1819. This was a group that removed relatively early from the Southeast, rather than waiting for forced removal after the US Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Most Cherokee were removed across the Mississippi River to a designated part of Indian Territory (present Eastern Oklahoma)in 1838.

The party that traveled to Arkansas included not only Cephas Washburn and his wife, but also his brother in law, Reverend Alfred Finney, as well as several others who would support the educational facility. Washburn founded Dwight Presbyterian Mission near present-day Russellville in 1820 to serve the newly arrived Cherokee. Dwight was the first American mission to the Indians west of the Mississippi River. It was named for Rev. Timothy Dwight, president of Yale College and a corporate member of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Dwight Mission (later called &quot;Old Dwight Mission&quot;) in Arkansas was supplanted by another mission with the same name in Indian Territory, near what is now Sallisaw, Oklahoma. The latter became known as &quot;New Dwight Mission&quot;.

Washburn served as the primary Indian missionary in the Arkansas region until he resigned in 1850. From 1850 to 1856 he served as minister for the First Presbyterian Church in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

==Later life, death and burial==
Cephas Washburn died at Little Rock, Arkansas, on March 17, 1860, of pneumonia, while traveling to Helena, Arkansas, for an evangelical meeting. He is buried at the historic Mount Holly Cemetery in downtown Little Rock.

==Family==
Washburn&#x27;s son Edward Payson Washburn was the artist who painted the well-known &quot;Arkansas Traveller&quot; painting. It received wide distribution and recognition when printed as a Currier &amp; Ives lithograph. The painting was inspired by the humorous song &quot;Arkansas Traveller&quot; by Sandford C. Faulkner. His granddaughter Mabel Washbourne Anderson was a noted Cherokee writer.

<doc id="294423" wikidata="Q40070" url="?curid=294423" title="Takashi Shimura">
<text>was a Japanese actor who appeared in over 200 films between 1934 and 1981. He appeared in 21 of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 30 films (more than any other actor), including as a lead actor in &quot;Drunken Angel&quot; (1948), &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950), &quot;Ikiru&quot; (1952) and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954). He played Professor Kyohei Yamane in Ishirō Honda&#x27;s original &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954) and its first sequel, &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; (1955). For his contributions to the arts, the Japanese government decorated Shimura with the Medal with Purple Ribbon in 1974 and the Order of the Rising Sun, 4th Class, Gold Rays with Rosette in 1980.

==Early life==
Shimura was born in Ikuno, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. His forebears were members of the samurai class: in 1868 his grandfather took part in the Battle of Toba–Fushimi during the Boshin War. Shimura entered Ikuno Primary School in 1911 and Kobe First Middle School in 1917. He missed two years of schooling because of a mild case of tuberculosis, and subsequently moved to the prefectural middle school in Nobeoka, Miyazaki Prefecture, where his father had been transferred by his employer, Mitsubishi Mining. At Nobeoka Middle School, he excelled in English and became active on the literary society&#x27;s magazine, to which he contributed poetry. He also became a star of the rowing club.

In 1923, he entered Kansai University, but after his father&#x27;s retirement the family could no longer afford the fees for a full-time course and he switched to the part-time evening course in English literature, supporting himself by working at the Osaka municipal waterworks. Among the teachers in the English Literature Department were the playwright Toyo-oka Sa-ichirō (豊岡佐一郎) and the Shakespeare scholar Tsubouchi Shikō (坪内士行). These two inspired in Shimura an enthusiasm for drama. He joined the University&#x27;s Theatre Studies Society and in 1928 formed an amateur theatrical group, the Shichigatsu-za (七月座) with Toyo-oka as director. He began to miss work because of the time he spent on theatrical activities and eventually lost his job. He then left university to try to earn a living in the theatre. The Shichigatsu-za turned professional and began to tour, but got into financial difficulties and folded.

==Career==
After the failure of the Shichigatsu-za, Shimura went back to Osaka, where he began to get roles in radio plays. In 1930 he joined the Kindaiza (近代座) theatre company and became a fully professional actor. He toured China and Japan with the Kindaiza, but in 1932 he left the company and returned again to Osaka, where he appeared with the Shinseigeki (新声劇) and Shinsenza (新選座) troupes. Talking pictures were just then coming in and Shimura realised they would provide opportunities for stage-trained actors. In 1932 he joined the Kyoto studios of the film production company Shinkō Kinema. He made his film debut in the 1934 silent &quot;Ren&#x27;ai-gai itchōme&quot; (恋愛街一丁目: &quot;Number One, Love Street&quot;). The first film in which he had a speaking part was the 1935 &quot;Chūji uridasu&quot; (忠次売出す), directed by Mansaku Itami. His first substantial film role was as a detective in Mizoguchi Kenji&#x27;s 1936 &quot;Osaka Elegy&quot; (&quot;Naniwa erejii&quot;; 浪華悲歌).


The film which established his reputation as a first-rate actor was Itami Mansaku&#x27;s 1936 &quot;Akanishi Kakita&quot; (赤西蠣太: &quot;Capricious Young Man&quot;). In 1937 he moved to Nikkatsu film corporation&#x27;s Kyoto studios, and between then and 1942 appeared in nearly 100 films. His most notable role in these years was that of Keishirō in the long-running series &quot;Umon Torimono-chō&quot; (右門捕物帖), starring Kanjūrō Arashi. He also demonstrated his considerable ability as a singer in the 1939 &quot;cine-operetta&quot;, &quot;Singing Lovebirds&quot;. During this time the political regime in Japan was growing ever more oppressive, and Shimura was arrested by the Special Higher Police (Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu, known as Tokkō) and held for about three weeks because of his earlier association with left-wing theatre groups. He was eventually released on the recognisance of his wife Masako and fellow-actor Ryūnosuke Tsukigata. He is said to have made use of this experience later when playing a Tokkō official in Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1946 &quot;No Regrets for Our Youth&quot;. When Nikkatsu and Daiei merged in 1942, Shimura moved to the Kōa Eiga studios and then in 1943 to Tōhō. A few weeks before the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, Shimura&#x27;s elder brother was killed in Southeast Asia.
In 1943, Shimura appeared as the old jujutsu teacher Murai Hansuke, a character based on the historical Hansuke Nakamura, in Kurosawa&#x27;s debut movie, &quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot;. Along with Toshirō Mifune, Shimura is the actor most closely associated with Kurosawa: he eventually appeared in 21 of Kurosawa&#x27;s 30 films. In fact, Kurosawa&#x27;s cinematic collaboration with Shimura, from &quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot; in 1943 to &quot;Kagemusha&quot; in 1980, started earlier and lasted longer than his work with Mifune (1948–65). Shimura&#x27;s performances for Kurosawa included the doctor in &quot;Drunken Angel&quot; (1948), the veteran detective in &quot;Stray Dog&quot; (1949), the flawed lawyer in &quot;Scandal&quot; (1950), the woodcutter in &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950), the mortally ill bureaucrat in &quot;Ikiru&quot; (1952), and the lead samurai Kambei in &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954). Kurosawa wrote the part in &quot;Kagemusha&quot; specifically for Shimura, but the scenes were cut from the Western release, so many in the West did not know that he had been in the film. The DVD release of the film by The Criterion Collection restored Shimura&#x27;s footage.

Shimura appeared in a number of Tōhō &quot;kaiju&quot; (giant monster) and &quot;tokusatsu&quot; (special effects) films, many of which were directed by Kurosawa&#x27;s good friend and colleague Ishirō Honda. Shimura&#x27;s roles included Professor Kyohei Yamane in the original &quot;Godzilla&quot; (1954), a character he briefly reprised in &quot;Godzilla Raids Again&quot; (1955).

==Death==
Shimura died on February 11, 1982, in Tokyo, Japan, from emphysema at the age of 76. His effects were presented to the Film Centre of the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo.

<doc id="294425" wikidata="Q5345813" url="?curid=294425" title="Edward Washburn">
<text>Edward Payson Washburn (1831 – March 26, 1860) also known as Edward Payson Washbourne, was an American painter. He was the son of Christian missionary Cephas Washburn. He is best known for his painting, &quot;The Arkansas Traveller&quot; (1856). During the Antebellum era, he was one of the most notable painters in the state of Arkansas.

==Biography==

Edward Payson Washburn painted the image of the &quot;Arkansas Traveler&quot; in 1856, from a story he heard from Colonel Sandford C. Faulkner. Supposedly occurring on the campaign trail in Arkansas in 1840, Colonel Faulkner&#x27;s humorous story ends with a fiddle playing squatter being won over by the traveler (man on horse in image).

The painting was later a basis of engravings by Leopold Grozelier of Boston in 1859, and Currier and Ives of New York City about 1870, with a sample from the Arkansas Traveler tune. In addition to the painting and prints, the story of the Arkansas Traveler was also turned into a tune, dialogue and play.

It was created south of present-day Russellville, Arkansas at the Washburn family homestead site near Norristown. Washburn cemetery, near the old homestead, still exists today. The painting was widely distributed as a Currier &amp; Ives lithograph. It was inspired by the composition of the same name by Colonel Sanford C. Faulkner (1806–1874).

Washburn died in Little Rock, Arkansas, only nine days after his father, and is buried at Mount Holly Cemetery.

<doc id="294429" wikidata="Q177918" url="?curid=294429" title="First Balkan War">
<text>The First Balkan War lasted from October 1912 to May 1913 and involved actions of the Balkan League (the Kingdoms of Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and Montenegro) against the Ottoman Empire. The Balkan states&#x27; combined armies overcame the initially numerically inferior (significantly superior by the end of the conflict) and strategically disadvantaged Ottoman armies, achieving rapid success.

The war was a comprehensive and unmitigated disaster for the Ottomans, who lost 83% of their European territories and 69% of their European population. As a result of the war, the League captured and partitioned almost all of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s remaining territories in Europe. Ensuing events also led to the creation of an independent Albania, which dissatisfied the Serbs. Bulgaria, meanwhile, was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in Macedonia and attacked its former allies, Serbia and Greece, on 16 June 1913, which provoked the start of the Second Balkan War.

During the war, many civilians, overwhelmingly Muslim Turks, were either killed or forced to flee their homes. The highly politicized and disorganized units of the Ottoman army were quite incapable of evacuating the civilians in the war zone. This situation left many civilians in the occupied areas defenseless against the invading armies of the Balkan League. Although there are discussions about the exact amount of civilian casualties, when the war ended great changes occurred in the demographic makeup of the Balkan region.

== Background ==
Tensions among the Balkan states over their rival aspirations to the provinces of Ottoman-controlled Rumelia (Eastern Rumelia, Thrace and Macedonia) subsided somewhat after the mid-19th-century intervention by the Great Powers, which aimed to secure both more complete protection for the provinces&#x27; Christian majority as well as to maintain the status quo. By 1867, Serbia and Montenegro had both secured their independence, which was confirmed by the Treaty of Berlin (1878). The question of the viability of Ottoman rule was revived after the Young Turk Revolution in July 1908, which compelled the Ottoman Sultan to restore the suspended constitution of the empire.

Serbia&#x27;s aspirations to take over Bosnia and Herzegovina were thwarted by the Bosnian crisis, which led to the Austrian annexation of the province in October 1908. The Serbs then directed their war efforts to the south. After the annexation, the Young Turks tried to induce the Muslim population of Bosnia to emigrate to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman authorities resettled those who took up the offer in districts of northern Macedonia with few Muslims. The experiment proved to be a catastrophe since the immigrants readily united with the existing population of Albanian Muslims and participated in the series of 1911 Albanian uprisings and the Albanian revolt of 1912. Some Albanian government troops switched sides.

In May 1912, Albanian rebels seeking national autonomy and the re-installment of Sultan Abdul Hamid II to power drove the Young Turkish forces out of Skopje and pressed south towards Manastir (now Bitola), forcing the Young Turks to grant effective autonomy over large regions in June 1912. Serbia, which had been helping to arm the Hamidian and Catholic Albanians rebelling in the Mirditë region; sent secret agents to some of the prominent leaders, taking the revolt as a pretext for war. Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria had all been in talks about possible offensives against the Ottoman Empire before the 1912 Albanian revolt had broken out, and a formal agreement between Serbia and Montenegro had been signed on 7 March. On 18 October 1912, King Peter I of Serbia issued a declaration, &#x27;To the Serbian People,&#x27; which appeared to support Albanians as well as Serbs:

In a search for allies, Serbia was ready to negotiate a treaty with Bulgaria. The agreement provided that in the event of victory against the Ottomans, Bulgaria would receive all of Macedonia south of the Kriva Palanka–Ohrid line. Bulgaria accepted Serbia&#x27;s expansion as being to the north of the Shar Mountains (Kosovo). The intervening area was agreed to be &quot;disputed&quot; and would be arbitrated by the Tsar of Russia in the event of a successful war against the Ottoman Empire. During the war, it became apparent that the Albanians did not consider Serbia as a liberator, as had been suggested by King Peter I, and the Serbian forces failed to observe his declaration of amity toward Albanians.

After the successful coup d&#x27;état for unification with Eastern Rumelia, Bulgaria began to dream that its national unification would be realized. For that purpose, it developed a large army and was identified as the &quot;Prussia of the Balkans.&quot; However, Bulgaria could not win a war alone against the Ottomans.

In Greece, Hellenic Army officers had rebelled in the Goudi coup of August 1909 and secured the appointment of a progressive government under Eleftherios Venizelos, which they hoped would resolve the Crete question in Greece&#x27;s favour. They also wanted to reverse their defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1897) by the Ottomans. An emergency military reorganization, led by a French military mission, had been started for that purpose, but its work was interrupted by the outbreak of war in the Balkans. In the discussions that led to Greece joining the Balkan League, Bulgaria refused to commit to any agreement on distributing territorial gains, unlike its deal with Serbia over Macedonia. Bulgaria&#x27;s diplomatic policy was to push Serbia into one that limited its access to Macedonia while simultaneously refusing any such agreement with Greece. Bulgaria believed that its army could occupy the big part of Aegean Macedonia and the port city of Salonica (Thessaloniki) before the Greeks could do so.

In 1911, Italy had launched an invasion of Tripolitania, now in Libya, which was quickly followed by the occupation of the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea. The Italians&#x27; decisive military victories over the Ottoman Empire and the successful 1912 Albanian revolt encouraged the Balkan states to imagine that they might win a war against the Ottomans. By the spring and summer of 1912, the various Christian Balkan nations had created a network of military alliances, becoming known as the Balkan League.

The Great Powers, most notably France and Austria-Hungary, reacted to the formation of the alliances by trying unsuccessfully to dissuade the Balkan League from going to war. In late September, the League and the Ottoman Empire mobilized their armies. Montenegro was the first to declare war on 25 September (O.S.)/8 October. After issuing an impossible ultimatum to the Ottoman Porte on 13 October, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece declared war on the Ottomans on 17 October (1912). The declarations of war attracted a large number of war correspondents. An estimated 200 to 300 journalists from around the world covered the war in the Balkans in November 1912.

== Order of battle and plans ==

Due to poor organization, transportation problems and the protracted war with Italy, the Ottoman order of battle only had 12,024 officers, 324,718 other ranks, 47,960 animals, 2,318 artillery pieces and 388 machine guns ready by early October instead of the planned full complement of 750,000 officers and soldiers. A total of 920 officers and 42,607 men of them had been assigned to non-divisional units and services, the remaining 293,206 officers and men were assigned to four armies.

Opposing them and continuing their secret prewar settlements for expansion, the three Slavic allies (Bulgarian, Serbs and Montenegrins) had extensive plans to co-ordinate their war efforts: the Serbs and the Montenegrins in the theatre of Sandžak and the Bulgarians and the Serbs in the Macedonian and the Bulgarians alone in the Thracian theatre.

The bulk of the Bulgarian forces (346,182 men) was to attack Thrace, fighting against the Thracian Ottoman Army of 96,273 men and about 26,000 garrison troops, or about 115,000 personnel in total, according to Hall&#x27;s, Erickson&#x27;s and the Turkish General Staff&#x27;s 1993 studies. It was to be supported by the Kırcaali Detachment of 24,000 military personnel, deployed along the Arda river to prevent the Bulgarians from reaching the Aegean Sea and thus cutting Ottoman transportation and communication links with Macedonia.

The Vardar Army of some 58,000 men was deployed near Kumanovo against the First and Second Serbian Armies of 90,000 Serbian and approx. 50,000 Serbian and Bulgarian men. Approx. 28,000 additional men from the Struma Corps were to protect the right flank of the Vardar Army and prevent Bulgarian encroachment along the Struma.

The Yanya Corps (22,000 men) was to defend Epirus and Albania from the Greek Army of Epirus, while the VIII Corps (29,000 men) was deployed to guard the Thessalian mountain passes leading to Thessaloniki. Additional 25,000 men of the Işkodra Corps were stationed in Shkodër to protect Northern Albania. Thus, the Ottoman military personnel stationed in Macedonia, Kosovo, Albania and Epirus numbered almost 200,000 men, who were pitted against 234,000 Serbs, 48,000 Bulgarians and 115,000 Greeks.

=== Bulgaria ===

Bulgaria was militarily the most powerful of the four Balkan states, with a large, well-trained, well-equipped army. Bulgaria mobilized a total of 599,878 men out of a population of 4.3 million. The Bulgarian field army counted for nine infantry divisions, one cavalry division and 1,116 artillery units. The commander-in-chief was Tsar Ferdinand, and the operating command was in the hands of his deputy, General Mihail Savov. The Bulgarians also had a small navy of six torpedo boats restricted to operations along the country&#x27;s Black Sea coast.

Bulgaria was focused on actions in Thrace and Macedonia. It deployed its main force in Thrace by forming three armies. The First Army (79,370 men), under General Vasil Kutinchev, had three infantry divisions and was deployed to the south of Yambol and assigned operations along the Tundzha River. The Second Army (122,748 men), under General Nikola Ivanov, with two infantry divisions and one infantry brigade, was deployed west of the First Army and was assigned to capture the strong fortress of Adrianople (Edirne). Plans had the Third Army (94,884 men), under General Radko Dimitriev, to be deployed east of and behind the First Army and to be covered by the cavalry division that hid it from the Ottomans&#x27; sight. The Third Army had three infantry divisions and was assigned to cross Mount Stranja and to take the fortress of Kirk Kilisse (Kırklareli). The 2nd (49,180) and 7th (48,523 men) Divisions were assigned independent roles, operating in Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia, respectively.

==== Armenian volunteers ====
Three hundred Armenians from throughout the Ottoman Empire, Europe, and Russia, a small yet significant number, volunteered to fight on the side of the Balkan League&#x27;s soldiers of more than 850,000. Under the leadership of Andranik Ozanian and Garegin Nzhdeh, the Armenian detachment was commissioned to fight the Ottomans first at Momchilgrad and Komotini and its environs, and then later İpsala, Keşan, and Malkara, and Tekirdağ.

=== Serbia ===

Serbia called upon about 255,000 men, out of a population of 2,912,000, with about 228 heavy guns, grouped in ten infantry divisions, two independent brigades and a cavalry division, under the effective command of the former war minister, Radomir Putnik. The Serbian High Command, in its prewar war games, had concluded that the most likely site for the decisive battle against the Ottoman Vardar Army would be on the Ovče Pole Plateau, ahead of Skopje. Thus, the main forces were formed as three armies for the advance towards Skopje, and a division and an independent brigade were to cooperate with the Montenegrins in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar.

The First Army (132,000 men), the strongest, was commanded by Crown Prince Alexander, and the Chief of Staff was Colonel Petar Bojović. The First Army formed the centre of the drive towards Skopje. The Second Army (74,000 men) was commanded by General Stepa Stepanović and had one Serbian and one Bulgarian (7th Rila) division. It formed the army&#x27;s left wing and advanced towards Stracin. Though the inclusion of a Bulgarian division was according to a prewar arrangement between Serbian and Bulgarian armies, it ceased to obey the orders of Stepanović as soon as the war began, only following those of the Bulgarian High Command. The Third Army (76,000 men) was commanded by General Božidar Janković, and since it was on the right wing, had the task to invade Kosovo and then move south to join the other armies in the expected battle at Ovče Polje. There were two more concentrations in northwestern Serbia across the borders between Serbia and Austria-Hungary: the Ibar Army (25,000 men), under General Mihailo Živković, and the Javor Brigade (12,000 men), under Lieutenant-Colonel Milovoje Anđelković.

=== Greece ===
Greece, whose population was then 2,666,000, was considered the weakest of the three main allies since it fielded the smallest army and had suffered a defeat against the Ottomans 16 years earlier, in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. A British consular dispatch from 1910 expressed the common perception of the Greek army&#x27;s abilities: &quot;If there is a war, we shall probably see that the only thing Greek officers can do besides talking is to run away.&quot; However, Greece was the only Balkan country to possess a meaningful navy, which was vital to the League to prevent Ottoman reinforcements from being rapidly transferred by ship from Asia to Europe. The Serbs and the Bulgarians readily appreciated it as the chief factor in initiating the process of Greece&#x27;s inclusion in the League. As the Greek ambassador to Sofia put it during the negotiations that led to Greece&#x27;s entry into the League, &quot;Greece can provide 600,000 men for the war effort. With 200,000 men on the battlefield, the fleet will be able to prevent 400,000 men from being landed by Turkey between Salonica and Gallipoli.&quot;

The Greek army was still undergoing reorganization by a French military mission, which arrived in early 1911. Under French supervision, the Greeks had adopted the triangular infantry division as their primary formation though more importantly, the overhaul of the mobilization system allowed the country to field and equip a far greater number of troops than had been the case in 1897. Foreign observers estimated Greece would mobilize approximately 50,000 men, but the Greek army fielded 125,000, with another 140,000 in the National Guard and reserves. Upon mobilization, as in 1897, the force was grouped in two field armies, reflecting the geographic division between the two operational theatres that were open to the Greeks: Thessaly and Epirus. The Army of Thessaly (Στρατιά Θεσσαλίας) was placed under Crown Prince Constantine, with Lieutenant-General Panagiotis Danglis as his chief of staff. It fielded the bulk of the Greek forces: seven infantry divisions, a cavalry regiment, and four independent Evzones light mountain infantry battalions, roughly 100,000 men. It was expected to overcome the fortified Ottoman border positions and advance towards southern and central Macedonia, aiming to take Thessaloniki and Bitola. The remaining 10,000 to 13,000 men in eight battalions were assigned to the Army of Epirus () under Lieutenant-General Konstantinos Sapountzakis. As it had no hope of capturing Ioannina, the heavily fortified capital of Epirus, the initial mission was to pin down the Ottoman forces there until sufficient reinforcements could be sent from the Army of Thessaly after the successful conclusion of operations.
The Greek navy was relatively modern, strengthened by the recent purchase of numerous new units and undergoing reforms under the supervision of a British mission. Invited by Greek Prime Minister Venizelos in 1910, the mission began its work upon its arrival in May 1911. Granted extraordinary powers and led by Vice Admiral Lionel Grant Tufnell, it thoroughly reorganized the Navy Ministry and dramatically improved the number and the quality of exercises in gunnery and fleet maneuvers. In 1912, the core unit of the fleet was the fast armoured cruiser &quot;Georgios Averof&quot;, which had been completed in 1910 and then was the fastest and the most modern warship in the combatant navies. It was complemented by three rather-antiquated battleships of the . There were also eight destroyers, built in 1906–1907, and six new destroyers, hastily bought in the summer of 1912 as the imminence of war became apparent.

Nevertheless, at the outbreak of the war, the Greek fleet was far from ready. The Ottoman battlefleet retained a clear advantage in the number of ships, speed of the primary surface units and, most importantly, the number and calibre of the ships&#x27; guns. In addition, as the war caught the fleet in the middle of its expansion and reorganization, a full third of the fleet (the six new destroyers and the submarine ) reached Greece only after hostilities had started, forcing the navy to reshuffle crews, who consequently suffered from lacking familiarity and training. Coal stockpiles and other war stores were also in short supply, and the &quot;Georgios Averof&quot; had arrived with barely any ammunition and remained so until late November.

=== Montenegro ===
Montenegro was the smallest nation in the Balkan Peninsula, but in recent years before the war, it had improved its military skills with support from Russia. Also, it was the only Balkan country never to be fully conquered by the Ottoman Empire. As the smallest member of the League, Montenegro did not have much influence. However, it was advantageous for Montenegro, since when the Ottoman Empire was trying to counter the actions of Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece, there was enough time for Montenegro to prepare, which helped its successful military campaign.

=== Ottoman Empire ===
Known colloquially as &quot;the sick man of Europe&quot;, by 1912, the Ottoman Empire was at the end stages of a centuries long decline. Upon the outbreak of war Turkish forces were extremely vulnerable. The Ottoman Empire itself possessed a far larger population than all of its adversaries combined, of around 26 million. However just over 6.1 million lived in what still remained of Ottoman Europe, of which only 2.3 million were Muslim. A majority of the remainder were Orthodox Christians, considered unfit for conscription. The poor transport network of the Empire&#x27;s Asian regions dictated that the only reliable way to mass transfer troops to the front was by sea where they&#x27;d be vulnerable to attacks from the Greek fleet based in the Aegean. In addition, in 1912 Ottomans were still at war with the Italians who in the year proceeding had overrun Ottoman Libya and by now were invading the Dodecanese islands, a campaign which had dominated Ottoman military efforts. Though the Ottoman Empire and Italy made peace on 15 October 1912, only days after the outbreak of hostilities in the Balkans, the protracted war had prevented the Ottomans from reinforcing their position in the Balkans as their relations with the Balkan states deteriorated.

==== Forces in Balkans ====

The Ottomans&#x27; military capabilities were hampered by several factors, such as domestic strife caused by the Young Turk Revolution and the counterrevolutionary coup several months later. That resulted in different groups competing for influence within the military. A German mission had tried reorganizing the army, but its recommendations had not been fully implemented. The Ottoman army was caught in the middle of reform and reorganization. Also, several of the army&#x27;s best battalions had been transferred to Yemen to face the ongoing rebellion. In the summer of 1912, the Ottoman High Command decided disastrously to dismiss some 70,000 mobilized troops. Though the regular army (&quot;Nizam&quot;) was well-equipped and had trained active divisions, the reserve units (&quot;Redif&quot;) that reinforced it was ill-equipped, especially in artillery, and badly-trained.

The Ottomans&#x27; strategic situation was difficult, as their borders were almost impossible to defend against a coordinated attack by the Balkan states. The Ottoman leadership decided to secure all of their territory. As a result, the available forces, which could not be effortlessly reinforced from Asia because of Greek control of the sea and the inadequacy of the Ottoman railway system, were dispersed too thinly across the region. They failed to stand up to the rapidly-mobilized Balkan armies. The Ottomans had three in Europe (the Macedonian, Vardar and Thracian Armies), with 1,203 pieces of mobile and 1,115 fixed artillery in fortified areas. The Ottoman High Command repeated its error of previous wars by ignoring the established command structure to create new superior commands, the Eastern Army and Western Army, reflecting the division of the operational theatre between the Thracian (against the Bulgarians) and Macedonian (against the Greeks, Serbs and Montenegrins) fronts.

The Western Army fielded at least 200,000 men, and the Eastern Army fielded 115,000 men against the Bulgarians. The Eastern Army was commanded by Nazim Pasha and had seven corps of 11 regular infantry divisions, 13 Redif divisions and at least one cavalry division:
*I Corps with three divisions (2nd Infantry (minus regiment), 3rd Infantry and 1st Provisional divisions).
*II Corps with three divisions (4th (minus regiment) and 5th Infantry and Uşak Redif divisions).
*III Corps with four divisions (7th, 8th and 9th Infantry Divisions, all minus a regiment, and the Afyonkarahisar Redif Division).
*IV Corps with three divisions (12th Infantry Division (minus regiment), İzmit and Bursa Redif divisions).
*XVII Corps with three divisions (Samsun, Ereğli and İzmir Redif divisions).
*Edirne Fortified Area with six-plus divisions (10th and 11th Infantry, Edirne, Babaeski and Gümülcine Redif and the Fortress division, 4th Rifle and 12th Cavalry regiments).
*Kırcaali Detachment with two-plus divisions (Kırcaali Redif, Kırcaali Mustahfız division and 36th Infantry Regiment).
*An independent cavalry division and the 5th Light Cavalry Brigade.

The Western Army (Macedonian and Vardar Army) constituted ten corps with 32 infantry and two cavalry divisions. Against Serbia, the Ottomans deployed the Vardar Army (HQ in Skopje) under Halepli Zeki Pasha, with five corps of 18 infantry divisions, one cavalry division and two independent cavalry brigades under the:
*V Corps with four divisions (13th, 15th, 16th Infantry and the İştip Redif divisions)
*VI Corps with four divisions (17th, 18th Infantry and the Manastır and Drama Redif divisions)
*VII Corps with three division (19th Infantry and Üsküp and Priştine Redif divisions)
*II Corps with three divisions (Uşak, Denizli and İzmir Redif divisions)
*Sandžak Corps with four divisions (20th Infantry (minus regiment), 60th Infantry, Metroviça Redif Division, Taşlıca Redif Regiment, Firzovik and Taslica detachments)
*An independent Cavalry Division and the 7th and 8th Cavalry Brigades.

The Macedonian Army (headquarters in Thessaloniki under Ali Rıza Pasha) had 14 divisions in five corps, deployed against Greece, Bulgaria and Montenegro.

Against Greece, at least seven divisions were deployed:
*VIII Provisional Corps with three divisions (22nd Infantry and Nasliç and Aydın Redif divisions).
*Yanya Corps with three divisions (23rd Infantry, Yanya Redif and Bizani Fortress divisions).
*Selanik Redif division and Karaburun Detachment as independent units.

Against Bulgaria, in southeastern Macedonia, two divisions, the Struma Corps (14th Infantry and Serez Redif divisions, plus the Nevrekop Detachment), were deployed.

Against Montenegro, four-plus divisions were deployed:
*İşkodra Corps with two-plus divisions (24th Infantry, Elbasan Redif, İşkodra Fortified Area)
*İpek Detachment with two divisions (21st Infantry and Prizren Redif divisions)

According to the organizational plan, though the men of the Western Group were to total 598,000, slow mobilization and the inefficiency of the rail system drastically reduced the number of men available. According to the Western Army Staff, when the war began, it had only 200,000 men available. Although more men would reach their units, war casualties prevented the Western Group from coming near its nominal strength. In wartime, the Ottomans had planned to bring more troops in from Syria, both &quot;Nizamiye&quot; and &quot;Redif&quot;. Greek naval supremacy prevented those reinforcements from arriving. Instead, those soldiers had to deploy via the land route, and most never made it to the Balkans.

The Ottoman General Staff, assisted by the German military mission, developed twelve war plans designed to counter various combinations of opponents. Work on Plan No. 5, which was against Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Montenegro, was very advanced and had been sent to the army staff for them to develop local plans.

==== Ottoman Navy ====

The Ottoman fleet had performed abysmally in the 1897 Greco-Turkish War, forcing the Ottoman government to begin a drastic overhaul. Older ships were retired, and newer ones were acquired, chiefly from France and Germany. In addition, in 1908, the Ottomans called in a British naval mission to update their training and doctrine. The British mission, headed by Admiral Sir Douglas Gamble, would find its task almost impossible. The political upheaval in the aftermath of the Young Turk Revolution prevented it to a large extent. Between 1908 and 1911, the office of the Navy Minister changed hands nine times. Interdepartmental infighting and the entrenched interests of the bloated and averaged officer corps, many of whom occupied their positions as quasi-sinecure, further obstructed drastic reform. In addition, the Ottoman ministers met the British attempts to control the navy&#x27;s construction programme with suspicion. Consequently, funds for Gamble&#x27;s ambitious plans for new ships were unavailable.

To counter the Greek acquisition of the &quot;Georgios Averof&quot;, the Ottomans initially tried to buy the new German armoured cruiser or the battlecruiser . Not able to afford the ships&#x27; high cost, the Ottomans acquired two old pre-dreadnought battleships, which became and . Along with the cruisers and , both ships were to form the relatively modern core of the Ottoman battlefleet. By the summer of 1912, however, they were already in poor condition because of chronic neglect: the rangefinders and ammunition hoists had been removed, the telephones were not working, the pumps were corroded, and most of the watertight doors could no longer be closed.

=== Albanian volunteers and irregulars in the Ottoman army ===
During the onset of the First Balkan War, most Albanians, including frequent rebels like Isa Boletin, united to defend the Ottoman Empire in order to safeguard their Albanian territories. Without a centralized national structure, Albanians were compelled to depend on Ottoman establishments, its military, and its administration to shield them from partition. However, all three proved inadequate against the onslaught of four invading Balkan armies. Even following the signing of the armistice in December 1912, Ottoman regular troops, along with Albanian irregular forces, persisted in central and southern Albania.

== Operations ==
=== Bulgarian theatre ===
Montenegro started the First Balkan War by declaring war against the Ottomans on . The western part of the Balkans, including Albania, Kosovo, and Macedonia, was less vital to the resolution of the war and the survival of the Ottoman Empire than the Thracian theatre, where the Bulgarians fought significant battles against the Ottomans. Although geography dictated Thrace would be the primary battlefield in a war with the Ottoman Empire, the position of the Ottoman Army there was jeopardized by erroneous intelligence estimates of the opponents&#x27; order of battle. Unaware of the secret prewar political and military settlement over Macedonia between Bulgaria and Serbia, the Ottoman leadership assigned the bulk of its forces there. The German ambassador, Hans Baron von Wangenheim, one of the most influential people in the Ottoman capital, had reported to Berlin on 21 October that the Ottoman forces believed that the bulk of the Bulgarian army would be deployed in Macedonia with the Serbs. Then, the Ottoman headquarters, under Abdullah Pasha, expected to meet only three Bulgarian infantry divisions, accompanied by cavalry, east of Adrianople. According to historian E. J. Erickson, though that assumption possibly resulted from the analysis of the objectives of the Balkan Pact, it had deadly consequences for the Ottoman Army in Thrace, which was now required to defend the area from the bulk of the Bulgarian army against impossible odds. The misappraisal was also the reason for the catastrophic aggressive Ottoman strategy at the start of the campaign in Thrace.

====Bulgarian offensive and advance to Çatalca====
On the Thracian Front, the Bulgarian army had placed 346,182 men against the Ottoman First Army, with 105,000 men in eastern Thrace and the Kircaali detachment, of 24,000 men, in western Thrace. The Bulgarian forces were divided into the First, Second and Third Bulgarian Armies of 297,002 men in the eastern part and 49,180 (33,180 regulars and 16,000 irregulars) under the 2nd Bulgarian Division (General Stilian Kovachev) in the western part. The first large-scale battle occurred against the Edirne-Kırklareli defensive line, where the Bulgarian First and Third Armies (a combined 174,254 men) defeated the Ottoman East Army (of 96,273 combatants), near Gechkenli, Seliolu and Petra. The Ottoman XV Corps urgently left the area to defend the Gallipoli Peninsula against an expected Greek amphibious assault, which never materialized. The absence of the corps created an immediate vacuum between Adrianople and Demotika, and the 11th Infantry Division from the Eastern Army&#x27;s IV Corps was moved there to replace it. Thus, one complete army corps was removed from the Eastern Army&#x27;s order of battle.

As a consequence of the insufficient intelligence of the invading forces, the Ottoman offensive plan failed in the face of Bulgarian superiority. That forced Kölemen Abdullah Pasha to abandon Kirk Kilisse, which was taken without resistance by the Bulgarian Third Army. The fortress of Adrianople, with some 61,250 men, was isolated and besieged by the Bulgarian Second Army, but for the time being, no assault was possible because of the lack of siege equipment in the Bulgarian inventory. Another consequence of Greek naval supremacy in the Aegean was that the Ottoman forces did not receive the reinforcements that had been in the war plans, which would have been further corps transferred by sea from Syria and Palestine. Thus, the Greek navy played an indirect but crucial role in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing three corps, a significant portion of the Ottoman army, in the all-important opening round of the war. Another more direct role was the emergency transportation of the Bulgarian 7th Rila Division from the Macedonian Front to the Thracian Front after the end of operations there.

After the Battle of Kirk Kilisse, the Bulgarian High Command decided to wait a few days, but that allowed the Ottoman forces to occupy a new defensive position on the Lüleburgaz-Karaağaç-Pınarhisar line. However, the Bulgarian attack by the First and Third Armies, which together accounted for 107,386 riflemen, 3,115 cavalries, 116 machine guns and 360 artillery pieces, defeated the reinforced Ottoman Army, with 126,000 riflemen, 3,500 cavalries, 96 machine guns, and 342 artillery pieces and reached the Sea of Marmara. In terms of forces engaged, it was the largest battle fought in Europe between the end of the Franco-Prussian War and the beginning of the First World War. As a result, the Ottoman forces were pushed to their final defensive position across the Çatalca Line, protecting the peninsula and Constantinople. There, they managed to stabilize the front with the help of fresh reinforcements from Asia. The line had been constructed during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-8, under the directions of a German engineer in Ottoman service, von Bluhm Pasha, but it had been considered obsolete by 1912. An epidemic of cholera spread among the Bulgarian soldiers after the Battle of Luleburgas - Bunarhisar.
Meanwhile, the Bulgarian 2nd Thracian division&#x27;s forces, 49,180 men divided into the Haskovo and Rhodope detachments, advanced towards the Aegean Sea. The Ottoman Kircaali detachment (Kircaali Redif and Kircaali Mustahfiz Divisions and 36th Regiment, with 24,000 men), tasked with defending a front across the Thessaloniki-Alexandroupoli railroad, failed to offer serious resistance and the commander, Yaver Pasha, was captured with 10,131 officers and men by the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps on 26 November. After the occupation of Thessaloniki by the Greek army, his surrender completed the isolation of the Ottoman forces in Macedonia from those in Thrace.

On , the offensive against the Çatalca Line began, despite clear warnings that Russia would attack the Bulgarians if they occupied Constantinople. The Bulgarians launched their attack along the defensive line, with 176,351 men and 462 artillery pieces against the Ottomans&#x27; 140,571 men and 316 artillery pieces, but despite Bulgarian superiority, the Ottomans succeeded in repulsing them. The Ottomans and Bulgaria agreed to negotiate on , the latter representing Serbia and Montenegro, and peace negotiations began in London. Greece also participated in the conference but refused to agree to a truce and continued its operations in the Epirus sector. They were interrupted on , when a Young Turk coup d&#x27;état in Constantinople, under Enver Pasha, overthrew the government of Kâmil Pasha. Upon the expiration of the agreement, on , hostilities restarted.

==== Ottoman counteroffensive ====

On 20 February, Ottoman forces attacked Gallipoli in Çatalca and its south. There, the Ottoman X Corps, with 19,858 men and 48 guns, landed at Şarköy while an attack of around 15,000 men supported by 36 guns (part of the 30,000-strong Ottoman army isolated in Gallipoli Peninsula) at Bulair, farther south. Both attacks were supported by fire from Ottoman warships and had been intended, in the long term, to relieve pressure on Edirne. Confronting them were about 10,000 men with 78 guns. The Ottomans were probably unaware of the presence in the area of the new 4th Bulgarian Army, of 92,289 men, under General Stiliyan Kovachev. Thick fog, intense Bulgarian artillery, and machine gunfire hampered the Ottoman attack in the thin isthmus, with a front of just 1800m. As a result, the attack stalled and was repulsed by a Bulgarian counterattack. By the end of the day, both armies had returned to their original positions. Meanwhile, the Ottoman X Corps, which had landed at Şarköy, advanced until , when the reinforcements sent by General Kovachev succeeded in halting them.

Casualties on both sides were light. After the frontal attack in Bulair&#x27;s failure, the Ottoman forces at Şarköy re-entered their ships on and were transported to Gallipoli.

The Ottoman attack at Çatalca, directed against the powerful Bulgarian First and Third Armies, was initially launched only as a diversion from the Gallipoli-Şarköy operation to pin down the Bulgarian forces in situ. Nevertheless, it resulted in unexpected success. The Bulgarians, who were weakened by cholera and concerned that an Ottoman amphibious invasion might endanger their armies, deliberately withdrew about and to the south over to their secondary defensive positions, on higher ground to the west. With the end of the attack in Gallipoli, though the Ottomans cancelled the operation since they were reluctant to leave the Çatalca Line, several days passed before the Bulgarians realized that the offensive had ended. By 15 February, the front had again stabilized, but fighting along the static lines continued. The battle, which resulted in heavy Bulgarian casualties, could be characterized as an Ottoman tactical victory but a strategic defeat since it did nothing to prevent the failure of the Gallipoli-Şarköy operation or to relieve the pressure on Edirne.

==== Fall of Adrianople and Serbo-Bulgarian friction ====
The failure of the Şarköy-Bulair operation and the deployment of the Second Serbian Army, with its much-needed heavy siege artillery, sealed Adrianople&#x27;s fate. On 11 March, after a two weeks bombardment, which destroyed many fortified structures around the city, the final assault started, with League forces enjoying a crushing superiority over the Ottoman garrison. The Bulgarian Second Army, with 106,425 men and two Serbian divisions, with 47,275 men, conquered the city, with the Bulgarians suffering 8,093 and the Serbs 1,462 casualties. The Ottoman casualties for the entire Adrianople campaign reached 23,000 dead. The number of prisoners is less clear. The Ottoman Empire began the war with 61,250 men in the fortress. Richard Hall noted that 60,000 men were captured. Adding to the 33,000 killed, the modern &quot;Turkish General Staff History&quot; notes that 28,500-man survived captivity leaving 10,000 men unaccounted for as possibly captured (including the unspecified number of wounded). Bulgarian losses for the entire Adrianople campaign amounted to 7,682. That was the last and decisive battle that was necessary for a quick end to the war even though it is speculated that the fortress would have fallen eventually because of starvation. The most important result was that the Ottoman command had lost all hope of regaining the initiative, which made any more fighting pointless.

The battle had significant results in Serbian-Bulgarian relations, planting the seeds of the two countries&#x27; confrontation some months later. The Bulgarian censor rigorously cut any references to Serbian participation in the operation in the telegrams of foreign correspondents. Public opinion in Sofia thus failed to realize the vital services of Serbia in the battle. Accordingly, the Serbs claimed that their troops of the 20th Regiment captured the Ottoman commander of the city and that Colonel Gavrilović was the allied commander who had accepted Shukri&#x27;s official surrender of the garrison, a statement that the Bulgarians disputed. The Serbs officially protested and pointed out that although they had sent their troops to Adrianople to win for Bulgaria&#x27;s territory, whose acquisition had never been foreseen by their mutual treaty, the Bulgarians had never fulfilled the clause of the treaty for Bulgaria to send 100,000 men to help the Serbians on their Vardar Front. The Bulgarians answered that their staff had informed the Serbs on 23 August. The friction escalated some weeks later when the Bulgarian delegates in London bluntly warned the Serbs that they must not expect Bulgarian support for their Adriatic claims. The Serbs angrily replied that it was a blatant withdrawal from the prewar agreement of mutual understanding, according to the Kriva Palanka-Adriatic line of expansion. The Bulgarians insisted that the Vardar Macedonian part of the agreement remained active, and the Serbs were still obliged to surrender the area, as had been agreed. The Serbs answered by accusing the Bulgarians of maximalism and pointed out that if they lost both northern Albania and Vardar Macedonia, their participation in the common war would have been virtually for nothing. The tension soon was expressed in a series of hostile incidents between both armies on their mutual line of occupation across the Vardar valley. The developments essentially ended the Serbian-Bulgarian alliance, making a future war between the two countries inevitable.

===Greek theatre===
====Macedonian front====
Ottoman intelligence had also disastrously misread Greek military intentions. In retrospect, the Ottoman staff seemingly believed that the Greek attack would be shared equally between Macedonia and Epirus. That made the Second Army staff evenly balance the combat strength of the seven Ottoman divisions between the Yanya Corps and VIII Corps in Epirus and southern Macedonia, respectively. Though the Greek army also fielded seven divisions, it had the initiative, so it concentrated all seven against VIII Corps, leaving only several independent battalions of scarcely divisional strength on the Epirus front. That had fatal consequences for the Western Group by leading to the early loss of the city at the strategic centre of all three Macedonian fronts (Thessaloniki), sealing their fate. In an unexpectedly brilliant and rapid campaign, the Army of Thessaly seized the city. In the absence of secure sea lines of communications, retaining the Thessaloniki-Constantinople corridor was essential to the overall strategic posture of the Ottomans in the Balkans. Once that was gone, the defeat of the Ottoman army became inevitable, in which the Bulgarians and the Serbs also played a vital role. Their great victories at Kirkkilise, Lüleburgaz, Kumanovo, and Monastir (Bitola) shattered the Eastern and Vardar Armies. However, they were not decisive in ending the war. The Ottoman field armies survived, and in Thrace, they grew stronger every day. Strategically, those victories were enabled partially by the weakened condition of the Ottoman armies, which had occurred by the active presence of the Greek army and navy.

With the declaration of war, the Greek Army of Thessaly, under Crown Prince Constantine, advanced to the north and overcame Ottoman opposition in the fortified mountain passes of Sarantaporo. After another victory at Giannitsa (Yenidje), on , the Ottoman commander, Hasan Tahsin Pasha, surrendered Thessaloniki and its garrison of 26,000 men to the Greeks on . Two Corps headquarters (Ustruma and VIII), two Nizamiye divisions (14th and 22nd) and four Redif divisions (Salonika, Drama, Naslic and Serez) were thus lost to the Ottoman order of battle. Also, the Ottoman forces lost 70 artillery pieces, 30 machine guns and 70,000 rifles (Thessaloniki was the central arms depot for the Western Armies). The Ottoman forces estimated that 15,000 officers and men had been killed during the campaign in southern Macedonia, bringing their total losses to 41,000 soldiers. Another consequence was that the destruction of the Macedonian army sealed the fate of the Ottoman Vardar Army, which was fighting the Serbs to the north. The fall of Thessaloniki left it strategically isolated, without logistical supply and depth to maneuver, and ensured its destruction.

Upon learning of the outcome of the Battle of Giannitsa (Yenidje), the Bulgarian High Command urgently dispatched the 7th &quot;Rila&quot; Division from the north towards the city. The division arrived there a day later, after surrendering to the Greeks the day before, who were further away from the city than the Bulgarians. Until 10 November, the Greek-occupied zone had been expanded to the line from Lake Dojran to the Pangaion hills west to Kavalla. In western Macedonia, however, the lack of coordination between the Greek and the Serbian headquarters cost the Greeks a setback in the Battle of Vevi, on , when the Greek 5th Infantry Division crossed its way with the VI Ottoman Corps (part of the Vardar Army with the 16th, 17th and 18th Nizamiye Divisions), retreating to Albania after the Battle of Prilep against the Serbs. The Greek division, surprised by the presence of the Ottoman Corps, isolated from the rest of the Greek army and outnumbered by the now-counterattacking Ottomans centred on Monastir (Bitola), was forced to retreat. As a result, the Serbs beat the Greeks to Bitola.

====Epirus front====
In the Epirus front, the Greek army was initially heavily outnumbered, but the passive attitude of the Ottomans let the Greeks conquer Preveza on 21 October 1912 and push north towards Ioannina. On 5 November, Major Spyros Spyromilios led a revolt in the coastal area of Himarë and expelled the Ottoman garrison without any significant resistance, and on 20 November, Greek troops from western Macedonia entered Korçë. However, Greek forces in the Epirote front lacked the numbers to initiate an offensive against the German-designed defensive positions of Bizani, which protected Ioannina and needed to wait for reinforcements from the Macedonian front.

After the campaign in Macedonia was over, a large part of the Army was redeployed to Epirus, where Constantine assumed command. In the Battle of Bizani, the Ottoman positions were breached, and Ioannina was taken on . During the siege, on 8 February 1913, the Russian pilot N. de Sackoff, flying for the Greeks, became the first pilot ever shot down in combat when his biplane was hit by ground fire after a bomb ran on the walls of Fort Bizani. He came down near the small town of Preveza, on the coast north of the Ionian island of Lefkas, secured local Greek assistance, repaired his plane and resumed flying back to base. The fall of Ioannina allowed the Greek army to continue its advance into northern Epirus, now the south of Albania, which it occupied. There they halted, but the Serbian control was very close to the north.

===Naval operations===

On the outbreak of hostilities on 18 October, the Greek fleet, placed under the newly promoted Rear Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, sailed for the island of Lemnos, occupying it three days later (although fighting continued on the island until 27 October) and establishing an anchorage at Moudros Bay. That move had significant strategic importance by providing the Greeks with a forward base near the Dardanelles Straits, the Ottoman fleet&#x27;s main anchorage and refuge. The Ottoman fleet&#x27;s superiority in speed and broadside weight made Greek plans expect it to sortie from the straits early in the war. The Greek fleet&#x27;s unpreparedness because of the early outbreak of the war might as well have let such an early Ottoman attack achieve a crucial victory. Instead, the Ottoman navy spent the first two months of the war in operations against the Bulgarians in the Black Sea, which gave the Greeks valuable time to complete their preparations and allowed them to consolidate their control of the Aegean Sea.

====Establishment of Greek control of the Aegean====
Lieutenant Nikolaos Votsis scored a significant success for Greek morale on 21 October by sailing his torpedo boat No. 11, in the cover of night, into the harbour of Thessaloniki, sinking the old Ottoman ironclad battleship and escaping unharmed. On the same day, Greek troops of the Epirus Army seized the Ottoman naval base of Preveza. Though the Ottomans scuttled the four ships present there, the Greeks were able to salvage the Italian-built torpedo-boats and , which were commissioned into the Greek Navy as and , respectively. A few days later, on 9 November, the wooden Ottoman armed steamer &quot;Trabzon&quot; was intercepted and sunk by the Greek torpedo boat No. 14, under Lieutenant-General Periklis Argyropoulos, of Ayvalık.
By mid-November, Greek naval detachments had seized the islands of Imbros, Thasos, Agios Efstratios, Samothrace, Psara and Ikaria, and landings were undertaken on the larger islands of Lesbos and Chios only on 21 and 27 November, respectively. Substantial Ottoman garrisons were present on the latter two islands, and their resistance was fierce. They withdrew into the mountainous interior and were not subdued until 22 December 1912 and until 3 January 1913, respectively. Samos, officially an autonomous principality, was not attacked until 13 March 1913, out of a desire not to upset the Italians in the nearby Dodecanese. The clashes were short-lived, as the Ottoman forces withdrew to the Anatolian mainland, and the island was securely in Greek hands by 16 March.

At the same time, with the aid of numerous merchant ships converted to auxiliary cruisers, a loose naval blockade on the Ottoman coasts from the Dardanelles to Suez was instituted, which disrupted the Ottomans&#x27; flow of supplies (only the Black Sea routes to Romania remained open) and left some 250,000 Ottoman troops immobilized in Asia. Given the incomplete state of the Ottoman rail network, the Greek blockade meant that Ottomans&#x27; Asian reinforcements often had to march on foot in exhausting marches towards Constantinople before they could cross into Europe and affect the course of operations there. This contributed to the Balkan League&#x27;s early victories in the Balkans.
In the Ionian Sea, the Greek fleet operated without opposition, ferrying supplies for the army units on the Epirus front. Furthermore, the Greeks bombarded and then blockaded the port of Vlorë in Albania on 3 December and Durrës on 27 February. A naval blockade, extending from the pre-war Greek border to Vlorë, was also instituted on 3 December, isolating the newly established Provisional Government of Albania that was based there from any outside support.

====Confrontations off the Dardanelles====

The main Ottoman fleet remained inside the Dardanelles for the early part of the war, and the Greek destroyers continuously patrolled the straits&#x27; exit to report on a possible sortie. Kountouriotis suggested mining them, but that was not taken up out of fear of international opinion. On 7 December, the head of the Ottoman fleet, Tahir Bey, was replaced by Ramiz Naman Bey, the leader of the hawkish faction among the officer corps. A new strategy was agreed with the Ottomans to take advantage of any absence of &quot;Georgios Averof&quot; to attack the other Greek ships. The Ottoman staff formulated a plan to lure a number of the Greek destroyers on patrol into a trap. The first attempt, on 12 December, failed because of boiler trouble, but a second attempt, two days later, resulted in an indecisive engagement between the Greek destroyers and the cruiser &quot;Mecidiye&quot;.

The war&#x27;s first significant fleet action, the Battle of Elli, was fought two days later, on . The Ottoman fleet, with four battleships, nine destroyers and six torpedo boats, sailed to the entrance of the straits. The lighter Ottoman vessels remained behind, but the battleship squadron continued north, covered by forts at Kumkale, and engaged the Greek fleet coming from Imbros at 9:40. Leaving the older battleships to follow their original course, Kountouriotis led the &quot;Averof&quot; into independent action: using her superior speed, she cut across the Ottoman fleet&#x27;s bow. Under fire from two sides, the Ottomans were quickly forced to withdraw to the Dardanelles. The whole engagement lasted less than an hour in which the Ottomans suffered heavy damage to the &quot;Barbaros Hayreddin&quot; and 18 dead and 41 wounded (most during their disorderly retreat) and the Greeks had one dead and seven wounded.

In the aftermath of Elli, on 20 December, the energetic Lieutenant Commander Rauf Bey was placed in effective command of the Ottoman fleet. Two days later, he led his forces out in the hope of again trapping the patrolling Greek destroyers between two divisions of the Ottoman fleet, one heading for Imbros and the other waiting at the entrance of the straits. The plan failed as the Greek ships quickly broke contact. At the same time, the &quot;Mecidiye&quot; came under attack by the Greek submarine &quot;Delfin&quot;, which launched a torpedo against it but missed; it was the first such attack in history. The Ottoman army continued to press upon a reluctant Navy a plan for the reoccupation of Tenedos, which the Greek destroyers used as a base, by an amphibious operation scheduled for 4 January. That day, weather conditions were ideal, and the fleet was ready, but the &quot;Yenihan&quot; regiment earmarked for the operation failed to arrive on time. The naval staff still ordered the fleet to carry out a sortie, and an engagement developed with the Greek fleet without any significant results for either side. Though similar sorties followed on 10 and 11 January, the results of the &quot;cat and mouse&quot; operations were always the same: &quot;The Greek destroyers always managed to remain outside the Ottoman warships&#x27; range and each time the cruisers fired a few rounds before breaking off the chase.&quot;

In preparation for the next attempt to break the Greek blockade, the Ottoman Admiralty sought to create a diversion by sending the light cruiser &quot;Hamidiye&quot;, captained by Rauf Bey, to raid Greek merchant shipping in the Aegean. It was hoped that the &quot;Georgios Averof&quot;, the only substantial Greek unit fast enough to catch the &quot;Hamidiye&quot;, would be drawn into pursuit, weakening the remaining Greek fleet. In the event, &quot;Hamidiye&quot; slipped through the Greek patrols on the night of 14–15 January and bombarded the harbour of the Greek island of Syros, sinking the Greek auxiliary cruiser , which lay in anchor there (it was later raised and repaired). The &quot;Hamidiye&quot; then left the Aegean for the Eastern Mediterranean, making stops at Beirut and Port Said before it entered the Red Sea. Although it provided a significant morale boost for the Ottomans, the operation failed to achieve its primary objective since Kountouriotis refused to leave his post and pursue the &quot;Hamidiye&quot;.

Four days later, on , when the Ottoman fleet again sallied from the straits towards Lemnos, it was defeated for a second time in the Battle of Lemnos. This time, the Ottoman warships concentrated their fire on the &quot;Averof&quot;, which again made use of its superior speed and tried to &quot;cross the T&quot; of the Ottoman fleet. &quot;Barbaros Hayreddin&quot; was again heavily damaged, and the Ottoman fleet was forced to return to the shelter of the Dardanelles and their forts, with 41 killed and 101 wounded. It was the last attempt for the Ottoman navy to leave the Dardanelles, which left the Greeks dominant in the Aegean. On , a Greek Farman MF.7, piloted by Lieutenant Michael Moutousis and with Ensign Aristeidis Moraitinis as an observer, carried out aerial patrol of the Ottoman fleet in its anchorage at Nagara and launched four bombs on the anchored ships. Although it scored no hits, it is regarded as the first naval-air operation in military history.

General Ivanov, the commander of the Second Bulgarian Army, acknowledged the role of the Greek fleet in the overall Balkan League victory by stating that &quot;the activity of the entire Greek fleet and above all the &quot;Averof&quot; was the chief factor in the general success of the allies.&quot; The Ottomans were also aware of the impact of the Greek naval actions on the conflict; according to navy commander Hasan Sami Bey, without the Greek navy establishing control of the sea lanes, &quot;the allied land operations would have undoubtedly taken another course.&quot;

===Serbian and Montenegrin theatre===

The Serbian forces operated against the primary part of the Ottoman Western Army in Novi Pazar, Kosovo and northern and eastern Macedonia. Strategically, they were divided into four independent armies and groups operating against the Ottomans: the Javor brigade and the Ibar Army in Novi Pazar; the Third Army in Kosovo; the First Army in northern Macedonia; and the Second Army from Bulgaria in eastern Macedonia. The decisive battle was expected to be fought in north Macedonia, in the plains of Ovče Pole, where the Ottoman Vardar Army&#x27;s main forces were expected to concentrate.

The plan of the Serbian Supreme Command had three Serbian armies encircle and destroy the Vardar Army in that area, with the First Army advancing from the north (along the line of Vranje-Kumanovo-Ovče Pole), the Second Army from the east (along the line of Kriva Palanka-Kratovo-Ovče Pole) and the Third Army from the northwest (along the line of Priština-Skopje-Ovče Pole). The prime role was given to the First Army. The Second Army was expected to cut off the Vardar Army&#x27;s retreat and, if necessary, to attack its rear and right flank. The Third Army was to take Kosovo and, if necessary, to assist the First Army by attacking the Vardar Army&#x27;s left and rear. The Ibar Army and the Javor brigade had minor roles in the plan and were expected to secure the Sanjak of Novi Pazar and replace the Third Army in Kosovo after it had advanced south.

The Serbian army, under General (later Marshal) Putnik, achieved three decisive victories in Vardar Macedonia, the primary Serbian objective in the war, by effectively destroying the Ottoman forces in the region and conquering northern Macedonia. The Serbs also helped the Montenegrins take the Sandžak and sent two divisions to aid the Bulgarians at the siege of Edirne. The last battle for Macedonia was the Battle of Monastir, in which the remains of the Ottoman Vardar Army were forced to retreat to central Albania. After the battle, Serbian Prime Minister Pasic asked General Putnik to take part in the race for Thessaloniki. Putnik declined and turned his army to the west, towards Albania, since he saw that a war between Greece and Bulgaria over Thessaloniki could greatly help Serbia&#x27;s plans for Vardar Macedonia.

After pressure from the Great Powers, the Serbs started withdrawing from northern Albania and the Sandžak, yet left behind their heavy artillery park to help the Montenegrins in the continuing Siege of Shkodër. On 23 April 1913, Shkodër&#x27;s garrison was forced to surrender because of starvation.

==Atrocities and migrations==


Although it is known that both sides committed various war crimes during the war, what is known about the number of casualties is controversial. The insufficient number of impartial observers in the region throughout the war makes it difficult to conclude civilian casualties. It is estimated that in the years 1912–1914 c. 890,000 civilians of various nationalities crossed the borders of the Balkan countries, including also those of the Ottoman Empire. The intense influx of refugees from the region and the news of the massacres caused a deep shock in the Ottoman mainland. This further increased the hatred of minorities already present in Ottoman society. The situation became a factor that exacerbated the Ottoman genocides in World War I, which took place approximately two years after the end of the First Balkan War.

The heavy and rapid defeat of the Ottoman army prevented the safe evacuation of the Muslim civilians, making them a clear target for the Balkan League forces invading the region. As a result, it is estimated that, in total, up to 632,000-1.5 million Ottoman Muslims perished outside of Albania and c. 400,000–813,000 became refugees by the end of the Second Balkan War.

There were various instances where Albanian communities were targeted especially by Serbian and Montenegrin forces. According to contemporary accounts, c. 20,000–25,000 Albanians in the Kosovo Vilayet were killed in the first two to four months of the conflict. The number of Albanian deaths exceeded 120,000 by the end of the Second Balkan War. Hundreds of thousands of Albanians were deported throughout the Balkan Wars.

The Albanian declaration of independence led to further violence, as Albanian villagers created paramilitaries to fight against Ottoman forces. These paramilitaries were also responsible for destroying churches and targeting Greek-speaking Christian villages, killing women and children.

Successive Ottoman defeats already from 1911 and territorial losses resulted in the creation of strong nationalist tendencies in Turkish politics. In the spring of 1913, the Ottoman authorities began a systematic campaign of persecution of their Greek subjects in large numbers in towns and villages both in Eastern Thrace and Anatolia. This campaign of extermination by the Ottoman authorities included boycott, expulsions, forcible migrations, focusing on Greeks of the Aegean region and eastern Thrace, whose presence in these areas was deemed a threat to national security. From July 1913, as soon as Eastern Thrace returned to Ottoman control, pillaging and acts of intimidation and violence against the local Greek communities were perpetrated.

==Reasons for Ottoman defeat==
The principal reason for the Ottoman defeat in the autumn of 1912 was the decision on the part of the Ottoman government to respond to the demands from the Balkan League on 15 October 1912 by declaring war at a time when its mobilization, ordered on 1 October, was only partially complete. During the declaration of war, 580,000 Ottoman soldiers in the Balkans faced 912,000 soldiers of the Balkan League. The bad condition of the roads, together with the sparse railroad network, had led to the Ottoman mobilization being grossly behind schedule, and many of the commanders were new to their units, having been appointed only on 1 October 1912. Many Turkish divisions were still involved in a losing war with Italy far away in the Libyan provinces. The stress of fighting on multiple fronts took a massive toll on the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s finances, morale, casualties and supplies. The Turkish historian Handan Nezir Akmeşe wrote that the best response when they were faced with the Balkan League&#x27;s ultimatum on 15 October on the part of the Ottomans would have been to try to stall for time via diplomacy while they completed their mobilization, instead of declaring war immediately.

War Minister Nazım Pasha, Navy Minister Mahmud Muhtar Pasha and Austrian military attaché Josef Pomiankowski had presented overly-optimistic pictures of the Ottoman readiness for war to the Cabinet in October 1912 advising that the Ottoman forces should take the offensive at once at the outbreak of hostilities. By contrast, many senior army commanders advocated taking the defensive when the war began, arguing that the incomplete mobilization and serious logistic problems made taking the offensive impossible. Other reasons for the defeat were:
* Under the tyrannical and paranoid regime of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, the Ottoman army had been forbidden to engage in war games or maneuvers out of the fear that it might be the cover for a coup d&#x27;état. The four years since the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 had not been enough time for the army to learn how to conduct large-scale maneuvers. War games in 1909 and 1910 had shown that many Ottoman officers could not efficiently move large bodies of troops such as divisions and corps, a deficiency that General Baron Colmar von der Goltz stated after watching the 1909 war games would take at least five years of training to address.
*The Ottoman army was divided into two classes; &quot;Nizamiye&quot; troops (conscripted for five years) and &quot;Redif&quot; (reservists who served for seven years). Training of the &quot;Redif&quot; troops had been neglected for decades, and the 50,000 &quot;Redif&quot; troops in the Balkans in 1912 had received extremely rudimentary training at best. One German officer, Major Otto von Lossow, who served with the Ottomans, complained that some of the &quot;Redif&quot; troops did not know how to handle or fire a rifle.
* Support services in the Ottoman army, such as logistics and medical services, were poor. There was a massive shortage of doctors, no ambulances and few stretchers, and the few medical faculties were entirely inadequate for treating the large numbers of wounded. This resulted in most of them dying, which damaged morale. In particular, the badly-organized transport corps was so inefficient that it was unable to supply the troops in the field with food, which forced troops to resort to requisitioning food from local villages. Even so, Ottoman soldiers lived below the subsistence level with a daily diet of 90 g of cheese and 150 g of meat but had to march all day long, leaving much of the army sickly and exhausted. 
* The heavy rainfall in the fall of 1912 had turned the mud roads of the Balkans into quagmires, making it extremely difficult to supply the army in the field with ammunition, which led to constant shortages at the front.
* After the 1908 revolution, the Ottoman officer corps had become politicized, with many officers devoting themselves to politics at the expense of studying war. Furthermore, the politicization of the army had led it to be divided into factions, most notably between those who were members of the Committee of Union and Progress and its opponents. Additionally, the Ottoman officer corps had been divided between &quot;Alayli&quot; (&quot;ranker&quot;) officers who had been promoted up from NCOs and privates and the &quot;Mektepli&quot; (&quot;college-trained&quot;) officers who had graduated from the War College. After the 1909 counterrevolution attempt, many of the &quot;Alayli&quot; officers had been purged. The bulk of the army, peasant conscripts from Anatolia, were much more comfortable with the &quot;Alayli&quot; officers than with the &quot;Mektepli&quot; officers, who came from a different social milieu. Furthermore, the decision to conscript non-Muslims for the first time meant that &quot;jihad&quot;, the traditional motivating force for the Ottoman Army, was not used in 1912, something that the officers of the German military mission advising the Ottomans believed was bad for the Muslims&#x27; morale.

== Aftermath ==

The Treaty of London ended the First Balkan War on 30 May 1913. All Ottoman territory west of the Enez-Kıyıköy line was ceded to the Balkan League, according to the &quot;status quo&quot; at the time of the armistice. The treaty also declared Albania an independent state. Most of the territory designated to form the new Albanian state was occupied by Serbia and Greece, who only reluctantly withdrew their troops. Having unresolved disputes with Serbia over the division of northern Macedonia and with Greece over southern Macedonia, Bulgaria was prepared, if the need arose, to solve the problems by force, and began transferring its military from Eastern Thrace to the disputed regions. Unwilling to yield to any pressure, Greece and Serbia settled their mutual differences and signed a military alliance directed against Bulgaria on 1 May 1913, even before the Treaty of London had been concluded. This was soon followed by a treaty of &quot;mutual friendship and protection&quot; on 19 May / 1 June 1913. This set the stage for the Second Balkan War.

==Great Powers==

Although the Great Powers noticed the developments that led to the war, they had an official consensus over the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire, which led to a stern warning to the Balkan states. However, each Great Power took a different unofficial diplomatic approach since interests conflicted. Since the mixed unofficial signals cancelled any possible preventive effect of the mutual official warning, they failed to prevent or end the war:
* Russia was a prime mover in the establishment of the Balkan League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against its rival, Austria-Hungary. Russia was unaware of the Bulgarian plans for Thrace and Constantinople, territories for which it had long held ambitions.
*France, not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a position strongly against the war and firmly informed its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austria-Hungary if it resulted from actions of the Balkan League. France, however, failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the conflict.
*The British Empire, although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging the Greek entry into the League to counteract Russian influence. At the same time, it encouraged Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace since the British preferred Thrace to be Bulgarian to Russian, despite British assurances to Russia on its expansion there.
*Austria-Hungary, struggling for an exit from the Adriatic and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was opposed to any other nation expanding in the area. At the same time, Austria-Hungary had internal problems with the significant Slavic populations that campaigned against the German–Hungarian joint control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations towards Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the primary tool of Russian machinations, which were behind the agitation of the Slav subjects. However, Austria-Hungary failed to achieve a German backup for a strong reaction. Initially, German Emperor Wilhelm II told Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand that Germany was ready to support Austria-Hungary in all circumstances, even at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912, the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and notes about that passed to Austria-Hungary. Thus, no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania.
* The German Empire, already heavily involved in internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed the war. However, Germany&#x27;s effort to win Bulgaria for the Central Powers, since Germany saw the inevitability of Ottoman disintegration, made Germany toy with the idea of replacing the Ottomans in the Balkans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria with the borders of the Treaty of San Stefano. This was based on the German origin of the Bulgarian King Ferdinand and his anti-Russian sentiments. Finally, when tensions again grew hot in July 1914 between Serbia and Austria-Hungary, when the Black Hand, an organization backed by Serbia, assassinated Franz Ferdinand, no one had strong reservations about the possible conflict, and the First World War broke out.

<text>The Second Balkan War was a conflict that broke out when Bulgaria, dissatisfied with its share of the spoils of the First Balkan War, attacked its former allies, Serbia and Greece, on 16 (O.S.) / 29 (N.S.) June 1913. Serbian and Greek armies repulsed the Bulgarian offensive and counterattacked, entering Bulgaria. With Bulgaria also having previously engaged in territorial disputes with Romania and the bulk of Bulgarian forces engaged in the south, the prospect of an easy victory incited Romanian intervention against Bulgaria. The Ottoman Empire also took advantage of the situation to regain some lost territories from the previous war. When Romanian troops approached the capital Sofia, Bulgaria asked for an armistice, resulting in the Treaty of Bucharest, in which Bulgaria had to cede portions of its First Balkan War gains to Serbia, Greece and Romania. In the Treaty of Constantinople, it lost Adrianople to the Ottomans.

The political developments and military preparations for the Second Balkan War attracted an estimated 200 to 300 war correspondents from around the world.

==Background==

During the First Balkan War, which began in October 1912, the Balkan League (Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece) succeeded in driving out the Ottoman Empire from its European provinces (Albania, Macedonia, Sandžak and Thrace), leaving the Ottomans with only East Thrace. The Treaty of London, signed on 30 May 1913, which ended the war, acknowledged the Balkan states&#x27; gains west of the Enos–Midia line, drawn from Midia (Kıyıköy) on the Black Sea coast to Enos (Enez) on the Aegean Sea coast, on an &quot;uti possidetis&quot; basis, and created an independent Albania.

However, the relations between the victorious Balkan allies quickly soured over the division of the spoils, specifically in Macedonia. During the prewar negotiations that resulted in the Balkan League&#x27;s establishment, a secret agreement on 13 March 1912 was signed by Serbia and Bulgaria, which determined their future boundaries, effectively sharing northern Macedonia. In case of a postwar disagreement, the area to the north of the Kriva Palanka–Ohrid line (with both cities going to the Bulgarians) had been designated as a &quot;disputed zone&quot; under Russian arbitration, with the area to the south of this line assigned to Bulgaria. During the war, the Serbs succeeded in capturing an area far south of the agreed border, down to the Bitola–Gevgelija line (both in Serbian hands). At the same time, the Greeks advanced north, occupying Thessaloniki shortly before the Bulgarians arrived and establishing a common Greek border with Serbia.
When Bulgarian delegates in London bluntly warned the Serbs that they must not expect Bulgarian support on their Adriatic claims, the Serbs angrily replied that that was a blatant withdrawal from the prewar agreement of mutual understanding according to the Kriva Palanka-Adriatic line of expansion. The Bulgarians insisted that the Vardar Macedonian part of the agreement remained active, and the Serbs were still obliged to surrender the area as agreed. The Serbs responded by accusing the Bulgarians of maximalism, pointing out that if they lost both northern Albania and Vardar Macedonia, their participation in the common war would have been virtually for nothing.

When Bulgaria called upon Serbia to honour the prewar agreement over northern Macedonia, the Serbs, displeased at the Great Powers&#x27; requiring them to give up their gains in north Albania, adamantly refused to evacuate any more territory. The developments ended the Serbo-Bulgarian alliance and made a future war between the two countries inevitable. Soon, minor clashes broke out along the borders of the occupation zones with the Bulgarians against the Serbs and the Greeks. Responding to the perceived Bulgarian threat, Serbia started negotiations with Greece, which also had reasons to be concerned about Bulgarian intentions.

On 19 May/1 June 1913, two days after the signing of the Treaty of London and just 28 days before the Bulgarian attack, Greece and Serbia signed a secret defensive alliance, confirming the current demarcation line between the two occupation zones as their mutual border and concluding an alliance in case of an attack from Bulgaria or from Austria-Hungary. With this agreement, Serbia succeeded in making Greece a part of its dispute over northern Macedonia, since Greece had guaranteed Serbia&#x27;s current (and disputed) occupation zone in Macedonia. In an attempt to halt the Serbo-Greek rapprochement, Bulgarian Prime Minister Geshov signed a protocol with Greece on 21 May, agreeing on a permanent boundary between their respective forces, effectively accepting Greek control over southern Macedonia. However, his later dismissal ended the diplomatic targeting of Serbia.

Another point of friction arose: Bulgaria&#x27;s refusal to cede the fortress of Silistra to Romania. When Romania demanded its cession after the First Balkan War, Bulgaria&#x27;s foreign minister offered instead some minor border changes, which excluded Silistra, and assurances for the rights of the Kutzovlachs in Macedonia. Romania threatened to occupy Bulgarian territory by force, but a Russian proposal for arbitration prevented hostilities. In the resulting Protocol of St. Petersburg of 9 May 1913, Bulgaria agreed to give up Silistra. The resulting agreement was a compromise between the Romanian demands for the city, two triangles at the Bulgaria–Romania border and Balchik and the land between it and Romania and the Bulgarian refusal to accept any cession of its territory. However, the fact that Russia failed to protect the territorial integrity of Bulgaria made the Bulgarians uncertain of the reliability of the expected Russian arbitration of the dispute with Serbia. The Bulgarian behaviour also had a long-term impact on Russo-Bulgarian relations. The uncompromising Bulgarian position to review the prewar agreement with Serbia during a second Russian initiative for arbitration finally led Russia to cancel its alliance with Bulgaria. Both acts made conflict with Romania and Serbia inevitable.

==Preparation==
===Bulgarian war plans===

In 1912, Bulgaria&#x27;s national aspirations, as expressed by Tsar Ferdinand and the military leadership around him, exceeded the provisions of the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano, considered even then as maximalistic, since it included both Eastern and Western Thrace and all Macedonia with Thessaloniki, Edirne and Constantinople. Early evidence of the lack of realistic thinking in Bulgarian leadership was that although Russia had sent clear warnings expressed for the first time on 5 November 1912 (well before the First Battle of Çatalca) that if the Bulgarian army occupied Constantinople they would attack it, they continued their attempts to take the city.

Although the Bulgarian army succeeded in capturing Edirne, Tsar Ferdinand&#x27;s ambition in crowning himself Emperor in Constantinople also proved unrealistic when the Bulgarian army failed to capture the city in the First Battle of Çatalca. Even worse, the concentration on capturing Thrace and Constantinople ultimately caused the loss of most of Macedonia, including Thessaloniki, and that could not be accepted, leading the Bulgarian military leadership around Tsar Ferdinand to decide upon a war against its former allies. However, with the Ottomans unwilling to accept the loss of Thrace in the east, and an enraged Romania (in the north), the decision to open war against both Greece (to the south) and Serbia (to the west) was a rather adventurous one, since in May the Ottoman Empire had urgently requested a German mission to reorganize the Ottoman army. By mid-June, Bulgaria became aware of the agreement between Serbia and Greece in case of a Bulgarian attack. On 27 June, Montenegro announced that it would side with Serbia in the event of a Serbian-Bulgarian war. On 5 February, Romania settled her differences over Transylvania with Austria-Hungary, signing a military alliance, and on 28 June, officially warned Bulgaria that it would not remain neutral in a new Balkan war.
As skirmishing continued in Macedonia, mainly between Serbian and Bulgarian troops, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia tried to stop the upcoming conflict since Russia did not wish to lose either of its Slavic allies in the Balkans. On 8 June, he sent an identical personal message to the Kings of Bulgaria and Serbia, offering to act as arbitrator according to the provisions of the 1912 Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. Serbia was asking for a revision of the original treaty since it had already lost north Albania due to the Great Powers&#x27; decision to establish the state of Albania, which had been recognized as Serbian territory under the prewar Serbo-Bulgarian treaty, in exchange for Bulgarian expansion in northern Macedonia. The Bulgarian reply to the Russian invitation contained so many conditions that it amounted to an ultimatum, leading Russian diplomats to realize that the Bulgarians had already decided to go to war with Serbia. That caused Russia to cancel the arbitration initiative and angrily repudiate its 1902 treaty of alliance with Bulgaria. Bulgaria was shattering the Balkan League, Russia&#x27;s best defence against Austrian–Hungarian expansionism, a structure that had cost Russia much blood, money and diplomatic capital during the last 35 years. Russia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Sazonov&#x27;s exact words to Bulgaria&#x27;s new Prime Minister Stoyan Danev were &quot;Do not expect anything from us, and forget the existence of any of our agreements from 1902 until the present.&quot; Tsar Nicholas II of Russia was already angry with Bulgaria because the latter refused to honour its recently signed agreement with Romania over Silistra, which resulted from Russian arbitration. Then Serbia and Greece proposed that each of the three countries reduce its army by one-fourth as a first step to facilitate a peaceful solution, but Bulgaria rejected it.
Bulgaria was already on the track to war since a new cabinet had been formed in Bulgaria where the pacifist Geshov was replaced by the hardliner and head of a Russophile party, Danev, as premier. There is some evidence that to overcome Tsar Ferdinand&#x27;s reservations over a new war against Serbia and Greece, certain personalities in Sofia threatened to overthrow him. In any case, on 16 June, the Bulgarian high command, under the direct control of Tsar Ferdinand and without notifying the government, ordered Bulgarian troops to start a surprise attack simultaneously against both the Serbian and Greek positions without declaring war and to dismiss any orders contradicting the attack order. The next day the government pressured the General Staff to order the army to cease hostilities, which caused confusion and loss of initiative and failed to remedy the state of undeclared war. In response to the government pressure, Tsar Ferdinand dismissed General Savov and replaced him with General Dimitriev as commander-in-chief.
Bulgaria intended to defeat the Serbs and Greeks and to occupy areas as large as possible before the Great Powers interfered to end the hostilities. To provide the necessary superiority in arms, the entire Bulgarian army was committed to these operations. No provisions were made in case of an (officially declared) Romanian intervention or an Ottoman counterattack, strangely assuming that Russia would assure that no attack would come from those directions, even though on 9 June Russia had angrily repudiated its Bulgarian alliance and shifted its diplomacy towards Romania (Russia already had named Romania&#x27;s King Carol an honorary Russian field marshal, as a clear warning in changing its policy towards Sofia in December 1912). The plan was for a concentrated attack against the Serbian army across the Vardar plain to neutralize it and to capture northern Macedonia, together with a less concentrated one against the Greek military near Thessaloniki, which had approximately half the size of the Serbian army, to capture the city and south Macedonia. The Bulgarian high command was not sure whether their forces were enough to defeat the Greek army but believed them to be enough for defending the south front as a worst-case scenario until the arrival of reinforcements after defeating the Serbs to the north.

===Opposing forces===

According to the Military Law of 1903, the armed forces of Bulgaria were divided into two categories: the Active Army and the National Militia. The core of the Armed forces consisted of nine infantry and one cavalry division. The Bulgarian army had a unique organization among those of Europe since each infantry division had three brigades of two regiments, composed of four battalions of six heavy companies of 250 men each, plus an independent battalion, two large artillery regiments and one cavalry regiment, giving a total of 25 very heavy infantry battalions and 16 cavalry companies per division, which was more than the equivalent of two nine-battalion divisions, the standard divisional structure in most armies, as was also the case with the Greek and Serbian militaries in 1913. Consequently, although the Bulgarian army had 599,878 men mobilized at the beginning of the First Balkan War, there were only nine organizational divisions, giving a divisional strength closer to an Army Corps than to a Division. Tactical necessities during and after the First Balkan War modified this original structure: a new 10th division was formed using two brigades from the 1st and 6th divisions, and an additional three independent brigades were formed from recruits. Nevertheless, the heavy structure generally remained. By contrast, the Greek Army of Macedonia also had nine divisions, but the total number of men under arms was only 118,000. Another decisive factor affecting the real strength of the divisions between the opposing armies was the distribution of artillery. The nine-division-strong Greek Army had 176 guns, and the ten-division-strong Serbian army had 230. The Bulgarians had 1,116, a ratio of 6:1 against the Greeks and 5:1 against the Serbian army.

There is a dispute over the strength of the Bulgarian army during the Second Balkan War. At the outbreak of the First Balkan War, Bulgaria mobilized a total of 599,878 men (366,209 in the Active Army; 53,927 in the supplementing units; 53,983 in the National Militia; 94,526 from the 1912 and 1913 levies; 14,204 volunteers; 14,424 in the border guards). The non-recoverable casualties during the First Balkan War were 33,000 men (14,000 killed and 19,000 died of disease). To replace these casualties, Bulgaria conscripted 60,000 men between the two wars, mainly from the newly occupied areas, using 21,000 of them to form the Seres, Drama and Odrin (Edirne) independent brigades. It is known that there were no demobilized men. According to the Bulgarian command, the army had 7,693 officers and 492,528 soldiers in its ranks on 16 June (including the three brigades mentioned above). This gives a difference of 99,657 men in strength between the two wars. In comparison, subtracting the actual number of casualties, including wounded and adding the newly conscripted men produces no less than 576,878 men. The army was experiencing shortages of war materials and had only 378,998 rifles at its disposal.
The 1st and 3rd armies (under generals Vasil Kutinchev and Radko Dimitriev respectively) were deployed along the old Serbian-Bulgarian borders, with the 5th Army under general Stefan Toshev around Kyustendil, and the 4th Army under General Stiliyan Kovachev in the Kočani–Radoviš area. The 2nd Army under general Nikola Ivanov was detailed against the Greek army.

The army of the Kingdom of Serbia accounted for 348,000 men (out of which 252,000 were combatants) divided into three armies with ten divisions. Its main force was deployed on the Macedonian front along the Vardar River and near Skopje. Its nominal commander-in-chief was King Peter I, with Radomir Putnik as his chief of staff and effective field commander.

By early June, the army of the Kingdom of Greece had some 142,000 armed men with nine infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade. The bulk of the army with eight divisions and a cavalry brigade (117,861 men) was gathered in Macedonia, positioned in an arc covering Thessaloniki to the north and northeast of the city, while one division and independent units (24,416 men) were left in Epirus. With the eruption of hostilities, the 8th Infantry Division (stationed in Epirus) was transferred to the front, and with the arrival of recruits, the army&#x27;s strength in the Macedonian theatre increased eventually to some 145,000 men with 176 guns. King Constantine I assumed command of the Greek forces, with Lt. General Viktor Dousmanis as his chief of staff.

The Kingdom of Montenegro sent one division of 12,000 men under General Janko Vukotić to the Macedonian front.

The Kingdom of Romania had the largest army in the Balkans, although it had not seen action since the Romanian War of Independence against the Ottomans in 1878. Its peacetime strength was 6,149 officers and 94,170 men, and it was well equipped by Balkan standards, possessing 126 field batteries, fifteen howitzer and three mountain batteries made primarily by Krupp. Upon mobilizing, the Romanian army mustered 417,720 men allocated to five army corps. Some 80,000 were assembled to occupy the Southern Dobruja, while an army of 250,000 was assembled to carry the main offensive into Bulgaria.

==Start of the war==

The primary Bulgarian attack was planned against the Serbs with their 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th Armies, while the 2nd army was tasked with an attack toward Greek positions around Thessaloniki. However, in the crucial opening days of the war, only the 4th Army and 2nd Army were ordered to advance. This allowed the Serbs to concentrate their forces against the attacking Bulgarians and hold their advance. The Bulgarians were outnumbered on the Greek front, and the low-level fighting soon turned into a Greek attack all along the line on 19 June. The Bulgarian forces were forced to withdraw from their positions north of Thessaloniki (except the isolated battalion stationed in the city itself, which was quickly overrun) to defensive positions between Kilkis and Struma river. The plan to rapidly destroy the Serbian army in central Macedonia by concentrated attack turned out to be unrealistic, with the Bulgarian army starting to retreat even before Romanian intervention, and the Greek advance necessitated the disengagement of forces to defend Sofia.

==Bulgarian offensive against Greece==
The Bulgarian 2nd army in southern Macedonia, commanded by General Ivanov, held a line from Dojran Lake southeast to Kilkis, Lachanas, Serres and then across the Pangaion Hills to the Aegean Sea. The army had been in place since May and was considered a veteran force, having fought at the siege of Edirne in the First Balkan War. Though General Ivanov, possibly to avoid any responsibility for his crushing defeat, claimed after the war that his army consisted of only 36,000 men and that many of his units were weakened, a detailed analysis concerning his units contradicted him. Ivanov&#x27;s 2nd army consisted of the 3rd division minus one brigade with four regiments of four battalions (a total of 16 battalions plus the divisional artillery), the I/X brigade with the 16th and 25th regiments (total of eight battalions plus artillery), the Drama Brigade with the 69th, 75th and 7th regiments (total of 12 battalions), the Seres Brigade with 67th and 68th regiments (total of 8 battalions), the 11th division with the 55th, 56th and 57th regiments (total of 12 battalions plus the divisional artillery), the 5th Border Battalion, the 10th Independent Battalion and the 10th Cavalry Regiment of seven mounted and seven infantry companies. In total, Ivanov&#x27;s force comprised 232 companies in 58 infantry battalions, a cavalry regiment (14 companies) with 175 artillery guns, numbering between 80,000 (official Bulgarian source) and 108,000 (official Greek source according to the official Bulgarian history of the war before 1932). All modern historians agree that Ivanov underestimated the number of his soldiers, but the Greek army still had a numerical superiority. The Greek Headquarters also estimated the numbers of their opponents from 80,000 to 105,000 men. A large part of Ivanov&#x27;s forces, and especially the Drama Brigade and the Seres Brigade, were composed of completely untrained local recruits.
The Greek army, commanded by King Constantine I, had eight divisions and a cavalry brigade (117,861 men) with 176 artillery guns in a line extending from the Gulf of Orphanos to the Gevgelija area. Since the Greek headquarters did not know where the Bulgarian attack would occur, the Bulgarians would have temporary local superiority in the location chosen for the attack.

On 26 June, the Bulgarian army received orders to destroy the opposing Greek forces and to advance towards Thessaloniki. The Greeks stopped them, and by 29 June, an order for a general counterattack was issued. At Kilkis, the Bulgarians had constructed strong defences, including captured Ottoman guns which dominated the plain below. The Greek 4th, 2nd, and 5th divisions attacked across the plain in rushes supported by artillery. The Greek Army suffered heavy casualties but carried the trenches by the next day. On the Bulgarian left, the Greek 7th Division captured Serres and the 1st and 6th divisions captured Lachanas. The defeat of the 2nd army by the Greeks was the most serious military disaster suffered by the Bulgarians in the Second Balkan War. Bulgarian sources give 6,971 casualties, over 6,000 prisoners, and over 130 artillery pieces captured by the Greeks, who suffered 8,700 casualties. On 28 June, the retreating Bulgarian army and irregulars burned down the major city of Serres (a predominantly Greek town surrounded by both Bulgarianto the north and westand Greekto the east and southvillages), and the towns of Nigrita, Doxato and Demir Hisar, ostensibly as a retaliation for the burning of the Bulgarian town of Kilkis by the Greeks, which had taken place after the named battle, as well as the destruction of many Bulgarian villages in the region. On the Bulgarian right, Greek Evzones captured Gevgelija and the heights of Matsikovo. Consequentially, the Bulgarian line of retreat through Dojran was threatened, and Ivanov&#x27;s army began a desperate retreat, threatening at times to become a rout. Reinforcements from the 14th division came too late, joining the retreat towards Strumica and the Bulgarian border. The Greeks captured Dojran on 5 July but were unable to cut off the Bulgarian retreat through Struma Pass. On 11 July, the Greeks came in contact with the Serbs and then pushed up the Struma River. Meanwhile, the Greek forces, with the support of their navy, landed in Kavala and then penetrated inland to western Thrace. On 19 July, the Greeks captured Nevrokop, and on 25 July, in another amphibious operation, entered Dedeagac (today Alexandroupoli), thus cutting off the Bulgarians completely from the Aegean sea.

==Serbian front==

The 4th Bulgarian army held the most important position in the attempted conquest of Serbian Macedonia. The fighting began on 29–30 June 1913, between the 4th Bulgarian army and the 1st and 3rd Serbian armies, first along the Zletovska and then after a Bulgarian retreat, along the Bregalnica. Internal confusion led to heavy Bulgarian losses in 1–3 July. The Serbs captured the whole 7th Division of the 4th Bulgarian Army, without any fight. By 8 July, the Bulgarian army had been severely defeated.

On the north, the Bulgarians started to advance towards the Serbian border town of Pirot and forced Serbian Command to send reinforcements to the 2nd army defending Pirot and Niš. This enabled Bulgarians to stop the Serbian offensive in Macedonia at Kalimanci on 18 July.

On 13 July 1913, General Mihail Savov assumed control of the 4th and 5th Bulgarian armies. The Bulgarians dug into strong positions around the village of Kalimantsi, at the Bregalnica river in the northeastern Macedonia region. On 18 July, the Serbian 3rd army attacked, closing in on Bulgarian positions. The Bulgarians held firm, and the artillery successfully broke up the Serb attacks. If the Serbs had broken through the Bulgarian defences, they might have doomed the 2nd Bulgarian Army and driven the Bulgarians entirely out of Macedonia. The defensive victory, along with the successes to the north of the 1st and 3rd armies, protected western Bulgaria from a Serbian invasion. Although this boosted the Bulgarians, the situation was critical in the south, with the Greek Army.

==Greek offensive==

The Serbian front had become static. Seeing that the Bulgarian Army in front of him had already been defeated, King Constantine ordered the Greek Army to march further into Bulgarian territory and take the capital city of Sofia. Constantine wanted a decisive victory despite objections by his Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, who realized that the Serbs, having won their territorial objectives, now adopted a passive stance and shifted the weight of carrying the rest of the war to the Greeks. In the pass of Kresna (Battle of Kresna Gorge), the Greeks were ambushed by the Bulgarian 2nd and 4th armies, which had newly arrived from the Serbian front and had taken defensive positions there. By 21 July, the Greek army was outnumbered by the now counterattacking Bulgarians, and the Bulgarian General Staff, attempting to encircle the Greeks in a Cannae-type battle, was applying pressure on their flanks. However, after bitter fighting, the Greek side managed to break through the Kresna pass and captured Simitli on 26 July, while at the night of 27–28 July, the Bulgarian forces were pushed north to Gorna Dzhumaya (Blagoevgrad), south of Sofia. Meanwhile, the Greek forces continued their march inland into western Thrace, on 26 July, they entered Xanthi and the next day Komotini. On 28 July, the Bulgarian army, under heavy pressure, was forced to abandon Gorna Dzhumaya.

The Greek army was exhausted and faced logistical difficulties, but resisted strenuously and launched local counterattacks. By 30 July, the Bulgarian army downscaled its attacks, having to repulse Greek counterattacks on both sides. On the eastern flank, the Greek army launched a counterattack towards Mehomia through the Predela pass. The offensive was stopped by the Bulgarians on the eastern side of the pass and fighting ground to a stalemate. On the western flank, an offensive was launched against Tsarevo Selo to reach the Serbian lines. This failed, and the Bulgarian army continued advancing, especially in the south. However, after three days of fighting at the sectors of Pehchevo and Mahomia, the Greek forces retained their positions.

==Romanian intervention==

Romania mobilized its army on 5 July 1913, intending to seize Southern Dobruja, and declared war on Bulgaria on 10 July. In a diplomatic circular that said, &quot;Romania does not intend either to subjugate the polity nor defeat the army of Bulgaria,&quot; the Romanian government endeavoured to allay international concerns about its motives and about increased bloodshed. According to Richard Hall, &quot;[t]he entrance of Romania into the conflict made the Bulgarian situation untenable [and t]he Romanian thrust across the Danube was the decisive military act of the Second Balkan War.&quot;

On the day of Romania&#x27;s declaration, 80,000 men of the 5th Corps under General Ioan Culcer invaded Dobruja, occupying a front from Tutrakan to Balchik. The corps cavalry occupied the port city of Varna until it was clear that there would be no Bulgarian resistance. On the night of 14–15 July, the Danube Army under Prince Ferdinand crossed into Bulgaria at Oryahovo, Gigen and Nikopol. The initial occupation completed, Romanian forces were divided into two groups: one advanced westward, towards Ferdinand (now Montana), and the other advanced southwestward, towards Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, everywhere preceded by a wide fan of cavalry troops in reconnaissance.

On 18 July, Romania took Ferdinand, and on 20 July, they occupied Vratsa, north of Sofia. On 23 July, advanced cavalry forces had entered Vrazhdebna, a suburb only from Sofia. The Romanians and Serbs linked up at Belogradchik on 25 July, isolating the important city of Vidin. The Bulgarian rear was entirely exposed, no resistance had been offered, the capital was open to the invader, and the country&#x27;s northwestern corner was cut off and surrounded. During the invasion, the fledgling Romanian Air Corps performed photoreconnaissance and propaganda leaflet drops. Sofia became the first capital city in the world to be overflown by enemy aircraft.

Romania did not count any combat casualties during its brief war. Its forces were struck by an outbreak of cholera, which cut down 1,600 men.

==Ottoman intervention==

The lack of resistance to the Romanian invasion convinced the Ottomans to invade the territories just ceded to Bulgaria. The main object of the invasion was the recovery of Edirne (Adrianople), which was held by Major General Vulko Velchev with a mere 4,000 troops. Most Bulgarian forces occupying East Thrace had been withdrawn to face the Serbo-Greek attack earlier in the year. On 12 July, Ottoman troops garrisoning Çatalca and Gelibolu reached the Enos–Midia line and on 20 July 1913 crossed the line and invaded Bulgaria. The entire Ottoman invasion force contained between 200,000 and 250,000 men under the command of Ahmed Izzet Pasha. The 1st Army was stationed at the eastern (Midia) end of the line. From east to west it was followed by the 2nd Army, 3rd Army and 4th Army, which was stationed at Gelibolu.

In the face of the advancing Ottomans, the outnumbered Bulgarian forces retreated to the prewar border. Edirne was abandoned on 19 July, but, since the Ottomans did not occupy it immediately, the Bulgarians re-occupied it the next day (20 July). Since it was apparent that the Ottomans were not stopping, it was abandoned a second time on 21 July and occupied by the Ottomans on 23 July. Edirne had been conquered by Sultan Murad I in the 1360s and had served as the first European capital of the Empire before the capture of Constantinople in 1453. Minister of War Enver Pasha called himself the &quot;Second Conqueror of Edirne,&quot; although the conquering forces had met no resistance on the way to Edirne.

The Ottoman armies did not stop at the old border but crossed into Bulgarian territory. A cavalry unit advanced on Yambol and captured it on 25 July. The Ottoman invasion, more than the Romanian, incited panic among the peasantry, many of whom fled to the mountains. Among the leadership, it was recognized as a complete reversal of fortune. In the words of historian Richard Hall, &quot;[t]he battlefields of eastern Thrace, where so many Bulgarian soldiers had died to win the First Balkan War, were again under Ottoman control.&quot; Like the Romanians, the Ottomans suffered no combat casualties but lost 4,000 soldiers to cholera. Some 8000 Armenians fighting for the Ottomans were wounded. The sacrifice of these Armenians was praised greatly in Turkish papers.

To help Bulgaria repulse the rapid Ottoman advance in Thrace, Russia threatened to attack the Ottoman Empire through the Caucasus and send its Black Sea Fleet to Constantinople; this caused Britain to intervene.

The Bulgarian command began to transfer troops to Thrace and on 20 July, with increasing resistance, the Turkish advance was halted.

According to the 1918 book &quot;Destruction of the Thracian Bulgarians in 1913&quot;, Ottoman forces perpetrated atrocities against the Bulgarians in Eastern Thrace during the invasion and aftermath.

==Negotiating a way out==
===Armistice===
As the Romanian army closed in on Sofia, Bulgaria asked Russia to mediate. On 13 July, Prime Minister Stoyan Danev resigned in the face of Russian inactivity. On 17 July, the tsar appointed Vasil Radoslavov to head a pro-German and Russophobic government. On 20 July, via Saint Petersburg, the Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić invited a Bulgarian delegation to treat with the allies directly at Niš in Serbia. The Serbs and Greeks, both now on the offensive, were in no rush to conclude a peace. On 22 July, Tsar Ferdinand sent a message to King Carol via the Italian ambassador in Bucharest. The Romanian armies halted before Sofia. Romania proposed that talks be moved to Bucharest, and the delegations took a train from Niš to Bucharest on 24 July.

When the delegations met in Bucharest on 30 July, the Serbs were led by Pašić, the Montenegrins by Vukotić, the Greeks by Venizelos, the Romanians by Titu Maiorescu and the Bulgarians by Finance Minister Dimitur Tonchev. They agreed to a five-day armistice to come into effect on 31 July. Romania refused to allow the Ottomans to participate, forcing Bulgaria to negotiate with them separately.

===Treaty of Bucharest===
Bulgaria had agreed to cede Southern Dobruja to Romania as early as 19 July. At the peace talks in Bucharest, the Romanians, having obtained their primary objective, were a voice for moderation. The Bulgarians hoped to keep the 
Vardar River as the boundary between their share of Macedonia and Serbia&#x27;s. The latter preferred to retain all of Macedonia as far as the Struma. Austro-Hungarian and Russian pressure forced Serbia to be satisfied with most of northern Macedonia, conceding only the town of Štip to the Bulgarians, in Pašić&#x27;s words, &quot;in honour of General Fichev,&quot; who had brought Bulgarian arms to the door of Constantinople in the first war. Ivan Fichev was chief of the Bulgarian general staff and a member of the delegation in Bucharest at the time. When Fichev explained why Bulgaria deserved Kavala, a port on the Aegean occupied by the Greeks, Venizelos is said to have responded, &quot;General, we are not responsible. Before [29] June, we were afraid of you and offered you Serres and Drama and Kavala, but now when we see you, we assume the role of victors and will take care of our interests only.&quot; Although Austria-Hungary and Russia supported Bulgaria, the influential alliance of Germany—whose Kaiser Wilhelm II was brother-in-law to the Greek king—and France secured Kavala for Greece. Bulgaria retained the underdeveloped port of Dedeagac (Alexandroupoli).

The last day of negotiations was 8 August. On 10 August, Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro, Romania, and Serbia signed the Treaty of Bucharest and divided Macedonia in three: Vardar Macedonia went to Serbia; the smallest part, Pirin Macedonia, to Bulgaria; and the coastal and largest part, Aegean Macedonia, to Greece. Bulgaria thus enlarged its territory by 16 percent compared to what it was before the First Balkan War, increasing its population from 4.3 to 4.7 million people. Romania enlarged its territory by 5 percent and Montenegro by 62 percent. Greece increased her population from 2.7 to 4.4 million and her territory by 68 percent. Serbia almost doubled her territory, enlarging her population from 2.9 to 4.5 million.

The Montenegrins at Bucharest were primarily interested in obtaining a favourable concession from Serbia in the former Sanjak of Novi Pazar. They did it, later confirming it in a treaty signed at Belgrade on 7 November.

===Ottoman treaties===

In August, Ottoman forces established a provisional government of Western Thrace at Komotini to pressure Bulgaria to make peace. Bulgaria sent a three-member delegation—General Mihail Savov and the diplomats Andrei Toshev and Grigor Nachovich—to Constantinople to negotiate peace on 6 September. The Ottoman delegation was led by Foreign Minister Mehmed Talat Bey, assisted by future Naval Minister Çürüksulu Mahmud Pasha and Halil Bey. Although Russia tried to intervene throughout August to prevent Edirne from becoming Turkish again, Toshev told the Ottomans at Constantinople that &quot;[t]he Russians consider Constantinople their natural inheritance. Their main concern is that when Constantinople falls into their hands it shall have the largest possible hinterland. If Adrianople is in the possession of the Turks, they shall get it too.&quot;

Resigned to losing Edirne, the Bulgarians played for Kırk Kilise (Lozengrad in Bulgarian). Both sides made competing declarations: Savov that &quot;Bulgaria, who defeated the Turks on all fronts, cannot end this glorious campaign with the signing of an agreement which retains none of the battlefields on which so much Bulgarian blood has been shed,&quot; and Mahmud Pasha that &quot;[w]hat we have taken is ours.&quot; In the end, none of the battlefields were retained in the Treaty of Constantinople of 30 September. In October, Bulgarian forces finally returned south of the Rhodopes. The Radoslavov government continued negotiating with the Ottomans in the hopes of forming an alliance. These talks finally bore fruit in the Secret Bulgarian–Ottoman Treaty of August 1914.

As part of the Treaty of Constantinople, 46,764 Orthodox Bulgarians from Ottoman Thrace were exchanged for 48,570 Muslims (Turks, Pomaks, and Roma) from Bulgarian Thrace. After the exchange, according to the 1914 Ottoman census, there remained 14,908 Bulgarians belonging to the Bulgarian Exarchate in Ottoman Empire.

On 14 November 1913, Greece and the Ottomans signed a treaty in Athens, formally ending their hostilities. On 14 March 1914, Serbia signed a treaty in Constantinople, restoring relations with the Ottoman Empire and reaffirming the 1913 Treaty of London. No treaty between Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire was ever signed.

==Aftermath==
The Second Balkan War made Serbia the most militarily powerful state south of the Danube. Years of military investment financed by French loans borne fruit. Central Vardar and the eastern half of the Sanjak of Novi Pazar were acquired. Its territory grew in extent from 18,650 to 33,891 square miles, and its population grew by more than one and a half million. The aftermath brought harassment and oppression for many in the newly conquered lands. The freedom of association, assembly and the press guaranteed under the Serbian constitution of 1903 was not introduced into the new territories. The inhabitants were denied voting rights, ostensibly because the cultural level was considered too low, in reality, to keep the non-Serbs, who made up the majority in many areas, out of national politics. Opposition newspapers like &quot;Radicke Novine&quot; remarked that the &#x27;new Serbs&#x27; had better political rights under the Turks. There was a destruction of Turkish buildings, schools, baths, mosques. In October and November 1913, British vice-consuls reported systematic intimidation, arbitrary detentions, beatings, rapes, village burnings and massacres by Serbs in the annexed areas. The Serbian government showed no interest in preventing further outrages or investigating those that had happened. When the Carnegie Commission, composed of an international team of experts selected for their impartiality, arrived in the Balkans, they received virtually no assistance from Belgrade.

The treaties forced the Greek Army to evacuate Western Thrace and Pirin Macedonia, which it had occupied during operations. The retreat from the areas that had to be ceded to Bulgaria, together with the loss of Northern Epirus to Albania, was not well received in Greece; from the areas occupied during the war, Greece succeeded in gaining only the territories of Serres and Kavala after diplomatic support from Germany. Serbia made additional gains in northern Macedonia and, having fulfilled its aspirations to the south, turned its attention to the north where its rivalry with Austro-Hungary over Bosnia-Herzegovina led the two countries to war a year later igniting the First World War. Italy used the excuse of the Balkan wars to keep the Dodecanese islands in the Aegean, which it had occupied during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911 over Libya, despite the agreement that ended that war in 1912.

At the strong insistence of Austria-Hungary and Italy, both hoping to control for themselves the state and thus the Otranto Straits in Adriatic, Albania acquired officially its independence according to the terms of the Treaty of London. With the delineation of the exact boundaries of the new state under the Protocol of Florence (17 December 1913), the Serbs lost their outlet to the Adriatic and the Greeks in the region of Northern Epirus (Southern Albania). This was highly unpopular with the local Greek population, who, after a revolt, managed to acquire local autonomy under the terms of the Protocol of Corfu.

After its defeat, Bulgaria became a revanchist local power looking for a second opportunity to fulfill its national aspirations. After Bucharest, the head of the Bulgarian delegation, Tonchev, remarked that &quot;[e]ither the Powers will change [the territorial settlement], or we will destroy it.&quot;

The political upheavals and territorial shifts resulting from the Second Balkan War also resonated beyond Europe. The Indian Muslim community, with its strong pan-Islamic sentiment towards the Ottoman Empire, was significantly impacted. The Indian Red Crescent Mission&#x27;s involvement with the Ottoman lands during the Balkan Wars fostered a deeper connection between Indian Muslims and the Ottoman cause, influencing political movements in India, including the Khilafat Movement and the eventual founding of the Muslim League.

To this end, it participated in the First World War on the side of the Central Powers since its Balkan enemies (Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Romania) were pro-Entente (see articles on the Serbian Campaign and the Macedonian front of World War I). The resulting enormous sacrifices during World War I and renewed defeat caused Bulgaria a national trauma and new territorial losses.

<text>In differential geometry, the Lie derivative ( ), named after Sophus Lie by Władysław Ślebodziński, evaluates the change of a tensor field (including scalar functions, vector fields and one-forms), along the flow defined by another vector field. This change is coordinate invariant and therefore the Lie derivative is defined on any differentiable manifold.

Functions, tensor fields and forms can be differentiated with respect to a vector field. If &quot;T&quot; is a tensor field and &quot;X&quot; is a vector field, then the Lie derivative of &quot;T&quot; with respect to &quot;X&quot; is denoted formula_1. The differential operator formula_2 is a derivation of the algebra of tensor fields of the underlying manifold.

The Lie derivative commutes with contraction and the exterior derivative on differential forms.

Although there are many concepts of taking a derivative in differential geometry, they all agree when the expression being differentiated is a function or scalar field. Thus in this case the word &quot;Lie&quot; is dropped, and one simply speaks of the derivative of a function.

The Lie derivative of a vector field &quot;Y&quot; with respect to another vector field &quot;X&quot; is known as the &quot;Lie bracket&quot; of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, and is often denoted [&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;] instead of formula_3. The space of vector fields forms a Lie algebra with respect to this Lie bracket. The Lie derivative constitutes an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra representation of this Lie algebra, due to the identity

:formula_4

valid for any vector fields &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; and any tensor field &quot;T&quot;.

Considering vector fields as infinitesimal generators of flows (i.e. one-dimensional groups of diffeomorphisms) on &quot;M&quot;, the Lie derivative is the differential of the representation of the diffeomorphism group on tensor fields, analogous to Lie algebra representations as infinitesimal representations associated to group representation in Lie group theory.

Generalisations exist for spinor fields, fibre bundles with a connection and vector-valued differential forms.

==Motivation==
A &#x27;naïve&#x27; attempt to define the derivative of a tensor field with respect to a vector field would be to take the components of the tensor field and take the directional derivative of each component with respect to the vector field. However, this definition is undesirable because it is not invariant under changes of coordinate system, e.g. the naive derivative expressed in polar or spherical coordinates differs from the naive derivative of the components in Cartesian coordinates. On an abstract manifold such a definition is meaningless and ill defined.

In differential geometry, there are three main coordinate independent notions of differentiation of tensor fields:

# Lie derivatives,
# derivatives with respect to connections,
# the exterior derivative of totally antisymmetric covariant tensors, i.e. differential forms.

The main difference between the Lie derivative and a derivative with respect to a connection is that the latter derivative of a tensor field with respect to a tangent vector is well-defined even if it is not specified how to extend that tangent vector to a vector field. However, a connection requires the choice of an additional geometric structure (e.g. a Riemannian metric in the case of Levi-Civita connection, or just an abstract connection) on the manifold. In contrast, when taking a Lie derivative, no additional structure on the manifold is needed, but it is impossible to talk about the Lie derivative of a tensor field with respect to a single tangent vector, since the value of the Lie derivative of a tensor field with respect to a vector field &quot;X&quot; at a point &quot;p&quot; depends on the value of &quot;X&quot; in a neighborhood of &quot;p&quot;, not just at &quot;p&quot; itself. Finally, the exterior derivative of differential forms does not require any additional choices, but is only a well defined derivative of differential forms (including functions), thus excluding vectors and other tensors that are not purely differential forms.

The idea of Lie derivatives is to use a vector field to define a notion of transport (Lie transport). A smooth vector field defines a smooth flow on the manifold, which allows vectors to be transported between two points on the same line of flow (This contrasts with connections, which allows transport between arbitrary points). Intuitively, a vector formula_5 based at point formula_6 is transported by flowing its base point to formula_7, while flowing its tip point formula_8 to formula_9.

==Definition==
The Lie derivative may be defined in several equivalent ways. To keep things simple, we begin by defining the Lie derivative acting on scalar functions and vector fields, before moving on to the definition for general tensors.

===The (Lie) derivative of a function===
Defining the derivative of a function formula_10 on a manifold is problematic because the difference quotient formula_11 cannot be determined while the displacement formula_12 is undefined.

The Lie derivative of a function formula_13 with respect to a vector field formula_14 at a point formula_15 is the function
:formula_16
where formula_17 is the point to which the flow defined by the vector field formula_14 maps the point formula_6 at time instant formula_20 In the vicinity of formula_21 formula_17 is the unique solution of the system
:formula_23
of first-order autonomous (i.e. time-independent) differential equations, with formula_24

Setting formula_25 identifies the Lie derivative of a function with the directional derivative, which is also denoted by formula_26. 

===The Lie derivative of a vector field===
If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are both vector fields, then the Lie derivative of &quot;Y&quot; with respect to &quot;X&quot; is also known as the Lie bracket of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, and is sometimes denoted formula_27. There are several approaches to defining the Lie bracket, all of which are equivalent. We list two definitions here, corresponding to the two definitions of a vector field given above:

===The Lie derivative of a tensor field===
====Definition in terms of flows====
The Lie derivative is the speed with which the tensor field changes under the space deformation caused by the flow.

Formally, given a differentiable (time-independent) vector field formula_14 on a smooth manifold formula_29 let formula_30 be the corresponding local flow. Since formula_31 is a local diffeomorphism for each formula_32, it gives rise to a pullback of tensor fields. For covariant tensors, this is just the multi-linear extension of the pullback map

formula_33
For contravariant tensors, one extends the inverse
:formula_34

of the differential formula_35. For every formula_36 there is, consequently, a tensor field formula_37 of the same type as formula_38&#x27;s.

If formula_38 is an formula_40- or formula_41-type tensor field, then the Lie derivative formula_42 of formula_38 along a vector field formula_14 is defined at point formula_15 to be

:formula_46

The resulting tensor field formula_47 is of the same type as formula_38&#x27;s.

More generally, for every smooth 1-parameter family formula_49 of diffeomorphisms that integrate a vector field formula_50 in the sense that formula_51, one hasformula_52

====Algebraic definition====
We now give an algebraic definition. The algebraic definition for the Lie derivative of a tensor field follows from the following four axioms:

:Axiom 1. The Lie derivative of a function is equal to the directional derivative of the function. This fact is often expressed by the formula
::formula_53

:Axiom 2. The Lie derivative obeys the following version of Leibniz&#x27;s rule: For any tensor fields &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, we have
::formula_54

:Axiom 3. The Lie derivative obeys the Leibniz rule with respect to contraction:
::formula_55

:Axiom 4. The Lie derivative commutes with exterior derivative on functions:
::formula_56

If these axioms hold, then applying the Lie derivative formula_57 to the relation formula_58 shows that
::formula_59
which is one of the standard definitions for the Lie bracket.

The Lie derivative acting on a differential form is the anticommutator of the interior product with the exterior derivative. So if α is a differential form,
::formula_60
This follows easily by checking that the expression commutes with exterior derivative, is a derivation (being an anticommutator of graded derivations) and does the right thing on functions. This is Cartan&#x27;s magic formula. See interior product for details.

Explicitly, let &quot;T&quot; be a tensor field of type . Consider &quot;T&quot; to be a differentiable multilinear map of smooth sections &quot;α&quot;1, &quot;α&quot;2, ..., &quot;α&quot;&quot;p&quot; of the cotangent bundle &quot;T&quot;∗&quot;M&quot; and of sections &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., &quot;X&quot;q of the tangent bundle &quot;TM&quot;, written &quot;T&quot;(&quot;α&quot;1, &quot;α&quot;2, ..., &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ...) into R. Define the Lie derivative of &quot;T&quot; along &quot;Y&quot; by the formula

:formula_61
::formula_62
::formula_63

The analytic and algebraic definitions can be proven to be equivalent using the properties of the pushforward and the Leibniz rule for differentiation. The Lie derivative commutes with the contraction.

===The Lie derivative of a differential form===

A particularly important class of tensor fields is the class of differential forms. The restriction of the Lie derivative to the space of differential forms is closely related to the exterior derivative. Both the Lie derivative and the exterior derivative attempt to capture the idea of a derivative in different ways. These differences can be bridged by introducing the idea of an interior product, after which the relationships falls out as an identity known as Cartan&#x27;s formula. Cartan&#x27;s formula can also be used as a definition of the Lie derivative on the space of differential forms.

Let &quot;M&quot; be a manifold and &quot;X&quot; a vector field on &quot;M&quot;. Let formula_64 be a &quot;k&quot;-form, i.e., for each formula_15, formula_66 is an alternating multilinear map from formula_67 to the real numbers. The interior product of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;ω&quot; is the -form formula_68 defined as

:formula_69

The differential form formula_68 is also called the contraction of &quot;ω&quot; with &quot;X&quot;, and
:formula_71

is a formula_72-antiderivation where formula_72 is the wedge product on differential forms. That is, formula_74 is R-linear, and

:formula_75

for formula_64 and η another differential form. Also, for a function formula_77, that is, a real- or complex-valued function on &quot;M&quot;, one has

:formula_78

where formula_79 denotes the product of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;X&quot;.
The relationship between exterior derivatives and Lie derivatives can then be summarized as follows. First, since the Lie derivative of a function &quot;f&quot; with respect to a vector field &quot;X&quot; is the same as the directional derivative &quot;X&quot;(&quot;f&quot;), it is also the same as the contraction of the exterior derivative of &quot;f&quot; with &quot;X&quot;:

:formula_80

For a general differential form, the Lie derivative is likewise a contraction, taking into account the variation in &quot;X&quot;:

:formula_81

This identity is known variously as Cartan formula, Cartan homotopy formula or Cartan&#x27;s magic formula. See interior product for details. The Cartan formula can be used as a definition of the Lie derivative of a differential form. Cartan&#x27;s formula shows in particular that

:formula_82

The Lie derivative also satisfies the relation

:formula_83

==Coordinate expressions==
In local coordinate notation, for a type tensor field formula_38, the Lie derivative along formula_14 is
:formula_86

here, the notation formula_87 means taking the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate formula_88. Alternatively, if we are using a torsion-free connection (e.g., the Levi Civita connection), then the partial derivative formula_89 can be replaced with the covariant derivative which means replacing formula_90 with (by abuse of notation) formula_91 where the formula_92 are the Christoffel coefficients.

The Lie derivative of a tensor is another tensor of the same type, i.e., even though the individual terms in the expression depend on the choice of coordinate system, the expression as a whole results in a tensor
:formula_93
which is independent of any coordinate system and of the same type as formula_38.

The definition can be extended further to tensor densities. If &quot;T&quot; is a tensor density of some real number valued weight &quot;w&quot; (e.g. the volume density of weight 1), then its Lie derivative is a tensor density of the same type and weight.
:formula_95

Notice the new term at the end of the expression.

For a linear connection formula_96, the Lie derivative along formula_14 is
:formula_98

===Examples===
For clarity we now show the following examples in local coordinate notation.

For a scalar field formula_99 we have:
:formula_100.

Hence for the scalar field formula_101 and the vector field formula_102 the corresponding Lie derivative becomes 
formula_103

For an example of higher rank differential form, consider the 2-form formula_104 and the vector field formula_14 from the previous example. Then,
formula_106

Some more abstract examples.
:formula_107.

Hence for a covector field, i.e., a differential form, formula_108 we have:
:formula_109

The coefficient of the last expression is the local coordinate expression of the Lie derivative. 

For a covariant rank 2 tensor field formula_110 we have:
formula_111

If formula_112 is the symmetric metric tensor, it is parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection (aka covariant derivative), and it becomes fruitful to use the connection. This has the effect of replacing all derivatives with covariant derivatives, giving
:formula_113

==Properties==
The Lie derivative has a number of properties. Let formula_114 be the algebra of functions defined on the manifold &quot;M&quot;. Then

:formula_115

is a derivation on the algebra formula_114. That is,
formula_57 is R-linear and

:formula_118

Similarly, it is a derivation on formula_119 where formula_120 is the set of vector fields on &quot;M&quot;:

:formula_121

which may also be written in the equivalent notation

:formula_122

where the tensor product symbol formula_123 is used to emphasize the fact that the product of a function times a vector field is being taken over the entire manifold.

Additional properties are consistent with that of the Lie bracket. Thus, for example, considered as a derivation on a vector field,

:formula_124

one finds the above to be just the Jacobi identity. Thus, one has the important result that the space of vector fields over &quot;M&quot;, equipped with the Lie bracket, forms a Lie algebra.

The Lie derivative also has important properties when acting on differential forms. Let &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; be two differential forms on &quot;M&quot;, and let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be two vector fields. Then
* formula_125
* formula_126
* formula_127 where &quot;i&quot; denotes interior product defined above and it is clear whether [·,·] denotes the commutator or the Lie bracket of vector fields.

==Generalizations==
Various generalizations of the Lie derivative play an important role in differential geometry.

===The Lie derivative of a spinor field===
A definition for Lie derivatives of spinors along generic spacetime vector fields, not necessarily Killing ones, on a general (pseudo) Riemannian manifold was already proposed in 1971 by Yvette Kosmann. Later, it was provided a geometric framework which justifies her &quot;ad hoc&quot; prescription within the general framework of Lie derivatives on fiber bundles in the explicit context of gauge natural bundles which turn out to be the most appropriate arena for (gauge-covariant) field theories.

In a given spin manifold, that is in a Riemannian manifold formula_128 admitting a spin structure, the Lie derivative of a spinor field formula_129 can be defined by first defining it with respect to infinitesimal isometries (Killing vector fields) via the André Lichnerowicz&#x27;s local expression given in 1963:

:formula_130

where formula_131, as formula_132 is assumed to be a Killing vector field, and formula_133 are Dirac matrices.

It is then possible to extend Lichnerowicz&#x27;s definition to all vector fields (generic infinitesimal transformations) by retaining Lichnerowicz&#x27;s local expression for a &quot;generic&quot; vector field formula_14, but explicitly taking the antisymmetric part of formula_135 only. More explicitly, Kosmann&#x27;s local expression given in 1972 is:

:formula_136

where formula_137 is the commutator, formula_138 is exterior derivative, formula_139 is the dual 1 form corresponding to formula_14 under the metric (i.e. with lowered indices) and formula_141 is Clifford multiplication.

It is worth noting that the spinor Lie derivative is independent of the metric, and hence also of the connection. This is not obvious from the right-hand side of Kosmann&#x27;s local expression, as the right-hand side seems to depend on the metric through the spin connection (covariant derivative), the dualisation of vector fields (lowering of the indices) and the Clifford multiplication on the spinor bundle. Such is not the case: the quantities on the right-hand side of Kosmann&#x27;s local expression combine so as to make all metric and connection dependent terms cancel.

To gain a better understanding of the long-debated concept of Lie derivative of spinor fields one may refer to the original article, where the definition of a Lie derivative of spinor fields is placed in the more general framework of the theory of Lie derivatives of sections of fiber bundles and the direct approach by Y. Kosmann to the spinor case is generalized to gauge natural bundles in the form of a new geometric concept called the Kosmann lift.

===Covariant Lie derivative===
If we have a principal bundle over the manifold M with G as the structure group, and we pick X to be a covariant vector field as section of the tangent space of the principal bundle (i.e. it has horizontal and vertical components), then the covariant Lie derivative is just the Lie derivative with respect to X over the principal bundle.

Now, if we&#x27;re given a vector field &quot;Y&quot; over &quot;M&quot; (but not the principal bundle) but we also have a connection over the principal bundle, we can define a vector field X over the principal bundle such that its horizontal component matches &quot;Y&quot; and its vertical component agrees with the connection. This is the covariant Lie derivative.

See connection form for more details.

===Nijenhuis–Lie derivative===
Another generalization, due to Albert Nijenhuis, allows one to define the Lie derivative of a differential form along any section of the bundle Ω&quot;k&quot;(&quot;M&quot;, T&quot;M&quot;) of differential forms with values in the tangent bundle. If &quot;K&quot; ∈ Ω&quot;k&quot;(&quot;M&quot;, T&quot;M&quot;) and α is a differential &quot;p&quot;-form, then it is possible to define the interior product &quot;i&quot;&quot;K&quot;α of &quot;K&quot; and α. The Nijenhuis–Lie derivative is then the anticommutator of the interior product and the exterior derivative:
:formula_142

==History==
In 1931, Władysław Ślebodziński introduced a new differential operator, later called by David van Dantzig that of Lie derivation, which can be applied to scalars, vectors, tensors and affine connections and which proved to be a powerful instrument in the study of groups of automorphisms.

The Lie derivatives of general geometric objects (i.e., sections of natural fiber bundles) were studied by A. Nijenhuis, Y. Tashiro and K. Yano.

For a quite long time, physicists had been using Lie derivatives, without reference to the work of mathematicians. In 1940, Léon Rosenfeld—and before him (in 1921) Wolfgang Pauli—introduced what he called a ‘local variation’ formula_143 of a geometric object formula_144 induced by an infinitesimal transformation of coordinates generated by a vector field formula_145. One can easily prove that his formula_143 is formula_147.

<text>Dwight Presbyterian Mission was one of the first American missions to the Native Americans. It was established near present-day Russellville, Arkansas in 1820 to serve the Arkansas Cherokees. After the Cherokee were required to move to Indian Territory in 1828, the mission was reestablished in 1829 near present-day Marble City, Oklahoma. The mission is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
A mission was requested by Tahlonteeskee, the Principal Chief of the Western Cherokees, after he had visited Brainerd Mission in 1818. The mission was founded in August 1820 on Illinois Bayou near present-day Russellville, Arkansas by Cephas Washburn. It was named for Rev. Timothy Dwight, president of Yale College and a corporate member of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. After Tahlonteeskee&#x27;s death in the spring of 1819, the mission was supported by his brother John Jolly.

By 1824, Dwight Mission was a self-contained small town on the frontier. There were at least 24 buildings, including residences for missionaries, students, staff, and visitors; support buildings that included a combination library, post office and pharmacy; a dining hall with kitchen; a storehouse; a blacksmith shop; lathe and carpenter shop; a stable and a barn.

A new treaty between the Cherokees and the United States in 1828 required the Arkansas Cherokees to move to Indian Territory. Therefore, the mission was reestablished in its present-day location, in May 1829, on Sallisaw Creek, near the city of Marble City, Oklahoma. The school opened May 1, 1830. Initially, the facility had a double log house (a building combining school and living quarters) and several log houses to house the staff. Eventually, there would be twenty-one houses, a dining hall, a barn and a number of outbuildings. The mission had more than a dozen staff members and eighty students at the peak of its activity. Its primary mission was to provide an education to Cherokee children and expose them to the Christian religion.

Samuel Worcester served at the mission in 1835, after having worked with the Cherokee as a missionary in Georgia before removal. He created the type for the Cherokee syllabary for their first newspaper, the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot;. In 1837, the first Cherokee language printing press in the then Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) was moved from Union Mission to Dwight Mission. In 1839, the majority of the Cherokee nation was removed to the area from the Southeast on the Trail of Tears.

During the American Civil War, many of the mission&#x27;s buildings were burned down in warfare between pro-Confederate and pro-Union forces. The last religious service was in November 1862. Then it was abandoned. Afterwards, the property was taken over by private owners. By 1884, only two of the original buildings remained.

The Cherokee National Council decided to reopen the school in 1886. The Presbyterian Women&#x27;s Board of Home Missions supplied funds to do this, and a large building was constructed to serve as a boarding school for Cherokee girls. After 1895, it became a day school, then resumed the boarding school concept in 1900, this time for boys and girls.

On January 12, 1918, a fire burned the Dwight Mission School dormitory, destroying the dormitory and killing thirteen students. The students were named as: George Wickett (Cherokee), Nighthawk Mclemore (Cherokee), Phillip Correll (Cherokee), Rufus Young (Cherokee), J. P. Chandler, Jr (Cherokee), Kenneth Crutchfield (Cherokee), Delbert Barnes (Cherokee), Wilson Beaver (Creek), George Tiger (Creek), Robert Daniels (Creek), Solomon Bruner (Creek), Newton Goins (Choctaw), and Gilbert Grants (Omaha). The boys, who were aged 9 to 17, were trapped on a screened porch. Their bodies were returned to their hometowns, and a memorial for them was erected in the Dwight Mission Cemetery.

By 1944, the facility was called Dwight Indian Training School. It was then operated by Board of National Missions of the Presbyterian Church USA, and served seventy-one students, mostly Cherokee and Choctaw.

The school was closed in 1948.

In the fall of 1950, a number of Presbyterian laymen felt that the Synod of Oklahoma should acquire the property and preserve it because of its long association with the Presbyterian Church. They formed Dwight Mission, Inc. and purchased the property on May 6, 1951, for $35,000. Dwight Mission, Inc. and the Synod of Oklahoma managed the daily programs for the next 30 years.

Dwight Mission today operates as a Presbyterian camp, retreat, and conference center between Marble City and Sallisaw, Oklahoma. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Historical markers identify and explain the original location in Arkansas.

In June 2021, Dwight Mission was acquired by the Cherokee Nation.

<doc id="294441" wikidata="Q1101080" url="?curid=294441" title="Is-a">
<text>In knowledge representation and ontology components, including for object-oriented programming and design, is-a (also written as is_a or is a) is a relationship between abstractions (e.g., types, classes), wherein one class &quot;A&quot; is a subclass of another class &quot;B&quot; (and so &quot;B&quot; is a superclass of &quot;A&quot;).
In other words, type A is a subtype of type B when A&#x27;s specification implies B&#x27;s specification. That is, any object (or class) that satisfies A&#x27;s specification also satisfies B&#x27;s specification, because B&#x27;s specification is weaker.

For example, a cat &#x27;is a&#x27; animal, but not vice versa. All cats are animals, but not all animals are cats.
Behaviour that is relevant to all animals is defined on an animal class, whereas behaviour that is relevant only for cats is defined in a cat class. By defining the cat class as &#x27;extending&#x27; the animal class, all cats &#x27;inherit&#x27; the behaviour defined for animals, without the need to explicitly code that behaviour for cats.

== Related concepts ==
The &quot;is-a&quot; relationship is to be contrasted with the &quot;has-a&quot; (&quot;has_a&quot; or &quot;has a&quot;) relationship between types (classes); confusing the relations &quot;has-a&quot; and &quot;is-a&quot; is a common error when designing a model (e.g., a computer program) of the real-world relationship between an object and its subordinate. The &quot;is-a&quot; relationship may also be contrasted with the &quot;instance-of&quot; relationship between objects (instances) and types (classes): see Type–token distinction.

To summarize the relations, there are:

* hyperonym–hyponym (supertype/superclass–subtype/subclass) relations between types (classes) defining a taxonomic hierarchy, where
** for a subsumption relation: a hyponym (subtype, subclass) has a &quot;type-of&quot; (&quot;is-a&quot;) relationship with its hyperonym (supertype, superclass);
* holonym–meronym (whole/entity/container–part/constituent/member) relations between types (classes) defining a possessive hierarchy, where
** for an aggregation (i.e. without ownership) relation:
*** a holonym (whole) has a &quot;has-a&quot; relationship with its meronym (part),
** for a composition (i.e. with ownership) relation:
*** a meronym (constituent) has a &quot;part-of&quot; relationship with its holonym (entity),
** for a containment relation:
*** a meronym (member) has a &quot;member-of&quot; relationship with its holonym (container);
* concept–object (type–token) relations between types (classes) and objects (instances), where
** a token (object) has an &quot;instance-of&quot; relationship with its type (class).

== Examples of subtyping ==

Subtyping enables a given type to be substituted for another type or abstraction. Subtyping is said to establish an is-a relationship between the subtype and some existing abstraction, either implicitly or explicitly, depending on language support. The relationship can be expressed explicitly via inheritance in languages that support inheritance as a subtyping mechanism.

===C++===
The following C++ code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes B and A, where B is both a subclass and a subtype of A, and can be used as an A wherever a B is specified (via a reference, a pointer or the object itself).

class A
{ public:
 void DoSomethingALike() const {}

class B : public A
{ public:
 void DoSomethingBLike() const {}

void UseAnA(A const&amp; some_A)
 some_A.DoSomethingALike();

void SomeFunc()
 B b;
 UseAnA(b); // b can be substituted for an A.


===Python===
The following python code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes and , where is both a subclass and a subtype of , and can be used as an wherever a is required.
class A:
 def do_something_a_like(self):
 pass

class B(A):
 def do_something_b_like(self):
 pass

def use_an_a(some_a):
 some_a.do_something_a_like()

def some_func():
 b = B()
 use_an_a(b) # b can be substituted for an A.
The following example, is a &quot;regular&quot; type, and is a metatype. While as distributed all types have the same metatype (, which is also its own metatype), this is not a requirement. The type of classic classes, known as , can also be considered a distinct metatype.
»&gt; a = 0
»&gt; type(a)
&lt;type &#x27;int&#x27;&gt;
»&gt; type(type(a))
&lt;type &#x27;type&#x27;&gt;
»&gt; type(type(type(a)))
&lt;type &#x27;type&#x27;&gt;
»&gt; type(type(type(type(a))))
&lt;type &#x27;type&#x27;&gt;
===Java===

In Java, is-a relation between the type parameters of one class or interface and the type parameters of another are determined by the extends and implements clauses.

Using the classes, implements , and extends . So is a subtype of , which is a subtype of . The subtyping relationship is preserved between the types automatically. When defining an interface, , that associates an optional value of generic type P with each element, its declaration might look like:
interface PayloadList&lt;E, P&gt; extends List&lt;E&gt; {
 void setPayload(int index, P val);
}
The following parameterizations of PayloadList are subtypes of :
PayloadList&lt;String, String&gt;
PayloadList&lt;String, Integer&gt;
PayloadList&lt;String, Exception&gt;
==Liskov substitution principle==

Liskov substitution principle explains a property, &quot;If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T,&quot;. Following example shows a violation of LSP.

Here is perhaps an example of violation of LSP:
class Rectangle
 public:
 void SetWidth(double w) { itsWidth = w; }
 void SetHeight(double h) { itsHeight = h; }
 double GetHeight() const { return itsHeight; }
 double GetWidth() const { return itsWidth; }
 double GetArea() const { return GetHeight() * GetWidth(); }
 private:
 double itsWidth;
 double itsHeight;

From a programing point of view, the Square class may be implemented by inheriting from the Rectangle class.
public class Square : Rectangle
 public:
 virtual void SetWidth(double w);
 virtual void SetHeight(double h);
void Square::SetWidth(double w)
 Rectangle::SetWidth(w);
 Rectangle::SetHeight(w);
void Square::SetHeight(double h)
 Rectangle::SetHeight(h);
 Rectangle::SetWidth(h);


However, this violates LSP even though the is-a relationship holds between Rectangle and Square

Consider the following example, where function g does not work if a Square is passed in, and so the open-closed principle might be considered to have been violated.
void g(Rectangle&amp; r)
 r.SetWidth(5);
 r.SetHeight(4);
 assert(r.GetArea()) == 20); // assertion will fail


Conversely, if one considers that the type of a shape should only be a constraint on the relationship of its dimensions, then it is the assumption in g() that SetHeight will change height, and area, but not width that is invalid, not just for true squares, but even potentially for other rectangles that might be coded so as to preserve area or aspect ratio when height changes.

<text>Moses Zeh Blah (18 April 1947 – 1 April 2013) was a Liberian politician. He served as the 28th vice president of Liberia under President Charles Taylor and became the 23rd president of Liberia on 11 August 2003, following Taylor&#x27;s resignation. He served as president for two months, until 14 October 2003, when a United Nations-backed transitional government, headed by Gyude Bryant, was established and Bryant was sworn in as Chairman of the Transitional Government of Liberia.

==Career==
Blah was born in Toweh Town, Liberia, a Gio-speaking hamlet in north-eastern Nimba County, close to the border with the Ivory Coast. He joined with Taylor because of a shared hatred of President Samuel Doe, who had killed Blah&#x27;s wife along with hundreds of others in an ethnic-related massacre. He trained with Taylor in a Libyan guerrilla camp and served with him as a general during Liberia&#x27;s civil war in the 1990s. He held the post of ambassador to Libya and Tunisia after Taylor was elected in 1997. In July 2000 Blah was appointed as Vice President after the death of Enoch Dogolea who was rumoured to have been poisoned.

Blah was known as a quiet and unassuming man, driving his own jeep around town rather than using a motorcade and driver, and wearing flowing African robes instead of the normal olive green military uniform. He was constantly annoyed by the presence of bodyguards following him around.

In June 2003, Taylor had left the country for peace talks in Ghana, and while there he was indicted by the war crimes tribunal in Sierra Leone. Blah was urged by the United States to take power from Taylor during his absence, but Blah made no such attempt. After Taylor&#x27;s return, Blah was held under house arrest for ten days, but was subsequently absolved and reinstated as vice president.

When Taylor resigned in August of that year, Blah briefly succeeded him as president. He was condemned by Liberian rebel groups for his close ties to Taylor; they charged that he would simply continue Taylor&#x27;s practices. Blah responded by calling the rebels &quot;brothers&quot; and saying &quot;Let bygones be bygones. If there is power, we can share it.&quot; He invited the rebels to negotiate in his own house.

On 7 April 2008, Blah said that he had been sent a subpoena to testify at Taylor&#x27;s trial before the Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague. He said that he would testify and &quot;speak the truth&quot;, and he testified on 14 May 2008, describing child soldiers and the relationship between Taylor and Foday Sankoh. On 1 February 2009, Blah was accused of taking part in the murder of RUF commander Sam Bockarie, by a witness narrative to the commissioners of Liberia’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). 
The witness, a senior commander of the defunct Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU) of exiled president Charles Taylor, claimed Vice President Blah was part of the conspiracy and participated in the killing of Bockarie in the town of Tiaplay in Nimba County. 

Blah died early on 1 April 2013, at age 65, at the John F. Kennedy Hospital in Monrovia.

<doc id="294447" wikidata="Q237931" url="?curid=294447" title="Marie Walewska">
<text>Marie Walewska, Countess Walewska (née Łączyńska; ; 7 December 1786 – 11 December 1817) was a Polish noblewoman in the court of Napoleon I who used her influence to sway the emperor towards the creation of an independent Polish state. In her later years she married count Philippe Antoine d&#x27;Ornano, an influential Napoleonic officer.

==Early life==
Walewska was born as first child into a wealthy noble family in Kiernozia, to Mathieu (Mateusz) Łączyński, a landowner and starosta of Gostyń; and Eva Zaborowska, whose family was wealthy as well. Walewska had six siblings: Benedykt Jozef, Hieronim, Teodor, Honorata, Katarzyna and Urszula-Teresa. She grew up in her ancestral home, Kiernozia palace, where she received an upper-class education. Nicholas Chopin, Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s father, for instance, was one of her tutors.
In 1794 her father participated in the military struggle for Polish independence and was mortally wounded at the Battle of Maciejowice, leaving behind a widow, seven children (five of them surviving into adulthood), and a dwindling livelihood.

A year later Prussia, the Habsburg monarchy and the Russian Empire effectively ended the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth&#x27;s national sovereignty through the third partition of Poland, when the Łączyński lands were incorporated into Prussia.

As the eldest, with her brothers having debts, it was up to her to secure the future of her family. At the age of eighteen she was married by her mother to the sixty-eight-year-old Athanasius, Count Colonna-Walewski, a wealthy landowner, starosta of Warka district and a once-chamberlain to the last Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski. During their marriage Walewska had two sons, Antoni Rudolf Bazyli, born 14 June 1805, and Alexandre Florian Joseph Colonna-Walewski. Antoni was immediately seized by Marie’s sister-in-law and nieces (by marriage), who were a lot older than the young countess.

Historians have theorized that Alexandre was a natural son of Napoleon I, although Athanasius legally acknowledged him as his own son. In 2013, DNA research supported this belief, indicating Alexandre&#x27;s membership in the genetic male-line of the imperial House of Bonaparte.

== Walewska and Napoleon ==
Maria Walewska met Napoleon for the first time in 1806 in Błonie, or in Jabłonna. According to Maria&#x27;s own memoirs, she spoke briefly with the French emperor in an inn when his carriage was changing horses, but the meeting was inconclusive. However, Napoleon remembered her for her extraordinary conversation and requested to see her in Warsaw, intending to have regular meetings with her. The political context for Poland was complicated; the country had been wiped off the map at the end of the previous century and Polish nationalists were hoping Napoleon might bring the country back to life.

They met again at a ball hosted by count Stanislaw Potocki in his Warsaw residence. Walewska was being advised to work towards a position in the inner circle of Napoleon by the Emperor&#x27;s aide, General Géraud Duroc (Grand Marshal of the Palace). A number of Polish aristocrats asked her the same, hoping that she could influence the emperor to support Poland in its struggle to regain independence from Prussia, the Habsburg Empire and the Russian Empire. In her memoirs, Walewska maintained that she forced herself to get intimately involved with Napoleon for purely patriotic reasons:The sacrifice was complete. It was all about harvesting fruit now, achieving this one single equivalence [convincing Napoleon to support the Polish independence movement], which could excuse my debased position. This was the thought that possessed me. Ruling over my will it did not allow me to fall under the weight of my bad consciousness and sadness.

The intimate relationship was initially kept secret, even though unofficially it was one of the most widely commented on pieces of news in Warsaw&#x27;s higher circles. Walewska visited Napoleon, residing in the capital&#x27;s Royal Castle, only at nights and would secretly leave the building each morning. The relationship progressed when Napoleon moved to his field headquarters in Finckenstein Palace in East Prussia (now Kamieniec Suski, Poland): Walewska followed him there and they moved into neighbouring apartments. As Maria was extraordinarily discreet for her times, they still maintained apparent secrecy: she refused to leave the part of the building in which they lived, fearing being seen by officers surrounding Napoleon, many of whom were her acquaintances or relatives.

According to Madame de Rémusat:

This extraordinary wooing did not, however, prevent the young Polish lady [Marie] from becoming attached to the Emperor, for their liaison was prolonged during several campaigns.

In 1809 Walewska followed Napoleon during his journey to Vienna, where she lived in a house near Schönbrunn Palace, Napoleon&#x27;s residence. During her sojourn in Vienna she became pregnant and returned to Walewice in order to give birth to her second son, Alexandre Joseph. Although Alexandre was rumoured to be the natural son of the Emperor, Count Athanasius officially recognised Alexandre as his son and gave him the name of the counts of Colonna-Walewski.

In 1810 Napoleon returned to Paris, where he was soon joined by Walewska. She settled in a palatial residence in the Rue de Montmorency and was given a large rent of 120,000 francs and a permission to enter all of the imperial museums, but her relationship with Napoleon ended. The Emperor planned to divorce Joséphine and instead arrange a strategic marriage to Marie Louise, daughter of the Austrian Emperor. Maintaining his relationship with Walewska seemed inappropriate to gain that goal. Though Marie Walewska was since presented at the Imperial Court, initially provoking the jealousy of Joséphine, after the divorce she became an intimate friend of the former Empress at Malmaison, frequently bringing her son. Walewska&#x27;s future and that of her son were nevertheless assured by the grant of large land estates in the Kingdom of Naples. On 15 June 1812, at Königsberg, East Prussia, Napoleon signed the letters patent, officially recognizing Alexandre with the title of Count of the Empire.

Following Napoleon&#x27;s first abdication, Walewska traveled to Fontainebleau, where the Emperor had unsuccessfully attempted to end his life. She waited throughout the night in an anteroom for his summons. However, Napoleon recalled her presence only in the morning, by which time she had departed. He remarked, &quot;Poor woman, she will think she was forgotten!&quot; Though he took the time to send her a reassuring note.

During his exile to Elba, on 1 September 1814, Walewska visited the Emperor, bringing their son Alexandre. Napoleon received them discreetly, meeting her and escorting her to the Sanctuary of the Sanctuary of the Madonna del Monte, a secluded convent above Marciana. He had set up a tent in the garden to host his guests. The visit was cut short due to rumors on the island mistaking her for the Empress and their son for the King of Rome. To prevent scandal, she departed to the mainland.

After the Hundred Days, Walewska and her son visited Napoleon once more at Malmaison for a tearful farewell before his departure to Saint Helena. Joséphine&#x27;s daughter, Hortense, invited her to stay for lunch to prevent people to observe her in such a state.

== Later years ==

In 1812 Maria divorced Count Athanasius Walewski. To facilitate it, her brother, Benedykt Jozef, admitted to forcing the marriage upon her. It remains unclear whether this was the truth, as in her memoirs Maria stated that her mother influenced her choice to marry Athanasius. As a settlement, she and her oldest son received half of Count Walewski&#x27;s estates, which even though heavily indebted, represented considerable wealth.

In 1816 Maria married her longtime admirer and lover, Count Philippe Antoine d&#x27;Ornano. They settled in Liège, as d&#x27;Ornano did not want to return to Paris due to his pro-Napoleonic allegiances. In 1817 Maria gave birth to d&#x27;Ornano&#x27;s son, Rudolph Augustus. She died in Paris shortly afterwards due to a prolonged kidney illness. Before her death, she completed her memoirs, which were addressed to her husband. Upon request from her Polish relatives her body was exhumed from Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and moved to her family crypt in Kiernozia.

== Descendants ==
Maria Walewska left three sons:
* Her son from the first marriage, count Antoni Colonna-Walewski, settled in Poland and little is known about his life.
* Count Alexandre Joseph Colonna-Walewski (4 May 1810 – 27 October 1868), her son from her relationship with Napoleon I who became an important figure in 19th century French politics: he was an influential diplomat and a cabinet minister. He maintained his whole life that his father was Count Colonna-Walewski.
* Her third son, Rodolphe-Auguste d&#x27;Ornano, was also an influential figure in the French society; his descendants created the well-known fragrance and cosmetics brand Sisley.

Marie Walewska also had a niece, named Barth, who lived in Bergen, Norway. The Walewska family thus has descendants in Norway living today.

== Legacy ==
Walewska&#x27;s eventful life attracted attention of a number of Polish and French historians. As her memoirs remained unpublished until the late 19th century, she was a subject of much speculation. The first scholar to write a complete account of her life was a French biographer Frederic Masson, who was allowed by d&#x27;Ornano family to use her memoirs.

In the 1930s her adventures were once again described by her descendant, Antoine Philippe Rodolphe, 4th count d&#x27;Ornano in a book entitled &quot;Marie Walewska, &quot;l&#x27;épouse polonaise de Napolėon&quot;&quot;. It was a belletristic biography that until the mid-20th century was considered as a key source on Walewska, as Antoine d&#x27;Ornano claimed that it was based on never published documents remaining in the archives of La Branchoire, the family castle.

Count d&#x27;Ornano&#x27;s account presented Maria as a devout patriot and an influential political figure. His book claimed that she was involved in taking major political decisions related to the development of Duchy of Warsaw and engaged herself in disputes with figures such as Józef Poniatowski or Joachim Lelewel. These allegations spurred controversy among Polish historians, who noticed that both the described events and the dates quoted by d&#x27;Ornano seemed unlikely.

Biographer Marian Brandys attempted to deal with some of these doubts in his book &quot;The troubles with Lady Walewska&quot; and he went as far as questioning the very existence of documents from La Branchoire. His main argument was that the facts presented in the book were unrealistic in light of broader historical knowledge about Napoleonic campaigns and the politics of the Duchy of Warsaw. He also noted the numerous discrepancies between the French and English editions of the book.

== Lawsuit ==
D&#x27;Ornano&#x27;s book had an equally profound effect on the historian circles in France. In the 1950s Jean Savant, a renowned historian and writer, wrote a book about Walewska in which he attempted to recreate a scientific biography of Maria Walewska. Before publishing the book, he printed certain extracts from it in &quot;Elle&quot;, a popular woman&#x27;s magazine, which resulted in a lawsuit from count d&#x27;Ornano and his descendants.

The dispute revolved around copyright issues: Savant allowed the publication of extracts from his work, which included alleged excerpts from Maria&#x27;s own accounts, taken from d&#x27;Ornano&#x27;s book. However, he failed to appropriately reference them. Antoine d&#x27;Ornano sued him for illegally appropriating contents taken from &quot;Marie Walewska, &quot;l&#x27;épouse polonaise de Napolėon&quot;&quot;, and when Antoine died, his descendants claimed that the aforementioned extracts were not historical source materials, as Savant claimed, but merely an invention of the author. The legal battle continued for a few years, and it was put to an end by Cour de Cassation which decided that Savant acted legally.

The d&#x27;Ornano family never allowed any historian to come into contact with the alleged Walewska archives. During the lawsuit they maintained that, in fact, the documents never existed. However, Savant in his next book &quot;L&#x27;Affaire Walewska&quot; attempted to prove the contrary.

== Marie Walewska in film ==
Walewska was the subject of the 1914 Polish film &quot;Countess Walewska&quot;, directed by Aleksander Hertz.

Her story is also told in a 1937 film &quot;Conquest&quot;, also known as &quot;Marie Walewska&quot;. Greta Garbo plays Marie Walewska to Charles Boyer&#x27;s Napoleon. Boyer and art director Cedric Gibbons were both nominated for Academy Awards for the film.

The character also appeared in &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Farewell&quot;, an episode of the BBC comedy &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. She was played by Alexandra Lara in the 2002 &quot;Napoléon&quot; miniseries.

<text>Zipporah is mentioned in the Book of Exodus as the wife of Moses, and the daughter of Jethro, the priest and prince of Midian.

She is the mother of Moses&#x27; two sons: Eliezer, and Gershom.

In the Book of Chronicles, two of her grandsons are mentioned: Shebuel, son of Gershom; and Rehabiah, son of Eliezer ().

==Biblical narrative==
===Background===
In the Book of Exodus, Zipporah was one of the seven daughters of Jethro, a Kenite shepherd who was a priest of Midian. In , Jethro is also referred to as Reuel, and in the Book of Judges () as Hobab. Hobab is also the name of Jethro&#x27;s son in .

===Moses marries Zipporah===
While the Israelites/Hebrews were captives in Egypt, Moses killed an Egyptian who was striking a Hebrew, for which offense Pharaoh sought to kill Moses. Moses therefore fled from Egypt and arrived in Midian. One day while he sat by a well, Jethro&#x27;s daughters came to water their father&#x27;s flocks. Other shepherds arrived and drove the girls away, so that they could water their own flocks first. Moses defended the girls and watered their flocks. Upon their return home, their father asked them, &quot;How is it that you have come home so early today?&quot; The girls answered, &quot;An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds; he even drew water for us and watered the flock.&quot; &quot;Where is he then?&quot;, Jethro asked them. &quot;Why did you leave the man? Invite him for supper to break bread.&quot; Jethro then gave Moses Zipporah as his wife ().

===Incident at the inn===

After God commanded Moses to return to Egypt to free the Israelites, Moses took his wife and sons and started his journey. On the road, they stayed at an inn, where God came to kill Moses. Zipporah quickly circumcised her son with a sharp stone and touched Moses&#x27; feet with the foreskin, saying &quot;Surely you are a husband of blood to me!&quot; God then left Moses alone (). The details of the passage are unclear and subject to debate.

===The Exodus===

After Moses succeeded in leading the Israelites out of Egypt, and won a battle against Amalek, Jethro came to the Hebrew camp in the wilderness of Sinai, bringing with him Zipporah and their two sons, Gershom and Eliezer. The Bible does not say when Zipporah and her sons rejoined Jethro, only that after he heard of what God did for the Israelites, he brought Moses&#x27; family to him. The most common translation is that Moses sent her away, but another grammatically permissible translation is that she sent things or persons, perhaps the announcement of the victory over Amalek. The word that makes this difficult is &quot;shelucheiha&quot;, the sendings [away] of her ().

====Numbers 12====
Moses&#x27; wife is referred to as a &quot;Cushite woman&quot; in . Interpretations differ on whether this was one and the same as Zipporah, or another woman, and whether he was married to them simultaneously, or successively. In the story, Aaron and Miriam criticize Moses&#x27; marriage to a Cushite woman. This criticism displeases God, who punishes Miriam with &quot;tzaraath&quot; (often glossed as leprosy). Cushites were of the ancestry of either Kush (Nubia) in northeast Africa, or Arabians. The sons of Ham, mentioned within the Book of Genesis, have been identified with nations in Africa (Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya), the Levant (Canaan), and Arabia. The Midianites themselves were later depicted at times in non-Biblical sources as dark-skinned and called &quot;Kushim&quot;, a Hebrew word used for dark-skinned Africans. One interpretation is that the wife is Zipporah, and that she was referred to as a Cushite though she was a Midianite, because of her beauty.

The text of Numbers preserves only consonants. Jewish reading traditions pronounce the description of Moses&#x27;s wife as &quot;kushit&quot; meaning &quot;the Cushite woman&quot;. However, the oral reading tradition of the Samaritan Pentateuch pronounces the description of Moses&#x27;s wife as &quot;kaashet,&quot; which translates to &quot;the beautiful woman.&quot;

&quot;Cushite woman&quot; becomes Αἰθιόπισσα in the Greek Septuagint (3rd century BCE) and &quot;Aethiopissa&quot; in the Latin Vulgate Bible version (4th century). Alonso de Sandoval, 17th century Jesuit, reasoned that Zipporah and the Cushite woman was the same person, and that she was black. He puts her in a group of what he calls &quot;notable and sainted Ethiopians&quot;.

==In the Druze religion==
In the Druze religion, Zipporah&#x27;s father Jethro is revered as the spiritual founder, chief prophet, and ancestor of all Druze. Moses was allowed to wed Zipporah after helping save Jethro&#x27;s daughters and their flock from competing herdsmen. It has been expressed by prominent Druze such as Amal Nasser el-Din and Salman Tarif, who was a prominent Druze shaykh, that this makes the Druze related to the Jews through marriage. This view has been used to represent an element of the special relationship between Israeli Jews and Druze.

==In literature and the arts==
Like many other prominent biblical characters, Zipporah is depicted in several works of art.

In Marcel Proust&#x27;s story &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot; (1913), Swann is struck by the resemblance of his eventual wife Odette to Sandro Botticelli’s painting of Zipporah in a Sistine Chapel fresco, and this recognition is the catalyst for his obsession with her.

Zipporah is often included in Exodus-related drama. Examples include the films &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; (1998), and &quot;&quot; (2014). She is the main character in Marek Halter&#x27;s novel &quot;Zipporah, Wife of Moses&quot; (2005).

<doc id="294452" wikidata="Q106180141" url="?curid=294452" title="Cute hoor">
<text>Cute hoor and, by extension, &quot;cute hoorism&quot;, is a cultural concept in Ireland where a certain level of corruption is forgiven - or sometimes even applauded - of politicians or businessmen. This phenomenon is sometimes attributed to postcolonialism and emigration in Ireland, but also to how historically passive income and patronage were favoured, in culture and in public policy, over entrepreneurship. But the concept also references how years of net emigration had led to a situation where having a network of powerful contacts created more opportunities for a school or college leaver than work ethic, talent or academic achievement.

Cute hoorism in politics has also come to refer to the phenomenon where, because of Ireland&#x27;s multi-seat constituency proportional representation, single transferable vote system, political candidates often face more of a threat in re-election from a running mate in their party than from a rival in a party with substantially different political policies. Typically, a successful method of besting a rival with identical political beliefs is by being seen to be better at dealing with parish pump issues. 

However, the phrase &quot;cute hoor&quot; is used more widely than this in politics in Ireland, particularly when referring to cynical tactics in general, such as the difference between pre-election campaigning and post-election coalition-forming. 

== Etymology ==
The phrase &quot;cute hoor&quot; is exemplary in Hiberno-English as it represents three different categories of the dialect: an English word with a distinct meaning in Ireland (cute, meaning shrewd), an Irish neologism in English based on Irish phonetics (hoor, derived from whore) and a compound phrase with a distinct meaning of its own (cute hoor). In the entry for &quot;hoor&quot;, Dolan notes &quot;it may be used affectionately as well as pejoratively, especially when qualified by the adjective &#x27;cute&#x27;... &#x27;that man&#x27;s such a cute hoor he&#x27;d build a nest in your ear&#x27;&quot;.

The distinction between &quot;whore&quot; and &quot;hoor&quot; was significant enough for a discussion about it to be entered into Ireland&#x27;s parliamentary record.

== History ==
On 10 March 1983, the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; ran an article on Terry Leyden (with reference to him and his running mate Seán Doherty) in which the phrase was first used in print:&quot;Few politicians understand the punters better than either. In local parlance they are cute &quot;hoors&quot;. But it is hard to say which is the cutest... in spite of national swings against Fianna Fáil they have managed to hold onto two out of the three seats n Roscommon over the past four elections... If their political know-how could be repeated by Fianna Fail in other marginals Charlie Haughey would never have lost power.&quot; A few months later, &#x27;cute hoor&#x27; was first entered in the Dáil record on 3 July 1983 by George Birmingham: &quot;When the choice is presented to them between leadership and stroking, between courage and cowardice, vision and the philosophy of &quot;the &lt;mark&gt;cute&lt;/mark&gt; &lt;mark&gt;hoor&lt;/mark&gt;&quot;, I have no doubt as to whom they will choose. The people have enough confidence in themselves to respond to leadership which is and will be on offer in 15 months&#x27; time.&quot;In both instances, the implication (by rival politicians and journalists) was that cute hoor politicians had improved their careers by prioritising local concerns over the national interest. The phrase accelerated in use during the 1980s and 1990s when repeated coalition governments collapsed after corruption scandals or because the support of independent politicians was withdrawn.

== Re-election of controversial politicians ==
While politics in Ireland in the 1990s was focused on high-minded goals such as building the Celtic Tiger and the Peace process, at the ground level matters relating to political corruption were collapsing governments and being discussed in election debates. Many issues relating to corruption in planning and public procurement were investigated by tribunals such as the Moriarty Tribunal or the Mahon Tribunal. However, these tribunals did not often lead to criminal convictions and many politicians identified as having acted in an improper manner not only were re-elected but were in a position to leverage a coalition as an independent T.D.

The following are examples where the term has been applied in the Irish media in reference to a politician being re-elected after a controversy. 

=== Michael Lowry ===
The 1997 McCracken Tribunal revealed that supermarket tycoon Ben Dunne had paid IR£395,000 for an extension to Michael Lowry&#x27;s home in Tipperary. The Tribunal concluded that Lowry had evaded tax. This allegation prompted his resignation from the Cabinet in November 1996. Taoiseach John Bruton announced that Lowry would not be allowed to stand as a Fine Gael candidate at the next election, and he resigned from the party.

Lowry announced that he would stand as an independent candidate at the 1997 general election. He topped the poll in his Tipperary North constituency at that election, doing so again at the 2002, 2007 and 2011 general elections, and yet again in Tipperary at the general elections of 2016 and 2020.

=== Mick Wallace ===
Mick Wallace, an Independent TD, refused to resign his seat after admitting to tax evasion in 2012, stating “I am answerable to the people of Wexford who elected me, and they will discard me when they see fit”. He was re-elected in 2016.

=== Boris Johnson ===
In 2019, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; asked if Boris Johnson was Britain&#x27;s first cute hoor Prime Minister, noting &quot;Swap a hurl for a cricket bat, the word “Brussels” for “Dublin”, and Johnson would be right at home in a back bar in south Kerry, waging a derisory finger at “them up in Dublin” with one hand and knocking back a pint with the other. Their electorate is the same - tired of being condescended to by elites in a remote city, they respond well to a sly dog who they reckon can get them a good deal&quot;.

== Supporting a party in governing after resigning from that party ==
The following politicians resigned from a political party but later supported that party in government in exchange for leverage:

=== Jackie Healy-Rae ===
When Fianna Fáil refused to nominate Jackie Healy-Rae as a candidate in Kerry South, he decided to run as an Independent candidate in 1997. This move surprised the party, with many commentators giving him little chance of getting elected. However, Healy-Rae took a seat and denied Fianna Fáil the chance of taking a second seat in the constituency. However, once elected he was in a better negotiating position with the Fianna Fáil-led coalition as an independent than he would have been as a government backbencher. Healy-Rae was one of four Independent TDs (the others were Harry Blaney, Tom Gildea and Mildred Fox) who supported the government throughout its five-year term. In return for this support he secured funding for projects in his constituency and chairmanship of the Environment committee. Many of the projects, such as road improvements, involved contracts or contract lots tendered by Kerry County Council being awarded to Healy-Rae&#x27;s plant-hire business.

Healy-Rae&#x27;s high profile and perceived influence over the government received much coverage, and in the next general election fifteen independent TDs were returned to Dáil Éireann.

Mattie McGrath - former member of Fianna Fáil

Shane Ross - former member of Fine Gael

== Advancing local interests ==
The issue of using making decisions as a government minister which benefit that minister&#x27;s own constituency is a controversial one, because elected representatives from disadvantaged areas are expected to seek additional services or investment in that area. However, when this is done egregiously it is seen as a symptom of cute hoor politics.

=== Tom Parlon ===
In December 2003, Tom Parlon was attacked by other government politicians for claiming the controversial civil service decentralisation plan being implemented was because of his decision, when in fact he had no input into the plan at all and was only a junior by-stander. Parlon, with advance knowledge, erected prominent &quot;Welcome to Parlon country&quot; posters in his constituency as soon as the announcement was made. Also in taking up his position as Director General of the Construction Industry Federation in 2007, after having a prominent position in the Office of Public Works, led to accusations of a conflict of interest.

In 2008, Parlon publicly took credit for effecting a policy reversal by the Department of Finance on the procurement procedure for State building projects. After his lobbying, Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan agreed to allow €150m of water service projects to go ahead under old &quot;costs plus&quot; contracts rather than the &quot;fixed price&quot; contracts. In fact, the reversal was due to an administrative decision amongst local authorities and not as a consequence of any lobbying.

<text>Washington Montgomery Bartlett (February 29, 1824 – September 12, 1887) was an American politician who served as the 16th governor of California from January 1887 until his death in September of that year, as well as the 20th mayor of San Francisco from 1883 to 1887. He was the first Jewish governor of any U.S. state and – to date – the only Jewish governor of California. Bartlett converted to Congregationalism on his deathbed and was buried as a Christian.

== Biography==
Bartlett was born in Savannah, Georgia on February 29, 1824, the son of Sarah E. Melhado and Cosam Emir Bartlett. His mother was a Sephardic Jew. Unlike the second elected Jewish governor, Moses Alexander of Idaho, Bartlett was not particularly religious and did not participate in Jewish observances while in California.

A lifelong bachelor and a printer by trade, he became a lawyer as well. During his lifetime Bartlett was a San Francisco newspaper publisher, San Francisco County Clerk, California state senator, mayor of San Francisco from 1883-87, and finally governor, elected in 1886.

Bartlett was sworn in as governor and gave his inaugural address on January 8, 1887. He died of Bright&#x27;s disease barely eight months into his term, on September 12, 1887. His service as governor was the second shortest in California&#x27;s history as a state; only Milton S. Latham, who served just five days in 1860, had a shorter tenure. 

Bartlett&#x27;s funeral was conducted at Trinity Episcopal Church in San Francisco. He is buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.

<text>Sandford C. Faulkner (March 3, 1803August 4, 1874), better known as Sandy Faulkner, was an American planter, raconteur and fiddler who personified the mid-19th century folk song &quot;Arkansas Traveler,&quot; for which he received writing credit. It has since gone on to become the official state historic song of Arkansas.

== Biography ==
Sandford C. Faulkner was born in Georgetown, Kentucky, on March 3, 1803 to Nicholas and Sally () Faulkner. He was responsible in large part for the story forming the basis of the &quot;Arkansas Traveler,&quot; which was the official song of Arkansas from 1949 to 1963, and the official state historic song of Arkansas since 1987. During the American Civil War, Faulkner served as an artillery officer detailed to ordnance duty in the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederate States Army. 

From November 1862 to August 1863, Faulkner served as the commanding officer of the Little Rock Arsenal. In late September 1863, The Little Rock facility relocated to Tyler, Texas, and was redesignated Tyler Ordnance Works. On October 1 of the same year, the Little Rock ordnance stores were turned over to Lieutenant-Colonel G. H. Hill, officer in charge at Tyler. Faulkner was then assigned as commanding officer of the ordnance depot at Marshall, Texas, and served there to the end of the war.

== Honors ==
Faulkner County, Arkansas (established 1873) is named after him.

<text>Othryoneus (Ancient Greek: Ὀθρυονεύς) is a character in Greek mythology who was the intended husband Princess Cassandra of Troy during the Trojan War, mentioned in one passage in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;.

Othryoneus was from Cabesos, a Homeric site over whose location there has been disagreements since ancient times, some sources suggesting a site in the Troad self and others pointing at the very similar name of the ancient site of Kavissos, today near Feres near Evros. Othryoneus had taken part in the war in the sole purpose of marrying King Priam&#x27;s daughter, the &quot;loveliest&quot; according to Homer, and to which the King had assented. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, he is killed during the Battle of the Ships by Idomeneus, in a passage in which he is cited as gleefully mocking him while Othryoneus is dying.

<doc id="294461" wikidata="Q8022" url="?curid=294461" title="Generalitat de Catalunya">
<text>The Generalitat de Catalunya (; ; ), or the Government of Catalonia, is the institutional system by which Catalonia is self-governed as an autonomous community of Spain. It is made up of the Parliament of Catalonia, the President of the Government of Catalonia, and the Executive Council of Catalonia (or council of ministers, also very often referred to as &quot;Govern&quot;, &quot;Government&quot;). Its current powers are set out in the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 2006.

The origins of the Generalitat are in the 13th century when permanent councils of deputies (deputations) were created to rule administration of the Courts of the different realms that formed the Crown of Aragon which gave birth to the Deputation of the General of the Principality of Catalonia (1359), the Deputation of the General of the Kingdom of Aragon (1362) and the Deputation of the General of the Kingdom of Valencia (1412). The modern Generalitat was established in 1931, as the institution of self-government of Catalonia within the Spanish Republic. After the end of the Civil War in 1940 the President was executed and the Generalitat abolished. Notwithstanding, the presidency went into exile until it was reestablished in 1977.

Its headquarters are at the Palau de la Generalitat, in the city of Barcelona.

==History==

Catalonia&#x27;s political past as a territorially differentiated community with its own representative and separated institutions, materialized in the institutional systems of the combined Catalan counties (9th–12th centuries), the Principality of Catalonia within the Crown of Aragon (1164–1714) and the Monarchy of Spain (1516–1714/1833), as well the establishment of Catalan self-government from 1931 onwards, can be divided into different stages, separated by ruptures in the legal/public order.

The Generalitat of Catalonia can trace its origins in the Catalan Courts, as during the reign of James I the Conqueror (1208–1276) they reunited and were convoked by the king, as representatives of the social statements of the time. Under the reign of Peter the Great (1276–1285), the Catalan Courts gained institutional status, after the king obliged himself to celebrate an annual &quot;General Court&quot;. The Catalan Courts exercised as Council and had legislative functions through its three branches (&quot;braços&quot;): the ecclesiastical (clergy), the military (nobility) and the popular (villages and towns submitted to direct rule of the king). This union of the tree branches was named &quot;Lo General de Cathalunya&quot;, where &quot;General&quot; means the political community of the Catalans as a whole.

In 1289 the first step towards becoming an institution occurred when the courts met in the castle of Montsó. (Although located in the Kingdom of Aragon, Montsó had been ruled by the Count of Barcelona since the year 1151 AD when Count Ramon Berenguer IV married Princess Petronilla of Aragon). A body was appointed, designated the &quot;Diputació del General&quot; (Deputation of the General), to temporarily collect the &quot;services&quot; or tributes that the &quot;branches&quot; granted the king on his demand. This tax was popularly known as &quot;&quot;Drets Generals&quot; (General Rights) or &quot;generalitats&quot;&quot; (generalities), similar to the French &quot;Généralités&quot;, which were also founded as tax districts.

=== Medieval origins ===

The &quot;Pau i Treva de Déu&quot; (&quot;Peace and Truce of God&quot;) was a social movement born in the eleventh century promoted by the Church, united with the peasantry as the response to the violence perpetrated by feudal nobles. The hometowns, then, delimited a space protected of feudal violence. However, to ensure a coexistence climate, it was necessary to go further, establishing an authority that prohibited the practice of any type of violent act anywhere in the territory. This was the objective of the assemblies of Peace and Truce of God, the first of which, in the Catalan counties, took place in Toluges (Roussillon), in 1027, under the presidency of Abbot Oliba, on behalf of Bishop Berenguer d&#x27;Elna, absent from the diocese because he was on a pilgrimage. The origin of the Catalan Courts can be considered from the Peace of Truce of God.

The Generalitat of Catalonia stems from the medieval institution which ruled, in the name of the King as Count of Barcelona, some aspects of the administration of the Principality of Catalonia. The Catalan Courts were the main institution of the Principality during its existence as a polity and approved the Catalan constitutions. The first constitutions were that of the Courts of 1283.

The Medieval precedent of the Generalitat, the &quot;Diputació del General de Catalunya&quot; (&quot;Deputation of the General of Catalonia&quot;) was a permanent council of deputies established by the Courts in order to collect the new &quot;tax of the General&quot; (or tribute for the King) in 1359. The &quot;general&quot; refers to the combination of the three estates: nobility, church and people. The tax became known was the &quot;drets del General&quot; or &quot;Generalitats&quot;. The council gained important political power during the next centuries, assuming tasks including that of prosecutor. In 1931, the name Generalitat was chosen by the legislators of the new self government to help legitimise their function.

===First abolition===
Catalan institutions which depended on the Generalitat were abolished in what is currently known in Catalonia as Northern Catalonia, one year after the signature of the Treaty of the Pyrenees in the 17th century, which transferred the territory from Spanish to French sovereignty.

Then, by the early 18th century, with the issue of the &quot;Nueva Planta Decrees&quot; after the Catalan defeat in the War of the Spanish Succession, the institution, as well as the other political institutions of the Principality, was abolished.

===First restoration===

The Generalitat was restored in the Catalonia under Spanish administration in 1931 during the events of the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic when Francesc Macià, leader of the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), declared the Catalan Republic within an Iberian Federation on 14 April but later reached an agreement with the Spanish ministers, in which the Catalan Republic was renamed Generalitat of Catalonia (Catalan: Generalitat de Catalunya) and given its modern political and representative function as the institution of self-government of Catalonia within the Spanish Republic. The restored Generalitat was ruled by a statute of autonomy approved by the Spanish Cortes in 1932 and included a parliament, a presidency, an executive council and a court of cassation. It was presided by Francesc Macià (1931–1933) and Lluís Companys (1933–1940). The governments of Macià and Companys enacted a progressive agenda, despite the internal difficulties, while fought to demand the complete transfer of the powers estipulated in the Statute.

After the right wing coalition won the Spanish elections in 1933, the leftist leaders of the Generalitat of Catalonia rebelled in October of 1934 against the Spanish authorities, and it was temporarily suspended from 1934 to 1936. After the victory of the left in the Spanish elections of February 1936 the new Spanish government pardoned the Catalan government and the self-government was fully restored.

Throughout the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) the Generalitat remained loyal to the Republic, assuming powers in areas belonging to the State in Catalonia, such as border controls, coinage, justice and defense. However, due to the revolutionary situation created after the coup d&#x27;etat, the Generalitat lost most of the effective power over the territory, largely controlled by local committees under the command of the Central Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia. As the weeks passed, the Catalan government progressively recovered somewhat control until May 1937.

===Second abolition===
In 1939, as the Spanish Civil War finished with the defeat of the Republican side, the Generalitat of Catalonia as an institution was abolished and remained so during the Francoist dictatorship until 1975. The president of the Generalitat at the time, Lluís Companys, was tortured and executed on 15 October 1940 for the crime of &#x27;military rebellion&#x27;. Nonetheless, the Generalitat maintained its official existence in exile, led by presidents Josep Irla (1940–1954) and Josep Tarradellas (1954–1980).

===Second restoration===
The succession of presidents of the Generalitat was maintained in exile from 1939 to 1977, when Josep Tarradellas returned to Catalonia and was recognized as the legitimate president by the Spanish government. Tarradellas, when he returned to Catalonia, made his often quoted remark &quot;Ciutadans de Catalunya: ja sóc aquí&quot; (&quot;Citizens of Catalonia: I am back!&quot;), reassuming the autonomous powers of Catalonia, one of the historic nationalities of present-day Spain.

After this, the powers given to the autonomous Catalan government according to the Spanish Constitution of 1978 were transferred and the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (&quot;Estatut d&#x27;Autonomia&quot;) was passed after being approved both by referendum in Catalonia and by the Spanish parliament.

== Recent history ==

=== Governance since 2006 ===

José Montilla, leader of the Catalan Socialist Party, was the president of the Generalitat from the 2006 election until November 2010, leading a tripartite coalition of left-wing and Catalan nationalist political parties.

On 18 June 2006, a reformed version of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia was approved by referendum and went into effect in August. The reform of the Statute was initially promoted by both the leftist parties in the Catalan government and by the main opposition party (CiU), which were united in pushing for increased devolution of powers from the Spanish government level, enhanced fiscal autonomy and finances, and explicit recognition of Catalonia&#x27;s national identity. However the details of the Statute&#x27;s final version were harshly fought over and continued to be controversial. At length, the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), themselves members of the coalition government, finally opposed the Statute in the referendum.

In 2010, the Spanish Constitutional Court reduced the Statute, eliminating or reinterpreting more than 200 articles, following a signature campaign organised by then the Spanish opposition leader, Mariano Rajoy. The Court&#x27;s decision is considered one of the main reasons for the independence boom that happened from 2010 with 8% support to 2018 with 52.4% of support.

Artur Mas held the office of President of the Generalitat from December 2010 until his resignation in January 2016, leading a minority government dependent on pacts with other parties including the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia following the 2010 election and the 2015 election.

Former president Artur Mas was charged by the Spanish government for civil disobedience, after he organised and staged a referendum on independence in 2014.

=== Current status ===
In 2016, Carles Puigdemont, member of the Catalan European Democratic Party, successor formation to the defunct Convergence and Union alliance. was elected President of the Generalitat of Catalonia. He was suspended from office on 27 October 2017, by the Spanish government.

After a number of attempts to invest a new president, Quim Torra became president on 17 May 2018, with Together for Catalonia and Republican Left of Catalonia votes in favor.

On 22 May 2021, Pere Aragonès from the Republican Left of Catalonia was elected the 132nd president of the Generalitat.

==Autonomous system of government==

The autonomous government consists of the Executive Council, the President and the Parliament. Some people wrongly apply this name only to the executive council (the cabinet of the autonomous government); however, &quot;Generalitat de Catalunya&quot; is the system of Catalan autonomous government as a whole.

The region has gradually achieved a greater degree of autonomy since 1979. After Navarre and the Basque Country regions, Catalonia has the greatest level of self-government in Spain. When it is fully instated, the &quot;Generalitat&quot; holds exclusive and wide jurisdiction in various matters of culture, environment, communications, transportation, commerce, public safety and local governments. In many aspects relating to education, health and justice, the region shares jurisdiction with the Spanish government.

One of the examples of Catalonia&#x27;s degree of autonomy is its own police force, the &quot;Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra&quot; (&quot;Auxiliary Force&quot;), which has taken over most of the police functions in Catalonia which used to be served by the Civil Guard &quot;(Guardia Civil)&quot; and the Spanish National Police Corps.

With few exceptions, most of the justice system is administered by national judicial institutions. The legal system is uniform throughout the Spanish state, with the exception of some parts of civil law – especially family, inheritance, and real estate law – that have traditionally been ruled by so-called foral law. The fields of civil law that are subject to autonomous legislation have been codified in the Civil Code of Catalonia &quot;(Codi civil de Catalunya)&quot; consisting of six books that have successively entered into force since 2003.

Another institution stemming from the Catalan autonomy statute, but independent from the &quot;Generalitat&quot; in its check and balance functions, is the &quot;Síndic de Greuges&quot; (ombudsman) to address problems that may arise between private citizens or organizations and the Generalitat or local governments.

=== Legislature ===

The Parliament of Catalonia (Catalan: ) is the unicameral legislative body of the Generalitat and represents the people of Catalonia. Its 135members (&quot;diputats&quot;) are elected by universal suffrage to serve for a four-year period. According to the Statute of Autonomy, it has powers to legislate over devolved matters such as education, health, culture, internal institutional and territorial organization, nomination of the President of the Generalitat and control the Government, budget and other affairs. The last Catalan election was held on 12 May 2024, and its current speaker (&quot;president&quot;) is Josep Rull, incumbent since 11 June 2024.

=== Presidency ===

The President of the Generalitat of Catalonia (Catalan: ) is the highest representative of Catalonia, and is also responsible of leading the government&#x27;s action, presiding the Executive Council. Since the restoration of the Generalitat on the return of democracy in Spain, the Presidents of Catalonia have been Josep Tarradellas (1977–1980, president in exile since 1954), Jordi Pujol (1980–2003), Pasqual Maragall (2003–2006), José Montilla (2006–2010), Artur Mas (2010–2016), Carles Puigdemont (2016–2017) and, after the imposition of direct rule from Madrid, Quim Torra (2018–2020), Pere Aragonès (2020–2024) and Salvador Illa (2024–).

=== Executive ===

The Executive Council (Catalan: ) or Government (), is the body responsible of the government of the Generalitat, it holds executive and regulatory power, being accountable to the Catalan Parliament. It comprises the President of the Generalitat, the First Minister () or the Vice President, and the ministers () appointed by the president. Its seat is the Palau de la Generalitat, Barcelona. The current government is formed by the center-left pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) after a political crisis in which the center-right member of the coalition Together for Catalonia (Junts) abandoned in 2022 its ministerial seats. It is made up of 14 ministers, alongside to the President and a secretary of government.

==International presence==

As an autonomous community of Spain, Catalonia is not recognized as a sovereign state by any sovereign state. However, as Catalonia has progressively gained a greater degree of self-government in recent years, the Catalan Government has established nearly bilateral relationships with foreign bodies. For the most part, these relationships are with the governments of other powerful subnational entities such as Quebec or California. In addition, like most Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia has permanent delegations before international organizations, such as the European Union.

More recently, Catalonia has embarked upon an expansion process of its international representation by opening a number of delegations worldwide. As of 2017, these exceeded 40. Most of these offices are located in major world cities like London, New York City, Los Angeles, Paris, Tokyo and others. Each office has specific duties assigned by their ministry or department agency. Generally, the functions of these are the representation of specific interests of the Government of Catalonia, trade and foreign investment, Catalan culture and language support, tourist promotion, and international cooperation activities.

There are no specific Catalan political institutions in Northern Catalonia, other than the French &quot;département&quot; of Pyrénées-Orientales. However, since 5 September 2003, there has been a &quot;Casa de la Generalitat&quot; in Perpignan, which aims to promote the Catalan culture and facilitate exchanges between each side of the Franco–Spanish border.

Under application of article 155 of the Constitution following the constitutional crisis of 2017 Catalonia only retained one delegation abroad, after the rest were closed, this delegation was the one of Brussels, Belgium. The Catalan Government elected after 21 December election began the process to restore the closed delegations, achivering the goal and opening new ones. Currently there are 15 fully deployed delegations.

This is the list of the current delegations of the Government of Catalonia abroad:

* Brussels, Belgium (delegation before the European Union)
* Andorra la Vella, Andorra
* Buenos Aires, Argentina
* Vienna, Austria
* Zagreb, Croatia
* Paris, France
