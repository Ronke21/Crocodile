Some of his most notable works include &quot;Tomie&quot;, a series chronicling an immortal girl who drives her stricken admirers to madness; &quot;Uzumaki&quot;, a three-volume series about a town cursed by spirals; and &quot;Gyo&quot;, a two-volume story in which fish are controlled by a strain of sentient bacteria called &quot;the death stench.&quot; His other works include &quot;The Junji Ito Horror Comic Collection&quot;, a collection of his many short stories, and &quot;Junji Ito&#x27;s Cat Diary: Yon &amp; Mu&quot;, a self-parody about him and his wife living in a house with two cats.

Ito&#x27;s work has developed a substantial cult following, and Ito has been called an iconic horror manga artist. His manga has been adapted to both film and anime television series, including the &quot;Tomie&quot; film series and both the &quot;Junji Ito Collection&quot; and &quot;Junji Ito Maniac: Japanese Tales of the Macabre&quot; anime anthology series.

==Life and career==
Junji Ito was born on July 31, 1963, in Sakashita, now a part of Nakatsugawa, Gifu. He began his experience in the horror world at a very young age, with his first manga being &quot;Mummy Teacher&quot; by Kazuo Umezu; his two older sisters read Umezu and Shinichi Koga in magazines, and consequently, he began reading them too. He grew up in the countryside, in a small city next to Nagano. In the house where he lived, the bathroom was at the end of an underground tunnel, where there were spider crickets; such experiences were later reflected in his works.

Ito began to draw manga at the age of 4, taking inspiration from the works he read in magazines. He continued to draw as a hobby until he became a dental technician in 1984, where he struggled to find a balance between the two.

In 1987, he submitted a short story to &quot;Monthly Halloween&quot; that won an honorable mention in the Kazuo Umezu Prize (with Umezu himself as one of the judges). This story ran for 13 years and was later serialized as &quot;Tomie&quot;.

Ito drew the cover of Mucc&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Hōmura Uta&quot;. He collaborated with the band again in 2020, for the cover of their made-to-order single &quot;Shōfu 2020&quot;. Ito teamed up with Takashi Nagasaki and former diplomat Masaru Sato to create &quot;Yūkoku no Rasputin&quot; (2010–2012), based on Sato&#x27;s personal experiences in Russia, for &quot;Big Comic&quot;.

Film director Guillermo del Toro cited on his official Twitter account that Ito was originally a collaborator for the video game &quot;Silent Hills&quot;, of which both Del Toro and game designer Hideo Kojima were the main directors. However, a year after its announcement, the project was canceled by Konami, the IP&#x27;s owner. Ito and Del Toro would later lend their likenesses to Kojima&#x27;s next project, &quot;Death Stranding&quot;.

=== Awards ===
Ito&#x27;s work &quot;Uzumaki&quot; was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2003 and 2009.

In 2019, Ito received his first Eisner Award for his manga adaptation of Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot; for &quot;Best Adaptation from Another Medium.&quot;

In 2021, Ito received two more Eisner Awards for his works &quot;Remina&quot; and &quot;Venus in the Blind Spot&quot;, receiving &quot;&quot;&quot;Best U.S. Edition of International Material - Asia&quot; and &quot;Best Writer/Artist.&quot;

The following year, Ito received another Eisner Award for his work &quot;Lovesickness&quot;, receiving &quot;&quot;&quot;Best U.S. Edition of International Material - Asia&quot; for the third time and his fourth Eisner Award.&quot;

In 2023, Ito was awarded the Inkpot Award during the annual San Diego Comic-Con.

===Personal life===
In 2006, Ito married Ayako Ishiguro (石黒亜矢子), a picture book artist. As of 2024, they have two daughters.

==Inspiration and themes==

=== Other artists ===
In addition to Kazuo Umezu, and Shigeru Mizuki, Ito has cited Hideshi Hino, Shinichi Koga, Yasutaka Tsutsui, Edogawa Ranpo and H. P. Lovecraft as being major influences on his work. Ito has stated that Umezu has inspired his storytelling, and Hino has inspired his ability in creating a mood for a work. He has also stated that he admires Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s work.

A connection between Lovecraft&#x27;s work and the spirals of &quot;Uzumaki&quot; has been placed before, as well as a common theme of cosmic horror.

Ito has also cited H. R. Giger, Salvador Dalí, and others as influences on his work as well.

=== Childhood ===
Ito has been inspired by horror since childhood, with his first manga being written about a protagonist with an eye in the middle of his hand, attacking him; this was heavily influenced by Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s &quot;Kappa no Sanpei&quot;. Ito was inspired by the horror films of the 20th century (such as &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;), as well as period dramas of ghosts. He has also found inspiration from Rakugo storytellers who tell Kaiden ghost stories, incorporating it into &quot;No Longer Human&quot;.

&quot;Tomie&quot; was inspired by the death of one of his classmates. Ito felt strange that a boy he knew suddenly disappeared from the world, and he kept expecting the boy to show up again; from this came the idea of a girl who is supposed to have died but then just shows up as if nothing had happened. &quot;Gyo&quot; was influenced by the shark attack scenes from &quot;Jaws&quot;. &quot;The Hanging Balloons&quot; was based on a childhood dream. &quot;Long Dream&quot; was inspired by his sister mentioning research of dreams being instantaneous, and &quot;Slug Girl&quot; was inspired by Ito moving his tongue around in the mirror and finding that it resembled a slug.

=== Academics ===
Ito studied and graduated from a vocational school with a degree in Dental Technology before working as a dental technician, where he worked for 3 years until he became a full-time mangaka. Ito found anatomical interest in the books for the medical students, which he used to study muscles. He is also cited stating the schooling gave him more inspiration for his tools in drawing, namely pens and how to whittle pencils like dentures.

=== Themes ===
Ito&#x27;s work consists of many subgenres of horror, mainly being host to the subgenres of body horror and cosmic horror. Much of his work is based solely in them, with other themes including a relationship of predator to prey, a loss of humanity, apocalyptic scenarios, and obsession being common. The universe Ito depicts is cruel and capricious; his characters often find themselves victims of malevolent unnatural circumstances for no discernible reason or punished out of proportion for minor infractions against an unknown and incomprehensible natural order. He takes inspiration from his own fears as well, including death, war, insects, and being watched.

Ito has been cited saying that he draws the manifestation of the mind becoming reality, represented in body horror.

<text>John Simmons Barth (; May 27, 1930 – April 2, 2024) was an American writer best known for his postmodern and metafictional fiction. His most highly regarded and influential works were published in the 1960s, and include &quot;The Sot-Weed Factor&quot;, a whimsical retelling of Maryland&#x27;s colonial history; &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot;, a satirical fantasy in which a university is a microcosm of the Cold War world; and &quot;Lost in the Funhouse&quot;, a self-referential and experimental collection of short stories. He was co-recipient of the National Book Award in 1973 for his episodic novel &quot;Chimera&quot;.

==Life==
John Barth, called &quot;Jack&quot;, was born in Cambridge, Maryland, on May 27, 1930. He had an older brother, Bill, and a twin sister, Jill. In 1947, he graduated from Cambridge High School, where he played drums and wrote for the school newspaper. He briefly studied &quot;Elementary Theory and Advanced Orchestration&quot; at the Juilliard School before attending Johns Hopkins University, where he received a B.A. in 1951 and an M.A. in 1952. His thesis novel, &quot;The Shirt of Nessus&quot;, drew on his experiences at Johns Hopkins.

Barth married Harriet Anne Strickland on January 11, 1950. He published two short stories that same year, one in Johns Hopkins&#x27;s student literary magazine and one in &quot;The Hopkins Review&quot;. His daughter, Christine Ann, was born in the summer of 1951. His son, John Strickland, was born the following year.

From 1953 to 1965, Barth was a professor at Pennsylvania State University, where he met his second wife, Shelly Rosenberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.davidlouisedelman.com&quot;&gt;&quot;John Barth&quot; FAQ, http://www.davidlouisedelman.com/barth/faqs &lt;/ref&gt; His third child, Daniel Stephen, was born in 1954. In 1965, he moved to the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he taught from 1965 to 1973. In that period, he came to know &quot;the remarkable short fiction&quot; of the Argentine Jorge Luis Borges, which inspired his collection &quot;Lost in the Funhouse&quot;.

Barth taught at Boston University as a visiting professor in 1972, then at Johns Hopkins University from 1973 until he retired in 1991 with the emeritus rank.

Barth died under hospice care in Bonita Springs, Florida, on April 2, 2024, at the age of 93.

==Literary work==
Barth&#x27;s career began with &quot;The Floating Opera&quot; and &quot;The End of the Road&quot;, two short realist novels that deal with controversial topics: suicide and abortion, respectively.

&quot;The Sot-Weed Factor&quot; (1960; the title is an archaic phrase meaning &quot;the tobacco merchant&quot;) was initially intended as completing a trilogy of &quot;realist&quot; novels, but developed into a different project and is seen as marking Barth&#x27;s discovery of postmodernism. It reimagines the life of Ebenezer Cooke, a poet in colonial Maryland, and recounts a series of fantastic and often comic adventures, including an account of the story of Captain John Smith and Pocahontas.

Barth&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot; (1966), is a lengthy satirical fantasy serving as an allegory of the Cold War, set in a university divided into an authoritarian East Campus and a more open West Campus. George Giles, a boy raised as a goat, discovers his humanity and sets out on a quest to become a &quot;Grand Tutor&quot;, a messiah-like spiritual leader within the university. The novel was a surprise best-seller, and some consider it Barth&#x27;s best work.

The short story collection &quot;Lost in the Funhouse&quot; (1968) and the novella collection &quot;Chimera&quot; (1972) are even more metafictional than their two predecessors, foregrounding the writing process and presenting achievements such as a seven-deep nested quotation. &quot;Chimera&quot; shared the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction.

In his epistolary novel &quot;LETTERS&quot; (1979), Barth corresponds with characters from his other books. Later novels such as &quot;The Tidewater Tales&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor&quot; (1991) continue in the metafictional vein, using writers as protagonists who interact with their own and other stories in elaborate ways. His 1994 &quot;Once Upon a Time: A Floating Opera&quot; casts Barth himself as the protagonist who on a sailing trip encounters characters and situations from previous works.

==Styles, approaches and artistic criteria==
Barth&#x27;s work is characterized by a historical awareness of literary tradition and by the practice of rewriting typical of postmodernism. He said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what my view of history is, but insofar as it involves some allowance for repetition and recurrence, reorchestration, and reprise [...] I would always want it to be more in the form of a thing circling out and out and becoming more inclusive each time.&quot; In Barth&#x27;s postmodern sensibility, parody is a central device.

Around 1972, in an interview, Barth declared that &quot;The process [of making a novel] is the content, more or less.&quot;

==Essays==
While writing these books, Barth was also pondering and discussing the theoretical problems of fiction writing. In 1967, he wrote a highly influential and controversial essay considered a manifesto of postmodernism, &quot;The Literature of Exhaustion&quot; (first printed in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 1967). It depicts literary realism as a &quot;used-up&quot; tradition; Barth&#x27;s description of his own work, which many thought illustrated a core trait of postmodernism, is &quot;novels which imitate the form of a novel, by an author who imitates the role of author&quot;. The essay was widely considered a statement of &quot;the death of the novel&quot;, but Barth later insisted that he had merely been making clear that a particular stage in history was passing, and pointing to possible directions from there. In 1980, he wrote and published another essay, &quot;The Literature of Replenishment&quot;.

<doc id="296875" wikidata="Q308891" url="?curid=296875" title="Special wards of Tokyo">
<text>are a special form of municipalities in Japan under the 1947 Local Autonomy Law. They are city-level wards: primary subdivisions of a prefecture with municipal autonomy largely comparable to other forms of municipalities.

Although the autonomy law today allows for special wards to be established in other prefectures, to date they exist only in Tokyo, which consists of 23 special wards and 39 other, ordinary municipalities (cities, towns, and villages). The special wards of Tokyo occupy the land that was Tokyo City in its 1936 borders before it was abolished under the Tōjō Cabinet in 1943 to become directly ruled by the prefectural government, then renamed to &quot;Metropolitan&quot;. During the Occupation of Japan, municipal autonomy was restored to former Tokyo City by the establishment of special wards, each with directly elected mayor and assembly, as in any other city, town or village in Tokyo and the rest of the country.

In Japanese, they are collectively also known as , , or less formally the or just if the context makes obvious that this does not refer to the whole prefecture. Today, all wards refer to themselves as a &quot;city&quot; in English, but the Japanese designation of remains unchanged. They are a group of 23 municipalities; there is no associated single government body separate from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, which governs all 62 municipalities of Tokyo, not just the special wards.

== Analogues in other countries ==
Analogues exist in historic and contemporary Chinese and Korean administration: &quot;Special wards&quot; are city-independent wards, analogously, &quot;special cities/special cities&quot; &quot;(teukbyeol-si/tokubetsu-shi)&quot; are province-/prefecture-independent cities and were intended to be introduced under SCAP in Japan, too; but in Japan, implementation was stalled, and in 1956 special cities were replaced in the Local Autonomy Law with designated major cities which gain additional autonomy, but remain part of prefectures. In everyday English, Tokyo as a whole is also referred to as a city even though it contains 62 cities, towns, villages and special wards. The closest English equivalents for the special wards would be the London boroughs or New York City boroughs if Greater London and New York City had been abolished in the same way as Tokyo City, making the boroughs top-level divisions of England or New York state.

==Differences from other municipalities==
Although special wards are autonomous from the Tokyo metropolitan government, they also function as a single urban entity in respect to certain public services, including water supply, sewage disposal, and fire services. These services are handled by the Tokyo metropolitan government, whereas cities would normally provide these services themselves. This situation is similar between the Federal District and its 35 administrative regions in Brazil. To finance the joint public services it provides to the 23 wards, the metropolitan government levies some of the taxes that would normally be levied by city governments, and also makes transfer payments to wards that cannot finance their own local administration.

Waste disposal is handled by each ward under direction of the metropolitan government. For example, plastics were generally handled as non-burnable waste until the metropolitan government announced a plan to halt burying of plastic waste by 2010; as a result, about half of the special wards now treat plastics as burnable waste, while the other half mandate recycling of either all or some plastics.

Unlike other municipalities (including the municipalities of western Tokyo), special wards were initially not considered to be local public entities for purposes of the Constitution of Japan. This means that they had no constitutional right to pass their own legislation, or to hold direct elections for mayors and councilors. While these authorities were granted by statute during the US-led occupation and again in 1975, they could be unilaterally revoked by the National Diet; similar measures against other municipalities would require a constitutional amendment. The denial of elected mayors to the special wards was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in the 1963 decision &quot;Japan v. Kobayashi et al.&quot; (also known as Tokyo Ward Autonomy Case).

In 1998, the National Diet passed a revision of the Local Autonomy Law (effective in the year 2000) that implemented the conclusions of the &quot;Final Report on the Tokyo Ward System Reform&quot; increasing their fiscal autonomy and established the wards as basic local public entities.

==History==

The word &quot;special&quot; distinguishes them from the of other major Japanese cities. Before 1943, the wards of Tokyo City were no different from the wards of Osaka or Kyoto. These original wards numbered 15 in 1889. Large areas from five surrounding districts were merged into the city in 1932 and organized in 20 new wards, bringing the total to 35; the expanded city was also referred to as . By this merger, together with smaller ones in 1920 and 1936, Tokyo City came to expand to the current city area.

===1943–1947===
On March 15, 1943, as part of wartime totalitarian tightening of controls, Tokyo&#x27;s local autonomy (elected council and mayor) under the Imperial municipal code was eliminated by the Tōjō cabinet and the Tokyo city government and (Home ministry appointed) prefectural government merged into a single (appointed) prefectural government; the wards were placed under the direct control of the prefecture.

===1947–2000===
The 35 wards of the former city were integrated into 22 on March 15, 1947, just before the legal definition of special wards was given by the Local Autonomy Law, enforced on May 3 the same year. The 23rd ward, Nerima, was formed on August 1, 1947, when Itabashi was split again. The postwar reorganization under the US-led occupation authorities democratized the prefectural administrations but did not include the reinstitution of Tokyo City. Seiichirō Yasui, a former Home Ministry bureaucrat and appointed governor, won the first Tokyo gubernatorial election against Daikichirō Tagawa, a former Christian Socialist member of the Imperial Diet, former vice mayor of Tokyo city and advocate of Tokyo city&#x27;s local autonomy.

Since the 1970s, the special wards of Tokyo have exercised a considerably higher degree of autonomy than the administrative wards of cities (that unlike Tokyo City retained their elected mayors and assemblies) but still less than other municipalities in Tokyo or the rest of the country, making them less independent than cities, towns or villages, but more independent than city subdivisions. Today, each special ward has its own elected and .

===2000–present===
In 2000, the National Diet designated the special wards as , giving them a legal status similar to cities.

The wards vary greatly in area (from 10 to 60 km2) and population (from less than 40,000 to 830,000), and some are expanding as artificial islands are built. Setagaya has the most people, while neighboring Ōta has the largest area.

The total population census of the 23 special wards had fallen under 8 million as the postwar economic boom moved people out to suburbs, and then rose as Japan&#x27;s lengthy stagnation took its toll and property values drastically changed, making residential inner areas up to 10 times less costly than during peak values. Its population was 8,949,447 as of October 1, 2010, about two-thirds of the population of Tokyo and a quarter of the population of the Greater Tokyo Area. As of December 2012, the population passed 9 million; the 23 wards have a population density of .

The Mori Memorial Foundation put forth a proposal in 1999 to consolidate the 23 wards into six larger cities for efficiency purposes, and an agreement was reached between the metropolitan and special ward governments in 2006 to consider realignment of the wards, but there has been minimal further movement to change the current special ward system.

==In other prefectures==
Special wards do not currently exist outside Tokyo; however, several Osaka area politicians, led by Governor Tōru Hashimoto, are backing an Osaka Metropolis plan under which the city of Osaka would be replaced by special wards, consolidating many government functions at the prefectural level and devolving other functions to more localized governments. Under a new 2012 law, – sometimes informally called &quot;Osaka Metropolis plan law&quot;, but not specifically referring to Osaka – major cities and their surrounding municipalities in prefectures other than Tokyo may be replaced with special wards with similar functions if approved by the involved municipal and prefectural governments and ultimately the citizens of the dissolving municipalities in a referendum. Prerequisite is a population of at least 2 million in the dissolving municipalities; three cities (Yokohama, Nagoya and Osaka) meet this requirement on their own, seven other major city areas can set up special wards if a designated city is joined by neighboring municipalities. However, where special wards are set up cannot style themselves as the Local Autonomy Law only allows Tokyo with that status. In Osaka, a 2015 referendum to replace the city with five special wards was defeated narrowly.

==List of special wards==
==Notable districts==



Many important districts are located in Tokyo&#x27;s special wards:
; Akasaka: A district with a range of restaurants, clubs, and hotels; many pedestrian alleys give it a local neighborhood feel. It is next to Roppongi, Nagatachō, and Aoyama.
; Akihabara: A densely arranged shopping district popular for electronics, anime culture, amusement arcades, and otaku goods.
; Aoyama: A neighborhood of Tokyo adjacent to Omotesando with parks, trendy cafes, and international restaurants.
; Asakusa: A cultural center of Tokyo, famous for the Sensō-ji Buddhist temple, and several traditional shopping streets. For most of the twentieth century, Asakusa was the main entertainment district in Tokyo, with large theaters, cinemas, an amusement park and a red light district. The area was heavily damaged by US bombing raids during World War II, and has now been rivaled by newer districts in the west of the city as entertainment and commercial centers.
; Ginza and Yūrakuchō: Major shopping and entertainment district with historic department stores, upscale shops selling brand-name goods, and movie theaters. This area is part of the original city center in the wards of Chuo and Chiyoda (as opposed to the new centers in Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, and Shibuya).
; Harajuku: Known internationally for its role in Japanese street fashion.
; Ikebukuro: The busiest interchange in north central Tokyo, featuring Sunshine City and various shopping destinations.
; Jinbōchō: Often referred to as &quot;Book Town,&quot; Tokyo&#x27;s center of used-book stores and publishing houses, and a popular antique and curio shopping area.
; Kasumigaseki: Home to most of the executive offices of the national government, as well as the Tokyo Metropolitan Police.
; Marunouchi and Ōtemachi: As one of the main financial and business districts of Tokyo, Marunouchi includes the headquarters of many banks, trading companies, and other major corporations. The area is seeing a major redevelopment in the near future with plans for new buildings and skyscrapers for shopping and entertainment constructed on the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. This area is part of the original city center in the wards of Chuo and Chiyoda (as opposed to the new centers in Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, and Shibuya).
; Nagatachō: The political heart of Tokyo and the nation. It is the location of the National Diet (parliament), government ministries, and party headquarters.
; Odaiba: A large, reclaimed, waterfront area that has become one of Tokyo&#x27;s most popular shopping and entertainment districts. It resides on a man-made island.
; Omotesandō: Known for upscale shopping, fashion, and design.
; Roppongi: Home to the rich Roppongi Hills area, Mori Tower, an active night club scene, and a relatively large presence of Western tourists and expatriates.
; Ryōgoku: The heart of the sumo world. Home to the Ryōgoku Kokugikan and many sumo stables.
; Shibuya: A long-time center of shopping, fashion, nightlife, and youth culture. Shibuya is a famous and popular location for photographers and tourists.
; Shinagawa:In addition to the major hotels on the west side of Shinagawa Station, the former &quot;sleepy east side of the station&quot; has been redeveloped as a major center for business. Shinagawa station is in Minato-ku, not in Shinagawa-ku.
; Shinbashi: A traditional Shitamachi district. Revitalization of it being the gateway to Odaiba and the Shiodome Shiosite complex of high-rise buildings began in 2016, and was completed in 2018.
; Shinjuku: Location of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, and a major secondary center of Tokyo (&quot;fukutoshin&quot;), as opposed to the original center in Marunouchi and Ginza. The area is known for its concentration of skyscrapers and shopping areas. Major department stores, electronics stores and hotels are located here. On the east side of Shinjuku Station, Kabukichō is known for its many bars and nightclubs. Shinjuku Station moves an estimated three million passengers a day, which makes it the busiest rail station in the world.
; Ueno: Ueno is known for its parks, department stores, and large concentration of cultural institutions. Ueno Zoo and Ueno Park are located here. Ueno Station is a major transportation hub serving commuters to and from areas north and east of Tokyo. In the spring, the area is a popular locale to view cherry blossoms.

<text>Red Hat Network (abbreviated to RHN) is a family of systems-management services operated by Red Hat. RHN makes updates, patches, and bug fixes of packages included within Red Hat Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux available to subscribers. Other available features include the deployment of custom content to, and the provisioning, configuration, reporting, monitoring of client systems.

Users of these operating systems can then invoke the up2date or yum program to download and install updates from RHN. The updates portion of RHN is akin to other types of automatic system maintenance tools such as Microsoft Update for Microsoft Windows operating systems. The system requires a subscription to allow access to updates.

On June 18, 2008, Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst announced plans for the RHN Satellite software to be open-sourced following the Fedora/RHEL model.
Subsequently, project Spacewalk was launched.

== Architecture ==
In the basic subscription model the information about a managed host is stored on Red Hat&#x27;s servers, and updates get downloaded directly from those servers as well. For an organization that manages multiple machines this is inefficient bandwidth-wise. Red Hat offers a proxy server (Red Hat Network Proxy) that once installed at a site allows machines to securely download updates locally. Advanced lifecycle management; provisioning features, like bare metal PXE boot provisioning; and monitoring features (e.g. centralized CPU and disk usage) cannot be done over the Internet to the hosted RHN servers. These features require a RHN Satellite Server running locally. the RHN Proxy Server costs $2,500 annually, and the RHN Satellite Server costs $13,500 annually, which includes the license for the embedded Oracle Database.

<doc id="296879" wikidata="Q1141948" url="?curid=296879" title="Kazuo Umezu">
<text>was a Japanese manga artist, musician and actor. Starting his career in the 1950s, he is among the most famous artists of horror manga and has been vital for its development, considered the &quot;god of horror manga&quot;. In 1960s manga like &quot;Reptilia&quot;, he broke the industry&#x27;s conventions by combining the aesthetics of the commercial manga industry with gruesome visual imagery inspired by Japanese folktales, which created a boom of horror manga and influenced manga artists of following generations. He created successful manga series such as &quot;The Drifting Classroom&quot;, &quot;Makoto-chan&quot; and &quot;My Name Is Shingo&quot;, until he retired from drawing manga in the mid 1990s. He was a public figure in Japan, known for wearing red-and-white-striped shirts and doing his signature &quot;Gwash&quot; hand gesture.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life and career ===
Umezu was born on September 3, 1936, in Kōya, Wakayama Prefecture, but raised in the mountainous Gojō, Nara Prefecture. His mother motivated him to start drawing when he was seven years old. His father would tell him local legends about ghost and snake women before going to bed. He was inspired to start drawing manga by reading Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Shin Takarajima&quot; in fifth grade. He was part of a drawing circle with others called &quot;Kaiman Club&quot;.

In 1955, he published his first manga at the age of 18 with &quot;Mori no Kyōdai&quot; based on the fairytale Hansel and Gretel with the kashihon publisher Tomo Book. He would soon shift towards the gekiga movement and publish manga in the kashi-hon industry in Osaka of the time, which would allow him more freedom than serializing his manga in magazines. His specialty was to include paranormal elements in his stories. At the same time, he also started working on manga; he published in the magazine &quot;Shōjo Book&quot; and the kashi-hon anthology &quot;Niji&quot;.

=== Breakthrough in the 1960s and 1970s ===
After moving to Tokyo in 1963 due to the decline of the kashihon industry, he developed his specific style, which blended the aesthetics of manga with grotesque horror visuals and broke with conventions of manga at the time. Horror manga like &quot;Nekome no Shōjo&quot; and &quot;Reptilia&quot; became a hit in the commercial manga magazine &quot;Shōjo Friend&quot; in the mid 1960s.

In the late 1960s, he also started publishing in manga magazines and he switched publishing houses, from Kodansha to Shogakukan, when a new editor asked him to draw something other than horror manga. He became a well established author and was at times working at up to five serials at the same time. In 1974 he won the 20th Shogakukan Manga Award for his series &quot;The Drifting Classroom&quot; about a school including its schoolchildren and teachers being teleported into an alternate post-apocalyptic universe.

In 1975, Umezu started becoming a public figure also apart from creating manga. He recorded songs based on his horror manga and released them as the solo album &quot;Yami no Album&quot;.

His comedy manga &quot;Makoto-chan&quot;, which he published from 1976 to 1981 in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;, became a hit. The hand gesture &quot;Gwash&quot; from the manga became Umezu&#x27;s own trademark hand gesture as well in public.

=== Late career ===
In the 1980s and 1990s, he focused on science fiction manga depicting a near future like &quot;My Name Is Shingo&quot; and &quot;Fourteen&quot;.

In 1995, he had to retire from regular publishing due to tendinitis after finishing &quot;Fourteen&quot;. He then became even more of a public figure, appearing regularly on TV in a red and white striped shirt. He was also famous for the architecture of his candy-striped home in Kichijōji, inspired by his &quot;Makoto-chan&quot; series. In 2011, he released a second music album with his songs.

In 2018 he was awarded the Prize for Inheritance at the Angoulême International Comics Festival for the French translation of &quot;My Name Is Shingo&quot;. This was the second prize awarded to him throughout his career and Umezu had previously been unhappy about the amount of recognition he had gotten for his work. The award motivated him to start working again and he produced a series of 101 paintings based on &quot;My Name Is Shingo&quot;, which were exhibited for the first time in 2022 and were his first new work in 27 years.

=== Death ===
In July 2024, Umezu was hospitalized after collapsing at his home in Kichijōji, Tokyo. He was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer, but did not undergo surgery, remaining in hospice care from September. On November 5, 2024, Shogakukan announced that Umezu died on October 28. He was 88. A private funeral was held by his family and close friends. Umezu was planning a new work prior to his death.

== Style and themes ==

=== Folklore and monsters ===
His work is influenced by Japanese folklore. Manga artist and critic Sakumi Yoshino explains that his horror manga is related to religion in Japan, as monsters and demons are not considered completely evil, and Umezu wants readers to sometimes also feel compassion for the monsters in his works.

=== Intergenerational conflict ===
Many of his manga feature intergenerational conflict between children and adults. Umezu initially focused on this topic as he found that relationships between mothers and children in manga in the early 1960s were portrayed only as caring, never as scary. His manga &quot;Reptilia&quot; depicts an intense conflict between a schoolgirl and her sick mother, who turns out to be a snake woman when she visits her in hospital. Manga scholar Tsuchiya Dollase compares this character with the Jungian &quot;Terrible Mother&quot;. The children of the deserted school in &quot;The Drifting Classroom&quot; are immediately betrayed by their teachers and need to fight for their survival. In &quot;My Name Is Shingo&quot;, children are the only ones able to communicate with and have an emotional connection with an AI computer. Umezu explained that he himself finds the world of children more relatable, as children are much more open and adaptable to illogical thinking: &quot;I’m writing about myself in a way. I don’t want to become an adult and &#x27;grow up.&#x27;&quot;

== Reception and legacy ==
His works inspired a new generation of horror manga artists. Junji Ito, Toru Yamazaki and Minetarō Mochizuki cite him as one of their biggest influences and Kanako Inuki got her career start in a magazine compiled by him. Rumiko Takahashi briefly worked as an assistant for him, while he was working on &quot;Makoto-chan&quot;. His reputation gave him the nickname &quot;god of horror manga&quot; (ホラーまんがの神様) in Japanese media.

Umezu&#x27;s manga broke with the norms of the commercial manga industry at the time that he started publishing in major magazines in the mid 1960s and created a boom around horror manga in the late 1960s. Tsuchiya Dollase writes: &quot;The monstrous mothers must certainly have scared the audience; at the same time, however, the torture of the pretty but superficial heroines by these horrifying mothers must have given the same audience a certain pleasure.&quot;

Umezu regularly received complaint letters from parents in the beginning of his career due to his horror visuals and also editors of magazines would ask him to scale down the violence in his imagery. He remarks in an interview: &quot;I was protested but never boycotted. I considered such criticism to be a form of praise.&quot; He was critical of watering down horror elements: &quot;Old Japanese folk stories and fairy tales could be unflinchingly brutal. They come from a time when tragedy and carnage was an everyday part of life. Now we have people calling to water them down, which essentially whitewashes history. It’s insulting to the memory of those who suffered to bring us these stories.&quot;

Besides his impact on the development of horror manga, scholar Tomoko Yamada counts Umezu as one of the manga artists in the 1950s who contributed to the development of ballet manga with his series &quot;Haha Yobu Koe&quot; (1958) and &quot;Maboroshi Shōjo&quot; (1959).

In 2019, Umezu received the Commissioner for Cultural Affairs award from the Agency for Cultural Affairs. It is an award for &quot;individuals who have made distinguished accomplishment in artistic and cultural activities&quot;. It is rarely awarded to people in the manga industry.

<text>Windows Update is a Microsoft service for the Windows 9x and Windows NT families of the Microsoft Windows operating system, which automates downloading and installing Microsoft Windows software updates over the Internet. The service delivers software updates for Windows, as well as the various Microsoft antivirus products, including Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials. Since its inception, Microsoft has introduced two extensions of the service: Microsoft Update and Windows Update for Business. The former expands the core service to include other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Office and Microsoft Expression Studio. The latter is available to business editions of Windows 10 and permits postponing updates or receiving updates only after they have undergone rigorous testing.

As the service has evolved over the years, so has its client software. For a decade, the primary client component of the service was the Windows Update web app that could only be run on Internet Explorer. Starting with Windows Vista, the primary client component became Windows Update Agent, an integral component of the operating system.

The service provides several kinds of updates. &quot;Security updates&quot; or &quot;critical updates&quot; mitigate vulnerabilities and security exploits in Microsoft Windows. &quot;Cumulative updates&quot; are updates that bundle multiple updates, both new and previously released updates. Cumulative updates were introduced with Windows 10 and only some been backported to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Windows 11 24H2 also introduced checkpoint cumulative updates and updates with Hotpatch capability in the name, where some of the updates no longer require a reboot. 

Microsoft routinely releases updates on the second Tuesday of each month (known as the Patch Tuesday B updates) but can provide them whenever a new update is urgently required to prevent a newly discovered or prevalent exploit, so-called out-of-band updates. System administrators can configure Windows Update to install critical updates for Microsoft Windows automatically, so long as the computer has an Internet connection.

In Windows 10 and Windows 11, the use of Windows Update is mandatory; however, the software agreement states that users may stop receiving updates on their device by disconnecting their device from the Internet.

There also exist C and D updates, that users enroll in when they click the update button.

==Clients==
===Windows Update web app===

Windows Update was introduced as a web app with the launch of Windows 98 and offered additional desktop themes, games, device driver updates, and optional components such as NetMeeting. Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 were retroactively given the ability to access the Windows Update website and download updates designed for those operating systems, starting with the release of Internet Explorer 4. The initial focus of Windows Update was free add-ons and new technologies for Windows. Security fixes for Outlook Express, Internet Explorer and other programs appeared later, as did access to beta versions of upcoming Microsoft software, e.g. Internet Explorer 5. Fixes to Windows 98 to resolve the Year 2000 problem were distributed using Windows Update in December 1998. Microsoft attributed the sales success of Windows 98 in part to Windows Update.

The Windows Update web app requires either Internet Explorer or a third-party web browser that supports the ActiveX technology. The earliest version of the web app, version 3, does not send any personally identifiable information to Microsoft. Instead, the app downloads a full list of every available update and chooses which one to download and install. But the list grew so large that the performance impact of processing became a concern. Arie Slob, writing for the Windows-help.net newsletter in March 2003, noted that the size of the update list had exceeded , which caused delays of more than a minute for dial-up users. Windows Update v4, released in 2001 in conjunction with Windows XP, changed this. This version of the app makes an inventory of the system&#x27;s hardware and Microsoft software and sends them to the service, thus offloading the processing burden to Microsoft servers.

===Critical Update Notification Utility===

&quot;Critical Update Notification Utility&quot; (initially &quot;Critical Update Notification Tool&quot;) is a background process that checks the Windows Update website on a regular schedule for new updates that have been marked as &quot;Critical.&quot; It was released shortly after Windows 98.

By default, this check occurs every five minutes, plus when Internet Explorer starts; however, the user could configure the next check to occur only at certain times of the day or on certain days of the week. The tool queries the Microsoft server for a file called &quot;codice_1&quot;, which contained a list of all the critical updates released for the operating system. The tool then compares this list with the list of installed updates on its machine and displays an update availability notification. Once the check is executed, any custom schedule defined by the user is reverted to the default. Microsoft stated that this ensures that users receive notification of critical updates in a timely manner.

An analysis done by security researcher H. D. Moore in early 1999 was critical of this approach, describing it as &quot;horribly inefficient&quot; and susceptible to attacks. In a posting to BugTraq, he explained that, &quot;every single Windows 98 computer that wishes to get an update has to rely on a single host for the security. If that one server got compromised one day, or an attacker cracked the [Microsoft] DNS server again, there could be millions of users installing trojans every hour. The scope of this attack is big enough to attract crackers who actually know what they are doing...&quot;

Microsoft continued to promote the tool through 1999 and the first half of 2000. Initial releases of Windows 2000 shipped with the tool. The tool did not support Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.

===Automatic Updates===

&quot;Automatic Updates&quot; is the successor of the Critical Update Notification Utility. It was released in 2000, along with Windows Me. It supports Windows 2000 SP3 as well.

Unlike its predecessor, Automatic Updates can download and install updates. Instead of the five-minute schedule used by its predecessor, Automatic Updates checks the Windows Update servers once a day. After Windows Me is installed, a notification balloon prompts the user to configure the Automatic Updates client. The user can choose from three notification schemes: being notified before downloading the update, being notified before installing the update, or both. If new updates are ready to be installed, the user may install them before turning off the computer. A shield icon will be displayed on the Shutdown button during this time.

Windows XP and Windows 2000 SP3 include Background Intelligent Transfer Service, a Windows service for transferring files in the background without user interaction. As a system component, it is capable of monitoring the user&#x27;s Internet usage and throttling its own bandwidth usage in order to prioritize user-initiated activities. The Automatic Updates client for these operating systems was updated to use this system service.

Automatic Updates in Windows XP gained notoriety for repeatedly interrupting the user while working on their computer. Every time an update requiring a reboot was installed, Automatic Updates would prompt the user with a dialog box that allowed the user to restart immediately or dismiss the dialog box, which would reappear in ten minutes; a behavior that Jeff Atwood described as &quot;perhaps the naggiest dialog box ever.&quot;

In 2013, it was observed that shortly after the startup process, Automatic Updates (codice_2) and Service Host (codice_3 in Windows XP would claim 100% of a computer&#x27;s CPU capacity for extended periods of time (between ten minutes to two hours), making affected computers unusable. According to Woody Leonhart of InfoWorld, early reports of this issue could be seen in Microsoft TechNet forums in late May 2013, although Microsoft first received a large number of complaints about this issue in September 2013. The cause was an exponential algorithm in the evaluation of superseded updates, which had grown large over the decade following the release of Windows XP. Microsoft&#x27;s attempts to fix the issue in October, November and December proved futile, causing the issue to be escalated to the top priority.

===Windows Update Agent===

Starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, &quot;Windows Update Agent&quot; replaces both the Windows Update web app and the Automatic Updates client. It is in charge of downloading and installing software update from Windows Update, as well as the on-premises servers of Windows Server Updates Services or System Center Configuration Manager.

Windows Update Agent can be managed through a Control Panel applet, as well as Group Policy, Microsoft Intune and Windows PowerShell. It can also be set to automatically download and install both &quot;important&quot; and &quot;recommended&quot; updates. In prior versions of Windows, such updates were only available through the Windows Update website. Additionally, Windows Update in Windows Vista supports downloading Windows Ultimate Extras, optional software for Windows Vista Ultimate Edition.

Unlike Automatic Updates in Windows XP, Windows Update Agent in Windows Vista and Windows 7 allows the user to postpone the mandatory restart (required for the update process to complete) for up to four hours. The revised dialog box that prompts for the restart appears under other windows, instead of on top of them. However, standard user accounts only have 15 minutes to respond to this dialog box. This was changed with Windows 8: Users have 3 days (72 hours) before the computer reboots automatically after installing automatic updates that require a reboot. Windows 8 also consolidates the restart requests for non-critical updates into just one per month. Additionally, the login screen notifies them of the restart requirements.

Windows Update Agent makes use of the Transactional NTFS feature introduced with Windows Vista to apply updates to Windows system files. This feature helps Windows recover cleanly in the event of an unexpected failure, as file changes are committed atomically.

Since Windows 8, the Windows Update is able to offers device firmware updates, for example UEFI.

Windows 10 contains major changes to Windows Update Agent operations; it no longer allows the manual, selective installation of updates. All updates, regardless of type (this includes hardware drivers), are downloaded and installed automatically, and users are only given the option to choose whether their system would reboot automatically to install updates when the system is inactive or be notified to schedule a reboot. Microsoft offers a diagnostic tool that can be used to hide troublesome device drivers and prevent them from being reinstalled, but only after they had already been installed and then uninstalled without rebooting the system.

Windows Update Agent on Windows 10 supports peer-to-peer distribution of updates; by default, systems&#x27; bandwidth is used to distribute previously downloaded updates to other users, in combination with Microsoft servers. Users may optionally change Windows Update to only perform peer-to-peer updates within their local area network.

Windows 10 also introduced cumulative updates. For example, if Microsoft released updates KB00001 in July, KB00002 in August, and KB00003 in September, Microsoft would release cumulative update KB00004, which packs KB00001, KB00002, and KB00003 together. Installing KB00004 will also install KB00001, KB00002 and KB00003, mitigating the need for multiple restarts and reducing the number of downloads needed. KB00004 may also include other fixes with their own KB number that were not separately released. A disadvantage of cumulative updates is that downloading and installing updates that fix individual problems is no longer possible. KB stands for knowledge base, as in Microsoft Knowledge Base.

===Windows Update for Business===
&quot;Windows Update for Business&quot; is a term for a set of features in the Pro, Enterprise and Education editions of Windows 10, intended to ease the administration of Windows across organizations. It enables IT pros to:
* Switch between the standard and the deferred release branches of Windows 10. This feature has since been removed as Microsoft retired the deferred branch.
* Defer automatic installation of ordinary updates for 30 days. Starting with Windows 10 version 20H1, this feature is more difficult to access.
* Defer automatic installation of Windows upgrades (a.k.a. &quot;feature updates&quot;) for 365 days. Starting with Windows 10 version 20H1, these updates are no longer automatically offered.

These features were added in Windows 10 version 1511. They are intended for large organizations with many computers, so they can logically group their computers for gradual deployment. Microsoft recommends a small set of pilot computers to receive the updates almost immediately, while the set of most critical computersreceivese them after every other group has done s, and has experienced their effects.

Other Microsoft update management solutions, such as Windows Server Update Services or System Center Configuration Manager, do not override Windows Update for Business. Rather, they force Windows 10 into the &quot;dual scan mode&quot;. his can cause confusion for administrators who do not comprehend the full ramifications of the dual scan mode.

==Complementary software and services==
As organizations continued to use more computers, the per-machine Windows Update clients started to become unwieldy and insufficient. In response to the need of organizations for deploying updates to many machines, Microsoft introduced Software Update Services (SUS), which was later renamed Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). A component of the Windows Server family of operating systems, WSUS downloads updates for Microsoft products to a server computer on which it is running and redistributes them to the computers within the organization over a local area network (LAN). One of the benefits of this method is a reduction in the consumption of Internet bandwidth, equal to &quot;(N-1)×S&quot;, where N is the number of computers in the organization and S is the size made by the updates. Additionally, WSUS permits administrators to test updates on a small group of test computers before deploying them to all systems in order to ensure that business continuity is not disrupted because of the changes of the updates. For very large organizations, multiple WSUS servers can be chained together hierarchically. Only one server in this hierarchy downloads from the Internet.

Update packages distributed via the Windows Update service can be individually downloaded from Microsoft Update Catalog. These updates can be installed on computers without internet access (e.g. via USB flash drive) or slipstreamed with a Windows installation. In case of the former, Windows Update Agent (codice_4) can install these files. In case of the latter, Microsoft deployment utilities such as DISM, WADK and MDT can consume these packages.

Microsoft offers System Center Configuration Manager for very complex deployment and servicing scenarios. The product integrates with all of the aforesaid tools (WSUS, DISM, WADK, MDT) to automate the process.

=== Third-party services ===
A number of tools have been created by independent software vendors which provide the ability for Windows updates to be automatically downloaded for, or added to, an online or offline system. One common use for offline updates is to ensure a system is fully patched against security vulnerabilities before being connected to the Internet or another network. A second use is that downloads can be very large, but may be dependent on a slow or unreliable network connection, or the same updates may be needed for more than one machine. AutoPatcher, WSUS Offline Update, PortableUpdate, and Windows Updates Downloader are examples of such tools.

Third-party services exist for obtaining updates from Windows Update for older Windows versions. These include Legacy Update, which is a community-driven third party replacement for the Windows Update servers for unsupported versions of Windows from Windows 2000 onward. Windows Update Restored is another community-driven third-party replacement for Windows Update on older versions of Windows designed to replicate the functionality of older Windows Update versions, which also includes the old updates for all Windows 9x releases and Windows NT 4.0.

==Service==
At the beginning of 2005, Windows Update was being accessed by about 150 million people, with about 112 million of those using Automatic Updates. , Windows Update had about 500 million clients, processed about 350 million unique scans per day, and maintained an average of 1.5 million simultaneous connections to client machines. On Patch Tuesday, the day Microsoft typically releases new software updates, outbound traffic could exceed 500 gigabits per second. Approximately 90% of all clients used automatic updates to initiate software updates, with the remaining 10% using the Windows Update web site. The website is built using ASP.NET, and processes an average of 90,000 page requests per second.

Traditionally, the service provided each patch in its own proprietary archive file. Occasionally, Microsoft released service packs which bundled all updates released over the course of years for a certain product. Starting with Windows 10, however, all patches are delivered in cumulative packages. On 15 August 2016, Microsoft announced that effective October 2016, all future patches to Windows 7 and 8.1 would become cumulative as with Windows 10. The ability to download and install individual updates would be removed as existing updates are transitioned to this model. This has resulted in increasing download sizes of each monthly update. An analysis done by Computerworld determined that the download size for Windows 7 x64 has increased from 119. 4MB in October 2016 to 20 3MB in October 2017. Initially, Microsoft was very vague about specific changes within each cumulative update package. However, since early 2016, Microsoft has begun releasing more detailed information on the specific changes.

In 2011, the Windows Update service was decommissioned for Windows 98, 98 SE, Me and NT 4.0 and the old updates for those systems were removed from its servers. On August 3, 2020, the update service was decommissioned for Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003 and Vista due to Microsoft discontinuing SHA-1 updates. , the old updates for 2000 through Vista are still available on the Microsoft Update Catalog. On the same day ,SHA-1 updates were discontinued for older Windows versions prior to 7 and Server 2008. Updating Windows 7 and Server 2008 via the Windows Update service was also affected; however, Microsoft has provided SHA-2 patches that allowed Windows 7 and Server 2008 to continue receiving updates.

===Microsoft Update===

At the February 2005 RSA Conference, Microsoft announced the first beta of &quot;Microsoft Update&quot;, an optional replacement for Windows Update that provides security patches, service packs and other updates for both Windows and other Microsoft software. The initial release in June 2005 provided support for Microsoft Office 2003, Exchange 2003, and SQL Server 2000, running on Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003. Over time, the list has expanded to include other Microsoft products, such as Windows Live, Windows Defender, Visual Studio, runtimes and redistributables, Zune Software, Virtual PC and Virtual Server, CAPICOM, Microsoft Lync, Microsoft Expression Studio, and other server products. It also offers Silverlight and Windows Media Player as optional downloads if applicable to the operating system.

=== Command Line Updates Tools ===
There are only a handful of command line tools to install Windows updates. A very common tool that already works under Windows 7 and has no external dependencies is, for example, wuinstall.exe. It can push Windows updates to a computer (wuinstall.exe /install).

===Office Update===

&quot;Office Update&quot; is a free online service that allows users to detect and install updates for certain Microsoft Office products. The original update service supported Office 2000, Office XP, Office 2003 and Office 2007.

On 1 August 2009, Microsoft decommissioned the Office Update service, merging it with Microsoft Update. Microsoft Update supported all versions of Microsoft Office up to Office 2007 and later; however, it does not support Office 2000.

With the introduction of the Office 365 licensing program, however, Microsoft once again activated a separate Office update service.

<text>The Skåne Line (), popularly known as the Per Albin Line () after then-Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson, was a 500 kilometer long line of light fortifications erected during World War II around the coast of southern Sweden to protect the country from a possible German or Soviet invasion. It stretched from Halland across Skåne to Blekinge and consisted of two defensive lines:

*First defensive line: concrete bunkers along the shore, armed with machine guns and light cannons.
*Second defensive line: armed troops 300 meters inland behind barbed wire, some in concrete bunkers.

In the Helsingborg area the line was reinforced with a second line of rear-facing machine gun bunkers. As a further improvement there was also added a line of shelters to protect personnel from aerial bombing and artillery bombardment. There were two types of shelter designs (called SK24 and SK48), designed to provide protection for either 24 or 48 soldiers. This line stretches from Ystad to the north of Helsingborg, and consists of about 70 shelters.

At the end of the war in 1945 the defensive line consisted of 1,063 fortifications (shelters not included). The distances between each was 300–400 meters and most of them were located in direct proximity to the sea, built according to a number of standardised designs. During the Cold War the line was strengthened further, adding turrets armed with 75mm tank guns, either as additions to already existing fortifications or in newly constructed ones.

The decommissioning of the defences began in the late 1990s. Each landowner had to decide what would happen with the military fortifications on their property. Many bunkers were sealed, a small number were razed. The liquidation is still (2008) not fully implemented and several stretches along the south coast remain. The &quot;liquidation&quot; referred to here is not the physical removal of the reinforced concrete found everywhere along the coast of Scania, but the emptying of the bunkers and shelters of all military equipment. For instance, only a few of the bunkers have been demolished, to make way for housing. Today the forts are used primarily as artificial rocks for sunbathers in the summer.

In 2008 it was decided that 18 of the fortifications in the Helsingborg area would be preserved as historical landmarks. These bunkers are now managed by the Military Preparedness Museum (Beredskapsmuseet) and are undergoing extensive renovation. Starting in 2009, the bunkers were opened to the public. The refurbished bunkers were officially inaugurated on May 30, 2009 with battle demonstrations, the firing of salutes, fanfares and color guard processions.

<doc id="296889" wikidata="Q846910" url="?curid=296889" title="Philippine Airlines">
<text>Philippine Airlines (PAL) is the flag carrier of the Philippines. Headquartered at the PNB Financial Center in Pasay, the airline was founded in 1941 and is the oldest operating commercial airline in Asia.

The airline&#x27;s main flight operations are located at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Metro Manila. Its subsidiary PAL Express operates domestic routes, while PAL operates both domestic (Cebu, Davao, General Santos, Kalibo, Laoag, Manila, and Zamboanga, among others) and international routes mainly in the Asia Pacific region.

== History ==
The airline was founded on February 26, 1941, as Philippine Air Lines when its franchise to operate was transferred from Philippine Aerial Taxi Company (PATCO).

Formerly one of the largest airlines in Asia, PAL was severely affected by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In one of the Philippines&#x27; biggest corporate failures, PAL downsized its international operations by ending flights to Europe and the Middle East, cutting virtually all domestic flights except routes operated from Manila, reducing the size of its fleet, and laying off thousands of employees.

The airline was placed under receivership in 1998 but later restored operations to many destinations. After PAL&#x27;s exit from receivership in 2007, the airline has frequently revamped its management, seeking to re-establish itself as one of Asia&#x27;s premier carriers.

== Corporate affairs ==
Philippine Airlines is owned by PAL Holdings (), a holding company responsible for the airline&#x27;s operations. PAL Holdings is part of a group of companies owned by business tycoon Lucio Tan. ANA Holdings, the holding company of All Nippon Airways, has a less than one percent stake in PAL Holdings.

The airline is headquartered at the Lucio K. Tan Jr. Center, along Andrews Avenue in Pasay. In 2017, PAL was the ninth-largest corporation in the Philippines in terms of gross revenue, as ranked by &quot;BusinessWorld&quot;. As of December 31, 2023, PAL had 6,461 employees.

In 2007, PAL was the 61st largest airline in the world in terms of revenue passenger kilometers flown, with over sixteen million miles flown for 21 million available seat kilometers, an average load factor of 76 percent.

===Business highlights===

Note
*Data before 2014 were excluded from the table as figures before that year were compounded using a different fiscal year period.

== Destinations ==
In 1980, Philippine Airlines operated to destinations in Europe, such as Amsterdam, Athens, Frankfurt, London–Gatwick and Rome–Fiumicino. Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, PAL dropped some of its long-haul flights, with Cathay Pacific temporarily taking over PAL&#x27;s routes for fourteen days in 1998.

In 2010, the European Union (EU) banned Philippine carriers until 2013, despite the safety assessment by the International Civil Aviation Organization. After the EU lifted its ban, Philippine Airlines resumed its flights to Europe, including Amsterdam, London, Madrid, Paris, and Rome. On November 4, 2013, after a fifteen-year absence, PAL returned to London–Heathrow using a Boeing 777-300ER. On October 29, 2018, the airline launched a non-stop flight to New York–JFK using an Airbus A350-900; this was the ninth longest flight in the world. On April 29, 2021, Philippine Airlines announced its plans to fly to Israel by October, using its Airbus A350-900. The airline previously operated in Israel from the mid-1940s to the 1950s.

As of 2021, Philippine Airlines operates 43 international routes and 31 domestic routes. Its subsidiary, PAL Express, serves most domestic flights in the Philippines.

== Fleet ==


, Philippine Airlines mainline aircraft has a fleet size of 49 aircraft (excluding 27 PAL Express aircraft) with a mix of Airbus narrow-body and wide-body aircraft and Boeing wide-body aircraft.

== Branding ==
=== Logo ===
The Philippine Airlines logo changed four times since the company&#x27;s founding. Its first logo incorporated a blue oval with &quot;PAL&quot; superimposed in white letters, a four-pointed star with points intersecting behind the &quot;A&quot; in PAL, and a wing whose orientation varied depending on the location of the logo. The wing pointed to the right if located on the left side of the plane, and to the left if on the right side. A variant of this logo featured a globe instead of the blue oval with the superimposed PAL initials. It was used from the 1950s through the mid-1960s.

The second logo adopted a blue triangle with the bottom point missing and a red triangle superimposed upon it, enclosed by a circle. This was meant to evoke a vertically displayed national flag with white forming by the negative space between the two triangles. In the mid-1970s, a third logo was introduced that removed the circle and simplified the shape. The typeface used in the third logo was later applied to the second logo and remained the official PAL logo until 1986.

The current PAL logo features the same two blue and red sail triangles used in the second and third logos. An eight-rayed yellow sunburst was superimposed on top of the blue triangle, and a new Helvetica typeface was used.

=== Livery ===

PAL liveries have undergone many incarnations. The first PAL aircraft bore a simple white-top, silver-bottom livery separated by solid straight cheatlines, with a small Philippine flag superimposed on the tail. The name &quot;Philippine Air Lines&quot; was superimposed on the upper forward portion of the fuselage and the PAL logo was located at the back. Later variants of the livery, especially on PAL jet aircraft, made use of an extended Philippine flag as cheatlines, with the PAL logo superimposed on the tail. By this time, the name &quot;Philippine Airlines&quot; was used in the livery.

Another variant of the original livery used by PAL is somewhat similar to the current livery. However, it uses PAL&#x27;s third logo on the tail with blue, white, and red cheatlines running the center of the fuselage. Later on, the bottom half of the fuselage was also painted white

The current &quot;Eurowhite&quot; livery, first used with the Short 360, was adopted in 1986 following PAL&#x27;s corporate rebranding. This livery, (designed by Landor Associates) has &quot;Philippines&quot; superimposed on the forward portion of the fuselage in italics (using the PAL logo typeface), while the tail is painted with the logo and the Philippine flag is visible near the rear of the aircraft. The PAL logo is also painted on the winglets of aircraft that have them. The name &quot;Philippines&quot;, instead of &quot;Philippine Airlines&quot;, is to denote that PAL is the primary flag carrier of the Philippines. However, this sometimes leads to confusion that a PAL plane, especially when chartered by the President for official or state visits, is, in fact, the official air transport of the Philippine head of state. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number &quot;PR/PAL 001&quot; and the callsign &quot;PHILIPPINE ONE&quot; is a special plane operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the President or Vice President of the Philippines. The flight number &quot;PR/PAL 002&quot; and the callsign &quot;PHILIPPINE TWO&quot; are used if the Vice President travels simultaneously with the President. As such, the presidential seals are patched on or near the L1 and R1 doors of any PAL aircraft chartered by the president.

For the airline&#x27;s 70th anniversary in 2011, a special decal was placed on all of its aircraft. The sticker featured a stylized &quot;70&quot; and the words, &quot;Asia&#x27;s first, shining through&quot;. For its 75th anniversary in 2016, a special decal was put on the back of every aircraft. The sticker features a stylized &quot;75&quot;. PAL also placed a 4-star Skytrax sticker on its aircraft to celebrate its new rating.

In February 2019, Philippine Airlines rolled out its fifth Airbus A350 aircraft with a LoveBus decal that represents the 40th anniversary of its partnership with Airbus and to celebrate the airline&#x27;s signature heartfelt service. The kiss-marked LoveBus logo was also placed in 1979 on one of PAL&#x27;s Airbus A300 that represented their first year of partnership with Airbus. Its LoveBus A350 was rolled out from the paint shop and was accepted on February 14, 2019, Valentine&#x27;s Day. PAL took delivery of it three days later, and held a welcoming ceremony at Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2.

== Frequent-flyer program ==
Mabuhay Miles is Philippine Airlines&#x27; frequent-flyer program. It was established in 2002 after merging all of PAL&#x27;s existing frequent flyer programs before the Asian financial crisis. Mabuhay Miles are divided into multiple tiers: Classic, Elite, Premiere Elite, and Million Miler. Philippine National Bank (PNB) issues co-branded credit cards, debit cards, and prepaid cards that offer benefits such as free mileage points, travel insurance, priority check-in, access to a Mabuhay Lounge, and discounts when booking flights on the Philippine Airlines website. Prior to PNB, HSBC offers co-branded HSBC Philippine Airlines credit card.

=== Mabuhay Lounge ===

The Mabuhay Lounge is the airport lounge for Philippine Airlines. Business Class and Elite Members of Mabuhay Miles can use the lounge. These lounges have open bars, food catering, Wi-Fi, and charging ports for personal electronic devices. On June 27, 2018, Philippine Airlines unveiled a new Mabuhay Lounge for international business class, million millers, premier elite, and elite passengers at Terminal 2 of Mactan–Cebu International Airport.

As of September 2023, the Mabuhay Lounge can be found at the following airports: Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 (Intl.) and Terminal 2 (Domestic), Puerto Princesa International Airport, Bacolod–Silay Airport, Mactan–Cebu International Airport, Laguindingan Airport, Francisco Bangoy International Airport, Iloilo International Airport, and San Francisco International Airport.

== In-flight services ==
=== Cabin ===
Philippine Airlines currently offers three classes of service: Business, Premium Economy, and Economy depending on the aircraft. Its Airbus A330s and Airbus A350s offer three classes, while its other aircraft offer two classes. On September 15, 2022, the airline rebranded its premium economy service to Comfort Class for its domestic flights.

In 2017, PAL reconfigured the cabin layout of eight A330s, from a single class 414-seater into a 309-seater tri-class with Business, Premium Economy, and Economy sections. The reconfigured A330s were rolled out within seven months in 2017. The IFEs were Zodiac&#x27;s RAVE system. The seats were designed by Lift Strategic Design, and Lufthansa Technik Philippines performed the reconfiguration.

The previous aircraft acquired had no embedded in-flight entertainment (IFE), except for Boeing 777-300ERs. Instead, they offered rentable (Economy) or complementary (Business) iPad Minis with OnAir&#x27;s wireless IFE solution, OnAir Play. New aircraft have embedded IFE, due to the failure of PAL&#x27;s wireless IFE program for long-haul flights. They still offer wireless IFE on all aircraft.

=== Business class ===
Business Class is available on all aircraft. It offers increased legroom and lie-flat seats on the Airbus A330, Boeing 777, Airbus A350, select Airbus A321neo. Philippine Airlines is the only Philippine carrier to offer business class on domestic flights. On medium-haul and long-haul flights, Philippine Airlines provides amenity kits from L&#x27;Occitane en Provence.

Seats on the early Boeing 777s feature angled-flat seats manufactured by Recaro, while some of the latest aircraft feature lie-flat seats by Zodiac Aerospace (now Safran), arranged in a 2-3-2 configuration. Reconfigured Airbus A330s and the Airbus A350 feature lie-flat seats manufactured by Thompson Aero Seating, in a seating configuration of 1–2–1. A350 and A330 Business Class seats also feature Lantal air cushions, a four-way headrest, a storage shelf for personal belongings, a headphone hook, and a padded inner shell that absorbs noise.

Seats feature 15-inch (Boeing 777), 18.5-inch (Airbus A330 and Airbus A350), and 15.4-inch (Airbus A321neo) personal in-flight entertainment monitors with video on demand, as well as in-seat power. The seats feature a USB port where passengers can charge mobile devices. Passengers are also given noise-cancelling headphones. Select Airbus A321neos also feature lie-flat seats manufactured by Rockwell Collins (now Collins Aerospace), arranged in a 2-2 layout. They have a 60-inch seat pitch and a maximum seat width of 23 inches when fully flat. Business Class seats on Airbus A321ceos recline and have a seat pitch of . They feature a laptop power supply (both AC and USB). 

=== Premium economy ===
Premium Economy (known as Comfort Class for domestic flights since September 2022) is available on the Airbus A330 and Airbus A350, as well as PAL Express flights using two-class Airbus A320s. The seats are similar in design to standard economy class seats but feature at least four to five inches of additional legroom, providing a minimum legroom of 34 to 36 inches.

Reconfigured A330s, as well as A350s, have a different seat design with a layer of extra padding. It is 9.55&quot; wide, pitched at 38 inches with eight inches of recline. The seats also feature a 13.3-inch screen-flight entertainment unit with video on demand, a headphone jack, a USB port, and in-seat power. On aircraft without IFE, passengers are also treated to complimentary iPads.
=== Economy class ===
Economy class is available on all aircraft. Tray tables are found in the back of the seat in front, except for bulkhead and exit seats, where tray tables are embedded in the seats. They have four-way headrests. The seats offer a pitch that varies between 31 and 34 inches. Each seat offers video on demand and is equipped with 9-inch (Boeing 777) or 10-inch (Airbus A330, Airbus A321neo) monitors with a headphone jack and USB port for charging. They have four-way headrests and six inches of recline. An articulating seat bottom cushion comes with extra foam under the seat cover.

== Accidents and incidents ==
Although Philippine Airlines aircraft have been involved in a string of accidents since its founding in 1941, the majority of airline accidents have occurred with propeller aircraft during the airline&#x27;s early years of operations. Few PAL jet aircraft have been involved in accidents, the most notable being the explosion onboard Philippine Airlines Flight 434, masterminded by al-Qaeda through Project Bojinka.

=== Safety ===
In February 2007, PAL was the first airline in the Philippines to be accredited by the International Air Transport Association, passing the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA). Philippine Airlines has the highest safety rating of 7/7 according to AirlineRatings.com and was rated a safer airline than some of its Southeast Asian counterparts.

==Issues==
===Financial issues===
PAL experienced significant financial losses in the late 2000s. On March 31, 2006, PAL&#x27;s consolidated total assets amounted to ₱100,984,477, a 200% decrease from March 31, 2010. On March 31, 2013, the company&#x27;s consolidated assets continued to diminish by 8%, an amount equivalent to ₱92,837,849, compared to 2007 figures. The decline of PAL&#x27;s assets was primarily due to a net decrease in property and equipment and advance payments to aircraft and engine manufacturers. On March 31, 2001, other current and noncurrent assets fell by 29% to ₱2,960.4Mand by 20% to ₱2,941.7M &quot;due to the effect of re-measurement to the fair value of certain financial assets and derivative instruments&quot;. After carrying 17% more passengers in 2009 due to acquisition of additional aircraft and growth in the local market, PAL annual income report showed an increase in revenues of US$1.634 billion from US$1.504 billion in 2008. Despite this, PAL expenses escalated as a result of more flight operations and higher maintenance costs aggravated by fuel price fluctuations; forty-four percent (44%) of PAL income operating expenditures is utilized for fuel consumption.

===Labor issues===
PAL has a history of labor relations problems. On June 15, 1998, PAL retrenched 5,000 employees, including more than 1,400 flight attendants and stewards to reduce costs and alleviate the financial downturn in the airline industry. Represented by the Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), retrenched employee sought remedy through the judicial process, filing a complaint on the grounds of unfair labor practices and illegal retrenchment. It took a decade before the suit was finally settled. It passed the Labor Arbiter to the National Labor Relations Commission, then on to the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. The Philippine Highest Tribunal favored the aggrieved party and on July 22, 2008, in its 32-page decision ordered PAL to: Reinstate the cabin crew personnel who were covered by the retrenchment of and demotion scheme of June 15, 1998, made effective on July 15, 1998, without loss of seniority right and other privileges, and to pay them full back wages, inclusive of allowances and other monetary benefits computed from the time of their separation up to the time of actual reinstatement, provided that those who have received their respective separation pay, the number of payments shall be deducted from their back wages. The Supreme Court ruling explained that there was a failure on the part of PAL to substantiate its claims of actual and imminent substantial losses. Although the Asian financial downturn severely affected the airline, PAL&#x27;s defense of bankruptcy and rehabilitation was considered untenable; hence, the retrenchment policy was deemed unjustified. On March 26, 2018, the Supreme Court en banc voted in favor of Philippine Airlines, which affirms the 2006 Court of Appeals decision that says Philippine Airlines is not required to consult FASAP for its criteria for its retrenchment program.

===Competition===
For more than twenty years, PAL monopolized the air transport industry in the Philippines. This ended in 1995 through the passage of Executive Order No. 219 which permitted the entry of new airlines into the industry. The liberalization and deregulation of the Philippine airline industry brought competition into the domestic air transport industry resulting in lower airfares, improvements in the quality of services, and efficiency in the industry in general. At present, three airlines are competing in international and major domestic routes: PAL, Cebu Pacific, and PAL Express. Several airlines serve the minor and short-distance routes including Philippines AirAsia and Cebgo.

<text>Bonaventure Cemetery is a rural cemetery located on a scenic bluff of the Wilmington River, southeast of downtown Savannah, Georgia. The cemetery&#x27;s prominence grew when it was featured in the 1994 novel &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; by John Berendt, and in the subsequent movie, directed by Clint Eastwood, based on the book. It is the largest of the city&#x27;s municipal cemeteries, containing nearly .

The entrance to the cemetery is located at 330 Bonaventure Road. Immediately inside the gates is the large and ornate Gaston Tomb, built in memory of William Gaston, a prominent merchant.

==History==

The cemetery is located on the former site of Bonaventure Plantation, originally owned by Colonel John Mullryne. On March 10, 1846, Commodore Josiah Tattnall III sold the plantation and its private cemetery to Peter Wiltberger. The first burials took place in 1850, and three years later, Peter Wiltberger himself was entombed in a family vault.

Major William H. Wiltberger, the son of Peter, formed the Evergreen Cemetery Company on June 12, 1868. On July 7, 1907, the City of Savannah purchased the Evergreen Cemetery Company, making the cemetery public and changing the name to Bonaventure Cemetery.

In 1867, John Muir began his &quot;Thousand Mile Walk&quot; to Florida and the Gulf. In October, he sojourned for six days and nights in the cemetery, sleeping upon graves overnight, this being the safest and cheapest accommodation that he could find while he waited for money to be expressed from home. He found the cemetery breathtakingly beautiful and inspiring and wrote a lengthy chapter upon it, &quot;Camping in the Tombs&quot;:
Part of the grounds was cultivated and planted with live-oak (&quot;Quercus virginiana&quot;), about a hundred years ago, by a wealthy gentleman who had his country residence here But much the greater part is undisturbed. Even those spots which are disordered by art, Nature is ever at work to reclaim, and to make them look as if the foot of man had never known them. Only a small plot of ground is occupied with graves and the old mansion is in ruins.

The most conspicuous glory of Bonaventure is its noble avenue of live-oaks. They are the most magnificent planted trees I have ever seen, about fifty feet high and perhaps three or four feet in diameter, with broad spreading leafy heads. The main branches reach out horizontally until they come together over the driveway, embowering it throughout its entire length, while each branch is adorned like a garden with ferns, flowers, grasses, and dwarf palmettos.

But of all the plants of these curious tree-gardens the most striking and characteristic is the so-called Long Moss (&quot;Tillandsia usneoides&quot;). It drapes all the branches from top to bottom, hanging in long silvery-gray skeins, reaching a length of not less than eight or ten feet, and when slowly waving in the wind they produce a solemn funereal effect singularly impressive.

There are also thousands of smaller trees and clustered bushes, covered almost from sight in the glorious brightness of their own light. The place is half surrounded by the salt marshes and islands of the river, their reeds and sedges making a delightful fringe. Many bald eagles roost among the trees along the side of the marsh. Their screams are heard every morning, joined with the noise of crows and the songs of countless warblers, hidden deep in their dwellings of leafy bowers. Large flocks of butterflies, flies, all kinds of happy insects, seem to be in a perfect fever of joy and sportive gladness. The whole place seems like a center of life. The dead do not reign there alone.

Bonaventure to me is one of the most impressive assemblages of animal and plant creatures I ever met. I was fresh from the Western prairies, the garden-like openings of Wisconsin, the beech and maple and oak woods of Indiana and Kentucky, the dark mysterious Savannah cypress forests; but never since I was allowed to walk the woods have I found so impressive a company of trees as the tillandsia-draped oaks of Bonaventure.

I gazed awe-stricken as one new-arrived from another world. Bonaventure is called a graveyard, a town of the dead, but the few graves are powerless in such a depth of life. The rippling of living waters, the song of birds, the joyous confidence of flowers, the calm, undisturbable grandeur of the oaks, mark this place of graves as one of the Lord’s most favored abodes of life and light.


Greenwich Cemetery became an addition to Bonaventure in 1933.

==Operations==
Citizens of Savannah and others may purchase interment rights in Bonaventure.

The cemetery is open to the public daily from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. There is no admission fee.

Adjacent to Bonaventure Cemetery is the privately owned and newer Forest Lawn Cemetery and Columbarium.

==Department of Cemeteries==
The main office of the City of Savannah&#x27;s Department of Cemeteries is located on the Bonaventure Cemetery grounds in the Bonaventure Administrative Building at the entrance.

==Bonaventure Historical Society==
The cemetery became the subject of a non-profit group, the Bonaventure Historical Society, in May 1997. The group has compiled an index of the burials at the cemetery.

==&quot;Bird Girl&quot;==
The cover photograph for the best-selling book &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;, taken by Jack Leigh, featured an evocative sculpture of a young girl, the so-called &quot;Bird Girl&quot;, that had been in the cemetery, essentially unnoticed, for over 50 years. After the publication of the book, the sculpture was relocated from the cemetery in 1997 for display in Telfair Museums in Savannah. In late 2014, the statue was moved to a dedicated space in the Telfair Museums&#x27; Jepson Center for the Arts on West York Street, in Savannah.

<doc id="296891" wikidata="Q3182068" url="?curid=296891" title="Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil">
<text>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a non-fiction novel by John Berendt. The book, Berendt&#x27;s first, was published on January 10, 1994, and follows the story of Jim Williams, an antiques dealer on trial for the killing of Danny Hansford. Subtitled &quot;A Savannah Story&quot;, with an initial printing of 25,000 copies, the book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best-Seller for 216 weeks following its debut and remains one of the longest-standing &quot;New York Times&quot; Best-Sellers.

Berendt combined self-witnessed experiences during his time living in Savannah (roughly four years after the shooting) with stories from the preceding years recounted to him by locals; he catches up with proceedings around the book&#x27;s mid-point. Williams was a free man during Berendt&#x27;s five years in Savannah. The author took some liberties with his writing, including creating a relationship between Joe Odom and Nancy Hillis.

The character Serena Dawes was based on silent-film actress and heiress Helen Avis Drexel, while voodoo priestess Valerie Boles was the inspiration for Minerva.

The book was adapted for Clint Eastwood&#x27;s 1997 film, with several characters&#x27; names changed to protect their privacy. Maybe to &quot;protect the innocent,&quot; said Sonny Seiler, Williams&#x27;s attorney. &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t know how innocent they were, but he didn&#x27;t change any of the facts.&quot; John Lee Hancock wrote the screenplay.

The book&#x27;s title is shared by the title of chapter 18. Berendt dedicated the book to his parents.

==Background==
Berendt gave the finished manuscript to his agent, Lynn Nesbit, who enjoyed it but said it was &quot;too local&quot; and that no publisher would take a chance on it. She gave the manuscript back to Berendt, who found Suzanne Gluck, another agent. Within a week, she had four major publishers bidding for it. Random House were the successful bidders. It was published in January 1994, fourteen months after Berendt finished writing it. They did not change a word of the manuscript.

In tone, &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; is atmospherically Deep South coastal (Savannah, Georgia, and Beaufort, South Carolina) and Southern Gothic, depicting a wide range of eccentric personalities in and around Savannah.

The central narrative concerns the shooting of Danny Hansford, a local male prostitute, characterized as &quot;a good time not yet had by all&quot; by Prentiss Crowe, a Savannah socialite. The perpetrator was respected antiques dealer Jim Williams, who was also his employer and casual sexual partner. Hansford&#x27;s death resulted in four murder trials, with the final one ending in acquittal after the judge finally agreed to a change of venue to move the case away from the Savannah jury pool. The book describes Williams&#x27; version of the killing, which is that it was in &quot;self-defense&quot;—the result of Hansford, who was prone to fits of rage, shooting at Williams with a gun that was on display, and Williams shooting back to protect himself—and not murder, pre-meditated or otherwise, by Williams. The death occurred in Williams&#x27; Mercer House home, the ground floor of which is now a museum.

The book highlights many other notable Savannah residents, including The Lady Chablis, a local transgender woman, club performer, and entertainer. Chablis provides both a Greek chorus of sorts as well as a light-hearted contrast to the more serious action. Chablis was given a dedicated chapter, as was Emma Kelly, the &quot;Lady of 6,000 Songs.&quot;

==Characters and events==
The book&#x27;s plot is based on real-life events that occurred in the 1980s and is classified as non-fiction. Because it reads like a novel (and rearranges the sequence of true events in time), it is sometimes referred to as a &quot;non-fiction novel.&quot;

Although the book&#x27;s timeline is set to coincide with the entire saga of Jim Williams&#x27; arrest and four trials for murder, in reality Berendt did not meet Williams for the first time until March 1982 — six weeks after the millionaire had been convicted of murder and released pending appeal. Two years later, after Berendt had decided he wanted to write a book, Williams agreed to be interviewed by Berendt in jail. &quot;I might be interested in cooperating with you,&quot; he told Berendt. &quot;I really want my story out.&quot; Berendt flew down to Savannah. &quot;Jim actually saw very few people in jail. He didn&#x27;t like to be in such reduced circumstances. He always wanted to be on his own turf, where he could entertain people, and control people.&quot;

Berendt did not move to Savannah to collect material for his book until 1985 — after Williams&#x27; second conviction. Berendt attended the third and fourth trials. Williams was a free man and living in Mercer House during Berendt&#x27;s five years in Savannah. &quot;He was available to me and very cooperative,&quot; Berendt said in 2015.

&quot;When I started the book, I knew about the shooting,&quot; said Berendt. &quot;It did not happen in the middle of my being there. But I moved it to the middle of the book so that you could meet everybody in Savannah and get to know Savannah before this shocking event happened.&quot;

&quot;The only fictional character in the book is the narrator, me, until I catch up with myself midway through the book,&quot; Berendt said in 1995. &quot;I felt that was a legitimate license to take. The book is 99 percent true and 1 percent exaggeration.&quot;

In the first chapter, Berendt and Williams are interrupted by Hansford&#x27;s screaming entrance; this happened prior to Williams and Berendt&#x27;s first meeting in 1982. &quot;Jim was having drinks with somebody else,&quot; explains Berendt. &quot;Jim told me about it and so did somebody else. So I reconstructed it, put myself in there. The first evening in Mercer House is a combination of a lot of stories he told me. Then afterward, I meet all these people — Joe Odom, Chablis, Lee Adler. I met all these people, obviously, after the murder, but they don&#x27;t impact the murder at all, so I simply put them right after my meeting with Jim, and it &quot;seems&quot; as though I met them before the shooting and I didn&#x27;t, but so what? All of those meetings with people were actual meetings. They took place in &#x27;85 or later, and they are pretty much verbatim what happened with those people and me.&quot;

Jim Williams&#x27; confession to Berendt before the third trial was recorded on a Dictaphone by the author. &quot;If [Williams] had not died, I don&#x27;t know what I would have done, because I&#x27;m pretty sure he would not have wanted that in the book.&quot;

Lee Adler initially shunned Berendt after the book&#x27;s release, claiming he was misrepresented. &quot;At first he wouldn&#x27;t talk to me; now, he shakes my hand,&quot; said Berendt.

Nancy Hillis, who appears as Mandy Nichols, later explained that, contrary to Berendt&#x27;s portrayal of her, she did not meet Joe Odom until he had moved from 16 East Jones Street to 101 East Oglethorpe Avenue. She also clarified that there was no romantic relationship between her and Odom, largely because Odom was gay.

The person represented by Serena Dawes (based on Helen Avis Drexel) died in 1974, over twenty years before the book&#x27;s release.

Minerva is based on Valerie Boles, a root doctor from South Carolina.

Regarding the high number of eccentric characters in Savannah, Berendt&#x27;s belief is that it is because gossip was so important during his time in the city. &quot;People in Savannah gossip more than anywhere else,&quot; he said. &quot;What do people gossip about? Other people&#x27;s behavior. The stranger the behavior, the better the gossip. The person that is being gossiped about knows they are being appreciated and attempts to outdo themself on the strangeness.&quot;

In 2024, Berendt stated that he believed Williams was guilty of murder.

==Title==
The title alludes to the hoodoo notion of &quot;midnight,&quot; the period between the time for good magic (11:30pm to midnight) and the time for evil magic (midnight to 12:30am).

Although Bonaventure Cemetery is the focus in the book, &quot;the garden of good and evil&quot; refers principally to the cemetery off Congress Street in Beaufort, South Carolina, where Dr. Louis Buzzard, the husband of Minerva, the folk-magic practitioner who figures in the story, is buried. It is over his grave that Minerva performed the incantations to ensure a more successful result in the retrial for the case of Jim Williams. (The marriage between Minerva and Dr. Buzzard was the invention of John Berendt. Dr. Buzzard was based on Stephen Robinson, who died in 1947, aged 61 or 62.)

==Cover==
The &quot;Bird Girl&quot; statue, designed both as art and as a birdseed holder, was originally located in Bonaventure Cemetery. A Savannah photographer, Jack Leigh, was commissioned to take a photograph for the cover of the book. The cover image became immediately iconic, with author John Berendt calling it &quot;one of the strongest covers I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;, and the statue became a popular stop for tourists. Owing to rising concerns about the integrity of the statue and the cemetery&#x27;s privacy, &quot;Bird Girl&quot; was relocated in 1997 for display in Telfair Museums in Savannah.

==Legacy==
In 1993, the year before the book&#x27;s publication, Savannah had five million visitors, who spent almost $600 million during their time in the city. Two years after the book&#x27;s release, Savannah was seeing a 46% increase in tourism. Twenty years later, the number of visitors to the city had jumped to 12.5 million, spending $2.2 billion. Joseph Marinelli, president of the Savannah Convention and Visitors Bureau, does not attribute the city&#x27;s popularity growth entirely to &quot;Midnight&quot;, but that it had a significant impact.

Dorothy Kingery, Jim Williams&#x27;s sister, did not like the book. &quot;She kept everything hush-hush,&quot; explained Sonny Seiler, the Williams family attorney, &quot;but now she lets tourists go through Mercer–Williams House. But they cannot talk about the unpleasantness or what went on in that study on the first floor.&quot;

The story was turned into a musical in 2024 with lyrics and music by Jason Robert Brown and book by Taylor Mac.

==Awards==
The book won the 1995 Boeke Prize and was one of the finalists for the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction.

== Audiobook ==
Jeff Woodman recorded the audiobook version of &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;. He stated that Berendt&#x27;s effort, along with that of Ellen Raskin&#x27;s &quot;The Westing Game&quot;, was the most challenging to record: &quot;Especially because all the characters in &quot;Midnight&quot; have the same damned Savannah accent, so you can&#x27;t toss in a little North Country to help differentiate them!&quot; he said in 2010.

<text>Bird Girl is a sculpture made in 1936 by Sylvia Shaw Judson in Lake Forest, Illinois. It was sculpted at Ragdale, her family&#x27;s summer home, and achieved fame when it was featured on the cover of the 1994 non-fiction novel &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;. Originally exhibited as &quot;Girl with Bowls&quot; at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1938, it was also exhibited as &quot;Fountain Figure&quot;, &quot;Standing Figure&quot;, and &quot;Peasant Girl&quot;. A 1967 book by Judson first referred to it as &quot;Bird Girl&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Bird Girl&quot; is cast in bronze and stands tall. She is the image of a young girl wearing a simple dress with a &quot;contemplative, gracefully tilted gaze&quot; that &quot;stands solid and quietly, a strong and simple form ... a serene spirit that offers us in this troubled age the tranquility we find too seldom&quot;. The work was originally commissioned as a garden sculpture for a family in Massachusetts. A slight, eight-year-old model named Lorraine Greenman (now Lorraine Ganz) posed for the piece.
She stands straight with her head tilted toward her left shoulder, her elbows propped against her waist as she holds up two bowls out from her sides. &quot;Bird Girl&#x27;s pose does not actually symbolize the weighing of good and evil, rather, the bowls in her upturned hands were intended to hold food or water for birds. She was also originally designed to potentially function as a fountain, as indicated by the small holes in the bottom of her bowls and the slots at the front for water to overflow.&quot;

The inscription on the pedestal reads: &quot;We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. II Corinthians 5:8&quot;

==Original casts==

First sculpted in clay, the statue was cast six times, once in lead and five times in bronze, between 1937 and 1940 according to records from the Roman Bronze Works in New York City, but later correspondence from the sculptor mentioned only four casts. Four original bronze casts are currently known: one went to Massachusetts and is now in the Edward L. Ryerson Conservation Area in Riverwoods, IL; one went to a Washington, DC, garden and then to Reading, PA; another was bought by a Lake Forest, IL resident and is still there; and the fourth went to Savannah.

The most famous version was purchased by a Savannah family who named it &quot;Little Wendy&quot; and placed it in the family&#x27;s plot in Bonaventure Cemetery with an inscribed pedestal. It has since been relocated to the Telfair Academy, where it is on display for museum visitors. Judson donated the original plaster model to the Crow Island School in Winnetka, Illinois.

==Book cover==
The Bonaventure Cemetery statue sat virtually unnoticed until 1993, when Random House hired Savannah photographer Jack Leigh to shoot an image for the cover of John Berendt&#x27;s new book, &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;. At Berendt&#x27;s suggestion, Leigh searched the Bonaventure Cemetery for a suitable subject. He found the sculpture next to a grave on the Trosdal family plot, at the end of his second day of searching, and had to make the shot quickly as dusk approached. He reportedly spent ten hours in the darkroom adjusting the lighting, giving the photo a moonlit feel and accentuating the halo around the statue&#x27;s head.

The cover image, titled &quot;Midnight, Bonaventure Cemetery&quot;, was an immediate hit, and Berendt called it &quot;one of the strongest book covers I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. The book, published in 1994, became an all time bestseller, and soon people began flocking to Bonaventure Cemetery to see the sculpture. Due to concern about the amount of traffic at the grave site, the Trosdal family removed it from the cemetery and lent it to the Telfair Museums in Savannah in 1997 for public display. In December 2014, the statue was moved to the Telfair Academy where, as of 2025, she resides in a special exhibit.

==Additional casts==
In 1995, Judson&#x27;s daughter Alice Judson Hayes (aka Alice Ryerson Hayes) had an additional bronze statue created from a mold and gave it to the Ragdale Foundation, an artist residency program in Lake Forest. Later, an authorized fiberglass replica was made from the original plaster model for use by Macy&#x27;s in their display windows; it was later moved to Jack Leigh&#x27;s studio and then to the Savannah History Museum.

Hayes holds the copyright for the &quot;Bird Girl&quot; and has actively defended it by filing lawsuits against unauthorized reproductions, especially full-sized replicas. She destroyed the mold that was used to cast the 1995 replica, although the original plaster model still exists. Hayes has licensed smaller-scale replicas, which have sold well. She died on October 13, 2006, passing on the copyright to her daughter, painter Francie Shaw.

==Film use==
Warner Bros. produced a film adaptation of Berendt&#x27;s book in 1997, directed by Clint Eastwood and featuring Kevin Spacey and John Cusack. After purchasing the rights to use the sculpture&#x27;s likeness from Hayes, the studio created a fiberglass replica. The movie incorporated shots of the &quot;Bird Girl&quot; sculpture on its posters and in the film itself. After the film was completed, the replica was sent to the Cliff Dwellers Club in Chicago, Illinois.

Photographer Leigh sued Warner Bros. in November 1997 for copyright infringement over their shots of the &quot;Bird Girl&quot; replica in the cemetery, which were similar to Leigh&#x27;s original cover photograph. The lower court ruled that the Warner sequences with the statue were not infringement, but an appeals court found that the photographs used for promotional purposes, such as posters, bore significant similarities and remanded the matter back to the lower court. Warner and Leigh then settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

==Deaths==
Sylvia Shaw Judson died in 1978. Although she did not see her &quot;Bird Girl&quot; sculpture achieve fame, she was already a renowned sculptor whose pieces have been on display in such prestigious locations as the White House, the Massachusetts State House, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.

Jack Leigh died of colon cancer on May 19, 2004, and is buried in Bonaventure Cemetery, where he took his most famous photograph.

<doc id="296896" wikidata="Q314481" url="?curid=296896" title="Tokugawa Iemitsu">
<text>Tokugawa Iemitsu (徳川 家光, August 12, 1604 – June 8, 1651) was the third &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Tokugawa dynasty. He was the eldest son of Tokugawa Hidetada with Oeyo, and the grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Lady Kasuga was his wet nurse, who acted as his political adviser and was at the forefront of shogunate negotiations with the Imperial court. Iemitsu ruled from 1623 to 1651; during this period he crucified Christians, expelled all Europeans from Japan and closed the borders of the country, a foreign politics policy that continued for over 200 years after its institution.

==Early life (1604–1617)==
Tokugawa Iemitsu was born on 12 August 1604. He was the eldest son of Tokugawa Hidetada and grandson of the last great unifier of Japan, the first Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu. He was the first member of the Tokugawa family born after Tokugawa Ieyasu became &quot;shōgun&quot;. (There was some rumour said that he was not Hidetada&#x27;s son but Ieyasu&#x27;s son with Kasuga no Tsubone).

Not much is known of Iemitsu&#x27;s early life; his childhood name was Takechiyo (竹千代). He had two sisters, Senhime and Masako, and a brother, who would become a rival, Tadanaga. Tadanaga was his parents&#x27; favorite. However, Ieyasu made it clear that Iemitsu would be next in line as &quot;shōgun&quot; after Hidetada.

An obsolete spelling of his given name is &quot;Iyemitsu&quot;.

==Tokugawa heir (1617–1623)==
Iemitsu came of age in 1617 and dropped his childhood name in favor of Tokugawa Iemitsu. He also was installed officially as the heir to the Tokugawa shogunate. The only person to contest this position was his younger brother Tokugawa Tadanaga. A fierce rivalry began to develop between the brothers.

From an early age Iemitsu practiced the shūdō tradition. However, in 1620, he had a falling out with his homosexual lover, Sakabe Gozaemon, a childhood friend and retainer, aged twenty-one, and murdered him as they shared a bathtub.

He married Takatsukasa Takako, daughter of Takatsukasa Nobufusa at 12 December 1623. His relationship with Takako was good but Takako had three miscarriages.

==Shogunal regency (1623–1632)==
In 1623, when Iemitsu was nineteen, Hidetada abdicated the post of &quot;shōgun&quot; in his favor. Hidetada continued to rule as Ōgosho (retired &quot;shōgun&quot;), but Iemitsu nevertheless assumed a role as formal head of the bakufu bureaucracy. He declared in front of the various daimyo, &quot;Unlike my grandfather and father, it was decided from birth that I would become a &quot;shogun&quot;.&quot; This is said to be based on the advice of Date Masamune.

In 1626, &quot;shōgun&quot; Iemitsu and retired &quot;shōgun&quot; Hidetada visited Emperor Go-Mizunoo, Empress Masako (Hidetada&#x27;s daughter and Iemitsu&#x27;s sister), and Imperial Princess Meishō in Kyoto. &quot;Shōgun&quot; Iemitsu made lavish grants of gold and money to the court nobles and the court itself. Yet relations with Go-Mizunoo deteriorated after the , during which the Emperor was accused of having bestowed honorific purple garments to more than ten priests despite an edict which banned them for two years (probably in order to break the bond between the Emperor and religious circles). The shogunate intervened, making the bestowing of the garments invalid. When Lady Kasuga and Masako broke a taboo by visiting the imperial court as a commoner, Go-Mizunoo abdicated, embarrassed, and Meisho became empress. The &quot;shōgun&quot; was now the uncle of the sitting monarch.

In 1629, the government banned the practice of kabuki due to samurai fighting over female performers, leading to the practice of &quot;wakashu kabuki&quot;, in which young boys performed the roles instead. This attracted the attention of Iemitsu, who was known for his pederasty. In 1652, one year after Iemitsu&#x27;s death, &quot;wakashu kabuki&quot; was banned, also due to samurai fighting over the performers; Iemitsu&#x27;s enjoyment of it helped to postpone its ban until after his death.

In &quot;Kan&#x27;ei&quot; 9, on the 24th day of the 2nd month (1632), Ōgosho Hidetada died, and Iemitsu could assume real power. Worried that his brother Tokugawa Tadanaga might assassinate him, however, he ruled carefully until his brother&#x27;s death by seppuku in 1633.

==&quot;Shōgun&quot; (1632–1651)==
Hidetada left his advisors, all veteran &quot;daimyō&quot;, to act as regents for Iemitsu. In 1633, after his brother&#x27;s death, Iemitsu dismissed these men. In place of his father&#x27;s advisors, Iemitsu appointed his childhood friends. With their help Iemitsu created a strong, centralized administration. This made him unpopular with many &quot;daimyō&quot;, but Iemitsu simply removed his opponents.

In 1635, Iemitsu issued the second version of the &quot;buke shohatto&quot;, a collection of edicts dictating the powers and responsibilities of the &quot;daimyō&quot;. The original version had first been promulgated in 1615 under Hidedata. Iemitsu expanded the edicts to define the relationship between the &quot;han&quot;, the feudal domains of the &quot;daimyō&quot;, and the shogunate, increasing the number of edicts from thirteen to twenty-one. These new edicts further restricted the powers of the &quot;daimyō&quot;, preventing them from interfering with highways that entered their domains, constructing barriers, imposing embargos, or building ships larger than 500 koku. Furthermore, the edicts gave &quot;bakufu&quot; officials control over all criminal matters, leading to the establishment of the hyōjōsho, a tribunal which settled such matters, in the same year. Some edicts addressed separate matters, such as expressing support for filial piety, hostility towards Christianity, and establishing rules on who could wear certain clothes or ride in palanquins.

One major change instituted by the &quot;buke shohatto&quot; was the establishment of the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system, which forced &quot;daimyō&quot; to reside in Edo in alternating sequence, spending a certain amount of time in Edo, and a certain amount of time in their home provinces. The system at first originally applied to the &quot;tozama daimyō&quot;, but expanded to apply to all &quot;daimyō&quot; by 1642. One of the key goals of this policy was to prevent the &quot;daimyō&quot; from amassing too much wealth or power by separating them from their home provinces, and by forcing them to regularly devote a sizable sum to funding the immense travel expenses associated with the journey, along with a large entourage, to and from Edo. The system also involved the &quot;daimyōs&quot;″ wives and heirs remaining in Edo, disconnected from their lord and from their home province, serving essentially as hostages who might be harmed or killed if the &quot;daimyō&quot; were to plot rebellion against the shogunate.

=== Anti-Europeanization edicts ===

The century-long presence of Catholic traders and missionaries in Japan ended in the 1630s when Iemitsu ordered the expulsion of nearly every European from the country. European access to trade relations with Japan was restricted to one Dutch ship each year. Iemitsu&#x27;s policies on this matter were reinforced after the execution of two Portuguese men who came to plead for the re-establishment of Japan&#x27;s earlier foreign trade policy. By the end of the 1630s, Iemitsu had issued a series of edicts more extensively detailing a system of restrictions on the flow of people, goods, and information in and out of the country.

Over the course of the 1630s, Iemitsu issued a series of edicts restricting Japan&#x27;s dealings with the outside world. The most famous of those edicts was the so-called Sakoku Edict of 1635, which contained the main restrictions introduced by Iemitsu. With it, he forbade every Japanese ship and person to travel to another country, or to return to Japanese shores. The punishment for violation was death. Japanese, who had since the 1590s traveled extensively in East and Southeast Asia (and, in rare instances, much farther afield), were now forbidden from leaving the country or returning, under pain of death. 

The edict offered lavish gifts and awards for anyone who could provide information about priests and their followers who secretly practiced and spread their religion across the country. Furthermore, every newly arrived ship was required to be thoroughly examined for Catholic priests and followers. The document pays extremely close attention to every detail regarding incoming foreign ships. For example, merchants coming from abroad had to submit a list of the goods they were bringing with them before being granted permission to trade. Additional provisions specified details of the timing and logistics of trade. For example, one clause declares that the &quot;date of departure homeward for foreign ships shall not be later than the twentieth day of the ninth month&quot;. In addition to this, Iemitsu forbade alterations of the set price for raw silk and thus made sure that competition between trading cities was brought to a minimum.

In 1637, an armed revolt arose against Iemitsu&#x27;s anti-Christian policies in Shimabara, but there were other reasons involved, such as overly-high taxation and cruel treatment of peasants by the local lord. The period domestic unrest is known as the Shimabara Rebellion. Thousands were killed in the shogunate&#x27;s suppression of the revolt and countless more were executed afterwards. The fact that many of the rebels were Christians was used by the Bakufu as a convenient pretext for expelling the Portuguese and restricting the Dutch East India Company to Dejima in Nagasaki.

Following the edicts, Japan remained very much connected to international commerce, information, and cultural exchange, though only through four avenues. Nagasaki was the center of trade and other dealings with the Dutch East India Company, and with independent Chinese merchants. Satsuma Domain controlled relations with the Ryūkyū Kingdom (and through Ryūkyū, had access to Chinese goods and information, as well as products from further afield through alternative trade routes that passed through Ryūkyū), while Tsushima Domain handled diplomatic and trade relations with Joseon-dynasty Korea, and Matsumae Domain managed communications with the Ainu, the indigenous people of Hokkaido, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, as well as limited communication with related peoples on the mainland close to Sakhalin. Japan in this period has often been described as &quot;closed&quot;, or under &quot;sakoku&quot; (鎖国, &quot;chained country&quot;), but since the 1980s, if not earlier, scholars have argued for the use of terms such as &#x27;kaikin&quot; (海禁, &quot;maritime restrictions&quot;), emphasizing the fact that Japan was not &quot;closed&quot; to the outside world, but was in fact very actively engaged with the outside world, albeit through a limited set of avenues. However, the measures Iemitsu enacted were so powerful that it was not until the 1850s that Japanese ports opened to a wider range of trading partners, Westerners were free to settle and travel within Japan, and Japanese were once more free to travel overseas.

=== Relations with Imperial court ===
In 1643 Empress Meisho abdicated the throne. She was succeeded by her younger half-brother (Go-Mizunoo&#x27;s son by a consort) Emperor Go-Kōmyō, who disliked the shogunate for its violent and barbaric ways. He repeatedly made insulting comments about Iemitsu and his eldest son and heir, Tokugawa Ietsuna.

== Death ==
In 1651 &quot;shōgun&quot; Iemitsu died at the age of 47, being the first Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot; whose reign ended with death and not abdication. He was accorded a posthumous name of Taiyūin, also known as Daiyūin (大猷院) and buried in Taiyu-in Temple, Nikko. Iemitsu had expanded Nikkō Tōshō-gū prior to his death, but was careful to avoid iconography for his mausoleum that could be seen as surpassing that of his grandfather. He was succeeded by his eldest son and heir, Tokugawa Ietsuna.

==Honours==
*Senior First Rank (July 4, 1651; posthumous)

==Eras of Iemitsu&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==
The years in which Iemitsu was &quot;shōgun&quot; are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Genna&quot; (1615–1624)
* &quot;Kan&#x27;ei&quot; (1624–1644)
* &quot;Shōhō&quot; (1644–1648)
* &quot;Keian&quot; (1648–1652)

==In popular culture==
*Iemitsu&#x27;s rivalry with his brother Tokugawa Tadanaga over the Shogunate forms a part of the television series &quot;The Yagyu Conspiracy&quot; and is the basis for the film &quot;Shogun&#x27;s Samurai&quot;. At the end of the film, &quot;shōgun&quot; Iemitsu is killed and decapitated by Yagyū Jūbei in an act of revenge for his father Yagyū Munenori&#x27;s betrayal).
*In &quot;Basilisk&quot;, the retired Shogun Ieyasu had to decide which grandson will become the third Shogun: Takechiyo, as Iemitsu was called in his youth, or Kunichiyo, as Tadanaga was known in his youth. To determine this, he has two rival ninja clans, the Iga and the Kouga, fight a proxy war, with each side representing one grandson.
*Tokugawa Iemitsu appears as the ruling &quot;shōgun&quot; in the &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; episode &quot;Shogun&quot;, portrayed by Stephen Oyoung. He is to be married to Masako Yamashiro and takes the Atom&#x27;s (Brandon Routh) exosuit. Before the marriage can take place, the Legends take on him and his samurai, with Steel (Nick Zano) dealing the final blow, destroying the Atom suit and thus, stopping Iemitsu.

<text>Michael Alden Hedges (December 31, 1953 – December 2, 1997) was an American acoustic guitarist and songwriter. He was known as a virtuoso who used unorthodox playing techniques, and much of his output was classified as new age music. Hedges died in an auto accident, and won a posthumous Grammy Award for his album &quot;Oracle&quot;. 

==Early years==
The son of Thayne Alden Hedges and Ruth Evelyn Hedges Ipsen, Michael Hedges was born in Sacramento, California. His life in music began in Enid, Oklahoma, playing flute and guitar. He enrolled at Phillips University in Enid to study classical guitar and composition under E. J. Ulrich, who Hedges credited as his biggest influence from his academic training. Hedges studied as a composition major at Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland where he applied his classical background to steel-string acoustic guitar, also studying electronic music.

Hedges made a living by playing and singing in bars and restaurants in Baltimore while a student at Peabody. From 1976 to 1977 he played electric guitar and flute for a local group called Lotus Band, which he left to start performing as a solo acoustic act. In 1980, he made plans to move to California to study music at Stanford University. Hedges was contacted in February 1981 by William Ackerman who heard him perform at the Varsity Theater in Palo Alto. On a napkin, Ackerman signed Hedges to a recording contract with Windham Hill Records.

==Recordings==
Hedges&#x27; first two albums for Windham Hill were &quot;Breakfast in the Field&quot; and &quot;Aerial Boundaries&quot;. He wrote nearly exclusively in alternate tunings. His early recordings and most of the &quot;Breakfast in the Field&quot; album were recorded on the Ken DuBourg guitar and his Martin D-28, named &quot;Barbara&quot;. Some of the techniques he used include slap harmonics (created by slapping the strings over a harmonic node), use of right hand hammer-ons (particularly on bass notes), use of the left hand for melodic or rhythmic hammer-ons and pull offs, percussive, syncopated slapping on the guitar body, as well as unusual strumming. He made extensive use of string damping as employed in classical guitar, and was known to insist strongly on the precise duration of sounds and silences in his pieces. He played guitar variants like the harp guitar (an instrument with additional bass strings), and the TransTrem guitar. He was a multi-instrumentalist who played piano, percussion, tin whistle, harmonica, and flute. Virtuoso bassist Michael Manring contributed to nearly all of Hedges&#x27; records.

Frustrated that his published work reflected only the instrumental side of his creative output, Hedges convinced Windham Hill to release &quot;Watching My Life Go By&quot;, a 1985 studio recording of his vocal originals written over a span of five years—songs often performed at his concerts leading up to the album&#x27;s release. His fourth album, a live recording called &quot;Live on the Double Planet&quot;, was assembled from 40 of his live concerts from 1986 to 1987.

His musical education was largely in modern 20th-century composition. He listened to Martin Carthy, John Martyn, and the Beatles, but his approach to composition owed much to Igor Stravinsky, Edgard Varèse, Anton Webern, and Steve Reich, in addition to experimental composers such as Morton Feldman. He saw himself as a composer who played guitar, rather than a guitarist who composed music. He was often categorized as a new-age musician because of his association with Windham Hill.

Hedges toured briefly with Leo Kottke. These shows included solo performances by Kottke and Hedges and, as a finale, a number of duets including performances of Kottke&#x27;s &quot;Doodles&quot; with Hedges playing a high-strung parlor guitar.

Hedges&#x27; &quot;Aerial Boundaries&quot; album, released in 1984, included a tribute piece to the works of acoustic guitarist Pierre Bensusan, simply entitled &quot;Bensusan&quot;. Bensusan posthumously returned tribute on his 2001 release &quot;Intuite&quot; (&quot;Favored Nations&quot;), with a composition entitled &quot;So Long Michael&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hedges was married to flautist Mindy Rosenfeld but the couple divorced in the late 1980s. He was the father of two children, Mischa Aaron Hedges and Jasper Alden Hedges.

==Death==
According to his manager Hilleary Burgess, Hedges was driving home from San Francisco International Airport after a visit to a girlfriend in Long Island, New York. His car apparently skidded off a rain-slicked S-curve and down a cliff. Hedges was thrown from his car and appeared to have died nearly instantly. His body was found a few days afterward. After his death, his album &quot;Oracle&quot; won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best New Age Album.

Hedges&#x27; unfinished last recordings were completed for the album &quot;Torched&quot; with the help of Burgess and friends David Crosby and Graham Nash, who also provided backing vocals on one track.

==Guitars==
Hedges regularly used the following instruments:
* 1971 Martin D-28 guitar (nicknamed &quot;Barbara&quot;) with a combination of a Sunrise S-1 magnetic pickup and FRAP contact pickup under the treble strings
* A 1978 Ken DuBourg custom made steel string guitar (stolen and returned many years later)
* A custom 1980s Takamine guitar with his name on the headstock
* Lowden L-25 guitars
* Martin J-65M guitars
* 1920s Dyer harp guitar configured with a FRAP/autoharp pickup combo / reconfigured with Sunrise S-1 and two Barcus Berry magnetic pickups for the sub-basses (glued straight to the body)
* Steve Klein electric harp guitar with a Steinberger TransTrem bridge
* circa 1913 black Knutsen harp guitar (often incorrectly referred to as a Dyer) with a FRAP/autoharp pickup combo—and rattlesnake tail wedged under the sub-basses at the headstock
* Custom Ervin Somogyi acoustic (as credited on &quot;Breakfast in the Field&quot;)

<text>Andrew Thomas McCarthy (born November 29, 1962) is an American actor, travel writer, and television director. He is most known as a member of the Brat Pack, with roles in 1980s films such as &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot;, &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, &quot;Mannequin&quot;, and &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot;. He is ranked No. 40 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Teen Stars of all-time list. As a director, he is known for his work on &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot;.

==Early life and education==
McCarthy was born in Westfield, New Jersey, the third of four boys. His mother worked for a newspaper, and his father was involved in investments and stocks. McCarthy moved to Bernardsville, New Jersey, as a teenager and attended Bernards High School and the Pingry School, a preparatory academy. At Pingry, he played the Artful Dodger in &quot;Oliver!&quot;, his first acting role. After graduating from high school, he enrolled at NYU for acting, but was expelled after two years.

==Career==
McCarthy&#x27;s first major role was in the 1983 comedy &quot;Class&quot; opposite Jacqueline Bisset. He was a member of the 1980s Hollywood group of young actors dubbed by the media as the &quot;Brat Pack&quot;. The group starred in a few films, among them &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; and &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;. McCarthy appeared in the 1987 films &quot;Mannequin&quot; and &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, a cinematic adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis&#x27;s novel. In 1985, McCarthy starred with Donald Sutherland and Kevin Dillon in &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot; (also known as &quot;Catholic Boys&quot;) as Michael Dunn. McCarthy made his Broadway debut in &quot;The Boys of Winter.&quot; He quickly returned to Hollywood in 1988 to star in several films, such as &quot;Fresh Horses&quot; and &quot;Kansas&quot;. He had another hit with the 1989 comedy film &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot;.

He returned to Broadway to star in &quot;Side Man&quot;, and the production won the 1999 Tony Award for Best Play. In 2003, McCarthy was set to guest star in two episodes of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. Due to bad relations with actor Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, series creator Dick Wolf decided against it. Wolf later stated, &quot;Mr. McCarthy engaged in fractious behavior from the moment he walked on the set.&quot; McCarthy fired back in a statement of his own saying, &quot;I was fired because I refused to allow a fellow actor to threaten me with physical violence, bully me and try to direct me.&quot; Despite this incident, he later guest starred in a 2007 episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (with Chris Noth, not D&#x27;Onofrio). In 2004, he played Dr. Hook in &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot;. He appeared in five episodes of the 2005 NBC television series &quot;E-Ring&quot;. In 2008, he starred in the NBC television series &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot; as billionaire Joe Bennett and had a minor role in &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot;.

McCarthy directed several episodes of the hit CW television series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, including &quot;Touch of Eva&quot; in the fourth season. 
In 2010 and 2011, he appeared in the hit USA show &quot;White Collar&quot;. He returned to the series in the next season to direct the episode &quot;Neighborhood Watch&quot;. In 2015, he directed three episodes in Season 2 of the NBC hit television show &quot;The Blacklist&quot; starring James Spader and Megan Boone. In 2016, he starred in the short-lived ABC drama &quot;The Family&quot;.
From 2020 to 2021, he had a recurring role in NBC&#x27;s TV series &quot;Good Girls&quot;. In 2022, McCarthy joined the cast of &quot;The Resident&quot; as Ian Sullivan, a renowned pediatric surgeon and Cade&#x27;s estranged father.

==Writing==
McCarthy began travel writing and served as an Editor at Large at &quot;National Geographic Traveler&quot; magazine. In 2010, McCarthy was escorted out of an underground church in Lalibela, Ethiopia, for entering the site without documentation. He had been in the church on assignment for the travel magazine &quot;Afar&quot;. McCarthy&#x27;s book &quot;The Longest Way Home: One Man&#x27;s Quest for the Courage to Settle Down&quot; was published in 2012.

In February 2015, &quot;National Geographic&quot; published McCarthy&#x27;s account, titled &quot;A Song for Ireland&quot;, of his return to the house in the townland of Lacka West in the parish of Duagh in County Kerry in Ireland from which his great-grandfather John McCarthy had emigrated in the late 1800s.

McCarthy has received several awards from SATW (Society of American Travel Writers), including Travel Journalist of the Year in 2010.

In 2017, Algonquin Books published McCarthy&#x27;s YA novel, &quot;Just Fly Away&quot;. The novel became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller.

McCarthy&#x27;s memoir about his life and career in the 1980s, titled &quot;Brat: An &#x27;80s Story&quot;, was released in May 2021 by Grand Central Publishing.

In 2023, Grand Central Publishing released &quot;Walking with Sam: A Father, a Son, and Five Hundred Miles Across Spain&quot;, McCarthy&#x27;s memoir about walking the Camino de Santiago with his son Sam in the summer of 2021.

==Personal life==
In 1992, McCarthy entered a detoxification program and has been sober since that time. In 2004, he announced that he once had a serious alcohol problem, which began at age 12.

On October 9, 1999, McCarthy married his college sweetheart Carol Schneider almost 20 years after they first dated. He later stated his reasons for tracking her down after they had drifted apart: &quot;I ran into someone who said they had seen Carol and her boyfriend and they seemed really happy, and for some reason it bothered me for a week. I called her and asked her if she was really with this guy and asked her out for coffee.&quot; In 2002, Schneider gave birth to a son, Sam, who also became an actor. McCarthy and Schneider divorced in 2005.

On August 28, 2011, McCarthy married Irish writer and director Dolores Rice. They have two children, Willow and Rowan.

<doc id="296902" wikidata="Q151868" url="?curid=296902" title="Chinese postal romanization">
<text>Postal romanization was a system of transliterating place names in China developed by postal authorities in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For many cities, the corresponding postal romanization was the most common English-language form of the city&#x27;s name from the 1890s until the 1980s, when postal romanization was replaced by pinyin, but the system remained in place on Taiwan until 2002.

In 1892, Herbert Giles created a romanization system called the Nanking syllabary. The Imperial Maritime Customs Post Office would cancel postage with a stamp that gave the city of origin in Latin letters, often romanized using Giles&#x27;s system. In 1896, the Customs Post was combined with other postal services and renamed the Chinese Imperial Post. As a national agency, the Imperial Post was an authority on Chinese place names.

When the Wade–Giles system became widespread, some argued that the post office should adopt it. This idea was rejected at a conference held in 1906 in Shanghai. Instead, the conference formally adopted Nanking syllabary. This decision allowed the post office to continue to use various romanizations that it had already selected. Wade–Giles romanization is based on the Beijing dialect, a pronunciation standard since the 1850s. The use of Nanking syllabary did not suggest that the post office considered Nanjing pronunciation to be standard. Rather, it was an attempt to accommodate a variety of Mandarin pronunciations with a single romanization system.

== Comparison table ==
The spelling &quot;Amoy&quot; is based on pronunciation of Xiamen in the neighboring Zhangzhou dialect of Hokkien , which historically contributed to the formation of the local Amoy dialect of Hokkien in Xiamen. &quot;Peking&quot; is carried over from the d&#x27;Anville map which also came from older texts, such as Italian Jesuit Martino Martini&#x27;s &#x27; (1654) and &#x27; (1655). In Nanking syllabary, the city is &quot;Pehking&quot;. The irregular &quot;oo&quot; in &quot;Soochow&quot; is to distinguish this city from Xuzhou in northern Jiangsu. The other postal romanizations are based on &quot;Southern Mandarin&quot;, the historical court dialect based on the Nanjing dialect, which used to be the imperial lingua franca of the late Ming and early Qing court. Pinyin spellings are based on Standard Chinese, a form based on the Beijing dialect that is taught in the Chinese education system.

After the Kuomintang (KMT) party came to power in 1927, the capital was moved from Peking (&#x27;northern capital&#x27;) to Nanking (&#x27;southern capital&#x27;). Peking was renamed to &quot;Peiping&quot; (&#x27;northern peace&#x27;).

==History==

The Customs Post, China&#x27;s first government-run post office, opened to the public and began issuing postage stamps in 1878. This office was part of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service, led by Irishman Robert Hart. By 1882, the Customs Post had offices in twelve Treaty Ports: Shanghai, Amoy, Chefoo, Chinkiang, Chungking, Foochow, Hankow, Ichang, Kewkiang, Nanking, Weihaiwei, and Wuhu. Local offices had postmarking equipment so mail was marked with a romanized form of the city&#x27;s name. In addition, there were companies that provided local postal service in each of these cities.

&quot;A Chinese-English Dictionary&quot; by Herbert Giles, published in 1892, popularized the Wade–Giles method of transliteration. This system had been created by Thomas Francis Wade in 1867. It is based on pronunciation in Beijing. Giles&#x27;s dictionary also gives pronunciation in the dialects of various other cities, allowing the reader to create locally based transliteration. From January 1893 to September 1896, local postal services issued postage stamps that featured the romanized name of the city they served using local pronunciation.

An imperial edict issued in 1896 designated the Customs Post a national postal service and renamed it the Chinese Imperial Post. The local post offices in the Treaty Ports were incorporated into the new service. The Customs Post was smaller than other postal services in China, such as the British. As the Imperial Post, it grew rapidly and soon became the dominant player in the market.

In 1899, Hart, as inspector general of posts, asked postmasters to submit romanizations for their districts. Although Hart asked for transliterations &quot;according to the local pronunciation&quot;, most postmasters were reluctant to play lexicographer and simply looked up the relevant characters in a dictionary. The spellings that they submitted generally followed the Wade–Giles system, which was the standard method of transliteration at this time.

The post office published a draft romanization map in 1903. Disappointed with the Wade-based map, Hart issued another directive in 1905. This one told postmasters to submit romanizations &quot;not as directed by Wade, but according to accepted or usual local spellings.&quot; Local missionaries could be consulted, Hart suggested. However, Wade&#x27;s system did reflect pronunciation in Mandarin-speaking areas.

Théophile Piry, a long-time customs manager, was appointed postal secretary in 1901. Appointing a French national to the top position fulfilled an 1898 commitment by China to &quot;take into account the recommendations of the French government&quot; when selecting staff for the post office. Until 1911, the post office remained part of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, which meant that Hart was Piry&#x27;s boss.

===1906 conference===
To resolve the romanization issue, Piry organized an Imperial Postal Joint-Session Conference in Shanghai in the spring of 1906. This was a joint postal and telegraphic conference. The conference resolved that existing spellings would be retained for names already transliterated. Accents, apostrophes, and hyphens would be dropped to facilitate telegraphic transmission. The requirement for addresses to be given in Chinese characters was dropped. For new transliterations, local pronunciation would be followed in Guangdong as well as in parts of Guangxi and Fujian. In other areas, a system called Nanking syllabary would be used.

Nanking syllabary is one of several transliteration systems presented by Giles to represent various local dialects. Nanjing had once been the capital and its dialect was, like that of Beijing, a pronunciation standard. But the decision to use Nanking syllabary was not intended to suggest that the post office recognized any specific dialect as standard. The Lower Yangtze Mandarin dialect spoken in Nanjing makes more phonetic distinctions than other dialects. A romanization system geared to this dialect can be used to reflect pronunciation in a wider variety of dialects.

Southern Mandarin is widely spoken in both Jiangsu and Anhui. In Giles&#x27; idealization, the speaker consistently makes various phonetic distinctions not made in Beijing dialect (or in the dialect of any other specific city). Giles created the system to encompass a range of dialects. For the French-led post office, an additional advantage of the system was that it allowed &quot;the romanization of non-English speaking people to be met as far as possible,&quot; as Piry put it. That is to say, Piry considered the Wade–Giles system to be specific to English.

Atlases explaining postal romanization were issued in 1907, 1919, 1933, and 1936. The ambiguous result of the 1906 conference led critics to complain that postal romanization was idiosyncratic. According to modern scholar Lane J. Harris:

What they have criticized is actually the very strength of postal romanization. That is, postal romanization accommodated local dialects and regional pronunciations by recognizing local identity and language as vital to a true representation of the varieties of Chinese orthoepy as evinced by the Post Office&#x27;s repeated desire to transcribe according to &quot;local pronunciation&quot; or &quot;provincial sound-equivalents&quot;.
===Later developments===
At the Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation in 1913, the idea of a national language with a standardized trans-regional phonology was approved. A period of turmoil followed as President Yuan Shikai reversed course and attempted to restore the teaching of Literary Chinese. Yuan died in 1916 and the Ministry of Education published a pronunciation standard now known as Old National Pronunciation for Guoyu in 1918. The post office reverted to Wade&#x27;s system in 1920 and 1921. It was the era of the May Fourth Movement, when language reform was the rage. The post office adopted a dictionary by William Edward Soothill as a reference. The Soothill-Wade system was used for newly created offices. Existing post offices retained their romanizations.

Critics described the Ministry&#x27;s standard, now called Old National Pronunciation, as a mishmash of dialects, bookish, and reminiscent of previous dynasties. While drawing phonetic features from Beijing dialect, many phonological features of Southern Mandarin had been retained. In December 1921, Henri Picard-Destelan, co-director of the Post Office, quietly ordered a return to Nanking syllabary &quot;until such time as uniformity is possible.&quot; Although the Soothill-Wade period was brief, it was a time when 13,000 offices were created, a rapid and unprecedented expansion. At the time the policy was reversed, one third of all postal establishments used Soothill-Wade spelling. The Ministry published a revised pronunciation standard based strictly on Jilu Mandarin in 1932.

In 1943, the Japanese ousted A. M. Chapelain, the last French head of the Chinese post. The post office had been under French administration almost continuously since Piry&#x27;s appointment as postal secretary in 1901.

In 1958, Communist China announced that it was adopting the pinyin romanization system. Implementing the new system was a gradual process. The government did not get around to abolishing postal romanization until 1964. Even then, the post office did not adopt pinyin, but merely withdrew Latin characters from official use, such as in postal cancellation markings.

Mapmakers of the time followed various approaches. Private atlas makers generally used postal romanization before ultimately shifting to Wade–Giles. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency used a mix of postal romanization and Wade–Giles. The U.S. Army Map Service used Wade–Giles exclusively.

The U.S. government and the American press adopted pinyin in 1979. The International Organization for Standardization followed suit in 1982.

Postal romanization remained official in Taiwan until 2002, when Tongyong Pinyin was adopted. In 2009, Hanyu Pinyin replaced Tongyong Pinyin as the official romanization (see Chinese language romanization in Taiwan). While street names in Taipei have been romanized via Hanyu Pinyin, municipalities throughout Taiwan, such as Kaohsiung and Tainan, presently use a number of romanizations, including Tongyong Pinyin and postal romanization.

<doc id="296905" wikidata="Q657305" url="?curid=296905" title="2 Stupid Dogs">
<text>2 Stupid Dogs is an American animated television series created by Donovan Cook and produced by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons for on TBS. It originally ran from September 5, 1993 to February 13, 1995, as part of TBS&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Morning in Front of the TV&quot; block and in syndication. The show&#x27;s main segments feature two unnamed dogs, called the &quot;Little Dog&quot; and the &quot;Big Dog&quot; in the credits (voiced by Mark Schiff and Brad Garrett, respectively). The show entirely used digital ink and paint in every episode.

The show has been described as &quot;Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s answer to &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot;&quot;, a hit show created by Hanna-Barbera alumnus John Kricfalusi (who served as a consultant on the series) and premiered two years earlier in 1991 on Nickelodeon. Like Ren and Stimpy, the titular &quot;Dogs&quot; are not very bright, the show is scored with jazz music, and the comedy style leans on gross-out body-secretion humor. Asked about the comparison, Hanna-Barbera CEO Fred Seibert was unconcerned, saying that it was &quot;like Pearl Jam worrying about being compared to Nirvana.&quot; 

A backup segment, Super Secret Secret Squirrel (a sequel series to &quot;Secret Squirrel&quot;), is shown in between the main &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot; cartoons in the first season&#x27;s episodes, similar to early Hanna-Barbera cartoons from the 1960s. The series served as a precursor to the programming of Cartoon Network, where Hanna-Barbera would earn more success with series similar in tone.

==Plot==
The show is about two unnamed dogs—neither of whom, as the title states, is very intelligent—and their everyday misadventures. the Big Dog tends to talk much less than the Little Dog. When the Big Dog talks, he usually talks about food. The animation style in the first season is unusual for the time: a very flat and simplistic style similar to the early Hanna-Barbera cartoons of the 1950s and 1960s, but with early 1990s humor and sensibility. The wilder, more absurd second season has more fluid and exaggerated character animation.

==Characters==

* The Little Dog (voiced by Mark Schiff), a small, tawny-colored Dachshund, is much more energetic and hyperactive than the Big Dog. The Little Dog is very scared of cats, and when a cat (usually the same cat) appears, it is the Big Dog who scares it away.
* The Big Dog (voiced by Brad Garrett) is a large grey Old English Sheepdog with a purple nose. He is much stronger and significantly more stoic and reserved than the Little Dog, and speaks much less – on occasion, he has also been shown to be surprisingly smarter than the Little Dog.
* The Cat is a small innocent cat which the Little Dog is terrified of, despite it being harmless. The Big Dog&#x27;s bark causes the Cat to freeze in terror; however, the Cat is not afraid of the Big Dog unless he barks.
* Mr. Hollywood (voiced by Brian Cummings) is a large man who is both arrogant and loud, and likes to point out others&#x27; mistakes. He has a completely different job in each appearance, including teacher, farmer, casino manager, Noah and pet shop salesman. When pointing out others&#x27; mistakes he will first say, &quot;Well now, isn&#x27;t that cute...&quot; and then yell out, &quot;...but it&#x27;s wrong!&quot;, usually accompanied by a blaring foghorn.
* Cubby (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a fat, spotty man with big glasses, blonde hair and blue lips. In the episodes that he appears in, he works different jobs, like Mr. Hollywood.
* Kenny Fowler (voiced by Jarrett Lennon) is a small skinny kid with nerdy glasses, who is often pushed around by Buzz and often falls down.
* Buzz (voiced by Whit Hertford) is a school bully who picks on Kenny and says &quot;What a Fowler!&quot; whenever Kenny falls or makes a mistake.
* Buffy Ziegenhagen (voiced by Tawni Tamietti) is a girl in Kenny&#x27;s class who he has a crush on and who has a secret crush on him.
* Red (voiced by Candi Milo) is a small, meek little girl that the dogs sometimes encounter in the woods. When she speaks, she shouts one word (sometimes two) in the sentence very loudly compared to the quiet tone of voice she usually has. Trying to visit her grandmother, she ends up in trouble due to her bad eyesight and the dogs&#x27; stupidity.

==Episodes==
===Series overview===
Each episode consists of three segments, with two &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot; shorts bookending a &quot;Super Secret Secret Squirrel&quot; short. Cumulatively, each episode is approximately 22 minutes in length, which amounts to roughly 7 minutes per segment.

===Season 1 (1993)===
Note: All episodes in this season were directed by Donovan Cook.
===Season 2 (1994–95)===
==Home media==
On August 14, 2018, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment (via the Warner Archive Collection) released the first season of the series as &quot;2 Stupid Dogs/Secret Squirrel Show Volume One&quot; on DVD.

==Reception==
Martin &quot;Dr. Toon&quot; Goodman of &quot;Animation World Magazine&quot; described &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot; as one of two &quot;clones&quot; of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; (despite Kricfalusi acting as a consultant on the series), the other one being Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Shnookums &amp; Meat Funny Cartoon Show&quot;. The series was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award but lost to &quot;Rugrats&quot;.

<doc id="296911" wikidata="Q178531" url="?curid=296911" title="Vidin">
<text>Vidin (, ) is a port city on the southern bank of the Danube in north-western Bulgaria. It is close to the borders with Romania and Serbia, and is also the administrative centre of Vidin Province, as well as of the Metropolitan of Vidin (since 870).

An industrial, agricultural, and trade centre, Vidin has a fertile hinterland renowned for its wines.

== Name ==
The name is archaically spelled as &quot;Widdin&quot; in English. Its older form &quot;Dunonia&quot; meant &quot;fortified hill&quot; in Celtic with the &quot;dun&quot; element found frequently in Celtic place names. It is known as &quot;Diiu&quot; in Romanian.

== Geography ==
Vidin is the westernmost important Bulgarian Danube port and is situated on one of the southernmost sections of the river. The New Europe Bridge, completed in 2013, connects Vidin to the Romanian town of Calafat on the opposite bank of the Danube. Previously, a ferry located from the town was in use for that purpose.

== History ==
Vidin emerged at the place of an old Celtic settlement known as &quot;Dunonia&quot;.

The Romans built a fort here (called &quot;Bononia&quot;) on the Danubian Limes frontier system along the Danube and around which a Roman town developed. The town grew into one of the important centres of the province of Upper Moesia, encompassing the territory of modern north-western Bulgaria and eastern Serbia.

=== Middle Ages ===

When Slavs settled in the area, they called the town &quot;Badin&quot; or &quot;Bdin&quot;, where the modern name comes from. Similarly, Anna Komnene refers to it as &quot;Vidynē&quot; (Βιδύνη) in the Alexiad. Vidin&#x27;s main landmark, the Baba Vida fortress, was built in the period from the 10th to the 14th century. In the Middle Ages Vidin used to be an important Bulgarian city, a bishop seat and capital of a large province of the First Bulgarian Empire (681–1018). Between 971 and 976 the town was the center of future Bulgarian emperor Samuil&#x27;s possessions while his brothers ruled to the south. In 1003 Vidin was seized by Basil II after an eight-month siege because of the betrayal of the local bishop. Its importance once again rose during the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185–1422) and its &quot;despots&quot; were influential figures in the Empire and were on several occasions chosen for emperors. From the mid 13th century it was ruled by the Shishman dynasty.

By early 1290s the Kingdom of Serbia expanded towards the vicinity of Vidin, after defeating the Bulgarian rulers of the region of Braničevo, Darman and Kudelin. Threatened by Serbian expansion, the Bulgarian despot Shishman of Vidin failed to repel the Serb forces, and accepted Serbian suzerainty, although in practice, Shishman continued to be independent from Serbian influence and dealt mainly with Bulgaria. Formal Serbian suzerainty lasted until Serbian king Stefan Milutin´s death, in 1321. As Milutin left no testament, after his death, in Serbia occurred a period of civil war with Stefan Dečanski, Stefan Konstantin and Stefan Vladislav II fighting for power. Michael Shishman took advantage of this situation, set free from Serbian overlordship, and returned to the Bulgarian sphere and in 1323 was chosen to be the Bulgarian emperor (tsar). After the death of Michael Shishman in the disastrous battle of Velbazhd in 1330, Vidin passed under the rule of his brother Belaur, who led un unsuccessful rebellion against the new emperor Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria (r. 1331–1371) until his defeat in 1336. In 1356 Ivan Alexander appointed his son Ivan Stratsimir (r. 1356–1396) as a ruler of Vidin, who governed the city and the surrounding region, the Tsardom of Vidin, as a &quot;de facto&quot; independent monarch.

=== Hungarian occupation of Vidin ===

In 1365, the Tsardom of Vidin was occupied by Magyar crusaders. Under Hungarian rule, the city became known as &quot;Bodony&quot;, but the occupation was short-lived. In 1369, the Bulgarian Empire drove out the Hungarian military, but in 1396 Vidin was occupied by a foreign force again this time being the Ottoman Empire under Bayezid I after the Battle of Nicopolis.

=== Ottoman rule ===

The Ottomans went on to conquer the despotates of Dobrudzha, Prilep and Velbazhd as well. Vidin&#x27;s independence did not last long. In 1396, the Ottomans invaded and turned Vidin into a sandjak.

The city fell under Austrian occupation in October 1689 during the Great Turkish War. Both Austrians and the Ottomans had heavy casualties during the siege. The occupation lasted nine months and ended in August 1690. Shortly after Vidin&#x27;s capture, in 19 October 1689 2.500 Muslim men and 1,000 Muslim women from Vidin were deported to Nikopol. The Austrians also built a military facility in front of the Vidin citadel, where they placed more than 40 cannons. During the construction, a large number of Muslim houses and shops were destroyed. Of 3,000 buildings, two hammams, many mosques, shops and coffee shops only 200-300 buildings and several shops survived.

In the late years of Ottoman rule, Vidin was the centre of Ottoman rebel Osman Pazvantoğlu&#x27;s breakaway state.

In 1853, &quot;The Times&quot; of London reported that Widdin, as it was called, was

a considerable town, with a population of about 26,000, and a garrison of 8,000 to 10,000 men. Widdin is one of the important fortified places of the military line of the Danube. It covers the approaches of Servia, commands Little Wallachia, the defiles of Transylvania, and, above all, the opening of the road which leads through Nissia and Sophia on to Adrianople. Its form is an irregular pentagon; it is strongly bastioned, possesses a fortified castle, with two redoubts in the islands, and its defences are completed by an extensive marsh.

In 1859 the English traveler Samuel Baker happened to visit Vidin and spotted the 14-year old Florence Barbara Maria von Sass from Transylvania (then in Hungary now in Romania) being sold into slavery, by some accounts destined to be owned by the Pasha of Vidin. Baker bribed her guards and took her with him, she eventually became Florence Baker, his wife and partner in the exploration of Africa 

Some Muslims from Belgrade, Kladovo, and Smederevo settled in Vidin due to their expulsion from Serbia in 1862.

=== Third Bulgarian State ===
After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 Vidin was included in the reestablished Bulgarian state, the Principality of Bulgaria. The city was unsuccessfully besieged by the Serbian army during the Serbo-Bulgarian War in 1885 and the Second Balkan War in 1913.

== Population ==
Vidin is the 20th town by population in Bulgaria, but serious demographic problems have been experienced in the area during the last two decades. The number of the residents of the city reached its peak between 1988 and 1991 when the population exceeded 65,000. As of 2011, the town had a population of 48,071 inhabitants and 35,784 inhabitants as of 2021.

=== Ethnic, linguistic and religious composition ===
According to the latest 2011 census data, the individuals declared their ethnic identity were distributed as follows:
*Bulgarians: 40,550 (91.8%)
*Roma: 3,335 (7.5%)

== Climate ==
Vidin has a humid subtropical climate close to a temperate continental climate, from which it is shifting further and further away due to global warming. In the winter months, inversions are very common. The average annual temperature is .
== Tourism ==
Vidin maintains two well-preserved medieval fortresses, Baba Vida and Kaleto, as well as many old Orthodox churches such as St Pantaleimon, St Petka (both 17th century), and St Dimitar (Demetrius of Thessaloniki) (19th century), the Vidin Synagogue (1894), the Osman Pazvantoğlu Mosque and library, the late 18th-century Turkish ruler of north-western Bulgaria, the Krastata Kazarma of 1798, and a number of old Renaissance buildings. Also remarkable is the theatre building which was the first Bulgarian theatre in &quot;European model&quot; and was built in 1891. The Vidin Synagogue built in 1894 was in 2021 a shell of its former self; plans are made to turn it into an interfaith cultural center; the Jews of Vidin number about a dozen.

Another tourist attraction in the Vidin area is the town of Belogradchik, famous for its unique and impressive rock formations, the Belogradchik Rocks and the medieval Belogradchik Fortress and also the nearby Magura Cave with its beautiful prehistoric cave paintings.

== Archaeology ==
A fragmented marble structure found near Vidin shows a bearded man in a Phrygian cap and Roman armor, identified as Jupiter Dolichenus, holding a thunderbolt and likely a bipennis. This piece, dating from the late 2nd or early 3rd century, aligns with similar depictions of the deity found in other regions, suggesting a common iconographic theme.

== Transportation ==

In Vidin is a border-station to neighbouring Romania via the Danube river. It was operated by ferryboats only until 14 June 2013 when the Vidin–Calafat Bridge opened. Crossing by ferry was possible only every hour with just five trucks per ferry. Ticket prices were €50 per truck and €12 per car.

The city has a regional airport (Vidin Airport, ICAO code &quot;LBVD&quot;) a few kilometres to the north-west; , there is no scheduled passenger service, and the buildings are in a state of disrepair. There are, however, state development plans to rebuild and restore the activity of Vidin airport.

== Landmarks ==
Close to the town lies a powerful medium wave broadcasting station (since 1973) whose signals can be easily received throughout Europe. It works on 576 khz with a power of 500 kW. For transmission on 576 kHz a guyed mast equipped with a cage antenna at its lower part is used. A powerful FM transmitter on 88.2 MHz provides good coverage for Hristo Botev radio. Also, Horizont and Radio Vidin are broadcast on 102.3 and 103.9 MHz with similar coverage to Hristo Botev

== Honour ==
Vidin Heights on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Vidin.

<doc id="296912" wikidata="Q352963" url="?curid=296912" title="James Agee">
<text>James Rufus Agee ( ; November 27, 1909 – May 16, 1955) was an American novelist, journalist, poet, screenwriter and film critic. In the 1940s, writing for &quot;Time&quot;, he was one of the most influential film critics in the United States. His autobiographical novel, &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; (1957), won the author a posthumous 1958 Pulitzer Prize. Agee is also known as a co-writer of the book &quot;Let Us Now Praise Famous Men&quot; and as the screenwriter of the film classics &quot;The African Queen&quot; and &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Agee was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, to Hugh James Agee and Laura Whitman Tyler, at Highland Avenue and 15th Street, which was renamed James Agee Street, in what is now the Fort Sanders neighborhood. When Agee was six, his father was killed in an automobile accident. From the age of seven, Agee and his younger sister, Emma, were educated in several boarding schools. The most prominent of these was near his mother&#x27;s summer cottage two miles from Sewanee, Tennessee. Saint Andrews School for Mountain Boys was run by the monastic Order of the Holy Cross affiliated with the Episcopal Church. It was there that Agee&#x27;s lifelong friendship with Episcopal priest Father James Harold Flye, a history teacher at St. Andrew&#x27;s, and his wife, Grace Eleanor Houghton, began in 1919. As Agee&#x27;s close friend and mentor, Flye corresponded with him on literary and other topics through life and became a confidant of Agee&#x27;s soul-wrestling. He published the letters after Agee&#x27;s death. &quot;The New York Times&quot; Book Review called &quot;The Letters of James Agee to Father Flye&quot; (1962) &quot;comparable in importance to F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &#x27;The Crackup&#x27; and Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s letters as a self-portrait of the artist in the modern American scene.&quot;

Agee&#x27;s mother married St. Andrew&#x27;s bursar Father Erskine Wright in 1924, and the two moved to Rockland, Maine. Agee went to Knoxville High School for the 1924–25 school year, then traveled with Flye to Europe in the summer, when Agee was 16. On their return, Agee transferred to a boarding school in New Hampshire, entering the class of 1928 at Phillips Exeter Academy. Soon after, he began a correspondence with Dwight Macdonald.

At Phillips Exeter, Agee was president of The Lantern Club and editor of the &quot;Monthly&quot;, where his first short stories, plays, poetry and articles were published. Despite barely passing many of his high school courses, Agee was admitted to Harvard College&#x27;s class of 1932, where he lived in Thayer Hall and Eliot House. At Harvard, Agee took classes taught by Robert Hillyer and I. A. Richards; his classmate in those was the future poet and critic Robert Fitzgerald, with whom he later worked at &quot;Time&quot;. Agee was editor-in-chief of the &quot;Harvard Advocate&quot; and delivered the class ode at his commencement.

==Career==
After graduation, Agee was hired by Time Inc. as a reporter, and moved to New York City, where he wrote for &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine from 1932 to 1937, although he is better known for his later film criticism in &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;. In 1934, he published his only volume of poetry, &quot;Permit Me Voyage&quot;, with a foreword by Archibald MacLeish.

In the summer of 1936, Agee spent eight weeks on assignment for &quot;Fortune&quot; with photographer Walker Evans, living among sharecroppers in Alabama. &quot;Fortune&quot; did not publish his article, but Agee turned the material into his 1941 book &quot;Let Us Now Praise Famous Men&quot;. It sold only 600 copies before being remaindered. Another manuscript from the same assignment discovered in 2003, titled &quot;Cotton Tenants,&quot; is believed to be the essay submitted to &quot;Fortune&quot; editors. The 30,000-word text, accompanied by photographs by Walker Evans, was published as a book in June 2013. John Jeremiah Sullivan wrote, &quot;This is not merely an early, partial draft of Famous Men, in other words, not just a different book; it&#x27;s a different Agee, an unknown Agee. Its excellence should enhance his reputation.&quot; A significant difference between the works is the use of original names in &quot;Cotton Tenants&quot;; Agee assigned fictional names to the subjects of &quot;Famous Men&quot; to protect their identity.

Agee left &quot;Fortune&quot; in 1937 while working on a book, then, in 1939, he took a book reviewing job at &quot;Time&quot;, sometimes reviewing up to six books per week; together, he and his friend Whittaker Chambers ran &quot;the back of the book&quot; for &quot;Time&quot;. In 1941, he became &quot;Time&#x27;s&quot; film critic. From 1942 to 1948, he worked as a film critic for &quot;The Nation&quot;. Agee was an ardent champion of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s then unpopular film &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot; (1947), since recognized as a classic. He was a great admirer of Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, especially &quot;Henry V&quot;. He also was an ardent champion of D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation,&quot; which he lavishly praised for its stylistic innovations and virtuosity without critically commenting on its celebration of the Ku Klux Klan. &quot;Agee on Film&quot; (1958) collected his writings of this period. Three writers listed it as one of the best film-related books ever written in a 2010 poll by the British Film Institute.

In 1948, Agee quit his job to become a freelance writer. One of his assignments was a well-received article for &quot;Life Magazine&quot; about the silent movie comedians Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Harry Langdon. The article has been credited for reviving Keaton&#x27;s career. As a freelancer in the 1950s, Agee continued to write magazine articles while working on movie scripts; he developed a friendship with photographer Helen Levitt.

===Screenwriting===
In 1947 and 1948, Agee wrote an untitled screenplay for Charlie Chaplin, in which the Tramp survives a nuclear holocaust; posthumously titled &quot;The Tramp&#x27;s New World&quot;, the text was published in 2005. The commentary Agee wrote for the 1948 documentary &quot;The Quiet One&quot; was his first contribution to a film that was completed and released.

Agee&#x27;s career as a movie scriptwriter was curtailed by his alcoholism. Nevertheless, he is one of the credited screenwriters on two of the most respected films of the 1950s: &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; (1955).

His contribution to &quot;Hunter&quot; is shrouded in controversy. Some critics have claimed that the published script was written by the film&#x27;s director, Charles Laughton. Reports that Agee&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Hunter&quot; was not used have been proved false by the 2004 discovery of his first draft, which although 293 pages in length, contains many scenes included in the film that Laughton directed. Laughton seemed to have edited great parts of the script because it was too long. While not yet published, the first draft has been read by scholars, most notably Jeffrey Couchman of Columbia University. He credited Agee in the essay, &quot;Credit Where Credit Is Due&quot;. Also false were reports that Agee was fired from the film. Laughton renewed Agee&#x27;s contract and directed him to cut the script in half, which Agee did. Later, apparently at Robert Mitchum&#x27;s request, Agee visited the set to settle a dispute between the star and Laughton. Letters and documents in the archive of Agee&#x27;s agent Paul Kohner bear this out; they were documented by Laughton&#x27;s biographer Simon Callow, whose BFI book about &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; sets this part of the record straight. Couchman, the author of a 2009 book about &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, writes that Agee&#x27;s screenplay would have been a film about six hours long, so Laughton had to cut and edit a considerable part of it.

== Personal life ==
Soon after graduation from Harvard University, he married Olivia Saunders (aka &quot;Via&quot;) on January 28, 1933; they divorced in 1938. Later that same year, he married Alma Mailman. They divorced in 1941, and Alma moved to Mexico with their year-old son Joel to live with Communist politician and writer Bodo Uhse. Agee began living in Greenwich Village with Mia Fritsch, whom he married in 1946. They had two daughters, Julia (1946–2016, known throughout life as Deedee) and Andrea, and a son, John.

==Death==
In 1951 in Santa Barbara, Agee, a hard drinker and chain-smoker, suffered a heart attack; on May 16, 1955, he was in Manhattan when he suffered a fatal heart attack in a taxi cab en route to a doctor&#x27;s appointment. He was buried on a farm he owned at Hillsdale, New York, property still held by Agee descendants.

==Legacy==
During his lifetime, Agee enjoyed only modest public recognition. Since his death, his literary reputation has grown. In 1957, his novel &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; (based on the events surrounding his father&#x27;s death) was published posthumously and in 1958 won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. In 2007, Michael Lofaro published a restored edition of the novel using Agee&#x27;s original manuscripts. Agee&#x27;s work had been heavily edited before its original publication by publisher David McDowell.

Agee&#x27;s reviews and screenplays have been collected in two volumes of &quot;Agee on Film&quot;. There is some dispute over the extent of his participation in the writing of &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;.

&quot;Let Us Now Praise Famous Men&quot; has grown to be considered Agee&#x27;s masterpiece. Ignored on its original publication in 1941, the book has been placed among the greatest literary works of the 20th century by the New York School of Journalism and the New York Public Library. It was the inspiration for the Aaron Copland opera &quot;The Tender Land&quot;. David Simon, journalist and creator of acclaimed television series &quot;The Wire&quot;, credited the book with impacting him early in his career and influencing his practice of journalism.

The composer Samuel Barber set sections of &quot;Descriptions of Elysium&quot; from &quot;Permit Me Voyage&quot; to music, composing a song based on &quot;Sure On This Shining Night&quot;. In addition, he set prose from the &quot;Knoxville&quot; section of &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; in his work for soprano and orchestra titled &quot;.&quot; &quot;Sure On This Shining Night&quot; has also been set to music by composers René Clausen, Z. Randall Stroope, and Morten Lauridsen.

In late 1979, the filmmaker Ross Spears premiered his film &quot;AGEE: A Sovereign Prince of the English Language&quot;, which was later nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and was awarded a Blue Ribbon at the 1980 American Film Festival. &quot;AGEE&quot; featured four of James Agee&#x27;s friends—Dwight Macdonald, Robert Fitzgerald, Robert Saudek, and John Huston—as well as the three women to whom James Agee had been married. In addition, Father James Harold Flye was a featured interviewee. President Jimmy Carter speaks about his favorite book, &quot;Let Us Now Praise Famous Men&quot;.

&quot;The Man Who Lives Here Is Loony&quot;, a one-act play by Knoxville-based songwriter and playwright RB Morris, takes place in a New York apartment during one night in Agee&#x27;s life. The play has been performed at venues around Knoxville, and at the Cornelia Street Cafe in Greenwich Village.

<doc id="296915" wikidata="Q182428" url="?curid=296915" title="Silistra">
<text>Silistra ( ; ; or ) is a town in Northeastern Bulgaria. The town lies on the southern bank of the lower Danube river, and is also the part of the Romanian border where it stops following the Danube. Silistra is the administrative center of the Silistra Province and one of the important towns of the historical region of Dobruja.

Silistra is a major cultural, industrial, transportation, and educational center of Northeastern Bulgaria. There are many historical landmarks including a richly-decorated Late Roman tomb, remains of the medieval fortress, an Ottoman fort, and an art gallery.

== Etymology ==
The name Silistra is possibly derived from the root of the old Thracian name of the lower part of the Danube &quot;Istrum&quot;.

The name of the city is given as &quot;Silistria&quot; in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition.
== Geography ==

Silistra is in the northeastern part of Bulgaria on the southern bank of the Danube River. It is located in the Bulgarian part of Dobruja.

The municipality of Silistra covers an area of 516 km2 and includes the town and 18 villages. The area of the city proper is 27.159 km2.

Silistra is 431 km from Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria; 141 km from Varna; and 119 km from Ruse.
=== Climate ===
Silistra has a temperate climate, with cold snowy winters and hot summers.
== History ==
After the Roman province of Moesia was founded in 12 AD, the Romans built a fort in 29 on the site of an earlier Thracian settlement and kept its name, &quot;Durostorum&quot; (or &quot;Dorostorum&quot;). During the reigns of Claudius (41-54 AD) and Nero (54-68), the eastern border of Moesia was extended to the mouth of the river Iatrus (the modern Yantra). Durostorum was one of several important river points along the Moesian Limes frontier. After Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars the fort was enlarged into a legionary fortress for the Legio XI Claudia who stayed there from before 114 until c. 400. It became an important military centre of the Roman province of Moesia, and grew into a city at the time of Marcus Aurelius. The city was strongly affected by an invasion of the Costoboci in 170. 

Large thermal baths have been discovered in the &quot;canabae&quot; and residential buildings to the south. There were six periods of construction between the 2nd and 4th centuries AD.

When the Roman Empire split into the Eastern and Western empires, the town became part of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Durostorum became the seat of a Christian bishopric and a centre of Christianity in the region. The earliest saints of Bulgaria are Roman soldiers executed at Durostorum during the Diocletian Persecution (303–313), including St. Dasius and St. Julius the Veteran. Auxentius was expelled from Durostorum by an edict of Theodosius depriving Arian bishops in 383, and took refuge at Milan where he became embroiled in controversy with St Ambrose. The Roman general Flavius Aëtius was born in the town in 396. 

As part of the Bulgarian Empire Durostolon was known as &quot;Drastar&quot; in medieval times.

Around the end of the 7th century, the town was incorporated into the First Bulgarian Empire and the bishop of ( in Bulgarian) was proclaimed the first patriarch of Bulgaria. In 895 (during the Bulgarian-Hungarian War of 894–896), the Hungarians, allies of the Byzantines, besieged the Bulgarian army under the personal command of Simeon I the Great in the fortress of the town but were repulsed. The next year the Hungarians were decisively defeated in the battle of Southern Buh.

The town was captured by the forces of Sviatoslav I of Kiev in 969, but two years later it was taken by the Byzantines during the Battle of Dorostolon. In 976, Tsar Samuel restored Bulgarian rule in the region until 1001, when it once again became part of the Byzantine Empire as &quot;Dristra&quot;. Emperor Alexios I Komnenos suffered a defeat at Dristra to the Pechenegs in 1087.

In 1186, after the Rebellion of Asen and Peter, the town became part of the Second Bulgarian Empire and renamed Drastar.

In 1279, under Emperor Ivailo, Drastar was attacked by the Mongols; but after a three-month-long siege the Bulgarians managed to break through. The town remained part of the Bulgarian Empire until the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans around 1400. Throughout the Middle Ages, Drastar (possibly known by the name Silistra too) was among Bulgaria&#x27;s largest and most important cities.

During Ottoman rule, Silistra (Ottoman Turkish: ) was part of Rumelia Province and was the administrative centre of the Silistra district (&quot;sanjak&quot;). This district was later upgraded to become the Silistra Province and stretched over most of the western Black Sea littoral. In 1570 (Hijri 977) the town of Silistra was inhabited by Muslims and Christians. It had 447 Muslim households in 20 neighbourhoods and 633 Non-muslim households in 15 neighbourhoods. The defter also recorded that there was a Jewish and a Christian Romani congregation. 

The town was captured and recaptured by Russian forces numerous times during several Russo-Turkish Wars and was besieged between 14 April and 23 June 1854 during the Crimean War. Namık Kemal wrote his most famous play, &quot;Vatan Yahut Silistre&quot; (&quot;Homeland or Silistre&quot;), a drama about the siege of Silistra (&quot;Silistria&quot;), in which he expounded on the ideas of patriotism and liberalism. The play was first staged on 1 April 1873 and led to his exile to Famagusta.

The Ottoman Silistra Province was reduced in size, as the districts of Özi and Hocabey and the region of Bessarabia were ceded to the Russian Empire at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. Edirne Province was created from its southern regions in 1830. Finally, Silistra Province merged with the provinces of Vidin and Niš in 1864 to form Danube Province. Silistra was downgraded to a &quot;kaza&quot; centre in Ruse district in this province in the same year.

Between 1819 and 1826, Eliezer Papo — a renowned Jewish scholar — was the rabbi of the community of Silistra, making this town famous among observant Jews. Up to the present, his grave is a focus of pilgrimage, some pilgrims flying from Israel and even from Latin America to Bulgaria for that purpose.

In 1878, following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Silistra was included in Bulgaria. Romania was opposed to this as it wanted to acquire the city and established the short-lived Silistra Nouă County, which was abolished a year later.

In May 1913, following the Second Balkan War and after unsuccessful Bulgarian-Romanian negotiations in London, the two countries accepted the mediation of the Great Powers, who awarded Silistra and the area in a 3 km radius around it to Romania at the Saint Petersburg Conference. The 1913 Treaty of Bucharest ceded Silistra and the whole of Southern Dobruja to Romania. Bulgaria regained the town from 1916 during World War I. This became finalised with the Treaty of Bucharest in 1918 after Romania surrendered to the Central Powers (of which Bulgaria was a part). The Treaty of Neuilly (1919) following World War I returned it to Romania. Silistra remained a part of Romania until the Axis-sponsored Treaty of Craiova in 1940, when the town once again became part of Bulgaria, a transfer confirmed by the Paris Peace Treaties in 1947. Between 1913 and 1938, Silistra was the capital of Durostor County (except during Bulgarian rule). It became part of Ținutul Mării (&quot;Sea District&quot;) between 1938 and 1940 during Romanian rule. Following the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, Silistra developed as a center of industry and agriculture in the region, comparable to Ruse (because of the strategic position on the Danube) and Dobrich (due to the abundant fertile lands). This led to a major population increase which continued until 1985. After that, the population slowly started to decrease. Following the collapse of the People&#x27;s Republic in 1989, many of its inhabitants migrated to other parts of the country or emigrated outside Bulgaria.

== Population ==
In January 2012, Silistra was inhabited by 35,230 people within the city limits, while the Silistra Municipality along with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 50,780 inhabitants. The number of the residents of the city (not the municipality) reached its peak in the period 1986–1991, when it exceeded 70,000. The following table presents the change of the population after 1887.

<text>Gorzów Wielkopolski (), often abbreviated to Gorzów Wlkp. or simply Gorzów (formerly ), is a city in western Poland, located on the Warta River. It is one of the two principal cities and seats of the Lubusz Voivodeship, with a population of 114,567 .

The city has a history dating back to the 13th century and serves as a cultural, economic, and industrial hub in the region. Gorzów Wielkopolski is home to several historical landmarks, green spaces, and educational institutions, and is known for its strong tradition in speedway racing.

Around Gorzów, there are two large forest areas: Gorzów Woods to the north, where the Barlinek-Gorzów Landscape Park is situated, and Noteć Woods to the southeast. The biggest oil fields in Poland are located near Gorzów.

== Etymology ==
The pre-1945 German name &quot;Landsberg an der Warthe&quot;, dating back to 1257, derived from the German words &quot;land&quot; or &#x27;state&#x27; and &quot;berg&quot; or &#x27;mountain&#x27; combined with &quot;Warthe&quot;the German name for the river Warta.

The Polish name Gorzów, written as Gorzew, is known from Polish maps and historical books dating back to the 19th century or perhaps earlier. The name appeared in a compendium called &quot;Ancient Poland according to its history, geography and statistics&quot; published in 1848 by Samuel Orgelbrand in Warsaw. Ten years earlier, in 1838, the same name Gorzew was used in a book published in Paris with a corresponding yet broader title encompassing all of Poland.

The current spelling of &quot;Gorzów&quot; appears on the map featuring &quot;Królestwo Polskie&quot; published in Lwów in 1900 with &quot;Landsberg an der Warthe&quot; in parentheses next to &quot;Gorzów&quot;. The name is interpreted in several different ways according to rules of the Old Polish language, originating from &quot;gorzenie&quot; (fire, burning) or gora- gorze (mountain - of from the mountain) or &quot;pogorzelcy&quot; (survivors of a fire), or alternatively &quot;gorzelnia&quot; (distillery) or &quot;gorzałka&quot; (spirits).

The place originated as a craftsmen settlement during the medieval period of the Polish royal dynasty of Piast.

In Polish, it was the name &#x27;Gorzów&#x27; which eventually stuck, beating the alternative postwar name &quot;Kobylagóra&quot;, or &#x27;Mare Mountain&#x27;, which survives today as the name of a street in the city. The word &quot;Wielkopolski&quot; means &quot;Greater Polish&quot;, after the voivodeship of that name of which Gorzów was a part from 1946 to 1950, was added later. The area of today&#x27;s Gorzów was part of the historical region of Greater Poland until the mid-13th century.

== History ==

During the reign of the first Polish monarchs of the Piast dynasty there was a craft and trade settlement and until the mid-13th century, the land where the river Kłodawka meets the Warta was the location of a defensive fort established by the Polish Piast dynasty. In 1249 the Silesian Duke Bolesław II Rogatka had sold Lubusz Land in the west to the Ascanian Margraves of Brandenburg, and the city of &quot;Landisberch Nova&quot; (named after Altlandsberg) was founded on the site in 1257. The city was at that time an eastern outpost of the newly established Neumark region of Brandenburg, close to the Greater Polish fortress of Santok. After a war broke out over control of the region in 1319, the town came under control of the Duchy of Pomerania, but by 1325 it fell to Brandenburg again. In 1325 Polish, in 1432 Hussite troops beleaguered the city. In 1373 the city became part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (or &quot;Czech Lands&quot;), ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with Poland in Kraków. Poland was to buy and re-incorporate Gorzów and the surrounding region, but eventually the Luxembourgs sold the city to the Teutonic Order. In 1454, after the Thirteen Years’ War broke out, the Teutonic Knights sold the city to Brandenburg in order to raise funds for war against Poland. In the 16th century, the city became Lutheran, with St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral changing its allegiance in 1537.

In 1701 Landsberg (Gorzów) became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. On 4 February 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars the Russian Ataman Aleksandr Chernichev and his Cossack troops defeated a French battalion of 1,500 men of Louis-Nicolas Davout&#x27;s corps. In 1815 – in the course of an administrative restructuring – the town became part of Prussia&#x27;s Province of Brandenburg. One of the main escape routes for surviving insurgents of the Polish November Uprising from partitioned Poland to the Great Emigration led through the city. The city, like all of Prussia, was included in the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany.
During World War II, the Germans established nine forced labour camps, as well as four labour units of the Stalag III-C prisoner-of-war camp for French, Italian and Soviet prisoners of war in the city.

In early 1945 during World War II the town was heavily damaged following the retreat of the Wehrmacht ahead of the Soviet Red Army. The Red Army arrived in the city on 30 January 1945, approaching from the left bank of the river Warta. The Wehrmacht had already evacuated most of the city, and the advancing forces met very little resistance. Over the next few days, most of the city centre was destroyed, reportedly through the accidental spread of a fire started in order to light the westward march of the Red Army.
The city became part of Poland in accordance with border changes promulgated at the postwar Potsdam Conference, supposedly pending a final peace conference with Germany. Since a peace conference never took place, the town was effectively ceded to Poland. German residents who had not fled or died in the war were expelled in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement, and the city was gradually repopulated with Polish settlers from central Poland and those expelled from Polish territory annexed by the Soviet Union. The last German inhabitants were forced to leave the city in the early 1950s. It was at this time that Gorzów&#x27;s now sizable Tatar and Romani communities arrived in the town. Not having had an agreed Polish name, the town was initially renamed as &quot;Kobylagóra&quot; on 30 May 1945, later as &quot;Gorzów nad Wartą&quot; on 7 July 1945 and finally &quot;Gorzów Wielkopolski&quot; on 5 November 1946.

Between 1975 and 1998, it was the capital of the Gorzów Voivodeship.

The city centre is overwhelmingly occupied by Communist-era buildings, although many have been beautified, most notably those around the old market square. Many of the façades of the buildings in the centre were renovated in anticipation of the visit of Pope John Paul II to Gorzów in 1997. Due to the high number of parks and green spaces, Gorzów has been termed &#x27;the city of parks and gardens&#x27;. In addition to the central Park of Roses, there is also a viewing area on the hilltop of Siemiradzki Park which commands impressive views across the plains and woods to the south of the city.

The city also contains the museum of Lubusz Voivodeship, which is divided between two sites.

The museum, housed inside, frequently plays host to art exhibitions and has a permanent collection of artifacts and photographs relating to the history of the city. The other part of the museum, on Warszawska street, is housed in the secessionist villa of Gustav Schroeder. This section contains a wide range of artifacts, ranging from portraits of the 17th century, to weapons, pottery, and the Biedermeier interior furnishings of the villa itself.

==Career==
Iglesias has appeared in many local and international covers of gossip and entertainment magazines worldwide, at a young age, as the entertainment industry made the Iglesiases one of their favourite celebrity families. After the kidnapping of her grandfather in 1981, her father Julio Iglesias decided to move her and her brothers to safety in Miami in the United States, where she lived in protective custody. During the 1990s, Iglesias appeared in several American talk shows. This was followed by a television show called &quot;El Show de Chábeli&quot;, which aired on Univision. 

==Personal life==
Chábeli Iglesias was married to Ricardo Bofill Jr, the son of Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill. Their marriage ended three years later.

In June 1999, Iglesias was involved in a car accident in Los Angeles in California, requiring hospitalization. She was in the passenger seat when the vehicle rolled over several times and both passengers were ejected.

On 8 October 2001, she married businessman Christian Fernando Altaba. Their son Alejandro Altaba was born prematurely on 14 January 2002. Alejandro&#x27;s godparents are Julio Iglesias, Jr. and Ana Boyer.

On 2 February 2010, Iglesias announced that she was pregnant with twin girls who were expected to be born in the summer of 2010. However, on 12 March 2010, &quot;People en Español&quot; reported that she had suffered a miscarriage.
In February 2012 she announced that she and her husband had become parents of a daughter, Sofia Altaba on 4 January 2012, after a pregnancy kept totally secret.

<text>Robert Lockwood Jr., a.k.a. Robert Jr. Lockwood, (March 27, 1915 – November 21, 2006) was an American Delta blues guitarist, who recorded for Chess Records and other Chicago labels in the 1950s and 1960s. He was the only guitarist to have learned to play directly from Robert Johnson. Robert Lockwood was one of the first professional black entertainers to appear on radio in the South, on the &quot;King Biscuit Time&quot; radio show. Lockwood is known for his longtime collaboration with Sonny Boy Williamson II and for his work in the mid-1950s with Little Walter.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lockwood was born in Turkey Scratch, Arkansas, a hamlet west of Helena. He was one of two children born to Robert Lockwood Sr. and Esther Reese Lockwood, later known as Estella Coleman. He started playing the organ in his father&#x27;s church at the age of eight. His parents divorced, and later the famous bluesman Robert Johnson lived with Lockwood&#x27;s mother for 10 years off and on.

Lockwood learned from Johnson not only how to play guitar but also timing and stage presence. Because of his personal and professional association with Johnson, he became known as &quot;Robert Junior&quot; Lockwood, a nickname by which he was known among musicians for the rest of his life, although he later frequently professed his dislike for this appellation.

===Early career===
By age 15, Lockwood was playing professionally at parties in the Helena area. He often played with his quasi-stepfather Robert Johnson and with Sonny Boy Williamson II and Johnny Shines. Lockwood played at fish fries, in juke joints, and on street corners throughout the Mississippi Delta in the 1930s. On one occasion he played on one side of the Sunflower River while Johnson played on the other, with the people of Clarksdale, Mississippi, milling about the bridge, reportedly unable to tell which guitarist was the real Robert Johnson.

Around 1937–1938 Lockwood worked with Williamson and Elmore James in the Delta, at places like Winona, Greenwood, and Greenville (where they most probably met Johnson, who died in 1938). Lockwood played with Williamson in the Clarksdale area in 1938 and 1939. He also played with Howlin&#x27; Wolf and others in Memphis, Tennessee, around 1938. From 1939 to 1940 he split his time playing in St. Louis, Missouri; Chicago; and Helena.

On July 1, 1941, Lockwood made his first recordings, with Doctor Clayton, for the Bluebird label in Aurora, Illinois. On July 30 he recorded four songs, which were released as the first two 78-rpm singles under his own name: &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot; backed with &quot;Take a Little Walk with Me&quot; (Bluebird B-8820) and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Train My Baby&quot; backed with &quot;Black Spider Blues&quot; (Bluebird B-8877). These songs remained in his repertoire throughout his career.

In 1941, Lockwood and Williamson began their influential performances on the daily radio program &quot;King Biscuit Time&quot; on KFFA in Helena. For several years in the early 1940s the pair played together in and around Helena and continued to be associated with &quot;King Biscuit Time&quot;. From about 1944 to 1949 Lockwood played in West Memphis, Arkansas; St. Louis; Chicago and Memphis. He was an influence on B. B. King and played in King&#x27;s band early in King&#x27;s career in Memphis.

In 1950, Lockwood settled in Chicago. A 1951 78-rpm single featured &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Dig Myself a Hole&quot; backed with &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; (Mercury 8260), and a 1954 release contained &quot;Aw Aw (Baby)&quot; backed with &quot;Sweet Woman (from Maine)&quot; (J.O.B 1107). In 1954, he replaced Louis Myers as the guitarist in Little Walter&#x27;s band. He played on Walter&#x27;s number 1 hit &quot;My Babe&quot; in 1955. He left the band around 1957. In the late 1950s he recorded several sessions with Sonny Boy Williamson for Chess Records, sessions which also included Willie Dixon and Otis Spann. Lockwood also performed or recorded with Sunnyland Slim, Eddie Boyd, Roosevelt Sykes, J. B. Lenoir, and Muddy Waters, among others.

===Later career===

In 1960, Lockwood moved with Williamson to Cleveland, Ohio, where he resided for the second half of his life. In the early 1960s, as Bob Lockwood Jr. and Combo, he had a regular gig at Loving&#x27;s Grill, at 8426 Hough Avenue. From the 1970s through the 2000s, he performed regularly with his band the All Stars at numerous local venues, including Pirate&#x27;s Cove, the Euclid Tavern, Peabody&#x27;s, Flipside Tavern, Wilbert&#x27;s, Brother&#x27;s Lounge, and, in the last years of his career, Fat Fish Blue (on the corner of Prospect and Ontario in downtown Cleveland) every Wednesday night. He played his regular three sets two days before the illness which led to his death. The All Stars continued the Wednesday residency for two years after his death.

His studio albums as a bandleader include &quot;Steady Rollin&#x27; Man&quot;, with the Aces (recorded 1970, Delmark); &quot;Contrasts&quot; (recorded 1973, Trix); &quot;...Does 12&quot; (recorded 1975, Trix); &quot;Hangin&#x27; On&quot;, with Johnny Shines (recorded 1979, Rounder); &quot;Mister Blues Is Back to Stay&quot;, with Shines (recorded 1980, Rounder); &quot;What&#x27;s the Score&quot; (recorded 1990, Lockwood); and &quot;I Got to Find Me a Woman&quot; (recorded 1996, Verve). A 1972 45-rpm single included &quot;Selfish Ways&quot; backed with &quot;Down Home Cookin&#x27;&quot; (Big Star BB 020). Reviewing &quot;Does 12&quot; in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said, &quot;Lovers of urban blues will cherish this record by Robert Johnson&#x27;s self-designated heir. It even boasts some adventurously progressive saxophone and twelve-string stylings that do no violence to a notoriously intransigent genre. But Lockwood is an undistinguished vocal interpreter, and only one of his originals—the imperturbable &#x27;Selfish Ways&#x27;—is worthy of interpretation itself.&quot;

His solo guitar and vocal albums include &quot;Plays Robert and Robert&quot; (recorded 1982, Evidence), &quot;Delta Crossroads&quot; (recorded 2000, Telarc) and &quot;The Legend Live&quot; (recorded 2003, M.C.). A duet session with the pianist Otis Spann in 1960 resulted in &quot;Otis Spann Is the Blues&quot; and &quot;Walking the Blues&quot;, released by Candid.

At the age of 60, in 1975, he discovered the 12-string guitar and preferentially played it almost exclusively for the latter third of his life. His most famous 12-string was a blue instrument custom designed and made by the Japanese luthiers Moony Omote and Age Sumi. It was acquired by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in February 2013 and is displayed there.

A live performance by Lockwood, Henry &quot;Mule&quot; Townsend, Joseph &quot;Pinetop&quot; Perkins, and David &quot;Honeyboy&quot; Edwards, recorded in 2004 and released in 2007 as &quot;Last of the Great Mississippi Delta Bluesmen: Live in Dallas&quot;, won a Grammy Award in 2008 in the Best Traditional Blues Album category. It was the first Grammy Award for Lockwood and Townsend. Two of Lockwood&#x27;s other albums were nominated for Grammys: &quot;I Got to Find Me a Woman&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Delta Crossroads&quot; in 2001.

Lockwood&#x27;s last known recording session was at Ante Up Audio studio in Cleveland, with longtime collaborator Mark &quot;Cleveland Fats&quot; Hahn, to record the album &quot;The Way Things Go&quot; for Honeybee Entertainment.

Lockwood died at the age of 91 in Cleveland, having suffered a cerebral aneurysm and a stroke. He is buried at Riverside Cemetery, in Cleveland.

His survivors included his wife, Mary Smith Lockwood of Cleveland; four stepchildren from his first marriage to Annie Roberts Lockwood, who died in 1997; and four stepchildren from his second marriage.

<text>The domestic turkey (Meleagris gallopavo domesticus) is a large fowl, one of the two species in the genus &quot;Meleagris&quot; and the same species as the wild turkey. Although turkey domestication was thought to have occurred in central Mesoamerica at least 2,000 years ago, recent research suggests a possible second domestication event in the area that is now the southwestern United States between 200 BC and 500 AD. However, all of the main domestic turkey varieties today descend from the turkey raised in central Mexico that was subsequently imported into Europe by the Spanish in the 16th century.

The domestic turkey is a popular form of poultry. It is raised throughout temperate parts of the world, partially because industrialized farming has made it very cheap for the amount of meat it produces. Female domestic turkeys are called &quot;hens&quot;, and the chicks are &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;. In Canada and the United States, male turkeys are called &quot;toms&quot;. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, they are &quot;stags&quot;.

The great majority of domestic turkeys are bred to have white feathers because their pin feathers are less visible when the carcass is dressed, although brown or bronze-feathered varieties are also raised. The fleshy protuberance atop the beak is the snood and the one attached to the underside of the beak is known as a wattle.

The English-language name for this species results from an early misidentification of the bird with an unrelated species which was imported to Europe through the country of Turkey. The Latin species name means &quot;chicken peacock&quot;.

==History==

The modern domestic turkey is descended from the South Mexican subspecies (the nominate subspecies &quot;M. g. gallopavo&quot;) of wild turkey, found in Central Mexico in a region bounded by the present Mexican states of Jalisco to the northwest, Guerrero to the southwest, and Veracruz to the east. Ancient Mesoamericans domesticated this subspecies, using its meat and eggs as major sources of protein and employing its feathers extensively for decorative purposes. The Aztecs associated the turkey with their trickster god Tezcatlipoca, perhaps because of its perceived humorous behavior.

Domestic turkeys were taken to Europe by the Spanish. Many distinct breeds were developed in Europe (e.g. Spanish Black, Royal Palm). In the early 20th century, many advances were made in the breeding of turkeys, resulting in breeds such as the Beltsville Small White.

The 16th-century English navigator William Strickland is generally credited with introducing the turkey into England. His family coat of arms – showing a turkey cock as the family crest – is among the earliest known European depictions of a turkey. English farmer Thomas Tusser notes the turkey being among farmer&#x27;s fare at Christmas in 1573. The domestic turkey was sent from England to Jamestown, Virginia in 1608. A document written in 1584 lists supplies to be furnished to future colonies in the New World; &quot;turkies, male and female&quot;.

Prior to the late 19th century, turkey was something of a luxury in the UK, with goose or beef a more common Christmas dinner among the working classes. In Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843), Bob Cratchit had a goose before Scrooge bought him a turkey.

Turkey production in the UK was centered in East Anglia, using two breeds, the Norfolk Black and the Norfolk Bronze (also known as Cambridge Bronze). These would be driven as flocks, after shoeing, down to markets in London from the 17th century onwards – the breeds having arrived in the early 16th century via Spain.

Intensive farming of turkeys from the late 1940s dramatically cut the price, making it more affordable for the working classes. With the availability of refrigeration, whole turkeys could be shipped frozen to distant markets. Later advances in disease control increased production even more. Advances in shipping, changing consumer preferences and the proliferation of commercial poultry plants has made fresh turkey inexpensive as well as readily available.

Recent genome analysis has provided researchers with the opportunity to determine the evolutionary history of domestic turkeys, and their relationship to other domestic fowl.

==Behavior==

Young domestic turkeys readily fly short distances, perch and roost. These behaviours become less frequent as the birds mature, but adults will readily climb on objects such as bales of straw. Young birds perform spontaneous, frivolous running (&#x27;frolicking&#x27;) which has all the appearance of play. Commercial turkeys show a wide diversity of behaviours including &#x27;comfort&#x27; behaviours such as wing-flapping, feather ruffling, leg stretching and dust-bathing. Turkeys are highly social and become very distressed when isolated. Many of their behaviours are socially facilitated; i.e., expression of a behaviour by one animal increases the tendency for this behaviour to be performed by others. Adults can recognise &#x27;strangers&#x27; and placing any alien turkey into an established group will almost certainly result in that individual being attacked, sometimes fatally. Turkeys are highly vocal, and &#x27;social tension&#x27; within the group can be monitored by the birds&#x27; vocalisations. A high-pitched trill indicates the birds are becoming aggressive which can develop into intense sparring where opponents leap at each other with the large, sharp talons, and try to peck or grasp the head of each other. Aggression increases in frequency and severity as the birds mature.

Maturing males spend a considerable proportion of their time sexually displaying. This is very similar to that of the wild turkey and involves fanning the tail feathers, drooping the wings and erecting all body feathers, including the &#x27;beard&#x27; (a tuft of black, modified hair-like feathers on the centre of the breast). The skin of the head, neck and caruncles (fleshy nodules) becomes bright blue and red, and the snood (an erectile appendage on the forehead) elongates, the birds &#x27;sneeze&#x27; at regular intervals, followed by a rapid vibration of their tail feathers. Throughout, the birds strut slowly about, with the neck arched backward, their breasts thrust forward and emitting their characteristic &#x27;gobbling&#x27; call.

==Size and weight==

The domestic turkey is the eighth largest living bird species in terms of maximum mass at 39 kg (86 lbs). Due to their extreme size differences, domestic turkeys are semi-flightless, as younger or smaller specimens are still capable of short-distance flight, whereas the largest individuals are completely flightless and terrestrial.

==Turkey breeds==


* The Broad Breasted White is the commercial turkey of choice for large scale industrial turkey farms, and consequently is the most consumed variety of the bird. Usually the turkey to receive a &quot;presidential pardon&quot;, a U.S. custom, is a Broad Breasted White.
* The Broad Breasted Bronze is another commercially developed strain of table bird.
* The Standard Bronze looks much like the Broad Breasted Bronze, except that it is single breasted, and can naturally breed.
* The Bourbon Red turkey is a smaller, non-commercial breed with dark reddish feathers with white markings.
* Slate, or Blue Slate, turkeys are a very rare breed with gray-blue feathers.
* The Black (&quot;Spanish Black&quot;, &quot;Norfolk Black&quot;) has very dark plumage with a green sheen.
* The Narragansett Turkey is a popular heritage breed named after Narraganset Bay in New England.
* The Chocolate is a rarer heritage breed with markings similar to a Black Spanish, but light brown instead of black in color. Common in the Southern U.S. and France before the Civil War.
* The Beltsville Small White is a small heritage breed, whose development started in 1934. The breed was introduced in 1941 and was admitted to the APA Standard in 1951. Although slightly bigger and broader than the Midget White, both are often mislabeled.
* The Midget White is a smaller heritage breed.

==Commercial production==
In commercial production, breeder farms supply eggs to hatcheries. After 28 days of incubation, the hatched poults are sexed and delivered to the grow-out farms; hens are raised separately from toms because of different growth rates.

In the UK, it is common to rear chicks in the following way. Between one and seven days of age, chicks are placed into small circular brooding pens to ensure they encounter food and water. To encourage feeding, they may be kept under constant light for the first 48 hours. To assist thermoregulation, air temperature is maintained at for the first three days, then lowered by approximately 3 °C (5.4 °F) every two days to at 37 days of age, and infrared heaters are usually provided for the first few days. Whilst in the pens, feed is made widely accessible by scattering it on sheets of paper in addition to being available in feeders. After several days, the pens are removed, allowing the birds access to the entire rearing shed, which may contain tens of thousands of birds. The birds remain there for several weeks, after which they are transported to another unit.

The vast majority of turkeys are reared indoors in purpose-built or modified buildings of which there are many types. Some types have slatted walls to allow ventilation, but many have solid walls and no windows to allow artificial lighting manipulations to optimise production. The buildings can be very large (converted aircraft hangars are sometimes used) and may contain tens of thousands of birds as a single flock. The floor substrate is usually deep-litter, e.g. wood shavings, which relies upon the controlled build-up of a microbial flora requiring skilful management. Ambient temperatures for adult domestic turkeys are usually maintained between . High temperatures should be avoided because the high metabolic rate of turkeys (up to 69 W/bird) makes them susceptible to heat stress, exacerbated by high stocking densities. Commercial turkeys are kept under a variety of lighting schedules, e.g. continuous light, long photoperiods (23 h), or intermittent lighting, to encourage feeding and accelerate growth. Light intensity is usually low (e.g. less than one lux) to reduce feather pecking.

Rations generally include corn and soybean meal, with added vitamins and minerals, and is adjusted for protein, carbohydrate and fat based on the age and nutrient requirements. Hens are slaughtered at about 14–16 weeks and toms at about 18–20 weeks of age when they can weigh over compared to a mature male wild turkey which weighs approximately . 

===Welfare concerns===

Stocking density is an issue in the welfare of commercial turkeys and high densities are a major animal welfare concern. Permitted stocking densities for turkeys reared indoors vary according to geography and animal welfare farm assurance schemes. For example, in Germany, there is a voluntary maximum of 52 kg/m2 and 58 kg/m2 for males and females respectively. In the UK, the RSPCA Freedom Foods assurance scheme reduces permissible stocking density to 25 kg/m2 for turkeys reared indoors. Turkeys maintained at commercial stocking densities (8 birds/m2; 61 kg/m2) exhibit increased welfare problems such as increases in gait abnormalities, hip and foot lesions, and bird disturbances, and decreased bodyweight compared with lower stocking densities. Turkeys reared at 8 birds/m2 have a higher incidence of hip lesions and foot pad dermatitis than those reared at 6.5 or 5.0 birds/m2. Insufficient space may lead to an increased risk for injuries such as broken wings caused by hitting the pen walls or other turkeys during aggressive encounters and can also lead to heat stress. The problems of small space allowance are exacerbated by the major influence of social facilitation on the behaviour of turkeys. If turkeys are to feed, drink, dust-bathe, etc., simultaneously, then to avoid causing frustration, resources and space must be available in large quantities.

Lighting manipulations used to optimise production can compromise welfare. Long photoperiods combined with low light intensity can result in blindness from buphthalmia (distortions of the eye morphology) or retinal detachment.

Feather pecking occurs frequently amongst commercially reared turkeys and can begin at 1 day of age. This behaviour is considered to be re-directed foraging behaviour, caused by providing poultry with an impoverished foraging environment. To reduce feather pecking, turkeys are often beak-trimmed. Ultraviolet-reflective markings appear on young birds at the same time as feather pecking becomes targeted toward these areas, indicating a possible link. Commercially reared turkeys also perform head-pecking, which becomes more frequent as they sexually mature. When this occurs in small enclosures or environments with few opportunities to escape, the outcome is often fatal and rapid. Frequent monitoring is therefore essential, particularly of males approaching maturity. Injuries to the head receive considerable attention from other birds, and head-pecking often occurs after a relatively minor injury has been received during a fight or when a lying bird has been trodden upon and scratched by another. Individuals being re-introduced after separation are often immediately attacked again. Fatal head-pecking can occur even in small (10 birds), stable groups. Commercial turkeys are normally reared in single-sex flocks. If a male is inadvertently placed in a female flock, he may be aggressively victimised (hence the term &#x27;henpecked&#x27;). Females in male groups will be repeatedly mated, during which it is highly likely she will be injured from being trampled upon.

===Breeding and companies===
The dominant commercial breed is the Broad-Breasted Whites (similar to the &quot;White Holland&quot;, but a separate breed), which have been selected for size and amount of meat. Mature toms are too large to achieve natural fertilization without injuring the hens, so their semen is collected, and hens are inseminated artificially. Several hens can be inseminated from each collection, so fewer toms are needed. The eggs of some turkey breeds are able to develop without fertilization, in a process called parthenogenesis. Breeders&#x27; meat is too tough for roasting, and is mostly used to make processed meats.

===Waste products===
Approximately of poultry feathers are produced every year by the poultry industry. Most are ground into a protein source for ruminant animal feed, which are able to digest the protein keratin of which feathers are composed. Researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have patented a method of removing the stiff quill from the fibers which make up the feather. As this is a potential supply of natural fibers, research has been conducted at Philadelphia University&#x27;s School of Engineering and Textiles to determine textile applications for feather fibers. Turkey feather fibers have been blended with nylon and spun into yarn, and then used for knitting. The yarns were tested for strength while the fabrics were evaluated as insulation materials. In the case of the yarns, as the percentage of turkey feather fibers increased, the strength decreased. In fabric form, as the percentage of turkey feather fibers increased, the heat retention capability of the fabric increased. 

==Turkeys as food==

Approximately 620 million turkeys are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. Turkeys are traditionally eaten as the main course of Christmas feasts in much of the English-speaking world (stuffed turkey) since appearing in England in the 16th century, as well as for Thanksgiving in the United States and Canada. While eating turkey was once mainly restricted to special occasions such as these, turkey is now eaten year-round and forms a regular part of many diets.

Turkeys are sold sliced and ground, as well as &quot;whole&quot; in a manner similar to chicken with the head, feet, and feathers removed. Frozen whole turkeys remain popular. Sliced turkey is frequently used as a sandwich meat or served as cold cuts; in some cases, where recipes call for chicken, turkey can be used as a substitute. Additionally, ground turkey is frequently marketed as a healthy ground beef substitute. Without careful preparation, cooked turkey may end up less moist than other poultry meats, such as chicken or duck. The breast of the turkey can be dipped in breadcrumbs as an alternative to chicken nuggets.

Wild turkeys, while technically the same species as domestic turkeys, have a very different taste from farm-raised turkeys. In contrast to domestic turkeys, almost all wild turkey meat is &quot;dark&quot; (even the breast) and more intensely flavored. The flavor can also vary seasonally with changes in available forage, often leaving wild turkey meat with a gamier flavor in late summer due to the greater number of insects in its diet over the preceding months. Wild turkeys that have fed predominantly on grass and grain have a milder flavor. Older heritage breeds also differ in flavor.

Unlike chicken, duck, and quail eggs, turkey eggs are not commonly sold as food due to the high demand for whole turkeys and the lower output of turkey eggs as compared with other fowl. The value of a single turkey egg is estimated to be about US$3.50 on the open market, substantially more than a single carton of one dozen chicken eggs.

White turkey meat is often considered healthier than dark meat because of its lower fat content, but the nutritional differences are small. Although turkey is reputed to cause sleepiness, holiday dinners are commonly large meals served with carbohydrates, fats, and alcohol in a relaxed atmosphere, all of which are bigger contributors to post-meal sleepiness than the tryptophan in turkey.

===Cooking===

Both fresh and frozen turkeys are used for cooking; as with most foods, fresh turkeys are generally preferred, although they cost more. Around holiday seasons, high demand for fresh turkeys often makes them difficult to purchase without ordering in advance. For the frozen variety, the large size of the turkeys typically used for consumption makes defrosting them a major endeavor: a typically sized turkey will take several days to properly defrost.

Turkeys are usually baked or roasted in an oven for several hours, often while the cook prepares the remainder of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is brined before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is necessary because the dark meat requires a higher temperature to denature all of the myoglobin pigment than the white meat (which is very low in myoglobin), so that fully cooking the dark meat tends to dry out the breast. Brining makes it possible to fully cook the dark meat without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills prior to serving.

In some areas, particularly the American South, turkeys may also be deep fried in hot oil (often peanut oil) for 30 to 45 minutes by using a turkey fryer. Deep frying turkey has become something of a fad, with hazardous consequences for those unprepared to safely handle the large quantities of hot oil required.

==Turkey litter for fuel==
Although most commonly used as fertilizer, turkey litter (droppings mixed with bedding material, usually wood chips) has been used as a fuel source in electric power plants. One such plant in western Minnesota provided 55 megawatts of power using 500,000 tons of litter per year. The plant, known as Fibrominn, operated from 2007 to 2018, closing due to being unable to compete commercially with low-carbon sources of renewable energy.

<doc id="296929" wikidata="Q454692" url="?curid=296929" title="Sonny Boy Williamson II">
<text>Alex or Aleck Miller (originally Ford, possibly December 5, 1912 – May 24, 1965), known later in his career as Sonny Boy Williamson, was an American blues harmonica player, singer and songwriter. He was an early and influential blues harp stylist who recorded successfully in the 1950s and 1960s. Miller used various names, including Rice Miller and Little Boy Blue, before calling himself Sonny Boy Williamson, which was also the name of a popular Chicago blues singer and harmonica player. To distinguish the two, Miller has been referred to as Sonny Boy Williamson II.

He first recorded with Elmore James on &quot;Dust My Broom&quot;. Some of his popular songs include &quot;Don&#x27;t Start Me Talkin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Help Me&quot;, &quot;Checkin&#x27; Up on My Baby&quot;, and &quot;Bring It On Home&quot;. He toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival and recorded with English rock musicians, including the Yardbirds and Animals. &quot;Help Me&quot; became a blues standard, and many blues and rock artists have recorded his songs.

==Biography==
===Early days===
Miller&#x27;s date and place of birth are disputed. There are various opinions about his year of birth, five of which are 1897, 1899, 1908, 1909, and 1912. According to David Evans, professor of music and an ethnomusicologist at the University of Memphis, census records indicate that Miller was born in about 1912, being seven years old on February 2, 1920, the day of the census. Miller&#x27;s gravestone at Tutwiler, Mississippi, set up by record company owner Lillian McMurry twelve years after his death, gives his date of birth as March 11, 1908. In a spoken word performance called “The Story of Sonny Boy Williamson” that was later included in several compilations, Miller states that he was born in Glendora, Mississippi in 1897. According to researchers Bob Eagle and Eric S. LeBlanc, he was born in the small community of Money, near Greenwood, Mississippi, in 1912.

He lived and worked with his sharecropper stepfather, Jim Miller, whose last name he soon adopted, and mother, Millie Ford, until the early 1930s. Beginning in the 1930s, he traveled around Mississippi and Arkansas and encountered Big Joe Williams, Elmore James and Robert Lockwood Jr., also known as Robert Junior Lockwood, who would play guitar on his later Checker Records sides. He was also associated with Robert Johnson during this period. Miller developed his style and raffish stage persona during these years. Willie Dixon recalled seeing Lockwood and Miller playing for tips in Greenville, Mississippi, in the 1930s. He entertained audiences with novelties such as inserting one end of the harmonica into his mouth and playing with no hands. At this time he was often known as &quot;Rice&quot; Miller—a childhood nickname stemming from his love of rice and milk—or as &quot;Little Boy Blue&quot;.

In 1941 Miller was hired to play the &quot;King Biscuit Time&quot; show, advertising the King Biscuit brand of baking flour on radio station KFFA in Helena, Arkansas, with Lockwood. The program&#x27;s sponsor, Max Moore, began billing Miller as Sonny Boy Williamson, apparently in an attempt to capitalize on the fame of the well-known Chicago-based harmonica player and singer Sonny Boy Williamson (birth name John Lee Curtis Williamson, died 1948). Although John Lee Williamson was a major blues star who had already released dozens of successful and widely influential records under the name &quot;Sonny Boy Williamson&quot; from 1937 onward, Miller would later claim to have been the first to use the name. Some blues scholars believe that Miller&#x27;s assertion he was born in 1899 was a ruse to convince audiences he was old enough to have used the name before John Lee Williamson, who was born in 1914.

While in Clarksdale, Williamson stayed at the Riverside Hotel. A 13-year-old Ike Turner backed Williamson on piano during local gigs.

===Radio show in West Memphis===
In 1949, Williamson relocated to West Memphis, Arkansas, and lived with Howlin&#x27; Wolf. (Later, for Checker Records, he did a parody of Howlin&#x27; Wolf, entitled &quot;Like Wolf&quot;.) He started his own KWEM radio show from 1948 to 1950, selling the elixir Hadacol. He brought his King Biscuit musician friends to West Memphis—Elmore James, Houston Stackhouse, Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup, Robert Nighthawk, and others—to perform on KWEM radio. Williamson married Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s half-sister Maggy and he showed Wolf how to play harmonica.

===Recording career===
Williamson&#x27;s first recording session took place in 1951 for Lillian McMurry of Trumpet Records, based in Jackson, Mississippi. It was three years since the death of John Lee Williamson, which for the first time allowed some legitimacy to Miller&#x27;s carefully worded claim to being &quot;the one and only Sonny Boy Williamson&quot;. When Trumpet went bankrupt in 1955, Williamson&#x27;s recording contract was yielded to its creditors, who sold it to Chess Records in Chicago. He had begun developing a following in Chicago beginning in 1953, when he appeared there as a member of Elmore James&#x27;s band. During his Chess years he enjoyed his greatest success and acclaim, recording about 70 songs for the Chess subsidiary Checker Records from 1955 to 1964. His first LP record was a compilation of previously released singles. Titled &quot;Down and Out Blues&quot;, Checker released the collection in 1959. A single, &quot;Boppin&#x27; with Sonny&quot; backed with &quot;No Nights by Myself&quot;, was released by Ace Records in 1955.

In 1972, Chess released &quot;This Is My Story&quot;, a compilation album featuring Williamson&#x27;s recordings for the label. It was later included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;basic record library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981).

===1960s European tours===
In the early 1960s he toured Europe several times during the height of the British blues craze, backed on a number of occasions by the Authentics (see &quot;American Folk Blues Festival&quot;), recording with the Yardbirds (for the album &quot;Sonny Boy Williamson and the Yardbirds&quot;) and the Animals, and appearing on several television broadcasts throughout Europe. Around this time he was quoted as saying of the backing bands who accompanied him, &quot;those British boys want to play the blues real bad, and they do&quot;.

Sonny Boy took a liking to the European fans, and while there had a custom-made, two-tone suit tailored personally for him, along with a bowler hat, matching umbrella, and an attaché case for his harmonicas. He appears credited as &quot;Big Skol&quot; on Roland Kirk&#x27;s live album &quot;Kirk in Copenhagen&quot; (1963).

===Death===
Upon his return to the U.S., he resumed playing the King Biscuit Time show on KFFA, and performed in the Helena, Arkansas area. As fellow musicians Houston Stackhouse and Peck Curtis waited at the KFFA studios for Williamson on May 25, 1965, the 12:15 broadcast time was approaching and Williamson was nowhere in sight. Peck left the radio station to locate Williamson, and discovered his body in bed at the rooming house where he had been staying, dead of an apparent heart attack suffered in his sleep the night before. Williamson is buried on New Africa Road, just outside Tutwiler, Mississippi at the site of the former Whitman Chapel cemetery. Trumpet Records owner McMurry provided the headstone with an incorrect date of death.

==Naming==
The recordings made by John Lee Williamson between 1937 and his death in 1948 and those made between 1951 and 1964 by &quot;Rice&quot; Miller were all originally issued under the name Sonny Boy Williamson. It is believed that Miller adopted the name to suggest to audiences (and to his first record label) that he was the &quot;original&quot; Sonny Boy. To differentiate between the two musicians, scholars and biographers have referred to John Lee Williamson (1914–1948) as &quot;Sonny Boy Williamson I&quot; or &quot;the original Sonny Boy&quot; and to Miller (circa 1912–1965) as &quot;Sonny Boy Williamson II&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In 2014, Williamson was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Helena, Arkansas.

<text>Maxwell Sieben Baucus ( Enke; born December 11, 1941) is an American politician who served as a United States senator from Montana from 1978 to 2014. A member of the Democratic Party, he was a U.S. senator for over 35 years, making him the longest-serving U.S. senator in Montana history. President Barack Obama later appointed Baucus to replace Gary Locke as the 11th U.S. Ambassador to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a position he held from 2014 until 2017.

As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, Baucus played an influential role in the debate over health care reform in the United States. He was also chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation, a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and was chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Before his election to the Senate, Baucus was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1975 to 1978, representing Montana&#x27;s 1st congressional district. He previously served in the Montana House of Representatives from 1973 to 1974. His career included charges of conflicts of interest due to his ties to the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, and his nomination of his girlfriend to be a US Attorney.

==Early life and education==
Maxwell Sieben Enke was born on December 11, 1941, in Helena, Montana, to historian and rancher Jean Sheriff (1917–2011) and Stephen Enke (1916–1974), a demographer and economist. His father, born in British Columbia, Canada, was of German and Scottish descent, and his mother had English and German ancestry. Baucus lived in Los Angeles, California, until he was two, when his mother left his father and returned to Helena.

His mother later married John J. Baucus, and she and her son, Max, took his surname. Baucus graduated from Helena High School in 1959.

After attending local public schools in his hometown of Helena, he attended Carleton College in Minnesota for a year. He then transferred to Stanford University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics in 1964, and was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. After graduating, he attended Stanford Law School and graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1967.

== Early career ==
After finishing law school, Baucus spent two years working as a staff attorney for the Civil Aeronautics Board and then two years as a lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C. He moved back to his native Montana in 1971 to serve as the executive director of the state&#x27;s Constitutional Convention, opening a law office in Missoula, Montana. In November 1972, Baucus was elected to the Montana House of Representatives as a state representative from Missoula. In November 1974 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, and he was re-elected in 1976.

==U.S. Senate==
Baucus was elected to the U.S. Senate on November 7, 1978, for the term beginning January 3, 1979, but was subsequently appointed to the seat by Montana&#x27;s Democratic Governor Thomas Lee Judge on December 15, 1978, to fill the brief vacancy created by Senator Paul G. Hatfield&#x27;s resignation. On April 23, 2013, a Democratic official confirmed that Baucus would not seek a seventh term.

===Committee assignments===

* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry
** Subcommittee on Domestic and Foreign Marketing, Inspection, and Plant and Animal Health
** Subcommittee on Production, Income Protection and Price Support
** Subcommittee on Hunger, Nutrition and Family Farms
* Committee on Finance (Chairman)
** As Chairman of the full committee, Baucus may serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees of which he is not already a full member.
** Subcommittee on Taxation, IRS Oversight, and Long-term Growth
** Subcommittee on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth
* Committee on Environment and Public Works
** Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety
** Subcommittee on Superfund, Toxics and Environmental Health
** Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure (Chairman)
* Joint Committee on Taxation (Chairman)
* Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction

==Political positions==

As a Democratic member of the Senate, Baucus was conservative, and frequently broke with his party on the issues of taxes, the environment, health care, and gun control. The web site That&#x27;s My Congress gives him a 23 percent rating on progressive issues it tracks. NARAL Pro-Choice America&#x27;s political action committee endorsed Baucus during his 2008 election campaign.

===Civil rights===

The American Civil Liberties Union rated Baucus at 60 percent in December 2002, indicating a mixed civil rights voting record.

====LGBT rights====

In 2006, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) gave Baucus a 67% overall rating indicating having a mixed record on voting for gay rights. In 1996 Baucus voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) which prohibited &quot;marriage between members of the same sex in federal law, and provide that no state is required to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states&quot; and defined marriage as being between a single man and a single woman. However, in 2004 he voted against the proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and in June 2012, he definitively spoke out in support for same-sex marriage. He has supported measures to curb job discrimination and hate crimes based on sexual orientation. He voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.

====Tobacco tax extension====

In 2012, Baucus added to a transportation bill in Congress that extended the regulations covering cigarette manufacturers to &quot;roll your own cigarette&quot; stores that operate mass cigarette rolling machines.

====Voting rights for Washington, D.C.====

Baucus voted against giving voting representation to the District of Columbia.

===Economic issues===

Baucus has a 74% pro-business voting record as rated by the United States Chamber of Commerce. He twice voted to make filing bankruptcy more difficult for debtors, once in July 2001 to restrict rules on personal bankruptcy, and a second time in March 2005 to include means-testing and restrictions for bankruptcy filers. He has frequently visited places of employment within the state and has personally participated in activities that he calls &quot;Work Days&quot;.

Baucus voted for the Bush tax cuts in 2001. He has usually voted against repealing portions of that bill and against repealing more recent tax cut bills that benefit upper income taxpayers. In 2008, he voted in favor of permanently repealing the estate tax.

In March 2005, Baucus voted against repealing tax subsidies benefiting companies that outsource U.S. jobs offshore. On January 4, 2007, he wrote an editorial in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; calling on Democrats to renew President George W. Bush&#x27;s fast-track authority for international trade deals. In response, the Montana State Senate passed a resolution, 44-6, &quot;that the U.S. Congress be urged to create a replacement for the outdated fast track system&quot;.

On October 27, 2009, he introduced the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2009 to Congress together with Representative Charles Rangel.

On August 9, 2011, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid appointed Baucus to the United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.

===Environmental issues===

Baucus&#x27;s environmental record in Congress was mixed. He supported Democratic leadership in voting against oil and gas subsidies and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling, as well as by voting in favor of national standards to reduce oil consumption and spur the use of hydrogen-powered cars. But he voted against the corporate average fuel economy standards (CAFE) and on increasing federal funds for solar and wind power. He was a leader in the massive Montana Legacy Project conservation project. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) gave Baucus a 79% rating for 2012; Baucus&#x27;s lifetime LCV rating is 68%. 

===Foreign affairs===
====Cuba====

As a senator, Baucus opposed the United States embargo against Cuba and travel restrictions.

====Iraq War====

Baucus voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. He voted with a majority of Democrats against Senator John Kerry&#x27;s amendment stipulating a firm deadline for withdrawal of American combat personnel from Iraq.

On July 29, 2006, Baucus&#x27;s nephew Marine Cpl. Phillip E. Baucus was killed in combat in Al Anbar Governorate. Phillip, a 28-year-old resident of Wolf Creek, Montana, had been a member of the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force.

On January 10, 2007, the day of President Bush&#x27;s address on his plan to increase troop levels in Iraq, Baucus spoke against the increases and called for a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops.

====Israel====

Baucus was one of the Senate&#x27;s largest career recipients of pro-Israel Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions, receiving $550,589 since 1989.

====Japan====

Baucus went on a trade mission in Japan, inspecting the Tesla Motors facility in Tokyo, saying &quot;Tesla is a great example of how exports and trade help the U.S. economy and create good-paying jobs at home in America. Our trade ties overseas help Tesla sell a world-class product that&#x27;s manufactured in the U.S. by top-notch American workers,&quot; Baucus said. &quot;There are millions of consumers in Japan and across the Pacific ready to buy more American-made goods, and we can continue to open those markets and boost U.S. exports with an aggressive trade agenda.&quot;

====Vietnam====

On July 14, 2009, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published an editorial on Baucus&#x27;s attitude over Vietnam&#x27;s &quot;tra&quot; and &quot;basa&quot; pangasius, saying there was no reason for America to launch a trade war with Vietnam over fish. &quot;He&#x27;s dead right about a trade issue now percolating in Washington,&quot; said the newspaper. The article, entitled &quot;Max Baucus&#x27;s Fish SenseProtectionism often hurts the protectionist&quot;, outlined this controversial topic in Washington and underlined the possibility that the U.S. Department of Agriculture could effectively ban imports from Vietnam of pangasius fish, which are similar to U.S.-produced catfish.

The ostensible reason for the move would be food safety and the USDA is considering whether Vietnamese fish should be subject to a stricter safety inspection regime. But the article noted that there have been no reported cases of Vietnamese fish making American consumers sick and the proposed inspections would be onerous. It quoted Baucus as telling &quot;Congress Daily&quot;, &quot;If we expect other countries to follow the rules and drop these restrictions, it is critical that we play by the rules and do not block imports for arbitrary or unscientific reasons.&quot;

===Gun policy===

In 1994, Baucus cast a pivotal vote in favor of Senator Dianne Feinstein&#x27;s (D-CA) &quot;Assault Weapons&quot; Ban. In 2013, Baucus was one of four Democrats to vote against the Manchin-Toomey Amendment to expand background checks for potential gun buyers. He is an avid hunter.

In 1999, Baucus was the only Democrat to vote against an amendment by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) that sought to &quot;regulate the sale of firearms at gun shows&quot;— after the Columbine High School massacre.

In 2014, he cast one of only four Democratic votes against universal gun show background checks. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee ran ads in Montana saying: &quot;Senator Baucus, it was WRONG to vote &#x27;no&#x27; on stopping gun violence. 79% of Montana voters support background checks. Stand with us, not gun manufacturers.&quot; The group planned to spend money to unseat Baucus over his vote on gun control in the 2014 election, but he chose not to seek reelection.

===Health care reform===

In 2013, Baucus was criticized for his comments concerning the implementation of Obamacare provisions specifically stating it could turn into a &quot;train-wreck&quot;. He feared that the changes and their specific implementations would have a negative impact on small business owners stating &quot;When I am home, small businesses have no idea what to do, what to expect. They don&#x27;t know what affordability rules are; they don&#x27;t know when penalties may apply. They just don&#x27;t know. While Baucus was very supportive of the intent of the new legislation saying &quot;I spent two years of my life working on the Affordable Care Act. There is nothing I want more than for it to succeed,&quot; he was very critical of the resulting rollout.

====Senate finance committee====

As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Baucus called the first Senate meeting of interested parties before the committee to discuss health care reform, including representatives from pharmaceutical groups, insurance companies, and HMOs and hospital management companies. Some viewed the meeting as controversial because it did not include representatives from groups calling for single-payer health care.

====Opposition to single payer health care====

Advocate groups attended a Senate Finance Committee meeting in May 2009 to protest their exclusion as well as statements by Baucus that &quot;single payer was not an option on the table.&quot; Baucus later had eight protesters removed by police who arrested them for disrupting the hearing. Many of the single-payer advocates said it was a &quot;pay to play&quot; event. A representative of the Business Roundtable, which includes 35 memberships of health maintenance organizations, health insurance and pharmaceutical companies, admitted that other countries, with lower health costs, and higher quality of care, such as those with single-payer systems, have a competitive advantage over the United States with its private system.

At the next meeting on health care reform of the Senate Finance Committee, Baucus had five more doctors and nurses removed and arrested. Baucus admitted a few weeks later in June 2009 that it was a mistake to rule out a single payer plan because doing so alienated a large, vocal constituency and left President Barack Obama&#x27;s proposal of a public health plan to compete with private insurers as the most liberal position. Obama expressed deep frustration with Baucus regarding negotiations over the Affordable Care Act saying &quot;A part of me wanted to get up, grab Baucus by the shoulders, and shake him till he came to his senses.&quot;

Baucus has used the term &quot;uniquely American solution&quot; to describe the end point of current health reform and has said he believes America is not ready yet for any form of single payer health care. This is the same term the insurance trade association, America&#x27;s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), is using. AHIP has launched the Campaign for an American Solution, which argues for the use of private health insurance instead of a government backed program. Critics have said Medicare is already effectively a single-payer system.

Years after his departure from the Senate, Baucus said it would make sense to seriously consider a single-payer system.

==Conflicts of interest==
===Ties to health insurance and pharmaceutical industries===
Baucus has been criticized for his ties to the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries, and was one of the greatest beneficiaries in the Senate of campaign contributions from these industries. From 2003-08, Baucus received $3,973,485 from the health sector, including $852,813 from pharmaceutical companies, $851,141 from health professionals, $784,185 from the insurance industry. and $465,750 from HMOs/health services, according to OpenSecrets. A 2006 study by Public Citizen found that between 1999 and 2005 Baucus, along with former Senate majority leader Bill Frist, took in the most special-interest money of any senator.

Only three senators have more former staffers working as lobbyists on K Street, at least two dozen in Baucus&#x27;s case. Several of Baucus&#x27;s ex-staffers, including former chief of staff David Castagnetti, are now working for the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries. Castagnetti co-founded the lobbying firm of Mehlman Vogel Castagnetti, which represents &quot;America&#x27;s Health Insurance Plans Inc&quot;, the national trade group of health insurance companies, the Medicare Cost Contractors Alliance, as well as Amgen, AstraZeneca, and Merck &amp; Company. Another former chief of staff, Jeff Forbes, opened his own lobbying shop and to represent the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Advanced Medical Technology Association, among other groups. 

A statistical analysis of the impact of political contributions on individual senators&#x27; support for the public insurance option conducted by Nate Silver has suggested that Baucus was an unlikely supporter of the public option in the first place. Based on Baucus&#x27;s political ideology and the per capita health care spending in Montana, Silver&#x27;s model projects that there would be only a 30.6% probability of Baucus supporting a public insurance option even if he had received no relevant campaign contributions. Silver calculates that the impact on Baucus of the significant campaign contributions that he has received from the health care industry further reduces the probability of his supporting a public insurance option from 30.6% to 0.6%.

In response to the questions raised by the large amount of funding he took from the health care industry, Baucus declared a moratorium as of July 1, 2009 on taking more special interest money from health care political action committees. Baucus, however, refused to return as part of his moratorium any of the millions of dollars he has received from health care industry interests before July 1, 2009, or to rule out a resumption of taking the same or greater health care industry contributions in the future. His policy on not taking health care industry money reportedly still allowed him to accept money from lobbyists or corporate executives, who, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, continued to make donations after July 1, 2009.

A watchdog group found that in July 2009 Baucus accepted additional money from the health care industry in violation of his own self-defined moratorium terms, reportedly leading Baucus to return those monies.

In 2013, journalist Jonathan Cohn wrote in &quot;The New Republic&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s not a huge exaggeration to say Baucus&#x27;s career represents everything that is wrong with Washington.&quot; That year &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that 28 former Baucus staffers had lobbied on tax issues during the Obama administration — the most of any member of Congress, and that on a regular basis Baucus would fly lobbyists to his ranch for weekend fundraisers.

===Nomination of girlfriend for US Attorney===
In 2008, Baucus, while he was still married to his second wife, nominated his girlfriend and state office director, Melodee Hanes, to the vacant position of U.S. Attorney for Montana. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that according to several people he did not mention his relationship to the White House or to the attorney who tasked with reviewing candidates when he made the recommendation. Hanes then withdrew her nomination before the conflict of interest was discovered, because (according to Baucus) they wanted to be together in Washington, D.C. Both the Senator and Hanes had ended their marriages within the previous year; Hanes had met with the divorce lawyer of Baucus in 2007 at least twice, to discuss how the senator&#x27;s work would be affected if he were to divorce his wife. Baucus said he was separated from his wife before he began seeing Hanes. Critics questioned whether he had misused his power to promote his lover and former aide. Marc Ambinder of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote: &quot;That Baucus would ignore the conflict of the interest or so easily dismiss it calls into question his judgment and his ethics. That&#x27;s a scandal.&quot;

==Political campaigns==
===2002===

The 2002 Montana elections got national attention when Baucus&#x27;s opponent, state senator Mike Taylor, accused Baucus of having implied in a campaign ad that Taylor was gay. The ad was paid for by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, not by the Baucus campaign. The ad, which alleged that Taylor had embezzled funds from the cosmetology school he once owned, showed footage from the early 1980s of Taylor massaging another man&#x27;s face while wearing a tight suit with an open shirt. Taylor dropped out of the race and Baucus won with 63 percent of the vote.

===2008===

Baucus sought re-election in 2008 in Montana, a state that has seen political change starting in 2004 when it elected Democratic Governor Brian Schweitzer and then in 2006 Democratic Senator Jon Tester by a slim margin. Montana was the only state in the U.S. to turn over a chamber of its legislature to Republican control in 2006. The legislative chamber had a one-seat Democratic majority that then became a one-seat Republican majority.

Baucus raised a record amount of money for his 2008 re-election bid, 91 percent of which came from individuals living outside of Montana. Similarly, according to OpenSecrets, Baucus&#x27;s 2008 campaign raised $11.6million, only 13 percent of which came from Montana donors; the rest included millions from health care and other industries overseen by Finance and Baucus&#x27;s other committees.
So as Baucus and other lawmakers attempt to craft a bill that can smash through a virtual gridlock of interests, the awkward question lingers: to whom are they more attentive, their voting constituencies back home or the dollar constituencies who are at the Capitol every day?

As a result of Baucus&#x27;s significant fund-raising advantage, in the week he announced his intention to run for re-election he opened eight state officesone more than he had official offices in the state. Baucus also announced that he had hired 35 full-time campaign staff members. Baucus won re-election in a landslide victory, with 73% of the vote, carrying every county in the state.

==U.S. Ambassador to China==
On December 20, 2013, President Obama announced his intent to nominate Baucus to the post of Ambassador to China. He submitted Baucus&#x27;s nomination to the Senate on January 7, 2014.

A hearing on the nomination was held by the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on January 28, 2014. His nomination was reported to the full Senate on February 4, 2014. He was confirmed by the full Senate on February 6, 2014 by a vote of 96–0 and Baucus himself voting &quot;Present&quot;. Baucus was sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden on February 21, 2014; ending the ambassadorship of Gary Locke. Baucus cannot speak Mandarin Chinese, which was historically unusual for this position.

Baucus ended his ambassadorship in January 2017, as President Donald Trump nominated Governor Terry Branstad from Iowa to serve as the next Ambassador to China.

==Later career==
Baucus served on the Board of Advisors to Alibaba Group until May 2019.

==Electoral history==




==Personal life==

Baucus has one son by his first wife, Ann Geracimos. Baucus and Geracimos divorced in 1982.

Baucus came under fire from critics calling him a beltway insider who no longer really lived in Montana and only occasionally came to visit. Until 1991, Baucus owned a house in Missoula, where he practiced law for three years before running for Congress in 1974. He didn&#x27;t own a home again in Montana until February 2002, when he bought half of his mother&#x27;s house from the ranch started by Baucus&#x27;s great-grandfather in 1897.

In April 2009, the Associated Press reported that Baucus and his second wife, the former Wanda Minge, were divorcing after 25 years of marriage and had &quot;parted ways amicably and with mutual respect&quot;.

On July 2, 2011, Baucus married girlfriend and former office manager Hanes at the Sieben Ranch in Montana.

Baucus has completed a 50-mile ultramarathon and has crewed for winner and Vermont native Nikki Kimball at the 100-mile Western States Endurance Run, which he hoped to run in the future.

<text>Brad H. Gerstenfeld (born April 14, 1960), known professionally as Brad Garrett, is an American actor and stand-up comedian.

Garrett was initially successful as a stand-up comedian in the early 1980s. Taking advantage of that success in the late 1980s, Garrett began appearing in television and film, in minor and guest roles. His first major role was Robert Barone on the CBS sitcom &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. The series debuted September 13, 1996, and ran for nine seasons. In 2002, he gave an Emmy-nominated and critically lauded performance as Jackie Gleason in the television film &quot;Gleason&quot;.

Garrett also played the leading role of Eddie Stark on the Fox sitcom &quot;&#x27;Til Death&quot; from 2006 to 2010. From 2006 to 2014, he played the Easter Island Head in the &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; trilogy. From 2018 to 2020, he starred in the ABC sitcom &quot;Single Parents&quot;. In 2021, Garrett also helped create Disney+&#x27;s &quot;Big Shot&quot; with David E. Kelley and Dean Lorey. He is also known for voicing the Big Dog on &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;.

Garrett has won three Primetime Emmy Awards, with three other nominations. He is still prominent within stand-up comedy and owns a comedy club at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, called Brad Garrett&#x27;s Comedy Club, where he performs regularly.

==Early life==
Garrett was born Brad H. Gerstenfeld on April 14, 1960, to Barbara and Alvin &quot;Al&quot; Gerstenfeld in Oxnard, California. He is Jewish. Garrett has two brothers, Jeff and Paul. He attended George Ellery Hale Middle School and graduated from El Camino Real High School, both in the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles, California. Garrett attended UCLA for less than two months before dropping out to pursue his comedy career.

==Career==

Before comedy Garrett was known for being on the rear cover of ELO&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Discovery&quot;. In the early 1980s, he started doing standup at various comedy clubs in Los Angeles, including The Improv in Hollywood and The Ice House in Pasadena. In 1984, he became the first $100,000 grand champion winner in the comedy category of the TV show &quot;Star Search&quot;. This led to his first appearance, at age 23, on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, making him one of the youngest comedians ever to perform on the show. His appearance with Carson brought Garrett more national attention, and soon he was appearing as an opening act for such headliners as Diana Ross and Liza Minnelli. He also opened in Las Vegas for Frank Sinatra, David Copperfield, Smokey Robinson, Sammy Davis Jr., the Beach Boys, The Righteous Brothers and Julio Iglesias.

After achieving a strong measure of success with stand-up comedy, Garrett began performing on TV. From 1985 to 1986, he was the voice of Hulk Hogan (in a voice similar to Rodney Dangerfield) for the cartoon series &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n Wrestling&quot;. He was featured on &quot;Family Feud&quot; during Ray Combs&#x27;s tenure in a &quot;Funny Men vs. Funny Women Week&quot; during November sweeps. He also appeared for a week on the game show &quot;Super Password&quot; in 1987. He also appeared on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; including a moment when he impersonated Bill Cosby during a question about Jell-o. He then appeared in the short-lived summer comedy &quot;First Impressions&quot; (CBS, 1988), in which he was a divorced father who makes a living doing impressions, in a one-time spot as a bank loan officer on &quot;Roseanne&quot; (ABC), and &quot;The Pursuit of Happiness&quot; (NBC, 1995–96), in which he was the hero&#x27;s gay best friend. Prior to these roles, Garrett had also had a minor part on &quot;Transformers&quot;, voicing the Decepticon base Trypticon in season three and as an ill-fated thug in &quot;Suicide Kings&quot;. He soon won the role of Ray Romano&#x27;s brother Robert Barone on the family-oriented comedy &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, and in 1998, he and Romano appeared together in their respective roles on a Season 1 episode of &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, titled &quot;Road Rayge&quot;, in which Robert is jealous of his brother spending so much time with Doug Heffernan (the main character played by Kevin James). Garrett has also made an appearance on &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; playing a hitman who attempts to kill Will Smith&#x27;s character.
Garrett also works as a voice actor, such as on &quot;Mighty Ducks: The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;, &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;, &quot;The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper&quot;, &quot;Project Geeker&quot;, &quot;Biker Mice from Mars&quot;, &quot;Toonsylvania&quot;, &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;Finding Dory&quot;, &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, &quot;Asterix and the Vikings&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Justice League&quot; as Lobo.

His role on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; won him five Emmy Award nominations, and the 2002, 2003 and 2005 Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.

In 1990, Garrett appeared as a semi-regular panelist on the revival of &quot;Match Game&quot;. On the May 2, 1996, episode of the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, called &quot;The Bottle Deposit&quot;, Garrett played a rogue auto mechanic who steals Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s car.

In 2003, he was also nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie for &quot;Gleason&quot;. With his &quot;Raymond&quot; castmates, he won the 2003 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. He won the fifth season championship of &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot;, and played in the 2005, 2006 and 2007 World Series of Poker. Garrett was hoping to do a spin-off with his character Robert Barone from &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; when the show ended its nine-year run in 2005, but he withdrew in October 2005 due to inaction from CBS that led to a number of the writers from &quot;Raymond&quot; leaving and taking other jobs.

In 2005, Garrett appeared on Broadway playing Murray the Cop in the revival of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. He understudied Lane in the role of Oscar Madison, and substituted for him in January 2006, during Lane&#x27;s illness. That same year, he starred in &quot;The Pacifier&quot; opposite Vin Diesel. In 2006, Fox announced they would pick up a new sitcom called &quot;&#x27;Til Death&quot; starring Garrett in the lead role. The plot revolves around a long married couple whose new next door neighbors are a pair of feisty newlyweds. Joely Fisher plays Garrett&#x27;s wife in the series. He also appeared onstage on &quot;American Idol&quot; season six (2007) during judging on week 11, to which Ryan Seacrest said, &quot;And the next person off &quot;American Idol&quot; is—Brad, you&#x27;re out.&quot;

In the fall of 2008, Garrett starred in, and was the executive producer for, an online reality show called &quot;Dating Brad Garrett&quot;. In 2008, Garrett hosted a celebrity roast of Cheech &amp; Chong, which was aired on TBS.

In 2009, Garrett entered the main event at the World Series of Poker, losing on the second day of the event. Garrett has starred in commercials for 7-Up, where he portrays a more happy, cheerful version of himself because of the soda.

In June 2010, he opened Brad Garrett&#x27;s Comedy Club in the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. In December 2010, he was one of the narrators during performances of the Candlelight Processional at Epcot.

In June 2011, &quot;I Kid with Brad Garrett&quot;, a candid kids show, premiered on TLC. On December 12, 2011, Garrett closed his club at the Tropicana. He started a new club with the same name across the street at the MGM Grand, and is active as of April 2016.

In the summer of 2013, Garrett played Chug in the film &quot;Planes&quot;, marking the fourth time he starred in a film with John Ratzenberger. In the fall of 2013, Garrett played a recurring character in &quot;The Crazy Ones&quot;. In May 2016, he was confirmed to appear as the voice of Krang, in the sci-fi action comedy film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;.

In November 2016, Garrett portrayed Frankenstein&#x27;s monster in a Christmas commercial for Apple&#x27;s iPhone 7. As of 2017, the ad has received over seven million views. 

In 2018, Garrett voiced the character Eeyore in the live-action film &quot;Christopher Robin&quot;, based on Disney&#x27;s &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; franchise, and in a cameo in the animated film &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;. He previously voiced the character in the 1995 video game &quot;Disney&#x27;s Animated Storybook: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot;.

As of 2021, he portrays a character named Tony Bolognavich in Jimmy Johns&#x27;s commercials.

When asked whether he would do a revival of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, he stated:There&#x27;s no show without the parents. That&#x27;s really the bottom line. Doris and Peter were such a huge part of the show. I miss them but some things you don&#x27;t go back to, you know. We could never recreate that.

==Personal life==

In 1998, Garrett proposed to his then-girlfriend, Jill Diven, on the set of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, and they were married on May 18, 1999; together they have two children, a son and a daughter. Garrett and Diven separated in 2005, and Diven filed for divorce in July 2006. The divorce was finalized in November 2007.

In 2008, he began dating actress IsaBeall Quella, whom he met at a Vose art gallery in Boston. They were engaged in December 2015. The couple married on November 11, 2021.

Garrett stated in an interview in May 2015, that as his acting career began, he won a battle against alcoholism, later admitting he was a &quot;high-functioning alcoholic&quot;.

<text>The golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus), also known as the Chinese pheasant, and rainbow pheasant, is a gamebird of the order Galliformes (gallinaceous birds) and the family Phasianidae (pheasants). The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;khrusolophos&quot;, &quot;with golden crest&quot;, and &quot;pictus&quot; is Latin for &quot;painted&quot; from &quot;pingere&quot;, &quot;to paint&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The golden pheasant was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Phasianus pictus&quot;. He specified the type location as China. The specific epithet &quot;pictus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;painted&quot;. The golden pheasant is now placed with Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasant in the genus &quot;Chrysolophus&quot; that was introduced in 1834 by the English zoologist John Edward Gray.

==Description==
The adult male is approximately in length, with its tail accounting for two-thirds of the total length, and around in weight. Its coloration is characterized by a golden crest and rump and by a bright red body. It possess an orange ruff or &quot;cape&quot; on the back that can be spread in display, appearing as an alternating black and orange fan that covers all of the face except for the eyes. The eye is bright yellow, with a pinpoint black pupil. The face, throat, chin, and the sides of neck are rusty tan. The wattles and orbital skin are both yellow. The upper back is green and the rest of the back and rump is golden-yellow. The tertiary feathers on the wings are blue, whereas the scapulars are dark red. The central tail feathers are black spotted with cinnamon, while the tip of the tail is a cinnamon buff. The upper tail coverts are the same colour as the central tail feathers. The male also has a scarlet breast, and scarlet and light chestnut flanks and underparts. Lower legs and feet are a dull yellow.

The adult female (hen) is in length and weights around . Her tail is proportionally longer, and makes up roughly half of her total length. She is much less showy than the male, with a duller mottled brown plumage similar to that of the female common pheasant, but is darker and more slender. The female&#x27;s breast and sides are barred buff and blackish brown, and the abdomen is plain buff. She has a buff face and throat. Some abnormal females may later in their lifetime develop some male plumage. Both males and females have yellow legs and yellow bills.

==Distribution and habitat==
The golden pheasant is native to forests in mountainous areas of western China, but feral populations have been established in the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, the Falkland Islands, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. In England they may be found in East Anglia in the dense forest landscape of the Breckland as well as Tresco on the Isles of Scilly.

Golden pheasants were introduced to Maui, in Hawaii, at some point before their first detection in 1996. The original birds were released in The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s Waikamoi Preserve, where the founder population has showed evidence of reproductive behavior. Secondary groups were later recorded in Hanawï Natural Area Reserve and Haleakalä National Park, where they most probably arrived through dispersal from Waikamoi. Overall, the pheasants inhabit areas between on the windward slope of the island.

==Ecology==
Golden pheasants feed on the ground on grain, leaves and invertebrates, but they roost in trees at night. During winter, flocks tend to forage close to human settlements at the edge of forest, taking primarily wheat leaves and seeds. While they can fly clumsily in short bursts, they prefer to run and spend most of their time on the ground. This type of flying is commonly known as &quot;flapping flight&quot; and is due to a lack of a deep layer of M. pectoralis pars thoracicus and the tendon that attaches to it. This muscle is commonly attributed to the stabilization of flight in other birds; however, the absence of this deep layer causes this mode of &quot;flapping flight&quot; is simply a mechanism that it shares with other ground birds in order to escape predators. However, they would rather prefer to simply run away and hide from their predators rather than to fly.

Golden pheasants lay 8 to 12 eggs at a time and will then incubate these for around 22–23 days. They tend to eat berries, grubs, seeds and other types of vegetation.

The male has a metallic call in the breeding season.

==In captivity==
The golden pheasant is commonly found in zoos and aviaries, but often as hybrid specimens that have the similar Lady Amherst&#x27;s pheasant in their lineage.

There are also different mutations of the golden pheasant known from birds in captivity, including the dark-throated, yellow, cinnamon, salmon, peach, splash, mahogany and silver. In aviculture, the wild type is referred to as &quot;red-golden&quot; to differentiate it from these mutations.

The coloration in the feathers can be an indication to the genetic quality of the male golden pheasant. Hue, brightness, and chroma are usually measured to see color differences. results show that heterozygosity of the most polymorphic major histocompatibility complex locus was highly related with the chroma and brightness of the feathers.

<doc id="296939" wikidata="Q1927918" url="?curid=296939" title="Michael Huffington">
<text>Roy Michael Huffington Jr. (born September 3, 1947) is an American politician, LGBT activist, and film producer. He was a member of the Republican Party, and a congressman for one term, 1993–1995, from California. Huffington was married to Arianna Huffington, the Greek-born co-founder of &quot;HuffPost&quot;, from 1986 to 1997.

== Early years ==
Huffington was born in Dallas, Texas, to Celeste Phyllis (Gough) and Roy Michael Huffington, the founder of the natural gas exploration company, Roy M. Huffington, Inc. (HUFFCO).

In 1965, Huffington graduated from Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana, where he received the Central States Amateur Rowing Association Medal when he rowed on the light weight crew. After graduation, he was elected to the Culver Chapter of the Cum Laude Society. In 1970, he received a BS degree in engineering and a BA degree in economics concurrently from Stanford University. Huffington was a member of the varsity crew, student senator, and co-president of his senior class. In 1972, he received an MBA in finance from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Huffington&#x27;s wealth is derived from a merchant bank he started and his share of the family&#x27;s Houston oil, gas and real estate firm that was sold to Taiwan interests in 1990. His father, Roy M. Huffington, made a fortune through natural gas interests in Indonesia.

== Politics ==
Huffington&#x27;s interest in politics began in 1968, when he was a summer intern in Washington, D.C. for freshman Congressman George H. W. Bush.

In 1986, President Ronald Reagan appointed Huffington as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Negotiations Policy, with responsibility for conventional arms control negotiations. He was awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service.

In 1992, Huffington was elected to the House of Representatives from California&#x27;s 22nd District (Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties). He spent a record $5.4 million on his campaign, 95% of it his own money. He spent about $3.5 million in the Republican primary, in which he defeated veteran incumbent Robert J. Lagomarsino. Huffington later defeated then-Santa Barbara County Supervisor Gloria Ochoa in the general election. He donated his entire congressional salary to the Partnership for Children of Santa Barbara County in 1993, and to the Partnership for Children of San Luis Obispo County in 1994.

In 1994, Huffington did not seek re-election to the House but spent $28 million in a bid for the seat in the United States Senate held by Dianne Feinstein. She had won the seat in a special election two years earlier against John F. Seymour, who had been appointed in 1991 to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Governor-elect Pete Wilson. In the Republican primary, Huffington defeated William E. Dannemeyer. At the time, Huffington&#x27;s campaign was the most expensive in a non-presidential election in American history. He lost to Feinstein in the general election by 1.9 percent of the vote.

During 1998, Huffington was co-chairman (with actor and director Rob Reiner) of Proposition 10 in California, which increased the state excise tax on cigarettes by 50 cents per pack. The resulting multi-hundred million dollars of tax revenue was used for prenatal care and for the health care and education of children under six years of age.

In the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, Huffington endorsed Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. His ex-wife, Arianna Huffington, was an opposing candidate. She withdrew before the election, although her name remained on the ballot.

On June 29, 2006, Huffington co-chaired the Log Cabin Republicans &quot;The Courage To Lead: An Evening With The Governor&quot; dinner that honored California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Huffington also personally contributed $1 for every $2 contributed to the Log Cabin Republicans (a 501(c)(4) tax designated organization) for that dinner.

In 2006, Huffington became the director of It&#x27;s My Party Too, a group founded by former New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman. A moderate Republican organization with libertarian leanings, it advocated fiscal conservatism, social progressivism, environmental protection and limited government interference in personal matters. In 2007, It&#x27;s My Party Too evolved into the Republican Leadership Council.

In 2013, Huffington was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief in support of same-sex marriage, submitted to the Supreme Court during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

== Personal life ==
Huffington married Arianna Huffington, a Greek-born writer and lecturer, on April 12, 1986. They had two daughters and divorced in 1997. In December 2006, he became a blogger for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, which was co-founded by his ex-wife in 2005.

Huffington publicly disclosed that he is bisexual in 1998. Since that time, Huffington has made a number of contributions to LGBT causes. Later that year, he provided the initial grant that launched SOIN (Sexual Orientation Issues in the News) at the University of Southern California&#x27;s Annenberg School for Communication. Then in 2005, Huffington helped to establish a summer fellowship program for LGBT students at Stanford University. He also spoke at the National Equality March rally at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on October 11, 2009.

Huffington was raised Presbyterian, became Episcopalian at age 38, and ultimately joined the Greek Orthodox Church during his marriage to Arianna. Between 2007 and 2012, Huffington gave $2.5 million to establish the Huffington Ecumenical Institute at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, in order to promote dialogue between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. Concerning the institute&#x27;s mission, Huffington said, &quot;My dream is that someday I&#x27;ll get to see members of the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church be able to take communion in each other&#x27;s churches.&quot;

== Film production ==
Huffington found a post-political career as a film producer. From 1991 to 2000, he was co-owner of Crest Films Limited.

<doc id="296941" wikidata="Q1251686" url="?curid=296941" title="Northeast blackout of 1965">
<text>The northeast blackout of 1965 was a significant disruption in the supply of electricity on Tuesday, November 9, 1965, affecting parts of Ontario in Canada and Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont in the United States. Over 30 million people and 80,000 square miles (207,000 km2), and a population density of inhabitants/km2 were left without electricity for up to 13 hours.

==Cause==
The cause of the failure was the setting of a protective relay on one of the transmission lines from the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Station No. 2 in Queenston, Ontario, near Niagara Falls. The safety relay was set to trip if other protective equipment deeper within the Ontario Hydro system failed to operate properly.
On a particularly cold November evening, power demands for heating, lighting, and cooking were pushing the electrical system to near its peak capacity. Transmission lines heading into southern Ontario were heavily loaded. The safety relay had been misprogrammed, and it did what it had been asked to do: to disconnect under the loads it perceived. As a result, at 5:16 p.m. Eastern Time, a small variation of power originating from the Robert Moses generating plant in Lewiston, New York, caused the relay to trip, disabling a main power line heading into Southern Ontario. Instantly, the load that was flowing on the tripped line redistributed to the other lines, causing them to become overloaded. Their own protective relays, which are also designed to protect the lines from overload, tripped, isolating Beck Station from all of southern Ontario.

With nowhere else to go, the excess load from Beck Station was redirected east, over the interconnected lines into New York state, overloading them as well, and isolating the power generated in the Niagara region from the rest of the interconnected grid. The Beck generators, with no outlet for their power, were automatically shut down to prevent damage. The Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant continued to generate power, which supplied Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation customers in the metropolitan areas of Buffalo and Niagara Falls, New York. These areas ended up being isolated from the rest of the Northeast power grid and remained powered up. The Niagara Mohawk Western NY Huntley (Buffalo) and Dunkirk steam plants were knocked offline. Within five minutes, the power distribution system in the Northeast was in chaos as the effects of overloads and the subsequent loss of generating capacity cascaded through the network, breaking the grid into &quot;islands&quot;. Station after station experienced load imbalances and automatically shut down. The affected power areas were the Ontario Hydro System, St Lawrence-Oswego, Upstate New York, and New England. With only limited electrical connection southwards, power to the southern states was not affected. The only part of the Ontario Hydro System not affected was the Fort Erie area next to Buffalo, which was still powered by older 25 Hz generators. Residents in Fort Erie were able to pick up a TV broadcast from New York, where a local backup generator was being used for transmission purposes.

==Radio==
An aircheck of New York City radio station WABC from November 9, 1965, reveals disc jockey Dan Ingram doing a segment of his afternoon drive time show, during which he noted that a record he was playing (Jonathan King&#x27;s &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Gone to the Moon&quot;) sounded slow, as did the subsequent jingles played during a commercial break. Ingram quipped that the King record &quot;was in the key of R.&quot; The station&#x27;s music playback equipment used synchronous motors whose speed was dependent on the frequency of the powerline, normally 60 Hz. Comparisons of segments of the hit songs played at the time of the broadcast, minutes before the blackout happened, in this aircheck, as compared to the same song recordings played at normal speed reveal that approximately six minutes before blackout the line frequency was 56 Hz, and just two minutes before the blackout that frequency dropped to 51 Hz. As Si Zentner&#x27;s recording of &quot;(Up a) Lazy River&quot; played in the background – again at a slower-than-normal tempo – Ingram mentioned that the lights in the studio were dimming, then suggested that the electricity itself was slowing down, adding, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know that could happen&quot;. When the station&#x27;s &quot;Action Central News&quot; report came on at 5:25 pm ET, the staff remained oblivious to the ongoing blackout. The lead story was still Roger Allen LaPorte&#x27;s self-immolation at United Nations Headquarters earlier that day in protest of American military involvement in the Vietnam War; a taped sound bite with the attending physician played noticeably slower and lower than usual. The newscast gradually fizzled out as power was lost by the time newscaster Bill Rice started delivering the second story about New Jersey Senator Clifford P. Case&#x27;s comments on his home state&#x27;s recent gubernatorial election.

==Unaffected areas==
Some areas within the affected region were not blacked out. Municipal utilities in Hartford, Connecticut; Braintree, Hudson, Holyoke, Peabody and Taunton, Massachusetts; and Fairport, Greenport, and Walden, New York had their own power plants, which operators disconnected from the grid and which were able to sustain local loads, though some areas lost power for at least a few hours. In New York City, Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn were spared when Con Edison disconnected its Arthur Kill Generating Station from the grid. Rochdale, Queens was also unaffected as it had its own power plant.

==Effect and aftermath==
From the first failure at 5:17 p.m. near the Niagara-Canada border, the blackout moved eastward across the state, and &quot;at 5:27 p.m., the lights began sputtering in New York City, and within seconds... blacked out in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, and most of Brooklyn.&quot; The blackout was not universal in the city; some neighborhoods never lost power, notably Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn. Also, some suburban areas, including Bergen County, New Jersey – served by PSE&amp;G – did not lose power.

Fortunately, a bright full moon lit up the cloudless sky over the entire blackout area, providing some aid for the millions who were suddenly plunged into darkness.

Most telephones remained operational since the telephone exchanges were powered by emergency generators. However, not all emergency generators functioned as desired. The generator at Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse failed to start, creating a serious crisis and forcing surgeons to complete operations in progress by flashlight.

Power restoration was uneven. Most generators had no auxiliary power to use for startup. Parts of Brooklyn were repowered by 11:00 p.m., the rest of the borough by midnight. However, the entire city was not returned to normal power supply until nearly 7:00 a.m. the next day, November 10.

Power in western New York was restored in a few hours, thanks to the Genesee River-powered generating plant in Rochester, which stayed online throughout the blackout. Like starting a car, starting or restarting a generator requires power for a starter motor (see black start). The availability of this hydroelectric power was crucial; it was used to restart dead generators, which then could provide power to restart other generators, in a cascading process which required much switching by engineers at the various plants.

The Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center saw the first full-scale activation of the facility during the blackout.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; was able to produce a ten-page edition for November 10, using the printing presses of a nearby paper that was not affected, the &quot;Newark Evening News&quot;. The front page showed a photograph of the city skyline with its lights all out.

The task force that investigated the blackout found that a lack of voltage and current monitoring was a contributing factor to the blackout, and recommended improvements.

The Electric Power Research Institute helped the electric power industry develop new metering and monitoring equipment and systems, which have become the modern SCADA systems in use today.

In contrast to the wave of looting and other incidents that took place during the 1977 New York City blackout, only five reports of looting were made in New York City after the 1965 blackout. It was said to be the lowest amount of crime on any night in the city&#x27;s history since records were first kept. However, more than 800,000 riders were trapped in the subway.

Reports about an alleged baby boom that followed the blackout nine months later are considered unsubstantiated.

<doc id="296942" wikidata="Q1191750" url="?curid=296942" title="Double counting (proof technique)">
<text>In combinatorics, double counting, also called counting in two ways, is a combinatorial proof technique for showing that two expressions are equal by demonstrating that they are two ways of counting the size of one set. In this technique, which call &quot;one of the most important tools in combinatorics&quot;, one describes a finite set from two perspectives leading to two distinct expressions for the size of the set. Since both expressions equal the size of the same set, they equal each other.

==Examples==

===Multiplication (of natural numbers) commutes===
This is a simple example of double counting, often used when teaching multiplication to young children. In this context, multiplication of natural numbers is introduced as repeated addition, and is then shown to be commutative by counting, in two different ways, a number of items arranged in a rectangular grid. Suppose the grid has formula_1 rows and formula_2 columns. We first count the items by summing formula_1 rows of formula_2 items each, then a second time by summing formula_2 columns of formula_1 items each, thus showing that, for these particular values of formula_1 and formula_2, formula_9.

===Forming committees===
One example of the double counting method counts the number of ways in which a committee can be formed from formula_1 people, allowing any number of the people (even zero of them) to be part of the committee. That is, one counts the number of subsets that an formula_1-element set may have. One method for forming a committee is to ask each person to choose whether or not to join it. Each person has two choices – yes or no – and these choices are independent of those of the other people. Therefore there are formula_12 possibilities. Alternatively, one may observe that the size of the committee must be some number between 0 and formula_1. For each possible size formula_14, the number of ways in which a committee of formula_14 people can be formed from formula_1 people is the binomial coefficient
formula_17
Therefore the total number of possible committees is the sum of binomial coefficients over formula_18. Equating the two expressions gives the identity
formula_19
a special case of the binomial theorem. A similar double counting method can be used to prove the more general identity
formula_20

===Handshaking lemma===

Another theorem that is commonly proven with a double counting argument states that every undirected graph contains an even number of vertices of odd degree. That is, the number of vertices that have an odd number of incident edges must be even. In more colloquial terms, in a party of people some of whom shake hands, an even number of people must have shaken an odd number of other people&#x27;s hands; for this reason, the result is known as the handshaking lemma. 

To prove this by double counting, let formula_21 be the degree of vertex formula_22. The number of vertex-edge incidences in the graph may be counted in two different ways: by summing the degrees of the vertices, or by counting two incidences for every edge. Therefore
formula_23
where formula_24 is the number of edges. The sum of the degrees of the vertices is therefore an even number, which could not happen if an odd number of the vertices had odd degree. This fact, with this proof, appears in the 1736 paper of Leonhard Euler on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg that first began the study of graph theory.

===Counting trees===
What is the number formula_25 of different trees that can be formed from a set of formula_1 distinct vertices? Cayley&#x27;s formula gives the answer formula_27. list four proofs of this fact; they write of the fourth, a double counting proof due to Jim Pitman, that it is &quot;the most beautiful of them all.&quot;

Pitman&#x27;s proof counts in two different ways the number of different sequences of directed edges that can be added to an empty graph on formula_1 vertices to form from it a rooted tree. The directed edges point away from the root. One way to form such a sequence is to start with one of the formula_25 possible unrooted trees, choose one of its formula_1 vertices as root, and choose one of the formula_31 possible sequences in which to add its formula_32 (directed) edges. Therefore, the total number of sequences that can be formed in this way is formula_33.

Another way to count these edge sequences is to consider adding the edges one by one to an empty graph, and to count the number of choices available at each step. If one has added a collection of formula_34 edges already, so that the graph formed by these edges is a rooted forest with formula_14 trees, there are formula_36 choices for the next edge to add: its starting vertex can be any one of the formula_1 vertices of the graph, and its ending vertex can be any one of the formula_38 roots other than the root of the tree containing the starting vertex. Therefore, if one multiplies together the number of choices from the first step, the second step, etc., the total number of choices is
formula_39
Equating these two formulas for the number of edge sequences results in Cayley&#x27;s formula:
formula_40
and
formula_41
As Aigner and Ziegler describe, the formula and the proof can be generalized to count the number of rooted forests with formula_14 trees, for any

===Additional examples===
* Vandermonde&#x27;s identity, another identity on sums of binomial coefficients that can be proven by double counting.
* Square pyramidal number. The equality between the sum of the first formula_1 square numbers and a cubic polynomial can be shown by double counting the triples of numbers formula_44, formula_45, and formula_46 where formula_46 is larger than either of the other two numbers.
* Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality. Lubell&#x27;s proof of this result on set families is a double counting argument on permutations, used to prove an inequality rather than an equality.
* Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem, an upper bound on intersecting families of sets, proven by Gyula O. H. Katona using a double counting inequality.
* Proofs of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem. A divisibility proof by double counting: for any prime formula_48 and natural number formula_49, there are formula_50 length-formula_48 words over an formula_49-symbol alphabet having two or more distinct symbols. These may be grouped into sets of formula_48 words that can be transformed into each other by circular shifts; these sets are called necklaces. Therefore, formula_54(number of necklaces) and is divisible by formula_48.
* Proofs of quadratic reciprocity. A proof by Eisenstein derives another important number-theoretic fact by double counting lattice points in a triangle.

* Bijective proof. Where double counting involves counting one set in two ways, bijective proofs involve counting two sets in one way, by showing that their elements correspond one-for-one.
* The inclusion–exclusion principle, a formula for the size of a union of sets that may, together with another formula for the same union, be used as part of a double counting argument.

<text>Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is a subfield of information retrieval dealing with retrieving information written in a language different from the language of the user&#x27;s query. 
The term &quot;cross-language information retrieval&quot; has many synonyms, of which the following are perhaps the most frequent: cross-lingual information retrieval, translingual information retrieval, multilingual information retrieval. The term &quot;multilingual information retrieval&quot; refers more generally both to technology for retrieval of multilingual collections and to technology which has been moved to handle material in one language to another. The term Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR) involves the study of systems that accept queries for information in various languages and return objects (text, and other media) of various languages, translated into the user&#x27;s language. Cross-language information retrieval refers more specifically to the use case where users formulate their information need in one language and the system retrieves relevant documents in another. To do so, most CLIR systems use various translation techniques. CLIR techniques can be classified into different categories based on different translation resources: 

* Dictionary-based CLIR techniques
* Parallel corpora based CLIR techniques
* Comparable corpora based CLIR techniques
* Machine translator based CLIR techniques

CLIR systems have improved so much that the most accurate multi-lingual and cross-lingual adhoc information retrieval systems today are nearly as effective as monolingual systems. Other related information access tasks, such as media monitoring, information filtering and routing, sentiment analysis, and information extraction require more sophisticated models and typically more processing and analysis of the information items of interest. Much of that processing needs to be aware of the specifics of the target languages it is deployed in.

Mostly, the various mechanisms of variation in human language pose coverage challenges for information retrieval systems: texts in a collection may treat a topic of interest but use terms or expressions which do not match the expression of information need given by the user. This can be true even in a mono-lingual case, but this is especially true in cross-lingual information retrieval, where users may know the target language only to some extent. The benefits of CLIR technology for users with poor to moderate competence in the target language has been found to be greater than for those who are fluent. Specific technologies in place for CLIR services include morphological analysis to handle inflection, decompounding or compound splitting to handle compound terms, and translations mechanisms to translate a query from one language to another. 

The first workshop on CLIR was held in Zürich during the SIGIR-96 conference. Workshops have been held yearly since 2000 at the meetings of the Cross Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). Researchers also convene at the annual Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) to discuss their findings regarding different systems and methods of information retrieval, and the conference has served as a point of reference for the CLIR subfield. Early CLIR experiments were conducted at TREC-6, held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on November 19–21, 1997.

Google Search had a cross-language search feature that was removed in 2013.

<doc id="296955" wikidata="Q5245448" url="?curid=296955" title="Dead air">
<text>Dead air, also known as unmodulated carrier, is an unintended period of silence that interrupts a broadcast during which no audio or video program material is transmitted.

==Radio and television==
Dead air occurs in radio broadcasting when no audio program is transmitted for an extended period of time, usually more than a few seconds. In television broadcasting, the term denotes the absence of both audio and video program material. However, a carrier wave is still transmitting. In radio, the result is silence, and in television, the result is a silent black or gray screen.

Television directors may use the command &quot;fade to black&quot; or &quot;to black&quot; to indicate a momentary transition to a completely black image. However, the term &quot;dead air&quot; is most often used in cases where program material comes to an unexpected halt, either through operator error or technical malfunction. Among professional broadcasters, dead air is considered one of the worst things that can occur. Moreover, dead air may impact advertising revenue if it affects the airplay of paid commercials.

The term &quot;dead air&quot; does not refer to a broadcast transmitter that is intentionally shut down, i.e. &quot;closed&quot;, &quot;signed off&quot; or &quot;off the air&quot;, by a control operator. Such a broadcast transmitter is said to have gone &quot;dark&quot;.

==Broadcast regulations==
Broadcast stations can use programmable devices known as &quot;silence sensors&quot;, &quot;off air alarms&quot; or &quot;silence monitors&quot; that will sound an alarm and alert personnel if dead air persists more than a few seconds.

In the U.S., prolonged dead air, such as a shutdown occurring without permission, is an actionable offense that can result in fines from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). According to the FCC, a station has a 30-day limit for going silent without approval.

==Examples==
On September 11, 1987, Dan Rather walked off the set of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; when a late running U.S. Open tennis match threatened to delay the start of his news broadcast. The match then ended sooner than expected but Rather was gone. The network broadcast six minutes of dead air before Rather was found and returned to the studio. CBS affiliates criticized Rather for the incident.

One significant case of dead air occurred during Super Bowl LII in 2018, when the NBC television broadcast experienced 26 seconds of dead air during a commercial break. The network blamed &quot;a brief equipment failure.&quot; NBC reported that no commercial advertising was lost. Prior to Super Bowl XLV, Green Bay, Wisconsin, radio station WCHK-FM announced that it would intentionally go to dead air during the game, since the hometown Packers were playing in the game and station management believed nobody would be listening to music while the Super Bowl was being broadcast on another station.

==Prevention==
Many broadcasters install a silence detector independently operating from their broadcasting headquarters.
In the event of dead air lasting more than an acceptable duration, e.g. ≤ −70 dB and (if applicable) static/no picture for 30 seconds, an emergency program is cued.

The emergency program contains at least some generic audio (and video) with a station identification.
Radio stations usually play a loop of music.
The playlist is fixed so staff listening in to their own station can recognize the pattern of titles, infer how long the outage has already (at least) lasted and take action to fix the problem.

Apart from providing a safeguard in the event of &quot;unscheduled&quot; interruption (like a fire in the building or technical issues), this mechanism may be used &quot;deliberately&quot; during programmed blackouts caused by strikes of technicians, journalists, and producers.
When staff of the French public broadcasting network Radio France went on strike in September 2020, a pretaped message informing listeners that no service is available due to industrial action was inserted into the loop.

<text>Pariah Press was the company, funded by Mike Nystul, that published the first commercial edition of &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; role-playing game.

==History==
Mike Nystul self-published a new horror role-playing game called &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; (1993), which he debuted as a limited edition at GenCon 26, and founded Pariah Press the following year to release an expanded version of the game. In 2003, Ronin Arts purchased &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; and started producing new &quot;Whispering Vault&quot; material almost immediately.

<text>Ronin Arts is a role-playing game company founded as a joint venture by Philip J. Reed and Christopher Shy in 2003, to some degree a successor to Shy&#x27;s Studio Ronin and Reed&#x27;s selling of role playing games PDFs from his blog.

Ronin Arts publishes or published at some point, among other products &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot;, &quot;Star Ace&quot;, &quot;M&amp;M Superlink&quot; support, and &quot;D20 Future&quot; support.

==History==
Author Philip J. Reed and artist Christopher Shy formed the new company Ronin Arts in 2003 to showcase their talents. The first version of their website sold both the &quot;101&quot; series of books by Reed as well as illustrated art books such as the edition of &quot;Herbert West: Reanimator&quot; (2003) featuring artwork by Shy. Ronin Arts expanded that same year beyond their d20 collections by purchasing the rights to &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; by Pariah Press and &quot;Star Ace&quot; by Pacesetter. Reed and Shy started producing new material for &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; soon after, starting with &quot;Mortal Magic&quot; (2003) that was previously unpublished by Ronin Publishing, but after publishing several more PDFs in 2003, that line ceased. Reed wanted to convert &quot;Star Ace&quot; to &quot;d20 Modern&quot; but never finished work on that. Ronin Arts was so successful that Reed left Steve Jackson Games in 2004 to work full-time on the company. Around that, freelancers such as Bruce Baugh, Michael Hammes, James Maliszewski and Patrick Younts started to produce material for Ronin Arts. 

Ronin Arts has produced material for other licensed systems, such as publishing the &quot;Runic Fantasy&quot; series for the Mongoose Publishing version of &quot;RuneQuest&quot; (2006-2007), the &quot;First Edition Fantasy&quot; series for retro-clone &quot;OSRIC&quot; (2006-2007), and supplements for &quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot; (2003-2008). Hammes and Reed designed the &quot;4C System&quot; (2007), a retro-clone of the &quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; role-playing system, which then received supplements from Hazard Studio, Highmoon Games, Seraphim Guard among other companies. Ronin Arts was also able to publish an early Freeport licensed supplement, &quot;Treasures of Freeport&quot; (2004) followed by some &quot;True20&quot; supplements (2005-2006) and a long-running series of &quot;Mutants &amp; Masterminds&quot; Archetype books (2006-2007) which Green Ronin sold directly. Reed was able to sell an extended PDF series in 2006 called &quot;ePublishing 101&quot;, which explained how to succeed at PDF production. The market for PDFs had slowed down greatly by 2007 so Reed went back to work for Steve Jackson Games, and in 2008 he became their Chief Operating Officer.

Ronin Arts began as an experiment, when Reed wrote the company&#x27;s first PDF &quot;101 Spellbooks&quot;. Surprised by how quickly the gaming community embraced the product, he quickly set out to produce more. The company soon made its products available at RPGNOW.com, one of the first sites to exclusively handle the sale and promotion of roleplaying games in electronic format. From 2003 to 2007 at least, Ronin Arts was considered one of the most successful publishers in the emerging PDF industry.

In February 2007, however, they ended their relationship with RPGNOW due to creative differences.

As of March 2015, Ronin Arts&#x27; website is no longer active, having apparently been let go as of late 2012 or early 2013. Many of its products are still available by way of Lulu, Warehouse 23 and Paizo Publishing.

Not to be confused with Green Ronin Publishing, another popular producer of RPG supplements.

Nystul self-published his new horror role-playing game &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; (1993), which he debuted in a limited edition at GenCon 26. The following year, he released an expanded version of the game through his new company Pariah Press, and also published supplements such as &quot;Dangerous Prey&quot; (1995) and a three-panel gamemaster&#x27;s screen in 1995. He then worked at TSR for a short time, until 1996. Chris Pramas acquired the rights to &quot;The Whispering Vault&quot; from Nystul in 1996, and Pramas formed Ronin Arts to publish the game. Nystul also wrote several products for FASA&#x27;s &quot;Shadowrun&quot; line, and the &quot;Role Aids&quot; series published by Mayfair Games, among other material.

<doc id="296969" wikidata="Q6985583" url="?curid=296969" title="Necklace problem">
<text>The necklace problem is a problem in recreational mathematics concerning the reconstruction of necklaces (cyclic arrangements of binary values) from partial information.

== Formulation ==
The necklace problem involves the reconstruction of a necklace of formula_1 beads, each of which is either black or white, from partial information. The information specifies how many copies the necklace contains of each possible arrangement of formula_2 black beads. For instance, for formula_3, the specified information gives the number of pairs of black beads that are separated by formula_4 positions, for formula_5.
This can be made formal by defining a formula_2-configuration to be a necklace of formula_2 black beads and formula_8 white beads, and counting the number of ways of rotating a formula_2-configuration so that each of its black beads coincides with one of the black beads of the given necklace.

The necklace problem asks: if formula_1 is given, and the numbers of copies of each formula_2-configuration are known up to some threshold formula_12, how large does the threshold formula_13 need to be before this information completely determines the necklace that it describes? Equivalently, if the information about formula_2-configurations is provided in stages, where the formula_2th stage provides the numbers of copies of each formula_2-configuration, how many stages are needed (in the worst case) in order to reconstruct the precise pattern of black and white beads in the original necklace?

== Upper bounds ==
Alon, Caro, Krasikov and Roditty showed that 1 + log2(&quot;n&quot;) is sufficient, using a cleverly enhanced inclusion–exclusion principle.

Radcliffe and Scott showed that if &quot;n&quot; is prime, 3 is sufficient, and for any &quot;n&quot;, 9 times the number of prime factors of &quot;n&quot; is sufficient.

Pebody showed that for any &quot;n&quot;, 6 is sufficient and, in a followup paper, that for odd &quot;n&quot;, 4 is sufficient. He conjectured that 4 is again sufficient for even &quot;n&quot; greater than 10, but this remains unproven.

<doc id="296972" wikidata="Q909243" url="?curid=296972" title="Konami Code">
<text>The Konami Code (, &quot;Konami Komando&quot;, &quot;Konami command&quot;), also commonly referred to as the Contra Code and sometimes the 30 Lives Code, is a cheat code that appears in many Konami video games, as well as some non-Konami games. 

The code has also found a place in popular culture as a reference to the third generation of video game consoles, and is present as an Easter egg on a number of websites.

==Sequence==
In the original code, the player has to press the following sequence of buttons on the game controller to enable a cheat or other effects:

; sometimes and/or is added to the sequence.

==History==
The Konami Code was first used in the release of &quot;Gradius&quot; (1986), a scrolling shooter for the NES and was popularized among North American players in the NES version of &quot;Contra.&quot; The code is also known as the &quot;Contra Code&quot; and &quot;30 Lives Code&quot;, since the code provided the player 30 extra lives in &quot;Contra.&quot; The code has been used to help novice players progress through the game.

The Konami Code was created by Kazuhisa Hashimoto, who was developing the home port of the 1985 arcade game &quot;Gradius&quot; for the NES. Finding the game too difficult to play through during testing, he created the cheat code, which gives the player a full set of power-ups (normally attained gradually throughout the game). After entering the sequence using the controller when the game was paused, the player received all available power-ups. The code was meant to be removed prior to publishing, but this was overlooked and only discovered as the game was being prepared for mass production. The developers decided to leave it there, as removing it could result in new bugs and glitches. The sequence was easy enough to remember for testers and simultaneously sufficiently hard to enter accidentally during the gameplay for unsuspecting users.

The Konami Code was thus included in the series&#x27; other sequels and spin-offs, with some key differences. The code has been subsequently re-used in a large number of other games and other computer programs.

==Examples in video games==

;&quot;Tetris&quot; (Tengen version for Nintendo Entertainment System): Entering this code minus while paused will change the current Tetromino into the I piece, also called a longbar. This can be done only once per new game.
;&quot;&quot; (Nintendo 64): A Konami code variant was discovered in the game in 2024. The code unlocks all four characters, their outfits, and a hard difficulty mode.
;&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom&quot; (GameCube): The Konami code can be used during any map to gain gold. This will also trigger hidden dialog of a man shouting Yu-Gi-Oh.
;&quot;The Incredibles&quot; (THQ and Heavy Iron Studios, Windows, Mac, Xbox, PlayStation 2): Inputting the code into the cheats keyboard &quot;&lt;samp&gt;UUDDLRLRBAS&lt;/samp&gt;&quot; gives the player 25% health, and can be used an unlimited number of times.
;&quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal&quot; (PlayStation 2): Entering the code in the pause menu will replace the Omniwrench with a doubled ended lightsaber. In the PlayStation 3 version, whether by accident or design, two debug codes were left in the game by the developers.
;&quot;LittleBigPlanet 2&quot; (Media Molecule, PlayStation 3): When entered in the unused arcade machine at the level &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Negativatron&quot; (PlayStation 3 variation of the code), the machine explodes and unveils a square with the numbers &quot;3733 5683&quot;, which on a mobile keypad, spells the phrase &quot;free love&quot;.
;&quot;Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why&#x27;d You Steal Our Garbage?!!&quot; (Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS): Inputting the code on the title screen results in an animated looping clip of an 8-bit recreation of Adventure Time&#x27;s creator, Pendleton Ward dancing. To the left of Ward is an 8-bit version of Jake, and to the right, an 8-bit version of Finn.
;&quot;BioShock Infinite&quot; (Irrational Games, Windows, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch): A variation of the Konami Code at the game&#x27;s menus unlocks the game&#x27;s more difficult &quot;1999 Mode&quot; from the start.
;&quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;: Code entry unlocks Revengeance and Very Hard difficulties without passing the game on Hard difficulty.
;&quot;Sportsfriends&quot; (PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4): The code allows to play FLOP, a wiggly variant of Pong. A similar code accesses the hidden game Get on Top.
;&quot;Dead by Daylight&quot; (Windows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch): When the code is entered while having one of the Silent Hill characters equipped on the main menu, the game plays a jingle from Gradius and grants the player a charm that can be equipped by characters.
;&quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; (Windows, MacOS, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Mobile): The Konami code was used to access the Fortnite Durr Burger minigame at the black hole screen after the end of the Chapter 1 Season X event. It was only available for a period of 38 hours starting from 7:00pm UTC on October 13, 2019 and was no longer accessible on the start of Fortnite: Chapter 2.
;&quot;Tetris Effect&quot;: Entering the code at the launch screen enables a second screen accepting a code. Inputting the number &quot;06061984&quot; (representing June 6, 1984, the &quot;birth date&quot; of &quot;Tetris&quot;) will then unlock the &quot;1984&quot; level.
;&quot;Anno 1800&quot; (Ubisoft Blue Byte, Windows): Entering the code within the gameworld spawns hundreds of random animals flying through the air and chaotically bouncing off the terrain.
;&quot;&quot;: This spiritual sequel to &quot;Castlevania&quot; developed by Koji Igarashi lets players enter a &quot;1986 Mode&quot;, which makes the game&#x27;s controls more similar to the more-difficult &quot;Castlevania&quot; series, by entering the Konami Code at a menu screen.
;&quot;Ultrakill&quot; (Windows): Unlocks a cheat menu, with cheats bound to keyboard commands.
;&quot;Insaniquarium Deluxe&quot; (Windows, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, mobile phone, Palm OS, Windows Mobile, PDA ): Entering the code in the main menu unlocks the secret &quot;Sandbox Mode&quot;.

==Examples outside of video games==
* Entering a version of the Konami code in the Opera Browser in versions between 19 and 54 activated hidden advanced settings.

<text>The Pāli Text Society is a text publication society founded in 1881 by Thomas William Rhys Davids &quot;to foster and promote the study of Pāli texts.&quot; Pāli is the language in which the texts of the Theravada school of Buddhism are preserved. The Pāli texts are the oldest collection of Buddhist scriptures preserved in the language in which they were written down. The society first compiled, edited, and published Latin script versions of a large corpus of Pāli literature, including the Pāli Canon, as well as commentarial, exegetical texts, and histories. It publishes translations of many Pāli texts. It also publishes ancillary works including dictionaries, concordances, books for students of Pāli and the &quot;Journal of the Pali Text Society&quot;.

==History==

=== 19th century beginnings ===
Thomas William Rhys Davids was one of three British civil servants who were posted to Sri Lanka, in the 19th century, the others being George Turnour, and Robert Caesar Childers (1838–1876). At this time Buddhism in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) was struggling under the weight of foreign rule and intense missionary activity by Christians. It was an administrative requirement that all civil servants should be familiar with the language, literature, and culture of the land in which they were posted, so the three men studied with several scholar monks where, along with an introduction to Sinhala culture and language, they became interested in Buddhism.

The &quot;Pāli Text Society&quot; was founded on the model of the Early English Text Society with Rhys Davids counting on support from a lot of European scholars and Sri Lankan scholar monks. The work of bringing out the Roman text editions of the Pāli Canon was not financially rewarding, but was achieved with the backing of the Buddhist clergy in Sri Lanka who underwrote the printing costs. Childers published the first Pāli-English dictionary in 1874.

=== 20th century ===
This was superseded in 1925 by the new dictionary which had largely been compiled by T. W. Rhys Davids over 40 years, but was finished by his student William Stede. Currently another dictionary is being compiled by Margaret Cone, with the first of three volumes (A - Kh) published in 2001.

By 1922, when T. W. Rhys Davids died, the &quot;Pāli Text Society&quot; had issued 64 separate texts in 94 volumes exceeding 26,000  pages, as well a range of articles by English and European scholars.

The Pāli Text Society signed an MoU between the Dhammakaya Foundation, Thailand, on 1996 for collaboration and published the entire PTS edition of the Pāli canon on CD-ROM.

=== Preservation of palm-leaf manuscripts ===
In 1994, the Pāli Text Society inaugurated the Fragile Palm Leaves project, an attempt to catalogue and preserve Buddhist palm-leaf manuscripts from Southeast Asia. Prior to the introduction of printing presses and Western papermaking technology, texts in Southeast Asia—including the Pāli scriptures—were preserved by inscription on specially preserved leaves from palm trees. The leaves were then bound together to create a complete manuscript.

While palm-leaf manuscripts have likely been in use since before the 5th century CE, existing examples date from the 18th century and later, with the largest number having been created during the 19th century. Because of the materials used and the tropical climate, manuscripts from earlier eras are generally not found intact in palm-leaf form, and many manuscripts have been badly damaged. During the colonial era, many palm-leaf manuscripts were disassembled and destroyed, with individual pages of texts being sold as decorative &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot; to Western collectors.

The Pāli Text Society created the Fragile Palm Leaves project to collect, catalogue, and preserve these artifacts, including scanning them into electronic formats in order to make them available to researchers without threatening their preservation. In 2001 the project was formalised as a nonprofit in Thailand as the Fragile Palm Leaves Foundation.

In February 2013, the Pāli Text Society, Sendai University, and the University of Toronto, along with local partners, began an ongoing initiative to digitise and catalogue Myanmar&#x27;s palm-leaf manuscripts, including collections from U Pho Thi Library in Thaton, and Bagaya Monastery in Inwa. The digitised manuscripts are available at the open-access Myanmar Manuscript Digital Library.

== Mission ==
The Pāli Text Society was founded with the goal of spreading the academic merit of Buddhism across Europe. It is a learned Society, dedicated not only to the translation of the Pāli Canon, but to the publication of a variety of Buddhist literature, the teaching of the Pāli language, and to spread their publications to libraries across Europe. The Pāli Text Society, specifically its founder, Thomas William Rhys Davids, and his wife, Carolina Augusta Foyley Rhys Davids,  have been attributed to creating the discipline of Buddhist studies. Scholar George D. Bond writes that the historical significance of the Davids’ family work, as well as the Society’s work, “&quot;contributes to a new understanding of the British Raj in India and Ceylon”.&quot; Furthermore, the Davids’s understood that not only did Buddhism in Sri Lanka hold a rich religious history, but that Pāli itself was the second oldest language East Asian religious texts had been recorded in, the first being the Vedanic tradition. The linguistic merit of Pāli was so culturally significant because, as Foyley writes, the language was “&quot;as dead as is Latin, and yet as alive, built out of old Indian dialects as the vehicle of the Canon…”.&quot; 

== Thomas William Rhys Davids&#x27; contributions ==
The motivation for the formation of the Pāli Text Society has its roots in Thomas William Rhys Davids’ Civil Service career. Since he had familial connections to ministry, and he received his education in Germany, studying both Greek and Sanskrit, Rhys Davids was employed by the British government to serve as an administrator in Sri Lanka from 1864 to 1872. During this decade of his career, Rhys Davids was posted in both Galle and Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, serving as a clergyman, a judge, Secretary to Governor William Henry Gregory, and as Archeological Commissioner. According to scholarly reviews of his work by George D. Bond and Ananda Wickremeratne,  Rhys Davids’ Civil Service work was dedicated to the process of Anglicization, and committed to &quot;“instilling English ideas of industry and liberty among people”&quot;. However, his wife, Carolina Foyley Rhys Davids, documents that her husband, despite both his familial and educational ties to the study of religion, was atheist, and that his fascination with Sri Lankan culture came from a place of greater academic cultural curiosity.

It was a common recurrence that members of the Anglican clergy would hold public debates against the Buddhists clergy and lay people alike of Sri Lanka. While these debates were intended to be demonstrations of Christian superiority, they actually increased the interest in Buddhism, both in the community and for Rhys Davids. From there, Rhys Davids went on to study the Pāli language and Sinhalese with Ceylon Monk, Yatramulle Sri Dhammarama. Dhammarama was the one who taught Rhys Davids of the Pāli Canon, on which he later dedicated his public career to, including the formation of the Pāli Text Society. Although, in Europe during this period of time, Buddhist studies did not exist as an academic discipline, Rhys Davids sought to challenge Eurocentric ideas of Christian supremacy in order to argue in support of Buddhism as a valid religious area of knowledge. Despite his apparent atheism, as a scholar, Rhys Davids could appreciate faith through an understanding of uncovered knowledge. According to Foyley, Rhys Davids’ goal for the Pāli Text Society was to &quot;“fructify the new attention that had just begun to be given to monastic libraries of ‘palm-leaf manuscripts.”&quot;

== The Contributions of Women to the Society: Carolina Augusta Foyley Rhys Davids ==
In &quot;Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute,&quot; Carolina Augusta Foyley Rhys Davids recounts how by 1936, the society was losing financial support due to the economic state of the country during The Great Depression. Following the passing of her husband, Thomas William Rhys Davids, in 1922, Foyley took over the Society’s president; like her husband, her career was in Buddhist Studies, and she was a scholar of both the Pāli language and Sanskrit. However, because Foyley’s educational background was in economics, she was the one that managed the Society’s finances, and furthermore, it was Foyley who helped pull the Society out of debt.

Foyley dedicated her entire career to completing the work of her late husband. Under her presidency, she was able to publish two editions of &quot;Journal of the Pāli Text Society&quot;, both which took roughly three years to complete. She also continued to work on the translations of the classic Pāli Texts, including two volumes on the translation of &quot;Apadna,&quot; published by the Society in 1925 and 1927 respectively. A 1926 annual report, published in the second edition of &quot;The Journal of the Pāli Text Society&quot; (1924-1927), reveals that the Society had recently published a new Pāli Dictionary to replace Robert Caesar Childers&#x27;s, which Foyley quoted to be &quot;antiquated and imperfect&quot;, the funding of which was provided by donors in Japan. In that same report, Foyley mentions how the publication of the new dictionary was one of the most costly expenses over the past three years, but how support from donations and subscriptions to the Society&#x27;s works helped to keep the Society financially stable, both attributed to Foyley&#x27;s economic genius.

The following is the subscription plan for the Pāli Text Society, as Foyley records it in the 1926 report:

&quot;&quot;The Subscription to the Society is One Guinea a year, for texts, or a text and Journals, and ten shillings a year for a translation, payable in advance.&quot;

&quot;Publications, two volumes a year, and, when possible, a translation, are sent post free on receipt of the subscription.&quot;

&quot;Back issues are sent post free on payment of the subscription for the year, or years, in which the volumes were issued (that is, of One Guinea a year or a proportional payment per volume). But the payment for issues dating prior to 1901 is now increased 50 per cent&quot;.&quot; 

Upon acknowledging how little time she had left, she wrote in a diary entry &quot;&quot;It is not likely I shall be here to finish to our work”,&quot; referring to the re-issuing of the original translations of Vinaya, Milinda, and Jataka. Foyley died in 1942, leaving the presidency of the Society to William Henry Denham Rouse.

<doc id="296977" wikidata="Q440068" url="?curid=296977" title="Old Finland">
<text>Old Finland (; ; ) is a name used for the areas that Russia gained from Sweden in the Great Northern War (1700–1721) and the Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743), and which were united as the Vyborg Governorate in 1744. During the Finnish War of 1808–1809, Russia annexed the rest of the present-day Finland, and formed the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland (&quot;New Finland&quot;) out of those areas. Old Finland was joined to the Grand Duchy in 1812 as Viipuri Province.

==History==

In the Treaty of Nystad (1721) that concluded the Great Northern War, Sweden was forced to cede Käkisalmi County and Viborg/Viipuri County to Russia. The ceded Finnish-speaking Ingria around Saint Petersburg, however, was not included in Old Finland. In the Treaty of Åbo (1743) Sweden had to cede the areas in southern Karelia east of the Kymi river and around Savonlinna to Russia.

The Russian ruler guaranteed religion, property rights, old Swedish laws, and some privileges to the inhabitants of these territories. However, a circumvention occurred, as the Russian administrators and Russian military were unfamiliar with the Swedish system. The Russians were used to a different system with its serfs, serfdom. As a result, the economy of the area was markedly different from that on the other side of the border.

The ruler&#x27;s guarantee froze the situation. Thus legal developments in Sweden were not introduced to these areas: the Viipuri and Käkisalmi territory did not adopt the 1734 General Law of Sweden (though Hamina (Fredrikshamn), Lappeenranta (Villmanstrand), and Savonlinna (Nyslott), at the time still Swedish, of course did adopt it), and the new constitution of King Gustav III was not implemented in the entire area.

The territories enjoyed a sort of autonomy and much particularism, since the Russian rulers applied similar principles here as in the Baltic Provinces. The administration resembled a German principality, rather than a Russian province.

Under Russian rule the combined territories formed the Vyborg Governorate, or Government of Vyborg.

Ecclesiastically, the areas were administered as a diocese, but without a bishop. The church building in Viipuri and another in Hamina were assigned as cathedrals, with a diocesan chapter (&quot;consistory&quot;), led by the archdean.

The area was not forced to contribute men to the Russian Army until 1797. However, there were many non-Finnish troops in the area, especially after the 1788–90 war.

Scandinavian-style district courts continued in judicial function, each with a judge and lay members. However, the Russian estate owners and military often ignored these courts&#x27; decisions and imposed illegal punishments on the peasants.

Because of the absence of an evenly applied, up-to-date legal system in the area, apathy in some ways dominated among Old Finland&#x27;s residents; and not many figures from the area have a prominent place in history. Two of these are Maximilian von Alopeus and his brother David Alopaeus, born into a Finnish family in Viipuri and both later serving many posts in Imperial administration, including ambassador in some Central European countries.

These areas, Government of Vyborg, were later referred to as &quot;Old Finland&quot;; and from the beginning of 1812, they were incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Finland, where the newly acquired provinces from Sweden were &quot;New Finland&quot;. The population in these provinces came to receive the same legal system as the rest of the Grand Duchy, including its Constitution and General Law, although some privileges took time to implement. The so-called donated estates (owned by Russian noblemen) in Karelia were a headache resolved slowly by monetary compensation from the Grand Duchy&#x27;s Treasury. This was a long lasting burden, as the last instance of compensation was not until the 1870s.

<doc id="296981" wikidata="Q5544754" url="?curid=296981" title="George Square">
<text>George Square () is the principal civic square in the city of Glasgow, Scotland. It is one of six squares in the city centre, the others being Cathedral Square, St Andrew&#x27;s Square, St Enoch Square, Royal Exchange Square, and Blythswood Square on Blythswood Hill.

Named after King George III and initially laid out in 1781 but not developed for another twenty years, George Square is surrounded by architecturally important buildings including on the east side the palatial Municipal Chambers, also known as the City Chambers, whose foundation stone was laid in 1883, and on the west side by the . Built by Glasgow Corporation, the Chambers are the continuing headquarters of Glasgow City Council. Joseph Swan&#x27;s panoramic engraving of 1829 shows the early development of the square and its surrounding buildings.

The square boasts an important collection of statues and monuments, including those dedicated to Robert Burns, James Watt, Sir Robert Peel and Sir Walter Scott.

==Historical development==
Medieval Glasgow had a large area of common pasture to the west and north of the city. Every day, the town herd took the cattle of the burghers along an unpaved road called Cow Lone which led from the Trongate&#x27;s West Port to pasture on the common, then on to Cowcaddens where the cattle were milked in the evening before returning. Long narrow back gardens or riggs ran north from Trongate properties, forming the Langcroft area, and along its northern boundary Back Cow Lone provided an alternative route west from the High Street. Cow Lone ran north between the Meadowflat lands (to the west) and the Ramshorn croft, which was bounded to the north by Rottenrow lane, and on the east by Deanside Brae, down via Greyfriar&#x27;s Wynd (Shuttle Street) to Candleriggs. These lands became George Hutcheson&#x27;s property in 1609. Hutcheson&#x27;s Hospital tried to lease areas to small crofts or gardeners but the ground was poor. In 1772 the city magistrates bought the lands of Ramshorn and Meadowflats.

From 1750 wealth from tobacco, sugar and cotton brought rapid expansion westwards, with new streets laid out along the riggs, including, starting at Argyle Street, Virginia Street in 1753 and Miller Street in 1762. Cow Lone, impassible in wet weather, was renamed Queen street after Queen Charlotte in 1766, and paved as far as the junction with Back Cow Lone, which in 1772 was straightened and renamed Ingram Street. In that year the town&#x27;s surveyor, James Barrie (or Barry), produced a grid plan for the Ramshorn lands, similar to planned development in London and Craig&#x27;s 1766 gridded plan for Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town. Barrie produced another plan in 1781, and in 1782 Glasgow&#x27;s council adopted a grid incorporating a large square. This provided &quot;a regular plan to the line of the streets in which every purchaser was bound to keep&quot;, later extended over Meadowflats. In 1782 a house for two families was built in George Square, then there was a four-year pause before rapid growth began. Directly in line with the projected extension of Queen Street, a large mansion was built around 1783 in grounds just south of Rottenrow lane as Bailie George Crawford&#x27;s Lodging, later known as Glasgow House.

George&#x27;s square, as it was known initially, was named after King George III. New streets named after royalty included Hanover street and Frederick street. Around 1790 the developments north of Trongate became known as Glasgow&#x27;s New Town (in post-1980 regeneration this general area was rebranded as the Merchant City).

Between 1787 and the 1820s Georgian terraces were built around the perimeter of George&#x27;s square. The west side (in line with Queen Street) was a three-storey high block of six tenements, which had three entrances with passageways to turnpike stairs at the back for the upper flats. These &quot;plain dwellings&quot; were &quot;the residences of many most respectable families&quot;, but were criticised as looking like soldier&#x27;s barracks or a cotton mill. The east side was a two-storey high terrace of &quot;comfortable dwelling-houses with a double flight of steps to the second storey&quot;. By 1807 a hotel occupied the south end of this terrace, it later became the George Hotel. 
On the south and north sides, terraces of large townhouses had three storeys above a basement lit by a sunken area fenced off from the pavement. As Glasgow historian James Denholm wrote of &quot;George&#x27;s square&quot; in 1804, &quot;The buildings here are very elegant, particularly those upon the north; which, from the beauty of the design, and taste displayed in the execution, surpass by far any other either in this city or in Scotland.&quot;
The north side was completed 1807–1818 with three imposing townhouses built between Queen Street and Hanover Street.

James Ewing of Strathleven bought Glasgow House in 1815, its grounds became known as the &quot;Queen Street Park&quot;. Crows nested in tall trees around his mansion, and he was nicknamed &quot;Craw Ewing&quot;. The centre of George Square had been used as a tip for surplus soil and debris around a stagnant pool, it was enclosed with a paling fence and used for grazing sheep. The first statue, erected in 1819 on the south of the square facing Miller Street, commemorated Sir John Moore of Corunna.


In 1825 the Corporation instructed Stewart Murray, the curator and landscape architect of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sandyford, to improve the square. He landscaped it with winding walks, trees and shrubs, fenced around with an iron railing. Flower shows were organised, held in tents. The centre spot was used to commemorate Sir Walter Scott with the first ever monument dedicated to him. The 80 foot fluted Doric column of Giffnock &quot;liver rock&quot; sandstone was designed by the competition winning architect David Rhind, who appointed John Greenshields to design the statue above, which was executed by John Ritchie. The monument was completed by 1837, some years before Scott was commemorated in Edinburgh.

From March to July 1834 the Steam Carriage Company of Scotland ran an hourly service to Paisley from its terminus at the northeast corner of the square. 
In 1838 James Ewing sold Glasgow House to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, who demolished it and built their terminus in its grounds, with station buildings in Dundas Street. It opened in 1842, and was later named the Queen Street Station, with its main entrance a direct continuation of Queen Street. Several nearby houses were soon converted into accommodation for travellers. The Glasgow and Edinburgh Chop House and Commercial Lodgings, on the west side of the square, was taken over by George Cranston shortly before his daughter Kate Cranston was born in 1849. It was renamed the Edinburgh and Glasgow Hotel, and subsequently known as Cranston&#x27;s Hotel. Around 1855 town houses on the north side of the square to were converted into The Royal, The Crown and The Queen&#x27;s Hotel. The Cranstons, seeking to enlarge their premises, moved about 1860 into the Crow Hotel, third from the south end. Around 1866, after the two tenements at the south end were demolished, the Cranstons moved to the Crown Hotel on the north side of the square.

Along the south side, terraces came into new uses or new buildings erected, including business use, manufacturing and tenements. Around 1863 Henry Monteith &amp; Co. had Italian Renaissance-style offices built, probably designed by John Burnet.

In 1865 the two southern tenements on the west side were demolished, and the Bank of Scotland&#x27;s Italianate building designed by John Thomas Rochead was built in their place 1867–1870, followed in 1874–1876 by a matching extension taking up the central third of the block. The bank&#x27;s elevation was reflected in the (1875–1880), but symmetry was unbalanced by its corner tower, and the later addition of two more storeys.

Glasgow Corporation took over the management of George Square in 1862. When the Post Office foundation stone was laid by the Prince of Wales in 1878 the square&#x27;s iron railings were removed, transverse walks formed, and flower beds introduced.

The terrace of houses along the east side of the square was demolished in 1883 as the site for the Glasgow City Chambers, designed by the architect William Young. Its foundation stone was laid on 6 October 1883, and the building was completed in 1889.
The terrace built 1807–1818 between Queen Street and Hanover Street on the north side of the square became known as the Queen&#x27;s Hotel. In 1905 it became the North British Railway company&#x27;s North British Station Hotel, and the attic was converted into a fourth storey, under a mansard roof giving further accommodation. Since 1878 Kate Cranston had made a great success of her Tea Rooms. Following the death of her husband in 1917 she sold several of her assets, including the Willow Tearooms, and at the age of 68 settled herself in the North British which was now the last hotel in the square, looking over the sites of the hotels where she had been born and grew up. In 1933 she moved to a house where she was looked after by a lady companion, and she died on 18 April 1934. Following nationalisation, the hotel came under British Transport Hotels. The gable of Queen Street Station&#x27;s curved glass roof remained visible above its main entrance until 1969 when a new building was constructed supported by columns over the entrance way: this subsequently became an extension to the hotel. In 1984 British Rail sold the hotel, which was now called the Copthorne Hotel, and in 1986 a ground floor conservatory was built along its frontage, extending out to the pavement of the square. It was subsequently renamed the Millennium Hotel, and is now a listed building, the only survivor of the original terraces around George Square. 

Major reconstruction of Queen Street Station has seen demolition of its buildings along George Square and round the corner to Dundas Street, construction of the new glazed entrance from George Square began in December 2018. The Millennium Hotel has put forward proposals for major works including new rooms to replace those which were above the station entrance.

==Prominent buildings==
Today the east side of the square, linking North Frederick Street and South Frederick Street, is dominated by the ornate Glasgow City Chambers, designed by architect William Young, and completed in 1889.

On the South side, linking Cochrane Street and St Vincent Place, the former General Post Office built in 1878 takes up the block between South Frederick Street and South Hanover Street. It was redeveloped into offices in 2007. The block between there and Queen Street has a Chicago-style office building, dating from 1924. The city&#x27;s main Tourist Information Centre was located in a prefabricated wooden building on the west side of the square from the 1960s to the mid 1980s, when it then moved to the buildings on the southern side, but has since moved to Buchanan Street.

The North side, running along George Street towards the University of Strathclyde, has the entrance to Queen Street Station followed by a terrace of three townhouses built 1807–1818, then enlarged with an additional storey in 1905 as the North British Railway&#x27;s Hotel (now the Millennium Hotel). To the east of North Hanover Street, George House was built in 1979-80 (replacing an older Georgian building) to provide extra office space for Glasgow City Council. It was for many years the Glasgow offices of the financial and legal firm Ernst &amp; Young. Since the early 1960s the northern vista of the square has been dominated by the tower block of Glasgow College of Building and Printing (retrospectively known as the Met Tower), which stands half way up North Hanover Street.

Queen Street, running parallel to the square&#x27;s West side, was formerly a row of hotels and now features the Merchants&#x27; House building for the guildry formed in 1603 to establish the rights, duties and privileges of the merchants and craftsmen of Glasgow. Westbourne Music perform regularly here in a series of Merchants Music, as do jazz ensembles and other instrumentalists. The building also houses the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, founded in 1783. Designed by John Burnet and opened in 1874, two storeys were added to the Merchants&#x27; House by his son J.J. Burnet in 1907 and are topped by a domed tower on which is perched the emblem of the House a ship on a globe, a reminder of the importance of sea trade to Glasgow&#x27;s prosperity. The western side is also the location of the former Bank of Scotland building, and even more palatial buildings sweep round to St Vincent Place and Buchanan Street.

==Monuments and statues==

The eastern side of the square itself is flanked by two lawns and is also the site of the Glasgow Cenotaph, which was designed by Sir John James Burnet and originally built to commemorate Glaswegians killed in the First World War. It was conceived in 1921, and unveiled in 1924 by Field Marshall Earl Haig.

The column in the centre of the square celebrates author Sir Walter Scott. It was erected in 1837. Eleven of Glasgow&#x27;s many other public statues are situated around the square: the only known equestrian statues of a young Queen Victoria 1854 in St Vincent Place at Buchanan Street and moved to George Square in 1866 beside her husband Prince Albert 1866 both sculpted by Carlo Marochetti, erected in 1865 and 1866 respectively; poets Robert Burns sculpted by George Edwin Ewing, 1877, and Thomas Campbell sculpted by William Bodie, 1877; inventor James Watt sculpted by Francis Leggatt Chantrey, 1832; chemist Thomas Graham sculpted by William Brodie, 1872; General Sir John Moore sculpted by John Flaxman, 1819, and Field Marshall Lord Clyde sculpted by John Henry Foley, 1868; and politicians William Ewart Gladstone sculpted by William Hamo Thornycroft, 1902, Robert Peel sculpted by John Mossman, 1859, and James Oswald sculpted by Carlo Marochetti, 1856, first located at Charing Cross and moved to George Square in 1875.

==Social history==

George Square is also a place for musical events, light shows, ceremonies, sporting celebrations, political gatherings, and for annual Remembrance Day parades.

The square has often been the scene of political events and, protests. Perhaps the most famous was the Battle of George Square in 1919, when skilled engineers campaigning for a 40-hour working week held a rally. Although a crowd of over 100,000 is often claimed, contemporary sources put it at 20–25,000. The meeting descended into violence between the protesters and the police, with the riot act being read. The city&#x27;s radical reputation, and the raising of the red flag on 27 January (although the strike leaders disassociated themselves from this action), made some members of the Coalition government fear a Bolshevik revolution was afoot. The Sheriff of Lanarkshire called for military assistance. Ten thousand troops, mainly from Scotland, were deployed, although they did not arrive until the riot was over. Six tanks arrived the following Monday, but never left their depot in the Cattle Market.

In February 2005, the square was closed to pedestrians for a two-month restoration project, including the replacement of the red asphalt concourse, and the cleaning of stone and the statues in the square, most notably that of Walter Scott.

Scenes for the zombie movie &quot;World War Z&quot; were filmed in the square in August 2011, using the resemblance of buildings to Philadelphia&#x27;s financial district.

Plans to remove the greenspace and lease the area for temporary businesses and events has been controversial. In 2012 a campaign was started to restore the square to its previous state.

==Remodelling==
In 2012 Glasgow City Council voted to spend £15m on a &quot;makeover&quot;, of the square, in preparation for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, to make it &quot;a place fit for the 21st Century&quot;. The plans included removing all of the monuments and statues in the square, ostensibly for restoration. However, the council said that &quot;it is possible&quot; that the monuments &quot;may not return to the square&quot;, but will rather be relocated to &quot;an area of regeneration&quot;. Only one monument was certain to remain; the Cenotaph by Sir John James Burnet.

On 9 January 2013, the six shortlisted designs were put on display to the public in a nearby gallery. All the designs featured at least half the statues returning, with many containing all 11. Claiming public opposition, the council leader Gordon Matheson announced the cancellation of the redevelopment plan on the very day the winner (by John McAslan &amp; Partners) was announced. Councillor Matheson had supported a different proposal from the one chosen by an expert panel of judges.

<text>Davao Oriental (; ), officially the Province of Davao Oriental (; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Davao Region in Mindanao. Its capital is the city of Mati which is the most populous, and it borders the province of Davao de Oro to the west, and Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur to the north. The province is the traditional homeland of the Mandaya and Kalagan/Kaagan.

Davao Oriental is the easternmost province in the country with Pusan Point in the municipality of Caraga as the easternmost location. The Philippine Sea, part of the Pacific Ocean, faces Davao Oriental to the east. Part of the province lies on an unnamed peninsula that encloses Davao Gulf to the west.

The province is the top producer of coconut and copra in the country, earning the province the title &quot;Coconut Capital of the Philippines&quot;. It is also home to Mount Hamiguitan Wildlife Sanctuary, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Etymology==
The name of the province was derived from the word, Dabaw, of which the center was west of the province.

==History==

===Early history===

The present territory of Davao Oriental was covered by the historical region of Caraga, which was partly under the Sultanate of Maguindanao.

===Spanish colonial era===
The Spaniards established a permanent settlement in the region in 1591, and in 1844, the area was ceded by the Sultanate to Spain. An expedition was sent by the colonial government in Manila in 1847 to control the region, led by the Spaniard Jose Oyanguren, who settled in the town of Davao and organized the surrounding areas into the province of Nueva Guipozcoa in 1849. The province existed until 1858, when the politico-military &quot;commandancia&quot;s of Davao and Bislig were created in its place. Bislig was incorporated into the District of Davao two years later.

===American colonial era===


In 1903, the colonial American government created the Moro Province comprising several districts, one of which was Davao. The Moro province was converted in 1914 into the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, and its component districts were made into independent provinces.

===Japanese occupation===
In 1942, the territory of what is now Davao Oriental was occupied by the Japanese Imperial forces.

In 1945, the Battle of Davao began with the combined forces of the British, Australian, Dutch and the Filipino troops of the 6th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th, 106th, 107th and 110th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 10th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary being supported by Davaoeño guerrilla fighter units in attacking Japanese Imperial forces during the liberation in Eastern Davao or Eastern Davao Campaign until the end of the Second World War.

===Philippine independence===
====Foundation====
On May 8, 1967, through &quot;Republic Act No. 4867&quot;, the province of Davao was divided into three independent provinces, one of which was Davao Oriental.

===Contemporary===
The capital town of Mati became a component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 9408&quot; which sought to convert the municipality into a city. The law was ratified on June 16, 2007. However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law. The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.

==Geography==
Davao Oriental covers a total area of occupying the eastern tip of the Davao Region in Mindanao. The province is bordered by Davao de Oro to the west, Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur to the north, Davao Gulf to the southwest, and the Philippine Sea to the east and southeast.

The Eastern Pacific Cordillera mountain range encompasses the province. To the east of the range lie narrow strips of coastal areas, which feature several inlets and bays. The province encloses Davao Gulf to the southwest.

<text>Marino Faliero (, 1274 – 17 April 1355) was the 55th Doge of Venice, appointed in September 1354. He was executed for attempting a coup d&#x27;etat.

==Origin and family==
Marino Faliero was born the son of Jacopo Faliero and Bettiola of the Loredan family. Marino had three brothers, Ordelaffo, Marco, and Jacopo, and a sister, Francesca. The Faliero family was one of the oldest in the Venetian patriciate, legend tracing its origins to the myths surrounding the foundation of Venice itself in Late Antiquity. By the 14th century, it was counted among the twelve most prestigious, so-called &quot;apostolic&quot; noble families. 

Marino married twice. The name of his first wife, who died sometime before 1328, is unknown, but may have been a member of the Contarini family (the same as his grandmother&#x27;s). The couple had numerous children: Lucia, Marco, Nicoletto, Maddalena, Andriota, Caterina, and Tommasina. His second marriage, in 1335, was to the much younger Alvica Gradenigo, a granddaughter of Doge Pietro Gradenigo (). This marriage was childless.

==Early career==
The Faliero family had many branches and many of its members shared the same, name which makes distinguishing them difficult for modern historians. At the time of Marino&#x27;s early life there were two other namesakes, a remote cousin who died shortly after 1320, and a paternal uncle, who died around 1330. As a result, information about Marino Faliero&#x27;s early career is only certain after 1330.

===Service in the Council of Ten and overseas===
The first known public post of Faliero is attested in October 1315, when he was one of the three heads () of the Council of Ten, convened to examine the case of a sympathizer of the failed 1310 Tiepolo conspiracy. Faliero&#x27;s own role during the 1310 events is nowhere mentioned, but from his later appointment it appears that he supported the—victorious—loyalist side. Faliero continued as a member of the council until 1320 and held the office of head of the Ten as well as state inquisitor several times during this period. In early 1320 he was charged with Andrea Michiel to organize the killing of Bajamonte Tiepolo and Pietro Querini, the only two leaders of the conspiracy still at large. 

From then until 1323, Faliero&#x27;s activities are unknown, other than records of mercantile activity in 1321 and early 1323. In April of the latter year, he was named (governor) and captain (military commandant) of Negroponte (Euboea), a Venetian-ruled island in the Aegean Sea. In 1326 he was again in Venice as a member of the Council of Ten, but in May of the following year he left for Bologna on a diplomatic mission along with Marco Michiel to the prior of the Servites who had a dispute with Venice. Back again in Venice he again served in the Ten, he left shortly after to be elected to the police board of the Five Elders to Peace (). He is next mentioned in a number of private deeds in 1329, and was elected to the Council of Ten in August of the same year, and again at the start of 1330.

In 1333 Faliero became captain of the galleys destined for the Black Sea and of Constantinople, his first known military posting. His task was the protection of the merchant ships going to Tanais. He was back in Venice by 31 October, when he was tasked with examining the affairs of the East, notably the reports sent to Venice by the—largely Venetian-sponsored—Holy League and from Negroponte, as well as serving in commissions on the matters of navigation in the East. In early 1334 Faliero was elected as (governor) of the Dalmatian island of Lesina (Hvar). He remained at this post from early March 1334 to late June 1335. In July he was member of a commission examining letters from Hélion de Villeneuve, the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, and a month later of a commission concerning correspondence with King James III of Majorca. During the same time he also wedded his second wife, Alvica Gradenigo. In November 1335 Faliero was elected as a , the board tasked with naval affairs. 

===Governorships and ambassadorships===
With the Scaliger War looming, in May 1336 Faliero was member of a commission sent to supervise the defence of the former Caminesi lands annexed by Venice. He then served as one of the two Venetian members (along with two Florentine ones) in the council assisting the anti-Scaliger alliance&#x27;s captain-general, Pietro de&#x27; Rossi, until late autumn 1336. From 1 May 1337 to 28 February 1338 he served as of Chioggia, immediately on the next day assuming his post as of Padua, which had only recently been freed from Scaliger rule and was now a protectorate of Venice and Florence. Faliero held the post until February 1339, and during this time cooperated with the city&#x27;s lord, Ubertino I da Carrara, in a comprehensive overhaul of the Paduan statutes to secure the position of the new Carraresi regime and its ruling family. Among the reforms was a revision of the eligibility criteria for the Paduan Great Council that echoed Venice&#x27;s own of 1297, by making membership more restrictive and founded on a hereditary basis.

Elected as the first Venetian of Treviso on 26 January 1339, Faliero took up his new post on 11 February, holding it until December of that year. During the next year he was a member of various commissions of &#x27;wise men&#x27; () on diverse issues, domestic as well as foreign, ranging from preparations in Dalmatia for a possible war with King Louis I of Hungary to an examination of usury practices, or supervising road construction in Venice. From May 1341 to January 1342 he served as of Serravalle, followed by a second term as of Chioggia from April 1342 to April 1343, although his actual tenure was shorter, since in March he was recalled to Venice for consultations. During the following months he played a role in resolving the legal disputes of the former Caminesi lords; acting as guarantor in an agreement between and and the Bishop of Ceneda, Faliero was rewarded by the former with ownership of the castle of Fregona. In spring 1344 Faliero was sent as envoy, along with Andrea Corner, to Pope Clement VI in Avignon. The mission, to receive papal permission to trade with Alexandria—ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate and thus normally prohibited for Christian merchants—was a success. During his absence, Faliero was elected again of Chioggia, a post which was filled by his brother Ordelaffo until Marino returned from Avignon. He remained in this post till 1 May 1345. 

In September Faliero was briefly part of a commission dealing with the revolt of Zara (Zadar), the chief Venetian possession in Dalmatia. On 20 November Faliero was designated captain of the naval forces against Zara, but this was soon altered to a six-month command of the land forces ten days later, a move of uncertain legality as Faliero had already accepted the previous appointment. He never seems to have exercised this command, however, and on 14 January 1346 he was again named captain of the sea. Sailing to Zara with a fleet, he arrived there at the end of February, but already in March was obliged to subordinate himself to Pietro Civran, who arrived at the scene with another Venetian fleet as commander-in-chief of all naval forces. With the defeat of a relief attempt by King Louis I of Hungary in early July, the military situation dramatically shifted in favour of the Venetians, and by the end of the same month Faliero was back in Venice. From 4 August 1346 to 4 August 1347 Faliero served a second term as of Treviso. 

In November 1347, Faliero was member of a commission to examine correspondence with Louis I of Hungary, before going for a second term as to Serravalle in the next year. In the meantime, Venice was devastated by the Black Death, which killed his brother, Ordelaffo. While still at Serravalle, on 24 September 1348, Faliero was elected captain-general of the land forces against the city of Capodistria (Koper), which had revolted against Venetian rule. By the time he arrived in Venice and began preparations, however, the revolt was already subdued, and he only went to Capodistria as a commissioner in November, to ensure its defence and examine how the revenue derived from it could be increased. In February–April 1349, as , he was charged with the Republic&#x27;s deteriorating relationship with its traditional rival, the Republic of Genoa, which would soon lead to the outbreak of the Third Genoese–Venetian War. He was then sent as envoy to the papal legate, , on the issue of the accumulated arrears, due to the plague and the imminent war with Genoa, of the , the tithe that ought to be paid to the Church from the property of deceased Venetians. Neither Faliero nor his eventual successors could resolve the matter, which festered and poisoned the Republic&#x27;s relations with the Church for decades. 

By May 1349, Faliero was again serving an annual term as of Chioggia. In July the same year, in a ceremony at Ceneda, he was invested with the fief of Valmareno, which was ceded by Rizzardo VII da Camino in exchange for a loan from the Republic. In May 1350, he served in a board on the affairs of Dalmatia, was briefly again envoy to the papal legate, and in June was appointed to the five-member commission examining relations with Genoa. Elected ambassador to the Duke of Austria, Albert II, Faliero was eventually replaced in this task and sent instead to an embassy to Genoa, in hopes of averting the imminent conflict. The decree of his appointment makes clear the high hopes vested in him, claiming that &quot;our fates are largely entrusted in the person of the ambassador&quot;. He was given ample remit to conclude an agreement as he saw fit, or to refer the matter to papal arbitration. Officially confirmed on 31 July, Faliero set out, but already on 2 August, he received messages that instructed him to stay put, and then to turn back, leaving only his secretary, Amadeo, to continue with the mission. The reason for this was news received in Venice that Venetian citizens had been killed by the Genoese in the Black Sea. Even though newer messages confirmed this not to be the case, the subsequent proposals for Faliero to continue his journey, or for another ambassador to be sent in his stead, fell through, making war inevitable.

In 1352 Faliero was sent on a diplomatic mission and met with the Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Alexander in Nicopolis, giving him a letter from the doge Andrea Dandolo.

==Doge of Venice==

Faliero was a naval and military commander and then a diplomat before being elected doge in succession to Andrea Dandolo. He learned of his election while he was on a diplomatic mission to the papal court at Avignon. The populace of Venice was at that time disenchanted with the ruling aristocrats who were blamed for a recent naval defeat by the fleet of the Republic of Genoa at the 1354 Battle of Portolungo during the Third Venetian–Genoese War.

Within months of being elected, Faliero attempted a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; in April 1355, aiming to take effective power from the ruling aristocrats. According to tradition, this came about because the dogaressa, Faliero&#x27;s second wife, Aluycia Gradenigo, had been insulted by Michele Steno, a member of an aristocratic family, but in a study of doges of Venice Antonella Grignola suggests that Faliero&#x27;s move was consistent with a prevailing trend in Italian cities to move away from oligarchic government to absolute, dynastic rule.

The plot intended to murder the chief patricians on 15 April and proclaim Faliero prince of Venice. It was badly organised, with poor communication between the conspirators, and was quickly discovered thanks to some of the conspirators having made revelations. The Council of Ten proceeded to arrest the ringleaders and to place armed guards all over the town. Several of the conspirators were condemned to death and others to various terms of imprisonment. Faliero pleaded guilty to all charges and was beheaded on 17 April and his body mutilated. Ten additional ringleaders were hanged on display from the Doge&#x27;s Palace in Piazza San Marco.

== Legacy ==
Faliero was condemned to &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;, and accordingly his portrait displayed in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) in the Doge&#x27;s Palace was omitted and the space painted over with a black shroud, which can still be seen in the hall today. A Latin language inscription on the painted shroud reads: &quot;Hic est locus Marini Faletro decapitati pro criminibus&quot; (&quot;This is the space for Marino Faliero, beheaded for his crimes&quot;).

The story of Faliero&#x27;s failed plot was later made into plays by Lord Byron (&quot;Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice&quot; in 1821) and Casimir Delavigne (in 1829). Delavigne&#x27;s play was adapted into an eponymous opera scored by Gaetano Donizetti in 1835. All three present the traditional story that Faliero was acting to defend his wife&#x27;s honour. Prussian author E. T. A. Hoffmann used a different approach in his 1818 novella &quot;&quot;; German composer Robert Schumann contemplated writing an opera based on Hoffmann&#x27;s story. Eugène Delacroix&#x27;s 1826 painting &quot;The Execution of the Doge Marino Faliero&quot; is based on Lord Byron&#x27;s play.

His home, Palazzo Falier, still exists in Venice, being one of the oldest structures there.

<text>Davao de Oro, officially the Province of Davao de Oro (; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Davao Region in Mindanao. Its capital is Nabunturan while Monkayo is the most populous. It used to be part of the province of Davao del Norte until it was made a separate province in 1998.

The province borders Davao del Norte to the west, Agusan del Sur to the north, and Davao Oriental to the east. To the southwest lies the Davao Gulf. The first elected governor was Jose Caballero, formerly a lawyer for a mining group in the province. It was formerly known as Compostela Valley (shortened to ComVal; ) from its inception until December 2019, when a plebiscite ratified the law that proposed to rename the province to Davao de Oro.

==History==


Davao de Oro, the 78th province in the country, was created out of Davao del Norte Province by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 8470&quot;, signed by President Fidel V. Ramos on January 30, 1998. The new province was officially named Compostela Valley. On March 7 of the same year, the law was ratified through a plebiscite conducted in the eleven (11) municipalities of the mother province.

The movement to create a new province by dividing Davao del Norte started in the 1980s during the time of Congressman Lorenzo S. Sarmiento Sr., himself the author of RA No. 6430. However, this was not realized until his death in the late 1980s. His son, Rogelio M. Sarmiento, who became his successor in Congress, pushed for the passage of the bill creating the province.

Upon consultation with the governor of Davao del Norte, Prospero S. Amatong, the province&#x27;s other two legislators, 3rd District Congressman Rodolfo P. Del Rosario and 2nd District Congressman Baltazar A. Sator, and other provincial and municipal officials, it was decided that the addition of four municipalities, namely Maco, Mabini, Pantukan, and Laak to the proposed province would be the most ideal and equitable configuration as this would make both provinces on an almost equal footing in terms of area, population, and development opportunities. It was also decided that Nabunturan would be the capital town because of its more central location.

The name originally proposed for the province was &quot;Davao del Norte&quot;, the former name, or so it was thought, of the mother province. However, the House of Representatives’ Reference and Research Bureau, which conducted the research and legal work on the creation of the province, found out that the mother province continues to be officially referred to as &quot;Davao del Norte&quot; in most official documents including the 1987 Philippine Constitution despite the passage of &quot;RA No. 6430&quot; on June 17, 1972, renaming it as &quot;Davao Province&quot;. Tedious technical and legal issues needed to be resolved before the name could be adopted. The proposal was thus shelved and the name finally agreed upon was &quot;Compostela Valley&quot;, referring to the great fertile plain in the heartland of the province.

The origin of the province’s inhabitants came from the ethnic tribes of the Mansaka, Mandaya, Manobo, Mangguangan, Dibabawon, Aeta, Kamayo, Davaweño and Kalagan. Similar to the history of other Mindanao provinces, most of the present populations of the province are descendants of migrants who came from Luzon and Visayas islands during the pre-war and post war eras, among the Luzon migrants were Tagalogs from Bataan (thus, the town New Bataan) &amp; Ilocanos from North Central Luzon. The bigger wave of immigrants came during the time of President Ramon Magsaysay wherein the policy of attraction adopted by the national government was to offer parcels of land to tenant-farmers. Although a virtual melting pot, the Visayans (mostly Cebuano-speaking) are the dominant group in Davao de Oro.

Upon its establishment, Davao de Oro was ruled by a succession of three governors during the first four months of its existence. The first governor of the province was Prospero S. Amatong, the three-term governor (1986-1998) of the then undivided province of Davao del Norte, who held the position only for a day. As the law creating the new province allowed incumbent elected officials of Davao del Norte the option to serve the remainder of their term in Compostela Valley, Amatong took this option and assumed the governorship of the then-Compostela Valley on March 26, 1998. The following day, he resigned and filed his candidacy for the congressional seat of the 2nd district of the new province. The governorship was turned over to Luz M. Sarmiento, by virtue of a presidential appointment. Sarmiento, the wife of then Congressman Lorenzo S. Sarmiento Sr. served the province from March 27, 1998, to June 30, 1998. She was succeeded by Jose R. Caballero.

Jose R. Caballero, a practicing lawyer and former vice governor of then undivided Davao del Norte (1988-1992) was the first elected governor of Compostela Valley.

Arturo T. &quot;Chiongkee&quot; Uy is the fourth governor of Compostela Valley. He first served the province as member of the 3rd Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Compostela Valley (2004-2007) before he was elected as governor in the May 2007 national and local elections. He was reelected unopposed during the May 2010 national and local elections.

In 1955, the barrio (barangay) of New Sabonga was transferred to the municipality of Compostela from the municipality of Asuncion.

On June 23, 1957, then President Carlos P. Garcia signed Republic Act No. 2038 which separated Compostela from Nabunturan. The first Mayor appointed by President Carlos P. Garcia was then Mayor Pio P. Galenzoga, one of the pioneer settlers.

In the same year the sitios of Kao, Magkagong, Margosan, Matilo, Magangit, Cabacungan, Tigbatinao and Camanlangan were constituted into a barrio known as Santo Niño.

At the time, Compostela was an incongruous mixture of wooden-roofed houses concentrated along the Agusan River which was properly known as &quot;dungguanan&quot; (embarkation). This area later became its center of trade and commerce or Poblacion.

===Change of name===

A Senate bill officially renaming Compostela Valley to &quot;Davao de Oro&quot; was passed in 2019. Provincial officials led by Governor Jayvee Tyron Uy justified the renaming as part of an clear up confusion with its geographic location, with the province&#x27;s name sometimes associated with Cagayan Valley and the town of Compostela in Cebu, and associate it further with fellow provinces in the Davao Region. The plebiscite was held on December 7, 2019, with the majority of participants voting in favor of the name change.

Arnold Bajo is the most successful defender of the poor minorities, especially the Mandayas. He died in a battle while defending the poor. According to legends, 40 days after his death, his bodily spirit was infused into the statue of Ara-Araba, the local tribe&#x27;s god of harvest. From then on, he was worshipped as a god by the members of the Mandaya tribe.

<text>The bottlenose dolphin is a toothed whale in the genus Tursiops. They are common, cosmopolitan members of the family Delphinidae, the family of oceanic dolphins. Molecular studies show the genus contains three species: the common bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;), the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops aduncus&quot;), and Tamanend&#x27;s bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops erebennus&quot;). Others, like the Burrunan dolphin (&quot;Tursiops (aduncus) australis&quot;), may be alternately considered their own species or be subspecies of &quot;T. aduncus&quot;. Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide, being found everywhere except for the Arctic and Antarctic Circle regions. Their name derives from the Latin &quot;tursio&quot; (dolphin) and &quot;truncatus&quot; for the truncated teeth (the type specimen was old and had worn down teeth; this is not a typical characteristic of most members of the species).

Numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted, examining mimicry, use of artificial language, object categorization, and self-recognition. They can use tools (sponging; using marine sponges to forage for food sources they normally could not access) and transmit cultural knowledge from generation to generation, and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans. Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from aquarium shows and television programs such as &quot;Flipper&quot;. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps.

Common bottlenose dolphins have an encephalization quotient of 5.26, which is even higher than chimpanzees. This more than likely contributes to their high intelligence.

==Taxonomy==
Scientists have been long aware of the fact that the &quot;Tursiops&quot; dolphins might consist of more than one species, as there is extensive variation in color and morphology along its range. In the past, most studies used morphology to evaluate differences between and within species, but in the late 20th century, combining morphological and molecular genetics allowed much greater insight into this previously intractable problem. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, most researchers acknowledged the existence of two species: the common bottlenose dolphin (&quot;T. truncatus&quot;), found in coastal and oceanic habitats of most tropical to temperate oceans, and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (&quot;T. aduncus&quot;), that lives in coastal waters around India, northern Australia, South China, the Red Sea, and the eastern coast of Africa.

In 2011, a third distinct species was described, the Burrunan dolphin (&quot;T. (aduncus) australis&quot;), found in the Port Phillip and Gippsland Lakes areas of Victoria, Australia, after research showed it was distinct from &quot;T. truncatus&quot; and &quot;T. aduncus&quot;, both in morphology and genetics. Also, evidence has been accumulating to validate the existence of a separate species, Lahille&#x27;s bottlenose dolphin, &quot;T. gephyreus&quot;, that occurs in coastal waters of Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil. Other sources accept the Pacific bottlenose dolphin (&quot;T. t. gillii&quot; or &quot;T. gillii&quot;), that inhabits the Pacific, and has a black line from the eye to the forehead. &quot;T. gillii&quot;, first described in 1873, is currently considered a junior synonym of &quot;T. truncatus&quot;. Additionally, &quot;T. nuuanu&quot; was described in 1911 for bottlenose dolphins along the Pacific coast in Central America. An analysis of &quot;T. gillii&quot; and &quot;T. nuuanu&quot; specimens supported &quot;T. gillii&quot; as a synonym of &quot;T. truncatus&quot;, while &quot;T. nuuanu&quot; was recognized as a subspecies. In general, genetic variation between populations is significant, even among nearby populations. As a result of this genetic variation, other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common bottlenose dolphin are possible.

Much of the discussion and doubts about its taxonomy is related to the existence of two ecotypes of bottlenose dolphins in many part of its distribution. For example, the two ecotypes of the common bottlenose dolphin within the western North Atlantic are represented by the shallower water or coastal ecotype and the more offshore ecotype. Their ranges overlap, but they have been shown to be genetically distinct. In 2022, Costa et al. established morphologic, genetic, and evolutionary divergence between the two ecotypes in the western North Atlantic, resurrecting &quot;Tursiops erebennus&quot; for the coastal form while the offshore form was retained in &quot;T. truncatus&quot;.

The Society for Marine Mammalogy&#x27;s Committee on Taxonomy presently recognizes three species of bottlenose dolphin: &quot;T. truncatus&quot;, &quot;T. aduncus&quot;, and &quot;T. erebennus&quot;. They also recognize three subspecies of common bottlenose dolphin in addition to the nominotypical subspecies: the Black Sea bottlenose dolphin (&quot;T. t. ponticus&quot;), Lahille&#x27;s bottlenose dolphin (&quot;T. t. gephyreus&quot;), and the Eastern Tropical Pacific bottlenose dolphin (&quot;T. t. nuuanu&quot;). The IUCN, on their Red List of endangered species, currently recognises only two species of bottlenose dolphins. The American Society of Mammalogists also recognizes only two species. While acknowledging the studies describing &quot;T. australis&quot;, it classifies it within &quot;T. aduncus&quot;.

Some recent genetic evidence suggests the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin belongs in the genus &quot;Stenella&quot;, since it is more like the Atlantic spotted dolphin (&quot;Stenella frontalis&quot;) than the common bottlenose dolphin. However, more recent studies indicate that this is a consequence of reticulate evolution (such as past hybridization between &quot;Stenella&quot; and ancestral &quot;Tursiops&quot;) and incomplete lineage sorting, and thus support &quot;T&quot;. &quot;truncatus&quot; and &quot;T. aduncus&quot; belonging to the same genus.
===Hybrids===
Bottlenose dolphins have been known to hybridize with other dolphin species. Hybrids with Risso&#x27;s dolphin occur both in the wild and in captivity. The best known hybrid is the wholphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wholphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wholphins also exist in the wild. In captivity, a bottlenose dolphin and a rough-toothed dolphin hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid.

===Fossil species===
Bottlenose dolphins appeared during the Miocene. Known fossil species include &quot;Tursiops osennae&quot; (late Miocene to early Pliocene) from the Piacenzian coastal mudstone, and &quot;Tursiops miocaenus&quot; (Miocene) from the Burdigalian marine sandstone, all in Italy.

==Description==
The bottlenose dolphin weighs an average of , but can range from . It can reach a length of just over . Its color varies considerably, is usually dark gray on the back and lighter gray on the flanks, but it can be bluish-grey, brownish-grey, or even nearly black, and is often darker on the back from the rostrum to behind the dorsal fin. This is called countershading and is a form of camouflage. Older dolphins sometimes have a few spots.

Bottlenose dolphins can live for more than 40 years. Females typically live 5–10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years. This extreme age is rare and less than 2% of all Bottlenose dolphins will live longer than 60 years. Bottlenose dolphins can jump to a height of 6 metres (20 feet) in the air.

==Anatomy==

Their elongated upper and lower jaws form what is called a rostrum, or snout, which gives the animal its common name. The real, functional nose is the blowhole on top of its head; the nasal septum is visible when the blowhole is open.
Bottlenose dolphins have 18 to 28 conical teeth on each side of each jaw.

The flukes (lobes of the tail) and dorsal fin are formed of dense connective tissue and do not contain bone or muscle. The dorsal fin usually shows phenotypic variations that help discriminate among populations. The animal propels itself by moving the flukes up and down. The pectoral flippers (at the sides of the body) are for steering; they contain bones homologous to the forelimbs of land mammals. A bottlenose dolphin discovered in Japan has two additional pectoral fins, or &quot;hind legs&quot;, at the tail, about the size of a human&#x27;s pair of hands. Scientists believe a mutation caused the ancient trait to reassert itself as a form of atavism.

==Physiology and senses==

In colder waters, they have more body fat and blood, and are more suited to deeper diving. Typically, 18%–20% of their body weight is blubber. Most research in this area has been restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean. Bottlenose dolphins typically swim at , but are capable of bursts of up to . The higher speeds can only be sustained for a short time.

===Senses===
The dolphin&#x27;s search for food is aided by a form of sonar known as echolocation: it locates objects by producing sounds and listening for the echoes. Clicking sounds are emitted in a focused beam in front of the dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object. To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with bats and sonar, which reduce the sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click&#x27;s echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers. Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an &quot;echoic image&quot; or sound picture of their targets.

They also have electroreception. The calves are born with two slender rows of whiskers along their snout, which fall off soon after birth, leaving behind a series of dimples known as vibrissal pits able to sense electric fields.

Dolphins have sharp eyesight. The eyes are located at the sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum, or reflecting membrane, at the back of the retina, which aids vision in dim light. Their horseshoe-shaped, double-slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater, despite the different indices of refraction of these media. When under water, the eyeball&#x27;s lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).

By contrast, a bottlenose&#x27;s sense of smell is poor, because its blowhole, the analog to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. Like other toothed whales, it has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but this has not been well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference.

In 2022, a study at the University of St Andrews in Scotland found that dolphins were able to identify their &quot;friends&quot; and family members by the taste of their urine in the water.

===Communication===
Bottlenose dolphins communicate through burst pulsed sounds, whistles, and body language. Examples of body language include leaping out of the water, snapping jaws, slapping the tail on the surface and butting heads.
Sounds and gestures help keep track of other dolphins in the group, and alert other dolphins to danger and nearby food. Lacking vocal cords, they produce sounds using six air sacs near their blow hole. Each animal has a uniquely identifying, frequency-modulated narrow-band signature vocalization (signature whistle).

Signature whistles, which are in a higher frequency range than humans can hear, have an important role in facilitating mother–calf contact. In the Sarasota Dolphin Research Program&#x27;s library of recordings were 19 female common bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;) producing signature whistles both with and without the presence of their dependent calf. In all 19 cases, the mother dolphin changed the same signature whistle when the calf was present, by reaching a higher frequency, or using a wider frequency range. Similarly, humans use higher fundamental frequencies and a wider pitch range to inflect child–directed speech (CDS). This has rarely been discovered in other species. The researchers stated that CDS benefits for humans are cueing the child to pay attention, long-term bonding, and promoting the development of lifelong vocal learning, with parallels in these bottlenose dolphins in an example of convergent evolution.

Researchers from the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute (BDRI), based in Sardinia (Italy) have now shown whistles and burst pulsed sounds are vital to the animals&#x27; social life and mirror their behaviors.

The tonal whistle sounds (the most melodious ones) allow dolphins to stay in contact with each other (above all, mothers and offspring), and to coordinate hunting strategies.
The burst-pulsed sounds (which are more complex and varied than the whistles) are used &quot;to avoid physical aggression in situations of high excitement&quot;, such as when they are competing for the same piece of food, for example. The dolphins emit these strident sounds when in the presence of other individuals moving towards the same prey. The &quot;least dominant&quot; one soon moves away to avoid confrontation.

Other communication uses about 30 distinguishable sounds, and although famously proposed by John C. Lilly in the 1950s, no &quot;dolphin language&quot; has been found. However, Herman, Richards, and Wolz demonstrated comprehension of an artificial language by two bottlenose dolphins (named Akeakamai and Phoenix) in the period of skepticism toward animal language following Herbert Terrace&#x27;s critique.

==Intelligence==

===Cognition===
Cognitive abilities that have been investigated include concept formation, sensory skills, and mental representations. Such research has been ongoing since the 1970s. This includes: acoustic and behavioral mimicry, comprehension of novel sequences in an artificial language, memory, monitoring of self behavior, discrimination and matching, comprehension of symbols for various body parts, comprehension of pointing gestures and gaze (as made by dolphins or humans), mirror self-recognition, and numerical values.

===Tool use and culture===

At least some wild bottlenose dolphins use tools. In Shark Bay, off Western Australia, dolphins place a marine sponge on their rostrum, presumably to protect it when searching for food on the sandy sea bottom. This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).

Mud plume feeding is a feeding technique performed by a small community of bottlenose dolphins over shallow seagrass beds (less than 1 m) in the Florida Keys in the United States. The behavior involves creation of a U-shaped plume of mud in the water column and then rushing through the plume to capture fish.

Along the beaches and tidal marshes of South Carolina and Georgia in the United States, bottlenose dolphins cooperatively herd prey fish onto steep and sandy banks in a practice known as &quot;strand feeding&quot;. Groups of between two and six dolphins are regularly observed creating a bow wave to force the fish out of the water. The dolphins follow the fish, stranding themselves briefly, to eat their prey before twisting their bodies back and forth in order to slide back into the water. While initially documented in South Carolina and Georgia, strand feeding has also been observed in Louisiana, Texas, Baja California, Ecuador, and Australia.

Some Mauritanian dolphins cooperate with human fishermen. The dolphins drive a school of fish towards the shore, where humans await with nets. In the confusion of casting nets, the dolphins catch a large number of fish as well. Intraspecies cooperative foraging has also been observed. These behaviors may also be transmitted via teaching. Controversially, Rendell and Whitehead have proposed a structure for the study of cetacean culture. Similar cases have been observed in Laguna, Santa Catarina in Brazil since during 19th century as well.

Near Adelaide, in South Australia, several bottlenose dolphins &quot;tail-walk&quot;, whereby they elevate the upper part of their bodies vertically out of the water, and propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins copied it from her, and the behaviour has continued through generations until 2022.

A study conducted by the University of Chicago showed that bottlenose dolphins can remember whistles of other dolphins they had lived with after 20 years of separation. Each dolphin has a unique whistle that functions like a name, allowing the marine mammals to keep close social bonds. The new research shows that dolphins have the longest memory yet known in any species other than humans.

The bottlenose dolphins of John&#x27;s Pass in Boca Ciega Bay, St. Petersburg, Florida, exhibit a rare form of self-decoration and social object use called grass-wearing. Self-decoration by wearing grass appears to be an attention-getting device rather than purely play and varies from a single blade to large clusters of grass. John&#x27;s Pass dolphins self-decorate with grass primarily when they form new social groups or engage in procreative activities. Grass-wearing behavior among these dolphins is a local behavioral tradition that could constitute a cultural difference from other communities.

===Cortical neurons===
Some researchers hypothesize that the number of nerve cells (neurons) in the cortex of the brain predicts intelligence in mammals. A 2019 study estimated the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex of three common bottlenose dolphins and found numbers ranging from 11.7 to 15.2 billion neurons. The human average being approximately 16 billion, this is likely within the range found in the human population.

==Life history==
Bottlenose dolphins have a lifespan of 40–60 years. Females can outlive males and live for 60 years or more. Dolphins start to reproduce aged 5 to 15 years.

===Respiration and sleep===
The bottlenose dolphin has a single blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The bottlenose dolphin typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole two to three times per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.

Dolphins can breathe while &quot;half-asleep&quot;. During the sleeping cycle, one brain hemisphere remains active, while the other hemisphere shuts down. The active hemisphere handles surfacing and breathing behavior. The daily sleeping cycle lasts for about 8 hours, in increments of minutes to hours. During the sleeping cycle, they remain near the surface, swimming slowly or &quot;logging&quot;, and occasionally closing one eye.

===Reproduction===
Both sexes have genital slits on the underside of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female&#x27;s slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one on each side of the genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor&#x27;s sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.

During the breeding season, males compete for access to females. Such competition can take the form of fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males. Male Sarasota Bay common bottlenose dolphins with the defensive advantages of male pair-bonding range more widely than unpaired males, and encounter more unrelated females.

In Shark Bay, male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins have been observed working in pairs or larger groups to follow and/or restrict the movement of a female for weeks at a time, waiting for her to become sexually receptive. These coalitions, also known as male reproductive alliances, will fight with other coalitions for control of females. Humans and bottlenose dolphins are the only species that share this type of &quot;gang formation&quot; habit as a form of cooperation.

Mating occurs belly to belly. Dolphins have been observed engaging in intercourse when the females are not in their estrous cycles and cannot produce young, suggesting they may mate for pleasure. The gestation period averages 12 months. Births can occur at any time of year, although peaks occur in warmer months. The young are born in shallow water, sometimes assisted by a (possibly male) &quot;midwife&quot;, and usually only a single calf is born. Twins are possible, but rare. Newborn bottlenose dolphins are long and weigh , with Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin infants being generally smaller than common bottlenose dolphin infants. To accelerate nursing, the mother can eject milk from her mammary glands. The calf suckles for 18 months to up to 8 years, and continues to closely associate with its mother for several years after weaning. Females sexually mature at ages 5–13, males at ages 9–14. Females reproduce every two to six years. Reproduction is moderately seasonal (September–January), peaking from October to December. Calf loss between August and December is followed by rapid conception (1–2 months), whereas conception is delayed (2–9 months) if calf loss occurs between January and July. Weaning ages ranged from 2.7 to 8.0 years, but 66.7% (42 calves) were weaned by their fourth birthday. Females tended to wean mid-pregnancy. Group size was unrelated to water depth or female reproductive success, but reproductive success was predicted by water depth. Shallow water may allow mothers and calves to detect and avoid predatory sharks. Alternatively, or additionally, prey density may be higher in shallow water compared to deep water.

Georgetown University professor Janet Mann argues the strong personal behavior among male calves is about bond formation and benefits the species in an evolutionary context. She cites studies showing these dolphins as adults are inseparable, and that early bonds aid protection, as well as in locating females.

Female bottlenose dolphins have to expend additional energy in carrying out parental care, &quot;e.g.&quot;, infant-carrying behavior. Dolphins do not physically hold their infants but line up in an echelon position with infants swimming beside them. This position creates a change of water flow pattern from the infant which minimizes separation between the mother and infant, but also increases the mother&#x27;s surface area and creates a drag for the swimmer. This also leaves less energy to use in swimming speed, foraging, and predator evasion.

===Social interaction===

Adult males live mostly alone or in groups of two to three, and join pods for short periods of time. Adult females and young dolphins normally live in groups of up to 15 animals. Males give strong mutual support if other males help them, even if they are not friends. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis. Group compositions are usually determined by sex, age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In a dolphin community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adult females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes, and adult males either alone or in bonded pairs. Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000. The social strategies of marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins &quot;provide interesting parallels&quot; with the social strategies of elephants and chimpanzees.

Bottlenose dolphins studied by Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers off the island of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior does not depend on feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has been linked to a change in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area.

==Ecology==
===Feeding===
Fish is one of the main items in the dolphin diet. They also eat shrimps, squid, mollusks, and cuttlefish, and only swallow the soft parts. They eat 22 pounds of fish a day. When they encounter a shoal of fish, they work as a team to herd them towards the shore to maximize the harvest. They also hunt alone, often targeting bottom-dwelling species. The bottlenose dolphin sometimes hits a fish with its fluke, sometimes knocking it out of the water, using a strategy called &quot;fish whacking&quot;. &quot;Strand feeding&quot; is an inherited feeding technique used by bottlenose dolphins near and around coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. When a pod finds a school of fish, they will circle the school and trap the fish in a mini whirlpool. Then, the dolphins will charge at the school and push their bodies up onto a mud-flat, forcing the fish on the mud-flat, as well. The dolphins then crawl around on their sides, consuming the fish they washed up on shore. This happens only during low tides.

One type of feeding behavior seen in bottlenose dolphins is mud ring feeding.

Bottlenose dolphins conflict with small-scale coastal commercial fisheries in some Mediterranean areas. Common bottlenose dolphins are probably attracted to fishing nets because they offer a concentrated food source.

===Relations with other species===

Dolphins can exhibit altruistic behaviour toward other sea creatures. On Mahia Beach, New Zealand, on March 10, 2008, two pygmy sperm whales, a female and calf, stranded on the beach. Rescuers attempted to refloat them four times. Shortly, a playful bottlenose dolphin known to local residents as Moko arrived and, after apparently vocalizing at the whales, led them along a sandbar to the open sea, saving them from imminent euthanasia. In 2019 a female was observed caring for a juvenile melon-headed whale, the first reported instance of a bottlenose dolphin adopting a non-conspecific infant.

The bottlenose dolphin can behave aggressively. Males fight for rank and access to females. During mating season, males compete vigorously with each other through displays of toughness and size, with a series of acts, such as head-butting. They display aggression towards sharks and smaller dolphin species. At least one population, off Scotland, has practiced infanticide, and also has attacked and killed harbour porpoises. University of Aberdeen researchers say the dolphins do not eat their victims, but are simply competing for food. However, Dr. Read of Duke University, a porpoise expert researching similar cases of porpoise killings that had occurred in Virginia in 1996 and 1997, holds a different view. He states dolphins and porpoises feed on different types of fish, thus food competition is an unlikely cause of the killings. Similar behaviour has been observed in Ireland. In the first half of July 2014, four attacks with three porpoise fatalities were observed and caught on video by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre in the Cardigan Bay, Wales.

The bottlenose dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger species, such as the short-finned pilot whale, the false killer whale and Risso&#x27;s dolphin. They also interact with smaller species, such as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough-toothed dolphin. While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative, they can also be hostile.

===Predators===
Some large shark species, such as the tiger shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the bottlenose dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin &#x27;mobbing&#x27; behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.

The species sometimes shows curiosity towards humans in or near water. Occasionally, they rescue injured divers by raising them to the surface. They also do this to help injured members of their own species. In November 2004, a dramatic report of dolphin intervention came from New Zealand. Four lifeguards, swimming off the coast near Whangārei, were approached by a shark (reportedly a great white shark). Bottlenose dolphins herded the swimmers together and surrounded them for 40 minutes, preventing the shark from attacking, as they slowly swam to shore.

In coastal regions, dolphins run the risk of colliding with boats. Researchers of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute first quantified data about solitary bottlenose dolphin diving behavior in the presence and absence of boats. Dolphins responded more to tourist than fishing vessels. Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affected dolphin safety.

However, dolphins in these areas can also coexist with humans. For example, in the town of Laguna in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins resides in the estuary, and some of its members cooperate with humans. These cooperating dolphins are individually recognized by the local fishermen, who name them. The fishermen typically stand up to their knees in the shallow waters or sit in canoes, waiting for the dolphins. Now and then, one or more dolphins appear, driving the fish towards the line of fishermen. One dolphin then displays a unique body movement outside the water, which serves as a signal to the fishermen to cast their nets (the entire sequence is shown here, and a detailed description of the signal&#x27;s characteristics is available here). In this unique form of cooperation, the dolphins gain because the fish are disoriented and because the fish cannot escape to shallow water where the larger dolphins cannot swim. Likewise, studies show that fishermen casting their nets following the unique signal catch more fish than when fishing alone, without the help of the dolphins. The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration began before 1847. Similar cooperative fisheries also exist in Mauritania, Africa.

Commercial &#x27;dolphin encounter&#x27; enterprises and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film &quot;The Cove&quot; documents how dolphins are captured and sold to some of these enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists have claimed that the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld, counter by claiming that the dolphins are properly cared for, have much environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.

Eight bottlenose dolphins that lived at the Marine Life Aquarium in Gulfport, Mississippi were swept away from their aquarium pool during Hurricane Katrina. They were later found in the Gulf of Mexico and returned to captivity.
The military of the United States and Russia train bottlenose dolphins as military dolphins for wartime tasks, such as locating sea mines and detecting enemy divers. The U.S.&#x27;s program is the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, located in San Diego.

Tião was a well-known solitary male bottlenose dolphin that was first spotted in the town of São Sebastião in Brazil around 1994 and frequently allowed humans to interact with him. The dolphin became infamous for killing a swimmer and injuring many others, which later earned him the nickname &quot;Killer Dolphin&quot;.

===Cultural influence===
The popular television show &quot;Flipper&quot;, created by Ivan Tors, portrayed a bottlenose dolphin in a friendly relationship with two boys, Sandy and Bud. A seagoing &quot;Lassie&quot;, Flipper understood English and was a hero: &quot;Go tell Dad we&#x27;re in trouble, Flipper! Hurry!&quot; The show&#x27;s theme song contains the lyric &quot;no one you see / is smarter than he&quot;. The television show was based on a 1963 film, with a sequel, Flipper&#x27;s New Adventure (1964), and was remade as a feature film in 1996, starring Elijah Wood and Paul Hogan, as well as a second TV series running from 1995 to 2000, starring Jessica Alba.

Other television appearances by bottlenose dolphins include &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Dolphin Cove&quot;, &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;, and &quot;The Penguins of Madagascar&quot;, in which a dolphin, Doctor Blowhole, is a villain. In the HBO movie &quot;Zeus and Roxanne&quot;, a female bottlenose dolphin befriends a male dog, and in &quot;Secrets of the Bermuda Triangle&quot; (1996 Ian Toynton movie), a girl named Annie (played by Lisa Jakub) swims with dolphins. Human and dolphin interaction segments, shot on location in the Florida Keys with Dolphin Research Center, are featured on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and on a Halloween episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Treehouse of Horror XI.

&quot;Dolphin Tale&quot;, directed by Charles Martin Smith, starring Nathan Gamble, Ashley Judd, Harry Connick Jr., Morgan Freeman, Cozi Zuehlsdorff and Kris Kristofferson, is based on the real-life story of the dolphin Winter, who was rescued from a crab trap in December 2005 and lost her tail, but learned to swim with a prosthetic one. &quot;Dolphin Tale 2&quot;, a sequel to the 2011 film, featured another rescued dolphin named Hope and an appearance by Bethany Hamilton. The sequel was released on September 12, 2014. The NFL&#x27;s Miami Dolphins uses the bottlenose dolphin as its mascot and team logo. Factual descriptions of the dolphins date back into antiquity — the writings of Aristotle, Oppian and Pliny the Elder all mention the species.

===Threats===

Between 1950 and 2020, about four million of dolphins have drowned in fishing nets. Tuna fishing crews have been the most responsible for the largest number of deaths. In 1972, the U.S. government passed a law limiting the number of dolphins that could be killed yearly by tuna fishing crews. Dolphins in the United Kingdom have also been found to contain high levels of pollutants in their tissues. Heavy metals including mercury, PCBs and DDT are of great concern. These pollutants can cause harm in dolphins growth development, reproduction, and immunity. Since the mid-1990s, hundreds of dolphins have been trained to perform in shows presented by aquariums, zoos, and amusement parks. Scientists conduct various types of research to understand the dolphin&#x27;s communication system.

The man-made chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) may be compromising the immune system of bottlenose dolphins. PFOS affects the immune system of male mice at a concentration of 91.5 ppb, while PFOS has been reported in bottlenose dolphins in excess of 1 ppm. High levels of metal contaminants have been measured in tissues in many areas of the globe. A recent study found high levels of cadmium and mercury in bottlenose dolphins from South Australia, levels which were later found to be associated with kidney malformations, indicating possible health effects of high heavy metal concentrations in dolphins.

===Conservation===

Bottlenose dolphins are not endangered. Their future is stable because of their abundance and adaptability. However, specific populations are threatened due to various environmental changes. The population in the Moray Firth in Scotland is estimated to consist of around 190 individuals, and are under threat from harassment, traumatic injury, water pollution and reduction in food availability. Likewise, an isolated population in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, is in decline due to calf loss coincident to an increase in warm freshwater discharge into the fiord. Less local climate change, such as increasing water temperature may also play a role but has never been shown to be the case. One of the largest coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia was forecast to be stable with little variation in mortality over time (Manlik &quot;et al.&quot; 2016).

In United States waters, hunting and harassing of marine mammals is forbidden in almost all circumstances, from passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.

<text>Joseph Arthur Rank, 1st Baron Rank (22/23 December 1888 – 29 March 1972) was an English industrialist who was head and founder of The Rank Organisation.

== Family business ==

Rank was born on 22 or 23 December 1888 at Kingston upon Hull in England into a Victorian family environment, which was dominated by his father Joseph Rank who had built a substantial flour milling business. He was educated at The Leys School in Cambridge. Joseph is reported to have told his son Arthur that he was &quot;a dunce at school&quot; and that the only way that he could succeed in life would be in his father&#x27;s flour mill. 

J. Arthur ventured on his own with Peterkins Self-Raising Flour, but when that business failed he returned to work for his father. That was the business (Joseph Rank Limited) that he later inherited and which became known as Rank Hovis McDougall (now owned by British food conglomerate Premier Foods).

== Religious challenge ==
Rank was a devout member of the Methodists and in his middle age he taught at Sunday School to which he began to show religious films. This practice expanded to other churches and schools and it led to his formation of the Religious Film Society in 1933 to which he then distributed films that he had also made. His first production was called &quot;Mastership&quot;.

When the &quot;Methodist Times&quot; newspaper began to complain about the negative influence that British and American films shown in Britain were having on family life, their editorial was answered by the London &quot;Evening News&quot; who suggested that instead of complaining, the Methodist Church should provide a solution. Rank took up the challenge and via an introduction by a young film producer named John Corfield, he discussed both the problem and a solution with Lady Yule of Bricket Wood. The net result of these meetings was the formation of the British National Films Company.

The first commercial production by this company was &quot;Turn of the Tide&quot; (1935), a film based upon a 1932 novel by Leo Walmsley called &quot;Three Fevers&quot;. Having created their film, British National then had to get it distributed and exhibited, but this proved to be more difficult. Some commercial screens began showing &quot;Turn of the Tide&quot; as a second feature, but this was not enough exposure for the company to make a profit.

== Pinewood Film Studios ==

Having first created a film production company and having made a movie at another studio, Rank, Lady Yule and John Corfield began talking to Charles Boot who had recently bought the estate of Heatherden Hall at Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, for the purpose of turning it into a movie studio that would rival those in Hollywood.

In 1935, the trio became owner-operators of Pinewood Film Studios. Lady Yule later sold her shares to Rank while John Corfield resigned from its board of directors.

== Commercial challenge ==
The problems encountered in the distribution of &quot;Turn of the Tide&quot; were addressed when Rank discovered that the people who controlled the British film industry had ties to the American movie industry and that for all practical purposes he was shut out of his own domestic market. American films occupied 80% of British screen time during the era before World War II.

In 1935 Rank arrived at a solution to his distribution problems. Because the middlemen controlled the distribution pipeline from production to exhibition, he decided to buy a large part of both the distribution and exhibition systems. He began by forming a partnership with film maker C. M. Woolf to form General Film Distributors, which in 1936 was incorporated in Rank&#x27;s General Cinema Finance Corporation but continued to handle all distribution for the Rank organisation until 1955, when it was renamed J. Arthur Rank Film Distributors.

== Rank Organisation ==

In 1939 Rank consolidated his film production interests in both the Pinewood Film Studios and the Denham Film Studios. In 1938 Rank bought the Odeon Cinemas chain and the Amalgamated Studios in Borehamwood, although the latter were never used as film studios by Rank. In 1941, it absorbed Gaumont-British, which owned 251 cinemas, and the Lime Grove Studios (later bought by BBC Television) and acquired the Paramount Cinemas chain, so that by 1942 the Rank Organisation owned 619 cinemas. Other interests were acquired (such as the Bush Radio company in 1949) which would be added to the interests in a few more years) within a new company called the Rank Organisation. Rank retired as Chairman in 1962 and was succeeded by John Davis, who had been Managing Director since 1948.

It was then that Rank developed the special prism needed to make the Sodium Vapour Process of film matte special effects technique work. This analogue method used amber light to mask images so they could be placed over a different background. The prism caused light to be split into two beams where two film strips would record the same image on both black &amp; white and colour film. There were only three of these prisms ever made and were licensed by Rank for use by Walt Disney Studios. This process was first used for the 1964 film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; since it had superior colour and blur allowances. The last known film to use this process was &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990).

== Films ==
During the 1940s, the companies Rank controlled produced some of the finest British films of the period, including: &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943), &quot;Henry V&quot; (1944), &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946), &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947), and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948). From the 1950s, fewer adventurous film projects were attempted and Rank concentrated on producing solidly commercial ventures, mainly aimed at the family market. These include the popular Norman Wisdom comedies and the &quot;Doctor...&quot; films. However some more serious films were produced during this era including: &quot;Carve Her Name With Pride&quot; (1958), &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; (also 1958) and &quot;Victim&quot; (1961), as well as a clutch of prestige topics such as the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 and filmed performances by The Royal Ballet.

== Core interests and legacy==
Although his critics claimed that many of the films that he had produced under the name of Rank were not exactly in keeping with his original intention of producing &quot;family-friendly&quot; films (which John Davis had said was company policy) to challenge American competition, he nevertheless kept to his core beliefs. To that end in 1953 he set up the J. Arthur Rank Group Charity to promote Christian belief. The charity later became known as The Rank Foundation. He was a governor of The Peckham Experiment in 1949.

In 1957, J. Arthur Rank was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as The 1st Baron Rank, of Sutton Scotney in the County of Southampton (Sutton Scotney is a small village between Andover and Winchester in Hampshire).

===Rank Foundation and prizes===

Rank and his wife were philanthropists who performed a lot of charitable work, and in 1953 they founded the J. Arthur Rank Group Charity, now The Rank Foundation. The Foundation continues to support activities which encourage, develop and support young people, and other disadvantaged groups. It also supports activities promoting Christian principles through media such as film. there are three chairpersons of the organisation: Rank&#x27;s son-in-law, Robin Cowen, and his grandsons Fred Packard and Joey Newton.

Donations were made from The Rank Foundation to endow The Rank Prize Funds, established shortly before Rank&#x27;s death, on 16 February 1972. The two Funds, the Human and Animal Nutrition and Crop Husbandry Fund and the Optoelectronics Fund, support sciences reflecting Rank&#x27;s business interests through his &quot;connection with the flour-milling and cinema and electronics industries&quot;, and also because Rank believed that they would be of great benefit to humanity. There are two Rank Prizes, and the Funds also recognise, support and foster excellence among young people in the two fields of nutrition and optoelectronics. The Rank Prize for Optoelectronics supports, encourages, and rewards researchers working at the cutting edge of optoelectronics research, initially (from 1976) awarded annually, now a prize worth £30,000. The Rank Prize for Nutrition was awarded at various intervals since 1976, but now also awarded biennially, and worth £40,000.

The Arthur Rank Centre was founded in 1972 with the support of the Rank Foundation to provide resources, training, and advocacy for rural Christians, rural churches and the communities they serve, across England and Wales.

===Rank Fellowship===
Inspired by his personal knowledge of the Brazilian Fundação Estudar, the Rank Fellowship was created in 2003 by Rank&#x27;s eldest grandson, Fred Arthur Rank Packard, who became Chairman of the Rank Foundation in 2000. Fred was one of the founders of the Brazilian investment banking firm Banco Garantia, along with Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicuperia.

==Family==
Rank married Nell (1890–1971), and they had two daughters, Shelagh (who was married first to Fred Packard who lived in Hollywood, and then to Robin Cowen) and Ursula (born 1920). When he died in March 1972, aged 83, his barony became extinct.

==In popular culture==
J. Arthur Rank&#x27;s name was parodied on the PBS children&#x27;s educational TV show &quot;The Electric Company&quot; as &quot;J. Arthur Crank&quot; (voiced and later performed by Jim Boyd), a character wearing a plaid shirt, suspenders and a porkpie hat, who was in a perpetually cranky mood (hence his name) whenever he interrupted sketches to complain when spellings or pronunciations confused him or when he was mistaken for someone else.

&quot;J. Arthur Rank&quot; has also been used as cockney rhyming slang, both for &quot;bank&quot; and &quot;wank&quot; (slang for masturbation), typically shortened to &quot;J. Arthur&quot; or just &quot;Arthur&quot;. In golf, especially in the United Kingdom, a &quot;J. Arthur&quot; is slang for a shank.

<text>Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost is a 2000 British musical romantic comedy film written, directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, based on the comic play of the same name by William Shakespeare. The first feature film to be made of this lesser-known comedy, Branagh&#x27;s fourth film of a Shakespeare play was a box-office and critical disappointment.

The cast includes Shakespearean veterans such as Timothy Spall, Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, alongside Hollywood actors Alicia Silverstone and Matthew Lillard and Broadway and West End stars such as Nathan Lane and Jimmy Yuill.

As a result of its poor commercial performance, Miramax shelved its three-picture deal with Branagh, who subsequently returned to Shakespeare with &quot;As You Like It&quot; in 2006.

==Plot==
The King of Navarre has vowed to avoid romantic entanglements to spend three years in study and contemplation. His chief courtiers agree to follow him in this vow, though one (Berowne) argues that they will not be able to fulfill this plan.

Berowne&#x27;s claim is proven correct almost instantly. The Princess of France comes to Navarre to discuss the status of the province of Aquitaine. Though the King does not grant them access to his palace (they are forced to camp outside), each of the courtiers falls in love with one of her handmaidens, and the King falls in love with the Princess herself.

The men attempt to hide their own loves and expose those of their fellows. After a masked ball in which the pairs of lovers are comically mismatched, all the amours are revealed. Costard leads a musical number with the King&#x27;s court, which eventually includes the entire cast. But as the song closes, a messenger arrives with news of the King of France&#x27;s death. As the year of mourning that will proceed for the princess and her ladies means further courtship is impossible, and the women had until this point treated the men&#x27;s courtship as nothing but a mocking merriment to entertain their guests, they request demonstrations of humility and constancy from the men, with a promise to marry them at the end of the 12 months if they carry out these acts.

Newsreel footage shows the character&#x27;s lives over the course of that year, which takes place in the context of World War II. The montage ends with all those who survived the war (Boyet we specifically see die in some covert military action) reuniting in celebration on what appears to be VE Day.

The comic underplot of the original play, in which Costard and others attempt to stage a play (rather like that of the rude mechanicals in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;) is severely curtailed, as is the boasting of the Spaniard, Don Armado.

==Cast==
Some of the characters in the film adaptation are not in the original script. Gaston, Isabelle, Eugene, Jaques, Beatrice, Hyppolyte, Celimene, and Sophie are not mentioned in the play, and they have no lines in the film. This, however, is a standard feature of Branagh&#x27;s Shakespeare adaptations; his &quot;Hamlet&quot; contains many non-speaking walk-on roles that are not included in the original play, but are mentioned in the cast list.

==Production==

Branagh became interested in the play during his 1984 season with the Royal Shakespeare Company, when he had played the King of Navarre. From that period, he was familiar with Harley Granville-Barker&#x27;s famous essay arguing that &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; could be treated as highly stylised, with the dialogue and action treated with an almost musical sense of rhythm. Branagh took this insight a step further and turned the play into a musical, going much further in his adaptation of the play than he had ever done in his Shakespeare films, and risking the alienation of both audiences and serious critics. This decision also allowed him to revisit the Hollywood film musicals he had loved in his youth.

Branagh cast the film without much regard for singing or dancing ability; as in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;, the film was meant to highlight energy and enthusiasm rather than smooth competence. Of the cast, only Nathan Lane was known primarily for musical work. Preproduction was dominated by rigorous dancing and singing coaching.

Branagh reversed the philosophy he had used with &quot;Hamlet&quot; (that is, to keep every word of the original), and instead made major cuts in the play&#x27;s text. The released version retains only about a quarter of Shakespeare&#x27;s lines; although Branagh managed to include all seventeen of the original speaking roles, some (most notably among the lower-class characters) are cut almost to nothing.

==Music==
In adapting the play to a musical, numerous songs primarily from the 1930s were featured, often in place of much dialogue. They include:

*I&#x27;d Rather Charleston (George Gershwin/Desmond Carter)
*I Get a Kick Out of You (Cole Porter)
*I Won&#x27;t Dance (Jerome Kern/Dorothy Fields)
*No Strings (I&#x27;m Fancy Free) (Irving Berlin)
*The Way You Look Tonight (Jerome Kern/Dorothy Fields)
*I&#x27;ve Got a Crush on You (George Gershwin/Ira Gershwin)
*Cheek to Cheek (Irving Berlin)
*Let&#x27;s Face the Music and Dance (Irving Berlin)
*There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business (Irving Berlin)
*They Can&#x27;t Take That Away From Me (George Gershwin/Ira Gershwin)

==Release==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; was met with a mixed reception from critics. It currently holds a 50% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of 5.54/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Interesting idea, poor execution.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert called the film &quot;winsome, charming, sweet and slight&quot;, but gave it only two-and-a-half out of four stars, attributing some of the film&#x27;s flaws to the original material: &quot;All is light and winning, and yet somehow empty. It&#x27;s no excuse that the starting point was probably the weakest of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; is hardly ever performed on the stage and has never been previously filmed, and there is a reason for that: It&#x27;s not about anything. In its original form, instead of the songs and dances we have dialogue that&#x27;s like an idle exercise in easy banter for Shakespeare.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; complained that the film &quot;should be fun but isn&#x27;t... worst of all perhaps is its smug air of pleasure at how clever it thinks it&#x27;s being.&quot;

Some critics complained about the casting. Nathan Lane as Costard received favourable notice, as did Adrian Lester. But the leads (Silverstone and Nivola) were generally panned; Stanley Kauffmann, who had been highly complimentary of Branagh&#x27;s four-hour film version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, called them &quot;inadequate in every way.&quot; John Simon complained as well of cutting that left the film&#x27;s best actors (he mentions McEwan and Briers) with little to do. Kauffmann and Simon both noted that the film&#x27;s ending, in which newsreel footage shows the men going off to fight in World War II, was grotesquely at odds with the frothy tone of the movie it concluded.

Conversely, the film did receive notably positive reviews from such critics as &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Derek Elley, A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and online critic James Berardinelli. Elley described the film as a &quot;luscious labor of love&quot; saying, &quot;anyone with an open mind and a hankering for the simple pleasures of Tinsletown&#x27;s Golden Age will be rewarded with 90-odd minutes of often silly, frequently charming and always honest entertainment.&quot; Scott also gave the film a lukewarm review, calling the &quot;gee-whiz amateurism&quot; part of the movie&#x27;s charm, stating &quot;Even though &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; is, in showbiz terms, a turkey stuffed with chestnuts, you wouldn&#x27;t trade it for a pot of gold.&quot;

Berardinelli gave the film three out of four stars, calling it &quot;about 1/3 Shakespeare, 1/3 song-and-dance, and 1/3 ribald slapstick&quot; and describing the balance as &quot;awkward, but the overall result is strangely appealing.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Although &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; does not score the kind of complete success that Branagh has achieved with his other Shakespeare adaptations, it is a welcome addition, not only because it represents the first time the play has been brought to the screen, but because it shows the lengths to which the director is willing to stretch the envelope. Flaws (most of which are minor) aside, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; is an enjoyable trifle, especially for those who don&#x27;t take their Shakespeare &quot;too&quot; seriously and those who love the old Hollywood musicals as much as Branagh obviously does.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; was not a box office success. It opened on 31 March 2000 in the United Kingdom, grossing £143,649 from 186 screens on its opening weekend. It later opened on 11 June 2000 in the United States, playing on two screens and grossing $24,496 on its opening weekend. In its US release, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; played on fewer than 20 screens and brought in $284,291 against a budget of $13 million.

<doc id="297000" wikidata="Q580018" url="?curid=297000" title="Monetary economics">
<text>Monetary economics is the branch of economics that studies the different theories of money: it provides a framework for analyzing money and considers its functions ( as medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account), and it considers how money can gain acceptance purely because of its convenience as a public good. The discipline has historically prefigured, and remains integrally linked to, macroeconomics. This branch also examines the effects of monetary systems, including regulation of money and associated financial institutions and international aspects.

Modern analysis has attempted to provide microfoundations for the demand for money and to distinguish valid nominal and real monetary relationships for micro or macro uses, including their influence on the aggregate demand for output. Its methods include deriving and testing the implications of money as a substitute for other assets and as based on explicit frictions.

==History==

===Islamic Golden Age===
At around the same time in the medieval Islamic world, a vigorous monetary economy was created during the 7th–12th centuries on the basis of the expanding levels of circulation of a stable high-value currency (the dinar). Innovations introduced by Muslim economists, traders and merchants include the earliest uses of credit, cheques, promissory notes, savings accounts, transactional accounts, loaning, trusts, exchange rates, the transfer of credit and debt, and banking institutions for loans and deposits.

===1500s to 1700s===

In the Indian subcontinent, Sher Shah Suri (1540–1545), introduced a silver coin called a &quot;rupiya&quot;, weighing 178 grams. Its use was continued by the Mughal rulers. The history of the rupee traces back to Ancient India circa 3rd century BC. Ancient India was one of the earliest issuers of coins in the world, along with the Lydian staters, several other Middle Eastern coinages and the Chinese wen.
The term is from &quot;rūpya&quot;, a Sanskrit term for silver coin, from Sanskrit rūpa, beautiful form.

The imperial taka was officially introduced by the monetary reforms of Muhammad bin Tughluq, the emperor of the Delhi Sultanate, in 1329. It was modeled as representative money, a concept pioneered as paper money by the Mongols in China and Persia. The tanka was minted in copper and brass. Its value was exchanged with gold and silver reserves in the imperial treasury. The currency was introduced due to the shortage of metals.

Both the Kabuli rupee and the Kandahari rupee were used as currency in Afghanistan prior to 1891, when they were standardized as the Afghan rupee. The Afghan rupee, which was subdivided into 60 paisas, was replaced by the Afghan afghani in 1925.

Until the middle of the 20th century, Tibet&#x27;s official currency was also known as the Tibetan rupee.

Serious interest in the concepts behind money occurred during the dramatic period of inflation in the late 15th to early 17th centuries known as the Price Revolution, during which the value of gold fell precipitously, sometimes fluctuating wildly, because of the importation of gold from the New World, primarily by Spain.

At the end of this period, the first modern texts on monetary economics were beginning to appear.

During the eighteenth century, the concept of banknotes became more common in Europe. David Hume referred to it as &quot;this new invention of paper&quot;.

In 1705, John Law in Scotland published &quot;Money and Trade Considered&quot;, which examined the failure of metal-based money during the previous hundred and fifty years. He proposed replacing that system with a land bank system of paper money based on the value of real estate. He succeeded in getting this proposal implemented. However, his bank failed due to a bubble of speculation collapsing into extreme inflation; perhaps because he failed to take the lessons of the Spanish Price Revolution seriously.

In 1720, Isaac Gervaise wrote &quot;The System or Theory of the Trade of the World&quot;. He criticised mercantilism and state-supported credit for the inflation problems of his era.

&quot;Della Moneta&quot;, was published by Ferdinando Galiani in 1751, and is arguably the first modern text on economic theory. It was printed twenty-five years before Adam Smith&#x27;s more famous book, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, which touched on some of the same topics. &quot;Della Moneta&quot; covered many modern monetary concepts, including the value, origin, and regulation of money. It carefully examined the possible causes for money&#x27;s value to fluctuate.

The year following, 1752, &quot;Of the Balance of Trade&quot; was published by Hume. He argued that one need not worry about the import or export of goods creating a surplus or shortage of either money or goods because an excess or shortage of money will always increase or decrease demand until equilibrium is reached. In modern economic terms, this is as equilibration through the price–specie flow mechanism.

==Modern Theory of money==
The foundational concept of any modern theory of money is the understanding that the value of fiat money depends upon exchange and not weight (compare with the Arrow–Debreu model).

==Research areas==
Traditionally, research areas in monetary economics have included:

* Empirical determinants and measurement of the money supply, whether narrowly, broadly, or index-aggregated, in relation to economic activity
* Empirical determinants of the demand for money.
* Credit theory of money (also called debt theory of money), concerning the relationship between credit and money.
* Debt deflation and balance-sheet theories, which hypothesize that over-extension of credit associated with a subsequent asset-price fall generate business fluctuations through the wealth effect on net worth.
* Monetary aspects studied by central banks.
* The monetary/fiscal policy relationship to macroeconomic stability
* The effect of money supply growth on inflation.
* The political economy of financial regulation and monetary policy
* Monetary implications of the asset-price/macroeconomic relation: the quantity theory of money, monetarism, and the importance and stability of the relation between the money supply and interest rates, the price level, and nominal and real output of an economy.

* Monetary impacts on interest rates and the term structure of interest rates
* Lessons of monetary/financial history

* Transmission mechanisms of monetary policy as to the macroeconomy

<doc id="297001" wikidata="Q297107" url="?curid=297001" title="Ashikaga Takauji">
<text>also known as Minamoto no Takauji was the founder and first &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Ashikaga shogunate. His rule began in 1338, beginning the Muromachi period of Japan, and ended with his death in 1358. He was a male-line descendant of the samurai of the (Minamoto) Seiwa Genji line (meaning they were descendants of Emperor Seiwa) who had settled in the Ashikaga area of Shimotsuke Province, in present-day Tochigi Prefecture.

According to Zen master and intellectual Musō Soseki, who enjoyed his favor and collaborated with him, Takauji had three qualities. First, he kept his cool in battle and was not afraid of death. Second, he was merciful and tolerant. Third, he was very generous with those below him.

==Life==

His childhood name was Matagorō (又太郎). Takauji was a general of the Kamakura shogunate sent to Kyoto in 1333 to put down the Genkō War which had started in 1331. After becoming increasingly disillusioned with the Kamakura shogunate over time, Takauji joined the banished Emperor Go-Daigo and Kusunoki Masashige, and seized Kyoto. Soon after, Nitta Yoshisada joined their cause, and laid siege to Kamakura. When the city fell to Nitta, the Shogunal regent, Hōjō Takatoki, and his clansmen committed suicide. This ended the Kamakura shogunate, as well as the Hōjō clan&#x27;s power and influence. Go-Daigo was enthroned once more as emperor, reestablishing the primacy of the Imperial court in Kyoto and starting the so-called Kenmu Restoration.

However, shortly thereafter, the samurai clans became increasingly disillusioned with the reestablished imperial court, which sought to return to the social and political systems of the Heian period. Sensing their discontent, Takauji pleaded with the emperor to do something before rebellion would break out, however his warnings were ignored.

Hōjō Tokiyuki, son of Takatoki, took the opportunity to start the Nakasendai rebellion to try to reestablish the shogunate in Kamakura in 1335. Takauji put down the rebellion and took Kamakura for himself. Taking up the cause of his fellow samurai, he claimed the title of &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot; and allotted land to his followers without permission from the court. Takauji announced his allegiance to the imperial court, but Emperor Go-Daigo sent Nitta Yoshisada to reclaim Kamakura.

Takauji defeated Yoshisada in the battles of Sanoyama and Mishima. This cleared the path for Takauji and Tadayoshi to march on to Kyoto. He captured Kyoto for a few days in February 1336, only to be driven out and fled to Kyūshū due to the arrival of forces under Prince Takanaga, Prince Norinaga, Kitabatake Akiie and Yūki Munehiro.

After Takauji and his brother were forced to retreat to the west, he then allied himself with the clans native to Kyūshū. After defeating the Kikuchi clan at Hakata Bay in the Battle of Tatarahama (1336), Takauji was &quot;virtually master of Kyushu&quot;. His brother advanced simultaneously by land and both reached the environs of present-day Kobe in July.

At the decisive Battle of Minatogawa in 1336, Takauji defeated Yoshisada again and killed Masashige, allowing him to seize Kyoto for good. Emperor Kōmyō of the illegitimate Northern Court (see below) was installed as emperor by Takauji in opposition to the exiled Southern Court, beginning the turbulent Northern and Southern Court period (&quot;Nanbokuchō&quot;), which saw two emperors fight each other and which would last for almost 60 years.

Besides other honors, Emperor Go-Daigo had given Takauji the title of &quot;Chinjufu-shōgun&quot;, or Commander-in-chief of the Defense of the North, and the courtly title of the Fourth Rank, Junior Grade. His Buddhist name was Tojiinden Niyama Myogi dai koji Chojuji-dono (等持院殿仁山妙義大居士長寿寺殿).

==Family tree==










==Timeline of shogunate==
Significant events which shaped the period during which Takauji was &quot;shōgun&quot; are:
* 1338 – Takauji appointed &quot;shōgun&quot;.
* 1349 – Go-Murakami flees to A&#x27;no; Ashikaga Tadayoshi and Kō no Moronao quarrel; Ashikaga Motouji, son of Takauji, appointed Kamakura Kanrei
* 1350 – Tadayoshi, excluded from administration, turns priest; Tadayoshi&#x27;s adopted son, Ashikaga Tadafuyu is wrongly repudiated as a rebel.
* 1351–1358 – Struggle for Kyoto.
* 1351 – Tadayoshi joins Southern Court, southern army takes Kyoto; truce, Takauji returns to Kyoto; Tadayoshi and Takauji reconciled; Kō no Moronao and Kō no Moroyasu are exiled.
* 1352 – Tadayoshi dies, Southern army recaptures Kyoto; Nitta Yoshimune captures Kamakura; Ashikaga forces recapture Kamakura and Kyoto; Tadafuyu joins Southern Court; Yamana Tokiuji joins Tadafuyu.
* 1353 – Kyoto retaken by Southern forces under Yamana Tokiuji; retaken by Ashikaga forces.
* 1354 – Takauji flees with Go-Kōgon; Kitabatake Chikafusa dies.
* 1355 – Kyoto taken by Southern army; Kyoto retaken by Ashikaga forces.
* 1358 – Takauji dies.

Takauji&#x27;s son Ashikaga Yoshiakira succeeded him as &quot;shōgun&quot; after his death. His grandson Ashikaga Yoshimitsu united the Northern and Southern courts in 1392.

== Eras of Takauji&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot; ==
Because of the anomalous situation, which he had himself created and which saw two Emperors reign simultaneously, one in Yoshino and one in Kyoto, the years in which Takauji was &quot;shōgun&quot; as reckoned by the Gregorian calendar are identified in Japanese historical records by two different series of Japanese era names (&quot;nengō&quot;), that following the datation used by the legitimate Southern Court and that formulated by the pretender Northern Court.

Eras as reckoned by the Southern Court (declared legitimate by a Meiji era decree because in possession at the time of the Japanese Imperial Regalia):
* &quot;Engen&quot; (1336–1340)
* &quot;Kōkoku&quot; (1340–1346)
* &quot;Shōhei&quot; (1346–1370)
Eras as reckoned by the pretender Northern Court (declared illegitimate by a Meiji era decree because not in possession at the time of the Japanese Imperial Regalia):
* &quot;Ryakuō&quot; (1338–1342)
* &quot;Kōei&quot; (1342–1345)
* &quot;Jōwa&quot; (1345–1350)
* &quot;Kan&#x27;ō or Kannō&quot; (1350–1352)
* &quot;Bunna&quot; (1352–1356)
* &quot;Enbun&quot; (1356–1361)

==Literary references==
The story of Ashikaga Takauji, Emperor Go-Daigo, Nitta Yoshisada, and Kusunoki Masashige from the Genko rebellion to the establishment of the Northern and Southern Courts is detailed in the 40 volume Muromachi period epic &quot;Taiheiki&quot;.

==Honours==
*Junior First Rank (9 July 1358; posthumous)

==In popular culture==
*The 29th NHK &quot;Taiga&quot; drama &quot;Taiheiki&quot; depicted the life of Takauji.

<text>Basilan, officially the Province of Basilan (; ; ; ), is an island province of the Philippines located primarily in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. Basilan Island is the largest and northernmost of the major islands of the Sulu Archipelago. It is just off the southern coast of the geographic Zamboanga Peninsula.

Isabela, the most populous city and the former capital, is a component city under the provincial government of Basilan but is administered as part of the Zamboanga Peninsula Region and is listed statistically independent. The provincial capital has since been transferred to Lamitan. Despite this, the provincial Capitol and government offices are still located at Isabela.

Basilan is home to three main ethnolinguistic groups: the indigenous Yakans, and the later-arriving Tausugs and Chavacanos. The Yakans and Tausugs are predominantly Muslim, while the Chavacano are mainly Christian. There are also a number of smaller ethnic groups. Although the official languages are Filipino and English, the main native language is Yakan and lingua franca is Chavacano. Other languages include Tausug, Cebuano, and Sama.

Basilan, although classified as a 3rd-class province in terms of gross provincial income, has one of the lowest incidences of poverty in the Philippines (26.19% of the general population), ranked 20 among the Philippines&#x27; 80 provinces. (In comparison, Maguindanao which is ranked last at number 80 has a poverty incidence of 44.24%.) The gap between Basilan&#x27;s rich and poor residents are among the narrowest in the country (ranked 3rd nationwide), pointing to one of the most equitable distributions of wealth anywhere in the country (Gini coefficient 0.2826, which is slightly better than the provinces of Pampanga, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Cavite, Batanes and Batangas).

==Etymology==

Antonio Pigafetta of the Magellan Expedition, records the name of Basilan as &quot;Taghima&quot;, and was variously spelled in other early European maps as &quot;Tanguima&quot;, &quot;Taglima&quot;, &quot;Tagimar&quot;, &quot;Tagema&quot;, and &quot;Tagyto&quot;. The first record of it being called &quot;Basilan&quot; is by a Jesuit historian, Fr. Colin. 

Oral traditions of the local Yakan people include several names for pre-historic Basilan: &quot;Uleyan&quot;, which is derived from the present-named Basilan Peak (Puno Mahaji), and later changed to &quot;Matangal&quot; after a mountain farther to the east of the island. These names were presumably used by the Maguindanao traders from mainland Mindanao, using these mountains as navigation landmarks when sailing the Celebes Sea.

Other names romantically given were &quot;Puh Gulangan&quot; or &quot;island of forests&quot;, &quot;Umus Tambun&quot; or &quot;fertile land&quot;, &quot;Kumalarang&quot; after the westward flowing river on the island&#x27;s western half which is otherwise called Baunuh Peggesan.

==History==

===Early ===
In the order of tens of thousands of years ago, Melanesians arrived in the Philippines travelling down to Mindanao. Several thousands of years ago, Austronesians arrived in the Philippines, also travelling down to Mindanao.

===Ancient history===
The Yakan people arrived in the area of the Sulu Archipelago, of which Basilan is a part, around 300 BCE to 200 BCE. Little is known of them before the era of Spanish colonization, but they still make up the largest ethnic group on the main island of Basilan. It is believed that the Yakan people of Basilan made contact with the Kingdom of Champa in present-day Vietnam, and many of them have ancestries from Champa settlers, who later integrated with the Yakan.

As the Tausug Sultanate of Sulu grew in power, the Yakans withdrew inland, until most of the coastal communities along the island&#x27;s southern, western and northwestern shores were primarily inhabited by Tausugs and their vassal tribes, the Samals and Bajaus (Tau-Laut). The only exception was the relatively prosperous Yakan communities of Lamitan.

===Taguima===
Documents from the royal archives of the Sulu Sultanate referred to the northernmost island of the Sulu Archipelago as Taguima, from the Yakan who were called &quot;Tagihamas&quot; (people of the interior or hinterlands) by the Tausug and Samal peoples who came and settled in numerous scattered communities along Basilan&#x27;s western and southwestern shores and outlying islets and island groups.

Later references mentioned &quot;Bantilan&quot;, probably referring to Maluso, which was established as a major Tausug base by Sulu Sultan Muizz ud-Din (whose princely name was Datu Bantilan).

Imperial Chinese texts mention a &quot;Kingdom of Kumalarang&quot; (from the Yakan &quot;kumalang&quot; or &quot;to sing&quot;, owing to the location being a place for celebrations and gatherings) during the Ming Dynasty, believed to be the island which now has a &quot;barangay&quot; of the same name on its northwestern shores.

Basilan was seen and mentioned by the remnants of the Ferdinand Magellan expedition in 1521.
The earliest map of the Philippines which made reference to an island labeled &quot;Taguima&quot; was produced by Giacomo Gastaldi, through woodblock prints in 1548. It was subsequently included in the influential travel book of Giovanni Battista Ramusio, the &quot;Della Navigatione e Viaggi&quot;, which was published between 1556 and 1583 in three volumes. This was followed by Abraham Ortelius&#x27;s work &quot;Indiae Orientalis Insularumque Adiacientium Typus&quot;, published in 1573 in a German text edition of the atlas &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot; by Christophe Plantin in Antwerp. As late as 1719, a map titled &quot;Die philippinische Inseln - Isle Brneo&quot; by Allain Manesson Mallet of Frankfurt, Germany featured an island labeled &quot;Tagyma I.&quot;

The process by which all these names became &quot;Basilan&quot; is almost certainly due to miscommunication between the natives and the Spanish, as well as the penchant to engage in editorial license by European map-makers of the era.

Basilan&#x27;s name may also derive from its iron ore deposits. Tausug warriors and slave-traders from Sulu came to Taguima to purchase high-quality magnetic iron ores, which they used for swords, knives and other blades. This profitable trade, helped in large measure by the establishment of Maluso as a major military-naval base of the Sulu Sultanate, eventually gave the island the distinction of being the source of &quot;basih-balan&quot;, the Tausug word for magnetic iron. Roughly translated and abbreviated, however, &quot;basih-lan&quot; means &quot;the iron (magnet) trail&quot; or &quot;the iron way&quot;.

When several Tausug warriors were caught by the Spanish in one of their numerous raids on the Zamboanga settlement, Spanish officials supposedly admired the artistry and skill that went into making the warriors&#x27; elaborately decorated swords, knives and blades. They asked where these weapons could be bought. From atop the ramparts of the Spanish commandery at the Fuerza del Nuestra Senora del Pilar de Zaragoza (Fort Pilar), the warriors supposedly pointed to the island visible across today&#x27;s Basilan Strait, and said, simply, &quot;ha basih-lan&quot;.

Reports from the Jesuit &quot;reducciones&quot; in Zamboanga and Pasangen (Isabela) were relayed to Manila, where Spanish cartographer Pedro Murillo de Velarde published &quot;Historia de la Provincia de Philipinas de la Compañia de Jesvs. Segvnda parte&quot; using the Jesuit printing press at Manila in 1749. It featured a map of the Philippines with the unofficial &quot;I. Basilan&quot;. The map was re-published by Leipzig map-maker Nicolaus Bellinn for general European circulation in 1752.

Finally, to represent a clear break from the Habsburg Dynasty (which had ruled Spain for 184 years from 1516 to 1700), the first officially sanctioned Spanish maps of its colonies, including &quot;Las Islas de Mindanao&quot;, were commissioned by the Bourbons (1700–present). This particular map of Mindanao, apparently copied from the Nicolaus Bellinn map of 1752, was published by Nicolas Norton Nicols in 1757, featuring &quot;Basilan&quot; and bearing the royal stamp of Spanish Bourbon King Ferdinand VI. It has been called &quot;Isla de Basilan&quot; (Basilan Island) ever since.

===Spanish rule===
It was eventually colonized by the Spanish as early as 1636 and was formally ceded by the Sulu Sultanate to Spain in 1726. The withdrawal of the Yakans inland was hastened by Spanish establishment of advance bases on the island&#x27;s northwestern coast, bringing in Christianized &#x27;indios&#x27; and Latin Americans from Zamboanga, as well as Visayans and Tagalogs, from the Visayas and Luzon. By then, even the Yakan communities of Lamitan were completely overrun. Jesuit missionaries brought Catholicism to the region. Fighting with the Sultanate, the Dutch East India Company, Moro Pirates, and the French figured in Basilan&#x27;s history over the years.

===American invasion era===
With its victory in the 1898 Spanish–American War, the United States gained possession of the Philippines. Americans proceeded to &#x27;pacify&#x27; Basilan, cleared large expanses of land, and established plantations, mainly to produce rubber and copra.

===Japanese occupation era===
Following the Japanese occupation of the country during World War II, in 1946, the Philippines gained its independence. Beginning around 1970, heavy fighting broke out between the Philippine government and the Moro National Liberation Front, which was determined to secede and form a new country.

===Philippine independence===
In 1973, Basilan officially became a province carved out in the Province of Zamboanga del Sur.

===Contemporary===
The province joined the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao in 2001, it was last province to do so. Its former capital, Isabela City, opted out and remains a part of the Zamboanga Peninsula Region (formerly Western Mindanao, Region 9).

The capital town Lamitan became a component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 9393&quot; which sought to convert the town into a city. The law was ratified on June 18, 2007. However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law. The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.

==Geography==
Basilan is located between latitudes 6°15&#x27; and 7°00&#x27; and longitudes 121°15&#x27; and 122°30&#x27;. The island is bordered by the Basilan Strait to the north, the Sulu Sea to the northwest and west, the Moro Gulf to the northeast, and the Celebes Sea to the south, southeast and east.

Basilan is the largest and northernmost island of the Sulu Archipelago between the Philippine islands of Mindanao and Borneo which includes about 400 islands. Basilan Strait, about at its narrowest point, separates Basilan Island from the mainland of Mindanao and the port city of Zamboanga. The terrain of the island is simple, with several undulating slopes concentrated around Isabela City along the coastal areas and hilly towards the interior. Urban areas are usually above sea level and gently sloping to towards the hinterlands. The stand of timber and forest vegetation is more or less evenly distributed throughout.
The province encompasses Basilan Island and all nearby offshore islands, together with the Pilas Island group (now Hadji Muhtamad Municipality) west of the island, and the Bubuan and Tapiantana Island group (now Tabuan-Lasa Municipality) in the south. These are listed among the Philippine islands with a moderate risk of getting hit by tsunamis. The province has a land area of under its jurisdiction. Basilan Island itself has an area of and a shoreline of .

Basilan National Park is at the eastern portion of the remaining public forest between the city of Isabela and the municipalities of Lamitan, Tipo-Tipo and Sumisip. The park has an elevation of above sea level, and the tallest peak, Puno Mahaji or Basilan Peak, dominates the park&#x27;s landscape.

===Climate===
The climate is similar to other areas in the Zamboanga Peninsula. The annual average rainfall is and the mean annual temperature is . The source of the rainfall is the southwest monsoon and the island&#x27;s location in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The climate is classified as a tropical wet and dry climate or &quot;Aw&quot; using the Köppen climate classification system.

Basilan is outside the typhoon belt. Prevailing winds are from the southwest with a speed of .

March to May is hot and dry, with temperature averaging . June to October is rainy. November to February is cool, with temperatures ranging from to . Average humidity year-round is 77%.

===Administrative divisions===

Basilan is subdivided into 11 municipalities and two cities. There are 255 barangays.

Basilan used to be part of Western Mindanao (former name for Zamboanga Peninsula), but, across the two plebiscites, the majority of the province&#x27;s residents Basilan opted to join ARMM in 2001, and Bangsamoro, which superseded ARMM, in 2019. However, the city of Isabela has consistently voted against its inclusion to the region, so the city remains a part of Zamboanga Peninsula. 

==== Cities ====
Isabela, on the northern shore of Basilan Island facing Zamboanga City, is a component city of the province, formerly serving as its capital from 1975 to 2017. Originally called Pasangen (rough English translation for &quot;town&quot;) by natives, it still hosts the Basilan Provincial Capitol, the Governor&#x27;s Executive Residence, the provincial offices of the executive departments and line agencies as well as most of the municipal offices of its neighboring municipalities. In 1848, it was officially renamed Isabela de Basilan, derived from the Spanish fort built on the area where the present Provincial Capitol now stands — Fort Isabella Segunda — which, in turn, was named after Spanish Queen Isabella II. It was renamed Isabela Municipality in 1973 and formally as the City of Isabela in 2001. Isabela votes for provincial officials, shares its tax revenues with the province, and continues to be under the jurisdiction of Basilan for the administration of provincially devolved services and functions. However, for regional and statistical purposes, Isabela is grouped under Zamboanga Peninsula. 

Lamitan is the capital, as well as a component city, of Basilan, located on the Basilan island&#x27;s northeastern coast. Most Bangsamoro regional offices that serve the province are located in the city. Lamitan was proclaimed as the new capital of Basilan since 2017. The locality derives its name from Sultan Kudarat&#x27;s capital town in the Mindanao mainland — Ramitan. The Iranun Sultan built a fortified base in the area to serve as a staging ground for raids on Spanish Zamboanga. The native Yakans regarded this as &quot;a place where people from Ramitan stayed&quot; or Kuta Ramitan. Eventually, the wooden fortress was razed to the ground by Gov. Gen. Corcuera in 1637. Natives just called the place &quot;Ramitan&quot;, and substituting &#x27;R&#x27; with &#x27;L&#x27;, the place gradually became known as simply Lamitan. In 2007, its status was elevated from a municipality to a city, but was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2008, reverting it to being a municipality, until the court overturned its decision in 2011.

==== Municipalities ====
The other five original municipalities are:
*Maluso is on the island&#x27;s southwest, facing the bigger island of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi further south. Its busiest trading port is at Port Holland and Maluso Townsite. According to official accounts, the place derived its name from Spanish &quot;mal uso&quot; (trans. &quot;bad manners&quot;), after the supposedly crude manners of the natives of the place when they established their presence there in the later part of the 19th century.
*Lantawan is in the island&#x27;s westernmost area. It is mostly an agricultural area for copra and rubber production. Its biggest population concentration is Tairan. It has no major port. &quot;Lantawan&quot; is derived from the native root word &quot;lantaw&quot; (trans. &quot;look&quot;), named after Basilan&#x27;s westernmost peninsula&#x27;s sloping hills which served as &quot;lookouts&quot; for natives who observed Tausug and Spanish and ships pass by en route to another raid or naval attack on Jolo or Zamboanga.
*Sumisip is the biggest municipality in land area and hosts what used to be the biggest rubber plantation (Sime Darby) in the Philippines.
*Tuburan is on a peninsula on the extreme eastern part of the island, one of the least developed municipalities and severely devastated by the decades-old armed conflicts plaguing the island. &quot;Tuburan&quot; is rooted in the native word &quot;tubod&quot; (trans. &quot;water spring&quot;), as there is said to be a spring in the area. 
*Tipo-Tipo, the last of the original municipalities created by the presidential decree of Ferdinand Marcos, is on the island&#x27;s southeast coast. It is mostly undeveloped and witness to much of the running gun battles on the island. The place is named after the native word &quot;Tipun-tipunan&quot; (trans. &quot;gathering place&quot;), owing to its tendency for natives of the area to converge in this spot to exchange goods and food stuff with each other.

The latest six municipalities are creations of the regional legislature of the ARMM:
*Akbar (&quot;MMA Act No. 193&quot;), separated from Tuburan municipality in 2005, named after a political strongman, the late Congressman Wahab Akbar
*Al-Barka (&quot;MMA Act No. 191&quot;, ratified in 2006)
*Hadji Mohammad Ajul (&quot;MMA Act No. 192&quot;, ratified in 2006), from Tuburan, named after the first mayor of Tuburan
*Hadji Muhtamad (&quot;MMA Act No. 200&quot;, ratified in 2007), named after the father of late Wahab Akbar and separated from Lantawan
*Tabuan-Lasa (created by virtue of &quot;MMA Act No. 187&quot;, ratified in 2008) was separated from Sumisip and is named after the main islands of Tapiantana, Bubuan, Lanawan and Saluping.
*Ungkaya Pukan (&quot;MMA Act No. 190&quot;, ratified in 2006), named after Orang Kaya Pukan, ancestor of the Akbar family and nemesis of Datu Kalun

The new municipalities were created without the consent of the Philippine Congress. According to some accounts, said municipalities do not reach the basic requirements for the creation of a separate municipality ( area, P2.5 million income, and 25,000 population) under the Philippines&#x27; Local Government Code. (Recent Supreme Court rulings nullified the creation of Shariff Kabunsuan Province, created by the same ARMM Regional Assembly, reverting it to the 1st District of Maguindanao Province.) As a result, four of the six new municipalities have not been included in the government&#x27;s annual budget as approved by Congress and have not received any nationally funded Internal Revenue Allotments (IRA) since their creation. These are Hadji Muhtamad, Hadji Mohammad Ajul, Al Barka and Akbar municipalities.


==Demographics==
===Culture===
The biggest cultural influences on the island derive from Basilan&#x27;s tri-ethnolingusitic community: the native Yakan, Tausug, and Chavacano peoples. The Yakans and Tausugs are predominantly Muslim, while the Chavacano are primarily Catholic.

Among the Tausugs and Samals, the phrase &quot;mag-tausug na kaw&quot; means &quot;become a Muslim&quot;, instead of the more literal translation, &quot;become a Tausug&quot;, as the Tausug ethnic is regarded as the &quot;original Muslims&quot; of the area. Although the majority of the Yakans are Muslims, a significant number conform to traditional local beliefs, traditions and rituals, while a few have likewise opted to be baptized Christians or became atheists or agnostics. Along with a majority of the Chavacano, the Cebuano and the Ilonggo/Hiligaynon Bisaya are also Catholics.

Culturally, the Yakan and the Tausug are distinct ethnolinguistic nations; the Yakan represent the &quot;Lumad&quot; (albeit lately most Yakans have since converted to Islam) or indigenous peoples of Basilan, while the Tausugs, the Samal and the Bajao are regarded as the &quot;original Muslims&quot;, and the Chavacano, Cebuano and Ilonggo are the &quot;Cristianos&quot;. The rest, a mixture of Ilocanos, Waray, Bicolanos, Maranaos, Iranuns and Maguindanaos, are more recent migrants permanently residing in the region, itinerant merchants or government workers.

This mix of ethnicities, forged first by the Spanish practice of establishing re-settlements or &quot;reducciones&quot;, as well as the multinational plantations&#x27; importation of skilled Christian farm workers and laborers from the Visayas and Luzon, gives Basilan a distinct culture in the Philippines. It is the only predominantly Muslim province that is governed primarily by its indigenous population and whose most commonly spoken language is Chavacano.

The Tausugs and Samals, for the most part having been denied ownership of land, and owing to their primary livelihood of fishing, live along the coastlines, constructing their houses on stilts at the water&#x27;s edge near population centers. Their houses are, for the most part, outside of the municipal water and sewerage systems of the urban centers. This group controls nearly 100% of the bountiful aquatic resources that surround the island.

The Yakans, on the other hand, having been driven far inland, are scattered throughout the island&#x27;s interior, in similar raised houses usually made of light materials, but separated from each other. Yakans control nearly all Local Government Units, and since the late 80s have found employment in Government jobs. The Christians are mostly found in the plains, the cities and in the plantations, squeezed between the Tausug-dominated coasts and the Yakan-dominated hinterlands. They make up the bulk of the island&#x27;s professionals, entrepreneurs, and lowland farmers. The Christians, however, own most of the arable land, as well as nearly all of the businesses and occupy most of the professions.

Tausug/Samal festivals are usually connected to the sea, celebrating the bounty of the seas, even staging dazzling fluvial wedding parades on colorfully bedecked and , a nod to the Tausugs&#x27; former naval prowess. Catholic fiestas are almost always related to good harvests on the farms, as well as saintly miracles against natural calamities and victories against Moro attacks in the past. Yakan festivals, meanwhile, are rooted in older, pre-Islamic rituals such as warrior dances, colorful wedding pageants, and harvest rituals.

Culturally, therefore, the Chavacanos, Cebuanos, and Tausugs have had a close relationship, both professionally as well as in trade and commerce, being regarded as the island&#x27;s &quot;lowlanders&quot; by the Yakan, who are regarded as &quot;&quot;de arriba&quot; by the Chavacanos or &quot;tagihamas&quot;&quot; by the Suluanon Tausugs, which roughly translates as &quot;uplanders&quot;. Conversely, the Yakan have reason to be suspicious of the intents and motives of their lowland neighbors, having been at the receiving end of slave raids, invasions and punitive attacks from both groups for over 500 years.

With the island&#x27;s strategic location right at the crossroads of the warring camps of Tausugs and the Spanish, Basilan was divided into three primary spheres of cultural dominance by one of the three groups. Basilan&#x27;s northern and northwestern coasts, facing the heavily Hispanized Zamboanga City across the narrow Basilan Strait, is culturally Christian, or more precisely Catholic. Basilan&#x27;s southern and southwestern coastal areas have a distinctly Tausug-oriented culture. The eastern and interior portions of Basilan, on the other hand, isolated for the most part from the Spanish in Zamboanga, and the Tausug from Jolo, are enclaves of the indigenous Yakan.

===Demographics===
By the eve of the Commonwealth era in the Philippines, local census estimates showed that a majority of the people of Basilan were Christian migrants, mostly plantation workers recruited from over Mindanao and the Visayas, and Tausug traders, as well as Samal and Bajau fisherfolk. Only around 5,000 Yakans were counted in the census. Until then, most Yakans preferred not to interact directly with their lowland neighbors.

Statistics from the 2010 Census report () the following breakdown (out of a total 391,179 population):
* Indigenous Yakan: 161,791 (41.36%)
* Christians, i.e., Chavacano / Visayans (which includes Cebuano and Hiligaynon) / Ilocano, etc.: 128,698 (32.9%)
* Other Muslim Tribes, i.e., Tausug / Samal / Bajao / Iranon: 100,690 (25.74%)

The following figures in this subsection are from the National Statistical Coordination Board, NSCB Philippine Database, Census of 2010, unless otherwise noted.

Basilan&#x27; median age was 19 years, lower than the 1995 figure of 25 years.

The sex ratio is almost even. There were 166,413 males and 166,415 females in the 2000 CPH. However, there were more females in the 15-to-39 age group and more males in all other age groups.

The economically active population, ages 15 to 64, comprises 55.2% of the population. About 42.3% are young dependents (0 to 14 years old) while fewer than 3% are old dependents (64 years old and older). The overall dependency ratio is 81.2: for every 100 persons ages 15 to 64, there were about 77 young dependents and 4 old dependents.
Married people accounted for 47.76% of the total people 10 years old and over, lower than the 1995 figure (49.11%). Single people comprised 43.80% in 2000, a decrease from 45.71% in 1995. The widowed (4.49%) increased less than one percentage point from the figure registered in 1995 (3.89%). Those with other arrangements increased from 3.87% in 1995 to 4.49% in 2000.

Out of 60,710 housing units in Basilan, 60,699 (99.98%) were occupied by 61,546 households. This rate of occupancy was higher than that of 1990 (95.6%). There was a ratio of 1.01 households for every occupied housing unit or 5.48 persons per occupied housing unit.

A large proportion (94.3%) of the occupied housing units in Basilan in 2000 were single houses. 75.9% of the occupied housing units did not need repair or with minor repair, while 17.8% needed major repair. One out of nine occupied housing units were built between 1996 and 2000.

The proportion of occupied housing units with roofs made of galvanized iron/aluminum rose from 23.1% in 1990 to 42.5% in 2000. On the other hand, roofs made of cogon/nipa/anahaw declined from 69.6% in 1990 to 50.3% in 2000. As for the construction material of the outer walls, the use of wood rose from 42.2% in 1990 to 52.4% in 2000.

Out of Basilan&#x27;s estimated 60,582 families, 19,740 lived in urban areas and 40,842 were rural. Average poverty thresholds province-wide were pegged at Php9,271.00 monthly family income, of which Php10,997.00 was considered the urban threshold and Php8,080.00 the threshold for rural families. 26.20% of the total population was below the poverty threshold: 36.50% of the urban population and 21.20% of the rural.

Poverty incidence is defined as the proportion of families whose income cannot provide for the basic food and non-food requirements called the poverty threshold to the total number of families. According to the ARMM government website, in 2006, Basilan ranked 46th among all provinces, with a poverty incidence of 31.7.

====Population growth 2000-2007====
Basilan experienced a rapid increase in population; between 2000 and 2007, the population increased by 163,675, from 332,828 to 496,503, which is an annual growth rate of , whereas it only rose by 37,263 between 1995 and 2000, an annual growth rate of . A corresponding increase in the number of households was also registered, from 55,137 in 1995 to 61,546 in 2000. This resulted to an average household size of 5.4 persons, higher than the national average of five.

Of the seven original municipalities in Basilan as of May 1, 2000, Isabela, then capital of the province, was the largest in terms of population with 73,032 persons or 21.94% of the provincial total. It was followed by Lamitan (17.64%), Sumisip (15.23%), Tipo-Tipo (14.50%), and Tuburan (12.78%). Lantawan and Maluso, on the other hand, had less than 10% each.
By 2007, the three biggest local government units (LGUs) saw their shares of the population fall relative to neighboring communities; Isabela City fell to 17.72% of Basilan&#x27;s total population despite remaining the most densely populated area on the island. Lamitan is now only at 16.53% (-1.11%). Old Sumisip (two municipalities with a population of 71,807), with the biggest aggregate land area, fell to 14.46% (-0.77%). Meanwhile, Old Tipo-Tipo (three municipalities: 83,249 pop.) rose to 16.75% (+2.25%) and is now bigger than Lamitan, while Old Tuburan (three municipalities: 73,942 pop.) is 14.89% (+2.11%) and is now bigger than Old Sumisip. Old Lantawan (two municipalities: 49,270 pop.) is at 9.92%, while Maluso (48,175 pop.) comprises 9.7% of the total.

The seven-year increases are widely disparate, which explains the 2000–2007 percentage figures stated above. In Isabela City, the population growth was 20.47% (+ per annum; 73,032 in 2000, to 87,985 in 2007), slower when compared to the newly created Akbar Municipality, scene of many of the latest gun-battles between government troops and Moro separatist groups. The municipality&#x27;s seven-year population growth was 101.42% (+ per annum; 10,581 in 2000 to 21,312 in 2007). The average aggregate annual population increase in the seven-year period for the ten municipalities and one city that comprise Basilan was 9.12%. By comparison, that of the rest of the Philippines was only 2.3%.

These figures are derived from the National Statistics and Coordination Board and Philippine Statistics Authority.

These rapid growth rates have been attributed mainly to the practice of local governments of padding their real population numbers to
* obtain a bigger slice of the Internal Revenue Allotment fund given to Philippine LGUs, 
* fulfill minimum requirements set by the Philippine Local Government Code (for the newly created municipalities and Lamitan city)
*as well as a reserve of votes for local political clans from constituencies that &quot;usually&quot; record 100% turn-outs during election periods.

====Basilan Census 2010====
The rapid growth between 2000 and 2007 is replaced by a drastic reduction in the 2007–2010 figures after the previous figures were subjected to stricter statistical analyses, reflecting a more statistically plausible growth trajectory from 2000 to 2010.

As a result, Basilan&#x27;s 2010 population declined from 496,503 to 391,179, a contraction of 105,324 or -21.21%, a PGR of .

Out of Basilan&#x27;s two Cities and 11 Municipalities, only two LGUs registered increases in population:
* Isabela City grew from 87,985 to 97,857, an increase of 9,872 or +11.22% ( PGR); and
* Tabuan Lasa grew from 13,384 to 18,635, an increase of 5,251 or +39.23% ( PGR).

The rest recorded drastic declines in population:
* Lamitan City, from 82,074 to 68,996, a decline of 13,078 or -14.86% ( PGR);
* Sumisip, from 58,423 to 37,031, a decline of 21,392 or -36.61% ( PGR);
* Maluso, from 48,175 to 33,803, a decline of 14,372 or -29.83% ( PGR);
* Ungkaya Pukan, from 30,472 to 17,701, a decline of 12,771 or -41.91% ( PGR);
* Lantawan, from 28,978 to 20,087, a decline of 8,891 or -30.68% ( PGR);
* Tipo-Tipo, from 26,548 to 16,978, a decline of 9,570 or -36.05% ( PGR);
* Tuburan, from 26,498 to 18,988, a decline of 7,519 or -28.34% ( PGR);
* Al Barka, from 26,229 to 19,523, a decline of 6,706 or -25.57% ( PGR);
* Hji. Mohammad Ajul, from 26,132 to 15,962, a decline of 10,170 or -38.92% ( PGR);
* Akbar, from 21,312 to 13,369, a decline of 7,943 or -37.27% ( PGR); and
* Hji. Muhtamad, from 20,292 to 12,249, a decline of 8,043 or -39.64% ( PGR).

===Religion===
====Islam====
The majority of Basilan&#x27;s population is Muslim, accounting for 65%. The others are mostly Christian (mainly Roman Catholic), accounting for 33% of the population. A majority of Basilan&#x27;s Muslim population (41%) practice Sunni Islam of the Shafi&#x27;i tradition, as taught by Arab, Persian, Indian Muslim, and Malay missionaries from the 14th century onwards. A substantial remainder follow a syncretist mix of Islam and Yakan folk customs and traditions exclusively among the native Yakan populations farther inland, and a different version of the same folk Islamic tradition which is practiced by the Bajao in Basilan&#x27;s outlying islands and surrounding seas.

A majority of Basilan&#x27;s Muslims are concentrated on the island&#x27;s southern slopes while Christians reside mostly in the urban centers of Isabela and Lamitan on the island&#x27;s northern coast, where they constitute a majority. Sizable Christian settlements are also found in the former multi-national plantations, for example Tairan, Lantawan; Tumahubong, Sumisip; Maluso Townsite, Maluso. The rest have a mixture of traditional and autochthonal beliefs.

Relatively newer Islamic sects, mostly brought by returning veterans of the Afghan wars and missionaries from Pakistan&#x27;s stricter Sufi traditions, referred to as the Tableegh, have been active in propagating what they believe to be a &quot;purer&quot; Islamic way of life and worship. A very small number who have since married into Iranian or Iraqi families have converted to Shiite Islam.

====Catholicism====
The Jesuit mission established in 1637 was replaced by a parish when Basilan was reassigned to the Order of Augustinian Recollects in 1850. The Jesuits regained Isabela Parish from 1860 to 1880, and then lost it again to the Recollects, who administered the parish until 1920, at which time Isabela de Basilan was turned over to diocesan priests until 1930. From 1930 through 1950, the Jesuits returned to Isabela, finally relinquishing their long-held outpost to the Claretian Fathers, who took over from 1951 to 1974.

The Isabela Parish burned to the ground in 1962 and was rebuilt in 1964 under the aegis of Basilan&#x27;s first bishop, José María Querexeta, a Spaniard. The cathedral was consecrated to Santa Isabel in 1970, and diocesan priests have since administered the same from 1974 to the present. The cathedral figured prominently in the news, suffering one destructive explosion in a triple bomb blast on April 13, 2010.

The Prelature of Isabela de Basilan was created on October 12, 1963, and comprises all territories constituting the civil jurisdiction of Basilan Province, including Isabela. Its titular patron is Santa Isabel de Portugal.

Bishop Querexeta was succeeded by Bishop Rómulo T. de la Cruz, Basilan&#x27;s first Filipino bishop, on February 16, 1989, who served until January 10, 2002, when the present bishop, Martin S. Jumoad took over.

===Others===
Non-Catholic Christians include Evangelicals, Jesus Miracle Crusade, Episcopalian, and Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and other Protestant denominations. Only the most recent Chinese immigrants adhere to Buddhism or Taoism, while most of the older Chinese families have acculturated and have either converted to Christianity or Islam while retaining most of their Chinese beliefs.

===Language===
Basilan is home to several ethnolinguistic groups that have their own native vernacular, the main ones being Chavacano, Tausug, Yakan, and Cebuano (Bisaya). Chavacano is the primary native tongue of the Christian inhabitants of the island and serves as the lingua franca of Basilan, with 80% of residents being able to speak and understand it. Basilan has the biggest concentration of Chavacano speakers in the Philippines outside of Zamboanga City. Tausug is also widely spoken, especially among the Muslims, and is spoken and understood by approximately 70% of Basilan&#x27;s population. Cebuano is a preferred third tongue among the Christian and even the Muslims because of the mass influx of Cebuano settlers to Mindanao, especially among the Tausūg people since the Tausug language is a Visayan language like Cebuano and is spoken and understood by approximately 70% of Basilan&#x27;s residents. Yakan, the acknowledged native language of Basilan, is used primarily by Yakans, although it is spoken and understood by about 15%-20% of the non-Yakan residents. A lesser percentage can speak or understand Samal/Banguingui and Iranon, which are mostly confined to members of their respective ethnolinguistic groups. Many locals and barter traders can speak Sabah Malay.

Tagalog and English are used for official business or government transactions. Hokkien Chinese is used by the immigrant Chinese community and their descendants. Arabic is mostly used in Muslim prayers and songs and seldom spoken as an everyday vernacular.

===Education===
Basilan&#x27;s literacy rate has risen over the past two decades, although it remains one of the Philippines&#x27; lowest; 72.23% are considered literate, as opposed to the national figure of 92.6%.

The province has one state college and five private colleges. Basilan State College is located in Isabela and has an extension college in Lamitan and Maluso. Among the private colleges, there is Computer Technologies Institute-Isabela (est. 1997) and The Mariam School of Nursing in Lamitan (est. 2004).
Basilan is served by three school divisions of the Department of Education, one each for Basilan, Isabela, and Lamitan. The first two are headquartered in Isabela City, and the latter is in Lamitan City.

Public and private high schools dot the province. The premier secondary educational institution on the island is Basilan National High School in Isabela, followed by Lamitan National High School in Lamitan. The Claret High Schools of Isabela, Lamitan, Maluso and Tumahubong, and a number of Madaris provide private elementary and secondary instruction. Claret College of Isabela is the only Claretian institution which offers tertiary level education in the Philippines. Other schools offering stand-alone senior high school are Computer Technologies Institute-Isabela and The Mariam School of Nursing, Inc.-Lamitan.

More than 42% of the population five years old and older attended or completed elementary education, 17.3% attended or completed high school, while 1.5% attended or finished post secondary education. Less than 3% possessed academic degrees, while 6.2 percent were college undergraduates. A very small number pursued post-baccalaureate studies. There were more males than females among those who attended or finished elementary (51.1%), high school (50.3%), among college undergraduates (52.0%) and those who took post baccalaureate courses (58.4%). On the other hand, there were more females who attended or completed post-secondary courses (52.9%) and were academic degree holders (52.34%).

===Clubs and organizations===
There are clubs and social organizations in Basilan, ranging from the Junior Chamber International Basilan Inc. (Basilan Jaycees) to the Basilan Motor Club.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the main source of economic livelihood. Basilan&#x27;s major products include coconut (primarily copra), rubber, coffee, black pepper, and African palm oil. Other crops are palay, corn, cacao and cassava.

The Sulu and Celebes Seas provide fish such as tuna, mackerel, and sardines. Most of these are processed in canning factories in nearby Zamboanga City, General Santos (the Philippines&#x27; tuna capital), and Navotas. The island&#x27;s waters also produce grouper, squid, octopus, and marlin, while fishponds supply milkfish, prawn and shrimp. In addition, seaweed is cultivated along some coastal areas.

The island of Omosmarata in Tuburan (now Mohammad Ajul) is listed among only 15 sites in the Philippines with commercially viable ocean thermal energy potential. The Philippines&#x27; ocean thermal resource area is 1000 square kilometers, based on the archipelagic nature of the country. Based on a study conducted by the Philippines Department of Energy, the potential capacity for this resource is estimated to be 265 million megawatts.

Likewise, the Basilan Strait is listed among only eight sites in the Philippines with commercially viable ocean tidal energy potential (along with Bohol/Talibon Strait, Basiao Channel, Surigao Strait, Gaboc Channel, Hinatuan Passage, San Bernardino Strait and San Juanico Strait).

Only the provinces of Basilan, Samar and Surigao have both high ocean thermal and ocean tidal energy potential. Basilan likewise has significant as yet underdeveloped mineral deposits, specifically, iron ore, gold, manganese, copper, and coal.

Alienable and disposable lands cover , forest lands occupy , are underused, are under forest cultivation, while are under agricultural cultivation.

Local products include woven cloth and trinkets made by the Yakan tribe. Yakans use fibers from plants such as pineapple for their crafts. The weavers traditionally used extracts from leaves, roots and barks to dye their fibers. However, contact with U.S. Peace Corps workers and Christian Filipinos has influenced Yakan textile art. One influence is the introduction of chemical dyes. The museum of Lamitan displays the colorful and intricate traditional Yakan textiles and highlights of the traditional Yakan festival, Lami-lamihan.

===Early history===
Basilan&#x27;s economy has seen wild upswings and downturns over the course of several centuries. Pre-Hispanic Taguima had an economy based on basic subsistence agriculture, mostly root crops. Ancient Chinese texts point to the existence of a &quot;Kingdom of Kumalarang&quot;, which presumably was located on the island&#x27;s northwestern shore, and which occasionally traded with Chinese merchants plying the route to the Spice Islands of the Moluccas and Borneo farther south.

When the Spanish arrived, other crops such as rice and corn were introduced and cultivated, primarily for consumption by the growing Christian settlements of Isabela and Lamitan. Trade with Zamboanga grew tremendously, as most of the settlers&#x27; needs were supplied by regular shipments from the busy Zamboanga port.

===Multinational plantations===

When the United States assumed control of the Philippines after its victory in the Spanish–American War, it brought about the single biggest change in the local economy. By around 1914, Dr. James W. Strong, a pioneering American plantation owner, cleared vast tracts of land on the island&#x27;s northern plains (Isabela/Lamitan), and established what became the Philippines&#x27; first commercial rubber plantation—the American Rubber Co. Upon consulting with Fr. Zamora, a noted botanist of the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, he decided to start experimenting with rubber plants and in 1910, forming the Basilan Rubber Plantation in partnership with J.M. Menzi Corporation as principal stock holders. Seven years later, he sold out his interest to J.M. Menzi Corporation and started American Rubber Co. backed by San Francisco capital. He started building roads in Basilan with the help of his children. Those roads are now part of the National Highway system in Basilan.

The family and plantation prospered and was visited by such notables as Manuel L. Quezon, President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, his vice-president Sergio Osmeña, General Douglas MacArthur and assorted Governor Generals and High Commissioners for the Philippines.

The 913-hectare plantation was eventually sold to American multi-national B. F. Goodrich through its local subsidiary American Rubber Plantation Corp. This was followed by investments from British-Malayan firm Sime Darby Corp., which opened their rubber plantation on the island&#x27;s southern slopes (Sumisip/Tipo-Tipo).

The success of these large-scale cash crop plantations was emulated by a number of enterprising Filipinos and Spanish-mestizo families from Zamboanga, Negros and Luzon. Among these were Don Juan S. Alano, a Hispano-Chinese mestizo and native of Malolos, Bulacan, who opened the Philippine National Sugar Co. on Malamawi Island in 1921. This eventually became the Basilan Estates, Inc., the only 100% Filipino-owned plantation competing with American and British multi-nationals. It operated the Malamawi Island plantation, which was converted to coconut/copra production, and opened a 1,434-hectare copra plantation on the island&#x27;s western plains (Tairan, Lantawan), Basilan&#x27;s third-largest plantation in land area. American logging firms Weyerhaeuser Timber Co. and the American Lumber Co. opened large-scale logging concessions which operated in Basilan&#x27;s extensive upland virgin forest. Menzi Agricultural Corporation, owned by Hispano-German J. M. Menzi, opened a 991-hectare rubber plantation in the southern part of Isabela which eventually expanded to black pepper and palm oil.

The University of the Philippines System was awarded a huge 4,018-hectare land grant by the Philippine government, in Santa Clara, Lamitan. This was eventually taken over by the Marcos-era National Development Corp.

When J. M. Menzi died, he was succeeded at the helm of his substantial business interests by his son and Marcos crony, Hans Menzi. When the younger Menzi replaced the plantation&#x27;s Swiss-expatriate managers with locals, these managers in turn opened up their own plantations elsewhere on the island. Arnold Winniger, Menzi&#x27;s Swiss manager, together with the Cuevas-Pamaran-Antonio-Flores clan of Lamitan, cleared the Tumahubong, Sumisip area with their 316-hectare Siltown Realty Corp. Walter Boelsterli, another one of Menzi&#x27;s Swiss recruits, established the 969-hectare Eurasia Match Inc. plantation around Mangal, Sumisip. An American corporation opened the 1,127-hectare Yakan Plantation in Lamitan. This was eventually sold to JAKA Holdings of Marcos-era Defense Minister and current senator Juan Ponce Enrile. Finally, Dutch-American Donald Wieselski opened another 569-hectare coconut plantation in the Canas, Maluso area. This too was sold off to Eustaquio D. Tan &amp; Sons, Inc. The Wihara Plantation, a Japanese company, opened in the Atong-Atong, Lantawan region. This became the source of many of the coconut varieties planted throughout the island.

By the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, the Chartered City of Basilan, fourth-biggest in the Philippines in terms of land area (after Davao, Puerto Princesa and Zamboanga), was classified as a first-class city. It exported copra, coconut oil, rubber and lumber to California by way of Guam and Hawaii.

A substantial number of expatriate plantation managers, mostly Americans but also Swiss, Germans, Dutch, Russian and even Japanese, Irish, and Swedes lived among and intermarried into the native populace.

The Weyerhaeuser Compound (now Tabuk Barangay) was an exclusive gated community for American expatriates living in Basilan. It had its own airstrip and wharf, and two-storey plantation-style villas set apart by expansive yards. The same sort of exclusive gated communities were put up at the Menzi Compound (Menzi Barangay) for Swiss and German managers, and at the Alano Compound (Dna. Ramona T. Alano Barangay) as well, precursors of modern-day subdivisions and exclusive gated communities in the Philippines.

===The Moro uprising===
The Moro uprising of 1971 affected Basilan&#x27;s economy. It was led by Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) originating from Sulu, headed by University of the Philippines lecturer Nur Misuari. This was compounded by the declaration of martial law by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, and the decree that created Basilan Province, with its initial complement of ten municipalities (eventually reduced to seven).

Politics took center stage, and the resurgent Yakan uplanders found themselves battling the Tausug lowlanders and their allies. The incessant Yakan-Tausug pocket battles throughout the 1980s culminated in the burning of Isabela City&#x27;s downtown market in 1987. After several revenge killings, Basilan gained notoriety as the Philippines&#x27; &quot;Wild, Wild West&quot;. By then, Basilan&#x27;s economy, along with that of the rest of the nation, was limping along, barely surviving the aftermath of these struggles.

===Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program and the rise of Abu Sayyaf===
At the onset of the post-Marcos administration of Corazon Aquino, another blow was dealt to Basilan&#x27;s economy. In 1988, Congress passed a law establishing the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), which inaugurated a land distribution program, effectively dissolving nearly all of the corporate plantations on the island. CARP applied to Basilan&#x27;s large multi-national plantations despite the plantation workers&#x27; misgivings and the landowners&#x27; objections. Almost immediately, the large multi-national corporations withdrew their investments from Basilan, leaving their plantations to ill-equipped farmer beneficiaries, who managed operations in a farmers cooperative format.

The J. S. Alano coconut plantation was converted into the Tairan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association and Multi-Purpose Cooperative (TARBAMC), the University of the Philippines Basilan Land Grant into the Santa Clara Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Integrated Development Cooperative (SCARBIDC), and the American Rubber (B.F. Goodrich) rubber plantation was converted into the Latuan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association Inc. (LARBAI). The vast tracts of the Enrile-owned Cocoland Plantation, was redistributed as the Lamitan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative (LARBECO). A number of other Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperatives have likewise taken over most of the small to mid-sized plantations on the island.

The Philippine government&#x27;s initial rapprochement with the Nur Misuari-led Moro National Liberation Front throughout the 1980s established the 7,281-hectare Basilan Resettlement Area which was set aside for MNLF rebel-returnees and their communities located on the western slopes of Basilan Peak, mostly in northern Sumisip, but also in southern Isabela, and northeastern Maluso. This vast area was eventually subdivided into four Agrarian Reform Cooperatives, all of which were established in 1991.

By the early 1990s, disgruntled youth, influenced by returning mujahideen warriors from the thwarted Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and schooled in more radical schools of thought in Syria, Egypt and Pakistan, banded together to form the Al-Harakatul Al-Islamiyah, better known worldwide as Abu Sayyaf, an extremist group advocating strict Islamic governance similar to Afghanistan&#x27;s Taliban regime. This group initiated test raids, kidnappings, ambushes and assassinations in some of the most vulnerable communities inland, causing the dispersal of these communities and total breakdown of the inland economy.

As more and more of the group&#x27;s pioneering leaders were captured or gunned down, the group gradually transformed from being radical ideologues to becoming plain lawless elements or bandits, prone to committing heinous crimes, usually kidnapping for ransom and bombings throughout Mindanao, Palawan (Dos Palmas) and even Malaysia (Sipadan Is.).

The group&#x27;s founding leader, the radical firebrand Abdurajak Janjalani of Isabela City, is a typical product of Basilan&#x27;s closely mixed ethnicities and inter-marriages: he is part-Tausug, part-Yakan and part-Ilonggo.

===Inclusion in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao===
The Organic Act for the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was passed into law in 1989. A plebiscite held in 14 Mindanao provinces was held in the same year. Basilan initially opted out of the autonomous region. Only Maguindanao (without Cotabato City), Lanao del Sur (without Marawi City), Sulu and Tawi-Tawi joined the ARMM.

More than a decade later, in 2001, a new law expanding the ARMM was passed, and a plebiscite was subsequently held. While Basilan&#x27;s five Muslim municipalities (Maluso, Sumisip, Lantawan, Tipo-Tipo, Tuburan) opted to join the expanded ARMM, residents of the Christian areas of Isabela City and Lamitan Municipality, chose not to. Even then, only Isabela was not included in the expanded ARMM, having been granted cityhood earlier in the same year. Lamitan joined the five other municipalities, as Basilan was officially incorporated into the expanded ARMM.

Widespread corruption in the ARMM, compounded by corruption at the municipal and provincial levels, further eroded business confidence in the island. This, plus the surge of terrorist activities carried out by Abu Sayyaf and their Jemaah Islamiyah cohorts in the international terrorist network of Al-Qaeda, weakened Basilan&#x27;s economy further.

The hostage crisis of 2001 further raised questions about Basilan&#x27;s economic future. Operations by Abu Sayyaf damaged prospects for investment and tourism. However, an increased presence by the Philippine and U.S. militaries through the Balikatan 02-1 Joint Military Exercises and the subsequent death of Abu Sayyaf leaders Khadafi Abubakar Janjalani and Aldam Tilao (aka Abu Sabaya), were followed by investments by the United States through USAID. Projects include the Basilan Tuburan Road Improvement Project and improvements to Lamitan and Maluso Ports. Smaller barangay infrastructure projects, intended to help boost economic growth, are also under development. For instance, authorities are building farm-to-market roads, community and trade centers, water projects, and pedestrian bridges, according to USAID information.

A number of other ODA-funded Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and People&#x27;s Organizations (POs) flooded Basilan starting in 2002. These NGOs and POs provided much-needed capital infusion for local entrepreneurs to restart defunct or dying business enterprises. Likewise, improved training and government-funded support were extended to decade-old Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperatives, effectively improving productivity levels and crop yields. Extensive farm management training in these &quot;Coop&quot; areas have likewise improved business efficiency in the cooperatives.

Currently, Basilan&#x27;s minimum wage is US$3.20/day for non-agriculture related jobs, and US$2.80/day for agriculture related jobs. There are only 1,203 registered Overseas Contract Workers from Basilan.

===Return of rubber===

By 2003, Basilan embarked on large-scale replanting programs covering some of privately owned and/or cooperative-controlled lands, mainly for rubber and cassava. , the province had planted, of which were owned by individual farmers and the rest by cooperatives. The exact land area devoted to rubber could reach over , as there are hundreds of unrecorded small rubber growers and farmers. The provincial government reports that almost half or are immature, about a fifth or is classed as &quot;less-productive&quot;, and a little under a third or is described as &quot;productive.&quot;

A consortium of agrarian reform beneficiaries has been formed to improve quality and increase production. The Isla Corridor Consortium Agrarian Reform Communities not only sees itself as reviving the rubber industry, it also wants to help in the transformation of the battle-scarred province. The consortium, composed of the United Workers Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Multipurpose Cooperative, Lamitan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative, Santa Clara, and the Latuan Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association, Inc., accounts for a total area of about , some 80% of which is planted with rubber trees.

===Coconut===
Although it is still the biggest single crop produced in the province, coconut/copra production annually was only 193,848 metric tons in 2003, down from its peak production of 189,297,937 metric tons just two years before. Coconut plantations and small coconut farms cover more than , all of which are classified as &quot;productive&quot; to &quot;mature&quot; areas. However, province-wide coconut production, which still accounts for 50%-60% of the province&#x27;s total economic activity, has dropped precipitously to only 174,939 metric tons in 2002 due to the lingering effects of CARP, combined with a severe onset of the El Niño weather pattern, the worsening threat to peace and order resulting from the resurgent Abu Sayyaf terrorist group and their MILF allies, and the policy of the Akbar administration to replace coconut with rubber trees.

Coconut plantations began to revive in 2006, owing to the steep rise in copra prices. A comprehensive replanting and rehabilitation program is currently being implemented by the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) and the Department of Agriculture for the resuscitation of the island&#x27;s copra production industry, once the Philippine&#x27;s second-largest copra exporter after Quezon Province in Luzon. To date, however, coconut production in the province, rapidly being replaced by rubber plantations, has remained in the doldrums despite the government&#x27;s best efforts to revive the ailing sector, such as PCA incentives to coconut farmers.

===Other products===

Basilan&#x27;s extensive coastline hosts seafarers and fishers, almost all of them Tausugs, Samals and Bajaus, who have been engaged in fishing for several centuries. Annual Basilan fish production is limited to 28,073 metric tons due to resistance to the modernizing of their fishing fleets.

Only 2,945 metric tons of palay (rice) are produced in Basilan&#x27;s mostly rolling terrain. Corn production is 1,333 metric tons, bananas 20,458 metric tons, and mangos 211 metric tons.

There are 155,541 chickens, 5,085 ducks, 7,803 carabaos (water buffalo), 2,724 cattle, 14,470 goats, and 14,700 hogs.

===Banking and finance===

Banks based in Basilan have a total deposit base of more than Php764,500,000. The city hosts at least 27 pawnshop operations, each of whom has an average of three branches, mostly located in Isabela City, Lamitan, and Maluso Townsite.

The province is also serviced by satellite offices of government financing institutions such as the Social Security System and the Government Service Insurance System.

The Basilan business sector is represented by the Philippine Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, Inc.-Basilan Chamber (PCCI-Basilan), organized in 1975, the only business support organization duly affiliated with the Philippine Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, Inc. (PCCI), with 95% of its members being composed of small and medium enterprises, and offices mostly in Isabela City and Lamitan, but with business assets and operations throughout the island. A number of smaller business groups have since been established catering to the needs of businessmen from specific ethnic or religious affiliations.

===Utilities, infrastructure and health===
Basilan&#x27;s electricity needs are served by the Basilan Electric Cooperative, powered by three diesel-powered electricity generating plants located at Barangay Binuangan, Isabela, one National Power Corporation diesel-powered barge located at Barangay Tabuk, Isabela, and two mini-hydroelectric plants located in Kumalarang, Isabela and Balagtasan, Lamitan. A total of 62 sitios, in 42 barangays spread out in 6 municipalities still do not have access to electricity. Only about 38% of Barangays are sufficiently powered for modern needs, and most of these are located in the cities of Isabela and Lamitan, and Maluso Municipality. Rates are currently pegged at US$0.824/kwH (Php11.42/kwH), one of the highest in the country. Basilan has a total electricity demand of 8.8MW (peak hours), and has a total reliable electricity supply of only 7.4MW, thus resulting in one of the country&#x27;s longest intermittent blackout spells, running for several years now.

Basilan is served by three local water utilities: Isabela City Water District, Lamitan City Water District, and Maluso Water District. Only 17,693 households, however, have full access to safe and potable water. Current rates are pegged at an average US$3.20/month (+US$0.0826/10 cu.m.)

The island is served by the Provincial Telephone System, which has 600 land-line connections and connected with National Direct Dial via the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company. It is also served by major mobile telecommunications carriers Globe Telecommunications and Smart Communications. It has two Wi-Fi internet Service provider, and numerous internet cafes.
National roads (concrete, asphalt, gravel) total , while there are of local roads. There are 13 municipal and local ports, three of which have roll-on/roll-off capability, and at least ten private airstrips servicing small aircraft. Major bridges are the Marcos Bridge of Isabela and the recently inaugurated Matarling Bridge (built through USAID funding) between Isabela and Lantawan.

There are 394 Barangay Health Workers and four private hospitals: the Juan S. Alano Memorial Hospital (formerly Basilan Hospital), Infante Hospital, Basilan Community Hospital, all in Isabela, and the Dr. Jose Ma. Torres Hospital in Lamitan. There are also four government-run hospitals: Basilan General Hospital and Isabela City Infirmary, both located in Isabela City, the Lamitan District Hospital in Lamitan City, and the Sumisip District Hospital in Luuk-Bait, Sumisip Municipality.

==Tourism==
Architectural landmarks include the Santa Isabel Cathedral, the Calvario Peak, on which the Chapel of Peace stands, and the Kaum Purnah Mosque. Natural attractions include the lake in the Panigayan fishing village, Sumagdang Beach and the waterfalls of the Kumalarang River.

* Old Basilan Provincial Capitol, site of Fort Isabela II. The original fort was bombed and destroyed towards the end of World War II, having been used by the occupying Japanese forces as a munitions dump. A newer Capitol Building was built on the spot where the old Basilan City Hall stood after it was burned in the early 1990s. The new building is a celebration of Muslim and Christian influences which shaped modern-day Basilan, and still occupies the highest point of the city proper.
* Isabela City Plaza (formerly Plaza Misericordia) /Plaza Rizal. The twin plazas of the city have remained at the very center of Basilan&#x27;s socio-political scene to this very day.

* Lami-Lamihan Festival, the island&#x27;s premier festival, is celebrated during the Feast of St. Peter (Fiesta San Pedro) on June 29 in Lamitan City. The festival is highlighted by the Yakans, who attend the festivities in full regalia, selling wares and produce brought in from their farms in the interior.
* &#x27;Cocowayan&#x27; Festival, Isabela&#x27;s annual commemoration of its cityhood, is a week-long series of activities culminating in the annual Street Dancing parade on April 25.
* Fiesta Santa Isabel, celebrated every July 8 by the residents of Isabela, in honor of its Patroness Saint, Elizabeth of Portugal (Span. Santa Isabel de Portugal). The focal point of the celebrations is the Santa Isabel Cathedral, located at the center of Isabela City. This is highlighted by a procession and novena masses, the traditional Bella Isabela Beauty Pageant, a marathon, a regatta and other activities organized primarily by the Diocese of Basilan and the Prelature of Isabela and its lay organizations, the Catholic Women&#x27;s League and the Knights of Columbus.
* Semana Santa (Holy Week), celebrated in March/April (movable). A city procession known as the Santo Entierro (Holy Funeral) on Good Friday highlights the observance of Lent. Celebrated in most parish churches in the city and in the Santa Isabel Cathedral, the Santo Entierro is a procession of Christ&#x27;s images, many of the Stations of the Cross along the city&#x27;s main streets, depicting his last hours before, during, and after the Crucifixion.

* Chinese New Year, celebrated every February (movable) mostly for the raucous noise-making, tikoy-eating marathons, and the much-anticipated distribution of &quot;ampaw&quot; by rich Chinese godparents.

==Government==
Basilan&#x27;s politics has been dictated by its economics. Whereas only 33% of the island&#x27;s residents originate from Christian tribes in the Visayas and Luzon, this group owns 70% of the island&#x27;s developed arable agricultural land (private ownership or cooperatives as farmer beneficiaries). The Yakan tribe, comprising 41% of the island&#x27;s population, has full control of local governments outside of Isabela and Lamitan. The Tausugs, Samals and Bajaus, forming 25% of the population, control nearly 90% of the island&#x27;s aquatic harvest, while the minuscule Chinese segment of the population controls nearly 100% of all commodity trading and commerce activities, especially in the bigger cities.

This volatile mix of ethnic and religious groups have defined political realignments in the island for most of its history. The Christian tribes, traditionally allied with the Tausugs, controlled Basilan politics until the 1980s, when the Yakans, aided by their almost absolute control of the hinterlands and the disappearance of the multi-national plantations, scored upset victories in electoral contests starting in 1988.

This political combine has since seen some in-fighting from two of the most formidable power blocks to have formed since the 2004 general elections. Both blocks went head-to-head in the 2007, 2010 and 2013 local elections with mixed results.

The Akbar block (Liberal Party - Atienza Wing &amp; Lakas-CMD/Kampi) was led by the late Wahab Akbar, three-term Basilan governor and clan patriarch, together with his wives, and his nephews and nieces, all of whom won mayoral posts in all the municipalities as well as Isabela City, which is under his second wife Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar. Hja. Jum Jainuddin-Akbar, the incumbent three-term Governor of Basilan assumed the leadership of the block after Wahab Akbar himself, who was elected congressman in 2007, was assassinated in November 13 of that year. Cases were filed against Gerry Salapuddin ang Mujiv Hataman, having been accused of having master-minded the assassination. The 2013 Elections proved the staying power of the Akbars as the clan, celebrating the twin victories of both Governor Jum and Mayor Cherry, heralded the election of Alfiya Akbar-Fernandez, eldest daughter of Gov. Akbar, as the top-notcher Provincial Board Member for District 1, and Al Qaid Akbar, eldest son, who won as Isabela City Councilor. The Akbars won all of their electoral contests since 1998. Gov. Jum Akbar won in all Cities and Municipalities in Basilan, except Hdji. Muhtamad (Pilas) in the last election, with an electoral landslide of over 60,000 votes against her only opponent. This is her third and final term as governor. Mayor Cherry Santos-Akbar likewise won handily in Isabela for a third and final term in that City.

The Hataman block (Liberal Party) - Roxas/Aquino Wing) is led by Mujiv Hataman, elected Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in 2013, a close friend and ally of Philippine President Benigno Simeon Aquino III. He is joined by his brother, Rep. Hajiman Hataman-Salliman, Congressman of the Lone District of Basilan, and his wife, Sitti Djalia Turabin-Hataman who won a seat as a Party-list representative in Congress, representing Anak Mindanao Party-list. They are joined by a number of clan members who likewise won local positions, especially in their bailiwick of Sumisip Municipality in Basilan. The Hatamans can boast of a mixed bag of electoral victories and defeats since 2004. Mujiv Hataman is in his first term as Regional Governor of ARMM, Cong. Jim Salliman is on his second term as Representative, and Cong. Sitti Djalia Hataman is on her first.

The Salapuddin block (Lakas-CMD/Kampi) is led by Abdulgani &quot;Gerry&quot; Salapuddin, three-term governor, three-term congressman and two-term Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. To him, the 2007, 2010 and 2013 elections proved to be a débâcle, as he and his daughter - Rabia Salapuddin (who ran for governor in 2013) lost on all fronts. The Salapuddins have lost all elections since 2007.

The Akbars and Hatamans forged a political alliance in 2012, paving the way for the appointment of Mujiv Hataman to the top post at the ARMM. The criminal case against Hataman was voluntarily dropped by the Akbars in 2012, while the Supreme Court threw out the case filed against Salapuddin in 2013. Both Akbar and Hataman coalitions are currently affiliated with the Liberal Party of the Philippines, led by President Aquino. Salapuddin has remained with Lakas-CMD.

===Recent local elections===

As a result of the 2010 Synchronized National and Local Elections, three major factions emerged: the Akbar block, still formidable, albeit splintered and severely weakened from within after the assassination of clan patriarch, Rep. Wahab Akbar, of the Administration Lakas-Kampi-CMD; the Hataman block, suddenly a potent force to be reckoned with province-wide, under the new administration&#x27;s Liberal Party; and a third force headed by former Akbar ally and Ungkaya Pukan Mayor Joel T. Maturan, of the Nacionalista Party and former Lakas-CMD stalwart Salapuddin.

Incumbent governor Hja. Jum Jainuddin-Akbar won the gubernatorial race, defeating Mujiv Hataman, with Ungkaya Pukan Mayor and former Akbar ally Joel T. Maturan trailing far behind. The lone congressional district of Basilan, on the other hand, was won by Hajiman Salliman Hataman (LP), who had been defeated by Wahab Akbar in 2007, followed closely by former Deputy Speaker Abdulghani Salapuddin (NP), Lantawan Mayor and Wahab Akbar&#x27;s niece, Tahira Ismael-Sansawi (PMP), Maluso Mayor Sakib Salajin (Lakas-Kampi-CMD), also a nephew of Wahab Akbar and Rajam M. Akbar, Wahab Akbar&#x27;s sister.

In the cities, incumbents Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar (Lakas-Kampi-CMD) of Isabela and Roderick Furigay (LDP) of Lamitan both won their respective contests. Isabela City&#x27;s vice mayoral race proved to be hotly contested, with Tabuk Barangay Chairman Abdulbaki Ajibon winning over the incumbent in a close fight. Lamitan&#x27;s incumbent Vice Mayor Arleigh Eisma ran unopposed.

The election season once again witnessed a spike in crime, most noticeably a rise in kidnappings, assassinations and ambuscades. On January 29, 2009, at 5:00pm, Al Barka Mayor Karam Jakilan was felled in an ambush, together with two of his personal bodyguards. Earlier, a slew of assassinations in both the Akbar and Hataman camps, most prominently an Akbar henchman and two Hataman cousins, commenced early in 2008. Also, a spate of kidnaps for ransom have been widely observed to peak as election season nears.

On April 13, 2010, two bomb blasts rocked Isabela, the first at the Basilan National High School Grandstand Oval, the second right beside Santa Isabel Cathedral. A third controlled explosion was detonated by elements of the Philippine National Police Bomb Squad a few meters from the Isabela City Hall. This was followed by the massacre of twelve residents of Theresa Heights Subdivision, Barangay Eastside, as the bombers, purportedly members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf, escaped from a porous Philippine military cordon.

Local elections have been widely fraught with massive cheating, vote buying and fraud as well. Blame could not be assigned to one particular group or political block alone, as this has been a &quot;common practice&quot; across the political spectrum. The May 2010 automated elections turned out to be no different, with Basilan being designated an &quot;Election Hotspot&quot; by the Philippines&#x27; Election Commission. Violent confrontations between political supporters of rival parties, and the failure of Board of Election Inspectors in two villages in Maluso and Al-Barka Municipalities forced authorities to declare a &quot;Failure of Elections&quot; in these parts. Special elections were conducted in these villages on June 3, 2010, where incidents of fraud and minor scuffles were again observed.

May 2013 saw a rematch between the Akbar Block (led by incumbent governor, Jum Jainuddin-Akbar, now affiliated with the administration Liberal Party - LP), against Salapuddin (led by a young Rabia Salapuddin, daughter of former governor and Congressman Abdulgani &quot;Gerry&quot; Salapuddin, Lakas-CMD).

In this electoral contest, the Akbars allied with erstwhile political rivals, the Hatamans (led by Mujiv Hataman, who ran as Regional Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and his brother, Rep. Jim Hataman-Salliman, Liberal Party), resulting in one of the most lop-sided election landslides in recent memory. Governor Akbar won her re-election bid with a record-breaking 60,000-vote margin against her only challenger, the younger Salapuddin. She is joined by Vice Governor Keemhar Jay Reynon Sakkalahul (LP) who bested a field of five Vice-Gubernatorial contenders. The son of former Basilan Vice Governor Al-Rasheed Sakkalahul, the new Vice Governor is currently the youngest Vice Governor in the Philippines, at 23 years old. Mayor Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar also won another lopsided victory in Isabela City.

The Akbar Block has likewise added two new contenders, the Governor&#x27;s children - daughter Alfiya Akbar-Fernandez - who topped the Provincial Board Members&#x27; tally for District I, while son Al Qaid Akbar managed a third-place debut in local politics as an Isabela City Councilor. The provincial sweep of the Liberal Party was complete in 2013. All winning Provincial Board Members, from Districts 1 and 2 came from the LP, while 11 of 13 Mayors are LP members.

LP ARMM Standard-bearer Mujiv Hataman also won his own contest in the autonomous region - making him the first Basileño to win the region&#x27;s top post in an election. LP re-electionist Congressman Jim Hataman-Salliman, his brother, likewise reclaimed his seat in Congress. Moreover, Basilan-founded Anak Mindanao Party-list is returned to the House of Representatives, with Mujiv Hataman&#x27;s wife, Sitti Djalia Turabin Hataman, becoming a Party-list Representative. Elder brother Gulam Hataman is returned unopposed as Sumisip Mayor.

===Bellwether Province===
In the last five presidential elections, Basilan voted for Ferdinand Edralin Marcos (1965, 1969), Corazon Cojuangco Aquino (1986), Fidel Valdez Ramos (1992), Joseph Ejercito Estrada (1998), and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (2004), all of whom won in their respective bids. Similarly, Basilan&#x27;s vice presidential choices, namely Fernando Lopez (1969), Salvador Laurel (1986), Joseph Ejercito Estrada (1992), Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (1998) and Noli De Castro (2004), also won, making it one of the most accurate bellwether provinces in Philippine politics today. Sen. Manuel Roxas II was Basilan&#x27;s Senate top-notcher in 2004, while Sen. Loren Legarda was number one in 2007. The recently conducted May 2010 national/local polls manifested once again Basilan&#x27;s uncanny record of picking the winners, Benigno S. Aquino III (Liberal Party) and Jejomar C. Binay (PDP-Laban) won in the presidential and vice presidential contests in the Province respectively.

However, Basilan has figured prominently in a number of election-related issues in the past, the foremost being its inclusion among the provinces (together with Cebu and the rest of the ARMM provinces) where, allegedly, former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo committed wholesale election fraud to win the 2004 presidential elections. The ensuing imbroglio, dubbed the &quot;Hello Garci&quot; Scandal, included several mentions of Basilan and its late governor, Wahab Akbar, in taped conversations purportedly between President Arroyo and COMELEC Commissioner Virgilio Garcillano.
