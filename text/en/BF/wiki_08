<text>Fernando Arrabal Terán (; ; born August 11, 1932) is a Spanish playwright, screenwriter, film director, novelist, and poet. He was born in Melilla and settled in France in 1955. Regarding his nationality, Arrabal describes himself as &quot;desterrado&quot;, or &quot;half-expatriate, half-exiled&quot;.

Arrabal has directed seven full-length feature films and has published over 100 plays; 14 novels; 800 poetry collections, chapbooks, and artists&#x27; books; several essays; and his notorious &quot;Letter to General Franco&quot; during the dictator&#x27;s lifetime. His complete plays have been published, in multiple languages, in a two-volume edition totaling over two thousand pages. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ theatre critic Mel Gussow has called Arrabal the last survivor among the &quot;three avatars of modernism&quot;.

In 1962, Arrabal co-founded the Panic Movement with Alejandro Jodorowsky and Roland Topor, inspired by the god Pan. He was elected Transcendent Satrap of the Collège de Pataphysique in 1990. Forty other Transcendent Satraps have been elected over the past half-century, including Marcel Duchamp, Eugène Ionesco, Man Ray, Boris Vian, Dario Fo, Umberto Eco, and Jean Baudrillard. Arrabal spent three years as a member of André Breton&#x27;s surrealist group and was a friend of Andy Warhol and Tristan Tzara.

Writer and critic Javier Villan wrote of Arrabal:

== Childhood (1932–1946) ==

Arrabal (Terán is his second family name) was born to Carmen Terán González and painter Fernando Arrabal Ruiz.

On July 17, 1936, when insurrections within the military were staged against the constitutional government of the Second Spanish Republic, launching the Spanish Civil War, Arrabal&#x27;s father remained faithful to the Republic and was sentenced to death for mutiny. His sentence was later commuted to 30 years&#x27; imprisonment. He was transferred between prisons, from Santi Espiritu in Melilla to Monte Hacho in Ceuta, where he attempted suicide, as well as Ciudad Rodrigo and Burgos. On December 4, 1941, he was sent to the Burgos Hospital due to apparent mental disorder. Later research has found that he likely feigned mental order in order to be transferred to a lower security prison. On December 29, 1941, he escaped from the hospital in his pajamas, despite three feet of snow covering the countryside. Despite extensive research, he was never seen again.

About his father, Arrabal has written: &quot;Without trying to compare what is incomparable, when I confront these twilight episodes (and quite often without any logical connection), I often think of that scapegoat, my father. The day on which the Uncivil War began, he was locked up by his &#x27;compassionate companions&#x27; in the flag room of the Melilla military barracks. He was meant to think carefully, since he risked a death sentence for mutiny if he did not join them in their insurrection (alzamiento). After an hour, Lieutenant Fernando Arrabal summoned his ex-comrades – already! – to inform them that he had pondered long enough. Today, because of this precedent, must I serve as witness, example, or symbol, as he did, of the most fundamental occurrences? I, who am a mere exile. If I am taken away from my beloved numerics, everything around me leads to over-the-counter confusion and disorder. I have no wish to be a scapegoat like my father, I only ask to die while still living, whenever Pan so wishes.&quot;

In 1936, Arrabal&#x27;s mother returned to Ciudad Rodrigo with her young son, Fernando, and found a job at Burgos, then-capitol of the Nationalists and headquarters of General Franco&#x27;s government. Fernando was enrolled in a local Catholic school from 1937 until 1940, when the Civil War ended and he moved with his mother to Madrid.

Arrabal was awarded the national prize for gifted children in 1941. He continued his studies at Las Escuelas Pías de San Antón, a church school whose alumni have also included Victor Hugo and Jacinto Benavente y Martínez. Arrabal later studied at another distinguished Madrid school, Colegio Padres Escolapios De Getafe. He was an avid reader and was eager to experience life.

== Youth and young adulthood (1936–1946) ==
In 1947, when his mother ordered him to attend preparatory classes for entrance to the Academia General Militar, Arrabal protested by playing hooky. She subsequently sent him to Tolosa (Gipuzkoa), where he studied business at the Escuela Teórico-Práctica de la Industria y el Comercio del Paper, in 1949. By 1950, he had begun writing several plays, which remain unpublished.

In 1951, Arrabal began working in the paper industry at La Papelera Española. He moved to Valencia and passed his bachillerato, the first non-compulsory educational option in Spain for admission to university. He later moved to Madrid and began legal studies. During these years, he frequented the cultural institution Ateneo de Madrid and heard poets from the Postismo school. He was also finishing his early play &quot;Picnic,&quot; then titled &quot;The Soldiers&quot;, and writing &quot;El triciclo&quot;, at first titled &quot;Men with a Tricycle&quot;.

In 1954, Arrabal hitchhiked to Paris to attend a performance of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; given by the touring Berliner Ensemble. Later that year, in Madrid, he met Luce Moreau, who became his wife. In 1955, he was awarded a three-month scholarship to study in Paris, during which time he lived at the Colegio de España at the Cité Universitaire. While in Paris he suffered a serious relapse of tuberculosis. He considered this disease to be a &quot;lucky mishap&quot; that allowed him to move permanently to his &quot;veritable homeland, that of Kundera and Vives, Saint Ignatius of Loyola and Picasso: exile.&quot; In 1976 he appeared in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s New York film &quot;Underground and Friends&quot;.

== Politics ==

Arrabal had been known for being anti-Francoist and anti-monarchist and interested in anarchist trends in cultural production. Arrabal had a complicated relationship with Communism. He had ties with the Communist Party of Spain during his exile, but a rupture seems to have occurred in 1977 due to a conflict with his play &quot;The Architect and the Emperor of Assyria&quot; being performed in Barcelona with artists reputed to have Communist Party ties.

== Awards and recognition ==
Arrabal was among the more controversial writers of his time, and his work has been recognized internationally. Awards include the Grand Prize for Theatre of the Académie Française, the Premio Mariano de Cavia for journalism, the Nabokov Prize for novels, the Espasa Prize for essays, and the World Theater Prize.

In 2001, he was nominated for the Premio Cervantes by Nobel Prize in Literature winner Camilo José Cela and José Hierro. He was reportedly a finalist for the Nobel Prize in 2005 due to the solicitation of several institutions and individuals. On July 14, 2005, he was named to France&#x27;s Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 2007, he was awarded a doctorate of letters Honoris Causa by the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece.

=== Operas ===
Arrabal&#x27;s opera &quot;Faustbal&quot; with music by Leonardo Balada premiered at the Teatro Real de Madrid on February 13, 2009, staged by the Comediants of Barcelona. Arrabal wrote of the opera, &quot;Faustbal is a woman who, in the third millennium, is the reincarnation of Alfred Jarry&#x27;s Doctor Faustroll, a new doctor Faust who asks God and Lucifer for words and prayers so that love and charity might be unified. Nothing can satisfy the hurricane of her scientific curiosity, nor calm the storms of her desires. A genius, very beautiful, and enriched by her transports and transfigurations, she vows a torrid love for her Amazon. She leaps between galaxies while the war to end all civilization rages, and moves through space at supersonic speed. Confronting her, Margarito, supreme leader of the armed forces, dons the armor of brutal, electronic repression. He is madly in love with Faustbal under the sky&#x27;s cupola. He tries to possess her through the torrent of his tower, employing the services of Mephistopheles himself. Jesús López Cobos, music director of the Teatro Real de Madrid, will conduct the world premiere, which will be sung by sopranos Ana Ibarra and María Rodríguez. The mezzo-soprano Cecilia Diaz will sing the role of the Amazon, while tenors Gerhard Siegel and Eduardo Santamaría will be the two Margaritos, bass Stefano Palatchi will perform the role of God, and baritones Tomas Tomasson and Lauri Vasar will be Mephistopheles.&quot;

Four other operas with Arrabal&#x27;s librettos have been staged, and the author describes them as &quot;always having been as complex, yet suffering from as few complexes, as did &quot;Faustbal&quot;.&quot; They are:

*&quot;Apokaliptica&quot;, music by Milko Kelemen.
*&quot;L&#x27;opéra de la Bastille&quot;, music by Marcel Landowski
*&quot;Picknick im Felde&quot;, music by Constantinos Stylianou
*&quot;Guernica&quot;, music by Ostfiend Busing

In October 1985, Arrabal made his debut as an opera stage director at the Opéra Royal de Belgique, where he directed Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;La vida breve&quot; and Enrique Granados&#x27; &quot;Goyescas&quot;. &quot;Of course,&quot; Arrabal commented, &quot;under my direction the onstage chorus was nude, or to be more precise, panically covered with clay.&quot;

In 1994, Chamber Made produced the opera of Arrabal&#x27;s&quot;The Two Executioners&quot;, with libretto by Douglas Horton and music by David Chesworth. The opera ran for two seasons in Melbourne, 1994 and 1996 at the Malthouse Theatre. Australia&#x27;s &quot;The Independent Monthly&quot; wrote, &quot;Easily the most impressive and memorable piece of music theatre in 1994.&quot;

* &quot;Fando and Lis&quot; (1971) directed by Franz Marijnen
* &quot;Dos Obras de Arrabal&quot; (1972) directed by Delfor Peralta
* &quot;The Architect and the Emperor of Assyria&quot; (1976) directed by Tom O&#x27;Horgan
* &quot;The Architect and the Emperor of Assyria&quot; (1977) directed by Tom O&#x27;Horgan
* &quot;Dance/Theater of Richard S. Bach&quot; (1984) choreographed by Richard S. Bach

A traveling company from La MaMa also took &quot;The Architect and the Emperor of Assyria&quot; on tour to Philadelphia, Amsterdam, Venezuela, and Taormina in 1977–1979.

For a more extensive list of productions of Arrabal&#x27;s plays, see his official website.

=== Paintings ===
* Arrabal has described himself as a &quot;frustrated painter&quot;. He has produced approximately 50 canvases and 100 drawings and collages, which have been exhibited in museums such as the Paris Art Center, Musée de Bayeux, and the Villa San Carlo Borromeo Art Museum in Milan.
* His approach to painting involves close collaboration with artists who produce large-format oil paintings based on the detailed sketches he provides.
* In 1962, his first painting was chosen for reproduction in the art publication &quot;La Brèche: Action Surréaliste Revue&quot; by its founding editor, André Breton.
* Arrabal has collaborated with sculptor and video artist Christèle Jacob, with whom he has created a dozen videos and photomontage series, including &quot;Les artilleurs des échecs et de la littérature&quot; (The artillery corps of chess and literature), inspired by a 1909 artwork by Henri Rousseau.

=== Interest in chess ===
Arrabal has a strong interest in chess and has attended many chess tournaments. He is close to American chess Grandmaster Gata Kamsky and advocated for Kamsky on his chess blog during Kamsky&#x27;s negotiations with FIDE over a World Chess Championship match.

For over thirty years, Arrabal has written a column on chess for the French weekly news magazine L&#x27;Express. His columns have included, among many others:

*&quot;Echecs et mythes&quot;
*&quot;Fêtes et défaites sur l&#x27;échiquier&quot;
*&quot;Les échecs féériques et libertaires&quot;
*&quot;Bobby Fischer: el rey maldito&quot;

<doc id="294185" wikidata="Q1970172" url="?curid=294185" title="Von Neumann algebra">
<text>In mathematics, a von Neumann algebra or W*-algebra is a *-algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that is closed in the weak operator topology and contains the identity operator. It is a special type of C*-algebra.

Von Neumann algebras were originally introduced by John von Neumann, motivated by his study of single operators, group representations, ergodic theory and quantum mechanics. His double commutant theorem shows that the analytic definition is equivalent to a purely algebraic definition as an algebra of symmetries.

Two basic examples of von Neumann algebras are as follows:
*The ring formula_1 of essentially bounded measurable functions on the real line is a commutative von Neumann algebra, whose elements act as multiplication operators by pointwise multiplication on the Hilbert space formula_2 of square-integrable functions.
*The algebra formula_3 of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space formula_4 is a von Neumann algebra, non-commutative if the Hilbert space has dimension at least formula_5.

Von Neumann algebras were first studied by in 1929; he and Francis Murray developed the basic theory, under the original name of rings of operators, in a series of papers written in the 1930s and 1940s (; ), reprinted in the collected works of .

Introductory accounts of von Neumann algebras are given in the online notes of and and the books by , , and . The three volume work by gives an encyclopedic account of the theory. The book by discusses more advanced topics.

==Definitions==
There are three common ways to define von Neumann algebras.

The first and most common way is to define them as weakly closed *-algebras of bounded operators (on a Hilbert space) containing the identity. In this definition the weak (operator) topology can be replaced by many other common topologies including the strong, ultrastrong or ultraweak operator topologies. The *-algebras of bounded operators that are closed in the norm topology are C*-algebras, so in particular any von Neumann algebra is a C*-algebra.

The second definition is that a von Neumann algebra is a subalgebra of the bounded operators closed under involution (the *-operation) and equal to its double commutant, or equivalently the commutant of some subalgebra closed under *. The von Neumann double commutant theorem says that the first two definitions are equivalent.

The first two definitions describe a von Neumann algebra concretely as a set of operators acting on some given Hilbert space. showed that von Neumann algebras can also be defined abstractly as C*-algebras that have a predual; in other words the von Neumann algebra, considered as a Banach space, is the dual of some other Banach space called the predual. The predual of a von Neumann algebra is in fact unique up to isomorphism. Some authors use &quot;von Neumann algebra&quot; for the algebras together with a Hilbert space action, and &quot;W*-algebra&quot; for the abstract concept, so a von Neumann algebra is a W*-algebra together with a Hilbert space and a suitable faithful unital action on the Hilbert space. The concrete and abstract definitions of a von Neumann algebra are similar to the concrete and abstract definitions of a C*-algebra, which can be defined either as norm-closed *-algebras of operators on a Hilbert space, or as Banach *-algebras such that ||&quot;aa*&quot;||=||&quot;a&quot;|| ||&quot;a*&quot;||.

==Terminology==
Some of the terminology in von Neumann algebra theory can be confusing, and the terms often have different meanings outside the subject.

*A factor is a von Neumann algebra with trivial center, i.e. a center consisting only of scalar operators.
*A finite von Neumann algebra is one which is the direct integral of finite factors (meaning the von Neumann algebra has a faithful normal tracial state formula_6). Similarly, properly infinite von Neumann algebras are the direct integral of properly infinite factors.
*A von Neumann algebra that acts on a separable Hilbert space is called separable. Note that such algebras are rarely separable in the norm topology.
*The von Neumann algebra generated by a set of bounded operators on a Hilbert space is the smallest von Neumann algebra containing all those operators.
*The tensor product of two von Neumann algebras acting on two Hilbert spaces is defined to be the von Neumann algebra generated by their algebraic tensor product, considered as operators on the Hilbert space tensor product of the Hilbert spaces.

By forgetting about the topology on a von Neumann algebra, we can consider it a (unital) *-algebra, or just a ring. Von Neumann algebras are semihereditary: every finitely generated submodule of a projective module is itself projective. There have been several attempts to axiomatize the underlying rings of von Neumann algebras, including Baer *-rings and AW*-algebras. The *-algebra of affiliated operators of a finite von Neumann algebra is a von Neumann regular ring. (The von Neumann algebra itself is in general not von Neumann regular.)

== Commutative von Neumann algebras ==
The relationship between commutative von Neumann algebras and measure spaces is analogous to that between commutative C*-algebras and locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Every commutative von Neumann algebra is isomorphic to &quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;X&quot;) for some measure space (&quot;X&quot;, μ) and conversely, for every σ-finite measure space &quot;X&quot;, the *-algebra &quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;X&quot;) is a von Neumann algebra.

Due to this analogy, the theory of von Neumann algebras has been called noncommutative measure theory, while the theory of C*-algebras is sometimes called noncommutative topology .

== Projections ==
Operators &quot;E&quot; in a von Neumann algebra for which &quot;E&quot; = &quot;EE&quot; = &quot;E*&quot; are called projections; they are exactly the operators which give an orthogonal projection of &quot;H&quot; onto some closed subspace. A subspace of the Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; is said to belong to the von Neumann algebra &quot;M&quot; if it is the image of some projection in &quot;M&quot;. This establishes a 1:1 correspondence between projections of &quot;M&quot; and subspaces that belong to &quot;M&quot;. Informally these are the closed subspaces that can be described using elements of &quot;M&quot;, or that &quot;M&quot; &quot;knows&quot; about.

It can be shown that the closure of the image of any operator in &quot;M&quot; and the kernel of any operator in &quot;M&quot; belongs to &quot;M&quot;. Also, the closure of the image under an operator of &quot;M&quot; of any subspace belonging to &quot;M&quot; also belongs to &quot;M&quot;. (These results are a consequence of the polar decomposition).

===Comparison theory of projections===
The basic theory of projections was worked out by . Two subspaces belonging to &quot;M&quot; are called (Murray–von Neumann) equivalent if there is a partial isometry mapping the first isomorphically onto the other that is an element of the von Neumann algebra (informally, if &quot;M&quot; &quot;knows&quot; that the subspaces are isomorphic). This induces a natural equivalence relation on projections by defining &quot;E&quot; to be equivalent to &quot;F&quot; if the corresponding subspaces are equivalent, or in other words if there is a partial isometry of &quot;H&quot; that maps the image of &quot;E&quot; isometrically to the image of &quot;F&quot; and is an element of the von Neumann algebra. Another way of stating this is that &quot;E&quot; is equivalent to &quot;F&quot; if &quot;E=uu*&quot; and &quot;F=u*u&quot; for some partial isometry &quot;u&quot; in &quot;M&quot;.

The equivalence relation ~ thus defined is additive in the following sense: Suppose &quot;E&quot;1 ~ &quot;F&quot;1 and &quot;E&quot;2 ~ &quot;F&quot;2. If &quot;E&quot;1 ⊥ &quot;E&quot;2 and &quot;F&quot;1 ⊥ &quot;F&quot;2, then &quot;E&quot;1 + &quot;E&quot;2 ~ &quot;F&quot;1 + &quot;F&quot;2. Additivity would &quot;not&quot; generally hold if one were to require unitary equivalence in the definition of ~, i.e. if we say &quot;E&quot; is equivalent to &quot;F&quot; if &quot;u*Eu&quot; = &quot;F&quot; for some unitary &quot;u&quot;. The Schröder–Bernstein theorems for operator algebras gives a sufficient condition for Murray-von Neumann equivalence. 

The subspaces belonging to &quot;M&quot; are partially ordered by inclusion, and this induces a partial order ≤ of projections. There is also a natural partial order on the set of &quot;equivalence classes&quot; of projections, induced by the partial order ≤ of projections. If &quot;M&quot; is a factor, ≤ is a total order on equivalence classes of projections, described in the section on traces below.

A projection (or subspace belonging to &quot;M&quot;) &quot;E&quot; is said to be a finite projection if there is no projection &quot;F&quot; &lt; &quot;E&quot; (meaning &quot;F&quot; ≤ &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; ≠ &quot;E&quot;) that is equivalent to &quot;E&quot;. For example, all finite-dimensional projections (or subspaces) are finite (since isometries between Hilbert spaces leave the dimension fixed), but the identity operator on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space is not finite in the von Neumann algebra of all bounded operators on it, since it is isometrically isomorphic to a proper subset of itself. However it is possible for infinite dimensional subspaces to be finite.

Orthogonal projections are noncommutative analogues of indicator functions in &quot;L&quot;∞(R). &quot;L&quot;∞(R) is the ||·||∞-closure of the subspace generated by the indicator functions. Similarly, a von Neumann algebra is generated by its projections; this is a consequence of the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators.

The projections of a finite factor form a continuous geometry.

== Factors ==
A von Neumann algebra &quot;N&quot; whose center consists only of multiples of the identity operator is called a factor. As showed, every von Neumann algebra on a separable Hilbert space is isomorphic to a direct integral of factors. This decomposition is essentially unique. Thus, the problem of classifying isomorphism classes of von Neumann algebras on separable Hilbert spaces can be reduced to that of classifying isomorphism classes of factors.

 showed that every factor has one of 3 types as described below. The type classification can be extended to von Neumann algebras that are not factors, and a von Neumann algebra is of type X if it can be decomposed as a direct integral of type X factors; for example, every commutative von Neumann algebra has type I1. Every von Neumann algebra can be written uniquely as a sum of von Neumann algebras of types I, II, and III.

There are several other ways to divide factors into classes that are sometimes used:

* A factor is called discrete (or occasionally tame) if it has type I, and continuous (or occasionally wild) if it has type II or III.
* A factor is called semifinite if it has type I or II, and purely infinite if it has type III.
* A factor is called finite if the projection 1 is finite and properly infinite otherwise. Factors of types I and II may be either finite or properly infinite, but factors of type III are always properly infinite.

===Type I factors===
A factor is said to be of type I if there is a minimal projection &quot;E ≠ 0&quot;, i.e. a projection &quot;E&quot; such that there is no other projection &quot;F&quot; with 0 &lt; &quot;F&quot; &lt; &quot;E&quot;. Any factor of type I is isomorphic to the von Neumann algebra of &quot;all&quot; bounded operators on some Hilbert space; since there is one Hilbert space for every cardinal number, isomorphism classes of factors of type I correspond exactly to the cardinal numbers. Since many authors consider von Neumann algebras only on separable Hilbert spaces, it is customary to call the bounded operators on a Hilbert space of finite dimension &quot;n&quot; a factor of type I&quot;n&quot;, and the bounded operators on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, a factor of type I∞.

===Type II factors===
A factor is said to be of type II if there are no minimal projections but there are non-zero finite projections. This implies that every projection &quot;E&quot; can be &quot;halved&quot; in the sense that there are two projections &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; that are Murray–von Neumann equivalent and satisfy &quot;E&quot; = &quot;F&quot; + &quot;G&quot;. If the identity operator in a type II factor is finite, the factor is said to be of type II1; otherwise, it is said to be of type II∞. The best understood factors of type II are the hyperfinite type II1 factor and the hyperfinite type II∞ factor, found by . These are the unique hyperfinite factors of types II1 and II∞; there are an uncountable number of other factors of these types that are the subject of intensive study. proved the fundamental result that a factor of type II1 has a unique finite tracial state, and the set of traces of projections is [0,1].

A factor of type II∞ has a semifinite trace, unique up to rescaling, and the set of traces of projections is [0,∞]. The set of real numbers λ such that there is an automorphism rescaling the trace by a factor of λ is called the fundamental group of the type II∞ factor.

The tensor product of a factor of type II1 and an infinite type I factor has type II∞, and conversely any factor of type II∞ can be constructed like this. The fundamental group of a type II1 factor is defined to be the fundamental group of its tensor product with the infinite (separable) factor of type I. For many years it was an open problem to find a type II factor whose fundamental group was not the group of positive reals, but Connes then showed that the von Neumann group algebra of a countable discrete group with Kazhdan&#x27;s property (T) (the trivial representation is isolated in the dual space), such as SL(3,Z), has a countable fundamental group. Subsequently, Sorin Popa showed that the fundamental group can be trivial for certain groups, including the semidirect product of Z2 by SL(2,Z).

An example of a type II1 factor is the von Neumann group algebra of a countable infinite discrete group such that every non-trivial conjugacy class is infinite.
 found an uncountable family of such groups with non-isomorphic von Neumann group algebras, thus showing the existence of uncountably many different separable type II1 factors.

===Type III factors===
Lastly, type III factors are factors that do not contain any nonzero finite projections at all. In their first paper were unable to decide whether or not they existed; the first examples were later found by . Since the identity operator is always infinite in those factors, they were sometimes called type III∞ in the past, but recently that notation has been superseded by the notation IIIλ, where λ is a real number in the interval [0,1]. More precisely, if the Connes spectrum (of its modular group) is 1 then the factor is of type III0, if the Connes spectrum is all integral powers of λ for 0 &lt; λ &lt; 1, then the type is IIIλ, and if the Connes spectrum is all positive reals then the type is III1. (The Connes spectrum is a closed subgroup of the positive reals, so these are the only possibilities.) The only trace on type III factors takes value ∞ on all non-zero positive elements, and any two non-zero projections are equivalent. At one time type III factors were considered to be intractable objects, but Tomita–Takesaki theory has led to a good structure theory. In particular, any type III factor can be written in a canonical way as the crossed product of a type II∞ factor and the real numbers.

==The predual==
Any von Neumann algebra &quot;M&quot; has a predual &quot;M&quot;∗, which is the Banach space of all ultraweakly continuous linear functionals on &quot;M&quot;. As the name suggests, &quot;M&quot; is (as a Banach space) the dual of its predual. The predual is unique in the sense that any other Banach space whose dual is &quot;M&quot; is canonically isomorphic to &quot;M&quot;∗. showed that the existence of a predual characterizes von Neumann algebras among C* algebras.

The definition of the predual given above seems to depend on the choice of Hilbert space that &quot;M&quot; acts on, as this determines the ultraweak topology. However the predual can also be defined without using the Hilbert space that &quot;M&quot; acts on, by defining it to be the space generated by all positive normal linear functionals on &quot;M&quot;. (Here &quot;normal&quot; means that it preserves suprema when applied to increasing nets of self adjoint operators; or equivalently to increasing sequences of projections.)

The predual &quot;M&quot;∗ is a closed subspace of the dual &quot;M*&quot; (which consists of all norm-continuous linear functionals on &quot;M&quot;) but is generally smaller. The proof that &quot;M&quot;∗ is (usually) not the same as &quot;M*&quot; is nonconstructive and uses the axiom of choice in an essential way; it is very hard to exhibit explicit elements of &quot;M*&quot; that are not in &quot;M&quot;∗. For example, exotic positive linear forms on the von Neumann algebra &quot;l&quot;∞(&quot;Z&quot;) are given by free ultrafilters; they correspond to exotic *-homomorphisms into &quot;C&quot; and describe the Stone–Čech compactification of &quot;Z&quot;.

Examples:
#The predual of the von Neumann algebra &quot;L&quot;∞(R) of essentially bounded functions on R is the Banach space &quot;L&quot;1(R) of integrable functions. The dual of &quot;L&quot;∞(R) is strictly larger than &quot;L&quot;1(R) For example, a functional on &quot;L&quot;∞(R) that extends the Dirac measure δ0 on the closed subspace of bounded continuous functions &quot;C&quot;0b(R) cannot be represented as a function in &quot;L&quot;1(R).
#The predual of the von Neumann algebra &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) of bounded operators on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; is the Banach space of all trace class operators with the trace norm ||&quot;A&quot;||= Tr(|&quot;A&quot;|). The Banach space of trace class operators is itself the dual of the C*-algebra of compact operators (which is not a von Neumann algebra).

==Weights, states, and traces==
Weights and their special cases states and traces are discussed in detail in .

*A weight ω on a von Neumann algebra is a linear map from the set of positive elements (those of the form &quot;a*a&quot;) to [0,∞].
*A positive linear functional is a weight with ω(1) finite (or rather the extension of ω to the whole algebra by linearity).
*A state is a weight with ω(1) = 1.
*A trace is a weight with ω(&quot;aa*&quot;) = ω(&quot;a*a&quot;) for all &quot;a&quot;.
*A tracial state is a trace with ω(1) = 1.

Any factor has a trace such that the trace of a non-zero projection is non-zero and the trace of a projection is infinite if and only if the projection is infinite. Such a trace is unique up to rescaling. For factors that are separable or finite, two projections are equivalent if and only if they have the same trace. The type of a factor can be read off from the possible values of this trace over the projections of the factor, as follows:
*Type I&quot;n&quot;: 0, &quot;x&quot;, 2&quot;x&quot;, ...,&quot;nx&quot; for some positive &quot;x&quot; (usually normalized to be 1/&quot;n&quot; or 1).
*Type I∞: 0, &quot;x&quot;, 2&quot;x&quot;, ...,∞ for some positive &quot;x&quot; (usually normalized to be 1).
*Type II1: [0,&quot;x&quot;] for some positive &quot;x&quot; (usually normalized to be 1).
*Type II∞: [0,∞].
*Type III: {0,∞}.

If a von Neumann algebra acts on a Hilbert space containing a norm 1 vector &quot;v&quot;, then the functional &quot;a&quot; → (&quot;av&quot;,&quot;v&quot;) is a normal state. This construction can be reversed to give an action on a Hilbert space from a normal state: this is the GNS construction for normal states.

==Modules over a factor==
Given an abstract separable factor, one can ask for a classification of its modules, meaning the separable Hilbert spaces that it acts on. The answer is given as follows: every such module &quot;H&quot; can be given an &quot;M&quot;-dimension dim&quot;M&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) (not its dimension as a complex vector space) such that modules are isomorphic if and only if they have the same &quot;M&quot;-dimension. The &quot;M&quot;-dimension is additive, and a module is isomorphic to a subspace of another module if and only if it has smaller or equal &quot;M&quot;-dimension.

A module is called standard if it has a cyclic separating vector. Each factor has a standard representation, which is unique up to isomorphism. The standard representation has an antilinear involution &quot;J&quot; such that &quot;JMJ&quot; = &quot;&quot;. For finite factors the standard module is given by the GNS construction applied to the unique normal tracial state and the &quot;M&quot;-dimension is normalized so that the standard module has &quot;M&quot;-dimension 1, while for infinite factors the standard module is the module with &quot;M&quot;-dimension equal to ∞.

The possible &quot;M&quot;-dimensions of modules are given as follows:
*Type I&quot;n&quot; (&quot;n&quot; finite): The &quot;M&quot;-dimension can be any of 0/&quot;n&quot;, 1/&quot;n&quot;, 2/&quot;n&quot;, 3/&quot;n&quot;, ..., ∞. The standard module has &quot;M&quot;-dimension 1 (and complex dimension &quot;n&quot;2.)
*Type I∞ The &quot;M&quot;-dimension can be any of 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., ∞. The standard representation of &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) is &quot;H&quot;⊗&quot;H&quot;; its &quot;M&quot;-dimension is ∞.
*Type II1: The &quot;M&quot;-dimension can be anything in [0, ∞]. It is normalized so that the standard module has &quot;M&quot;-dimension 1. The &quot;M&quot;-dimension is also called the coupling constant of the module &quot;H&quot;.
*Type II∞: The &quot;M&quot;-dimension can be anything in [0, ∞]. There is in general no canonical way to normalize it; the factor may have outer automorphisms multiplying the &quot;M&quot;-dimension by constants. The standard representation is the one with &quot;M&quot;-dimension ∞.
*Type III: The &quot;M&quot;-dimension can be 0 or ∞. Any two non-zero modules are isomorphic, and all non-zero modules are standard.

==Amenable von Neumann algebras==
 and others proved that the following conditions on a von Neumann algebra &quot;M&quot; on a separable Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; are all equivalent:

* &quot;M&quot; is hyperfinite or AFD or approximately finite dimensional or approximately finite: this means the algebra contains an ascending sequence of finite dimensional subalgebras with dense union. (Warning: some authors use &quot;hyperfinite&quot; to mean &quot;AFD and finite&quot;.)
*&quot;M&quot; is amenable: this means that the derivations of &quot;M&quot; with values in a normal dual Banach bimodule are all inner.
*&quot;M&quot; has Schwartz&#x27;s property P: for any bounded operator &quot;T&quot; on &quot;H&quot; the weak operator closed convex hull of the elements &quot;uTu*&quot; contains an element commuting with &quot;M&quot;.
*&quot;M&quot; is semidiscrete: this means the identity map from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;M&quot; is a weak pointwise limit of completely positive maps of finite rank.
*&quot;M&quot; has property E or the Hakeda–Tomiyama extension property: this means that there is a projection of norm 1 from bounded operators on &quot;H&quot; to &quot;M&quot; &#x27;.
*&quot;M&quot; is injective: any completely positive linear map from any self adjoint closed subspace containing 1 of any unital C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; to &quot;M&quot; can be extended to a completely positive map from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;M&quot;.

There is no generally accepted term for the class of algebras above; Connes has suggested that amenable should be the standard term.

The amenable factors have been classified: there is a unique one of each of the types I&quot;n&quot;, I∞, II1, II∞, IIIλ, for 0 &lt; λ ≤ 1, and the ones of type III0 correspond to certain ergodic flows. (For type III0 calling this a classification is a little misleading, as it is known that there is no easy way to classify the corresponding ergodic flows.) The ones of type I and II1 were classified by , and the remaining ones were classified by , except for the type III1 case which was completed by Haagerup.

All amenable factors can be constructed using the group-measure space construction of Murray and von Neumann for a single ergodic transformation. In fact they are precisely the factors arising as crossed products by free ergodic actions of &quot;Z&quot; or &quot;Z/nZ&quot; on abelian von Neumann algebras &quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;X&quot;). Type I factors occur when the measure space &quot;X&quot; is atomic and the action transitive. When &quot;X&quot; is diffuse or non-atomic, it is equivalent to [0,1] as a measure space. Type II factors occur when &quot;X&quot; admits an equivalent finite (II1) or infinite (II∞) measure, invariant under an action of &quot;Z&quot;. Type III factors occur in the remaining cases where there is no invariant measure, but only an invariant measure class: these factors are called Krieger factors.

==Tensor products of von Neumann algebras==
The Hilbert space tensor product of two Hilbert spaces is the completion of their algebraic tensor product. One can define a tensor product of von Neumann algebras (a completion of the algebraic tensor product of the algebras considered as rings), which is again a von Neumann algebra, and act on the tensor product of the corresponding Hilbert spaces. The tensor product of two finite algebras is finite, and the tensor product of an infinite algebra and a non-zero algebra is infinite. The type of the tensor product of two von Neumann algebras (I, II, or III) is the maximum of their types. The commutation theorem for tensor products states that

:formula_7

where &quot;&quot; denotes the commutant of &quot;M&quot;.

The tensor product of an infinite number of von Neumann algebras, if done naively, is usually a ridiculously large non-separable algebra. Instead showed that one should choose a state on each of the von Neumann algebras, use this to define a state on the algebraic tensor product, which can be used to produce a Hilbert space and a (reasonably small) von Neumann algebra. studied the case where all the factors are finite matrix algebras; these factors are called Araki–Woods factors or ITPFI factors (ITPFI stands for &quot;infinite tensor product of finite type I factors&quot;). The type of the infinite tensor product can vary dramatically as the states are changed; for example, the infinite tensor product of an infinite number of type I2 factors can have any type depending on the choice of states. In particular found an uncountable family of non-isomorphic hyperfinite type IIIλ factors for 0 &lt; λ &lt; 1, called Powers factors, by taking an infinite tensor product of type I2 factors, each with the state given by:

All hyperfinite von Neumann algebras not of type III0 are isomorphic to Araki–Woods factors, but there are uncountably many of type III0 that are not.

==Bimodules and subfactors==
A bimodule (or correspondence) is a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; with module actions of two commuting von Neumann algebras. Bimodules have a much richer structure than that of modules. Any bimodule over two factors always gives a subfactor since one of the factors is always contained in the commutant of the other. There is also a subtle relative tensor product operation due to Connes on bimodules. The theory of subfactors, initiated by Vaughan Jones, reconciles these two seemingly different points of view.

Bimodules are also important for the von Neumann group algebra &quot;M&quot; of a discrete group Γ. Indeed, if &quot;V&quot; is any unitary representation of Γ, then, regarding Γ as the diagonal subgroup of Γ × Γ, the corresponding induced representation on &quot;l&quot;2 (Γ, &quot;V&quot;) is naturally a bimodule for two commuting copies of &quot;M&quot;. Important representation theoretic properties of Γ can be formulated entirely in terms of bimodules and therefore make sense for the von Neumann algebra itself. For example, Connes and Jones gave a definition of an analogue of Kazhdan&#x27;s property (T) for von Neumann algebras in this way.

==Non-amenable factors==
Von Neumann algebras of type I are always amenable, but for the other types there are an uncountable number of different non-amenable factors, which seem very hard to classify, or even distinguish from each other. Nevertheless, Voiculescu has shown that the class of non-amenable factors coming from the group-measure space construction is disjoint from the class coming from group von Neumann algebras of free groups. Later Narutaka Ozawa proved that group von Neumann algebras of hyperbolic groups yield prime type II1 factors, i.e. ones that cannot be factored as tensor products of type II1 factors, a result first proved by Leeming Ge for free group factors using Voiculescu&#x27;s free entropy. Popa&#x27;s work on fundamental groups of non-amenable factors represents another significant advance. The theory of factors &quot;beyond the hyperfinite&quot; is rapidly expanding at present, with many new and surprising results; it has close links with rigidity phenomena in geometric group theory and ergodic theory.

==Examples==
*The essentially bounded functions on a σ-finite measure space form a commutative (type I1) von Neumann algebra acting on the &quot;L&quot;2 functions. For certain non-σ-finite measure spaces, usually considered pathological, &quot;L&quot;∞(&quot;X&quot;) is not a von Neumann algebra; for example, the σ-algebra of measurable sets might be the countable-cocountable algebra on an uncountable set. A fundamental approximation theorem can be represented by the Kaplansky density theorem. 
*The bounded operators on any Hilbert space form a von Neumann algebra, indeed a factor, of type I.
*If we have any unitary representation of a group &quot;G&quot; on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; then the bounded operators commuting with &quot;G&quot; form a von Neumann algebra &#x27;, whose projections correspond exactly to the closed subspaces of &quot;H&quot; invariant under &quot;G&quot;. Equivalent subrepresentations correspond to equivalent projections in &#x27;. The double commutant &quot;&quot; of &quot;G&quot; is also a von Neumann algebra.
* The von Neumann group algebra of a discrete group &quot;G&quot; is the algebra of all bounded operators on &quot;H&quot; = &quot;l&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;) commuting with the action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;H&quot; through right multiplication. One can show that this is the von Neumann algebra generated by the operators corresponding to multiplication from the left with an element &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;. It is a factor (of type II1) if every non-trivial conjugacy class of &quot;G&quot; is infinite (for example, a non-abelian free group), and is the hyperfinite factor of type II1 if in addition &quot;G&quot; is a union of finite subgroups (for example, the group of all permutations of the integers fixing all but a finite number of elements).
*The tensor product of two von Neumann algebras, or of a countable number with states, is a von Neumann algebra as described in the section above.
*The crossed product of a von Neumann algebra by a discrete (or more generally locally compact) group can be defined, and is a von Neumann algebra. Special cases are the group-measure space construction of Murray and von Neumann and Krieger factors.
*The von Neumann algebras of a measurable equivalence relation and a measurable groupoid can be defined. These examples generalise von Neumann group algebras and the group-measure space construction.

==Applications==
Von Neumann algebras have found applications in diverse areas of mathematics like knot theory, statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, local quantum physics, free probability, noncommutative geometry, representation theory, differential geometry, and dynamical systems.

For instance, C*-algebra provides an alternative axiomatization to probability theory. In this case the method goes by the name of Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction. This is analogous to the two approaches to measure and integration, where one has the choice to construct measures of sets first and define integrals later, or construct integrals first and define set measures as integrals of characteristic functions.

<text>The Tâmega () or Támega (; ) is a river in Galicia, Spain and Portugal. It begins its course near Verín, Galicia, Spain, and flows to Portugal in the provinces of Trás-os-Montes and Douro Litoral.
The Tâmega River is a tributary of the Douro River. From Verín, it flows south to Portuguese city of Chaves; then it flows through a fertile valley called the Veiga. Below Chaves the river narrows to pass through mountains and valleys. Owing to low water level and frequent small dams it is not navigable, passing through the cities of Amarante and Marco de Canaveses, flowing in the Douro River, near Entre-os-Rios: in fact Entre-os-Rios means between the rivers.

The Tâmega is more important historically than economically. It has always served as an invasion route for foreign armies intent on reaching the richer southern lands of Portugal. The valley around Chaves has especially seen its share of battles and invading armies.

Like many rivers, the Tâmega suffers from pollution and the ravages of sand and gravel extraction companies. The quality of the water has deteriorated greatly. Another problem is the periodic occurrence of flooding.

Since the completion of the Torrão dam in 1988 less than 1 kilometre above the Douro river and the town of Entre-os-Rios in the municipality of Marco de Canaveses, the Tâmega has been recovering slowly from the effects of pollution. Sand extraction activities have been prohibited and many upstream cities installed modern sewage treatment plants. 

A new dam is planned between the city of Amarante and the town of Mondim de Basto. Besides producing electricity, the project will feature a flood control system that will divert the waterflow towards the smaller Olo River. A 220 MW pumped-storage hydroelectricity facility started operating in 2022, storing 40 GWh of electricity. It cost €1.5 billion. Three more turbines are scheduled for the site, bringing the storage power to 880 MW. The project also includes two run-of-the-river hydroelectricity facilities.

==Transport==
The Tâmega line, which closed in 2009, was a narrow gauge railway line which closely followed the river.

<doc id="294195" wikidata="Q3483986" url="?curid=294195" title="Harold Bennett">
<text>Harold Frank Bennett (17 November 1898 – 11 September 1981) was an English actor, active in stage, television and film best remembered for being in sitcoms written and produced by David Croft, having played &#x27;Young Mr. Grace&#x27; in the 1970s British sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, as well as minor character Sidney Bluett in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army.&quot;

==Biography==
Bennett was born in Hastings, Sussex. After leaving school at the age of twelve, in his early life he toured America as a clown with a circus, and later taught English at the Working Men&#x27;s College in London. During World War I he served as a courier, initially on horseback, then on motorcycle. After the war he took up acting and eventually worked as stage producer in the Tower Theatre, London. He subsequently pursued a career as a draughtsman for an electric company, only taking up his acting career again following retirement.

Harold Bennett died of a heart attack on 11 September 1981, aged 82. His wife predeceased him in the 1930s; he was survived by their three children. One of his children, John, was also an actor.

==Acting career==
He played the recurring character Mr (Sidney) Bluett in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; from 1969 to 1977, but it was as Young Mr Grace, the ancient, amiably callous owner of Grace Brothers department store in British sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; that he achieved his greatest fame. His last appearance in &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; aired some three months after his death, having been recorded earlier in the year.

Bennett also played the role of the aged Archdeacon Pulteney in &quot;The Stalls of Barchester&quot;, the BBC &quot;A Ghost Story for Christmas&quot; broadcast 24 December 1971 and adapted from the M.R. James story of the same name. Bennett also appeared in &quot;Vote, Vote, Vote for Nigel Barton&quot; (1965), and in several films, including as a photographer in &quot;Games That Lovers Play&quot; (1971) and as the aged odd-job man Gasper in &quot;The Ups and Downs of a Handyman&quot; (1975).

On the stage, he appeared in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;London Assurance&quot;, and in an Open University production of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;.

<text>A globe is a spherical model of Earth, of some other celestial body, or of the celestial sphere. Globes serve purposes similar to maps, but, unlike maps, they do not distort the surface that they portray except to scale it down. A model globe of Earth is called a terrestrial globe. A model globe of the celestial sphere is called a &quot;celestial globe&quot;.

A globe shows details of its subject. A terrestrial globe shows landmasses and water bodies. It might show nations and major cities and the network of latitude and longitude lines. Some have raised relief to show mountains and other large landforms. A celestial globe shows notable stars, and may also show positions of other prominent astronomical objects. Typically, it will also divide the celestial sphere into constellations.

The word &quot;globe&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;globus&quot;, meaning &quot;sphere&quot;. Globes have a long history. The first known mention of a globe is from Strabo, describing the Globe of Crates from about 150 BC. The oldest surviving terrestrial globe is the Erdapfel, made by Martin Behaim in 1492. The oldest surviving celestial globe sits atop the Farnese Atlas, carved in the 2nd century Roman Empire.

==Terrestrial and planetary==
 Flat maps are created using a map projection that inevitably introduces an increasing amount of distortion the larger the area that the map shows. A globe is the only representation of the Earth that does not distort either the shape or the size of large features – land masses, bodies of water, etc.

The Earth&#x27;s circumference is quite close to 40 million metres. Many globes are made with a circumference of one metre, so they are models of the Earth at a scale of 1:40 million. In imperial units, many globes are made with a diameter of one foot (about 30 cm), yielding a circumference of 3.14 feet (about 96 cm) and a scale of 1:42 million. Globes are also made in many other sizes.

Some globes have surface texture showing topography or bathymetry. In these, elevations and depressions are purposely exaggerated, as they otherwise would be hardly visible. For example, one manufacturer produces a three dimensional raised relief globe with a diameter (equivalent to a 200 cm circumference, or approximately a scale of 1:20 million) showing the highest mountains as over tall, which is about 57 times higher than the correct scale of Mount Everest.

Most modern globes are also imprinted with parallels and meridians, so that one can tell the approximate coordinates of a specific location. Globes may also show the boundaries of countries and their names.

Many terrestrial globes have one celestial feature marked on them: a diagram called the analemma, which shows the apparent motion of the Sun in the sky during a year.

Globes generally show north at the top, but many globes allow the axis to be swiveled so that southern portions can be viewed conveniently. This capability also permits exploring the Earth from different orientations to help counter the north-up bias caused by conventional map presentation.

==Celestial==
Celestial globes show the apparent positions of the stars in the sky. They omit the Sun, Moon and planets because the positions of these bodies vary relative to those of the stars, but the ecliptic, along which the Sun moves, is indicated. In their most basic form celestial globes represent the stars as if the viewer were looking down upon the sky as a globe that surrounds the earth.

==History==
The sphericity of the Earth was established by Greek astronomy in the 3rd century BC, and the earliest terrestrial globe appeared from that period. The earliest known example is the one constructed by Crates of Mallus in Cilicia (now Çukurova in modern-day Turkey), in the mid-2nd century BC.

No terrestrial globes from Antiquity have survived. An example of a surviving celestial globe is part of a Hellenistic sculpture, called the Farnese Atlas, surviving in a 2nd-century AD Roman copy in the Naples Archaeological Museum, Italy.

Early terrestrial globes depicting the entirety of the Old World were constructed in the Islamic world. During the Middle Ages in Christian Europe, while there are writings alluding to the idea that the earth was spherical, no known attempts at making a globe took place before the fifteenth century. The earliest extant terrestrial globe was made in 1492 by Martin Behaim (1459–1537) with help from the painter Georg Glockendon. Behaim was a German mapmaker, navigator, and merchant. Working in Nuremberg, Germany, he called his globe the &quot;Nürnberg Terrestrial Globe.&quot; It is now known as the Erdapfel. Before constructing the globe, Behaim had traveled extensively. He sojourned in Lisbon from 1480, developing commercial interests and mingling with explorers and scientists. He began to construct his globe after his return to Nürnberg in 1490.

China made many mapping advancements such as sophisticated land surveys and the invention of the magnetic compass. However, no record of terrestrial globes in China exists until a globe was introduced by the Persian astronomer, Jamal ad-Din, in 1276.

Another early globe, the Hunt–Lenox Globe, ca. 1510, is thought to be the source of the phrase &quot;Hic Sunt Dracones&quot;, or &quot;Here be dragons&quot;. A similar grapefruit-sized globe made from two halves of an ostrich egg was found in 2012 and is believed to date from 1504. It may be the oldest globe to show the New World. Stefaan Missine, who analyzed the globe for the Washington Map Society journal &quot;Portolan&quot;, said it was &quot;part of an important European collection for decades.&quot; After a year of research in which he consulted many experts, Missine concluded the Hunt–Lenox Globe was a copper cast of the egg globe.

A facsimile globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemüller in 1507. Another &quot;remarkably modern-looking&quot; terrestrial globe of the Earth was constructed by Taqi al-Din at the Constantinople observatory of Taqi ad-Din during the 1570s.

The world&#x27;s first seamless celestial globe was built by Mughal scientists under the patronage of Jahangir.

&quot;Globus&quot; IMP, electro-mechanical devices including five-inch globes have been used in Soviet and Russian spacecraft from 1961 to 2002 as navigation instruments. In 2001, the TMA version of the Soyuz spacecraft replaced this instrument with a digital map.
==Manufacture==
Traditionally, globes were manufactured by gluing a printed paper map onto a sphere, often made from wood.

The most common type has long, thin gores (strips) of paper that narrow to a point at the poles, small disks cover over the inevitable irregularities at these points. The more gores there are, the less stretching and crumpling is required to make the paper map fit the sphere. This method of globe making was illustrated in 1802 in an engraving in The English Encyclopedia by George Kearsley. 

Modern globes are often made from thermoplastic. Flat, plastic disks are printed with a distorted map of one of the Earth&#x27;s hemispheres. This is placed in a machine which molds the disk into a hemispherical shape. The hemisphere is united with its opposite counterpart to form a complete globe.

Usually a globe is mounted so that its rotation axis is 23.5° (0.41 rad) from vertical, which is the angle the Earth&#x27;s rotation axis deviates from perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. This mounting makes it easy to visualize how seasons change.

In the 1800s small pocket globes (less than 3 inches) were status symbols for gentlemen and educational toys for rich children.
== Examples==

Sorted in decreasing sizes:

* The Unisphere in Flushing Meadows, New York, at the Billie Jean King USTA Tennis Center, at in diameter, is the world&#x27;s largest geographical globe. This corresponds to a scale of about 1:350 000. (There are larger spherical structures, such as the Cinesphere in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but this does not have geographical or astronomical markings.)
* Wyld&#x27;s Great Globe, located in London&#x27;s Leicester Square from 1851-1862, was a hollow globe 60 feet 4 inches (18.39 m) in diameter designed by mapmaker James Wyld. Visitors could climb stairs to view a plaster of Paris model of the Earth&#x27;s surface, complete with mountains and rivers to scale.
* Eartha, the world&#x27;s largest rotating globe with a diameter of , located at the DeLorme headquarters in Yarmouth, Maine. This corresponds to a scale of about 1:1.1 million. Eartha was constructed in 1998.
* The P-I Globe, a 13.5-ton  30-foot (9.1 m) neon globe with rotating &quot;It&#x27;s in the P-I&quot; words and an 18-foot eagle, was made in 1948 for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer&#x27;s headquarters. It was moved to the newspaper&#x27;s new location in 1986.
* The Great Globe at Swanage is a stone sphere that stands at Durlston Castle within Durlston Country Park, England. Measuring 10 feet (3.0 m) in diameter and weighing 40 tons, this intricately carved globe showcases the continents, oceans, and specific regions of the world. Crafted from Portland stone, it spans about 3 meters (10 ft) in diameter.

<doc id="294216" wikidata="Q175096" url="?curid=294216" title="SWOT analysis">
<text>In strategic planning and strategic management, SWOT analysis (also known as the SWOT matrix, TOWS, WOTS, , and situational analysis) is a decision-making technique that identifies the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of an organization or project.

SWOT analysis evaluates the strategic position of organizations and is often used in the preliminary stages of decision-making processes to identify internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving goals. Users of a SWOT analysis ask questions to generate answers for each category and identify competitive advantages.

SWOT has been described as a &quot;tried-and-true&quot; tool of strategic analysis, but has also been criticized for limitations such as the static nature of the analysis, the influence of personal biases in identifying key factors, and the overemphasis on external factors, leading to reactive strategies. Consequently, alternative approaches to SWOT have been developed over the years.

== Overview ==
The name is an acronym for four components:

* : characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others
* : characteristics that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others
* : elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage
* : elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project

Results of the assessment are often presented in the form of a matrix.

=== Internal and external factors ===
Strengths and weaknesses are usually considered internal, while opportunities and threats are usually considered external. The degree to which an organization&#x27;s internal strengths matches with its external opportunities is known as its strategic fit.

Internal factors may include:
* Human resources—staff, volunteers, board members, stakeholders
* Physical resources—location, building, equipment, plant
* Financial—revenue, grants, investments, other sources of income
* Activities and processes—projects, programs, systems
* Past experiences—reputation, knowledge

External factors may include:
* Future trends in the organization&#x27;s field or society at large (e.g. macroeconomics, technological change)
* The economy—local, national, or international
* Funding sources—investors, foundations, donors, legislatures
* Demographics—changes in the age, race, gender, culture of those in the organization serviceable area
* Physical environment—growth of location in which organisation is situated, access to location
* Legislation
* Local, national, or international events

A number of authors advocate assessing external factors before internal factors.

== Use ==
SWOT analysis has been used at different levels of analysis, including businesses, non-profit organizations, governmental units, and individuals. It is often used alongside other frameworks, such as PEST, as a basis for the analysis of internal and environmental factors. SWOT analysis may also be used in pre-crisis planning, preventive crisis management, and viability study recommendation construction.

=== Strategic planning ===
SWOT analysis can be used to build organizational or personal strategy. Steps necessary to execute strategy-oriented analysis involve identifying internal and external factors, selecting and evaluating the most important factors, and identifying relationships between internal and external features. For instance, strong relations between strengths and opportunities can suggest good conditions in the company and allow using an strategy. On the other hand, strong interactions between weaknesses and threats could be analyzed as a warning to use a strategy.

One form of SWOT analysis combines each of the four components with another to examine four distinct strategies:
* WT strategy (mini–mini): Faced with external threats and internal weaknesses, how to minimize both weaknesses and threats?
* WO strategy (mini–maxi): Faced with external opportunities and internal weaknesses, how to minimize weaknesses and maximize opportunities?
* ST strategy (maxi–mini): Faced with internal strengths and external threats, how to maximize strengths and minimize threats?
* SO strategy (maxi–maxi): Faced with external opportunities and internal strengths, how to maximize both opportunities and strengths?

==== Matching and converting ====
A SWOT analysis can be used to generate matching and converting strategies. Matching refers to seeking competitive advantage by matching strengths to opportunities. This strategy ensures that an organization leverages its core competencies, resources, and capabilities to capitalize on favorable market conditions, emerging trends, or unmet customer needs. Conversion refers to converting weaknesses or threats into strengths or opportunities. An example of a conversion strategy is to buy off a threat through collaboration or merger.

=== Marketing ===
In competitor analysis, marketers can use SWOT analysis to detail and profile the competitive strengths and weaknesses of each competitor in the market. This process may involve analysing competitors&#x27; cost structures, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive positioning, product differentiation, degree of vertical integration, historical responses to industry developments, among other factors. Relevant marketing research methods may include:
* Qualitative marketing research such as focus groups
* Quantitative marketing research such as statistical surveys
* Experimental techniques such as test markets
* Observational techniques such as ethnographic (on-site) observation

Marketing managers may also design and oversee various environmental scanning and competitive intelligence processes to help identify trends and inform the company&#x27;s marketing analysis.

=== In community organizations ===
Although the SWOT analysis was originally designed for business and industries, it has been used in non-governmental organisations as a tool for identifying external and internal support to combat internal and external opposition for successful implementation of social services and social change efforts. Understanding particular communities can come from public forums, listening campaigns, and informational interviews and other data collection. SWOT analysis provides direction to the next stages of the change process. It has been used by community organizers and community members to further social justice in the context of social work practice, and can be applied directly to communities served by a specific nonprofit or community organization.

==Limitations and alternatives==
SWOT analysis is intended as a starting point for discussion and not to, in itself, show managers how to achieve a competitive advantage.

In a highly-cited 1997 critique, &quot;SWOT Analysis: It&#x27;s Time for a Product Recall&quot;, Terry Hill and Roy Westbrook observed that one among many problems of SWOT analysis as often practiced is that &quot;no-one subsequently used the outputs [of SWOT analysis] within the later stages of the strategy&quot;. Hill and Westbrook, among others, also criticized hastily designed SWOT lists. Other limitations of SWOT practice include: preoccupation with a single strength, such as cost control, leading to a neglect of weaknesses, such as product quality; and domination by one or two team members doing the SWOT analysis and devaluing possibly important contributions of other team members. Many other limitations have been identified.

Business professors have suggested various ways to remedy the common problems and limitations of SWOT analysis while retaining the SWOT framework.

=== Porter&#x27;s five forces ===
Michael Porter developed the five forces framework as an alternative to SWOT analyses, which he found lacking in rigor and over-dependent on individual company circumstances.

=== SOAR ===
SOAR (strengths, opportunities, aspirations, and results) is an alternative technique inspired by appreciative inquiry. SOAR has been criticized as having similar limitations as SWOT, such as &quot;the inability to identify the necessary data&quot;.

=== SVOR ===
In project management, the alternative to SWOT known by the acronym SVOR (Strengths, Vulnerabilities, Opportunities, and Risks) compares the project elements along two axes: internal and external, and positive and negative. It takes into account the mathematical link that exists between these various elements, considering also the role of infrastructures. The SVOR table provides an intricate understanding of the elements hypothesized to be at play in a given project:

Constraints consist of: calendar of tasks and activities, costs, and norms of quality. The &quot;k&quot; constant varies with each project (for example, it may be valued at 1.3).

== History ==
In 1965, three colleagues at the Long Range Planning Service of Stanford Research Institute—Robert F. Stewart, Otis J. Benepe, and Arnold Mitchell—wrote a technical report titled &quot;Formal Planning: The Staff Planner&#x27;s Role at Start-Up&quot;. The report described how a person in the role of a company&#x27;s staff planner would gather information from managers assessing operational issues grouped into four components represented by the acronym SOFT: the &quot;satisfactory&quot; in present operations, &quot;opportunities&quot; in future operations, &quot;faults&quot; in present operations, and &quot;threats&quot; to future operations. Stewart et al. focused on internal operational assessment and divided the four components into (satisfactory and fault) and (opportunity and threat), and not, as would later become common in SWOT analysis, into (strengths and weaknesses) and (opportunities and threats).

Also in 1965, four colleagues at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration—Edmund P. Learned, C. Roland Christensen, Kenneth R. Andrews, and William D. Guth—published the first of many editions of the textbook &quot;Business Policy: Text and Cases&quot;. ( was a term then current for what has come to be called strategic management.) The first chapter of the textbook stated, without using the acronym, the four components of SWOT and their division into internal and external appraisal:

Looking back from three decades later, in the book &quot;Strategy Safari&quot; (1998), management scholar Henry Mintzberg and colleagues said that &quot;Business Policy: Text and Cases&quot; &quot;quickly became the most popular classroom book in the field&quot;, widely diffusing its authors&#x27; ideas, which Mintzberg et al. called the &quot;design school&quot; model (in contrast to nine other schools that they identified) of strategic management, &quot;with its famous notion of SWOT&quot; emphasizing assessment of a company&#x27;s internal and external situations. However, the textbook contains neither a 2 × 2 SWOT matrix nor any detailed procedure for doing a SWOT assessment. &quot;Strategy Safari&quot; and other books identified Kenneth R. Andrews as the co-author of &quot;Business Policy: Text and Cases&quot; who was responsible for writing the theoretical part of the book containing the SWOT components. More generally, Mintzberg et al. attributed some conceptual influences on what they called the &quot;design school&quot; (of which they were strongly critical) to earlier books by Philip Selznick (&quot;Leadership in Administration&quot;, 1957) and Alfred D. Chandler Jr. (&quot;Strategy and Structure&quot;, 1962), with other possible influences going back to the McKinsey consulting firm in the 1930s.

By the end of the 1960s, the four components of SWOT (without using the acronym) had appeared in other publications on strategic planning by various authors, and by 1972 the acronym had appeared in the title of a journal article by Norman Stait, a management consultant at the British firm Urwick, Orr and Partners. By 1973, the acronym was well-known enough that accountant William W. Fea, in a published lecture, mentioned &quot;the mnemonic, familiar to students, of S.W.O.T., namely strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats&quot;. An early example of a 2 × 2 SWOT matrix is found in a 1980 article by management professor Igor Ansoff (but Ansoff used the acronym T/O/S/W instead of SWOT).

==In popular culture==
* Television: In the 2015 &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; episode &quot;Homicide&quot; (Season 2, Episode 6), Jared Dunn (Zach Woods) introduces the Pied Piper team to SWOT analysis. Later in that episode Dinesh (Kumail Nanjiani) and Gilfoyle (Martin Starr) employ the method when deciding whether or not to inform a stunt driver that the calculations for his upcoming jump were performed incorrectly.

<doc id="294218" wikidata="Q740612" url="?curid=294218" title="Molecular assembler">
<text>A molecular assembler, as defined by K. Eric Drexler, is a &quot;proposed device able to guide chemical reactions by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision&quot;. A molecular assembler is a kind of molecular machine. Some biological molecules such as ribosomes fit this definition. This is because they receive instructions from messenger RNA and then assemble specific sequences of amino acids to construct protein molecules. However, the term &quot;molecular assembler&quot; usually refers to theoretical human-made devices.

Beginning in 2007, the British Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council has funded development of ribosome-like molecular assemblers. Clearly, molecular assemblers are possible in this limited sense. A technology roadmap project, led by the Battelle Memorial Institute and hosted by several U.S. National Laboratories has explored a range of atomically precise fabrication technologies, including both early-generation and longer-term prospects for programmable molecular assembly; the report was released in December, 2007. In 2008, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council provided funding of £1.5 million over six years (£1,942,235.57, $2,693,808.00 in 2021) for research working towards mechanized mechanosynthesis, in partnership with the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, amongst others.

Likewise, the term &quot;molecular assembler&quot; has been used in science fiction and popular culture to refer to a wide range of fantastic atom-manipulating nanomachines. Much of the controversy regarding &quot;molecular assemblers&quot; results from the confusion in the use of the name for both technical concepts and popular fantasies. In 1992, Drexler introduced the related but better-understood term &quot;molecular manufacturing&quot;, which he defined as the programmed &quot;chemical synthesis of complex structures by mechanically positioning reactive molecules, not by manipulating individual atoms&quot;.

This article mostly discusses &quot;molecular assemblers&quot; in the popular sense. These include hypothetical machines that manipulate individual atoms and machines with organism-like self-replicating abilities, mobility, ability to consume food, and so forth. These are quite different from devices that merely (as defined above) &quot;guide chemical reactions by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision&quot;.

Because synthetic molecular assemblers have never been constructed and because of the confusion regarding the meaning of the term, there has been much controversy as to whether &quot;molecular assemblers&quot; are possible or simply science fiction. Confusion and controversy also stem from their classification as nanotechnology, which is an active area of laboratory research which has already been applied to the production of real products; however, there had been, until recently, no research efforts into the actual construction of &quot;molecular assemblers&quot;.

Nonetheless, a 2013 paper by David Leigh&#x27;s group, published in the journal &quot;Science&quot;, details a new method of synthesizing a peptide in a sequence-specific manner by using an artificial molecular machine that is guided by a molecular strand. This functions in the same way as a ribosome building proteins by assembling amino acids according to a messenger RNA blueprint. The structure of the machine is based on a rotaxane, which is a molecular ring sliding along a molecular axle. The ring carries a thiolate group, which removes amino acids in sequence from the axle, transferring them to a peptide assembly site. In 2018, the same group published a more advanced version of this concept in which the molecular ring shuttles along a polymeric track to assemble an oligopeptide that can fold into an α-helix that can perform the enantioselective epoxidation of a chalcone derivative (in a way reminiscent to the ribosome assembling an enzyme). In another paper published in &quot;Science&quot; in March 2015, chemists at the University of Illinois report a platform that automates the synthesis of 14 classes of small molecules, with thousands of compatible building blocks.

In 2017, David Leigh&#x27;s group reported a molecular robot that could be programmed to construct any one of four different stereoisomers of a molecular product by using a nanomechanical robotic arm to move a molecular substrate between different reactive sites of an artificial molecular machine. An accompanying News and Views article, titled &#x27;A molecular assembler&#x27;, outlined the operation of the molecular robot as effectively a prototypical molecular assembler.

==Nanofactories==
A nanofactory is a proposed system in which nanomachines (resembling molecular assemblers, or industrial robot arms) would combine reactive molecules via mechanosynthesis to build larger atomically precise parts. These, in turn, would be assembled by positioning mechanisms of assorted sizes to build macroscopic (visible) but still atomically-precise products.

A typical nanofactory would fit in a desktop box, in the vision of K. Eric Drexler published in &quot;Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation&quot; (1992), a notable work of &quot;exploratory engineering&quot;. During the 1990s, others have extended the nanofactory concept, including an analysis of nanofactory convergent assembly by Ralph Merkle, a systems design of a replicating nanofactory architecture by J. Storrs Hall, Forrest Bishop&#x27;s &quot;Universal Assembler&quot;, the patented exponential assembly process by Zyvex, and a top-level systems design for a &#x27;primitive nanofactory&#x27; by Chris Phoenix (director of research at the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology). All of these nanofactory designs (and more) are summarized in Chapter 4 of &quot;Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines&quot; (2004) by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle. The Nanofactory Collaboration, founded by Freitas and Merkle in 2000, is a focused, ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda specifically aimed at positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development.

In 2005, an animated short film of the nanofactory concept was produced by John Burch, in collaboration with Drexler. Such visions have been the subject of much debate, on several intellectual levels. No one has discovered an insurmountable problem with the underlying theories and no one has proved that the theories can be translated into practice. However, the debate continues, with some of it being summarized in the molecular nanotechnology article.

If nanofactories could be built, severe disruption to the world economy would be one of many possible negative impacts, though it could be argued that this disruption would have little negative effect, if everyone had such nanofactories. Great benefits also would be anticipated. Various works of science fiction have explored these and similar concepts. The potential for such devices was part of the mandate of a major UK study led by mechanical engineering professor Dame Ann Dowling.

==Self-replication==
&quot;Molecular assemblers&quot; have been confused with self-replicating machines. To produce a practical quantity of a desired product, the nanoscale size of a typical science fiction universal molecular assembler requires an extremely large number of such devices. However, a single such theoretical molecular assembler might be programmed to self-replicate, constructing many copies of itself. This would allow an exponential rate of production. Then, after sufficient quantities of the molecular assemblers were available, they would then be re-programmed for production of the desired product. However, if self-replication of molecular assemblers were not restrained then it might lead to competition with naturally occurring organisms. This has been called ecophagy or the grey goo problem.

One method of building molecular assemblers is to mimic evolutionary processes employed by biological systems. Biological evolution proceeds by random variation combined with culling of the less-successful variants and reproduction of the more-successful variants. Production of complex molecular assemblers might be evolved from simpler systems since &quot;A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. . . . A complex system designed from scratch never works and can not be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a system that works.&quot; However, most published safety guidelines include &quot;recommendations against developing ... replicator designs which permit surviving mutation or undergoing evolution&quot;.

Most assembler designs keep the &quot;source code&quot; external to the physical assembler. At each step of a manufacturing process, that step is read from an ordinary computer file and &quot;broadcast&quot; to all the assemblers. If any assembler gets out of range of that computer, or when the link between that computer and the assemblers is broken, or when that computer is unplugged, the assemblers stop replicating. Such a &quot;broadcast architecture&quot; is one of the safety features recommended by the &quot;Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology&quot;, and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous practical methods by which replicators can be safely controlled by good design.

==Drexler and Smalley debate==
One of the most outspoken critics of some concepts of &quot;molecular assemblers&quot; was Professor Richard Smalley (1943–2005) who won the Nobel prize for his contributions to the field of nanotechnology. Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them. His two principal technical objections were termed the &quot;fat fingers problem&quot; and the &quot;sticky fingers problem&quot;. He believed these would exclude the possibility of &quot;molecular assemblers&quot; that worked by precision picking and placing of individual atoms. Drexler and coworkers responded to these two issues in a 2001 publication.

Smalley also believed that Drexler&#x27;s speculations about apocalyptic dangers of self-replicating machines that have been equated with &quot;molecular assemblers&quot; would threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology. To address the debate between Drexler and Smalley regarding molecular assemblers &quot;Chemical &amp; Engineering News&quot; published a point-counterpoint consisting of an exchange of letters that addressed the issues.

==Regulation==
Speculation on the power of systems that have been called &quot;molecular assemblers&quot; has sparked a wider political discussion on the implication of nanotechnology. This is in part due to the fact that nanotechnology is a very broad term and could include &quot;molecular assemblers&quot;. Discussion of the possible implications of fantastic molecular assemblers has prompted calls for regulation of current and future nanotechnology. There are very real concerns with the potential health and ecological impact of nanotechnology that is being integrated in manufactured products. Greenpeace for instance commissioned a report concerning nanotechnology in which they express concern into the toxicity of nanomaterials that have been introduced in the environment. However, it makes only passing references to &quot;assembler&quot; technology. The UK Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering also commissioned a report entitled &quot;Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties&quot; regarding the larger social and ecological implications of nanotechnology. This report does not discuss the threat posed by potential so-called &quot;molecular assemblers&quot;.

==Formal scientific review==
In 2006, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences released the report of a study of molecular manufacturing (not molecular assemblers per se) as part of a longer report, &quot;A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative&quot; The study committee reviewed the technical content of &quot;Nanosystems&quot;, and in its conclusion states that no current theoretical analysis can be considered definitive regarding several questions of potential system performance, and that optimal paths for implementing high-performance systems cannot be predicted with confidence. It recommends funding for experimental research to produce experimental demonstrations in this area:

&quot;Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable range of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and thermodynamic efficiencies of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of manufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted with confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems which greatly exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies and other capabilities of biological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that is based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to achieve this goal.&quot;

==Gray goo==
One potential scenario that has been envisioned is out-of-control self-replicating molecular assemblers in the form of gray goo which consumes carbon to continue its replication. If unchecked, such mechanical replication could potentially consume whole ecoregions or the whole Earth (ecophagy), or it could simply outcompete natural lifeforms for necessary resources such as carbon, ATP, or UV light (which some nanomotor examples run on). However, the ecophagy and &#x27;grey goo&#x27; scenarios, like synthetic molecular assemblers, are based upon still-hypothetical technologies that have not yet been demonstrated experimentally.

<text>Andreas Schroeder (b. , West Germany 26 November 1946) is a German-born Canadian poet, novelist, and nonfiction writer who lives in the small town of Roberts Creek, British Columbia.

== Career ==
Schroeder is the author of some 23 books, including fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry, translations and criticism. For many years he appeared on the CBC radio show &quot;Basic Black&quot; as its &quot;resident crookologist&quot;, presenting a segment on some of the world&#x27;s most outrageous and humorous crimes and criminals.

He served a term as Chair of the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada (1976/77), at which time he took over the Union&#x27;s crusade for Public Lending Right. When that program was finally achieved, in 1986, he became its founding chair, and served as the Union&#x27;s PLR representative on the Public Lending Right Commission until 2008.

Schroeder teaches Creative Non-Fiction in the University of British Columbia&#x27;s Creative Writing program, where he holds the Rogers Communications Chair in Creative Nonfiction.

Schroeder has been shortlisted for a Governor-General&#x27;s Award (Nonfiction: &quot;Shaking It Rough&quot;) in 1977, the Sealbooks First Novel Award (1984), an Arthur Ellis Award for Best Nonfiction (1997), The Stephen Leacock Award for Humor (1997) and the Malahat Review Novella competition (1998). He has won the OLA&#x27;s Red Maple Award for Young Adult Nonfiction twice (2005; 2007), has received several National Magazine Awards, and won the Canadian Association of Journalists&#x27; &quot;Best Investigative Journalism&quot; award in 1990. He is a member of the New Democratic Party and describes himself as a &quot;non-observant Mennonite&quot;.

He is married to Sharon Brown; the couple have two daughters.

<doc id="294223" wikidata="Q370282" url="?curid=294223" title="Shyam Selvadurai">
<text>Shyam Selvadurai (born 12 February 1965) is a Sri Lankan Canadian novelist. He is most noted for his 1994 novel &quot;Funny Boy&quot;, which won the Books in Canada First Novel Award and the Lambda Literary Award for Gay Fiction.

==Background==
Selvadurai was born in Colombo, Sri Lanka to a Sinhalese mother and a Tamil father—members of conflicting ethnic groups whose troubles form a major theme in his work. Ethnic riots in 1983 drove the family to emigrate to Canada when Selvadurai was nineteen. He attained a BFA at York University for Theatre in 1989, then achieved an MFA in Creative Writing at the University of British Columbia in 2010. Selvadurai recounted an account of the discomfort he and his partner experienced during a period spent in Sri Lanka in 1997 in his essay &quot;Coming Out&quot; in &quot;Time&quot; Asia&#x27;s special issue on the Asian diaspora in 2003.

==Writing career==
Selvadurai published &quot;Funny Boy&quot; in 1994, and followed up in 1998 with the novel &quot;Cinnamon Gardens&quot;.

In 2004, Selvadurai edited a collection of short stories: &quot;Story-Wallah: Short Fiction from South Asian Writers&quot;, which includes works by Salman Rushdie, Monica Ali, and Hanif Kureishi, among others. He published a young adult novel, &quot;Swimming in the Monsoon Sea&quot;, in 2005. &quot;Swimming&quot; won the Lambda Literary Award in the Children&#x27;s and Youth Literature category in 2006. He was a contributor to &quot;TOK: Writing the New Toronto, Book 1&quot;.

In 2013, he released a fourth novel, &quot;The Hungry Ghosts&quot;. In 2013 Selvadurai&#x27;s &quot;Funny Boy&quot; was included in the syllabus under marginalized study and gay literature of the under graduate English Department of The American College in Madurai. In 2014, he was presented the Bonham Centre Award from The Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies, University of Toronto, for his contributions to the advancement and education of issues around sexual identification.

In 2020, Deepa Mehta released the film &quot;Funny Boy&quot;, an adaptation of Selvadurai&#x27;s novel. At the 9th Canadian Screen Awards in 2021, Mehta and Selvadurai won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

In 2022, he released &quot; Mansions of the Moon&quot;, a historical novel about the Buddha’s wife, Yasodhara.

==Personal life==
He currently lives in Toronto with his partner Andrew Champion.

In 2016, a species of spider was named after Selvadurai called &quot;Brignolia Shyami&quot;, a small goblin spider which is a pale yellow colour and between 1.4mm and 1.5mm in length.

<text>Mr. Personality is an American reality television series broadcast by the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). The five-episode series premiered on April 21, 2003 and concluded on May 19, 2003. Filmed in Malibu, California, the series followed Hayley Arp, a 26-year-old stockbroker, as she selected a suitor among a group of twenty men. In an effort for Arp to select her suitor solely based on personality, all of the men were required to wear color-coded latex masks throughout the competition. Arp eliminated a predetermined amount of suitors each week until only one remained; upon selection of a final suitor, Arp was allowed to remove his mask and see his appearance. The series was hosted by American media personality Monica Lewinsky.

&quot;Mr. Personality&quot; was a part of Fox&#x27;s intent to capitalize on the burgeoning success of the reality television genre. The series received unfavorable reviews from television critics, who derided the series&#x27; concept and the network&#x27;s choice of casting Lewinsky as the host. The series premiered with strong ratings, however, they waned over the course of the season; the two-hour finale was condensed into a one-hour episode as a result of the series&#x27; subpar ratings. Since the series&#x27; end, several producers and contestants have voiced their regret over &quot;Mr. Personality&quot;.

==Format==

Set on an estate in Malibu, California, the series depicted a competition among a group of 20 men who attempted to court Hayley Arp, a 26-year-old stockbroker from Georgia. Through a series of dates and social interactions, Arp was required to select a suitor among the group of men solely on the basis of their personality. In order to conceal their appearance, the men were required to wear color-coded latex masks, in which only their eyes and mouths remained visible. The men additionally were prohibited from discussing their job titles or financial status. Arp had the opportunity to get a feel for the men&#x27;s appearances during one-on-one dates set in &quot;the dark room&quot;; on these dates, the man removed his mask in the pitch-black room and Arp was permitted to feel his face. Arp eliminated a predetermined amount of contestants from the competition every week until only one man remained. Upon elimination, the men removed their masks and revealed their appearances to Arp. The series was hosted by American media personality Monica Lewinsky.

==Production==

&quot;Mr. Personality&quot; was filmed in Malibu, California, over the course of three weeks in March and April 2003. Fox searched for men between the ages of 24 and 40 to be suitors while they searched for a leading woman age 25 to 35, all of whom were required to be unmarried and childfree. Approximately 1,000 men were interviewed for a role in the series; the process included two interviews in addition to psychological, medical, and general background screening. Co-casting director Katy Wallin claimed that the appearance of the men was not a large consideration for producers when casting; rather, the producers sought men who had similar interests and priorities as Arp. Lewinsky, who had become well known due to the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, was asked by Fox to host the series in hopes that she would attract more viewers. According to series creator Bruce Nash, &quot;The combination of Monica Lewinsky with a concept like Mr[.] Personality will result in a big tune-in&quot;.

The masks were designed by American costume designer Tina Haatainen-Jones. The network asked Haatainen-Jones to create a mask devoid of any personality that still allowed the men the ability to easily speak. Haatainen-Jones believed the show sounded &quot;stupid&quot;, although she accepted the work due to her status as a freelance artist. In an effort to make the masks unique, Haatainen-Jones crafted them to be reminiscent of a sculpture with a beaten metal appearance. Haatainen-Jones crafted a total of 40 masks, 30 of which were metallic and 10 of which were various colors. The network additionally asked Haatainen-Jones to craft a &quot;chastity mask&quot;, which was bound by leather straps and a padlock. As a result, the mask could only be removed with a key that the network entrusted Haatainen-Jones with. The contestants did not know about the masks until they arrived in Malibu for filming; contestant Brian Karalus stated that he believed the masks were &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Contestant Michael claimed that many of the men wore Maxi Pads underneath their masks in order to alleviate pressure on the bridge of the nose and to absorb sweat. Will Dyck, a real estate investor, won the competition and ultimately proposed to Arp.

==Episodes==
==Reception==
Alessandra Stanley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed that the series was &quot;interesting&quot;, although she criticized its underlying appeal of &quot;snobbism and class tension.&quot; Lisa de Moraes of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the show&#x27;s star a &quot;chick who swallowed a large dose of Stupid Pills.&quot; In 2009, &quot;Time&quot; cited &quot;Mr. Personality&quot; as one of the top ten skanky reality television series.

===Ratings===
&quot;Mr. Personality&quot; premiered to over 12 million viewers; at the time, it was 2003&#x27;s highest viewed premiere of a new reality television show. The premiere placed second in its time slot, although it succeeded in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic. The premiere aired after an episode of &quot;American Idol&quot;, which assisted in boosting its viewership.

<text>Aileen Stanley, born Maude Elsie Aileen Muggeridge (March 21, 1893 – March 24, 1982), was one of the most popular American singers of the early 1920s.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Stanley was the youngest of four children of English parents Robert S. and Maria (née Capewell) Muggeridge who had immigrated from England in 1887. Her sister Elsie Muggeridge, died of typhoid in August 1892, passing it on to their father who died of the disease seven months before Aileen&#x27;s birth. Her widowed mother resided in Chicago along with her surviving siblings, brothers Stanley and Robert Jr.

==Performances and recordings==
From childhood, she sang and danced in vaudeville with her older brother Stanley as Stanley and Aileen, with the encouragement of their widowed mother. After her brother left the act, Aileen started performing solo, forming her stage name by reversing the name of the old family billing.

Stanley performed in vaudeville and cabarets. In 1920 she was a hit in New York City in the revue show &quot;Silks And Satins&quot; and made the first of her numerous recordings the same year. The majority of her records in the &#x27;20s were for the Victor Talking Machine Company, but she also recorded with other labels with recording studios in the New York City area, including Edison, Pathe, Okeh, Brunswick, Vocalion, Gennett and others. On some of her early recordings she was accompanied by Rosario Bourdon&#x27;s Orchestra. Many of her records sold well at the time. According to Joel Whitman, her most successful early recordings included &quot;My Mammy&quot; (1921), &quot;Sweet Indiana Home&quot; (1922), both written by Walter Donaldson; she also recorded other Walter Donaldson songs including &quot;My Little Bimbo Down on a Bamboo Isle&quot; (1920), &quot;Dixie Highway&quot; (1922), &quot;Carolina in the Morning&quot; (1922), &quot;Back Where The Daffodils Grow&quot; (1924), and &quot;Don&#x27;t be angry with me&quot; (1926).

Between 1922 and 1924, and again in the late &#x27;20s, Victor Records produced a popular series of records pairing Stanley with singer Billy Murray. One of Stanley&#x27;s 1925 Victor recordings, &quot;When My Sugar Walks Down the Street&quot;, in which she shared the vocal with newcomer Gene Austin, helped launch Austin&#x27;s illustrious career. She recorded J. Russel Robinson and Con Conrad&#x27;s 1920 jazz standard &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, released as Victor 18703. She recorded the Paul Whiteman and Fred Rose composition &quot;Flamin&#x27; Mamie&quot; on October 5, 1925, and released it as Victor 19828-A accompanied on ukulele by Billy &quot;Uke&quot; Carpenter who provided &quot;jazz effects&quot;.

Stanley also recorded for Black Swan Records, a label purportedly devoted only to African-American artists, under the pseudonyms Mamie Jones and Georgia Gorham. Her handling of blues material was similar to that of some of the northern black vaudeville singers of the time. Her stage appearances billed her as &quot;The Phonograph Girl&quot; and &quot;The Girl With The Personality.&quot; In later life she was overheard to say that the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Get By&quot; was written for her.

==Later life==
Stanley was said to have invested heavily in the stock market and was one of the many who lost most of their life&#x27;s savings in the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Around 1931 Stanley moved to London, where she made more records for HMV from 1934 through 1937, and once confided &quot;strictly entre nous&quot; that she unwittingly ended her own romance when she introduced Wallis Simpson to Edward, Prince of Wales, at the home of Thelma, Lady Furness. In her later years she worked as a singing teacher and vocal coach.

She died in 1982 in Los Angeles, California, aged 89, and was buried (under the name Aileen Stanley Muggeridge) at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale.

<doc id="294229" wikidata="Q751067" url="?curid=294229" title="DragonFly BSD">
<text>DragonFly BSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system forked from FreeBSD 4.8. Matthew Dillon, an Amiga developer in the late 1980s and early 1990s and FreeBSD developer between 1994 and 2003, began working on DragonFly BSD in June 2003 and announced it on the FreeBSD mailing lists on 16 July 2003.

Dillon started DragonFly in the belief that the techniques adopted for threading and symmetric multiprocessing in FreeBSD 5 would lead to poor performance and maintenance problems. He sought to correct these anticipated problems within the FreeBSD project. Due to conflicts with other FreeBSD developers over the implementation of his ideas, his ability to directly change the codebase was eventually revoked. Despite this, the DragonFly BSD and FreeBSD projects still work together, sharing bug fixes, driver updates, and other improvements. Dillon named the project after photographing a dragonfly in his yard, while he was still working on FreeBSD.

Intended as the logical continuation of the FreeBSD 4.x series, DragonFly has diverged significantly from FreeBSD, implementing lightweight kernel threads (LWKT), an in-kernel message passing system, and the HAMMER file system. Many design concepts were influenced by AmigaOS.

== System design ==

=== Kernel ===
The kernel messaging subsystem being developed is similar to those found in microkernels such as Mach, though it is less complex by design. DragonFly&#x27;s messaging subsystem has the ability to act in either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion, and attempts to use this capability to achieve the best performance possible in any given situation.

According to developer Matthew Dillon, progress is being made to provide both device input/output (I/O) and virtual file system (VFS) messaging capabilities that will enable the remainder of the project goals to be met. The new infrastructure will allow many parts of the kernel to be migrated out into userspace; here they will be more easily debugged as they will be smaller, isolated programs, instead of being small parts entwined in a larger chunk of code. Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.

System calls are being split into userland and kernel versions and being encapsulated into messages. This will help reduce the size and complexity of the kernel by moving variants of standard system calls into a userland compatibility layer, and help maintain forwards and backwards compatibility between DragonFly versions. Linux and other Unix-like OS compatibility code is being migrated out similarly.

==== Threading ====
As support for multiple instruction set architectures complicates symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support, DragonFly BSD now limits its support to the x86-64 platform. DragonFly originally ran on the x86 architecture, however as of version 4.0 it is no longer supported. Since version 1.10, DragonFly supports 1:1 userland threading (one kernel thread per userland thread), which is regarded as a relatively simple solution that is also easy to maintain. Inherited from FreeBSD, DragonFly also supports multi-threading.

In DragonFly, each CPU has its own thread scheduler. Upon creation, threads are assigned to processors and are never preemptively switched from one processor to another; they are only migrated by the passing of an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) message between the CPUs involved. Inter-processor thread scheduling is also accomplished by sending asynchronous IPI messages. One advantage to this clean compartmentalization of the threading subsystem is that the processors&#x27; on-board caches in symmetric multiprocessor systems do not contain duplicated data, allowing for higher performance by giving each processor in the system the ability to use its own cache to store different things to work on.

The &quot;LWKT&quot; subsystem is being employed to partition work among multiple kernel threads (for example in the networking code there is one thread per protocol per processor), reducing competition by removing the need to share certain resources among various kernel tasks.

==== Shared resources protection ====
In order to run safely on multiprocessor machines, access to shared resources (like files, data structures) must be serialized so that threads or processes do not attempt to modify the same resource at the same time. In order to prevent multiple threads from accessing or modifying a shared resource simultaneously, DragonFly employs critical sections, and serializing tokens to prevent concurrent access. While both Linux and FreeBSD 5 employ fine-grained mutex models to achieve higher performance on multiprocessor systems, DragonFly does not. Until recently, DragonFly also employed spls, but these were replaced with critical sections.

Much of the system&#x27;s core, including the &quot;LWKT&quot; subsystem, the IPI messaging subsystem and the new kernel memory allocator, are lockless, meaning that they work without using mutexes, with each process operating on a single CPU. Critical sections are used to protect against local interrupts, individually for each CPU, guaranteeing that a thread currently being executed will not be preempted.

Serializing tokens are used to prevent concurrent accesses from other CPUs and may be held simultaneously by multiple threads, ensuring that only one of those threads is running at any given time. Blocked or sleeping threads therefore do not prevent other threads from accessing the shared resource unlike a thread that is holding a mutex. Among other things, the use of serializing tokens prevents many of the situations that could result in deadlocks and priority inversions when using mutexes, as well as greatly simplifying the design and implementation of a many-step procedure that would require a resource to be shared among multiple threads. The serializing token code is evolving into something quite similar to the &quot;Read-copy-update&quot; feature now available in Linux. Unlike Linux&#x27;s current RCU implementation, DragonFly&#x27;s is being implemented such that only processors competing for the same token are affected rather than all processors in the computer.

DragonFly switched to multiprocessor safe slab allocator, which requires neither mutexes nor blocking operations for memory assignment tasks. It was eventually ported into standard C library in the userland, where it replaced FreeBSD&#x27;s malloc implementation.

==== Virtual kernel ====

Since release 1.8 DragonFly has a virtualization mechanism similar to User-mode Linux, allowing a user to run another kernel in the userland. The virtual kernel (&quot;vkernel&quot;) is run in completely isolated environment with emulated network and storage interfaces, thus simplifying testing kernel subsystems and clustering features.

The vkernel has two important differences from the real kernel: it lacks many routines for dealing with the low-level hardware management and it uses C standard library (libc) functions in place of in-kernel implementations wherever possible. As both real and virtual kernel are compiled from the same code base, this effectively means that platform-dependent routines and re-implementations of libc functions are clearly separated in a source tree.

The vkernel runs on top of hardware abstractions provided by the real kernel. These include the kqueue-based timer, the console (mapped to the virtual terminal where vkernel is executed), the disk image and virtual kernel Ethernet device (&quot;VKE&quot;), tunneling all packets to the host&#x27;s tap interface.

=== Package management ===
Third-party software is available on DragonFly as binary packages via codice_1 or from a native ports collection – DPorts.

DragonFly originally used the FreeBSD Ports collection as its official package management system, but starting with the 1.4 release switched to NetBSD&#x27;s pkgsrc system, which was perceived as a way of lessening the amount of work needed for third-party software availability. Eventually, maintaining compatibility with codice_2 proved to require more effort than was initially anticipated, so the project created DPorts, an overlay on top of the FreeBSD Ports collection.

=== CARP support ===
The initial implementation of Common Address Redundancy Protocol (commonly referred to as &quot;CARP&quot;) was finished in March 2007. As of 2011, CARP support is integrated into DragonFly BSD.

=== HAMMER file systems ===

Alongside the Unix File System, which is typically the default file system on BSDs, DragonFly BSD supports the HAMMER and HAMMER2 file systems. HAMMER2 is the default file system as of version 5.2.0.

HAMMER was developed specifically for DragonFly BSD to provide a feature-rich yet better designed analogue of the increasingly popular ZFS. HAMMER supports configurable file system history, snapshots, checksumming, data deduplication and other features typical for file systems of its kind.

HAMMER2, the successor of the HAMMER file system, is now considered stable, used by default, and the focus of further development. Plans for its development were initially shared in 2012. In 2017, Dillon announced that the next DragonFly BSD version (5.0.0) would include a usable, though still experimental, version of HAMMER2, and described features of the design. With the release after 5.0.0, version 5.2.0, HAMMER2 became the new default file system.

=== devfs ===
In 2007 DragonFly BSD received a new device file system (devfs), which dynamically adds and removes device nodes, allows accessing devices by connection paths, recognises drives by serial numbers and removes the need for pre-populated codice_3 file system hierarchy. It was implemented as a Google Summer of Code 2009 project.

=== Application snapshots ===
DragonFly BSD supports Amiga-style &quot;resident applications&quot; feature: it takes a snapshot of a large, dynamically linked program&#x27;s virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start much more quickly than it otherwise would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project&#x27;s history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like those found in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit the most from this support.

== Development and distribution ==

As with FreeBSD and OpenBSD, the developers of DragonFly BSD are slowly replacing pre-function prototype-style C code with more modern, ANSI equivalents. Similar to other operating systems, DragonFly&#x27;s version of the GNU Compiler Collection has an enhancement called the Stack-Smashing Protector (ProPolice) enabled by default, providing some additional protection against buffer overflow based attacks. , the kernel is no longer built with this protection by default.

Being a derivative of FreeBSD, DragonFly has inherited an easy-to-use integrated build system that can rebuild the entire base system from source with only a few commands. The DragonFly developers use the Git version control system to manage changes to the DragonFly source code. Unlike its parent FreeBSD, DragonFly has both stable and unstable releases in a single source tree, due to a smaller developer base.

Like the other BSD kernels (and those of most modern operating systems), DragonFly employs a built-in kernel debugger to help the developers find kernel bugs. Furthermore, , a debug kernel, which makes bug reports more useful for tracking down kernel-related problems, is installed by default, at the expense of a relatively small quantity of disk space. When a new kernel is installed, the backup copy of the previous kernel and its modules are stripped of their debugging symbols to further minimize disk space usage.

=== Distribution media ===
The operating system is distributed as a Live CD and Live USB that boots into a complete DragonFly system. It includes the base system and a complete set of manual pages, and may include source code and useful packages in future versions. The advantage of this is that with a single CD users can install the software onto a computer, use a full set of tools to repair a damaged installation, or demonstrate the capabilities of the system without installing it. Daily snapshots are available from the master site for those who want to install the most recent versions of DragonFly without building from source.

Like the other free and open-source BSDs, DragonFly is distributed under the terms of the modern version of the BSD license.

<text>Van Dyke Records was a budget American record label which operated in 1929 and 1930. Van Dyke was a subsidiary of Grey Gull Records of Boston, Massachusetts and releases duplicated material found on the parent label. Despite claims of quality found on the label, the record was cheaply manufactured, and marketed to record dealers as a budget record with a high profit margin for the dealer. Accordingly the playing surface is noisy, and the recordings are often over-modulated.

Other than jazz by Clarence Williams and Cliff Jackson, most Van Dyke records were dance band numbers by Grey Gull&#x27;s house band, which included Mike Mosiello, Andy Sannella, and Charles Magnante.

The text on the label of Van Dyke 78 discs proclaimed &quot;Each Record a Masterpiece&quot;. An unusual feature of the Van Dyke label was that the four-digit matrix number was split between two lines on the left side. Initially the Van Dyke catalog number mirrored the Grey Gull catalog number, with an added &quot;7&quot; or &quot;8&quot; appended to the beginning. By its second year of existence the couplings no longer matched the parent company, and there was no relation between Van Dyke&#x27;s numbering (now divided into several separate numbering blocks) and Grey Gull&#x27;s. Nonetheless, all material continued to originate from Grey Gull. There was some effort made to obscure the origins of Van Dyke.

When Grey Gull ceased operations in 1930, Van Dyke records also were no longer produced. However, substantial quantities of the product were exported to England over the next few years, by an unknown distributor.

<doc id="294236" wikidata="Q287165" url="?curid=294236" title="Meiji Shrine">
<text> is a Shinto shrine in Shibuya, Tokyo, that is dedicated to the deified spirits of Emperor Meiji and his wife, Empress Shōken. The shrine does not contain the emperor&#x27;s grave, which is located at Fushimi-momoyama, south of Kyoto.

==History==
After the emperor&#x27;s death in 1912, the Japanese Diet passed a resolution to commemorate his role in the Meiji Restoration. An iris garden in an area of Tokyo where Emperor Meiji and Empress Shōken had been known to visit was chosen as the building&#x27;s location.
Construction began in 1915 under Itō Chūta, and the shrine was built in the traditional nagare-zukuri style, using primarily Japanese cypress and copper. The building of the shrine was a national project, mobilizing youth groups and other civic associations from throughout Japan, who contributed labor and funding. The main timbers came from Kiso in Nagano, and Alishan in Taiwan, then a Japanese territory, with materials being utilized from every Japanese prefecture, including Karafuto, Korea, Kwantung, and Taiwan. It was estimated that the cost of the construction was ¥5,219,00 in 1920 (approximately US$26 million today), about a quarter of the actual cost due to the donated materials and labor.

It was formally dedicated on November 3, 1920, completed in 1921, and its grounds officially finished by 1926. The interior volume of the shrine complex when originally built was 650 tsubo. Until 1946, the Meiji Shrine was officially designated one of the &quot;Kanpei-taisha&quot; (), meaning that it stood in the first rank of government-supported shrines.

The original building was destroyed during the Tokyo air raids of World War II. The present iteration of the shrine was funded through a public fund raising effort and completed in October 1958.

Meiji Shrine has been visited by numerous foreign politicians, including United States President George W. Bush, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle.

In November 2024, a 65 year old tourist from America was arrested for property damage after he carved the letters of his last name into one of the shrine’s wooden torii gates with his fingernails.

==Shrine complex==
Meiji Shrine is located in a forest that covers an area of . This area is covered by an evergreen forest that consists of 120,000 trees of 365 different species, which were donated by people from all parts of Japan when the shrine was established. The forest is visited by many as a recreation and relaxation area in the center of Tokyo. The entrance to the shrine complex leads through the Jingu Bashi bridge. Meiji Shrine is adjacent to Yoyogi Park which together is a large forested area. The entrances open at sunrise and close at sunset.

The shrine itself is composed of two major areas:

===Naien===
The Naien is the inner precinct, which is centered on the shrine buildings and includes a treasure museum that houses articles of the Emperor and Empress. The treasure museum is built in the Azekurazukuri style.

===Gaien===
The Gaien is the outer precinct, which includes the Meiji Memorial Picture Gallery that houses a collection of 80 large murals illustrative of the events in the lives of the Emperor and his consort. It also includes a variety of sports facilities, including the national stadiums (Meiji Jingu Gaien Stadium, National Stadium, and the newer National Stadium), and the Meiji Memorial Hall (Meiji Kinenkan), which was originally used for governmental meetings, including discussions surrounding the drafting of the Meiji Constitution in the late 19th century. Today it is used for Shinto weddings as well as meeting rooms rent and restaurants services.

In February of 2023, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government approved a plan to develop 28.4 hectares of Meiji Jingu Gaien. A new sports stadium, hotel and three skyscrapers are planned for the site. In September 2023, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), a UNESCO advisory body, warned of &#x27;irreversible destruction of cultural heritage&#x27; if the project, which will result in the loss of 3,000 trees and open park space, is allowed to be completed.

==Festivals==
Several festivals are held at the shrine per year. Some festivals are held annually. The exhibitions range from ice carving, shodoten (calligraphy winners&#x27;s works), bonsai, Suiseki Masterpieces, Memory Dolls, Chrysanthemums, Dahlia and exhibitions at the Treasure Museum Annex.

* A ring-entering ceremony by a Yokozuna, called , is performed at the shrine in January (usually around January 5–7) and during the Autumn Festival. Also newly promoted Yokozuna usually perform their first ring-entering ceremony here.
* Autumn Grand Festival (From October 31 to November 3)
**October 31 - Autumn Grand Festival Bugaku at the main shrine building
**November 1 - Autumn Grand Festival: Enshrinement Anniversary Ceremony, Afternoon Ceremony
**November 2 - Autumn Grand Festival Morning Ceremony
**November 3 - Autumn Grand Festival Anniversary of Emperor Meiji&#x27;s Birthday

<text>The DC Universe (DCU) is the shared universe in which most stories in American comic book titles published by DC Comics take place. In context, the term &quot;DC Universe&quot; usually refers to the main DC continuity. It contains various superheroes such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Flash, and Aquaman; as well as teams such as the Justice League, the Suicide Squad, and the Teen Titans. It also contains well-known supervillains, including the Joker, Lex Luthor, the Cheetah, Deathstroke, the Reverse-Flash, and Darkseid.

Beyond the main continuity, the DC Multiverse encompasses all alternate realities within DC Comics. The primary universe has been known by various names over time, with recent designations including &quot;Prime Earth&quot; or &quot;Earth 0&quot; (distinct from &quot;Earth Prime&quot;). The DC Universe and its alternate realities have been adapted across multiple media, including film serials, radio dramas, and modern films, with ongoing efforts to address the complex continuity through streamlined storylines and events.

==History==

===Golden Age===

The fact that DC Comics characters coexisted in the same world was first established in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #3 (1940) where several superheroes (who starred in separate stories in the series up to that point) met each other in a group dubbed the Justice Society of America. Earth-Two was the primary world of this publication era, as established in &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot; and &quot;Crisis on Earth-Two!&quot;.

In the Silver Age, the Justice Society was reimagined as the Justice League of America, which was founded with Major League Baseball&#x27;s National League and American League as inspiration for the name. The comic book that introduced the Justice League was titled &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;. However, the majority of National/DC&#x27;s publications continued to be written with little regard of maintaining continuity with each other for the first few decades.

===Silver Age===

In the 1950s and 1960s, DC has introduced different versions of its characters, sometimes presenting them as if the earlier version had never existed, including: Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), and Hawkman (Katar Hol). These new versions of the characters had similar powers but different names and personal histories. Similarly, they had characters such as Batman whose early adventures set in the 1940s could not easily be reconciled with stories featuring a still-youthful man in the 1960s. To explain this, they introduced the idea of the Multiverse in &quot;Flash&quot; #123 (1961) where the Silver Age Flash met his Golden Age counterpart. In addition to allowing the conflicting stories to &quot;co-exist&quot;, it allowed the differing versions of characters to meet, and even team up to combat cross-universe threats. The writers gave designations such as &quot;Earth-One&quot;, &quot;Earth-Two&quot;, and so forth, to certain universes, designations which at times were also used by the characters themselves. Earth-One was the primary world of this publication era, as established in &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot; and &quot;Crisis on Earth-One!&quot;.

===&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;===

Over the years, as the number of titles published increased and the volume of past stories accumulated, it became increasingly difficult to maintain internal consistency. In the face of diminishing sales, maintaining the status quo of their most popular characters became attractive. Although retcons were used as a way to explain apparent inconsistencies in stories written, editors at DC came to consider the varied continuity of multiple Earths too difficult to keep track of, and feared that it was an obstacle to accessibility for new readers. To address this, they published the cross-universe miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; in 1985, which merged universes and characters, reducing the Multiverse to a single unnamed universe with a single history.

However, not all the books rebooted post-Crisis. For example, the Legion of Superheroes book acted as if the Pre-Crisis Earth-1 history was still their past, a point driven home in the &quot;Cosmic Boy&quot; miniseries. It also removed the mechanism DC had been using to deal with continuity glitches or storylines that a later writer wanted to ignore (which is how Earths B and E came into existence) resulting in a convoluted explanation for characters like Hawkman.

The &quot;Zero Hour&quot; limited series (1994) gave them an opportunity to revise timelines and rewrite the DC Universe history. However this failed right out of the gate as the writers had Waverider state all alternate histories had been wiped and yet have the &quot;Armageddon 2001&quot; saga in the timeline which required multiple timelines to work.

As a result, almost once per decade since the 1980s, the DC Universe experiences a major crisis that allows any number of changes from new versions of characters to appear as a whole reboot of the universe, restarting nominally all the characters into a new and modernized version of their lives.

Meanwhile, DC has published occasional stories called &quot;Elseworlds&quot;, which often presented alternate versions of its characters. One told the story of Bruce Wayne as a Green Lantern. In another tale, &quot;Superman: Speeding Bullets&quot;, the rocket ship that brought the infant Superman to Earth was discovered by the Wayne family of Gotham City rather than the Kents.

In 1999, &quot;The Kingdom&quot; reintroduced a variant of the old Multiverse concept called Hypertime which essentially allows for alternate versions of characters and worlds again. The entire process was possibly inspired by Alan Moore&#x27;s meta-comic, &quot;Supreme: Story of the Year &quot;(1997).

The &quot;Convergence&quot; (2015) crossover officially retconned the events of &quot;Crisis&quot; after heroes in that series went back in time to prevent the collapse of the Multiverse. However, Brainiac states &quot;Each world has evolved but they all still exist&quot;. It has been confirmed that all previous worlds and timelines now exist, and that there are even multiple Multiverses now in existence, such as the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; infinite Multiverse, the collapsed Earth, and the Pre-&quot;New 52&quot; 52 worlds Multiverse.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===

The &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; event (2005–2006) remade the DC Universe yet again, with new changes. The limited series &quot;52&quot; (2006–2007) established that a new multiverse now existed, with Earth-0 as the primary Earth.

===The New 52===

The 2011 reboot of the DC Universe coincided with DC&#x27;s publishing event The New 52, during which the publisher cancelled its ongoing titles and relaunched 52 new books, including a number of new books, set within a revised continuity. This follows the conclusion of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; crossover storyline, which provided a jumping-off point for the existing continuity. A number of in-universe changes are intended to make characters more modern and accessible, though the scope of the changes varies from character to character. Some like Batman have their histories left largely intact, though compressed, while others were given wildly different histories and looks. DC stopped putting &#x27;The New 52&#x27; logo on its publications in the summer of 2015, coinciding with the &quot;Convergence&quot; anniversary crossover event which celebrated the history of the DC Multiverse and its various incarnations.

===DC Rebirth===

In February 2016, DC announced its DC Rebirth initiative, a line-wide relaunch of its titles, to begin in June 2016. Beginning with an 80-page one-shot which was released on May 25, 2016, DC Rebirth also sees &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; return to their previous numbering (#957 and #934 respectively), all books releasing at , multiple books shifting to a twice-monthly release schedule, a number of existing titles relaunching with new #1s, and the release of several new titles. DC has used the &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot; and &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot; miniseries as examples of the basis for the initiative, which has been described as a rebirth of the DC Universe. The &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; initiative will reintroduce concepts from pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; continuity, such as legacy, that have been lost with &quot;The New 52&quot; and build &quot;on everything that&#x27;s been published since Action Comics #1 up thru The New 52.&quot;

===DC Universe===
In October 2017, DC revealed that they would be discontinuing the Rebirth branding and logo from their titles in December 2017, releasing everything under a single umbrella title as the DC Universe. Coincided with the release of the New Age of Heroes imprint, DiDio explained, &quot;We want to make it clear that this is all the DC Universe... Rebirth pretty much the DCU now; while we&#x27;re taking Rebirth off the books, we&#x27;ll be following the direction that Rebirth established.&quot; Titles also received new trade dress, with those &quot;that tie in clearly to our larger DC Universe&quot; having a &quot;DCU logo on them&quot; in addition to corner boxes with icons of the characters to help identify the family of titles; titles outside the DCU, such as &quot;Injustice: Gods Among Us&quot; and &quot;DC Bombshells&quot; would simply have the DC logo on them. DiDio also added that the Young Animal imprint would continue as a separate line of titles.

===Infinite Frontier===

In 2021, DC announced a line-wide relaunch of ongoing monthly superhero comic book titles. A number of miniseries and one-shots were also announced. It is the follow-up to the DC Rebirth relaunch.

=== Dawn of DC ===

In late 2022, DC announced a new line-wide initiative titled the Dawn Of DC. The Dawn of DC is a year long story telling initiative with various new, ongoing and limited series. The Dawn of DC titles received a new trade dress. The initiative meant to change the tone for the DC universe into something brighter and lighter, as well as creating more inter-connectivity between multiple series.

==Description==
The basic concept of the DC Universe is that it is just like the real world, but with superheroes and supervillains existing in it. However, there are other corollary differences resulting from the justifications implied by that main concept. Many fictional countries, such as Qurac, Vlatava, and Zandia, exist in it. Though stories are often set in the United States of America, they are as often as not set in fictional cities, such as Gotham City or Metropolis. These cities are effectively archetypes of cities, with Gotham City embodying more of the negative aspects of life in a large city, and Metropolis reflecting more of the positive aspects. Sentient alien species (such as Kryptonians and Thanagarians) and even functioning interstellar societies are generally known to exist, and the arrival of alien spacecraft is not uncommon. Technologies which are only theoretical in the real world, such as artificial intelligence or are outright impossible according to modern science, such as faster-than-light travel, are functional and reproducible, though they are often portrayed as highly experimental and difficult to achieve. Demonstrable magic exists and can be learned. The general history of the fictional world is similar to the real one (for instance, there was a Roman Empire, and World War II and 9/11 both occurred), but many fantastic additions exist, such as the known existence of Atlantis. In recent years, stories have increasingly described events which bring the DC Universe farther away from reality, such as World War III occurring, Lex Luthor being elected as President of the United States in 2000, and entire cities and countries being destroyed. There are other minor variations, such as the Earth being slightly larger than ours (to accommodate the extra countries), and the planet Saturn having 18 moons rather than 19 because Superman destroyed one.

===New Earth===
&quot;New Earth&quot; is the Earth-like home planet to the main storybook characters of the DC Universe - the one with Smallville where Superman grows up, and Gotham City where Bruce Wayne avenges his parents by becoming Batman. This New Earth is part of a larger DC Universe and DC Multiverse.

Originally created from the First Crisis, it was allegedly erased from existence because of the Flashpoint–Convergence effect, being replaced by &quot;Prime Earth&quot;. By the end of the storyline &quot;Superman Reborn&quot;, the timelines of New Earth and Prime Earth have realigned into one single reality.

===Superheroes===

Many of the superhumans on Earth owe their powers to the &quot;metagene&quot;, a genetic feature of unknown origin, which causes some people to develop superpowers when exposed to dangerous substances and forces. Others owe their powers to magic, genetic manipulation (or mutation) or bionics (&quot;see below&quot;). A large power gap resides between most superheroes and civilians. Still others owe their powers to not being human at all (&quot;see&quot; races, &quot;below&quot;). There are also superheroes and supervillains who possess no superhuman powers at all (for example Batman, Robin, Green Arrow or Speedy), but rival their effectiveness with specialized equipment or &quot;to the absolute limit of human potential&quot; training in special skills, such as martial arts.

The humans first began using costumed identities to fight or commit crime during the 1930s. The first superheroes included characters like the Crimson Avenger and The Sandman. In November 1940, the first superhero team, the Justice Society of America, was formed. During World War II, all of America&#x27;s heroes were banded together as the All-Star Squadron to protect the United States from the Axis powers. However, due to a magical spell cast by Adolf Hitler (using the Spear of Destiny and the Holy Grail) the most powerful heroes were unable to enter Axis-held territories, leaving the offensive portion of the war to be fought mainly by normal humans such as Sgt. Rock while the superheroes participated in defensive activities in Allied territories. After the war, under pressure from the paranoid Committee on Un-American Activities, the JSA disbanded. While many types of heroes were active afterwards (mainly non-costumed, such as the Challengers of the Unknown or Detective Chimp), it was not until Superman&#x27;s public debut that a new generation of costumed heroes became active. Soon after, the Justice League of America was formed, and they have remained Earth&#x27;s preeminent superhero team; most DC heroes (such as the Teen Titans) have either belonged to the League at some point, or have connections to it.

As a general rule, being a superhero does not require powers anywhere near omnipotence. Furthermore, even major heroes and cosmic entities have distinct vulnerabilities, such as: Superman&#x27;s weaknesses to magic, kryptonite, and red sunlight; Green Lantern&#x27;s initial problems with wood or the color yellow (which have since been largely overcome); or Batman&#x27;s lack of superhuman powers, which he supplements with keen intellect, constant training, and specialized technology.

Superheroes are generally accepted or even praised—Superman and the Flash actually having museums dedicated to them—by the general public, though some individuals have decided that &quot;the metahumans&quot; must be dealt with less passively. Thus, an organization called &quot;the Dome&quot; was formed to help superheroes who needed to fight crime across international borders; the superhero group called the Global Guardians were their main agents. However the Dome eventually lost out, as its United Nations backing went to the more famous Justice League. In general, DC Comics has led a parody of its own teams and organizations after the &quot;Watchmen&quot; storyline and the Batman run from a dark humor style which began during the 1980s and ended in the early 90s. Superhero teams such as the Doom Patrol and Justice League International led the writers to have a more subtle approach of semiotic dark humor with its own version of over-powered egos dominating personalities.

The American government has had a more wary approach, however. Back during World War II they started &quot;Project M&quot; to create experimental soldiers to fight in the war, such as the Creature Commandos. Most of these experiments remain a secret to the public. Currently, the government deals with metahumans and similar beings through its Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO), and more recently A.R.G.U.S. Covertly, they use an organization of costumed (but non-superhuman) agents known as &quot;Checkmate&quot;. The government also formed Task Force X (known as the &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;) for &quot;black ops&quot;. Most members have been captured supervillains (and thus expendable and deniable assets), and were strongly &quot;encouraged&quot; to join (often with offerings of clemency if they survived their extremely dangerous missions).

Outcast personalities are often relegated to the world of DCU supervillainry. They are then usually well versed in heists, kidnappings and robberies. Villains with meek powers contrive schemes of extraordinary complexity, yet—because of their simple talents—they only call the attention of powerless superheroes like Batman, or lesser superheroes like Booster Gold. When caught, any prison sufficient to contain these villains is suitable. More powerful villains strive to contest for greater goals like world domination and/or universal acclaim (from the public and their villainous peers). Usually more powerful enemies are imprisoned in maximum-level facilities—such as Belle Reve Penitentiary (which also was secretly Task Force X&#x27;s headquarters) and even alternate dimensions or outer space—because they cannot simply be killed by a bullet, electricity, or poison.

Supervillains sometimes also form their own groups, but these tend to be short-lived because most villains simply do not trust each other. Most such teams are formed by a charismatic and/or fearsome criminal mastermind for specific purposes; an example is the Secret Society of Super Villains of which there have been several versions. Most villain teams are usually small, having been formed of individuals who know each other personally, such as the Central City Rogues, or have some other reason to work together (mercenary groups like the H.I.V.E., fanatical cults such as Kobra, etc.).

===Advanced technology===
Technology more advanced than that which currently exists in real life is available - but it is usually very expensive, and usually only rich or powerful individuals and organizations (or the scientific geniuses who create them) have access to them. S.T.A.R. Labs is an independent research outfit that often develops these devices, while Lexcorp is the main company selling them. The government also runs the secret Project Cadmus (located in the mountains near Metropolis) to develop clones and genetic manipulation without the public&#x27;s knowledge. Technology can also come from outer space or different timelines. Apokolips weaponry is often sold in Metropolis to the criminal organization known as Intergang.

Robots and similar creations, including cyborgs, can have superior intelligence when they are created as sentient beings. The Manhunters, the Metal Men, Red Tornado, Robotman, Hourman, and Metallo are but a few examples. These &#x27;beings&#x27; are most often created by individuals who possess vast intellects, like scientists Professor T.O. Morrow (maker of the Red Tornado), Dr. Will Magnus (who constructed the Metal Men) and Professor Ivo (who fabricated Amazo and other advanced androids using a form of Nano-technology developed by Lexcorp). Brainiac also emulates this technology as well as technology from other worlds. Similarly, some characters use technology to enhance their armor or modify cybernetic functions, for example Steel, Cyborg and the Cyborg Superman.

===Hidden races===
There are a few intelligent races living on Earth that the public at large did not know about until recent times. Among these are the Amazons of Themyscira and Bana-Mighdall and the last survivors of Atlantis, who changed themselves into water-breathing forms, including the human-like Poseidonians and the mermaid-like Tritonians. Other species, such as Warworlders, were brief test subjects of Project Cadmus who fled to the Underworld below Metropolis. There is also a tribe of highly intelligent, telepathic gorillas living in Gorilla City, an invisible city hidden in Africa; this is the home of Gorilla Grodd.

Certain creatures created such as angelic beings, timeline driven entities, experimental deformities and dimension creatures are not considered hidden races because it is simply not included. However, it is only because most monsters play a less substantial role in the DC Universe. The plot-lines of Dinosaur Island and Skartaris are but a few examples of the experiments the DC universe contrives, yet its role in DC comics are played down when in comparison to other companies, therefore they are included as being a race from Earth. An easternized influence is more evident in most Marvel Comics literature, while DC Comics are exaggerated, under-influenced or sustained into the belief of comical parodies; e.g. the story-line of the alien, Monstergirl, and her affluent life-style as a teenage recluse who turns into a monster or the purpose of Asmodel, an angelic inter-dimensional being from a conceptual Heaven who comes to Earth. Therefore, these particular races are not considered hidden but alien and extra-dimensional (see &quot;the following sections below&quot; for reference).

===Aliens===

There are many intelligent extraterrestrial races as well. Curiously, a large number of them are humanoid, even human-like, in form (such as Kryptonians, who outwardly appear identical to Earth-born humans); some can even interbreed with Terrans. Some of these races have natural superpowers, but they are usually the same for all individuals of the same race, unlike Earth&#x27;s metahumans. This was explained by the fact that in Earth&#x27;s distant past Martians experimented on humanity, severely culling the metahuman potential; this means that a species that was meant to have a wide range of powers, like Tamaranians or Kryptonians, ended up &quot;just...human&quot;. However, there are also plenty of nonhumanoid races.

The DC Universe has had many natural and cosmic disasters happen to their alien civilizations. The Martians were destroyed by war, the Kryptonians by a dying planet that exploded, and the Czarnians by a plague. Even the Almeracian Empire was victim to impending destruction by Imperiex.

Order is kept around the galaxy by the Guardians of the Universe and their agents, the Green Lantern Corps. Rival peacekeeping organizations include the Darkstars (created by the Guardians&#x27; rivals, the Controllers) and the interplanetary mercenary organization L.E.G.I.O.N. Criminal organizations include the Manhunters, the Spider Guild and the Dark Circle.

Most aliens are from different planets, who have a source of origin near the Solar System and in the Milky Way Galaxy, although, unlike the Marvel Universe, alien colonies are common within the Solar System. The Dominators are an imperialistic race of terrorist aliens who control most of the unknown cosmos in order to extract genetic resources from planets. The caste is also collectively known as the Dominion. Other aliens in the outlying galaxies control armadas like the Khunds, Gordanians, Thanagarians, Spider Guild and, most recently, the Reach. Even though the majority of the DC Universe is policed by the Green Lantern Corps, and later the United Planets, most rogue races strive to conquer the known universe.

One oddity is the Vegan star system. Due to an arrangement with the Psions, the Guardians did not intervene in that system, allowing a cruel empire called &quot;the Citadel&quot; to govern there, until it was overthrown by the Omega Men.

===Cosmic entities===
The Presence is the God of the DC Universe; he created all reality. He is also among the most powerful beings in Creation.

There are several lesser beings in the DC universe that possess god-like powers, through energy manipulation, magic ability, or technological advancement. Magic and the supernatural are often depicted as being real in the DC Universe, though some skeptics, such as Mister Terrific, maintain that there are scientific explanations to all such events. The narration of the mystic and harsh dark reality is more common in DC&#x27;s Vertigo Comics because its stories lurk outside of superhero fantasy; the Vertigo series have beings that relate better to civilian life, although both universes are subject to fantastical realms and unworldly dimensions. Magic is too powerful in the physical world, where harnessing magic can distort and even destroy reality if not properly controlled (e.g., if a Lord of Order succumbs to certain events, so will a Lord of Chaos).

There are several types of cosmic entities, such as:
* Gods: The first beings calling themselves &#x27;gods&#x27; first appeared billions of years ago on another planet, but they destroyed themselves in a terrible war. This unleashed the &quot;Godwave&quot;, a wave of cosmic energy from the Source. This gave birth to other gods across the universe, including Earth&#x27;s. From the planet&#x27;s remains the worlds of Apokolips and New Genesis were formed, inhabited by beings that call themselves the &quot;New Gods&quot;. The Source Wall is an archetype of Buddha on the edge of the known galaxy. Certain speedsters believe in enlightenment in order to become part of the Speed Force (&quot;see below&quot;). Kismet is an immortal god and the embodiment of reality. She was matched with Marvel&#x27;s Eternity in &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;. In mortal form she was a member of the Lords of Order. Depending on the characters, other diverse religious deities from ancient cultures are common. Heroes such as Aztek and Black Condor, or villains like Black Adam, have found knowledge of their native roots in origin.
* Death represents different characters in the DC Universe. One personification of death is the Black Flash, who can represent Death as an internal figure for the speedsters in the DC Universe. Another is Death (&quot;see below&quot;), who resides at the very end of time. The Black Racer appears as Death in the afterlife. There also is Nekron, lord of the Land of the Unliving, who is the embodiment of Death as the ultimate opponent. Death is also one of the Endless, and is the ultimate personification of Death in the DCU.
* The Lords of Chaos and Order: These two groups of magical beings have been fighting against each other since the beginning of time and they often empower others (with &quot;Order Magic&quot; or &quot;Chaos Magic&quot;) in exchange for their acting as their agents. Many magical heroes and villains have been manipulated by them. The Lords of Chaos and Order were killed by the Spectre in &quot;Day Of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special&quot; #1.
* Elementals: The Earth itself has a living spirit called &quot;Maya&quot; who, for millennia, has been creating champions, one for each of the mystical elements, to protect itself, using human beings as their hosts. The Swamp Thing, Firestorm, Naiad and the Red Tornado were some of them.
* &quot;Homo magi&quot;: a species of humanity with the natural ability to use magic, this race almost disappeared after too much crossbreeding with normal humans (it is from them that people in the DC Universe inherited the ability to use magic). The last pure-blooded ones decided to retire to a magical invisible city centuries ago and are now known as &quot;the Hidden Ones&quot;. Zatanna knows many of the race&#x27;s secrets, and Traci Thirteen is currently investigating magical and occult phenomena for the Croatoan Society—both women had &quot;Homo magi&quot; mothers.
* The Endless: Physical manifestations of eternal and universal phenomena that affect the human condition (Destiny, Death, Dream, Destruction, Despair, Desire and Delirium), principally recounted in the Modern Age &quot;Sandman&quot; series.
* Emotional Manifestations: Like the Endless, these beings were created from the emotional energy generated by sentient beings. Each of the seven emotional manifestations of the DCU is represented by a different color (rage - red; greed - orange; fear - yellow; will - green; hope - blue; compassion - indigo; love - violet) and being. The various power-ring based corps of the DCU, most notably the Green Lantern Corps and Sinestro Corps, utilize the energies of these beings.
* Wizards and Sorcerers: Various sorcerers lurk in the DCU. Dr. Fate, Circe, the wizard Shazam, Mordru and Felix Faust are written as characters who use sorcery to both create and destroy. Dimensions, rituals and spiritual realms are sources for magic power as seen in Ras al Ghul&#x27;s Lazarus Pit, Doctor Occult&#x27;s use of the astral plane and the transformations of Captain Marvel.
* Demons: Demonic entities vary from Etrigan the Demon to Blaze, Satanus and Neron. Demonic entities are abundant and come from Hell although some, like Eclipso the vengeance demon (also referred to as the Prince of Darkness), reside on the Moon. Demonic entities from &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; comics are directly linked to Greek mythology such as Hades and Ares. In the Vertigo comics, characters like John Constantine oppose demons influenced by Christian mythology. Most demons are not, however, directly linked to demonology.
* The Monitors were incredibly powerful cosmic beings. Originally, a Monitor and an Anti-Monitor were byproducts of the event that created the Multiverse. As archenemies, they fought for billions of years, before enlisting the help of warriors and causing the Crisis, during which both were killed. After the Multiverse was reborn, the origins of the Monitors was revised. In the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, the Monitors were a vast civilization tasked with protecting and guiding the various worlds of the Multiverse. They were also vampires and had to resist the urge to feed on the universes that they were born to protect.

===Other dimensions===
The DC Universe is composed of a number of different dimensional planes, most notably parallel Earths (see Multiverse), but the latter were eliminated when reality was altered by the Anti-Monitor (although stories featuring parallel Earths have continued to crop up with various rationalizations in the following years). Other types of dimensions still exist, however, including the Antimatter Universe of Qward, the Pax dimension, the Fifth Dimension and the Bleed. Prison dimensions, such as the Phantom Zone, are meant to house superpowered criminals who are too powerful for any conventional means of containment. Dimensions make up many universes, of which some are created and destroyed with help from supernatural forces and elements from which power is drawn. As well, certain dimensions function as crossover opportunities for heroes from different comic book companies to interact, either from competing companies, or from companies absorbed by competitors. The most notable example of the first kind of crossover has been between DC Comics and Marvel Comics, and the latter with Wildstorm Comics. An example of the latter kind of crossover would be DC&#x27;s acquisition of Fawcett Comics, Quality Comics, and Charlton Comics and the absorption into the DC continuity of the original Captain Marvel, Plastic Man and Captain Atom. In this way, heroes originally published by different companies are now part of the same fictional universe, and interactions between such characters are no longer considered intercompany crossovers.

Additionally, the Marvel Comics Universe is also said to exist in the DC Universe as one of the many alternative universes. The reverse may also be said with respect to the Marvel Universe. This is one method of explaining the various crossover stories co-published by the two companies.

====Heaven and Hell====
Heaven and Hell exist in the DC Universe but may not exist in the same continuum. Versions vary from the Vertigo and DC Universe series with writers of the Vertigo Universe depicting them in relation to religion and mythology while the writers in the DCU have a tendency to narrate fantasy.

====Speed Force====
The Speed Force is an extradimensional energy source which provides the speedsters of the DC Universe with their powers. Accessing the Speed Force makes it possible to run at incredible speeds, even faster than light, and even to jump in and out of the timestream, thereby travelling - albeit with a limited degree of control - through time. The Speed Force also acts as a kind of Valhalla for deceased speedsters. &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot; reveals that Barry Allen is a living generator of the Speed Force ever since the accident that transformed him into the Flash.

====The timestream====
It is possible to travel in time in this universe by several means, including moving faster than the speed of light. The Legion of Super-Heroes from 1,000 years into the future in particular have access to time-travel technology (although the threeboot Legion lacks time travel technology) while Rip Hunter is the present day authority of the technology. Originally, it was impossible to change the past, or to exist in two places at the same time (a time traveler appearing in an era where they already existed would become an ineffectual, invisible phantom while there). However that was all changed after the Anti-Monitor tried to change history at the beginning of time during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Also, a number of alternate realities-known as Hypertime-now exist. A group calling itself the Linear Men formed to prevent anyone from changing history. In addition, an enormously powerful being called the Time Trapper, an enemy of the Legion, has been known to manipulate the timestream, even creating &quot;pocket universes&quot;.

Nicknamed &quot;the Flying [[Scottish people|Scot]]&quot;, Stewart won three Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles with Tyrrell, and—at the time of his retirement—held the records for most wins (27), and podium finishes (43).

Amongst his three titles, Stewart twice finished as runner-up over his nine seasons in Formula One. He was the only British driver with three championships until Lewis Hamilton equalled him in . Outside of Formula One, he narrowly missed out on a win at his first attempt at the Indianapolis 500 in 1966 and competed in the Can-Am series in 1970 and 1971. Between 1997 and 1999, in partnership with his son, Paul, he was team principal of the Stewart Grand Prix F1 racing team. After retiring from racing, Stewart was an ABC network television sports commentator for both auto racing, covering the Indianapolis 500 for over a decade, and for several summer Olympics covering many events, being a distinctive presence with his pronounced Scottish accent. Stewart also served as a television commercial spokesman for both the Ford Motor Company and Heineken beer.

Stewart was instrumental in improving the safety of motor racing, campaigning for better medical facilities and track improvements at motor racing circuits. After John Surtees&#x27; death in 2017, he is the last surviving Formula One World Champion from the 1960s. He is also the oldest living Grand Prix winner.

==Early life==
Stewart was born in Milton, Dunbartonshire, Scotland, a village fifteen miles west of Glasgow. Stewart&#x27;s family were Austin, and later Jaguar, car dealers and had built up a successful business. His father had been an amateur motorcycle racer, and his brother Jimmy was a racing driver with a local reputation who drove for Ecurie Ecosse and competed in the 1953 British Grand Prix at Silverstone.

Stewart attended Hartfield primary school in the nearby town of Dumbarton, and moved to Dumbarton Academy at the age of 12. He experienced learning difficulties owing to undiagnosed dyslexia, and due to the condition not being understood or even widely known at the time, he was regularly berated and humiliated by teachers and peers alike for being &quot;dumb&quot; and &quot;thick&quot;. Stewart was unable to continue his secondary education past the age of 16, and began working in his father&#x27;s garage as an apprentice mechanic. He was not actually diagnosed with dyslexia until 1980, when his oldest son Mark was diagnosed with the condition. On learning that dyslexia can be genetically passed on, and seeing very similar symptoms with his son that he had experienced himself as a child, Stewart asked if he could be tested, and was diagnosed with the disorder, by which time he was 41 years old. He has said: &quot;When you&#x27;ve got dyslexia and you find something you&#x27;re good at, you put more into it than anyone else; you can&#x27;t think the way of the clever folk, so you&#x27;re always thinking out of the box.&quot;

At the age of 13, Stewart won a clay pigeon shooting competition and then went on to become a prize-winning member of the Scottish shooting team, competing in the United Kingdom and abroad. He won the British, Irish, Welsh and Scottish skeet shooting championships and twice won the &quot;Coupe de Nations&quot; European championship. He competed for a place in the British trap shooting team for the 1960 Summer Olympics, but finished third behind Joe Wheater and Brett Huthart.

Stewart&#x27;s first car was a light green Austin A30 with &quot;real leather [covered] seats&quot; which he purchased shortly before his seventeenth birthday for £375, a detail he was able to recall for an interviewer sixty years later. He had saved up the purchase price from tips received from his job at the family garage. He took up an offer from Barry Filer, a customer of the family business, to test in a number of his cars at Oulton Park. For 1961, Filer provided a Marcos, in which Stewart scored four wins, and competed once in Filer&#x27;s Aston DB4GT. In 1962, to help decide if he was ready to become a professional driver, he tested a Jaguar E-type at Oulton Park, matching Roy Salvadori&#x27;s times in a similar car the year before. He won two races, his first in England, in the E-type, and David Murray of Ecurie Ecosse offered him a ride in the Tojeiro EE Mk2, and their Cooper T49, in which he won at Goodwood. For 1963, he earned fourteen wins, a second, and two-thirds, with six retirements.

In 1964, Stewart again signed with Ecurie Ecosse. Ken Tyrrell, then running the Formula Junior team for the Cooper Car Company, heard of the young Scotsman from Goodwood&#x27;s track manager and called up Jimmy Stewart to see if his younger brother was interested in a tryout. Stewart came down for the test at Goodwood, taking over a new, and very competitive, Formula Three T72-BMC which Bruce McLaren was testing. Soon, Stewart was bettering McLaren&#x27;s times, causing McLaren to return to the track for some quicker laps. Again, Stewart was quicker, and Tyrrell offered Stewart a spot on the team.

==Racing career==



In , Stewart drove in Formula Three (F3) for Tyrrell. His debut, in the wet at Snetterton on 15 March, was dominant; he took a 25-second lead in just two laps before coasting home to a win by 44 seconds. Within days, he was offered a F1 ride with Cooper but declined, preferring to gain experience under Tyrrell; he failed to win just two races (one to clutch failure, one to a spin) in becoming F3 champion. After running John Coombs&#x27; E-type and practising in a Ferrari at Le Mans, Stewart took a trial in an F1 Lotus 33-Climax, in which he impressed Colin Chapman and Jim Clark. Stewart again refused a ride in F1 but went instead to the Lotus Formula Two (F2) team. In his F2 debut, he was second at the difficult Circuit Clermont-Ferrand in a Lotus 32-Cosworth.

While Stewart signed with BRM alongside Graham Hill in , a contract which netted him £4,000, his first race in an F1 car was for Lotus, as stand-in for an injured Jim Clark, at the non-championship Rand Grand Prix in December 1964; after qualifying in pole position the Lotus broke in the first heat, but he won the second and claimed fastest lap. On his World Championship F1 debut in South Africa, he finished sixth. His first major competition victory came in the BRDC International Trophy in the late spring, and before the end of the year he won his first World Championship race at Monza, fighting wheel-to-wheel with teammate Hill&#x27;s P261. Stewart finished his rookie season with a win, three seconds, a third, a fifth, and a sixth, and third place in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. He also piloted Tyrrell&#x27;s unsuccessful F2 Cooper T75-BRM, and drove the Rover Company&#x27;s revolutionary turbine car at the 24 Hours of Le Mans alongside Graham Hill.

At the start of the season, Stewart won the Tasman Series from his BRM teammate Graham Hill in two-litre BRMs and also raced closely with his great rival and friend Jim Clark who was somewhat disadvantaged by an unreliable Lotus 39 which was let down by its old 2.5-litre Climax engine. In F1, after his promising start the previous year, 1966 was a poor year for Stewart; the 3-litre H16 BRMs were unreliable, although Stewart did win the Monaco Grand Prix in a 2-litre engined car. The most significant event in that year was his accident at the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps, which sparked his campaign to improve safety in F1 and caused him to miss the French Grand Prix at Reims.

Stewart had some success in other forms of racing during the year, winning the 1966 Rothmans 12 Hour International Sports Car Race and almost winning the Indianapolis 500 on his first attempt, in John Mecom&#x27;s Lola T90-Ford, only to be denied by a broken scavenge pump while leading by over a lap with eight laps to go. However, Stewart&#x27;s performance, having had the race fully in hand, sidelined only by mechanical failure, won him Rookie of the Year honours despite the winner, Graham Hill, also being an Indianapolis rookie. Stewart appeared at 24 Hours of Le Mans test day on 3 April 1966 driving a Ford GT40 Mk II version of Holman &amp; Moody and the Ford GT40 owned by Alan Mann Racing.

BRM&#x27;s fortunes did not improve in despite closely contesting the Tasman Series with Jim Clark, who probably raced closer and harder with him than at any time in their careers. While Clark usually won, Stewart won a victory in the New Zealand Grand Prix with Clark attempting to run him down in the last laps with bodywork flying off his Lotus. In F1, the BRMs were still struggling with reliability problems and Stewart came no higher than second, at Spa, while having to drive one-handed while holding the car in gear with the other. In F2 he won events at Karlskoga, Enna, Oulton Park, and Albi in a Tyrrell-entered Matra MS5 or MS7. He also placed 2nd driving a works-entered Ferrari driving with Chris Amon at the BOAC 6 Hours at Brands Hatch, the 10th round of World Sportscar Championship at the time. Stewart also attempted to run the 1967 National 500 NASCAR race but did not qualify for the race.

For , Stewart switched to Tyrrell&#x27;s Matra International team, where he drove a Matra MS10-Cosworth. After a promising start in South Africa with the Matra MS9 development mule he missed Jarama and Monaco due to an F2 injury at Jarama and his first win of the season was in heavy rain at Zandvoort. Another win in rain and fog at the Nürburgring followed, where he won by a margin of four minutes. He also won at Watkins Glen but his car failed at Mexico City, and so he lost the drivers&#x27; title to Hill.

In , driving the Matra MS80-Cosworth, Stewart had a number of races where he completely dominated the opposition, such as winning by over two laps at Montjuïc, a minute in front at Clemont-Ferrand and by more than a lap at Silverstone. With additional wins at Kyalami, Zandvoort, and Monza, Stewart became world champion. Until 2005 he was the only driver to have won the championship in a car built by a French constructor and remains the only driver to win the world championship in a car built in France as well as in a car entered by a privateer team. Also that year, Stewart led at least one lap of every World Championship Grand Prix, and remains the only driver to achieve this feat.

For 1970, Matra insisted on using their own V12 engines, while Tyrrell and Stewart wanted to continue with the Cosworth and maintain their connection to Ford, which conflicted with Matra&#x27;s recent connections to Chrysler. Tyrrell decided to build his own car and in the interim bought a chassis from March Engineering; Stewart took the March 701-Cosworth to wins at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; Race of Champions and Jarama, but development on the car stalled and it was soon overcome by the Lotus team&#x27;s new 72. The new Tyrrell 001-Cosworth, appeared in August and suffered problems but showed promise. Tyrrell continued to be sponsored by French fuel company Elf, and Stewart raced in a car painted French Racing Blue for many years. Stewart also continued to race sporadically in F2, winning at Crystal Palace and placing at Thruxton. A projected Le Mans appearance, to co-drive the 4.5 litre Porsche 917K with Steve McQueen, did not come off, due to McQueen&#x27;s inability to get insurance. He also had a one-off race in Can-Am, in the revolutionary Chaparral 2J. Stewart qualified third, in what was the car&#x27;s first outing, but brake failure ended his race.

Stewart went on to win the F1 World Championship in using the Tyrrell 003-Cosworth, winning Spain, Monaco, France, Britain, Germany, and Canada. He also did a full season in Can-Am, driving a Carl Haas sponsored Lola T260-Chevrolet. During the 1971 season, Stewart was the only driver able to challenge the McLarens driven by Denny Hulme and Peter Revson. Stewart won two races, at Mont Tremblant and Mid Ohio, and finished 3rd in the championship. The stress of racing year round and on several continents eventually caused medical problems for Stewart. He won the 1971 world championship despite having mononucleosis and crossing the Atlantic Ocean 186 times due to media commitments in the United States. During the season, he missed the Belgian Grand Prix at Nivelles due to gastritis, and had to cancel plans to drive a Can-Am McLaren; he won the Argentine, French, U.S., and Canadian Grands Prix to come second to Emerson Fittipaldi in the drivers&#x27; standings. Stewart also competed in a Ford Capri RS2600 in the European Touring Car Championship, with F1 teammate François Cevert and other F1 pilots, at a time where the competition between Ford and BMW was at a height. Their best result was at the 6 Hours of Paul Ricard, finishing second. In 1972 Stewart also received the OBE.

Entering the season, Stewart had decided to retire. In 2023, Stewart revealed on the &quot;Beyond the Grid&quot; podcast: &quot;It was at Indianapolis and I was getting depressed by the pace of my life, the limit of being at home, I had two little boys and of course Helen. I had been doing enormous travel, in the days we speak of and my day as a racing driver, we don&#x27;t make the money that is made today and to make proper money you had to do a lot of races. It wasn&#x27;t just the question of Formula 1, nobody did Formula 1 so I was doing Can-Am, was doing Indianapolis, Touring Cars, GT Cars, everything you can think of on a global basis and most of my friends was dying as it went along. In fact Helen my wife counted 57 friends that had died that holidayed with, travelled with and of course raced with. I think it all got on top of me and I had mononucleosis one year (1971) and had gastritis that burst and thought why am I doing this to this extent. I had made good money.&quot; He nevertheless won at South Africa, Belgium, Monaco, and the Netherlands. His last and then record-setting 27th victory came at the Nürburgring with a 1–2 for Tyrrell. He recalled: &quot;Nothing gave me more satisfaction than to win at the Nürburgring and yet I was always afraid. When I left home for the German Grand Prix I always used to pause at the end of the driveway and take a long look back. I was never sure I&#x27;d come home again.&quot; After the fatal crash of his teammate François Cevert in practice for the 1973 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, Stewart retired one race earlier than intended and missed what would have been his 100th Grand Prix. Stewart had already won the Drivers&#x27; Championship at the Italian Grand Prix two races previously; this was a race where Stewart had to come into the pits to change a flat tyre, and drove from 20th to finish 4th.

Stewart held the record for most wins by a F1 driver (27) for 14 years until Alain Prost won the 1987 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the record for most wins by a British F1 driver for 19 years until Nigel Mansell won the 1992 British Grand Prix. In his commentary work for race broadcaster Channel 9 during qualifying for the 1988 Australian Grand Prix, Stewart said that he had been asked numerous times if he was unhappy about losing his record to Prost, going on to say that he was happy that his record had been taken by someone of the calibre of Prost, as he believed him to be the best driver in F1. Until , Stewart was the only British driver to win three championships; this record was broken by future seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton. When John Surtees died in March 2017, Stewart became the last surviving F1 World Champion from the 1960s. He also became the oldest living F1 winner upon the death in 2022 of six-time race winner Tony Brooks, who raced during the 1950s.

==Racing safety advocate==
At Spa-Francorchamps in 1966, Stewart ran off the track while driving at in heavy rain, and crashed into a telephone pole and a shed before coming to rest in a farmer&#x27;s outbuilding. His steering column pinned his leg, while ruptured fuel tanks emptied their contents into the cockpit. There were no track crews to extricate him, nor were proper tools available. Stewart was rescued by fellow drivers Graham Hill and Bob Bondurant, who had also crashed nearby. There were no doctors or medical facilities at the track, and Stewart was put in the bed of a pickup truck, remaining there until an ambulance arrived. He was first taken to the track&#x27;s first aid centre, where he waited on a stretcher, which was placed on a floor strewn with cigarette ends and other rubbish. Finally, another ambulance crew picked him up, but the ambulance driver got lost driving to a hospital in Liège. Ultimately, a private jet flew Stewart back to the UK for treatment. After his crash at Spa, Stewart became an outspoken advocate for auto racing safety. Later, he explained: &quot;If I have any legacy to leave the sport I hope it will be seen to be an area of safety because when I arrived in Grand Prix racing so-called precautions and safety measures were diabolical.&quot;

Stewart campaigned with Louis Stanley (BRM team boss) for improved emergency services and better safety barriers around race tracks. He said: &quot;We were racing at circuits where there were no crash barriers in front of the pits, and fuel was lying about in churns in the pit lane. A car could easily crash into the pits at any time. It was ridiculous.&quot; As a stop-gap measure, Stewart hired a private doctor to be at all his races, and taped a spanner to the steering shaft of his BRM in case it would be needed again. Stewart pressed for mandatory seat belt usage and full-face helmets for drivers, which have become unthinkable omissions for modern races. Likewise, he pressed track owners to modernize their tracks, including organizing driver boycotts of races at Spa-Francorchamps in 1969, the Nürburgring in 1970 being joined by his close friend Jochen Rindt, and Zandvoort in 1972 until barriers, run-off areas, fire crews, and medical facilities were improved. Some drivers and press members believed the safety improvements for which Stewart advocated detracted from the sport, while track owners and race organizers baulked at the extra costs. Stewart later said: &quot;I would have been a much more popular World Champion if I had always said what people wanted to hear. I might have been dead, but definitely more popular.&quot;

==Consultant==
In 1964, Stewart embarked on a noteworthy partnership with the Ford Motor Company. This collaboration extended over a period of 25 years and significantly impacted both Stewart&#x27;s career and the automotive industry. 

As part of this partnership, Stewart took on the role of a consultant for Ford. His responsibilities included training Ford&#x27;s engineers to recognize and address areas for improvement in vehicle development. Drawing from his extensive racing experience, Stewart provided valuable insights into various aspects of automobile design and safety. His firsthand knowledge of high-performance vehicles and the unique challenges faced on the racetrack proved crucial in guiding Ford&#x27;s efforts to enhance their cars.

Through this collaboration, Stewart not only helped advance the safety and performance standards of Ford&#x27;s vehicles but also reinforced his commitment to improving automotive technology and innovation. His influence contributed to the development of more advanced and safer cars, reflecting a shared dedication to progress in both racing and everyday automotive use.

==Commentator==
===&quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot; and &quot;NBC Sportsworld&quot;===
During the period 1971 to 1986, Stewart covered F1 races, NASCAR races and Indy car races (including the Indianapolis 500) as a color commentator, and also functioned as host for the latter. He was a play-by-play announcer for the Luge at the 1976 Winter Olympics and the Equestrian at the 1976 Summer Olympics (partnered with Chris Schenkel) on &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot;. He was noted for his insightful analysis, Scottish accent, and rapid delivery, which once caused ABC&#x27;s lead sports commentator Jim McKay to remark that Stewart spoke almost as fast as he drove. In his book &quot;Winning Is Not Enough&quot;, Stewart revealed that he used notes to read from to do a TV broadcast as he could not read from an autocue due to his dyslexia. In 2023, Stewart revealed on the Beyond the Grid Podcast &quot;I was doing ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports because I was reasonably good at it, I got to know how to do it by a man called Jim McKay who is the best commentator of sport in the world weather it was the Olympics or all sorts of different sports. I would go to Atlanta, Georgia to do a Stock Car race and we would be telecasting it not live, it would be for the following week or week after that. I would fly in Concorde more often than anything else and fly into the location was of a race, ABC had all the things organised so I would have a helicopter to get me out of the track and get me back into the night flight, I would never take Concorde on the evening flight because it was slower sleeping on a plane than on a 747 but I would always use Concorde from the UK or Switzerland to the United States. I had it very well organised.&quot;

Stewart was often critical of driver safety in his broadcasts especially of driver negligence with fireproof clothes. In the 1977 Daytona 500, Bobby Wawak got burned after his car caught fire, Stewart said: &quot;The drivers themselves are negligent, drivers should always wear flame resistant underwear and thermal underwear. The accident we seen today is just typical if you&#x27;re not properly protected.&quot; Stewart also revealed there was tension between him and ABC Sports producer Roone Arledge as Stewart was doing commercials for Ford Motor Company as well and several of the commercials aired on &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; which he was a regular commentator there and that led him to leaving ABC in 1986. Stewart revealed in his book that &quot;Wide World of Sports began to lose its soul when ABC first merged with ESPN and then with Capital Cities, prompting severe headcount cuts and reduced budgets.&quot; Later, Stewart covered CART-sanctioned Indy car races starting at Long Beach in 1987 on &quot;NBC SportsWorld&quot;, along with Paul Page. He returned in 1988, along with Charlie Jones. Stewart only covered road course and street races in his brief time at NBC. He did not return in 1989 and was replaced by Johnny Rutherford and Tom Sneva.

===Australian and Canadian TV coverage===
Stewart worked on Australian and Canadian TV coverage from late 1986 to the mid-1990s.

===British TV coverage===
Stewart occasionally appeared with Murray Walker as a co-commentator on the BBC&#x27;s F1 coverage, including the British Grands Prix of 1979 and 1993.

==Team owner==
In 1997, Stewart returned to Formula One, with Stewart Grand Prix, as a team owner in partnership with his son, Paul. The team was a development of the previous Paul Stewart Racing team that had previously competed in lower formulae. As the works Ford team, their first race was the 1997 Australian Grand Prix. The only success of their first year came at the rain-affected Monaco Grand Prix where Rubens Barrichello finished second. The following year, 1998, was less competitive, with no podiums and few points.

After Ford acquired Cosworth in July 1998, the team risked designing and building a new engine for 1999. The SF3 was consistently competitive throughout the season. The team won one race at the European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring with Johnny Herbert, while Barrichello took three third places, pole in France, and briefly led his home race at Interlagos. The team was later bought by Ford and became Jaguar Racing in 2000 (which subsequently became Red Bull Racing in 2005). Stewart is also the head sports consultant/patron for the Royal Bank of Scotland. In March 2009, he waived his fee for the year in response to the bank losing £24bn in 2008.

==Honours and awards==
Nicknamed &quot;The Flying Scot&quot;, Stewart received &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1973 &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; award, the only auto racer to have won the title. In the same year, he also won BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Sports Personality of the Year&quot; award, and was named as ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year, which he shared with American pro football player O. J. Simpson. In 1990, he was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame. In 1996, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. In 1998 Stewart received an honorary doctorate from Cranfield University where he later served as chairman of the steering committee for the MSc Motorsport Engineering and Management.

Stewart was a subject of the television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in January 1970 where he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at Thames Television&#x27;s Euston Road Studios. In the 1971 Birthday Honours Stewart was created an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). In 2001, he received a knighthood. In both cases, the honour was for services to motor racing. In 2002, he became a founding patron of the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame and an inaugural inductee. In 2003 the World Forum on the Future of Sport Shooting Activities presented Stewart the Sport Shooting Ambassador Award. The Award goes to an outstanding individual whose efforts have promoted the shooting sports internationally. On 27 November 2008, Stewart was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) degree from the University of St Andrews.

On 26 June 2009, Stewart was awarded the Freedom of West Dunbartonshire at a special ceremony in his hometown of Dumbarton. In 2010, Stewart was named as a founding member of &quot;Motor Sport&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame. On 28 January 2012, Stewart gave the starting command for the 50th Anniversary of the Rolex 24 at Daytona. He assumed the role after previously announced Grand Marshal A. J. Foyt was forced to cancel his visit due to complications from his recent knee surgery. In 2020, the British magazine &quot;The Economist&quot; ranked champion drivers by the relative importance of car quality to driver skill. According to this ranking, Stewart was the 4th best driver of all time, behind Juan Manuel Fangio, Jim Clark, and Alain Prost. Objective mathematical models, such as Eichenberger and Stadelmann (2009, 4th), original F1metrics (2014, 2nd), Bell &quot;et al.&quot; (2015, 4th), &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; (2018, 20th), and updated F1metrics (2019, 2nd), put Stewart consistenly among the greatest Formula One drivers ever.

==Other appearances==
Stewart appears in the 1966 John Frankenheimer movie &quot;Grand Prix&quot; doing all the driving scenes for actor Brian Bedford, who played Scott Stoddard, as Bedford did not know how to drive. Stewart was the subject in the 1972 Roman Polanski-produced film &quot;Weekend of a Champion&quot;, in which Polanski shadows him throughout a race weekend at the 1971 Monaco Grand Prix. He appeared in an anachronistic cameo in a 1977 episode of &quot;Lupin III&quot; as a competitor in the 1977 Monaco Grand Prix. In 1979, George Harrison, a good friend of Stewart&#x27;s, released a single titled &quot;Faster&quot; as a tribute to Stewart, Niki Lauda, Ronnie Peterson, and fellow Formula One race car drivers. He appeared as a spokesman, with his son Mark, in a 1983 commercial for the Vectrex game console. Stewart also wrote the foreword for the book &quot;The Centenary of the Car 1885–1985&quot; by Andrew Whyte in 1984. He participated in Prince Edward&#x27;s 1987 charity television special, &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot;.

Stewart featured in a special presentation video of the then all new Ford Mondeo in 1993, the video was given away free on the front cover of &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine in 1993. He was featured in the video to the 2000 song &quot;Supreme&quot; by British singer, Robbie Williams. Stewart appeared in several UPS commercials in 2002 and 2003 as a consultant for Dale Jarrett to convince Jarrett to &quot;race the Big Brown truck&quot;. He also once appeared on the UK motoring program &quot;Top Gear&quot; as a driving instructor for host James May. He is also interviewed in some depth in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2011 documentary biography of Harrison, &quot;George Harrison: Living in the Material World&quot;. 2018 saw the 50th anniversary of the relationship between Stewart and luxury watch brand Rolex. In 2018, he Stewart appeared in US commercials for Heineken beer, in which he refused an offered beer saying &quot;I&#x27;m still driving&quot; before driving away in a Jaguar F-Type.

==Helmet==
Stewart&#x27;s helmet was white, with the red, green, blue, white, and yellow Royal Stewart tartan surrounding the top.

==Personal life==
Stewart has been married to his childhood sweetheart Helen McGregor since 1962, and they have two sons: Paul and Mark. Paul is a former racing driver, who later ran Paul Stewart Racing with his father, before selling it in 1999. Mark is a film and television producer. Between 1969 and 1997 the couple lived in Begnins, near Lake Geneva in Switzerland, and later sold his house to Phil Collins.

Stewart dictated his autobiography titled &quot;Winning Is Not Enough&quot; due to his dyslexia. In a 2009 interview, and in the book, he discusses his close relationship with his older brother Jimmy, who was also a successful racing driver in his youth but had a long struggle with alcoholism. Jimmy died in 2008. In 2018, he set up the charity Race Against Dementia. In 2016, Helen McGregor Stewart was diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic with frontotemporal dementia. , she has limited short-term memory and impaired mobility, and requires round-the-clock care support. Stewart believes that the application of Formula 1&#x27;s technology and out of the box thinking could bring about earlier solutions to society coping with dementia.

<text>The 2004 Washington gubernatorial election was held on November 2, 2004. The race gained national attention for its legal twists and extremely close finish, among the closest political races in United States election history. Republican Dino Rossi was declared the winner of the initial count and again of the automated recount, but after a second recount done by hand, Democrat Christine Gregoire took the lead by a margin of 129 votes.

Although Gregoire was sworn in as governor of Washington on January 12, 2005, Rossi did not formally concede and called for a re-vote over concerns about the integrity of the election. The Republican Party filed a lawsuit in Chelan County Superior Court contesting the election, but the trial judge ruled against it, citing lack of evidence of deliberate electoral sabotage. Rossi chose not to appeal to the Washington State Supreme Court, formally conceding the election on June 6, 2005. Gregoire was re-elected in 2008 in a rematch with Rossi.

== Primary elections ==
The 2004 election cycle was the first in Washington to use a party-line ballot system of holding primary elections. The state had a long tradition of using blanket primaries, where the candidates of all political parties appear together on the same ballot for all voters. In this system, the leading vote-getter from each party advances to the general election. Washington&#x27;s voters are not registered by party affiliation and a voter could participate in selecting candidates for more than one party, although the voter could only choose one candidate (of whatever party) for each office.

In February 2004 the United States Supreme Court declined to review a lower court decision striking down the blanket primary as unconstitutional, based on it violating the rights of the parties to freedom of association under the First Amendment. Washington was thus forced to devise a new primary election system. The state legislature passed a bill providing that the top two vote-getters for each office in the primary would advance to the general election, regardless of which political party they belonged to. Voters would still be allowed to vote for any candidate as before. However, this measure was vetoed by Governor Gary Locke in favor of a Montana-style system that requires voters to choose a ballot for one specific party and vote only on that party&#x27;s candidates in the primary.

The primary election in 2004 was held using the new system, but a campaign to replace it was already underway. The Washington State Grange, which had helped institute the blanket primary in 1935, filed Initiative 872 to implement the &quot;top-two&quot; primary instead, which would once again allow voters to cross party lines in the primary election but now send the top two vote-getters to the general election. In districts dominated by one party, the top-two system could result in Democrat- or Republican-only general election races. Supporters claimed it would bring back voter choice across party lines and allow independent voters to participate in the primary; opponents said it would exclude third parties and independent candidates from general election ballots, and would in fact reduce general election voter choice. The initiative was put to a public vote in November 2004, and passed with 60% of the vote. The state Republican, Democratic and Libertarian parties sued, however, and a federal district court judge ruled in 2005 that the measure was unconstitutional because it too infringed the parties&#x27; First Amendment right to select their own candidates. Washington continued with the party-line primary system while appealing the case.

=== Democratic primary ===
In July 2003, incumbent Governor Gary Locke indicated that he would not seek a third term, opening up the Democratic primary to alternate candidates. Former Washington State Supreme Court justice Phil Talmadge was the first candidate to enter the race for the Democratic primary, challenging Gary Locke before he announced his retirement, but Washington Attorney General Christine Gregoire quickly became the frontrunner, leading in fundraising and endorsements. King County Executive Ron Sims also announced his candidacy. According to a March 2004, Mellman Group poll, Gregoire would beat both Sims and Talmadge 36% to 11% and four percent in an open primary, and would beat Sims 55% to 17% in a closed primary. On April 29, 2004, Talmadge announced he was withdrawing from the race following the discovery of a benign kidney tumor, citing the likely need for surgery and associated recovery time.
=== Republican primary ===
The Washington State Republican Party struggled to find a candidate through most of 2003 when presumed candidate Bob Herbold, a former Executive Vice President and COO of Microsoft, declined to run. They finally recruited Dino Rossi, a relatively obscure political figure who left the state senate to pursue a gubernatorial run due to state elected officials being prohibited from raising money while the legislature is in session.
=== Libertarian primary ===
The Libertarian Party of Washington State race was between Ruth Bennett, former state chair of the party in Washington and Colorado, and Michael Nelson.
==General election==

=== Campaign ===
Both Gregoire and Rossi ran as centrists and promised to change the political landscape in Washington, and both made job and economic growth the centerpiece of their campaigns.

The Rossi campaign presented its own job growth plan, and stated that 20 years of Democratic governors were to blame for the economic troubles in the state. However, during the general election he was criticized for a strongly conservative voting record that was at odds with his moderate campaign posture. Rossi was also criticized for his long-time professional association with a real estate broker convicted of fraud, and for alleged résumé embellishments. Rossi had worked against &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, attacked opponents for supporting gay rights, and proclaimed that creationism should be taught in public schools. Rossi campaigned on being anti-abortion and in favor of state and federal Constitutional Amendments that would ban certain benefits for gay couples. He downplayed his long history of conservative comments and claimed to be a &quot;fiscal moderate with a social conscience.&quot; Rossi would not publicly state his opinion over stem cell research.

The Gregoire campaign promised to boost job growth in the state which had slowed greatly after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, to improve education, and to increase access to health care. It also focused on Gregoire&#x27;s record of challenging big tobacco and pharmaceutical companies in her tenure as state attorney general. Gregoire also proposed a major state-led initiative in life sciences, especially stem cell research, where she proposed investing US$500 million of a tobacco settlement the state hoped to receive in 2008. Her economic plan for the state focused on improving state infrastructure and improving the quality of education in the state, which she claimed would attract investors. Gregoire also stated that she believed Washington residents should be allowed to buy prescription medicine from Canada, while Rossi said that he needed to be convinced it &quot;was safe&quot;. Gregoire was criticized for being a part of the state government establishment, but tried to counter Rossi&#x27;s &quot;time for a change&quot; message by saying that she would &quot;blow past the bureaucracy&quot; and bring change herself. This language surprised and disappointed many of her colleagues and supporters, who saw it as a failure to give mention or credit to the efforts and achievements of past Democratic governors.

Gregoire was also strongly criticized in many attack ads for an incident which occurred in 2000, when Gregoire&#x27;s office failed to file documents on time to appeal a record $17.8 million personal-injury verdict against Washington. Documents from an independent investigation conducted at the time of the incident show that Gregoire&#x27;s deputies attempted to influence who was listed as responsible for the missed deadline. A further case Gregoire was strongly criticized for occurred in 2002 during a wrongful death lawsuit when Gregoire&#x27;s office did not detect an error in jury instructions. The state was forced to pay $22.4 million to the plaintiff. While Gregoire was not directly responsible for these offenses, the Rossi campaign claimed that she had already cost Washington taxpayers millions of dollars and was negligent.

Rossi won the endorsement of the Republican Party, the National Rifle Association of America, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, several business and medical associations, and former governor Dan Evans. Gregoire received the endorsement of the Democratic Party, GLAAD, the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, abortion rights organizations, and all the previous Democratic governors of the state. However, the Republican Party decided not to fund ads for Rossi in the state as polls leading up to the election date showed Gregoire with a clear lead. Almost all of Rossi&#x27;s ads were paid for and created by outside sources, although as Gregoire&#x27;s lead narrowed closer to the election date, the Republican Party ultimately decided to launch a series of advertisements for Rossi.

Ruth Bennett&#x27;s campaign focused on permitting same-sex marriage in the state and economic liberalization in line with the political philosophy of libertarianism. She also recommended equally dividing the state budget among the counties and allowing the counties to establish tax systems on a county-by-county basis, ultimately leading to a diminished role of Washington&#x27;s Department of Revenue.

Gregoire led in almost all polls conducted leading up to the election, but Rossi was able to close in on her late in the race and won considerable support from Eastern Washington. He also ran much stronger than expected in Snohomish and Pierce Counties. Gregoire received strong support (nearly a three-to-two margin) from the largest county in the state, King County, which includes heavily Democratic Seattle. During the initial ballot count, the lead changed hands several times.

=== Initial results ===
Washington was unusual for a U.S. state in that it only required that an absentee ballot be postmarked by the day of the election to be valid, while most other states required the ballot to have arrived at the election office by that time. Due to this as well as the state&#x27;s high number of absentee ballots—more than 60% of all King County voters voted absentee—the initial result of the election was not known until November 17, the last day under state law for election results to be certified by each county&#x27;s election officials.

The initial result, as reported by Secretary of State Sam Reed, showed Rossi with a lead of 261 votes, well within the margin for an automatic machine recount pursuant to Washington state law (less than 0.5% and less than 2,000 votes). After a statewide recount completed on November 24, Rossi again came away with the lead, this time by 42 votes.

===Manual recount===
After Rossi was certified as the victor on November 29, the Washington State Secretary of State said that &quot;a manual recount was almost a certainty.&quot; This view was shared by the Gregoire campaign, with campaign spokesman Morton Brilliant saying that &quot;if all the ballots aren&#x27;t counted, we will go through the next four years with one candidate&#x27;s supporters not believing the winner was legitimately elected.&quot; and that it was &quot;worth taking three weeks to have four years of legitimacy, and that&#x27;s what is at stake.&quot;

In Washington, a candidate may request one hand count or machine count, provided that they pay for the estimated cost of the recount up front. If a manual recount overturns the outcome of an election, the state will then refund the money to the candidate. On December 3, the Washington State Democratic Party gave a $730,000 check to the Secretary of State for the statewide manual recount of nearly 3 million ballots. The Secretary of State issued the order for a recount on Monday, December 6. The next day, attorneys for the Democratic Party and the Secretary of State argued before the Washington State Supreme Court over terms for the recount. The Democrats argued for a universal standard to be applied to the manual recount, and for the retabulation of votes over simply recanvassing them. Attorneys for the Secretary of State replied saying that any retabulation of votes would be a violation of state election laws and the Washington State Constitution. Two days later, the Supreme Court issued their opinion and rejected universal standards in the statewide recount.

=== Discovered ballots ===

King County Council Chairman Larry Phillips was at a Democratic Party office in Seattle on Sunday December 12, reviewing a list of voters whose absentee votes had been rejected due to signature problems, when to his surprise he found his own name listed. Phillips said he was certain he had filled out and signed his ballot correctly, and asked the county election officials to investigate the discrepancy. They discovered that Phillips&#x27; signature had somehow failed to be scanned into the election computer system after he submitted his request for an absentee ballot. Election workers claimed that they had received Phillips&#x27; absentee ballot in the mail, but they could not find his signature in the computer system to compare to the one on the ballot envelope, so they mistakenly rejected the ballot instead of following the standard procedure of checking it against the signature of Phillips&#x27; physical voter registration card that was on file. The discovery prompted King County Director of Elections Dean Logan to order his staff to search the computers to see if any other ballots had been incorrectly rejected.

Logan announced on December 13 that 561 absentee ballots in the county had been wrongly rejected due to an administrative error. The next day, workers retrieving voting machines from precinct storage found an additional 12 ballots, bringing the total to 573 newly discovered ballots. Logan admitted the lost ballots were an oversight on the part of his department, and insisted that the found ballots be counted. On December 15, the King County Canvassing Board voted 2–1 in favor of counting the discovered ballots.

Upon examination of the discovered ballots, it was further discovered that, with the exception of two ballots, none of the ballots had been cast by voters whose surnames began with the letters A, B, or C. There was a further search for more ballots, and on December 17, county workers discovered a tray in a warehouse with an additional 162 previously uncounted ballots. All together, 735 uncounted or improperly rejected ballots were discovered in King County during the manual hand recount.

Chairman of the Washington State Republican Party Chris Vance stated that he was &quot;absolutely convinced that King County is trying to steal this election.&quot; The National Rifle Association, which had endorsed Rossi, sent a mass e-mail on December 14 to its members asking for volunteers to go to King County in order to sit in on the county elections office and observe the recount.

The Washington State Republican Party filed a restraining order in Pierce County District Court, requesting an injunction against King County to block the tabulation of the uncounted ballots. The request was granted on December 17, but Democrats appealed to the Supreme Court. On December 22, the court ruled against the Republican Party and overturned the restraining order, allowing King County to count all ballots. The next day, Sam Reed issued a statement explaining the process for certification of the uncounted ballots and the standards for fair voting practices in the state.

After all other counties submitted their recount votes, it was revealed on December 20 that at least five other counties besides King County had included ballots that had been discovered after the initial count. For example, Snohomish County included 224 missed ballots that had been discovered underneath mail trays. The outcome of the State Supreme Court hearing regarding King County&#x27;s votes could have potentially affected those counties&#x27; counts as well.

=== Final results ===
The state Democratic party claimed on December 21 that the result of the manual recount, including King County&#x27;s votes, placed Gregoire ahead by eight votes across the state. Later, on December 22, the preliminary recount results put Gregoire at a ten-vote lead.

Washington state law allows for election officials to evaluate voter intent and correct ballots so that the machines can properly read them. For example, on a Scantron or other optical ballot, an election official might fill in a circle that was not properly marked so that the machine may record the vote. Republicans filed a federal lawsuit to stop the visual examination of ballots, claiming that it is not allowed under federal law (Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment). The Republican Party was contending that the method King County was using was different from that of other counties, therefore treating voters in King County differently from those in others. However, the court ruled that this was not the case, as King County was counting their ballots in a manner similar to that of other counties.

A Pierce County Superior Court judge ruled that ballots should not be counted, but on December 22, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that counties explicitly have the ability to correct ballot consideration errors made during earlier counts. Of those 732 ballots, 566 were accepted as having valid signatures and were added to the existing total on December 23. The final results of the hand count, as of December 23, had Christine Gregoire ahead by 130 votes, which was later revised to 129 when it was discovered that Thurston County had added a vote after certification had been completed. Since the recount results were in favor of the party requesting the recount, the Democrats were reimbursed the recount costs they had advanced to the state.

The Republicans were already preparing for further legal action before the final tally was announced by canvassing Republican voters whose ballots had been rejected. On December 29, Rossi called for a re-vote, saying that &quot;this election has been a total mess&quot; and that a &quot;revote would be the best solution for the people of our state and would give us a legitimate governorship&quot;. This solution had been rejected by the Democrats and Republican Secretary of State Sam Reed because Washington&#x27;s election law contains no re-vote provision, which left a lawsuit the only other option. Reed officially certified the results of the manual recount on December 30, declaring Gregoire the governor-elect.

== Aftermath ==

Republican leaders in Washington claimed there were enough disputed votes to change the outcome of the election and filed a lawsuit in Chelan County Superior Court in order to avoid having the case heard in the more liberal Western Washington counties. King County&#x27;s election department (the greater Seattle area) was also targeted for how they handled the ballots, including untracked use of a &quot;ballot-on-demand&quot; printing machine. Also, ballots in six counties were discovered after the initial count and included in the recounts, the most being from King County. The judge hearing the lawsuit ruled that the Party did not provide enough evidence that the disputed votes were ineligible votes, or for whom they were cast, to enable the court to overturn the election.

Controversy over the election&#x27;s outcome continued after the certification of the hand recount results. The Washington State Republican Party called into question the discrepancy between the list of voters casting ballots in King County (895,660) and the number of ballots reported in the final hand recount (899,199). They claimed that hundreds of votes, including votes by felons, deceased voters, and double voters, were included in the canvass. As an explanation, election officials claimed that they had yet to finalize the list at the time, and argued that discrepancies in the two numbers are common and do not necessarily indicate fraud. As the election officials had expected, once the two lists were completed on January 5, the two numbers were indeed very close to one another. Also on January 5, 2005, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published an article investigating votes in King County apparently cast by dead people. The PI uncovered eight cases of votes attributed to dead people; these included one administrative error, two ballots cast by the spouses of recently deceased voters (one who voted against Gregoire), one case of a husband apparently voting his dead wife&#x27;s ballot instead of his own, and a man who legally voted his absentee ballot and then died before election day. One dead woman was marked as having voted in person at the polls.

By law, the result of the election can be contested by any individual who files suit at any time up to 10 days after any inauguration, thereby making January 22 the latest date to have filed any suit. Two private citizens filed challenges to the election on January 6: Daniel P. Stevens of Fall City and Arthur Coday Jr. of Shoreline. The Republican party filed a suit on January 7 in Chelan County claiming that voters had been deprived of their right to a &quot;free and fair election&quot;, and demanding a revote by special election. While the evidence focused especially on problems in King County, adjacent Chelan was chosen as the venue because it was more solidly Republican and the GOP questioned the ability of King County judges to rule impartially in such a case.

Neither suit asked for Gregoire&#x27;s inauguration to be delayed, allowing governor Gary Locke to leave his post as scheduled. Gregoire was inaugurated on January 12. On February 4, Judge John E. Bridges, assigned by Chelan County to preside over the case, ruled that the court did not have the authority to order a re-election. However, in the same ruling, he also rejected the Democrats&#x27; argument that only the state legislature, which then had a Democratic majority, and not the court, had the sole authority to decide whether an election was invalid, thereby indicating that he intended to proceed to trial. Both sides declared victory over this early pre-trial ruling.

The Republicans presented data showing discrepancies in absentee ballot counts from 11 King County precincts. In some precincts, the county tallied more mail-in ballots than there were voters recorded as having voted by mail. In others, the opposite occurred—the county recorded more voters than ballots. The proof that ballots were fabricated for Democrats, Republican attorneys argued, is that four of the five precincts with the most excess mail-in ballots backed Gregoire. And as proof that ballots were misplaced or destroyed to harm Republicans, they pointed to the fact that four of the six precincts in which the most mail-in votes cannot be accounted for backed Republican Dino Rossi.

Additionally, the Republicans contended that King County was three days past its federally mandated due date of October 10 to send out its absentee ballots to overseas military personnel, widely considered more likely to vote Republican. The United States Postal Service Bulk Permit #1455 was used to mail 1,605 ballots on October 2, and 28,000 on October 13. The Republicans claimed that the delay may have prevented military service people from voting, thereby skewing the results in King County. On air, local talk radio host Bryan Suits claimed that his vote in particular was not counted while he performed military service in Iraq.

On February 19 Judge Bridges denied the Democratic motion calling for the challengers&#x27; burden of proof to include a comprehensive list of disputed ballots cast for each candidate. The Republicans acknowledged that such an exhaustive list would be impossible to complete, but continued to argue that the volume of illegal ballots, and the electoral tendencies of the counties in which they were cast, demonstrated a strong likelihood that the illegal ballots had led to Gregoire&#x27;s victory. On February 26, as a part of the Republican suit, Rossi&#x27;s legal team produced a list of 1,135 felons, deceased people, or people who allegedly voted twice, whom attorneys claimed influenced the outcome. A substantial number of the felon-voters were convicted as juveniles and were legally permitted to vote. Conservative columnists suggested that felons were more likely to vote for Gregoire. Most of the felon-voters resided in counties won by Rossi.

As a solution to the problem of the illegal voters, the Republicans proposed a solution of &quot;proportional reduction&quot;. Republicans claimed that it should be assumed that illegal votes were cast in the same percentages as other votes in the same precinct. For example, in a precinct where Gregoire won 60% of the vote, it would have been assumed that she received 60% of the illegal vote as well, and those votes would be subtracted from her total for the precinct. The Democrats countered that the Republicans&#x27; proposal was statistically invalid, an example of the ecological fallacy, and the best solution would be to call each of the felons into court and ask them to swear under oath which political candidate they voted for, after which time their vote would be removed from the total.

The trial began on May 23, with both sides presenting their evidence of manipulation. On June 6, 2005, Judge John E. Bridges ruled that the Republican party did not provide enough evidence that the disputed votes were ineligible—or for whom they were cast—to overturn the election. Judge Bridges noted that there was evidence that 1,678 votes had been illegally cast throughout the state, but found that the only evidence submitted to show how those votes had been cast were sworn statements from four felons that they had voted for Rossi. He stated that the judiciary should exercise restraint; &quot;unless an election is clearly invalid, when the people have spoken, their verdict should not be disturbed by the court.&quot; Nullifying the election, Bridges said, would be &quot;the ultimate act of judicial egotism and judicial activism.&quot; He also concluded that according to his interpretation of the Washington Administrative Code, &quot;voters who improperly cast provisional ballots should not be disenfranchised.&quot; He also rejected all claims of fraud and the Republican Party&#x27;s statistical analysis, concluding that the expert testimony of the Republican party was &quot;not helpful&quot; and that the proportional reduction theory was not supported under any law in the state. Striking another blow against Rossi&#x27;s court case, he stated that &quot;the court is more inclined to believe that Gregoire would have prevailed under statistical analysis theory&quot;, rejecting the Rossi campaign&#x27;s claim that improperly cast ballots led to Gregoire&#x27;s victory.

Bridges did accept the claim that some people voted illegally in the election, but said there was little proof of which candidate benefited from those votes. He ruled that 1,678 illegal votes should be subtracted from the total number of votes cast. Bridges also removed five votes from the final count for two of the candidates: four for Rossi and one for Ruth Bennett. No evidence was brought before the court of any of the illegal votes benefitted Gregoire. The final margin of victory for Gregoire over Rossi was 133 votes. Rossi did not appeal to the state Supreme Court and the Washington State Republican party settled the case after paying $15,000 in court costs to the Democrats.

Judge Bridges&#x27; ruling was seen as a comprehensive defeat for Rossi. The judge admitted nearly every piece of evidence the Republican Party offered and then wrote a thorough, tough opinion rejecting the Republicans&#x27; claims (while criticizing the administration of the election, particularly in King County); Rossi was left with very little legal ground for a successful appeal. After receiving such a negative verdict, Rossi declined to appeal to the State Supreme Court, claiming that the political makeup of the Court would make it impossible for him to win, thereby ending all legal challenges to the election of Gregoire as the Governor of Washington.

The 2004 election became a focus of media attention again in early 2007 when news broke that eight federal prosecutors including John McKay, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington, had been fired. Republicans had hoped that after the election McKay would begin a federal investigation into alleged voter fraud, but he did not; McKay stated afterward that he would not convene a grand jury for purely political reasons and emphasized he had not seen any evidence of voter fraud in the Governor&#x27;s race.

<doc id="294244" wikidata="Q1568355" url="?curid=294244" title="Dorsal fin">
<text>A dorsal fin is a fin on the back of most marine and freshwater vertebrates. Dorsal fins have evolved independently several times through convergent evolution adapting to marine environments, so the fins are not all homologous. They are found in most fish, in mammals such as whales, and in extinct ancient marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs. Most have only one dorsal fin, but some have two or three.

Wildlife biologists often use the distinctive nicks and wear patterns which develop on the dorsal fins of whales to identify individuals in the field.

The bones or cartilages that support the dorsal fin in fish are called pterygiophores.

== Functions ==

The main purpose of the dorsal fin is usually to stabilize the animal against rolling and to assist in sudden turns. Some species have further adapted their dorsal fins to other uses. The sunfish uses the dorsal fin (and the anal fin) for propulsion. In anglerfish, the anterior of the dorsal fin is modified into a biological equivalent to a fishing pole and a lure known as an &quot;illicium&quot; or &quot;esca&quot;. 

Some fishes have adapted their dorsal fins to defend against predators with sharp erect spines and venom, as in many species of catfish, the spiny dogfish, and perhaps the Port Jackson shark,

Billfish have prominent dorsal fins. Like tuna, mackerel and other scombroids, billfish streamline themselves by retracting their dorsal fins into a groove in their body when they swim. The shape, size, position and colour of the dorsal fin varies with the type of billfish, and can be a simple way to identify a billfish species. For example, the white marlin has a dorsal fin with a curved front edge and is covered with black spots. The huge dorsal fin, or sail, of the sailfish is kept retracted most of the time. Sailfish raise them if they want to herd a school of small fish, and after periods of high activity, presumably to cool down. The great white shark&#x27;s dorsal fin contains stabilizing dermal fibers that stiffen dynamically as it swims faster, helping it to control roll and yaw.

== Structure ==

A dorsal fin is a medial, unpaired fin that is located on the midline of the backs of some aquatic vertebrates. In development of the embryo in teleost fish, the dorsal fin arises from sections of the skin that form a caudal fin fold. The larval development and formation of the skeleton that support the median fins in adults result in pterygiophores. The skeletal elements of the pterygiophore includes basals and radials. The basals are located at the base of the dorsal fin, and are closest to the body. The radials extend outward from the body to support the rest of the fin. These elements serve as attachment sites for epaxial muscles. The muscles contract and pull against the basals of the pterygiophores along one side of the body, which helps the fish move through water by providing greater stability. In these types of fish, the fins are made of two main components. The first component is the dermal fin rays known as lepidotrichia, and the endoskeletal base with associated muscles for movement is the second.

<doc id="294248" wikidata="Q845789" url="?curid=294248" title="Observable">
<text>In physics, an observable is a physical property or physical quantity that can be measured. In classical mechanics, an observable is a real-valued &quot;function&quot; on the set of all possible system states, e.g., position and momentum. In quantum mechanics, an observable is an operator, or gauge, where the property of the quantum state can be determined by some sequence of operations. For example, these operations might involve submitting the system to various electromagnetic fields and eventually reading a value.

Physically meaningful observables must also satisfy transformation laws that relate observations performed by different observers in different frames of reference. These transformation laws are automorphisms of the state space, that is bijective transformations that preserve certain mathematical properties of the space in question.

== Quantum mechanics ==

In quantum mechanics, observables manifest as self-adjoint operators on a separable complex Hilbert space representing the quantum state space. Observables assign values to outcomes of &quot;particular measurements&quot;, corresponding to the eigenvalue of the operator. If these outcomes represent physically allowable states (i.e. those that belong to the Hilbert space) the eigenvalues are real; however, the converse is not necessarily true. As a consequence, only certain measurements can determine the value of an observable for some state of a quantum system. In classical mechanics, &quot;any&quot; measurement can be made to determine the value of an observable.

The relation between the state of a quantum system and the value of an observable requires some linear algebra for its description. In the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, up to a phase constant, pure states are given by non-zero vectors in a Hilbert space &quot;V&quot;. Two vectors v and w are considered to specify the same state if and only if formula_1 for some non-zero formula_2. Observables are given by self-adjoint operators on &quot;V&quot;. Not every self-adjoint operator corresponds to a physically meaningful observable. Also, not all physical observables are associated with non-trivial self-adjoint operators. For example, in quantum theory, mass appears as a parameter in the Hamiltonian, not as a non-trivial operator.

In the case of transformation laws in quantum mechanics, the requisite automorphisms are unitary (or antiunitary) linear transformations of the Hilbert space &quot;V&quot;. Under Galilean relativity or special relativity, the mathematics of frames of reference is particularly simple, considerably restricting the set of physically meaningful observables.

In quantum mechanics, measurement of observables exhibits some seemingly unintuitive properties. Specifically, if a system is in a state described by a vector in a Hilbert space, the measurement process affects the state in a non-deterministic but statistically predictable way. In particular, after a measurement is applied, the state description by a single vector may be destroyed, being replaced by a statistical ensemble. The irreversible nature of measurement operations in quantum physics is sometimes referred to as the measurement problem and is described mathematically by quantum operations. By the structure of quantum operations, this description is mathematically equivalent to that offered by the relative state interpretation where the original system is regarded as a subsystem of a larger system and the state of the original system is given by the partial trace of the state of the larger system.

In quantum mechanics, dynamical variables formula_3 such as position, translational (linear) momentum, orbital angular momentum, spin, and total angular momentum are each associated with a self-adjoint operator formula_4 that acts on the state of the quantum system. The eigenvalues of operator formula_4 correspond to the possible values that the dynamical variable can be observed as having. For example, suppose formula_6 is an eigenket (eigenvector) of the observable formula_4, with eigenvalue formula_8, and exists in a Hilbert space. Then
formula_9

This eigenket equation says that if a measurement of the observable formula_4 is made while the system of interest is in the state formula_11, then the observed value of that particular measurement must return the eigenvalue formula_8 with certainty. However, if the system of interest is in the general state formula_13 (and formula_14 and formula_11 are unit vectors, and the eigenspace of formula_8 is one-dimensional), then the eigenvalue formula_8 is returned with probability formula_18, by the Born rule.

=== Compatible and incompatible observables in quantum mechanics ===
A crucial difference between classical quantities and quantum mechanical observables is that some pairs of quantum observables may not be simultaneously measurable, a property referred to as complementarity. This is mathematically expressed by non-commutativity of their corresponding operators, to the effect that the commutator
formula_19

This inequality expresses a dependence of measurement results on the order in which measurements of observables formula_4 and formula_21 are performed. A measurement of formula_4 alters the quantum state in a way that is incompatible with the subsequent measurement of formula_21 and vice versa.

Observables corresponding to commuting operators are called &quot;compatible observables&quot;. For example, momentum along say the formula_24 and formula_25 axis are compatible. Observables corresponding to non-commuting operators are called &quot;incompatible observables&quot; or &quot;complementary variables&quot;. For example, the position and momentum along the same axis are incompatible. 

Incompatible observables cannot have a complete set of common eigenfunctions. Note that there can be some simultaneous eigenvectors of formula_4 and formula_21, but not enough in number to constitute a complete basis.

<text>The British Grand Prix is a Grand Prix motor racing event organised in the United Kingdom by Motorsport UK. First held by the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) in 1926, the British Grand Prix has been held annually since 1948 and has been a round of the FIA Formula One World Championship every year since 1950. In 1952, following the transfer of the lease of the Silverstone Circuit to the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club, the RAC delegated the organisation of races held at Silverstone to the BRDC, and those held at Aintree to the British Automobile Racing Club. This arrangement lasted until the RAC created the Motor Sports Association in the late 1970s and it reclaimed organising control of the event. The RAC MSA was renamed Motorsport UK in 2019 when it formally split from the RAC.

The British Grand Prix is currently held at the Silverstone Circuit near the village of Silverstone in Northamptonshire in England. The 2019 event was the 70th time that the race had been run as a World Championship event since the inaugural season in , and the 53rd time that a World Championship round had been held at Silverstone.

The British race is the oldest in the Formula One World Championship calendar as the 1950 race at Silverstone was round one of the first championship season in . It and the Italian Grand Prix are the only two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix that have been staged during every season that the championship has been held. The British Grand Prix was a round of the World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship in both 1926 and 1927, but was never held during the existence of the European Championship. It was designated the European Grand Prix five times between 1950 and 1977, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe. All British Grands Prix dating back to 1926 have been held in England, where the British motor racing industry is primarily located.

The event is due to take place at Silverstone Circuit until at least 2034.
==History==
===Brooklands (1926–1927)===
The concrete Brooklands oval was built in 1907 near Weybridge in Surrey, located just outside the British capital of London. It was the first purpose-built motor racing venue, as well as one of the first airfields in the United Kingdom. Grand Prix motor racing first came to Britain in 1926, following the successes of Henry Segrave in winning the 1923 French Grand Prix and the San Sebastián Grand Prix the following year, both in a Sunbeam Grand Prix car, which raised interest in the sport domestically and demonstrated to the AIACR that the advances made in the British motor industry merited the honour of hosting an international grand prix motor race. The first ever British Grand Prix (officially known as the Grand Prix of the Royal Automobile Club) was held at Brooklands on 7 August 1926 and was won by Robert Sénéchal and Louis Wagner driving a Delage 15 S 8. The second Grand Prix of the RAC was also held at Brooklands, on 1 October 1927, and was again won by a Delage 15 S 8, this time driven by Robert Benoist.

Several non-championship races known as the Donington Grand Prix were held at Donington Park in Leicestershire near Derby which attracted the best European teams in 1937 and 1938, where the German Mercedes and Auto Unions dominated the proceedings. The German Bernd Rosemeyer and the Italian Tazio Nuvolari (both driving mid-engined Auto Union cars) won this race in 1937 and 1938, respectively, but as the races were organised by the Derby &amp; District Motor Club rather than by (or on behalf of) the Royal Automobile Club, they are not usually accorded the &quot;British Grand Prix&quot; title.

===Silverstone (1948–1954)===

Brooklands had been severely damaged by the onset of World War II and the circuit was abandoned. Most new British circuits were being built on disused Royal Air Force airfields, and Silverstone, located on the Northamptonshire/Buckinghamshire border in central England equidistant between London and Birmingham (the latter being the capital of the UK production car industry)- was one of those circuits. It staged its first race, the Royal Automobile Club International Grand Prix on 2 October 1948, which was won by Italian Luigi Villoresi in a Maserati. In 1949, the circuit was heavily modified and made very fast; and it remained in this configuration for decades.

In 1950, the World Championship of Drivers was introduced, and the 1950 British Grand Prix was the first World Championship Formula One race ever held, with new regulations and 6 other races in Europe. This race was won by Alfa Romeo driver Giuseppe &quot;Nino&quot; Farina. King George VI was among the attendees of the race. The 1951 race was particularly exciting, as it was the first F1 race not won by an Alfa Romeo; the gas-guzzling Italian cars were beaten by another Italian car- the more fuel-efficient Ferrari of Argentine José Froilán González in what was the famed Scuderia&#x27;s first ever Formula One victory. For the 1952 event, the original pits between Abbey and Woodcote were abandoned and demolished. A new pit complex was constructed between Woodcote and Copse corners; Alberto Ascari dominated this and the next year&#x27;s race; González won again in 1954 in a Ferrari.

===Silverstone and Aintree (1955–1962)===

In 1955, the Formula One circus began to alternate between Silverstone and the Aintree circuit, located on the Grand National horse racing course near Liverpool. Mercedes drivers Juan Manuel Fangio and home favourite Stirling Moss arrived at Aintree expecting to win. They took the lead at the start and the two drivers battled throughout, and Moss passed Fangio on the 26th lap, and he kept the lead for a while; but Fangio fought back and was about to pass Moss on the last corner on the last lap, and all were certain Fangio would pip Moss at the chequered flag. But he didn&#x27;t, and Moss won his first Formula One race on home soil. Moss later asked Fangio &quot;did you let me through?&quot; and the Argentine replied &quot;No. You were better than me that day.&quot; Mercedes romped to the finish 1–2–3–4, with German Karl Kling and Italian Piero Taruffi finishing 3rd and 4th.

The even-numbered years were at Silverstone and the odd numbered and 1962 were at Aintree. 1956 saw Fangio win in a Ferrari, and 1957 returned to see Moss win again in a Vanwall; he took over his ill teammate Tony Brooks&#x27;s car and stormed through the field to take victory. This was the first Grand Prix victory for a British-built car- Formula One would soon be mostly made up of British teams. 1958 was when Peter Collins won in a Ferrari and Bernie Ecclestone was entered in a Connaught but his car was driven by Jack Fairman, and 1959 and 1960 saw Australian Jack Brabham win in a mid-engined Cooper. The last race at Aintree was in 1962 when Briton Jim Clark won his first of 5 British Grands Prix; Aintree was decommissioned in 1964.

===Silverstone and Brands Hatch (1963–1986)===

1964 saw the first Formula One race at the southern English circuit known as Brands Hatch, located in ancient woodlands in Kent, just outside London. The track was built in the early 1950s and had been extended in 1960 to include the new Grand Prix course. Silverstone hosted the British Grand Prix in odd-numbered years and Brands Hatch in even-numbered years. Like Silverstone, the circuit was popular with drivers, and unlike the flat Northamptonshire circuit and Aintree, Brands Hatch had many cambered corners and varying elevation. Like the year before at Silverstone, Clark won the 1964 race and the next year&#x27;s race. 1967 saw Clark take yet another dominant win, and 1968 saw a monumental battle between Swiss Jo Siffert in a Lotus and New Zealander Chris Amon in a Ferrari; Siffert won the race, his first of two victories in F1 on the circuit where he would lose his life in a non-championship race three years later.

1969 saw another big battle between home favourite Jackie Stewart and Austrian Jochen Rindt, that went on for a while; although Rindt had a loose rear wing and had to come into the pits to get it repaired; Stewart took the chequered flag driving a Ford/Cosworth-powered Matra for Ken Tyrrell. Rindt won the 1970 event at the expense of Brabham running out of fuel at the end of the race, and 1971 saw Stewart win again in a Tyrrell (Ken Tyrrell had started building his own cars). 1973, however, saw a huge first lap accident at Woodcote that took out 11 cars, including all three works Surtees cars. Amazingly, there were no deaths or any fires and the worst news was that Andrea de Adamich received career-ending ankle injuries. 1974 saw Austrian up-and-comer Niki Lauda dominate the race in his Ferrari, however, a rear-tire puncture slowed his car and rivals Jody Scheckter and Emerson Fittipaldi passed Lauda to take 1st and 2nd.

1975 saw a chicane added to Woodcote to slow cars going through the very high-speed corner; and this was another race of variables as a rainstorm hit the track and a number of drivers including Scheckter and Briton James Hunt hydroplaned off the track at the same corner; Fittipaldi won the race after it was called short. 1976 also saw changes to Brands Hatch including making the fearsome Paddock Hill bend a bit tamer, South Bank corner more of a left-hand apex rather than a long hairpin and moving Bottom Straight further south so that the pits and paddock area could be expanded. This race proved to be very controversial; as home favourite Hunt won the race but was later disqualified following a protest from Ferrari and other teams about Hunt not completing the first lap of the race; and the victory went to second-placed Lauda. 1977 saw Hunt take victory without any controversy and when F1 returned to Silverstone two years later, Australian Alan Jones lapped the circuit more than 6 seconds inside the lap record in his ground-effect Williams. His teammate Clay Regazzoni won the race, Williams&#x27;s first F1 victory. 1980 saw Jones win after the Ligiers of Jacques Laffite and Didier Pironi retired; and 1981 saw French rising star Alain Prost thoroughly dominate the first part race in his Renault; and there was an accident involving Canadian Gilles Villeneuve at the Woodcote Chicane which held up Briton John Watson; but Watson passed several cars and won the race; the first for a car with an all-carbon fibre chassis. 1982 saw polesitter Keke Rosberg having to start from the back due to problems with his Williams and he began a charge that brought him far up the field; but he retired, and there was another spectacular showing from Briton Derek Warwick in his underfunded Toleman; he managed to pass Pironi for 2nd, but he also retired with a broken driveshaft; the victory went to Austrian Lauda.

1983 saw Prost win his first of five British Grands Prix and a spectacular performance from Briton Nigel Mansell in his first outing in a turbocharged Lotus, he started 16th and finished 4th. Lauda won again at Brands Hatch in 1984, during which FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre announced that the Tyrrell team was to be excluded from that year&#x27;s championship for fuel irregularities, and the restarted race after a huge accident at Bottom Bend caused more controversy; Prost and Lauda had passed Brazilian Nelson Piquet on the last lap of the first race, but Piquet started in front of the two McLaren drivers; regulations dictated that the positions were on the grid were to be determined two laps before the restart was called; and an irate Prost made scathing comments about his countryman Balestre.

1985 was to see Keke Rosberg set the all-time Formula 1 qualifying lap record for 17 years after posting a fastest qualifying time for the race with an average speed of . Silverstone, which was already a very fast circuit, was becoming faster and faster and the cars were lapping the circuit in the low 1-minute range. The race was an exciting one with Brazilian rising star Ayrton Senna making a great start from 4th and taking the lead by the first corner. He led until late in the race when his car was running out of fuel while Prost was pushing him hard; Senna eventually ran out of fuel and Prost went on to take victory. 1986 saw a huge crowd thanks to Mansell being a favourite to win; his newly found fame and place in a competitive team would help the British Grand Prix to see huge crowds for several years. This race saw 42-year-old Jacques Laffite get involved in a first corner accident and slam head-on into the barriers, breaking both his legs and ending his Formula One career. Nigel Mansell, whose car broke at the start of the first race, got into his teammate Piquet&#x27;s spare car and won the race; although this was the last F1 race at Brands Hatch. A number of people had concerns about the speeds of the cars on the small track; particularly the European Grand Prix held at Brands Hatch the previous year. The southern English circuit was getting to be very fast- now with these -plus, cars, pole sitter Piquet&#x27;s average qualifying speed was and his lap time was in the 1 minute 6-second range, compared to the 1 minute 20-second range in 1976. But Brands Hatch&#x27;s demise was for other reasons: the international motorsports governing body at the time, (FISA), had instituted a policy of long-term contracts for one circuit per Grand Prix. Brands Hatch was perceived as a poorer facility, and considering most of the track was located in a very old forest it did have very little run-off and room to expand, something Silverstone had in acres. Silverstone and the BRDC had signed a seven-year contract with Formula 1 and FISA at some point in 1986, to run from 1987 to 1993.

===Silverstone&#x27;s evolution (1987–present)===

1987 saw Silverstone modified; the Woodcote chicane was no longer used and a new left-right chicane was built on the Farm Straight just before Woodcote. Silverstone&#x27;s layout, like Brands Hatch, had changed little since 1949. The circuit was still fast, and it saw Mansell charge after Piquet (who had decided to run the whole race on one set of tyres) and the British driver broke the lap record 11 times, caught and passed Piquet and took victory; the Silverstone crowd broke ranks and ran onto the circuit after the race was over; this was to start a number of dramatic events surrounding Mansell for the next 5 years. 1988 saw Senna win a rain-soaked event, and Mansell finished 2nd after driving very hard and passing many cars to attempt to catch Senna; this was one of Mansell&#x27;s two race finishes that season. 1989 saw Prost win in a McLaren after his teammate Senna went off at Becketts; Mansell finished 2nd again driving for Ferrari; and sometime after the event, it was decided that Silverstone, the fastest circuit on the Formula One calendar, was to be heavily modified, and the project would be completed for 1991. The 1990 Grand Prix was the last motor race on the high-speed circuit; and Mansell drove hard and led a lot of the race; but gearbox problems eventually forced him to retire, where he threw his gloves into the crowd and announced that he was going to retire, a decision that he would later take back; and he effectively dominated the next two events, driving for Williams. The circuit was now more technical, 15 percent slower and every corner on the circuit except Copse was different. It also included an infield section right before the pits. After 1992, Mansell had retired from F1, and 1993 saw new Williams driver Damon Hill lead much of the race until his engine blew up, and Hill&#x27;s French teammate Alain Prost took his 50th career Grand Prix win.

After the tragedies of Imola in 1994, a chicane was installed at the flat-out Abbey corner 6 weeks before the event was due to take place and Stowe corner was slowed considerably. Hill won the event, something his double world champion father Graham never did. 1995 saw another British driver, Johnny Herbert, take victory in his Benetton. 1996 saw further changes to the circuit, where Stowe was more or less restored to its 1991 design, and the 1999 event saw double world champion Michael Schumacher crash heavily at Stowe; he broke his leg, missed many races and this put him out of championship contention. There were attempts to bring the British GP back to Brands Hatch for 2002, but this never materialised.

The 2003 event was disrupted by a defrocked priest, Cornelius Horan, who ran onto the Hangar Straight during the race while cars were coming at him at over . Marshals were able to get him off the track before he hurt himself or anyone else and he was later arrested; Brazilian Rubens Barrichello won the race for Ferrari. A dispute between Silverstone&#x27;s owners, the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club (BRDC), and the Formula One authorities in 2003 over the funding of necessary improvements to the track&#x27;s facilities led to doubts over the future of the race. In October 2004 the British Grand Prix was left off the preliminary race schedule for 2005 because the BRDC refused to pay the race fee demanded by Bernie Ecclestone. However, after months of negotiation between the BRDC, Ecclestone and the Formula One constructors, a deal was made for the Grand Prix to be held at Silverstone until 2009. 2008 saw Briton Lewis Hamilton win in pouring rain for McLaren; Hamilton and Jenson Button&#x27;s presence and success in Formula One helped to see huge crowds at Silverstone not seen since Nigel Mansell&#x27;s time in the sport. On 4 July, it was announced that Donington Park had been awarded the contract to host the British Grand Prix for 10 years from 2010. However, Donington failed to secure the necessary funding to host the race, and its contract was terminated in November 2009. On 7 December 2009, Silverstone signed a 17-year contract to host the British Grand Prix from 2010 onwards. 

The 2010 race saw a new circuit configuration being used, using the brand new &quot;Arena&quot; layout. For 2011 a new pit complex was built between Club and Abbey Corners, to where the start/finish line was moved. Silverstone is still a very fast circuit- with average speeds up in the range for Formula 1 cars; one of the highest average speeds on the F1 calendar. In 2017, home hero Lewis Hamilton achieved his first – and as of 2023, only – grand slam at his home race at Silverstone. The 2019 race saw an intense battle against Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen, which would eventually see Leclerc&#x27;s teammate Sebastian Vettel join the fray; Vettel locked up, causing him to collide with Verstappen and sending them into the gravel. In 2020, Hamilton brought the car home with a punctured tyre for a sixth British Grand Prix victory. The 2021 installment would see Hamilton collide with polesitter and championship leader Verstappen at Copse corner, sending the Red Bull driver into the wall at . The following year would also see another car collide with the barriers in a major incident; this time with Zhou Guanyu&#x27;s Alfa Romeo down the start-finish straight following an incident involving Pierre Gasly and George Russell. The race also saw Ferrari&#x27;s Carlos Sainz Jr. win his first race in his Formula One career.

On 11 July 2017, the BRDC, the owners of Silverstone, activated a break clause in their contract meaning unless a new contract was signed, 2019 would be the final year the British Grand Prix took place at Silverstone. However, in July 2019 a few days before the 2019 edition it was confirmed that Silverstone was contracted to host the British Grand Prix until at least 2024.

In September 2022, Silverstone was criticised during the initial sale of tickets for the 2023 British Grand Prix. The track instituted a &#x27;dynamic pricing&#x27; model of prices refreshing every 90 seconds based on demand, and then encouraged fans to access its online ticketing system immediately after sales began. The rush of fans led to surges in pricing and crashes to the ticket sales website. Silverstone was forced to suspend sales and apologise to fans.

On 8 February 2024, Silverstone and Formula One extended its contract to host the British Grand Prix until 2034.

At the 2024 British Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton, on his final season driving for Mercedes, won the race for the ninth time. The 104th win of his career, it broke Michael Schumacher&#x27;s record for most wins at a single circuit.

== Venues ==


== Trophies and awards ==

=== The Royal Automobile Club Trophy ===
Since 1950, it has been customary that the winner of the race is awarded the official RAC British Grand Prix Trophy, a perpetual trophy awarded each year and then returned to the Royal Automobile Club, where it is permanently housed. From 1950 until 1972, the official trophy was the Mervyn O&#x27;Gorman Trophy, but this was replaced from 1973 by the present gold cup.

=== Sponsor&#x27;s Trophy ===
Since 1952, the winner of the British Grand Prix has generally also been awarded a trophy by the principal sponsor of the race (for 1952, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;), which is won outright each year and replaced by a new trophy for the following year&#x27;s event. In some years, it is the sponsor&#x27;s trophy, rather than the official RAC trophy, which is handed to the winner on the podium, which is why post-race photographs since 1950 have shown many more than the two official trophies that have ever been awarded.

=== Prize money ===
Before the institution of a winner&#x27;s trophy, the only award for being placed in the British Grand Prix was the prize money on offer. For the first two British Grands Prix held at Brooklands, the prize money was £1,000 to the winner, £300 to the second-placed finisher and £200 for finishing third. For the first post-Second World War British Grand Prix in 1948, prize money was offered to the entrants of the top ten finishers, ranging from £500 to the winner to £20 for tenth place, and the amounts awarded changed little over the next few years, although by 1958 the winner&#x27;s prize had increased to £750.

A cash prize was also awarded for the fastest lap of the race from 1948, when the prize amounted to £25. By 1953, this prize was no longer offered.

=== Fred G. Craner Memorial Trophy ===
In addition to the official winner&#x27;s trophy, in 1950 the RAC also awarded for the first time a further perpetual trophy, the Fred G. Craner Memorial Car Trophy, for the highest-placed British competitor driving a British car, which was awarded until at least 1972. Fred Craner had been secretary of the Derby &amp; District Motor Club and instrumental in establishing Donington Park as a motor racing circuit and in organising the Donington Grands Prix. The first winner of this trophy was F R &quot;Bob&quot; Gerard driving an ERA, who finished fifth overall. The first occasion on which the winners of the British Grand Prix also won the Fred G. Craner Memorial Trophy was at Aintree in 1957, when the winners were Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks driving a Vanwall.

=== Chief Mechanic&#x27;s Award ===
From 1948 until at least 1953, the chief mechanic of the winning car was awarded a prize. From 1948 the prize was the RAC Plaque, but by 1952 this had become a cash prize of £25.

=== Sir Arthur Stanley Cup ===
For the first British Grand Prix in 1926, Sir Arthur Stanley, president of the RAC from 1905 to 1936 presented a cup for the fastest lap of the race, which was won outright by Henry Segrave.

<text>The Basilica of Sacré Cœur de Montmartre (English: Sacred Heart of Montmartre), commonly known as Sacré-Cœur Basilica and often simply Sacré-Cœur (, pronounced ), is a Catholic church and minor basilica in Paris dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. It was formally approved as a national historic monument by the National Commission of Patrimony and Architecture on December 8, 2022.

Sacré-Cœur Basilica is located at the summit of the butte of Montmartre. From its dome two hundred meters above the Seine, the basilica overlooks the entire city of Paris and its suburbs. It is the second most popular tourist destination in the capital after the Eiffel Tower.

The basilica was first proposed by Felix Fournier, the Bishop of Nantes, in 1870 after the defeat of France and the capture of Napoleon III at the Battle of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian War. He attributed the defeat of France to the moral decline of the country since the French Revolution, and proposed a new Parisian church dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The edifice was proposed before the outbreak of the Paris Commune but since it was constructed at the highest point of the city, overlooking the site of the outbreak of the Commune and the rest of the city, it has remained controversial with politicians of the French left, for whom it symbolizes the repression of the Communards.

The basilica was designed by Paul Abadie, whose Neo-Byzantine-Romanesque plan was selected from among seventy-seven proposals. Construction began in 1875 and continued for forty years under five different architects. Completed in 1914, the basilica was formally consecrated in 1919 after World War I.

Sacré-Cœur Basilica has maintained perpetual adoration of the Holy Eucharist since 1885. The site is traditionally associated with the martyrdom of Saint Denis, the patron saint of Paris.

== History ==

=== Proposal ===
The proposal to build a new Parisian church dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus was first made on September 4, 1870, by Felix Fournier, the Bishop of Nantes, following the defeat of France and the capture of Emperor Napoleon III by the Prussians at the Battle of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian War. Until his death in 1877, Fournier was an active builder who completed the long-delayed restoration of Nantes Cathedral. He wrote that the defeat of France in 1870 was a divine punishment for the moral decline of the country since the French Revolution.
In January 1871, Fournier was joined by the philanthropist Alexandre Legentil, who was a follower of Frédéric Ozanam, the founder of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. Legentil declared that France had been justly punished for its sins by the defeat of the French Army at Sedan and the imprisonment of the Pope in Italy by Italian nationalists. He wrote,

We recognize that we were guilty and justly punished. To make honourable amends for our sins, and to obtain the infinite mercy of the Sacred Heart of our Lord Jesus Christ and the pardon of our sins, as well as extraordinary aid which alone can delivery our sovereign Pontiff from captivity and reverse the misfortune of France, we promise to contribute to the erection in Paris of a sanctuary dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

The influence of Legentil led to a successful fundraising campaign based entirely on private contributions.

=== Site ===
Montmartre was selected as the site of the new basilica due to its prominent height and visibility from many parts of the city. and for its association with Saint Denis of Paris. Since the location included land belonging to the local government as well as private owners, the French parliament assisted in securing the site by declaring that the construction of the basilica was in the national interest. In July 1873, the proposal was finally brought forward and approved in the National Assembly with the official statement that &quot;it was necessary to efface by this work of expiation the crimes which have crowned our sorrows.&quot; The groundbreaking for the new church finally took place in 1875.

Apart from its physical attributes, Montmartre or the &quot;Hill of the Martyrs&quot; was also chosen for its association with the early Christian church. According to tradition, it was the place where the patron saint of Paris, Saint Denis of Paris, was beheaded by the Romans. His tomb became the site of the Basilica of Saint Denis, the traditional resting place for the kings of France until the French Revolution.

In addition, Montmartre was the birthplace of the Society of Jesus, one of the largest and most influential religious orders in the history of the Catholic Church. In 1534, Ignatius of Loyola and a few of his followers made their vows in Saint-Pierre de Montmartre, one of the oldest churches in Paris. The church survived the Revolution although the Montmartre Abbey to which it belonged was destroyed.

=== Construction ===

A competition was held for the design of the basilica and attracted seventy-seven proposals. 
Architect Paul Abadie was selected, and the cornerstone finally laid on June 16, 1875.

The early construction was delayed and complicated by unstable foundations. Eighty-three wells, each thirty meters deep, had to be dug under the site and filled with rock and concrete to serve as subterranean pillars supporting the basilica. Construction costs, estimated at 7 million francs drawn entirely from private donors, were expended before any above-ground structure became visible. A provisional chapel was consecrated on March 3, 1876, and pilgrimage quickly brought in additional funding.

Not long after the foundation was completed in 1884, Abadie died and was succeeded by five other architects who made extensive modifications: Honoré Daumet (1884–1886), Jean-Charles Laisné (1886–1891), Henri-Pierre-Marie Rauline (1891–1904), Lucien Magne (1904–1916), and Jean-Louis Hulot (1916–1924).

During construction, opponents of the basilica were relentless in their effort to hinder its progress. In 1882, the walls of the church were barely above its foundations when the left-wing coalition led by Georges Clemenceau won the parliamentary election. Clemenceau immediately proposed halting the work, and the parliament blocked all further funding for the project. However, faced with enormous liabilities of twelve million francs from project cancellation, the government had to allow the construction to proceed.

In 1891, the interior of the basilica was completed, dedicated and opened for public worship. Still, in 1897, Clemenceau made another attempt to block its completion in the parliament, but his motion was overwhelmingly defeated since the cancellation of the project would require repaying thirty million francs to eight million people who had contributed to its construction.

The dome of the church was completed in 1899, and the bell tower finished in 1912. The basilica was completed in 1914 and formally dedicated in 1919 after World War I.

=== Controversy over the church ===

Criticism of the church by leftist journalists and politicians for its alleged connection with the destruction of the Paris Commune continued from the late 19th century into the 20th and 21st centuries, even though the church had been proposed before the Paris Commune took place. In 1898, Emile Zola wrote sarcastically,

France is guilty. It must do penitence. Penitence for what? For the Revolution, for a century of free speech and science, and emancipated reason... for that they built this gigantic landmark that Paris can see from all of its streets, and cannot be seen without feeling misunderstood and injured.

Shortly after the completed Statue of Liberty was transported from France to the United States, opponents of Sacré-Cœur came up with a new strategy. They proposed installing a full-size copy of the Statue of Liberty on top of Montmartre, directly in front of the basilica, which would entirely block the view of the church. This idea was eventually dropped as expensive and impractical.

A bomb was exploded inside the church in 1976.

To make their feelings about the church clear, in 2004 the socialist mayor of Paris Bertrand Delanoë and the mayor of the 18th arrondissement Daniel Vaillant, also member of the Socialist Party, renamed the square in front of and below the church in honor of Louise Michel, the prominent anarchist and participant in the Paris Commune.

Lionel Jospin, socialist Prime Minister between 1997 and 2002 also expressed his wish that the basilica be demolished as a symbol of &quot;obscurantism, bad taste and reactionism.&quot;

In 2021, to avoid celebrating the church&#x27;s history in the same year as the 150th anniversary of the Paris Commune, leftist members of the French parliament blocked a measure to declare the church a national historic monument and postponed it until 2022.

The church was finally named as a national historic monument by a unanimous vote of the National Commission of Patrimony and Architecture on December 8, 2022. This decision was immediately attacked by the leftist politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who called it &quot;a glorification of the assassination of 32,000 Paris Communards shot in just 8 days&quot;.

== Description ==
The church is 85 meters long and thirty-five meters wide. It is composed of a large central rotunda, around which are placed a small nave, two transepts, and an advance-choir, which form a cross. The porch of the church has three bays, and is modelled after the porch of Périgueux Cathedral. The dominant feature is the immense elongated ovoid cupola, 83.33 meters high, surrounded by four smaller cupolas. At the north end is the campanile, or bell tower, 84 meters high, containing the &quot;Savoyarde&quot;, the largest bell in France.

The overall style of the structure is a free interpretation of Romano-Byzantine architecture. This was an unusual architectural style at the time, and was in part a reaction against the neo-Baroque of the Palais Garnier opera house by Charles Garnier, and other buildings of the Napoleon III style. The construction was eventually handed on to a series of new architects, including Garnier himself, who was a counsellor to the architect Henri-Pierre Rauline between 1891 and 1904,

Some elements of the design, particularly the elongated domes and the structural forms of the windows on the south façade, are Neo-classical, and were added by the later architects Henri-Pierre Rauline and Lucien Magne.

=== Exterior ===

The campanile, or bell tower, on the north front, houses the nineteen-ton &quot;Savoyarde&quot; bell (one of the world&#x27;s heaviest), cast in 1895 in Annecy. It alludes to the attachment of Savoy to France in 1860.

The porch of the south façade, the main entrance, is loaded with sculpture combining religious and French national themes. It is topped with a statue representing the Sacred Heart of Christ. The arches of the façade are decorated with two equestrian statues of French national saints Joan of Arc (1927) and King Saint Louis IX, both executed in bronze by Hippolyte Lefèbvre.
The white stone of Sacré-Cœur is travertine limestone of a type called Chateau-Landon, quarried in Souppes-sur-Loing, in Seine-et-Marne, France. The particular quality of this stone is that it is extremely hard with a fine grain, and exudes calcite on contact with rainwater, making it exceptionally white.

=== Interior ===

The nave is dominated by the very high dome, which symbolises the celestial world, resting upon a rectangular space,symbolising the terrestrial world. The two are joined by massive columns, which represent the passage between the two worlds.

The plan of the interior is a Greek cross, with the altar in the center, modelled after Byzantine churches. More traditional Latin features, the choir and the disambulatory, were added around the altar. The light in interior of the church is unusually dim, due to the height of the windows above the altar, and this contributes to the mystical effect. Other Byzantine features in the interior include the designs of the tile floor and the glasswork.

==== &quot;The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus&quot; mosaic ====
The mosaic over the choir, entitled &quot;The Triumph of the Sacred Heart of Jesus&quot;, is the largest and most important work of art in the church. It was created by Luc-Olivier Merson, H. M. Magne and R. Martin, and was dedicated in 1923. The mosaic is composed of 25,000 enamelled and gilded pieces of ceramic, and covers 475 square meters, making it one of the largest mosaics in the world.

The central figure is Jesus Christ, dressed in white, with open arms offering his heart, decorated with gold. He is joined by his mother, the Virgin Mary, and by the Archangel Michael, the protector of the church and of France. At his feet, kneeling, is Saint Joan of Arc offering him a crown. A figure of Pope Leo XIII offers a globe to Christ, symbolising the world.

To the right of Christ is a scene titled &quot;The Homage of France to the Sacred Heart;&quot; a group of popes and cardinals present a model of the basilica to Christ. On his left is &quot;The Homage of the Catholic Church to the Sacred Heart&quot;: where people in the costumes of the five continents pay their homage to the Sacred Heart. At the base of the mosaic is a Latin inscription, stating that the basilica is a gift from France. &quot;To the Sacred Heart of Jesus, France fervent, penitent and grateful.&quot; The word &quot;grateful&quot; was added after World War I.

At the top of the mosaic is another procession, called &quot;the Saints of France and Saints of the Universal Church&quot;. In all of the mosaic, the artists adapted elements of Byzantine art in the organization of the figures, the altered perspective, and the use of polychrome colors enhanced with silver and gold.

The basilica complex also includes a garden for meditation, with a fountain. The top of the dome is open to tourists and affords a spectacular panoramic view of the city of Paris, which spreads out to the south of the basilica.

The use of cameras and video recorders is forbidden inside the basilica.

==== Chapels ====
The interior of the basilica is surrounded by a series of chapels, mostly offered by professional groups or religious orders. The chapels are decreed with sculpture, relief sculpture, and tapestries, often relating to the professions of the donors. For example, the Chapel of the Order of Notre Dame of the Sea is decorated with tapestries illustrating Christ walking on the water and the Miraculous Catch of fish. Beginning to the right of the main entrance, they are: 
* The Chapel of the Archangel Michael, or Chapel of the Armies
* The Chapel of Saint Louis (Louis IX) or the Attorneys
* The Tribune of Commerce and Industry (end of the East transept)
* The Chapel of Marguerite-Marie Alacoque
* the Chapel of Notre Dame of the Sea

The apse itself is ringed by an additional seven chapels.
* The Chapel of Saint Francis of Assisi
* The Chapel of Saint John the Baptist, offered by Canada and the Knights of Malta
* The Chapel of Saint Joseph
* The Chapel of the Virgin Mary
* The Chapel of Saint Luke the Evangelist, Comé and Damien, or the Doctors
* The Chapel of Ignace de Loyola
* Th Chapel of Saint Ursula of Cologne
* The Chapel of Saint Vincent de Paul
* The Tribune of Agriculture (at the end of the west transept)
* The chapel of the Queens of France

==== Crypt ====

The crypt below Sacré-Cœur is different from traditional crypts, which are usually underground. At Sacré-Cœur, the crypt has stained glass windows, thanks to a &quot;saut-de-loup&quot;, a trench about four meters wide around it, which allows light to enter through windows and oculi of the crypt wall. In the centre of the crypt is the chapel of the Pieta, whose central element is a monument statue of the Virgin Mary at the foot of the cross, at the altar. The statue was made by Jules Coutain in 1895. A series of seven chapels is placed on the east side and seven on the west side of crypt, corresponding to the chapels on the level above. The crypt contains the tombs of important figures in the creation of the basilica, including Cardinals Guibert and Richard.

=== Art and decoration ===
Decoration covers the walls, the floor, and the architecture. Much of the decoration is in a distinctly neo-Byzantine style, with intricate patterns, and abundant color.

=== Grand organ ===

The basilica contains a large and very fine pipe organ built by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, the most celebrated organ builder in Paris in the 19th century. His other organs included those of Saint-Denis Basilica (1841), Sainte-Clotilde Basilica (1859), Saint-Sulpice church and Notre Dame de Paris (1868). The organ is composed of 109 ranks and 78 speaking stops spread across four 61-note manuals and the 32-note pedalboard (unusual before the start of the 20th century; the standard of the day was 56 and 30), and has three expressive divisions (also unusual for the time, even in large organs).

The organ was originally built in 1898 for the Biarritz chateau of the Baron Albert de L&#x27;Espée. It was the last instrument built by Cavaillé-Coll. The organ was ahead of its time, containing multiple expressive divisions and giving the performer considerable advantages over other even larger instruments of the day. It was almost identical (tonal characteristics, layout, and casework) to the instrument in Sheffield&#x27;s Albert Hall, which was destroyed by fire in 1937. However, when installed in Paris in 1905 by Cavaillé-Coll&#x27;s successor and son-in-law, Charles Mutin, a much plainer case was substituted for the original ornate case.

The organ was recognised as a national landmark in 1981. It has undergone several restorations. The most recent, begun in 1985, replaced only the most severely damaged pneumatic parts, but others have deteriorated and some are no longer usable. The pipes are now covered with a thick layer of dust which impacts the pitch and timbre. Both the organ and the church itself have been recognized as national landmarks.

=== Bells ===
The belfry of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Montmartre houses five bells. The four small bells named from largest to smallest are Félicité, Louise, Nicole and Elisabeth, which were the original bells of the church of Saint-Roch and moved to the basilica in 1969.

Below the four bells is a huge bourdon called &quot;The Savoyarde&quot;, the biggest bell in France. The full name of the bourdon is “Françoise Marguerite of the Sacred Heart of Jesus&quot;. It was cast on May 13, 1891, by the Paccard foundry (Dynasty of Georges, Hippolyte-Francisque and Victor or &quot;G &amp; F&quot;) in Annecy-le-Vieux.

The Savoyarde itself only rings for major religious holidays, especially on the occasion of Easter, Pentecost, Ascension, Christmas, Assumption and All Saints. One exception was on the night of August 24, 1944 when &quot;La Nueve&quot; – 9th Company, Régiment de marche du Tchad of the French 2nd Armored Division – broke into Paris and arrived at the Hôtel de Ville during the Liberation of Paris from Nazi German occupation, becoming the first French Army troops to return to the city since 1940. The bell then rang when Pierre Schaeffer broadcast the news on a Radiodiffusion Nationale broadcast and then, after a playing of &quot;La Marsellaise&quot;, asked any priests who were listening to ring their churches&#x27; bells. The Savoyarde can be heard from 10 km away.

This bell is the fifth largest in Europe, ranking behind the &quot;Petersglocke&quot; of Cologne (Germany), the Olympic Bell of London, &quot;Maria Dolens&quot; of Rovereto (Italy), and the &quot;Pummerin&quot; of Vienna (Austria). It weighs 18,835 kg, measures 3,03 m of diameter for 9.60 m of outer circumference, with a base thickness of 22 cm and a leaf of 850 kg. With its accessories, its official weight reaches 19,685 kg. It was offered by the four dioceses of Savoy. It was transported to the basilica on October 16, 1895, pulled by a team of 28 horses. In the late 1990s, a crack was noticed in the bell.

== Role in Catholicism ==
The church is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which was an increasingly popular devotion after the visions of Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque (1647–1690) in Paray-le-Monial. In response to requests from French bishops, Pope Pius IX promulgated the feast of the Sacred Heart in 1856. The basilica itself was consecrated on 16 October 1919.

Since 1885 (before construction had been completed) the Blessed Sacrament (Christ&#x27;s body, consecrated during the Mass) has been continually on display in a monstrance above the high altar. Perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament has continued uninterrupted in the basilica since 1885.

Christian de Chergé, one of the killed monks of Tibherine, was chaplain at the basilica in the years 1964–1969.

Tourists and others are asked to dress appropriately when visiting the basilica and to observe silence as much as possible, so as not to disturb persons who have come from around the world to pray in this place of pilgrimage, especially since the Blessed Sacrament is displayed. Photos are not allowed to be taken in the basilica.

== Access ==
The basilica is accessible by bus or metro line 2 at Anvers station. Sacré-Cœur is open from 06:00 to 22:30 every day. The dome is accessible from 09:00 to 19:00 in the summer and to 18:00 in the winter.

== Copy in Martinique ==
A much smaller version of the basilica, Sacré-Cœur de la Balata, is located north of Fort-de-France, Martinique, on N3, the main inland road. Built for the refugees driven from their homes by the eruption of Mount Pelée, it was dedicated in 1915.

==Early life==
Wilson was born in Dallas, the middle child of three sons of photographer Laura Cunningham Wilson (b. 1939) and Robert Andrew Wilson (1941–2017), an advertising executive and operator of a public television station. His brothers Andrew and Luke are also actors. Wilson&#x27;s parents are of Irish descent. As a teenager, Wilson broke his nose twice: the first time in a high school fight, and the second time playing football with friends. “You know, probably my nose wouldn’t have been that great even if it hadn’t been broken,&quot; Wilson told &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;. 

After getting expelled for cheating in geometry, he attended New Mexico Military Institute. He later attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, but did not graduate. While in college, he met and was roommates with director and frequent collaborator Wes Anderson.

== Career ==
=== 1994–1999: Early films and breakthrough ===
Wilson made his film debut acting in the Wes Anderson short film &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; (1994) which was later expanded into the feature-length film &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; (1996) which Wilson co-wrote with Anderson. Wilson also acted opposite his brother Luke Wilson. David Hunter of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised the film describing it as, &quot;A marvelous debut film for its director, writer and lead actors, &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; is propelled by a fresh approach to the caper genre&quot;. That same year, he had a supporting role in the black comedy &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (1996) starring Jim Carrey and directed by Ben Stiller, an early admirer of Bottle Rocket. Wilson played Leslie Mann&#x27;s date in the film. In 1997, he had a role in the adventure thriller &quot;Anaconda&quot; and executive produced the James L. Brooks comedy &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;.

In 1998, Wilson had roles in the science fiction disaster film &quot;Armageddon&quot; and the independent drama film &quot;Permanent Midnight&quot;. He also reunited with Anderson co-writing the script for Anderson&#x27;s next two directorial films, &quot;Rushmore&quot; and &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, for which they garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. While Wilson did not act in &quot;Rushmore&quot;, he appears briefly in a photograph in the film. After appearing in supporting roles in 1999, he acted in horror film &quot;The Haunting&quot;, &quot;The Minus Man&quot;, in which his future girlfriend, singer Sheryl Crow, was a co-star.

=== 2000–2006: Film stardom ===

Wilson starred in the 2000 comedy action film &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot; alongside Jackie Chan. The film grossed nearly $100 million worldwide. His fame continued to rise after starring alongside Ben Stiller and Will Ferrell in the 2001 film &quot;Zoolander&quot;. Gene Hackman reportedly took notice of Wilson&#x27;s performance in &quot;Shanghai Noon&quot; and recommended the actor to co-star in the 2001 action film &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot;. Also in 2001, Wilson and Anderson collaborated on their third film, &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, a financial and critical success. The film earned the writing team an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.

Wilson returned to the buddy-comedy genre in 2002 with the action comedy &quot;I Spy&quot;, co-starring Eddie Murphy. The big-screen remake of the same-named television series did not perform well at the box office. He made a cameo appearance in the Girl Skateboards video &quot;Yeah Right!&quot; in 2003. He then reunited with Chan to make &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot; (2003), and co-starred in the film remake of the 1970s television series &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; (2004). Due to his busy schedule as an actor and an ongoing sinus condition, Wilson was unavailable to collaborate on the script for Wes Anderson&#x27;s fourth feature film, &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;. The 2004 film was ultimately co-written by filmmaker Noah Baumbach. However, Wilson did star in the film as Bill Murray&#x27;s would-be son, Ned Plimpton; it was a role written specifically for him. In 2004, he and his brother Luke played the Wright brothers in the 2004 film &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;. Wilson is said to be attached to a sequel to &quot;Shanghai Knights&quot;, marking his third collaboration with Jackie Chan.
Wilson partnered with Vince Vaughn in the 2005 comedy film &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;, which grossed over $200 million in the US alone. Also in 2005, Owen collaborated with his brothers in &quot;The Wendell Baker Story&quot;, written by Luke and directed by Luke and Andrew. In 2006, Wilson voiced Lightning McQueen in the Disney/Pixar film &quot;Cars&quot;, starred in &quot;You, Me and Dupree&quot; with Kate Hudson, and appeared with Stiller in &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; as cowboy Jedediah.

During this time, Wilson gained a reputation for frequently exclaiming &quot;Wow!&quot; in his roles, becoming something of a meme, as well as his trademark.

=== 2007–2015: Established career ===
Wilson appeared in another Wes Anderson film, &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot;, which screened at the 45th annual New York Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, and opened September 30, 2007. It co-stars Jason Schwartzman and Adrien Brody. &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; was selected for a DVD and Blu-ray release by The Criterion Collection in October 2010. Wilson next starred in the Judd Apatow comedy, &quot;Drillbit Taylor&quot; which was released in March 2008. He appeared in a film adaptation of John Grogan&#x27;s best-selling memoir, &quot;Marley &amp; Me&quot; (2008), co-starring Jennifer Aniston. He provided the voice for the Whackbat Coach Skip in Wes Anderson&#x27;s stop motion animated film &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; (2009). Wilson is a member of the comedic acting brotherhood colloquially known as the Frat Pack. Wilson made a guest appearance on the NBC comedy &quot;Community&quot; with fellow Frat Pack member Jack Black.
In 2011, Wilson starred as a nostalgia-seized writer in the romantic comedy &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;, written and directed by Woody Allen. The film premiered at the 64th Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim. The film became Allen&#x27;s highest grossing thus far, and was also well received by critics. Roger Ebert wrote of Wilson&#x27;s performance, &quot;[He] is a key to the movie&#x27;s appeal&quot;. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; also praised Wilson, writing &quot;Wilson makes the role endearingly his own&quot;. For his performance, Wilson earned a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

That same year, he starred in the film &quot;The Big Year&quot; (2011) an adaptation of Mark Obmascik&#x27;s book &quot;The Big Year: A Tale of Man, Nature and Fowl Obsession&quot;. The film was released in October 2011 by 20th Century Fox, and co-starred Jack Black, JoBeth Williams, Steve Martin and Rashida Jones. The same year, Wilson returned to voice McQueen in &quot;Cars 2&quot;. In March 2012, Wilson was signed to star in the John Erick Dowdle thriller &quot;The Coup&quot;, later renamed &quot;No Escape&quot;, in which he played the role of the father of an American family that moves to Southeast Asia, only to find itself swept up in a wave of rebel violence that is overwhelming the city. The film was not released until 2015, and was Wilson&#x27;s return to the action genre for the first time since &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; in 2001. He also voiced turkey Reggie in Reel FX&#x27;s first animated film, &quot;Free Birds&quot;.

In 2014, Wilson appeared in Wes Anderson&#x27;s acclaimed ensemble comedy &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; and in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s book adaptation of &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;. In 2015, he starred with Jennifer Aniston in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s film &quot;She&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot;, and in the action thriller film &quot;No Escape&quot; alongside Lake Bell and Pierce Brosnan. Wilson&#x27;s films have grossed more than 2.25 billion domestically (United States and Canada), with an average of 75M per film.

=== 2017–present ===
In 2017, Wilson again voiced Lightning McQueen in &quot;Cars 3&quot;, played a suburban father in the drama &quot;Wonder&quot;, and co-starred with Ed Helms in the comedy &quot;Father Figures&quot;. In November 2017, Wilson became the face of a new £20 million advertising campaign for the UK sofa retailer Sofology. He returned to work with Sofology in 2019 for a second advertising campaign.

In 2021, Wilson starred in the comedy film &quot;Bliss&quot;, directed by Mike Cahill opposite Salma Hayek for Amazon Studios. In 2021, Wilson also reunited with Wes Anderson for &quot;The French Dispatch&quot;, which premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival. and &quot;Marry Me&quot; alongside Jennifer Lopez and directed by Kat Coiro for Universal Pictures.

Wilson is currently starring in the Marvel Cinematic Universe series &quot;Loki&quot; opposite Tom Hiddleston on Disney+ as Mobius M. Mobius, a role he reprised in the 2023 film &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot;. He also signed on to star in a new film adaptation of &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In August 2007, Wilson attempted suicide and was subsequently treated for depression at St. John&#x27;s Health Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. A few days after his hospitalization, Wilson withdrew from his role in &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;. The incident resulted in much unwanted publicity for Wilson, and he became reluctant in doing interviews. In a 2021 interview with &quot;Esquire&quot;, Wilson briefly opened up about his suicide attempt, describing how his brothers supported him during his recovery.

In January 2011, Wilson and his then-girlfriend Jade Duell had a son. Wilson and Duell ended their relationship later that year. In January 2014, he had a son with Caroline Lindqvist. He had a third child, a daughter, in October 2018 with ex-girlfriend Varunie Vongsvirates.

<doc id="294263" wikidata="Q251054" url="?curid=294263" title="Carignan">
<text>Carignan (; also known as Mazuelo, Bovale Grande, Cariñena, Carinyena, Samsó, Carignane, and Carignano) is a red grape variety of Spanish origin that is more commonly found in French wine but is widely planted throughout the western Mediterranean and around the globe. Along with Aramon, it was considered one of the main grapes responsible for France&#x27;s wine lake and was a substantial producer in jug wine production in California&#x27;s Central Valley but in recent years, it has been reborn as a flagship wine for many cellars in the south of France as well as in Catalonia.

Ampelographers believe that the grape likely originated in Cariñena, Aragon and was later transplanted to Sardinia, elsewhere in Italy, France, Algeria, and much of the New World. The variety was historically a component of Rioja&#x27;s red wine blend. The grape&#x27;s prominence in France hit a high point in 1988 when it accounted for and was France&#x27;s most widely planted grape variety. That year, in a drive to increase the overall quality of European wine and to reduce the growing wine lake phenomenon, the European Union started an aggressive vine pull scheme where vineyard owners were offered cash subsidies in exchange for pulling up their vines. Out of all the French wine varieties, Carignan was the most widely affected dropping by 2000 to 95,700 ha (236,000 acres) and being surpassed by Merlot as the most widely planted grape.

The popularity of Carignan was largely tied to its ability to produce very large yields in the range of 200 hl/ha (11 tons/acre). The vine faces significant sensitivity to several viticultural hazards including rot, powdery mildew, downy mildew, and grape worms. Carignan is a late budding and ripening grape which requires a warm climate in order to achieve full physiological ripeness. The vine also develops very thick stalk around the grape clusters which makes mechanical harvesting difficult. It has an upright growth habit and can be grown without a trellis.

A white grape mutation known as &quot;Carignan blanc&quot; and a pink-berried &quot;Carignan gris&quot; also exists in Roussillon in small plantings of around and , respectively, reported in 2008.

==History==

Early Italian wine writers speculated that Carignan, known as Carignano in several parts of Italy, was a Phoenician wine grape variety that was brought to the island of Sardinia by the Phoenicians in the 9th century BC. From there the grape is believed to have spread to other Phoenician colonies, including the settlement at Sulcis, eventually being brought to the Italian mainland and carried around the western Mediterranean basin by the ancient Romans. Today, ampelographers largely discount this theory due to the lack of historical documentation or evidence from DNA analysis suggesting a Phoenician or Italian origin. Instead, the evidence points more strongly to a Spanish origin of the grape.

Ampelographers do believe that Carignan is likely a very old variety due to its widespread plantings and the proliferation of numerous different synonyms that give testament to the grape&#x27;s long history in different wine regions. The grape likely originated in the Aragon region of northeast Spain where it possibly named after the town of Cariñena in the province of Zaragoza. However, in Zaragoza and other parts of Catalonia, the grape is sometimes called &quot;Samsó&quot; which is also used as a synonym for the French wine grape Cinsault, adding to confusion over Carignan&#x27;s history in the region. Another Spanish synonym, Mazuelo, which is used in the Rioja wine region, is believed by ampelographers and wine historians to come from the commune of Mazuela in the province of Burgos in the Castile and León region of northwest Spain.

In 2006, DNA profiling suggested a parent-offspring relationship between Carignan and the Rioja wine grape Graciano though it was not yet clear which variety is the parent and which is the offspring. However, some grape geneticist and ampelographers such as José Vouillamoz dispute the 2006 findings and believe that the DNA profiles of both grapes are too distinct to have a close parent-offspring relationship at all. It is more likely, Vouillamoz and others suggest, that Carignan and Graciano were the result of two separate spontaneous crossings of unknown &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; parents that occurred somewhere in northeast Spain.

Carignan was likely introduced to Sardinia sometime between 1323 and 1720 when the island was under the Spanish influence of the Crown of Aragon. Here the grape developed in isolation to form distinct clones under the synonyms &quot;Bovale di Spagna&quot; and &quot;Bovale Grande&quot;. At some point the grape reached Algeria where it became a high yielding &quot;workhorse&quot; variety that was widely exported to France to add color and weight to French wine blends. After the phylloxera epidemic devastated French vineyards in the mid to late 19th century, plantings of Carignan grew in popularity on the French mainland. Plantings increased even more when Algeria gained independence in 1962. The grape&#x27;s prominence in France hit a high point in 1988 when it accounted for 167,000 hectares (410,000 acres) and was France&#x27;s most widely planted grape variety. However, as France&#x27;s wine lake problem became more of a concern, authorities within the French government and European Union started an aggressive vine pull scheme where vineyard owners were offered cash subsidies in exchange for pulling up their vines.

==Viticulture==

Carignan is a late budding and late ripening variety that is often one of the last grapes to be harvested during a vintage. The vine is very vigorous and high yielding, able to easily produce 200 hectoliters/hectare (approximately 10.4 tons/acres), if not kept in check by winter pruning or green harvesting during the growing season. The late ripening nature of the grape means that it rarely achieves full ripeness unless planted in vineyard soils in very warm climates such as the Mediterranean climates where the grape originated in or the hot Central Valley of California.

Carignan&#x27;s tendency to produce short shoots with clusters that grow closely to the trunk of the vine means that it is a difficult variety to harvest mechanically. However, the economy of scale for blending varieties or grapes destined for lower priced box and jug wines often do not work well with the expense and labor cost of hand-harvesting. Among the viticultural hazards that Carignan is susceptible to include powdery mildew and infestation of the vine from grape worms and the European Grapevine Moth. The vine has some slight resistance to the fungal disease of botrytis bunch rot, downy mildew, and phomopsis.

===Relationship and confusion with other grapes===

In 2003, DNA evidence confirmed that Carignan/Cariñena was the same variety as the Mazuelo (or Mazuela) grape of Rioja. This was followed by the discovery in 2007 that the Bovale di Spagna and Bovale Grande grapes of Sardinia were also identical to Carignan. DNA profiling was also able to distinguish Carignan as a distinct variety from other varieties known as Bovale (including Graciano which is known on Sardinia as Bovale Sardo and Bovale Cagnulari) as well as the Valencia wine grape Bobal which is sometimes field blended in the Cariñena (DO) with Carignan.

Other varieties sometimes confused with Carignan but have been conclusively proven by DNA analysis to be distinct include the Sardinian wine grape Nieddera that is related to the Pascale di Cagliari grape which also grown on the island, Cinsault which shares the synonym Samsó in Catalonia with Carignan, the Italian wine grape Tintilia del Molise that is grown in the Lazio and Molise wine regions of central Italy and the Spanish wine grape Parraleta that is grown in the Somontano DO of Aragon.

Grapes that are also unrelated to Carignan but share synonyms include Carignan Boushet (a Petit Bouschet and Morrastel cross), Bobal (a Spanish wine grape that is also known as Carignan d&#x27;Espagne), Aubun (a French wine grape that is also known as Carignan de Bedoin, Carignan de Bedouin, and Carignan de Gigondas), Alicante Bouschet (French teinturier grape that is also known as Carignan jaune), and Grenache (which is also known as Carignan rouge, Carignane rosso, and Carignane rousse).

Over the years Carignan has been crossed with several varieties to create new wine grapes including with Cabernet Sauvignon to give Ruby Cabernet and with the Portuguese wine grape Souzão to produce Argaman.

===Carignan blanc and gris===

Like Pinot noir and Grenache, Carignan has mutated to produce white-berried and pink-berried color mutations known as Carignan blanc and Carignan gris, respectively. Carignan blanc is a white mutation of the Carignan grape found primarily in the Roussillon region. First discovered in the early 20th century, there were of the grape planted in France in the 1960s but by 2009 that figure had dropped to . In Spain, Carignan blanc (known as Cariñena blanca throughout most of the country, Samsó blanco in Catalonia, and Carinyena blanc in the Empordà (DO)) is even more rarely found with only planted throughout the country in 2008. Here the grape is mostly used for blending with Macabeo, with a very few varietal examples produced.

Like Carignan noir, both Carignan blanc and Carignan gris are late budding and late ripening varieties that are highly susceptible to powdery mildew. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Carignan blanc tends to produce full-bodied white wines that can have high acid and alcohol levels with very little aromatics. While the wines tend to be &quot;shy&quot; in the nose, Robinson notes that the palate can be &quot;luscious&quot; with light, citrus notes.

==Winemaking==
In winemaking, the grape is often used as a deep coloring component in blends, rather than being made in a varietal form with some exceptions. Carignan can be a difficult variety for winemakers to work due to its naturally high acidity, tannins, and astringency which requires a lot of skill to produce a wine of finesse and elegance. Some winemakers have experimented with carbonic maceration and adding small amounts of Cinsault and Grenache with some positive results. Syrah and Grenache are considered its best blending partners being capable of yielding a softer wine with rustic fruit and perfume. In California, Ridge Vineyards has found some success with a varietal wine made from Carignan vines that were planted in the 1880s.

==Wine regions==
Carignan is found around the globe with the vast majority of plantings in France, followed by Spain and Italy where it is a permitted grape variety in several &quot;appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC), &quot;denominación de origen&quot; (DO) and &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) regions. Elsewhere in Europe and the Middle East, plantings of the grape can be found in Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, Turkey, and Israel. In Africa, plantings of Carignan are also found in the north African wine-producing countries of Morocco and Tunisia as well as in South Africa.

In the New World, Carignan is planted in several American Viticultural Areas (AVA)s of the United States, particularly in California and Washington State. Elsewhere in North America, plantings of the grape can be found in Mexico. In South America, Carignan is planted in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. In recent years, plantings of the grape have slowly increased in China as well as Australia.

===France===

Carignan is most widely found in southern France, particularly in the Languedoc wine regions of Aude, Gard, and Hérault where it is often made as &quot;Vin ordinaire&quot; and in some &quot;Vin de pays&quot; wines. In the late 1990s, there were over of the grape planted in the Aude and Hérault departments alone but by 2009 the total plantings of Carignan throughout France had dropped to . While plantings of the grape in France were more than 9 times higher than the next major Carignan producing country (Spain), this drop in plantings is indicative of the global trend of decline in &quot;workhorse varieties&quot; like Carignan in favor of what the European Union designates as &quot;improving varieties&quot; such as Grenache, Mourvedre, and Syrah.

Plantings of Carignan are mostly limited to the warm Mediterranean climates of southern France due to the grape&#x27;s inability to sufficiently ripen much further north in the continental climate of central France or in the damp maritime climate of Southwest France. Other departments with significant plantings of Carignan include the Pyrénées-Orientales, Var, and Vaucluse.

===Spain===

In 2004, Spain had around 7,000 ha (17,300 acres) of Carignan planted. By 2008 that number has dropped to around , and to in 2015. The grape (traditionally called Cariñena, but now officially called Mazuelo, but also spelled Mazuela) has seen plantings sharply decline in its ancestral home of Aragon where it was once a secondary component of wine from the &quot;denominación de origen protegida&quot; (DOP) of Cariñena region after Grenache. In 2009, Aragon has just dedicated to the grape.

The grape has found an increasing prominence in the Catalan wine region of Priorat, where it is the main variety in the schistous vineyard soils of the northern half of the appellation. Around the villages of Poboleda and Porrera in the province of Tarragona are bushvines of the grape that are more than 100 years old that are used to make varietal wines. The grape is also found in the DOPs of Costers del Segre, Montsant, Penedès, Tarragona, and Terra Alta. In Catalan the grape is called Samsó or Carinyena, though it is not related to Cinsault which is also known as Samsó in Catalonia.

Outside of Catalonia, Mazuelo is mostly a secondary blending variety used to add acidity to the Tempranillo-based wines of Rioja though a few producers, such as Marqués de Murrieta, do make varietal examples of the grape. In 2008, there were of the grape in Rioja. In 2009, there were and of Carignan planted in the nearby wine regions of Castile-La Mancha and Navarra respectively.

===Other Old World regions===

In 2012, more than 97% of Italy&#x27;s of Carignan plantings were in Sardinia with a few scattered plantings throughout Lazio, particularly the Cerveteri DOC, where it is often used in rosé winemaking. The Carignano del Sulcis &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) features a Carignan-based &quot;rosso&quot; from the Sardinian islands of Sant&#x27;Antioco and San Pietro. Here the grape is known as Bovale Grande and is also featured in the DOC wines of Campidano di Terralba and Mandrolisai.

The grape is still popular in North Africa in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. Carignan also played an important role in the early development of the Israeli wine industry. Though it is not as prominent today, it is still the country&#x27;s third most widely planted red grape variety after Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with in 2009. The first serious and consistent efforts to produce quality Carignan was at 2002 by Assaf Paz, the Bordeaux trained Enologist of Vitkin winery . His persistence to produce high quality old vine Carignan encourages other producers to follow and today Israel presents an impressive range of faire to excellent examples of this verity 

Other Old World wine producing countries with significant Carignan plantings include Croatia with in 2009, Cyprus with , Malta with and Turkey with in 2010. Chinese winemakers have also experimented with growing Carignan in some of their warmer wine regions.

===United States===

At one point in California&#x27;s wine history, Carignane (as it is known there) was the third most widely planted grape variety but has since dropped considerably in production. The majority of the vines were planted in the Central Valley and used to make inexpensive box and jug wines. In the 1970s and 1980s, Californian Carignane was one of the leading &quot;home winemaking&quot; grapes in production. In 2010, there were of the grape planted in the state with American Viticultural Areas in Contra Costa, Mendocino, and Sonoma counties seeing a slight increase in interest while plantings the Central Valley have declined.

Outside of California, plantings of the grape can be found in Washington State as well as in Missouri and Texas.

===Other New World regions===
In Mexico, plantings of Carignan are found in the states of Aguascalientes, Sonora, and Zacatecas. In Chile, old vines of plantings of Carignan are grown without irrigation in the Maule region which accounted for the majority of the country&#x27;s plantings of the grape in 2008. In Argentina there was just of the grape while Uruguay had planted in 2009.

In Australia the grape was often confused with the Bonvedro vine, which is similarly prone to diseases, but in recent years Australian winemakers have been able to identify true Carignan. Most Australian plantings of Carignan are found in South Australia where the grape is primarily used for blending. In South Africa, there were of the grape planted in 2012 with the majority found on the shale vineyard soils of the Paardeberg region in Swartland.

==Synonyms==

The grape is known under a variety of synonyms through the world. In Spanish it is known as Cariñena (particularly in Aragon), with Cariñano (also in Aragon), Mazuelo, Tinto Mazuelo, Crujillon (in Aragon) and Samsó (in Catalonia) also being used in Spain. The recent use of Samsó has been controversial because this seems to be an error, as there is a different grape called Samsó, which is France&#x27;s Cinsault but this change was implemented due to name Cariñena (in Catalan the grape is still generally called, &#x27;Carinyena&#x27;) being claimed by the DO body in Aragon.

In California it is spelled with an extra vowel on the end as Carignane. In Italy it is known as Gragnano while in Sardinia it is known as Bovale Grande and Carignano.

<doc id="294270" wikidata="Q202802" url="?curid=294270" title="Earl of Warwick">
<text>Earl of Warwick is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom which has been created four times in English history. The name refers to Warwick Castle and the town of Warwick.

==Overview==
The first creation came in 1088, and the title was held by the Beaumont and later by the Beauchamp families. The 14th earl was created Duke of Warwick in 1445, a title which became extinct on his early death the following year. The best-known earl of this creation was the 16th earl &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, Richard Neville, who was involved in the deposition of two kings, a fact which later earned him the epithet of &quot;Warwick the Kingmaker&quot;. This creation became extinct on the death of the 17th earl in 1499.

The title was revived in 1547 for the powerful statesman John Dudley, 1st Viscount Lisle, who was later made Duke of Northumberland. The earldom was passed on during his lifetime to his eldest son, John, but both father and son were attainted in 1554. The title was recreated or restored in 1561 in favour of Ambrose Dudley, younger son of the Duke of Northumberland. However, Ambrose was childless and the earldom became extinct on his death in 1590.

It was created for a third time in 1618 for Robert Rich, 3rd Baron Rich, in spite of the fact that the Rich family was not in possession of Warwick Castle. From 1673, the earls also held the title of Earl of Holland. All of the titles became extinct on the death of the 8th earl in 1759.

The earldom was revived the same year in favour of Francis Greville, 1st Earl Brooke. The Greville family was in possession of Warwick Castle, and the title and castle were thereby re-united for the first time in over a century. The 1759 creation is extant and currently held by Guy Greville, 9th Earl of Warwick. However, Warwick Castle was sold by the family in 1978, and they currently live in Australia.

==1088 creation==


The medieval earldom created in 1088 was held to be heritable via a female line of descent, and thus was held by members of several different families. It was traditionally associated in its feudal form with possession of Warwick Castle. The ancient heraldic device of the Earls of Warwick, the Bear and Ragged Staff, is believed to derive from two legendary Earls, Arthal and Morvidus. Arthal is thought to mean &quot;bear&quot;, while Morvidus was to have slain a giant &quot;with a young ash tree torn up by the roots.&quot; Alternatively the emblem of a bear (Latin &quot;ursus&quot;) is believed to refer to Urse d&#x27;Abetot ( 1040 – 1108), 1st feudal baron of Salwarpe in Worcestershire, a Norman who followed King William the Conqueror to England, and served as Sheriff of Worcestershire. His heir was his son-in-law Walter de Beauchamp (died 1130/3), whose descendant was William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick (–1298).

The first Earl of Warwick was Henry de Beaumont (d.1119), second son of Roger de Beaumont (d. circa 1094) by his wife Adeline de Meulan (/20–1081), daughter and heiress of Waleran III, Count of Meulan. Henry&#x27;s elder brother was Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, Count of Meulan, who fought at the Battle of Hastings with William the Conqueror. The family name of &quot;Beaumont&quot; was Latinised to &quot;de Bello Monte&quot; (&quot;from the beautiful mountain&quot;); the Warwick branch of the family was also known as &quot;de Newburgh&quot;, Latinised to &quot;de Novo Burgo&quot; (&quot;from the new borough/town&quot;). Henry changed his name to &quot;de Newburgh&quot;, after the Castle de Neubourg, his home in Normandy, an ancient Beaumont possession. Henry became Constable of Warwick Castle in 1068 and Earl of Warwick in 1088 as reward for his support for the king during the Rebellion of 1088.

The title passed through several generations of the Beaumont family until 1242 when Thomas de Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick died without male issue. The earldom then went to his sister, Margaret de Beaumont, 7th Countess of Warwick and her successive husbands &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, and on her death to her cousin William Mauduit, 8th Earl of Warwick. When he died also without a male heir, the title passed to his sister, Isabel de Mauduit, and her husband Lord William de Beauchamp (d.1268), and thence to her son William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. During this period the Earldom and the Beauchamps were elevated to the highest levels until Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick, 14th Earl of Warwick, was created Duke of Warwick with precedence over all except the Duke of Norfolk.

This precedence was disputed however and with Henry&#x27;s death in 1445, also without male issue, the dukedom was extinguished. The earldom went to his infant daughter, and on her death aged 5 a few years later passed to Henry&#x27;s sister Anne de Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick and her husband Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, who &quot;succeeded in right of his wife&quot; but was subsequently &quot;confirmed&quot; in that title on 23 July 1449 which confirmation he thereafter resigned and was definitively created Earl of Warwick by letters patent dated 2 March 1450, with his wife being similarly created Countess of Warwick. He is known to history as &quot;Warwick the Kingmaker&quot; and died without male issue in 1471, aged 42, when the Earldom fell into abeyance between his two daughters.

After Richard Neville&#x27;s death the title was passed through his eldest daughter Isabel Neville to her husband George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, brother of Kings Edward IV and Richard III, who on 25 March 1472 by letters patent was created Earl of Warwick (and Earl of Salisbury). Although he was so created, &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot; nevertheless terms him the 17th Earl of Warwick, which suggests perhaps that the creation was considered a mere formality and confirmation of his inheritance. He was attainted and executed in 1478 whereupon his titles became forfeited. His Earldom was forfeited and thus not able to be inherited by his son Edward Plantagenet, who did however manage to inherit it from his maternal grandmother Anne de Beauchamp (d.1492), wife of &quot;Warwick the Kingmaker&quot;, who had been created Countess of Warwick by letters patent in 1450, at the same time her husband was created Earl of Warwick. He thus became Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick, but on his beheading for treason in 1499 the title became forfeited.

==1547 creation==

The title was next conferred upon the powerful statesman and soldier John Dudley, 1st Viscount Lisle. He had already been created Viscount Lisle in right of his deceased mother, Elizabeth Grey, in 1543, and was made Earl of Warwick in the Peerage of England in 1547. In 1551 he was further honoured when he was created Duke of Northumberland. In January 1553 Parliament passed the earldom to his eldest son John, the second Earl. He died young in 1554, and having been attainted along with his father in August 1553, the title became extinct until it was revived in 1561 for his younger brother Ambrose, the third Earl. He served as Master-General of the Ordnance and Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. On his death in 1590 the earldom became extinct.

==1618 creation==

The title was re-created when Robert Rich, 3rd Baron Rich, was made Earl of Warwick in 1618. This was despite the fact that the Rich family were not in possession of Warwick Castle (this was in the hands of the Greville family; see the 1759 creation below). His second son Henry Rich was created Baron Kensington in 1623 and Earl of Holland in 1624. Lord Warwick was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented Maldon in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Essex.

His eldest son, the third Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Essex. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He represented Sandwich and Essex in Parliament. On his death the line of the second Earl of Warwick failed and the titles were inherited by his first cousin Robert Rich, 2nd Earl Holland, who became the fifth Earl of Warwick as well. He was the son of the aforementioned Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland, younger son of the first Earl of Warwick (see the Earl of Holland for earlier history of this branch of the family). This line of the family failed on the early death of his grandson, the seventh Earl, in 1721. The late Earl was succeeded by his second cousin Edward Rich, the eighth Earl. He was the grandson of Cope Rich, younger son of the first Earl of Holland. On his death in 1759 all the titles became extinct.

Lady Mary Rich, daughter of the first Earl of Holland, married Sir John Campbell, 5th Baronet, who was created Earl of Breadalbane and Holland in 1681. Also, Lady Elizabeth Rich, only daughter and heiress of the fifth Earl of Warwick and second Earl of Holland, married Francis Edwardes. Their son William Edwardes succeeded to parts of the Rich estates and was created Baron Kensington in the Peerage of Ireland in 1776, a revival of the barony attached to the earldom of Holland.

Charles Rich, son of Sir Edward Rich, younger son of the second Baron Rich, was created a baronet in 1676 (see Rich baronets).

==1759 creation==

The title was again created in 1759 when Francis Greville, 8th Baron Brooke was made Earl of Warwick in the Peerage of Great Britain. In 1746 he had been created Earl Brooke, of Warwick Castle in the County of Warwick, in the Peerage of Great Britain. The earldom and Warwick Castle were thereby re-united for the first time in over a century. In 1767 the Earl petitioned the House of Lords for permission to use just the more prestigious title and style of &quot;Earl of Warwick&quot; only, with the precedence of 1746. Such permission was never granted but the Earls nevertheless ceased to use the Brooke earldom in style, and have always been known (except in the House of Lords) simply as the Earl of Warwick.

The first Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented Warwick in Parliament and served as a Lord of Trade and as Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. His eldest son from his second marriage, the third Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Warwick and held minor office in the second administration of Sir Robert Peel. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He represented Warwickshire South in the House of Commons. His eldest son, the fifth Earl, was Conservative Member of Parliament for Somerset East and served as Lord Lieutenant of Essex. As of 2018, the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the ninth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1996.

<doc id="294271" wikidata="Q34219" url="?curid=294271" title="Walloon language">
<text>Walloon (; natively ; ) is a Romance language that is spoken in much of Wallonia and, to a very small extent, in Brussels, Belgium; some villages near Givet, northern France; and a clutch of communities in northeastern Wisconsin, United States. 

It belongs to the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; dialect continuum, the most prominent member of which is French. The historical background of its formation was the territorial extension since 980 of the Principality of Liège to the south and west. Walloon is classified as &quot;definitely endangered&quot; by the UNESCO &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot;.

Despite its rich literature, beginning anonymously in the 16th century and with well-known authors since 1756, the use of Walloon has decreased markedly since France&#x27;s annexation of Wallonia in 1794. This period definitively established French as the language of social promotion, far more than it was before. After World War I, public schools provided French-speaking education to all children, inducing a denigration of Walloon, especially when accompanied by official orders in 1952 to punish its use in schools. Subsequently, since the middle of the 20th century, generational transmission of the language has decreased, resulting in Walloon almost becoming a dead language. Today it is scarcely spoken among younger people, with the vast majority of its native speakers being the elderly (aged 65 and over). In 2007, the number of people with knowledge of the language was estimated at 600,000.

Numerous associations, especially theatre companies, are working to keep the language alive. Formally recognized as a &quot;&quot; (regional indigenous language) of Belgium since 1990, Walloon has also benefited from a continued corpus planning process. The &quot;Feller system&quot; (1900) regularized transcription of the different accents. Since the 1990s, a common orthography was established (the ), which allowed large-scale publications, such as the &quot;Walloon Wikipedia&quot; officially in 2003. In 2004, a Walloon translation of a &quot;Tintin&quot; comic was released under the name &quot;L&#x27;èmerôde d&#x27;al Castafiore&quot;; in 2007 an album consisting of Gaston Lagaffe comic strips was published in Walloon.

Walloon is more distinct as a language than Belgian French, which differs from the French spoken in France only in some minor points of vocabulary and pronunciation.

== Disputed nature of Walloon ==

Linguists had long classified Walloon as a dialect of French, which in turn is a &quot;. Like French, it descended from Vulgar Latin. Arguing that a French-speaking person could not understand Walloon easily, especially in its eastern forms, Jules Feller (1859–1940) insisted that Walloon had an original &quot;superior unity&quot;, which made it a language.

The phonological divisions of regional languages of southern Belgium were studied by the contemporary linguist E.B. Atwood. He defined the precise geographical repartition of the four chief dialects of Walloon. In addition, he defined them against the dialects of Picard, Lorrain and Champenois.

Since then, most linguists (among them Louis Remacle), and gradually also Walloon politicians, regard Walloon as a regional language, the first in importance in Wallonia. It is the only one to have originated from that part of Belgium. The eleventh edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; identified Walloon as the &quot;northernmost Romance language&quot;.

==Geographic distribution==
===Walloon===
Walloon is spoken in the Wallonia Region in Belgium. In addition, it is spoken in:
* a small part of France: the &quot;Pointe de Givet&quot; in northern Ardennes, and several villages in the Nord &quot;département&quot;, making it one of the regional languages of France;
* a small district of Door County, Wisconsin, US, owing to fairly large-scale immigration there in the 19th century; as well as portions of Kewaunee County, Wisconsin, US, and Brown County, Wisconsin, US; and
* Brussels, by some Walloon residents.

Although Walloon was widely spoken until the mid-20th century, today only a small proportion of the inhabitants of the region are fluent in the language. Those born since the 1970s usually know little more than a few idiomatic expressions, often profanities. The Walloon language is still part of the Walloon heritage; it is one component of Walloon identity.

===Dialects===
Four dialects of Walloon developed in four distinct zones of Wallonia:
* Central, spoken in Namur (&#x27;), the Wallon capital, and the cities of Wavre (&#x27;) and Dinant;
* Eastern – in many respects the most conservative and idiosyncratic of the dialects, spoken in Liège (&#x27;), Verviers (&#x27;), Malmedy (&#x27;), Huy (&#x27;), and Waremme (&quot;);
* Western – the dialect closest to French proper and with a strong Picard influence, spoken in Charleroi (&#x27;), Nivelles (&#x27;), and Philippeville (&quot;); and
* Southern – close to the Lorrain and to a lesser extent Champenois languages, spoken in Bastogne, Marche-en-Famenne (&#x27;), and Neufchâteau (&#x27;), all in the Ardennes region.

Despite local phonetic differences, there is a regional movement towards the adoption of a common spelling, called the Rifondou walon. This orthography is diasystemic, reflecting different pronunciations for different readers, a concept inspired by the spelling of Breton. The written forms attempt to reconcile current phonetic uses with ancient traditions (notably the reintroduction of &quot;xh&quot; and &quot;oi&quot; that were used for writing Walloon until the late 19th century) and the language&#x27;s own phonological logic.

===Other regional languages===
Other regional languages spoken in Wallonia, outside the Walloon domain, are:
* Picard, in Mons, Ath, and Tournai;
* Lorrain (also called &quot;Gaumais&quot; locally), in Virton;
* Champenois, in Bohan; and
* Luxembourgish, in Arlon and Martelange.

The Picard, Lorrain and Champenois dialects spoken in Wallonia are sometimes also referred to as &quot;Walloon&quot;, which may lead to confusion.

== Phonetics and phonology ==
* may also be heard as or in word-final positions.

* may also be pronounced as an alveolar trill among speakers.

* can have an allophone of .

* Latin before and before , , or gave Walloon affricate phonemes spelled &quot;tch&quot; and &quot;dj&quot; : (vs. French &quot;cow&quot;), ( &quot;leg&quot;).
* Latin persisted in clusters: (Fr. &quot;thorn, spine&quot;), &quot;wisp of straw&quot;, (Fr. &quot;master&quot;), (Fr. &quot;party, feast&quot;), (Fr. &quot;castle&quot;), and so on.
* Final obstruent devoicing: &quot;red&quot; is pronounced exactly as &quot;rock&quot;.
* Nasal vowels may be followed by nasal consonants, as in &quot;young&quot;, &quot;cream&quot;, &quot;dirty&quot;, etc.
* Vowel length has a phonological value. It allows distinguishing &quot;arse&quot; and &quot;cooked&quot;, &quot;he cradles her&quot; and &quot;he increases it&quot;, &quot;mass&quot; and &quot;master&quot;, etc.

== Orthography ==

The Walloon alphabet generally consists of the basic ISO Latin Alphabet, and six types of diacritic. It also makes frequent use of digraphs. Various orthographies have been used, most notably the Feller system () and Unified Walloon ( or ).

==Characteristics==
===Language family===
Walloon is distinguished from other languages in the &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; family both by archaism coming from Latin and by its significant borrowing from Germanic languages, as expressed in its phonetics, its lexicon, and its grammar. At the same time, Walloon phonetics are singularly conservative: the language has stayed fairly close to the form it took during the High Middle Ages.

=== Morphology ===
* The plural feminine adjectives before the noun take an unstressed ending (except in the Ardenne dialect): compare &quot;the yellow leaf&quot; and &quot;the yellow leaves&quot;.
* There is no gender difference in definite articles and possessives (except in the Ardenne dialect): compare Walloon (&quot;the car&quot;, feminine) and (&quot;the sky&quot;, masculine), with French and ; Walloon has (&quot;his/her body&quot;, masculine) and (&quot;his/her window&quot;, feminine) with French and .

=== Lexicon ===
* Walloon has a few Latin remnants that have disappeared from neighboring Romance languages: compare Walloon to Spanish and Romanian (all with the same meaning: &quot;to awaken&quot;).
* The most distinctive feature is its number of borrowings from Germanic languages (Dutch and German dialects): compare Walloon to today&#x27;s Dutch &quot;weak&quot; (cognate of English &quot;flaw&quot;). Other common borrowings, among hundreds of others, are (&quot;tip&quot;; Dutch ), (&quot;curl&quot;; Dutch ), (&quot;to spatter&quot;; same root as the English &quot;to spit&quot;, and &quot;to spew&quot;, or German ; Dutch ), (the starling; Dutch , or German ).

=== Syntax ===
* The adjective is often placed before the noun: compare Walloon with French , &quot;a strong man&quot;; and French , &quot;a white house&quot;.
* Borrowing from Germanic languages, the construction &quot;What kind of flower is this?&quot; can be compared word for word to German and Dutch , as opposed to Standard French or (colloquially) .

==History==
From a linguistic point of view, Louis Remacle has shown that a good number of the developments that we now consider typical of Walloon appeared between the 8th and 12th centuries. Walloon &quot;had a clearly defined identity from the beginning of the 13th century&quot;. In any case, linguistic texts from the time do not mention the language, although they mention others in the &quot;langue d&#x27;oïl&quot; family, such as Picard and Lorrain. During the 15th century, scribes in the region called the language &quot;Roman&quot; when they needed to distinguish it. It is not until the beginning of the 16th century that first occurrence of the word &quot;Walloon&quot; appeared in the current linguistic sense. In 1510 or 1511, Jean Lemaire de Belges made the connection between &#x27; to &#x27;:

The word &quot;Walloon&quot; thus came closer to its current meaning: the vernacular of the Roman part of the Low Countries. One might say that the period which saw the establishment of the unifying supremacy of the Burgundians in the Walloon country was a turning-point in their linguistic history. The crystallization of a Walloon identity, as opposed to that of the &quot;&quot; (i.e. Dutch-speaking) regions of the Low Countries, established &quot;Walloon&quot; as a word for designating its people. Somewhat later, the vernacular of these people became more clearly distinct from central French and other neighbouring &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot;, prompting the abandonment of the vague term &quot;Roman&quot; as a linguistic, ethnic, and political designator for &quot;Walloon&quot;.

Also at this time, following the Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts in 1539, the French language replaced Latin for all administrative purposes in France. Established as the academic language, French became the object of a political effort at normalization; &quot;&quot; posited the view that when two languages of the same language family coexist, each can be defined only in opposition to the other. Around the year 1600, the French writing system became dominant in the Wallonia. From this time, too, dates a tradition of texts written in a language marked by traces of spoken Walloon. The written language of the preceding centuries, &quot;scripta&quot;, was a composite language with some Walloon characteristics but it did not attempt to be a systematic reproduction of the spoken language.

==Walloon society and culture==
Walloon was the predominant language of the Walloon people until the beginning of the 20th century, although they had a passing knowledge of French. Since that time, the use of French has spread to the extent that now only 15% of the Walloon population speak their ancestral language. Breaking the statistics down by age, 70–80% of the population aged over 60 speak Walloon, while only about 10% of those under 30 do so. Passing knowledge of Walloon is much more widespread: claimed by some 36–58% of the younger age bracket. Laurent Hendschel estimates there are 1,300,000 bilingual people in Wallonia (Walloon-French, Picard-French...). Many French words that pertain to mining and to the textile trade derive from the Walloon-Picard complex.

Legally, Walloon has been recognized since 1990 by the French Community of Belgium, the cultural authority of Wallonia, as an &quot;indigenous regional language&quot; which must be studied in schools and encouraged. The Walloon cultural movement includes the &quot;Union Culturelle Wallonne&quot;, an organization of over 200 amateur theatre circles, writers&#x27; groups, and school councils. About a dozen Walloon magazines publish regularly. The &quot;&quot;, founded in 1856, promotes Walloon literature and the study (dialectology, etymology, etc.) of the regional Roman languages of Wallonia. There is a difference between the Walloon culture, according to the Manifesto for Walloon culture, and the Walloon language (even if the latter is a part of the culture). 

==Literature==

Walloon-language literature has been printed since the 16th century, or at least since the beginning of the 17th century. It had its &quot;golden age&quot; during the peak of the Flemish immigration to Wallonia in the 19th century: &quot;That period saw an efflorescence of Walloon literature, plays and poems primarily, and the founding of many theaters and periodicals.&quot;

The New York Public Library holds a large collection of literary works in Walloon, quite possibly the largest outside Belgium, and its holdings are representative of the output. Out of nearly a thousand works, twenty-six were published before 1880. Thereafter the numbers rise gradually year by year, reaching a peak of sixty-nine in 1903. After that, publications in Walloon fell markedly, to eleven in 1913. Yves Quairiaux counted 4,800 plays for 1860–1914, published or not. In this period, plays were almost the only popular entertainment in Wallonia. The Walloon-language theatre remains popular in the region; theatre is flourishing with more than 200 non-professional companies playing in the cities and villages of Wallonia for an audience of over 200,000 each year.

During the 19th-century renaissance of Walloon-language literature, several authors adapted versions of &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; to the racy speech (and subject matter) of Liège. They included Charles Duvivier (in 1842); Joseph Lamaye (1845); and the team of Jean-Joseph Dehin (1847, 1851–1852) and François Bailleux (1851–1866), who covered books I-VI. Adaptations into other dialects were made by Charles Letellier (Mons, 1842) and Charles Wérotte (Namur, 1844). Decades later, Léon Bernus published some hundred imitations of La Fontaine in the dialect of &quot;Charleroi&quot; (1872); he was followed during the 1880s by Joseph Dufrane, writing in the &quot;Borinage&quot; dialect under the pen-name &quot;Bosquètia&quot;. In the 20th century, Joseph Houziaux (1946) published a selection of 50 fables in the &quot;Condroz&quot; dialect. The motive among Walloon speakers in both France and Belgium was to assert regional identity against the growing centralism and encroachment of the language of the capital, on what had until then been predominantly monoglot areas.

There are links between French literature and Walloon literature. For instance, the writer Raymond Queneau set the publication of a Walloon Poets&#x27; anthology for Editions Gallimard. &quot;Ubu roi&quot; was translated into Walloon by André Blavier, an important &#x27;pataphysician of Verviers, and friend of Queneau, for the new and important Puppet theater of Liège of Jacques Ancion. The Al Botroûle theater operated &quot;as the umbilical cord&quot; in Walloon, indicating a desire to return to the source. Jacques Ancion also wanted to develop a regular adult audience. &quot;From the 19th century he included the Walloon play &quot;Tati l&#x27;Pèriquî&quot; by E. Remouchamps and the avant-garde &quot;Ubu roi&quot; by A. Jarry.&quot; The scholar Jean-Marie Klinkenberg writes, &quot;[T]he dialectal culture is no more a sign of attachment to the past but a way to participate to a new synthesis&quot;.

Walloon is also being used in popular song. The best-known singer in Walloon in present-day Wallonia is William Dunker ( 15 March 1959).

<text>Chambourcin () is a variety of grapevine belonging to the &quot;Vitis&quot; genus in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. It is a French-American interspecific hybrid grape variety used for making wine. Its parentage is uncertain, but genetic studies show it likely includes several North American Vitis species in its background including: &quot;V. berlandieri&quot; Planch., &quot;V. labrusca&quot; L., &quot;V. lincecumii&quot; Buckley, &quot;V. riparia&quot; Michx., &quot;V. rupestris&quot; Scheele, and &quot;V. vinifera&quot;. The hybrid was produced by Joannes Seyve who often used Seibel hybrids produced in the 1860s. The grape has only been available since 1963; it has a good resistance to fungal disease, and is one of the parents of the new disease resistant variety, Regent, which is increasing in popularity among German grape growers.

Chambourcin is considered a very productive grape with crop yields reported ranging from 11.1 tons per hectare to 17.3 tons per hectare in a study performed by Ohio State University.

==Chambourcin wine==

The grape produces a deep-colored and aromatic wine. It can be made into a dry style or one with a moderate residual sugar level. Chambourcin is a teinturier, a grape whose juice is pink or red rather than clear like most red vitis vinifera cultivars.

The red juice fermented over the red skins can produce a very strongly flavoured wine. Most red wines are served at cellar temperature of to bring out the flavour but some Chambourcin wines have such a strong flavour that it is recommended that they be served chilled. 

===Wine regions===
Chambourcin has been planted widely in the mid-Atlantic region of North America, particularly in such states as New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. It is also grown in Harrow and Ruthven, Ontario, and in Kelowna, B.C., Canada; several counties in Virginia; Frederick, Washington, Harford, Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, Calvert County, Maryland, and St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland; Kent County, Delaware; Monroe County, Indiana; Daviess County, Kentucky; in the Ohio River Valley AVA Ohio; in the Lake Erie AVA of Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania; Greenbrier, Calhoun, Roane, and Mineral counties in West Virginia; Allegan County, Michigan; the Shawnee Hills AVA of southern Illinois; the Yadkin Valley and Haw River Valley of North Carolina; Western Tennessee in the Mississippi Delta AVA; Missouri[Augusta AVA] Missouri; south-central Kansas; Norman Oklahoma; New Zealand&#x27;s Northland Region; the Hunter Valley Region of New South Wales and other warm, humid regions in Australia; also in France and Portugal.

<doc id="294277" wikidata="Q58982" url="?curid=294277" title="Kilij Arslan II">
<text>Kilij Arslan II () or ʿIzz ad-Dīn Kilij Arslān ibn Masʿūd () (Modern Turkish &quot;Kılıç Arslan&quot;, meaning &quot;Sword Lion&quot;) was a Seljuk Sultan of Rûm from 1156 until his death in 1192.

==Reign==
In 1159, Kilij Arslan attacked Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus as he marched past Iconium (Konya, capital of Rüm), as Manuel returned from negotiating with Nur ad-Din Zengi in Syria. In 1161, Manuel&#x27;s nephew John Contostephanus defeated Kilij Arslan, and the sultan travelled to Constantinople in a show of submission. 

As Arnold of Lübeck reports in his &quot;Chronica Slavorum&quot;, he was present at the meeting of Henry the Lion with Kilij-Arslan during the former&#x27;s pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1172. When they met near Tarsus, the sultan embraced and kissed the German duke, reminding him that they were blood cousins (&#x27;amplexans et deosculans eum, dicens, eum consanguineum suum esse&#x27;). When the duke asked for details of this relationship, Kilij Arslan informed him that &#x27;a noble lady from the land of Germans married a king of Russia who had a daughter by her; this daughter&#x27;s daughter arrived to our land, and I descend from her.&#x27;
In 1173, Kilij Arslan, now at peace with the Byzantines, allied with Nur ad-Din against Mosul. The peace treaty with the Byzantines lasted until 1175, when Kilij Arslan refused to hand over to Manuel the territory conquered from the Danishmends, although both sides had for some time been building up their fortifications and armies in preparation for a renewed war. Kilij Arslan tried to negotiate, but Manuel invaded the sultanate in 1176, intending to capture Iconium itself. Kilij Arslan was able to defeat Emperor Manuel I Komnenos&#x27;s army at the Battle of Myriokephalon, the Sultan forced the emperor to negotiate a fragile peace.

In 1179, Kilij Arslan captured and held to ransom Henry I, the renowned count of Champagne, who was returning overland from a visit to Jerusalem. The ransom was paid by the Byzantine Emperor and Henry was released, but died soon afterwards.

In 1179, Pope Alexander III wrote to Kilij Arslan, whom he had heard was interested in converting to Christianity and desired information. According to the German chronicler Otto of Sankt Blasien, writing about thirty years later, the sultan also reached out at the same time to the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, seeking a marriage with the emperor&#x27;s daughter, Beatrice. According to Otto, Kilij Arslan offered to convert to Christianity along with his subjects. Frederick agreed to the marriage, but Beatrice died before it could take place. It is probable that Kilij Arslan&#x27;s overtures to pope and emperor were less about religion than about counterbalancing the Byzantines by pursuing warm relations with the west.

In 1180, the sultan took advantage of the instability in the Byzantine Empire after Manuel&#x27;s death to secure most of the southern coast of Anatolia, and sent his vizier Ikhtiyar al-Din to conclude an alliance with Saladin, Nur ad-Din&#x27;s successor, that same year. Then in 1182, he succeeded in capturing the city of Cotyaeum from the Byzantines. In 1185, he made peace with Emperor Isaac II Angelus, but the next year he transferred power to his eleven sons, who immediately fought each other for control. Despite Kilij Arslan&#x27;s alliance with Saladin, he promised the armies of the Third Crusade, led by Frederick Barbarossa to freely pass through his territories; however, his sons who were local chieftains disagreed and fought against the Crusaders at the Battle of Philomelion and Battle of Iconium. Following the Crusaders departure, his eldest son Qutb al-Din who led the Turks in the latter battle then fled afterwards, came back to control Konya; hence, Kilij Arslan II escaped and took refuge in Kayseri. Later on, Qutb al-Din declared himself to be the new Sultan, but his father and his brother Kaykhusraw I drove him out of Konya in 1192, then chased him to Aksaray, and besieged the city.

Kilij Arslan II died during the siege of Aksaray in August 1192, aged 77, after promising Kaykhusraw I the succession. Then he was buried in the Alâeddin Kosku in Konya. Kaykhusraw I&#x27;s brothers continued to fight for control of the other parts of the sultanate.

==Issue==
In 1186, Kilij Arslan II decided to divide the Sultanate among his 11 sons and 3 daughters as follows:
# Qutb al-Din (Sivas, Aksaray)
# Rukn al-Din (Tokat and its surroundings)
# Nur al-Din (Kayseri and its surroundings)
# Muqsed al-Din (Elbistan)
# Muizz al-Din Caesar Shah (Malatya) 
# Muhyiddin Mesut (Ankara, Çankırı, Kastamonu and Eskişehir)
# Kaykhusraw I (Uluborlu, Kutahya)
# Naser al-Din (Niksar, Koyulhisar)
# Nizam al-Din (Amasya)
# Arslanshah (Niğde)
# Sancarshah (Ereğli and its south)
# &quot;Fülane&quot; Hatun
# Gevher Nesibe Khatun
# Seljuki Khatun

<text>Joseph Norman Alessi (born September 20, 1959) is an American classical trombonist with the New York Philharmonic.

== Life ==
Joseph Norman Alessi was born in Detroit, Michigan and attended high school in San Rafael, California. His father, also named Joseph Alessi, was a professional trumpet player, and his mother, Maria (née Leone) sang in the Metropolitan Opera chorus. His younger brother Ralph Alessi is a jazz trumpeter. Displaying notable talent himself from an early age, Alessi graduated early from high school at age 16 and successfully auditioned to join the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra. During this time he appeared as a soloist with the San Francisco Symphony. In 1976-77, following a previously unsuccessful audition, Alessi gained entry to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he studied until 1980.

==Career==
During his third year at Curtis, Alessi joined the Philadelphia Orchestra as interim Second Trombone; he later won the job permanently and performed with the orchestra for four seasons. Following one season as Principal Trombone at the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, Alessi joined the New York Philharmonic as Principal Trombone in the Spring of 1985.

Alessi made his solo debut with the New York Philharmonic in 1990 when he performed the &quot;Fantasy for Trombone&quot; by Paul Creston. In 1992, he performed with the New York Philharmonic in the world premiere of the &quot;Trombone Concerto&quot; by Christopher Rouse, which later received the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Music. Alessi has since developed an increasingly active solo career, performing throughout the United States and internationally. His discography consists of over 14 full-length albums, in addition to guest appearances on albums by other artists. The New York Philharmonic has released recordings of the Rouse &quot;Concerto&quot; and the Colorado Symphony, featuring Alessi as soloist. His 1999 recording of &quot;Star-Child&quot;, by George Crumb, was voted Best Classical Contemporary Composition at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001.

Alessi joined the faculty of the Juilliard School in 1986, shortly after joining the New York Philharmonic. The Juilliard trombone studio has since furthered its international reputation as one of the most exemplary trombone college programs, and the Juilliard Trombone Choir has regularly performed with Alessi on his recording projects. Since 1999 Alessi has conducted the &quot;Alessi Seminar&quot;; a biennial trombone workshop that attracts trombonists from around the world to spend time with him in lessons, masterclasses, and recitals. Several of his past students now occupy senior positions in major orchestras throughout the world.

In recognition of Alessi&#x27;s immense contributions to the trombone community, he was awarded the 2002 &quot;ITA Award&quot;, the most prestigious award offered by the International Trombone Association.

==Playing style==
Joseph Alessi&#x27;s playing is often noted for refined musicianship, an extraordinarily rich sound quality and complete technical control. The music he chooses to play is mainly romantic, classical, and modern (but mainly tonal) music, while occasionally adding in some jazz playing.
