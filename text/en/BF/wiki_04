<text>Death was an American death metal band formed in Altamonte Springs, Florida, in 1983 by guitarist Chuck Schuldiner (who later became the band&#x27;s sole vocalist), drummer/vocalist Kam Lee and guitarist Rick Rozz. Formed out of what would become the Florida death metal scene, Death is considered to be a pioneering band in death metal. The band&#x27;s 1987 debut album, &quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot;, has been widely regarded as one of the first death metal records, alongside the first records from Possessed and Necrophagia.

Death had a revolving lineup, with Schuldiner, aside from a European tour, being the sole consistent member. The group&#x27;s style also progressed, from the raw sound on its first two albums to a more complex one in its later stage. The band disbanded after Schuldiner died of glioma and pneumonia in December 2001, but remains an enduring influence on heavy metal.

==History==

===Early history (1983–1985)===
Founded in either 1983 or 1984 by Chuck Schuldiner under the original name of Mantas in Altamonte Springs, Florida, Death was among the more widely known early pioneers of the death metal sound, along with California&#x27;s Possessed. Inspired by Nasty Savage, Death was among the first bands in the Florida death metal scene.

Together with Kam Lee, and Rick Rozz, Schuldiner started to compose songs that were released on several rehearsal tapes in 1984. These tapes, along with the &quot;Death by Metal&quot; demo, circulated through the tape-trader world, quickly establishing the band&#x27;s name. In 1984, Schuldiner dissolved Mantas and started a band under the name Death with the same members. Tim Aymar, in an article written in December 2010, states that Chuck Schuldiner renamed the band Death in order to turn his experience of the death of his brother Frank years earlier into &quot;something positive&quot;. Its members again included Rick Rozz and Kam Lee. Another demo was released, called &quot;Reign of Terror&quot;.

In 1985, the &quot;Infernal Death&quot; tape was recorded and released. Rick Rozz was out of the band by early 1985. Schuldiner and Lee played with Scott Carlson and Matt Olivo, bassist and guitarist respectively, of the band Genocide (later to be renamed Repulsion) for a short time. However, Kam had some &quot;personal problems&quot; that caused him to be ejected from the band. Combat Records had offered the band a deal if they recorded another demo, though the band was unsuccessful in convincing Kam to rejoin. Olivo and Carlson left soon afterward. Schuldiner moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and recruited former Dirty Rotten Imbeciles drummer Eric Brecht, then recorded the &quot;Back from the Dead&quot; demo. However, Chuck was not happy with this incarnation of Death and moved back to Florida without a band. In 1986, Schuldiner got an invitation from early Canadian thrash metal band Slaughter to play on their album, which he accepted, moving to Canada. However, this only lasted two weeks, and he returned to the States. He returned to Florida, then moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area again, where he joined with 17-year-old drummer Chris Reifert.

=== Record deal and &quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot; (1986-1987) ===
Schuldiner and Reifert recorded the &quot;Mutilation&quot; demo in April 1986, which led to a deal with Combat Records. That summer, they began recording their first album, which was abandoned and written off as a mistake after Combat was not satisfied with the recording, which Reifert blamed on the studio engineers. In November 1986, the band was sent to Los Angeles to re-record the album at The Music Grinder with Randy Burns, which the band felt optimistic about due to his work on Possessed&#x27;s &quot;Seven Churches&quot;. The basic tracks were recorded in a couple of days, while the bass, lead guitars and vocals were recorded by Schuldiner at Rock Steady Studios, which was also in L.A. 

&quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot; was released in 1987, widely considered a genre template for death metal. The band briefly had a second guitar player, John Hand, but he did not appear on the album (though his photo did). Schuldiner and Reifert recruited Steve Di Giorgio of Sadus and rehearsed in Concord for live shows, which never took place as Schuldiner decided to move back to Florida. Reifert had chosen to remain in California, where he went on to form Autopsy. Once back in Florida, Schuldiner teamed up with former bandmate Rick Rozz and two members of Rozz&#x27;s band Massacre, Terry Butler and Bill Andrews.

===Mid-era (1988–1992)===
In 1988, that line-up recorded &quot;Leprosy&quot;. After much touring in support of the album, including a quick and ill-planned tour of Europe, Rick Rozz was fired in 1989. After a tour of Mexico featuring guitarist Paul Masvidal (later to re-emerge in the Death lineup), a replacement was found in James Murphy, with whom the third album &quot;Spiritual Healing&quot; was recorded in Tampa in the summer of 1989. Murphy left the band relatively quickly. By this time Schuldiner abandoned the &quot;gore&quot; lyrical theme for more social critique and melody was added to the band&#x27;s sound.

In 1990, on the eve of a European tour, Schuldiner decided against traveling, claiming at the last minute that he felt the tour was not adequately organized (and citing the group&#x27;s previous disorganized European tour in 1988) as well as having some personal problems. Andrews and Butler continued with the tour of Europe as &#x27;Death&#x27; to fulfill the band&#x27;s contractual obligations, and recruited roadies Walter Trachsler and Louie Carrisalez to replace Schuldiner on guitar and vocals, respectively. Schuldiner reacted with shock and disgust, and pursued legal action against Butler and Andrews.

Schuldiner abandoned the idea of a band set-up altogether and began working with session musicians only. Schuldiner recruited Paul Masvidal and Sean Reinert from underground Florida band Cynic and hired Steve Di Giorgio from California band Sadus. In 1991, Death released &quot;Human&quot;, which is considered a more technical and progressive album than their previous works, incorporating complex rhythms, riffs and song structures. &quot;Human&quot; was Death&#x27;s best-selling album yet, receiving many accolades and some MTV play for the group&#x27;s first video, directed by David Bellino, for the track &quot;Lack of Comprehension&quot;. Due to obligations with his primary band Sadus, Di Giorgio departed after the recording of &quot;Human&quot; and new bassist Scott Carino did Death&#x27;s extensive world tour, from October 1991 until March 1992, in addition to appearing in the music video for &quot;Lack of Comprehension&quot;.

===Final years and Schuldiner&#x27;s death (1993–2001)===
In 1993, Reinert and Masvidal left the group to continue with the band Cynic, as they were working on Cynic&#x27;s debut full-length album at the time, &quot;Focus&quot;. Schuldiner then enlisted drummer Gene Hoglan of the recently dissolved thrash metal band Dark Angel, and Andy LaRocque from King Diamond guesting on guitar for &quot;Individual Thought Patterns&quot; in addition to Steve Di Giorgio returning to the band. Since LaRocque was obligated to his band, Schuldiner hired a then-unknown Ralph Santolla as touring guitarist. Death was arguably at the peak of their commercial and popular culture success, and the video for the track &quot;The Philosopher&quot; even made it on to an episode of Beavis &amp; Butt-head in 1994 (Beavis also parodies Schuldiner&#x27;s vocals in a mock &#x27;drive-thru&#x27; order of &#x27;tacos, to go!&#x27; in death-metal style). Also in 1994, Death abandoned its eight-year relationship with Relativity and signed with Roadrunner Records, their European distributor. For 1995&#x27;s &quot;Symbolic&quot;, Santolla and Di Giorgio were exchanged for underground Florida musicians Kelly Conlon and Bobby Koelble. For the Symbolic tour Brian Benson was brought in on bass
(Conlon was let go from the band prior to the tour).

After &quot;Symbolic&quot;, Schuldiner broke up Death after tension with Roadrunner Records and focused on Control Denied. The seventh Death release, titled &quot;The Sound of Perseverance&quot;, included Florida musicians Richard Christy, Shannon Hamm and Scott Clendenin, and the album was completed at Morrisound Recording in Tampa and released on Nuclear Blast in 1998.

After the album and two supporting tours, Schuldiner put Death aside to pursue Control Denied with Christy and Hamm. Clendenin was dropped in favor of Steve Di Giorgio, who was once again available, and an underground power metal singer named Tim Aymar. Although the line-up and writing style was largely the same, Schuldiner created Control Denied in large part because he was displeased with the harsher vocals for Death. He opted to create a new band in order to avoid betraying what Death meant and sounded like to fans, remarking: &quot;For me, it is just a matter of evolving, doing it the right way. I didn&#x27;t put out a Death record with this stuff on it. I made the right choice and changed the name of the band. I tried to do everything the right way.&quot; As Schuldiner finished Control Denied&#x27;s debut album, he was diagnosed with brain cancer, forcing the band to scrap plans for a U.S. and Canadian tour. As he worked on the second release, Schuldiner&#x27;s condition improved, but the tumor left him in a weakened, vulnerable state. He contracted pneumonia and was placed in a hospital. On December 13, 2001, Schuldiner was released and returned home. An hour after arriving home, he died.

===Aftermath (2001–onwards)===
The second Control Denied release was not completed. Mired in legal problems involving its Dutch label, the musicians and Schuldiner&#x27;s sister Beth, the former of whom have publicly stated their desire to complete the album, and former manager Eric Greif representing the Estate. In 2004, Hammerheart Records released a two-part bootleg made up of old, pre-&quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot; demos, along with partial demos of the unfinished album and live Death recordings from 1990. This was issued under the name Chuck Schuldiner, not Death or Control Denied, but its markedly unfinished state and lack of vocals led to the release not being successful, aided by Schuldiner&#x27;s mother Jane&#x27;s pleas for fans to stay away from it. In October 2009, Greif litigated against Hammerheart, representing Schuldiner&#x27;s estate, and all matters were settled by December, theoretically allowing for the Control Denied album to be completed by the other musicians.

Members of Death have since stayed active as musicians. Gene Hoglan from Dark Angel and Andy LaRocque from King Diamond had already made a name for themselves, with LaRocque continuing to work with King Diamond while Hoglan has done stints with a wide variety of bands including Strapping Young Lad, Old Man&#x27;s Child, Opeth, Zimmers Hole, Unearth, Pitch Black Forecast, Dethklok, Fear Factory, and most recently, Testament. Paul Masvidal found success with Cynic alongside fellow Death member Sean Reinert, who continue to release albums and tour in the present. Richard Christy went on to gigs with Acheron and Iced Earth before joining The Howard Stern Show, though he has recently resurfaced on the metal scene with Charred Walls of the Damned and guesting on a Crotchduster album. Ralph Santolla has also played with Iced Earth, as well as Sebastian Bach; both are bands which Steve DiGiorgio played in as well. Santolla was in Obituary and he was previously in Deicide. Di Giorgio also played for Testament and is still active with his original band Sadus. Bobby Koelble founded the Orlando rock-funk-Latin fusion group JunkieRush in 2000. He joined the Jazz faculty of the University of Central Florida (UCF) in 2007, and performs and records with The Jazz Professors. James Murphy was also in Testament, formed projects such as Disincarnate, as well as having stints with death metal bands Obituary and Cancer. Murphy was also stricken with a noncancerous brain tumor, for which he received treatment, and, along with Deron Miller of CKY, attempted to organize a Death tribute album. Kam Lee became well known as the frontman and face of the band Massacre, and formed the band Denial Fiend with Terry Butler, who has also found success in Six Feet Under and is currently in Obituary. Lee also continues to perform and record today with numerous underground projects, including Bone Gnawer and The Grotesquery. Scott Clendenin died on March 24, 2015, at the age of 48.

On May 12, 2010, it was announced that Perseverance Holdings Ltd. had partnered with Relapse Records to re-master and re-issue the Death and Control Denied releases, as well as his earlier work in Mantas. On December 13 of the same year, it was announced that &quot;The Sound of Perseverance&quot; would be the first Death album to receive this treatment, and was released February 2011 in a 2-CD and 3-CD format. The &quot;Human&quot; album has been remixed, with Schuldiner&#x27;s intellectual property lawyer Eric Greif stating that Sony had lost the tapes of the original mixes, and was reissued in 2-CD and 3-CD formats as well as a digital release. Shortly after, the &quot;Individual Thought Patterns&quot; album was reissued. In February 2012, Relapse Records released a 2 CD live album entitled Vivus! that included the previously released 1998 concerts &quot;Live in L.A.&quot; and &quot;Live in Eindhoven&quot;, including liner notes by drummer Christy and manager/lawyer Greif. The Relapse deal does not include Death&#x27;s acclaimed 1995 album &quot;Symbolic&quot;, whose rights are still retained by Roadrunner Records .

On March 16, 2012, it was announced by Sick Drummer Magazine and the Schuldiner&#x27;s corporation, Perseverance Holdings Ltd, that musicians who previously played in Death would take part in a benefit tour titled &quot;Death to All&quot; for the Sweet Relief Musicians Fund. The former Death members slated to participate were drummers Gene Hoglan and Sean Reinert, bassists Steve Di Giorgio and Scott Clendenin, guitarists Paul Masvidal, Shannon Hamm and Bobby Koelble. It was later announced that Obscura vocalist Steffen Kummerer and Abysmal Dawn/Bereft frontman Charles Elliott would assume vocal and guitar duties for the tour, but visa issues made Kummerer&#x27;s participation impossible and he was replaced by Exhumed vocalist/guitarist Matt Harvey. After the tour, Eric Greif, acting as President of Perseverance Holdings Ltd. (PHL), alleged that the owners of Sick Drummer Magazine had not paid the charity, the musicians, PHL, the crew or the booking agency despite the five shows of the tour being successful. However, dates for a second edition of the tour were announced in February 2013, with no involvement from Sick Drummer Magazine, and a successful tour of North America in April 2013 was followed by a sold out three-week European tour in November 2013, featuring Masvidal, Reinert, Di Giorgio and vocalist/guitarist Max Phelps. The Death To All moniker was altered to Death (DTA).

On November 3, 2021, it was announced that former Death members would play two Florida shows in December 2021 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the passing of Schuldiner. The lineup will feature James Murphy and Terry Butler, as well as Gus Rios and Matt Harvey of Gruesome playing under the name Living Monstrosity, who will play &quot;Spiritual Healing&quot; in its entirety. Steve DiGiorgio, Bobby Koelble, Kelly Conlon, Dirk Verbeuren, Max Phelps, and Leo Lozano will play under the name Symbolic, playing songs from &quot;Human&quot;, &quot;Individual Thought Patterns&quot;, &quot;Symbolic&quot;, and &quot;The Sound of Perseverance&quot;.

Phelps, Di Giorgio, Koelble and Hoglan will take part in a North American tour in the spring of 2023 under the name Death To All (DTA) to commemorate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Individual Thought Patterns&quot;.

Rozz, Butler, Harvey, and Rios are actively performing at live events in 2024 under the name Left to Die. The band formed not long after Harvey and Rios played the Death tribute show in 2021.

==Artistry==
=== Musical style and instrumentation ===
Death were considered pioneers of the death metal subgenre of heavy metal. According to Malcolm Dome of Metal Hammer, Death &quot;took the thrash template and intensified it, adding guttural vocals, a style that few outside the tape trading network would have been familiar with.&quot; Music biographer Garry Sharpe-Young considered Death &quot;a genre-breaking band centered upon frontman Chuck Schuldiner&quot; and that the band &quot;would become one of the prime instigators of the death metal movement&quot;. However, Schuldiner dismissed such attributions by stating, in an interview with Metal-Rules.com, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I should take the credits for this death metal stuff. I&#x27;m just a guy from a band, and I think Death is a metal band&quot;. In Death&#x27;s later output, their music became more technical and melodic, showcasing a technical death metal, progressive metal, and melodic death metal style. According to Loudwire, &quot;With 1990’s &quot;Spiritual Healing&quot;, Death started to transform into a progressive, technical death metal band, adding abrupt 90-degree rhythm shifts and multiple tempo changes without sacrificing their heavy groove.&quot; Joe DiVita of Loudwire said &quot;along with Carcass and At the Gates, Death helped pave the way for infectious melodies and hooks to enter the genre.&quot; Complex time signatures also became a hallmark of the band&#x27;s style later in their career.

Regarding percussion styles, Gene Hoglan is recognised as a percussionist using double kick drum equipment and one of a crop who &quot;set new standards in speed and endurance&quot;. During an interview he described Sean Reinert&#x27;s drumming on &quot;Human&quot; as &quot;godly&quot;, and praised it as &quot;the fastest double bassing around at the time&quot; and &quot;a template which we tried to match on &quot;Individual Thought Patterns&quot;&quot;.

=== Imagery and lyrics ===
The band&#x27;s early releases were described as having taken a &quot;gratuitous gorehound lyrical approach&quot;, exploring topics such as zombies and slasher-film style violence. Later releases dealt with topics such as religion, serial killers and substance abuse. Schuldiner said, &quot;I got fed up with writing about crap monsters. [...] What’s horrific about that sort of thing? The real evil in this world goes on in society. I’d just reached a time in my life as a person and as a musician when I felt angry enough to write about it.”

Kam Lee designed Death&#x27;s original logo before he was removed from the band. Schuldiner subsequently designed the logo&#x27;s various incarnations throughout the remainder of the band&#x27;s existence. In 1991, before the release of &quot;Human&quot;, he cleaned up the logo; he took out more intricate details, and the &quot;T&quot; in the logo was swapped from an inverted cross to a more regular-looking &quot;T&quot;, one reason being to quash any implication of being anti-religious. The logo was changed again, between &quot;Symbolic&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Perseverance&quot;, to &quot;a more streamlined look&quot;; also, a hooded reaper was removed above the &quot;H&quot;.

=== Influences ===
Schuldiner was quoted saying, &quot;I love the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal [...] but I wanted to combine their style with the harder end; with what Slayer and Venom were doing. I didn’t set out to create something new – it just happened.&quot; His main influences as a guitarist were Yngwie Malmsteen, Eddie Van Halen and both Dave Murray and Adrian Smith of Iron Maiden. He was also influenced by numerous bands such as Black Sabbath, Kiss, Van Halen, Saxon, Iron Maiden, Rush, Raven, Mercyful Fate, Venom, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Savatage, Slayer, Metallica, Anthrax, Exciter, Manowar, Judas Priest, Nasty Savage, Possessed and Sacrifice. As inspirations to the technical/progressive direction of Death&#x27;s last four studio albums, the band also cited Queensrÿche, Dream Theater, Carcass, Coroner, Watchtower and Psychotic Waltz.

== Legacy and influence ==
Death is considered to be both a pioneering force in death metal, and one of the most influential bands in the history of heavy metal in general. Dom Lawson of Metal Hammer wrote, &quot;few could dispute that Chuck Schuldiner and Death towered over the entire scene for the entirety of their all-too-brief existence.&quot; Eli Enis at Revolver wrote, &quot;With each album, from 1987 debut &quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot; to their 1998 swansong &quot;The Sound of Perseverance&quot;, Schuldiner and Co. delivered songs that not only defined the genre, but helped push it into its most progressive and exciting realms.&quot; Blabbermouth wrote &quot;each of Death&#x27;s seven studio albums can be seen as both a fully-realized milestone in metal history, and a transition point leading into a future few could envision at the time.&quot; Dom Lawson of Metal Hammer wrote, &quot;[Death] were always a couple of steps ahead of the game and audibly, thrillingly devoted to pushing extreme metal into uncharted territory.&quot; &quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot; is widely regarded as the first death metal album. Death is also now recognized as one of the most acclaimed music groups of all time, held in high praise by critics, metal musicians, and fans.

Many bands cited Death as a influence such as Obituary, Hail of Bullets, Meshuggah, Baroness, Cormorant, Fear Factory, Revocation, Exhumed, Obscura, Cynic, Opeth, the Dillinger Escape Plan, Suicide Silence, Mastodon, Gojira and System of a Down. Kelly Schaefer of Atheist stated that Schuldiner&#x27;s spirit of competition inspired the band to pursue innovation in the death metal genre themselves. George &quot;Corpsegrinder&quot; Fisher of Cannibal Corpse said that Schuldiner &quot;inspired [him] to become death metal singer.&quot; 

Death&#x27;s influence extends beyond the death metal genre. Corey Taylor of Slipknot has cited Death as an important influence. Herman Li and all the members of DragonForce have expressed their appreciation for Death, and covered &quot;Evil Dead&quot; on their album &quot;Reaching Into Infinity&quot;, saying they consider the band &quot;legendary&quot;.

In January 2001, Mahyar Dean, an Iranian musician, wrote &quot;&quot;, a book about Death and Schuldiner, and released it in Iran. The book includes bilingual lyrics and many articles about the band. The book was sent from the site keepers of emptywords.org to Schuldiner, who in his words was &quot;truly blown away and extremely honored by the obvious work and devotion he put into bringing the book to life&quot;. A documentary entitled &quot;Death by Metal&quot; was released in 2016.

<text>Michael Deane Harris (born January 23, 1945) is a retired Canadian politician who served as the 22nd premier of Ontario from 1995 to 2002 and leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (PC Party) from 1990 to 2002. Taking the PC Party to the right, he is noted for the &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot;, his government&#x27;s program of fiscally conservative policies.

Born in Toronto, Harris grew up in North Bay and worked as a ski instructor and schoolteacher before becoming a school board trustee in 1974. In 1981, he became a member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the riding of Nipissing. He became leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in the 1990 leadership election. That same year, a provincial election was called in which Harris led the PCs to a modest boost in support, though they still remained in third place. However, five years later, he led the PCs to a strong majority government in the 1995 provincial election. He led the party to a second majority in 1999.

As party leader and premier, Harris shifted the historically centrist PC Party to the right by embracing the Common Sense Revolution, which emphasized lower taxes, deficit reduction, cuts to public spending, and privatization. His government reduced personal income taxes by 30 percent, privatized Highway 407, and privatized provincial water testing which was viewed as controversial especially after the Walkerton &quot;E. coli outbreak&quot;. He oversaw cuts to healthcare, infrastructure, and education spending, the last of which led to the 1997 Ontario teachers&#x27; strike, the largest teachers&#x27; strike in Ontario history. In 1999, Harris&#x27; government balanced the budget. In administrative policy, his government reduced the number of MPPs from 130 to 103 between 1995 and 1999, and oversaw the Amalgamation of Toronto. In his final years in office, his government introduced a tax credit for parents who send their children to private schools.

In 2002, Harris retired as premier and PC leader, and was succeeded by Ernie Eves in both capacities. After leaving office, Harris went into the private sector and became a fellow at the Fraser Institute, a conservative think tank.

==Background==
Harris was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Hope Gooding (born Robinson) and Sidney Deane Harris. He grew up in North Bay, where his father operated the Wasi Falls Resort fishing camp. Harris attended Waterloo Lutheran University (now Wilfrid Laurier University) but left after a year.

At the age of 21, following his father&#x27;s purchase of a ski hill, Harris moved for two years to Sainte-Adèle, Quebec, where he became a ski instructor. After the end of his first marriage, he enrolled at Laurentian University and North Bay Teacher&#x27;s College where he received his teaching certificate. He was employed as an elementary school teacher at W. J. Fricker Public School in North Bay where he taught grade seven and eight mathematics for several years in a new open-concept class of 120 students. He continued in his previous occupation as a ski-instructor at Nipissing Ridge on weekends as well as working at his father&#x27;s fishing camp during the summer season. He eventually left the teaching profession as the success of the ski resort escalated. After his father sold his ski-hill operation, Harris was hired to manage North Bay&#x27;s Pinewood Golf Club.

==Early political career==
Harris was elected to public office as a school board trustee in 1974. He entered provincial politics in the 1981 election, and defeated Mike Bolan, the incumbent Liberal MPP in Nipissing. Harris later suggested that he was motivated to enter politics by an opposition to the policies of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

Harris sat as a backbencher in Bill Davis&#x27;s PC government from 1981 to 1985. He supported Frank Miller&#x27;s successful bid to succeed Davis as party leader in 1985 and took the role of rival candidate Dennis Timbrell to prepare Miller for the party&#x27;s all-candidate debates. Miller was sworn in as premier of Ontario on February 8, 1985, and appointed Harris as minister of natural resources.

The Tories were reduced to a minority government in the 1985 provincial election, although Harris was personally re-elected without difficulty. He kept the natural resources portfolio after the election, and was also named minister of energy on May 17, 1985. The Miller government was soon defeated on a motion of no confidence by David Peterson&#x27;s Liberals and Bob Rae&#x27;s New Democratic Party (NDP).

An agreement between the Liberals and the NDP allowed a Liberal minority government to govern for two years in exchange for the implementation of certain NDP policies. This decision consigned the Tories to opposition for the first time in 42 years. Miller resigned and was replaced by Larry Grossman, who led the party to a disastrous showing in the 1987 election and announced his resignation shortly thereafter. Harris was again re-elected in Nipissing without difficulty.

==Leadership (1990)==
Grossman, who had lost his legislative seat, remained the leader of the party until 1990, while Sarnia MPP Andy Brandt served as &quot;interim leader&quot; in the legislature. Harris was chosen as PC house leader, and had become the party&#x27;s dominant voice in the legislature by 1989. Harris entered the 1990 leadership race, and defeated Dianne Cunningham in a province-wide vote to replace Grossman as the party&#x27;s official leader.

The 1990 provincial election was called soon after Harris became party leader. With help from past leader Larry Grossman, Harris managed to rally his party&#x27;s core supporters with pledges of tax cuts and spending reductions. Due to his teaching background, Harris was personally endorsed by several local members of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers&#x27; Federation (OSSTF). The election was won by Bob Rae&#x27;s NDP. The Conservatives increased their seat total from 17 to 20 out of 130. Despite some early concerns, Harris was again able to retain his own seat.

==1995 election==
On 3 May 1994, Harris unveiled his &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot; platform. It called for significant spending and tax cuts, as well as elimination of the province&#x27;s record $11 billion deficit.

By the 1995 election, the governing New Democratic Party and incumbent Premier Bob Rae had become unpopular with the electorate, partly due to the state of the Ontario economy and its record debt and deficit amidst a Canada-wide recession. Lyn McLeod&#x27;s Liberals were leading in pre-election polls and were expected to benefit from the swing in support away from the NDP, but they began losing support due to several controversial policy reversals and what was generally regarded as an uninspiring campaign. The turning point in the election is often considered to be Harris&#x27;s performance in the televised leaders&#x27; debate. Harris used his camera time to speak directly to the camera to convey his party&#x27;s Common Sense Revolution platform. The Rae government had previously lost much of its base in organized labour, due in part to the unpopularity of its &quot;Social Contract&quot; legislation in 1993 (which Harris, after some initial vacillations, eventually voted against). Harris&#x27;s opposition to Rae&#x27;s affirmative action measures helped him to capture some unionized-worker support during the election, particularly among male workers.

Although there were regional variations, many union voters shifted from the NDP to the PCs in 1995 (instead of to the Liberals as expected pre-campaign), enabling the PCs to win a number of new ridings, such as Cambridge and Oshawa, which had long supported the NDP. In addition roughly half of the PCs seats came from the suburban belt surrounding Metro Toronto, often called the &#x27;905&#x27; for its telephone area code. The PCs&#x27; growth from 20 to 82 seats in the 130 seat legislature vaulted them from third place to a large majority government.

==Premier of Ontario (1995–2002)==
===First term (1995–1999) ===

====Common Sense Revolution ====

In 1995, shortly after taking office, the Mike Harris government repealed Ontario’s Employment Equity Act, 1993. Aimed to promote workplace diversity by addressing systemic barriers faced by women, Indigenous peoples, racialized communities, and individuals with disabilities.

The government argued that the Employment Equity Act imposed unnecessary burdens on businesses and conflicted with the principle of hiring based on merit rather than quotas or targeted diversity initiatives. Critics pointed out that the removal of employment equity legislation disproportionately impacted racialized communities and women, further entrenching systemic discrimination in hiring practices.

Upon election, the Harris government immediately began to implement a far-reaching reform agenda to cut the large provincial deficit accumulated under the previous Rae government. One of its first major policy decisions in 1995 was to cut social assistance rates by 21.6%. The government argued that too many people were taking advantage of the program, and that it acted as a disincentive for seeking employment. The government also introduced &quot;Ontario Works&quot;, frequently referred to as &quot;workfare&quot;, a program that required able-bodied welfare recipients to participate in either training or job placements.

Provincial income taxes were cut by 30% to pre-1990 levels. In addition, a new Fair Share Health Levy was established and charged to high-income earners to help pay for mounting health care costs.

Shortly after assuming office, the Harris government announced that several hundred nurses would be laid off to cut costs in the health sector. The government also implemented a series of hospital closures and amalgamations on the recommendations of a Health Services Restructuring Commission. Harris compared the laid off hospital workers to the people who lost their jobs after the hula hoop fad died down in the early 1960s, commenting &quot;Just as Hula-Hoops went out and those workers had to have a factory and a company that would manufacture something else that&#x27;s in, it&#x27;s the same in government, and you know, governments have put off these decisions for so many years that restructuring sometimes is painful&quot;.

The Harris government cut funding of major urban infrastructure projects upon assuming office. Though construction had already begun on the Eglinton West subway in Toronto, a proposed rapid transit line to ultimately link the main north–south subway line of the city with the suburbs and airport, funding was cancelled shortly after Harris&#x27;s election.

Harris&#x27;s government also cut health spending to counter the $30 billion cut in transfer payments from the Liberal federal government. It also introduced Telehealth Ontario, a 24-hour toll-free telephone help line with live connection to registered nurses. Harris also announced funding vehicles such as the Ontario R&amp;D Challenge Fund, the Ontario Innovation Trust and the Premier&#x27;s Research Excellence Awards.

One part of the Common Sense Revolution was to sell off various government-owned enterprises, the largest of which were to be Ontario Hydro and the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. Neither was actually sold off, but Ontario Hydro was split into five successor companies (the two largest being Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, representing generation and distribution of power respectively) with the plan of eventually selling them off. Public opposition to the sale of these money-making government enterprises postponed the government&#x27;s plans. In 1999, Highway 407 was leased to a private consortium.

Harris reduced the number of MPPs from 130 to 103 by redrawing riding boundaries to correspond to federal electoral districts.

The Harris government passed Bill 26, the &quot;Savings and Restructuring Act&quot;, which undertook an extensive program of municipal mergers between 1996 and 2002. The province had 815 municipalities in 1996; by 2002, this had been reduced to 447. In the largest and most widely covered of these moves, the individual cities that made up Metro Toronto were merged into a single city (called the &quot;megacity&quot; by the media and citizens); the amalgamation was not part of their pre-election policy platform. The Conservatives argued that the move would eliminate duplication of services and increase efficiency. Opposition parties were strongly opposed to the move; the NDP took the unusual step of attempting to filibuster against the bill by reading out the name of every street in Toronto. In order to further reduce provincial commitments, financial responsibility for provincial income assistance programs was transferred or &quot;downloaded&quot; to municipalities, increasing the burden on municipal tax bases. The list of municipalities in Ontario was updated by the &quot;Municipal Act, 2001&quot;, which is the legislation that enables incorporation and stipulates governance of Ontario&#x27;s municipalities, excluding the City of Toronto, which is now subject to the &quot;City of Toronto Act, 2006&quot;. The &quot;Municipal Act, 2001&quot; provides lower and single-tier municipalities with the authority to incorporate as cities, towns, villages, townships, or generically as municipalities.

The Harris government also passed the &quot;Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act&quot; in 1996, publishing so-called Sunshine lists annually to disclose wages and benefits of public employees earning over $100,000 per year, to increase accountability.

====Education====

The Harris government introduced several education reforms. The fifth year of high school in Ontario, (known as the OAC year), was eliminated. This created a double graduating class in 2003 (known as the &quot;double cohort&quot;). Harris introduced Bill 160, (the &quot;Education Quality Improvement Act&quot;), which mandated a standardized curriculum and province-wide testing for students. This included Grade 3 and 6 EQAO (numeracy and literacy) testing, as well as a Grade 10 Literacy test. Harris introduced a requirement for High School students to complete a mandatory 40 hours of volunteering in community service in order to graduate.

In 1999, it introduced a policy of &quot;teacher testing&quot;, requiring teachers to take examinations on a regular basis. Principals and vice-principals were removed from the [OTF].

The introduction of the Safe Schools Act in 2000, which enforced a zero-tolerance approach to school discipline. This policy led to mandatory suspensions and expulsions for certain infractions, disproportionately affecting Black students and contributing to their disengagement from the education system. 

Additionally, the practice of academic streaming in Ontario, which involves grouping students based on perceived ability, has been criticized for disproportionately placing Black students in lower academic tracks. This has limited their access to opportunities that lead to university education, thereby perpetuating educational inequities. 

This streaming practice remained in place until 2020, when Premier Doug Ford&#x27;s government announced plans to end streaming in Grade 9. The decision aimed to address systemic discrimination and bring Ontario&#x27;s education system in line with other provinces. The government acknowledged that streaming had disproportionately impacted racialized students, particularly Black and Indigenous students, by steering them into applied courses and limiting their future opportunities. 

==== 1995 referendum on the separation of Quebec ====
Harris, along with Stephen Harper, was appointed negotiator by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to face Quebec negotiators nominated by the separatist leaders of Quebec: Lucien Bouchard and Mario Dumont. At the time of the referendum campaign, Harris affirmed that &quot;a separate Quebec would be a foreign country. Final point.&quot;

====Ipperwash crisis====
Shortly after being sworn in, Harris faced his first crisis as premier. Protesters fighting land claim issues took over a provincial park 200 kilometres west of Toronto. During a confrontation with the demonstrators, Ontario Provincial Police acting Sergeant Kenneth Deane fired on First Nations demonstrators who had occupied the park, killing a protester named Dudley George. Members of the Stoney Point Ojibway band occupied Ipperwash Provincial Park outside of Grand Bend, protesting a protracted land claims process. The Ipperwash Inquiry would later be called by the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty, due to recalcitrance on Harris&#x27;s part.

===Second term (1999–2002)===
In 1999, the Harris government was re-elected for a second term with a majority government, helped largely by its political base in the suburban areas around Toronto.

The Harris government balanced the provincial budget in 1999. Harris supporters pointed to the fact that government revenues rose from $48 billion in 1995 to $64 billion by 2001, when the budget was balanced.

In 1999 Harris also announced a program called Ontario&#x27;s Living Legacy. The initiative added 378 new parks and protected areas, bringing the total in Ontario to 650 and increasing Ontario&#x27;s protected areas to more than .

Controversy arose in 2000 when the town water supply of Walkerton became infected by E. coli. Seven people died and hundreds became ill. Provincial water testing had been privatized in October 1996 by Harris&#x27;s first government. It was later discovered the local official responsible for water quality, Stan Koebel, had lied, falsified records, failed to test water quality regularly, and when the outbreak occurred had failed to promptly notify the local medical officer of health. In late 2004, Koebel pleaded guilty to a minor charge in relation to the offence and was sentenced to one year in jail.

The Walkerton tragedy had serious ramifications for Harris&#x27;s government. Harris blamed the previous NDP government for loosening water standards. Harris called a public inquiry, headed by Justice Dennis O&#x27;Connor, which later noted that in addition to Stan Koebel&#x27;s failure to properly monitor and treat the water supply, deregulation of water quality testing and cuts to the Ministry of the Environment were contributing factors. The inquest into the tragedy found that the government cuts to inspection services and their privatization had created a situation in which future water safety could not be guaranteed. The Ontario government was also blamed for not regulating water quality and not enforcing the guidelines that had been in place.

An uprising developed at Queen&#x27;s Park, the site of the Ontario Legislature, on June 15, 2000. The Ontario Coalition Against Poverty and other activists, including MPP of Toronto Centre, George Smitherman, protested the Harris ministry policies that were resulting in the transfer of wealth to the welathy from everyone else. Some of the protesters lobbed molotov cocktails, bricks, and bottles.

Harris&#x27;s government reduced Ontario welfare rolls by 500,000 people; critics contend these cuts led to a rise in homelessness and poverty. Supporters argued that high welfare rates had created disincentives to find entry-level jobs, and that poverty levels remained relatively unchanged between 1995 and 2005. Employment rates increased significantly during the late 1990s. The government rewrote labour laws to require secret ballot votes before workplaces could unionize. The previous NDP government&#x27;s law outlawing the hiring of replacement workers during strikes was repealed.

Other changes brought in by the Harris government include standardized math and literacy student tests, known as EQAO. EQAO testing is conducted in Grade 3 and 6 (for math and literacy) and 9 (for math only). Teachers are not allowed to preview the tests ahead of time, eliminating the risk of &#x27;teaching to the test&#x27;. School principals are required to discuss EQAO results during staff meetings, and plan their focus accordingly. In Grade 10, high school students are required to pass a literacy test in order to graduate. A new provincial funding formula for school boards stripped the local boards of their taxation powers.

In 2001, the Harris government introduced a plan to give a tax credit for parents who send their children to private and denominational schools (despite having campaigned against such an initiative in 1999). Supporters claimed it was fair given the public funding of Catholic schools, while opponents were concerned about a potential diversion of resources and students from the public system. Harris also broke with tradition to place backbench MPPs on Cabinet committees.

Harris resigned as premier and MPP on April 14, 2002 and was succeeded as PC leader and premier by his long-time friend and minister of finance, Ernie Eves.

==After politics (2002–present)==

Soon after leaving office, Harris joined the Toronto law firm Goodmans LLP, where he served as an advisor until 2010.

Later in 2002, Harris also joined the Fraser Institute, a right-of-centre libertarian think tank, as a senior fellow. It was there that he became involved with the ideals of Preston Manning, becoming a major influence in federal politics as well as Alberta. Harris served on the board of directors of the Manning Centre.

In January 2003, Harris was named to the board of directors of Magna International. More recently in 2011, he was criticized for accepting re-election to the board of Magna despite receiving only 38% of shareholder support. This was possible since shareholder votes in Canada are either counted as &quot;for&quot; a director or else considered as &quot;withheld&quot;, meaning that they are not counted. In 2012, Harris indicated that he would step down from the board of directors at Magna International after completing a process to collapse the company&#x27;s dual-class share structure that he helped begin in 2010.

He was later involved in a minor controversy, yelling and repeatedly swearing at a party official who asked him for his identification as he voted in the 2004 Ontario Progressive Conservative Party leadership election.

In late May 2010, Nipissing University confirmed that Harris would receive an honorary doctorate. In response, the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Federation threatened to discourage, or even prevent, their members from acting as associate teachers for students in Nipissing University&#x27;s Bachelor of Education program, which requires students to complete 12 weeks of practice teaching in a classroom. Nipissing University&#x27;s $25 million Harris Learning Library, which opened in 2011, is named after the former premier.

In 2012, Harris started a local Nurse Next Door Home Care franchise in Toronto with wife Laura. In May 2014, Harris co-led an independent Canadian mission to observe the Ukrainian presidential election.

In 2018 Ontario general election, his son Mike Harris Jr. was elected as MPP for Kitchener-Conestoga, also a member of the Progressive Conservative Party. Today, Harris serves as the Chair of the Board for Chartwell Retirement Residences. During the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Chartwell and other for-profit facilities had &quot;far worse COVID-19 outcomes than public facilities&quot; after paying hundreds of millions to shareholders over the last decade. Since joining the board, Mike Harris has been compensated roughly $3.5-million for his services.

===Ipperwash Inquest (2005–2007)===

In the inquiry following the Ipperwash Crisis, it was determined that while some protesters were carrying rocks, sticks and baseball bats, none were carrying firearms. The confrontation that led to the shooting began when police clashed with a protester armed with a steel pipe. The government and the OPP maintained that there was no political involvement in the shooting, but inside the Legislature where parliamentary privilege outweighs any civil claims, several opposition politicians suggested that the attack may have been ordered by the premier&#x27;s office, and called for an independent judicial inquiry. In a court case that went to the Supreme Court of Canada, Deane maintained that he was not under orders to shoot and was convicted of criminal negligence causing death. An inquiry, headed by commissioner Justice Sidney Linden, was called after the government of Dalton McGuinty was elected in 2003.

On November 28, 2005, former-attorney general Charles Harnick testified before the Ipperwash Inquiry that Harris had shouted &quot;I want the fucking Indians out of the park&quot; at a meeting with Ontario Provincial Police officer Ron Fox, hours before the shooting occurred (&quot;Canadian Press&quot;, 28 November 2005). Other witnesses have disputed this account, and Harris himself denied it in his testimony on 14 February 2006 at the inquiry.

According to the Ontario Court of Justice history project, the Ipperwash Inquiry &quot;found that the OPP, the provincial government led by Premier Mike Harris, and the federal government all bore responsibility for the events that led to George&#x27;s death. The report also called on the federal government to issue a public apology and return Camp Ipperwash – along with compensation – to the Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation.&quot; In Volume 1 of the report it was noted that, Premier Harris&#x27;s &quot;comments&quot; and &quot;generally the speed at which he wished to end the occupation of Ipperwash Park, created an atmosphere that unduly narrowed the scope of the government&#x27;s response to the Aboriginal occupation.&quot;
The Premier&#x27;s determination to seek a quick resolution closed off many options endorsed by civil servants in the Ontario government, including process negotiations, the appointment of mediators, and opening up communication with the First Nations people. His narrow approach to the occupation did not enable the situation to stabilize at the park.
In spite of his denials, the inquiry found that Harris did say &quot;I want the fucking Indians out of the park.&quot; This finding was based on not being able to find an existing animosity from Harnick towards Harris and the fact that Harnick was reversing previous statements that he had made in the legislature which would not be of any benefit to himself.

===Federal politics speculation===

During his time as premier, Harris was frequently cited as someone who could &quot;unite the right&quot; in Canada, and lead a merged party of federal Progressive Conservatives and Reform/Canadian Alliance supporters. He made serious steps toward a career in federal politics after stepping down as Premier, weighing in on issues such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq (which he supported) and the value of the Canadian dollar (which he wanted to see increase in relation to the American dollar). 

In late 2003, he made a speech in Halifax which many believed was the unofficial launch of a campaign to lead the new Conservative Party of Canada. In the end, Harris decided to stand aside. He later endorsed former Magna International president and CEO Belinda Stronach in the 2004 leadership election. Harris was reportedly active in helping Stornach fundraise for her campaign. 

After the federal Conservatives&#x27; loss in the 2021 Canadian federal election, Harris urged the party to &quot;unite behind&quot; the leader, Erin O&#x27;Toole, through a column of his in the newspaper, Toronto Sun.

<text>Charles Michael Schuldiner (May 13, 1967 – December 13, 2001) was an American musician. He cofounded the pioneering Florida death metal band Death in 1983, in which he was the guitarist, primary songwriter and only continuous member until his death in 2001. He became the lead vocalist in 1985 after original drummer and vocalist Kam Lee left the band. His obituary in the January 5, 2002, issue of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; described him as &quot;one of the most significant figures in the history of metal.&quot; Schuldiner was ranked No. 10 in Joel McIver&#x27;s book &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists&quot; in 2009 and No. 20 in March 2004 &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists&quot;. In 1987, Schuldiner founded the publishing company Mutilation Music, affiliated with performance rights organization BMI. Schuldiner died in 2001 of a brain tumor.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Charles Michael Schuldiner was born on May 13, 1967, on Long Island, New York. His father Mal Schuldiner was Jewish and the son of Austrian immigrants, and his mother Jane Schuldiner was from the American South and had converted to Judaism. He had two siblings, Beth and Frank Schuldiner.

In 1968, his family moved to Florida. The area was relatively undeveloped, and Schuldiner spent much of his time playing with his siblings in the wooded areas around his house. He became interested in art, music and sculpting at an early age, and started playing guitar at the age of nine. It was at this age that his older brother, Frank, was killed in a car accident. Schuldiner, who was very close with his brother, &quot;never really came to terms with&quot; the latter&#x27;s passing, according to his mother. Schuldiner&#x27;s parents bought him an acoustic guitar to help him cope with the grieving process. Schuldiner quickly grew bored of guitar lessons, and found more interest in playing the electric guitar. According to his mother, &quot;From the first time he played the electric guitar it was as if a switch was turned on in him and it never turned off&quot;.

Schuldiner was originally inspired by Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, and classical jazz, among a wide range of other influences he was exposed to through his parents. He was particularly interested in the metal movement known as NWOBHM – New Wave of British Heavy Metal – and cited bands of that genre among his favorites. He frequently cited French band Sortilège as his personal favorite metal group. Schuldiner cited progressive metal bands such as Watchtower, and Queensrÿche as influences in a 1991 interview, as well as Kiss and Coroner. Metallica, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Mercyful Fate and Raven were among the bands that he claimed as influences in a 1993 interview. The official Schuldiner website, Empty Words, quotes Schuldiner&#x27;s mother making the claim that he enjoyed all forms of music except country and rap.

Schuldiner&#x27;s mother said he formed his first band in the family&#x27;s garage a few years after his brother&#x27;s death. She stated he played his first live show at age 15 in a park near the family&#x27;s residence in Altamonte Springs, Florida.

Schuldiner performed well in school before becoming bored with education and eventually dropping out. He later regretted this decision. He has stated that if he had not become a musician, he would have liked to have become a veterinarian or a cook.

===Musical career===
Taking inspiration from Nasty Savage, Schuldiner formed Mantas (which he later renamed Death) in 1983 when he was 16 years old. He played guitar in the band, while Rick Rozz was on guitar and Kam Lee played the drums and performed the vocals. In January 1986, Schuldiner moved to Toronto and temporarily joined the Canadian band Slaughter. However, he quickly returned to continue the formation of Death.

Death underwent many lineup changes. With Chris Reifert, Schuldiner eventually released the first Death album, titled &quot;Scream Bloody Gore&quot;, in 1987. He continued with 1988&#x27;s &quot;Leprosy&quot; with the line-up of former Mantas guitarist Rick Rozz and rhythm section Terry Butler on bass and Bill Andrews on drums, and 1990&#x27;s &quot;Spiritual Healing&quot;, where guitarist James Murphy had replaced the fired Rozz in 1989.

After &quot;Spiritual Healing&quot;, Schuldiner stopped working with full-time band members, preferring to work with studio and live venue musicians, due to bad relationships with Death&#x27;s previous rhythm section and guitarists. This earned Schuldiner something of a &#x27;perfectionist&#x27; reputation in the metal community. Schuldiner had also fired his manager Eric Greif but settled and re-hired him before the recording of his next, influential release.

Death&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;Human&quot; saw the band evolving to a more technical and progressive style, in which Schuldiner displayed his guitar skills more than ever. He continued in this style (and continued the success of the band) with 1993&#x27;s &quot;Individual Thought Patterns&quot;, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Symbolic.&quot; He announced the following year that he had broken up Death and would focus on his new progressive metal band, Control Denied.

Schuldiner also played guitar in the supergroup Voodoocult on the album &quot;Jesus Killing Machine&quot; in 1994 and played a guest solo on Naphobia&#x27;s 1995 release, &quot;Of Hell&quot; on the track &quot;As Ancients Evolve&quot; as a favor to the band&#x27;s bassist at the time who was a friend of Schuldiner&#x27;s. Schuldiner played lead guitar on a tribute track to Randy Rhoads called Hardly A Day Goes By with his Control Denied bandmates Chris Williams on drums, and Scott Clendenin on bass, as well as Craig Sease on vocals.

He secured a record deal with Nuclear Blast in 1997, but the label required that he release another Death album before Control Denied. As a result, &quot;The Sound of Perseverance&quot; was released in 1998, followed by the Control Denied album &quot;The Fragile Art of Existence&quot; the next year. Control Denied also had other players from the latest Death album but featured Tim Aymar, a melodic metal vocalist, as well as DiGiorgio. In a 1999 interview, Schuldiner spoke about why he didn&#x27;t sing on the Control Denied album &quot;The Fragile Art of Existence&quot; &quot;...these vocals are all I ever wanted to do in Death but couldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve had this dream of recording like that for years, and it seems like a dream come true. Tim Aymar is an amazing singer and this is the main difference.&quot;

Schuldiner was also asked to be one of the many guest vocalists on Dave Grohl&#x27;s 2001 Probot. Grohl, Napalm Death, Ozzy Osbourne, and Anthrax all increased efforts to raise funds for Schuldiner&#x27;s medical bills.

===Illness and death===
Schuldiner had experienced &quot;extreme neck pain&quot; in early 1999 and was diagnosed with pontine glioma that May, on his 32nd birthday. Doctors said that the tumor had existed since his childhood, and he had shown no signs or symptoms prior to his diagnosis. He had surgery in New York City in January 2000, which removed half of the tumor.

He continued his work with Control Denied. In May 2001, it was announced that Schuldiner&#x27;s cancer had reappeared. He was at first unable to afford the surgery that he needed immediately. A press release called for support from everyone, including fellow artists. Jane Schuldiner urged all who read the statements about Schuldiner and his illness to obtain health insurance, stating her frustration in the American healthcare system. Schuldiner had taken out medical insurance after his first surgery, but the insurer had refused to pay because the cancer pre-dated insurance being taken out. Many artists, including Kid Rock, Korn and Red Hot Chili Peppers, got together during the summer of 2001 to auction off personal items, with the funds assisting Schuldiner&#x27;s medical expenses, an effort covered by MTV. The auction was poorly managed and only a small amount of money was received by the Schuldiners. Matt Heafy, vocalist and guitarist for Trivium, has stated that at the age of 15 his band had played a benefit show for Schuldiner while he was in the hospital in their days as a local band. Other artists that supported Schuldiner during this time include Dave Grohl, Napalm Death, Ozzy Osbourne, and Anthrax.

The cancer ultimately spread to parts of Schuldiner&#x27;s brain that were said to be &quot;too sensitive for surgery&quot;. Despite this, he continued to write music as his condition worsened. According to his mother, &quot;He drove himself unmercifully that last year [...] We worried so much about him and begged him to rest. As the perfectionist he is, he said [the music] was &quot;just OK&quot; and that wasn’t good enough for him or his fans. He would go on until he couldn’t anymore, and he really mourned that he couldn’t finish it.&quot; Control Denied drummer Richard Christy said &quot;It was inspiring to see somebody going through something so hard and still playing guitar and writing music. Chuck was just so committed. He gave it everything he had.&quot;

By December 2001, Tim Aymar stated that &quot;Chuck is in very bad shape.&quot; During this time, Schuldiner was in hospice under the care of his mother. On the afternoon of December 13, 2001, Schuldiner died at the age of 34 due to complications from cancer. According to his mother, &quot;At the end he thanked me for the golden memories of his childhood.&quot; In the weeks following his death, his website was reportedly &quot;flooded&quot; with over 14,000 messages from fans paying tribute. Schuldiner was cremated.

===Aftermath and estate===

Former manager Eric Greif handled Schuldiner&#x27;s estate as president of Perseverance Holdings. Beth Schuldiner has a son named Christopher Steele, who also plays guitar and inherited all of Schuldiner&#x27;s guitars.

A legal battle began from the time of Schuldiner&#x27;s death on the settlement of the rights to the partially completed second Control Denied album, &quot;When Man and Machine Collide&quot;, which was recorded in 2000–2001. Demos of these unreleased Control Denied songs, as well as early Death demos and live Death recordings from 1990, were released in the &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; two-part compilation bootlegs by the Dutch Hammerheart Holdings company. The matter was settled in November 2009. There was a meeting held by guitarist Shannon Hamm and producer Jim Morris at Morrisound in 2012. By 2016, former Death manager Eric Greif indicated that the album would not be completed.

Tribute concerts have been coordinated or funded by Schuldiner&#x27;s mother and family and various Death tribute groups internationally. Former CKY frontman, Deron Miller, who considers Schuldiner an idol of his, got the idea, while working on various projects with former Death guitarist (and pituitary tumor survivor) James Murphy, to do a tribute album. Murphy announced he would release a Chuck Schuldiner tribute album to commemorate his lasting mark on the metal community and Schuldiner&#x27;s family publicly offered support for Murphy&#x27;s effort, though it has never materialized. In December 2022, Murphy talked about the reasoning why the project was placed on hold. Schuldiner&#x27;s sister Beth confirmed via her YouTube channel that &quot;Death: Live in Japan&quot;, a behind the scenes Death video, as well as a potential boxset containing all of Schuldiner&#x27;s works including some exclusive copies of handwritten notes by Schuldiner are in the works via Relapse Records. The Live in Japan release was cancelled as it was planned without the &quot;knowledge&quot; of Chuck&#x27;s estate. Schuldiner estate lawyer Eric Greif held a charity Chuck Schuldiner Birthday Bash in Calgary, Alberta, May 13, 2011, featuring speeches by Greif and former Death guitarist Paul Masvidal, as well as bands performing Schuldiner&#x27;s music.

Schuldiner&#x27;s mother Jane and sister Beth Schuldiner continue to interact with his fans. Jane Schuldiner told Guitar World in 2006, &quot;I receive many emails from young fans 11 years old and up. Just think, another generation is discovering Chuck’s music. He would be so proud.&quot;

==Artistry==
Ultimately, Chuck Schuldiner&#x27;s vocals are characterized as a &quot;throat shredding death rattle.&quot; In the early days of Death, he employed a &quot;deep, raspy&quot; death growl vocal technique, which his mother claims &quot;just came naturally&quot; with playing aggressive music. Sam Sodomsky of Pitchfork described Schuldiner&#x27;s vocal tone as &quot;less guttural than what death metal vocals would become and more abrasive than the thrash metal that inspired him [...] like fire tearing through piles of leaves.&quot; Joe DiVita of Loudwire assessed, &quot;Early on, his ravenous approach was biting and mid-ranged, arcing with eviscerating highs that have been imitated by countless others [...] Later on, Schuldiner’s voice would become even more intelligible, marked by higher tones.&quot; Schuldiner said in 1993 that &quot;it takes a lot of energy and a lot of throat abuse to get through a show.&quot;

By 1999, he emphasized that he would retire Death if Control Denied &quot;took off&quot;, stating that &quot;I hate screaming. I just don&#x27;t like it any more.&quot;

Schuldiner&#x27;s lyrics on early Death releases drew on slasher film-style graphic violence. On later releases by the band, his lyrics evolved towards a more progressive and philosophical style, characterized by &quot;thought-provoking messages&quot;. Schuldiner explained that he had grown tired of the usual Satanic and horror-themed lyrical content of his contemporaries in the genre, and expressed a desire to explore &quot;real life horrors&quot; in his lyrics. To quash any implication of religion, Schuldiner adjusted the original Death logo (which was designed by the original vocalist and drummer, Kam Lee), swapping the inverted cross with a regular &quot;T&quot; in 1991.

Schuldiner was mostly self-taught as a guitarist. In 1993, he expressed a disinterest in music theory: &quot;I know enough about what I&#x27;m playing to memorize the scales and things, but I have no idea how you would label them. As long as I can play it, memorize it and apply it, I don&#x27;t need to know what you call it.&quot; His style was described by Control Denied drummer Christy as a &quot;mix of melody, technicality and brutality&quot;. His guitar solos have been called &quot;emotionally aching&quot; and have been noted for their high pitch. 

Schuldiner cited Metallica, Mercyful Fate, Anvil, and Exciter as influences. Additionally, he was heavily influenced by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal.

Schuldiner has been described as a &quot;perfectionist&quot; by some who had known him and worked with him.

== Equipment ==
Schuldiner used a simple setup. For most of his career, his main guitar was a B.C. Rich Stealth fitted with a single DiMarzio X2N bridge pickup. For his amplification, Schuldiner used a Marshall Valvestate 8100 head played through a Marshall Valvestate VS412 cabinet. He used 10-46 gauge GHS Boomers strings, and Dunlop Tortex Standard .88mm picks. Schuldiner used very little effects except for a chorus effect during his solos.

==Legacy==
Schuldiner is often referred to as &quot;The Godfather of death metal&quot;. Forbes said &quot;Extreme music, more specifically the death metal sub-genre, would cease to exist without the musical brilliance of Chuck Schuldiner&quot; [...] within metal, there are few musicians who’ve shown such a profound prowess for technical and melodic guitar playing, all while playing music as extreme as death metal.&quot; Bradley Torreano of AllMusic said &quot;Chuck Schuldiner&#x27;s brand of heavy metal opened the doors for a genre that had only been hinted at by efforts from Slayer and Venom.&quot;

Schuldiner himself was not fond of the title, remarking that &quot;I don&#x27;t think I should take the credits for this death metal stuff. I&#x27;m just a guy from a band, and I think Death is a metal band.&quot; He instead contended that Venom and Motörhead were the true progenitors of the style.

Schuldiner has also been credited with pushing the boundaries of death metal and influencing the development of several subgenres. According to Blabbermouth, Schuldiner &quot;[spawned] a new generation of metallers open to the concept that brutality and melody could work together [...] there aren&#x27;t too many other individual musicians in metal&#x27;s history who did more to kick down those genre walls and make it okay to be unique.&quot; Jonathan Horsley of MusicRadar said &quot;Schuldiner’s vision proved death metal could grow its brain and process high-minded concepts without taking all the danger out of the sound,&quot; and proved the genre &quot;could tackle philosophical issues, too.&quot; He has been called one of the &quot;best&quot; lyricists in the history of the genre.

In January 2001, Mahyar Dean, an Iranian metal guitarist/musician, wrote &quot;&quot;, a book about Death and Schuldiner&#x27;s poems. The book includes bilingual lyrics and many articles about the band. The book was sent through the site keepers of emptywords.org to Schuldiner, who in his words was &quot;truly blown away and honored by the obvious work and devotion he put into bringing the book to life&quot;.

==Personal life==
Schuldiner&#x27;s father is Jewish, and his mother is a Christian. According to his mother, as parents, they exposed him to the cultural traditions of both religious backgrounds, and him and his brother &quot;ended up being the best of both&quot;.

Schuldiner was also openly against hard drugs; he is quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve tripped several times. That&#x27;s all because I don&#x27;t like the hard drugs. And my only drugs are alcohol and grass.&quot;

Despite the grim nature of his band, Schuldiner has been quoted as saying he&#x27;s &quot;a lover of life... friendship, and animals&quot; and that &quot;I would like to live forever if it were possible&quot;.

<text>Rūm ( , collective; singulative: Rūmī ; plural: Arwām ; Rum or Rumiyān, singular Rumi; or , singular ), also romanized as &quot;Roum&quot;, is a derivative of Parthian (&quot;frwm&quot;) terms, ultimately derived from Greek Ῥωμαῖοι (&quot;Rhomaioi&quot;, literally &#x27;Romans&#x27;). Both terms are endonyms of the pre-Islamic inhabitants of Anatolia, the Middle East and the Balkans and date to when those regions were parts of the Eastern Roman Empire.

The term &quot;Rūm&quot; is now used to describe: 

*The city of Rome in Italy, and the people living in it.
* Remaining pre-Islamic ethnocultural Christian minorities living in the Near East and their descendants, notably the Antiochian Greek Christians who are members of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and the Melkite Greek Catholic Church of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, and the Hatay Province in Southern Turkey whose liturgy is still based on Koine Greek.
* Orthodox Christian citizens of modern Turkey originating in the pre-Islamic peoples of the country, including Pontians from the Black Sea mountains in the north, Cappadocians from Turkey&#x27;s central plateau, and Hayhurum from eastern Turkey.
* Topographical names within Anatolia (e.g. Erzurum and Rumiye-i Suğra) and the Balkans (Rumelia) stemming from the legacy of the Eastern Roman Empire in those areas, or of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, a medieval Muslim state that ruled over recently conquered Byzantines (Rûm) in central Asia Minor from 1077 to 1308.
==Origins==
The term &quot;Rūm&quot; in Arabic and New Persian was derived from Middle Persian &quot;hrōm&quot;, which had in turn derived from Parthian &quot;frwm&quot;, which was used to label &quot;Rome&quot; and the &quot;Roman Empire&quot; and was derived from the Greek &quot;Ῥώμη&quot;. The Armenian and Georgian forms of the name were also derived from Aramaic and Parthian. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot;, Rūm is a Persian and Turkish word used to refer to the Byzantine Empire.

===Inscriptions===
The Greek (&quot;Ῥώμη&quot;), Middle Persian (&quot;hrōm&quot;), Parthian (&quot;frwm&quot;) versions of &quot;Rūm&quot; are found on the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht, a monument declaring Shapur I&#x27;s victory over Marcus Antonius Gordianus. The inscriptions on the Ka&#x27;ba-ye Zartosht date from around 262 AD.

&quot;Rûm&quot; is found in the pre-Islamic Namara inscription and later in the Quran (7th century) in which it is used to refer to the contemporary Eastern Roman Empire under its Greek-speaking emperors (the Heraclian dynasty). The empire was the most prominent Christian state during the period of Muhammad&#x27;s life and during the composition of the Quran, the Western Roman Empire having fallen two centuries earlier, during the 5th century.
The Qur&#x27;an includes &quot;Ar-Rum&quot;, the sura dealing with &quot;the Romans&quot;, which is sometimes translated as &quot;The Byzantines&quot; to reflect a term that is now used in the West. The Romans of the 7th century, who are referred to as Byzantines in modern Western scholarship, were the inhabitants of the surviving Eastern Roman Empire. Since all ethnic groups in the Roman empire had been granted citizenship by 212 AD, the eastern peoples had come to label themselves &quot;Ρωμιοί&quot; or &quot;Ῥωμαῖοι&quot; (Romioi or Romaioi, Romans) by using the word for Roman citizen in the eastern lingua franca of Koine Greek. The citizenship label became روم &quot;Rūm&quot; in Arabic. To designate the inhabitants of the western city of Rome, the Arabs use instead the word رومان Rūmān or sometimes لاتينيون &quot;Lātīniyyūn&quot; (Latins), and to designate European Greek speakers, the term يونانيون &quot;Yūnāniyyūn&quot; is used (from يونان &quot;Yūnān&quot; (Ionia), the name for Greece). The word &quot;Byzantine&quot;, which is now used by Western historians to describe the Eastern Roman Empire and its Greek lingua franca, was not used anywhere at the time.

The Roman and later Eastern Roman (Byzantine) state encompassed the entirety of the eastern Mediterranean for six centuries, but after the advent of Islam in Arabia in the 7th century and during the subsequent Islamic conquest of what is now Syria, Egypt and Libya in the 7th and the 8th centuries AD, the Byzantine state shrank to consist only of Anatolia and the Balkans in the Middle Ages. The Seljuks of the Sultanate of Rum took their name from &quot;ar-Rum&quot;, the word for the Romans in the Qu&#x27;ran. During the early Renaissance (15th century) the Byzantine state finally fell to the Muslim Turkic conquerors, who had begun migrating into what is now Turkey from Central Asia from the 12th to the 14th centuries. Thus, during the Middle Ages, the Arabs called the native inhabitants of what is now Turkey, the Balkans, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine &quot;Rûm&quot; (literally Romans but in modern historiography often called Byzantines), called what is now Turkey and the Balkans &quot;the land of the Rûm&quot; and referred to the Mediterranean as &quot;the Sea of the Rûm&quot;.

After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman Turkish conqueror Sultan Mehmed II declared himself to have replaced the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) ruler as the new Kayser-i Rum, literally &quot;Caesar of the Romans&quot;. In the Ottoman millet system, the conquered natives of Turkey and the Balkans were now categorized as the &quot;Rum Millet&quot; (Millet-i Rum) for taxation purposes and were allowed to continue practicing Orthodox Christianity, the religion that had been promulgated by the former Byzantine state. In modern Turkey &quot;Rum&quot; is still used to denote the Orthodox Christian native minority of Turkey, together with its pre-conquest remnant institutions such as the &quot;Rum Ortodoks Patrikhanesi&quot;, the Turkish designation of the Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the figurehead for all of Orthodox Christianity and former religious leader of the Eastern Roman state.

==In geography==

Muslim contact with the Byzantine Empire most often took place in Asia Minor, the bulk of which is now in Turkey, since it was the heartland of the Byzantine state from the early Middle Ages onward and so the term &quot;Rûm&quot; became fixed there geographically. The term remained even after the conquest of what is now central Turkey in the late Middle Ages by Seljuk Turks, who were migrating from Central Asia. Thus, the Turks called their new state the Sultanate of Rûm, the &quot;Sultanate of the Rome.&quot;

After the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, the area was called Rumelia (Roman lands) as it was predominantly inhabited by the newly conquered-nation, which the Ottomans called &quot;Rûm&quot;.

==As a name==
&quot;Al-Rūmī&quot; is a nisbah that designates people originating in the Eastern Roman Empire or lands that formerly belonged to it, especially those that are now called Turkey. Historical people so designated include the following:
* Suhayb ar-Rumi, a companion of Muhammad
* Harithah bint al-Muammil (Zunairah al-Rumiya), a companion of Muhammad
* Rumi a moniker for Mawlānā Jalāl-ad-Dīn Muhammad Balkhī, the 13th-century Persian poet who lived most of his life amongst the conquered Rûm (Byzantines) of Konya (Byzantine Greek: Ἰκόνιον or Ikonio) in the Sultanate of Rûm
* Qāḍī Zāda al-Rūmī, 14th-century mathematician
* Tadj ol-Molouk Ayrumlu, Former Queen of Iran 

The Greek surname &quot;Roumeliotis&quot; stems from the word &quot;Rûm&quot; borrowed by Ottomans.

==Other uses==
During the 16th century, the Portuguese used &quot;rume&quot; and &quot;rumes&quot; (plural) as a generic term to refer to the Mamluk-Ottoman forces that they faced in the Indian Ocean.

The term &quot;Urums&quot;, also derived from the same origin, is still used in contemporary ethnography to denote Turkic-speaking Greek populations. &quot;Rumeika&quot; is a Greek dialect identified mainly with the Ottoman Greeks.

The Chinese during the Ming dynasty referred to the Ottomans as &quot;Lumi&quot; (魯迷), derived from &quot;Rum&quot; or &quot;Rumi&quot;. The Chinese also referred to Rum as &quot;Wulumu&quot; 務魯木 during the Qing dynasty. The modern Mandarin Chinese name for the city of Rome is &quot;Luoma&quot; (羅馬).

Among the Muslim aristocracy of South Asia, the fez is known as the &quot;Rumi Topi&quot; (which means &quot;hat of Rome or Byzantium&quot;). 

Non-Ottoman Muslims in the classical period called the Ottomans Rumis because of the Byzantine legacy that was inherited by the Ottoman Empire. 

In the Sassanian period (pre-Islamic Persia), the word &quot;Hrōmāy-īg&quot; (Middle Persian) meant &quot;Roman&quot; or &quot;Byzantine&quot; and was derived from the Byzantine Greek word &quot;Rhomaioi&quot;.

The Latin alphabet used for Malay is endonymically called &quot;tulisan Rumi&quot; (lit. &#x27;Roman writing&#x27;).

<doc id="293605" wikidata="Q678545" url="?curid=293605" title="House of Representatives of the Philippines">
<text>The House of Representatives (; &quot;,&quot; thus commonly referred to as Kamara) is the lower house of Congress, the bicameral legislature of the Philippines, with the Senate of the Philippines as the upper house. The lower house is commonly referred to as Congress, although the term collectively refers to both houses.

Members of the House are officially styled as &quot;representatives&quot; () and are sometimes informally called &quot;congressmen&quot; or &quot;congresswomen&quot; (). They are elected to a three-year term and can be re-elected, but cannot serve more than three consecutive terms without an interruption of one term (e.g. serving one term in the Senate &quot;ad interim&quot;). Around 80% of congressmen are district representatives, representing specific geographical areas. The 19th Congress has 253 congressional districts. Party-list representatives, who make up not more than twenty percent of the total number of representatives, are elected through the party-list system.

Aside from needing its agreement to every bill before it is sent to the president for signature to become law, the House of Representatives has the power to impeach certain officials and all franchise and money bills must originate from the lower house.

The House of Representatives is headed by the House speaker (). The position is currently held by Martin Romualdez. The speaker of the House is third in the Philippine presidential line of succession, after the vice president and the Senate president. The official headquarters of the House of Representatives is at the &quot;Batasang Pambansa&quot; (literally &quot;national legislature&quot;) located in Batasan Hills, Quezon City. The building is often simply called &quot;Batasan&quot;, and the word has also become a metonym to refer to the House of Representatives.

==History==

=== Malolos Congress ===

The Philippine legislative system began in a unicameral form of government in 1898 when then President Emilio Aguinaldo established the Malolos Congress of the short-lived 1st Republic of the Philippines from 1898 to 1901. The Congress’ notable achievement was the ratification of Philippine Independence when it was declared on June 12, 1898, in Kawit, Cavite.

The Malolos Congress’ convened at the Barasoain church during the subsequent inauguration of Emilio Aguinaldo and the inauguration of the Malolos Constitution in 1898. A year prior to the establishment of the republic, the Congress approved the motion to declare war on the United States, thus beginning the Philippine-American War which lasted from 1899 to 1901. The Malolos Congress was dissolved on April 1, 1901, following Aguinaldo&#x27;s declaration of allegiance to the United States when he was captured.

===Philippine Assembly===
At the beginning of American colonial rule, from March 16, 1900, the sole national legislative body was the Philippine Commission with all members appointed by the President of the United States. Headed by the Governor-General of the Philippines the body exercised all legislative authority given to it by the President and the United States Congress until October 1907 when it was joined by the Philippine Assembly. William Howard Taft was chosen to be the first American civilian Governor-General and the first leader of this Philippine Commission, which subsequently became known as the Taft Commission.

The Philippine Bill of 1902, a basic law, or organic act, of the Insular Government, mandated that once certain conditions were met a bicameral, or two-chamber, Philippine Legislature would be created with the previously existing, all-appointed Philippine Commission as the upper house and the Philippine Assembly as the lower house. This bicameral legislature was inaugurated in October 1907. Under the leadership of Speaker Sergio Osmeña and Floor Leader Manuel L. Quezon, the Rules of the 59th United States Congress was substantially adopted as the Rules of the Philippine Legislature. Osmeña and Quezon led the Nacionalista Party, with a platform of independence from the United States, into successive electoral victories against the Progresista Party and later the Democrata Party, which first advocated United States statehood, then opposed immediate independence.

It is this body, founded as the Philippine Assembly, that would continue in one form or another, and with a few different names, up until the present day.

===Jones Act of 1916===
In 1916, the Jones Act, officially the Philippine Autonomy Act, changed the legislative system. The Philippine Commission was abolished and a new fully elected, bicameral Philippine Legislature consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate was established. The Nacionalistas continued their electoral dominance at this point, although they were split into two factions led by Osmeña and Quezon; the two reconciled in 1924, and controlled the Assembly via a virtual dominant-party system.

===Commonwealth and the Third Republic===
The legislative system was changed again in 1935. The 1935 Constitution established a unicameral National Assembly. But in 1940, through an amendment to the 1935 Constitution, a bicameral Congress of the Philippines consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate was adopted.

Upon the inauguration of the Republic of the Philippines in 1946, Republic Act No. 6 was enacted providing that on the date of the proclamation of the Republic of the Philippines, the existing Congress would be known as the First Congress of the Republic. The &quot;Liberal bloc&quot; of the Nacionalistas permanently split from their ranks, creating the Liberal Party. These two will contest all of the elections in what appeared to be a two-party system. The party of the ruling president wins the elections in the House of Representatives; in cases where the party of the president and the majority of the members of the House of Representatives are different, a sufficient number will break away and join the party of the president, thereby ensuring that the president will have control of the House of Representatives.

===Martial Law===

This set up continued until President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law and abolished Congress. He would rule by decree even after the 1973 Constitution abolished the bicameral Congress and created a unicameral &quot;Batasang Pambansa&quot; parliamentary system of government, as parliamentary election would not occur in 1978. Marcos&#x27; Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL; New Society Movement) won all of the seats except those from the Central Visayas ushering in an era of KBL dominance, which continued until the People Power Revolution overthrew Marcos in 1986.

===1987 Constitution===
The 1987 Constitution restored the presidential system of government together with a bicameral Congress of the Philippines. One deviation from the previous setup was the introduction of the mid-term election; however, the dynamics of the House of Representatives resumed its pre-1972 state, with the party of the president controlling the chamber, although political pluralism ensued that prevented the restoration of the old Nacionalista-Liberal two-party system. Instead, a multi-party system evolved.

Corazon Aquino who nominally had no party, supported the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP; Struggle of the Democratic Filipinos). With the victory of Fidel V. Ramos in the 1992 presidential election, many representatives defected to his Lakas-NUCD party; the same would happen with Joseph Estrada&#x27;s victory in 1998, but he lost support when he was ousted after the 2001 EDSA Revolution that brought his vice president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to power. This also meant the restoration of Lakas-NUCD as the top party in the chamber. The same would happen when Benigno Aquino III won in 2010, which returned the Liberals into power.

The presiding officer is the Speaker. Unlike the Senate President, the Speaker usually serves the entire term of Congress, although there had been instances when the Speaker left office due to conflict with the president: examples include Jose de Venecia Jr.&#x27;s resignation as speaker in 2008 when his son Joey de Venecia exposed alleged corrupt practices by First Gentleman Mike Arroyo, and Manny Villar&#x27;s ouster occurred after he allowed the impeachment of President Estrada in 2000.

== Electoral system ==
The Philippines uses parallel voting for its lower house elections. For the 2022 elections, there will be 316 seats in the House; 253 of these are district representatives, and 63 are party-list representatives. The number of seats to be disputed may change depending on the creation of new congressional districts.

Philippine law mandates that there should be one party-list representative for every four district representatives. District representatives are elected under the plurality voting system from single-member districts. Party-list representatives are elected via the nationwide vote with a 2% election threshold, with a party winning not more than three seats. The party with the most votes usually wins three seats, then the other parties with more than 2% of the vote two seats. At this point, if all of the party-list seats are not filled up, the parties with less than 2% of the vote will win one seat each until all party-list seats are filled up.

Political parties competing in the party-list election are barred from participating district elections, and vice versa, unless permitted by the Commission on Elections. Party-lists and political parties participating in the district elections may forge coalition deals with one another.

Campaigning for elections from congressional districts seats are decidedly local; the candidates are most likely a part of an election slate that includes candidates for other positions in the locality, and slates may comprise different parties. The political parties contesting the election make no attempt to create a national campaign.

Party-list campaigning, on the other hand, is done on a national scale. Parties usually attempt to appeal to a specific demographic. Polling is usually conducted for the party-list election, while pollsters may release polls on specific district races. In district elections, pollsters do not attempt to make forecasts on how many votes a party would achieve, nor the number of seats a party would win; they do attempt to do that in party-list elections, though.

==Officers==
The members of the House of Representatives who are also its officers are also &quot;ex officio&quot; members of all of the committees and have a vote.

The leadership positions, except for the Secretary General and Sergeant-at-Arms, are currently vacant. The terms of office of the officers elected during the 18th Congress ended on June 30, 2022. On July 25, 2022, the 19th Congress of the Philippines shall elect among themselves their leaders.

===Speaker===

The speaker is the head of the House of Representatives. He presides over the session; decides on all questions of order, subject to appeal by any member; signs all acts, resolutions, memorials, writs, warrants, and subpoenas issued by or upon order of the House; appoints, suspends, dismisses, or disciplines House personnel; and exercise administrative functions.

The speaker is elected by a majority of all the members of the House, including vacant seats. The speaker is traditionally elected at the convening of each congress. Before a speaker is elected, the House&#x27;s sergeant-at-arms sits as the &quot;Presiding Officer&quot; until a speaker is elected. Compared to the Senate President, the unseating of an incumbent speaker is rarer.

The incumbent Speaker of the House is Congressman Martin Romualdez who represents Leyte&#x27;s 1st Congressional district and the first cousin of incumbent president Bongbong Marcos.

===Deputy Speakers===

There was a position of speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; for congresses prior the reorganization of the officers of the House of Representatives during the 10th Congress in 1995. The speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; was the next highest position in the House after the speaker.

The position was replaced by deputy speakers in 1995. Originally, there was one Deputy Speaker for each island group of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Then, in 2001 during the 12th Congress, a Deputy Speaker &quot;at large&quot; was created. In the next Congress, another &quot;at large&quot; deputy speakership was created, along with a Deputy Speaker for women. In the 15th Congress starting in 2010, all six deputy speakers are &quot;at large&quot;.

In the 16th Congress, the deputy speakers represent the chamber at-large. Starting in the 17th Congress, each region is represented by a Deputy Speaker, with additional deputy speakers from the party-list ranks.

The deputy speakers perform the speaker&#x27;s role when the speaker is absent. In case in the resignation of the speaker, the deputy speakers shall elect from among themselves an acting speaker, until a speaker is elected.

The outgoing deputy speakers of the House are former president and speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Congressman Raymond Democrito Mendoza, Congressman Roberto Puno, Congresswoman Kristine Singson-Meehan, Congressman Isidro Ungab, Congresswoman Camille Villar, former Senator and outgoing Congressman Ralph Recto, Congressman Aurelio Gonzales Jr., and Congressman Vincent Franco-Frasco.

===Majority Floor Leader===

The majority leader, aside from being the spokesman of the majority party, is to direct the deliberations on the floor. The Majority Leader is also concurrently the Chairman of the Committee on Rules. The majority leader is elected in a party caucus of the ruling majority party.

The incumbent House Majority Floor Leader is Congressman Manuel Jose Dalipe, a member of the Lakas–CMD party and is representing Zamboanga City&#x27;s second congressional district.

===Minority Floor Leader===

The minority leader is the spokesman of the minority party in the House and is an &quot;ex-officio&quot; member of all standing Committees. The minority leader is elected in party caucus of all Members of the House in the minority party, although by tradition, the losing candidate for speaker is named the minority leader.

The incumbent House Minority Leader is Congressman Marcelino Libanan, a party-list member for 4PS.

===Secretary General===
The secretary general enforces orders and decisions of the House; keeps the Journal of each session; notes all questions of order, among other things. The secretary general presides over the chamber at the first legislative session after an election, and is elected by a majority of the members.

At present, Reginald S. Velasco is the Secretary General of the House of Representatives.

===Sergeant-at-Arms===
The Sergeant-at-Arms is responsible for the maintenance of public order in the House of Representatives, among other things. Like the Secretary General, the Sergeant-at-Arms is elected by a majority of the members.

At present, retired Police Major General Napoleon C. Taas is the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives.

==Qualifications==
The qualifications for membership in the House are expressly stated in Section 6, Art. VI of the 1987 Philippine Constitution as follows:

*No person shall be a Representative unless he/she is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, and on the day of the election, is at least 25 years of age, able to read and write, a registered voter except for a party-list representative, and a resident of the country for not less than one year immediately preceding the day of the election.
*The age is fixed at 25 and must be possessed on the day of the elections, that is, when the polls are opened and the votes cast, and not on the day of the proclamation of the winners by the board of canvassers.
*With regard to the residence requirements, it was ruled in the case of &quot;Lim v. Pelaez&quot; that it must be the place where one habitually resides and to which he, after absence, has the intention of returning.
*The enumeration laid down by the 1987 Constitution is exclusive under the Latin principle of &quot;expressio unius est exclusio alterius&quot;. This means that Congress cannot anymore add additional qualifications other than those provided by the Constitution.

== Membership ==
There are two types of congressmen: those who represent geographic districts, and those who represent party-lists. The first-past-the-post (simple plurality voting) method is used to determine who represents each of the 243 geographic districts. The party-list representatives are elected via the party-list system. The party-list representatives should always comprise 20% of the seats.

Originally set at 200 in the ordinance of the 1987 constitution, the number of districts has grown to 243. All of the new districts are via created via piecemeal redistricting of the then existing 200 districts, and via the creation of new provinces and cities. The constitution gave Congress to nationally redistrict the country after the release of every census, but this has not been done.

The original 200 districts meant that there should have been 50 party-list representatives. However, the constitution did not give the specifics on how party-list congressmen should have been elected. This led to presidents appointing sectoral representatives, which were then approved by the Commission on Appointments; only a handful of sectoral representatives were seated in this way. With the enactment of the Party-List System Act, the first party-list election was in 1998; with the 2% election threshold, a 3-seat cap and tens of parties participating, this led to only about a fraction of the party-list seats being distributed. Eventually, there had been several Supreme Court decisions changing the way the winning seats are distributed, ensuring that all party-list seats are filled up.

There were supposed to be 245 congressional districts that were to be disputed in the 2019 election, so there were 61 party-list seats contested in the party-list election. Elections in two of these districts were delayed due to its creation right before campaigning. The Supreme Court ruled that one district be contested in the next (2022) election, then the Commission on Elections applied the court&#x27;s ruling to the other district, bringing the number of districts to 243, while still keeping the 61 party-list representatives, for a total of 304 seats.

Vacancies from representatives elected via districts are dealt with special elections, which may be done if the vacancy occurred less than a year before the next regularly-scheduled election. Special elections are infrequently done; despite several vacancies, the last special election was in 2023. For party-list representatives, the nominee next on the list is asked to replace the outgoing representative; if the nominee agrees, then that person would be sworn in as a member, if the nominee doesn&#x27;t agree, then the nominee after that person is asked, and the process is repeated. Vacating party-list representatives have always been replaced this way.

=== Congressional district representation ===

Eighty percent of representatives shall come from congressional districts, with each district returning one representative. The constitution mandates that every province and every city with a population of 250,000 must have at least one representative. Each legislative district, regardless of population, has one congressman. For provinces that have more than one legislative district, the provincial districts are identical to the corresponding legislative district, with the exclusion of cities that do not vote for provincial officials. If cities are divided into multiple districts for city hall representation purposes, these are also used for congressional representation.

The representatives from the districts comprise at most 80% of the members of the House; therefore, for a party to have a majority of seats in the House, the party needs to win a larger majority of district seats. No party since the approval of the 1987 constitution has been able to win a majority of seats, hence coalitions are not uncommon.

=== Party-list representation ===

The party-list system is the name designated for party-list representation. Under the 1987 Constitution, the electorate can vote for certain party-list organizations in order to give voice to significant minorities of society that would otherwise not be adequately represented through geographical district. From 1987 to 1998, party-list representatives were appointed by the President.

Since 1998, each voter votes for a single party-list organization. Organizations that garner at least 2% of the total number of votes are awarded one representative for every 2% up to a maximum of three representatives. Thus, there can be at most 50 party-list representatives in Congress, though usually no more than 20 are elected because many organizations do not reach the required 2% minimum number of votes.

After the 2007 election, in a controversial decision, the Supreme Court ordered the COMELEC to change how it allocates the party-list seats. Under the new formula only one party will have the maximum 3 seats. It based its decision on a formula contained in the &quot;VFP vs. COMELEC&quot; decision. In 2009, in the &quot;BANAT vs. COMELEC&quot; decision, it was changed anew in which parties with less than 2% of the vote were given seats to fulfill the 20% quota as set forth in the constitution.

Aside from determining which party won and allocating the number of seats won per party, another point of contention was whether the nominees should be a member of the marginalized group they are supposed to represent; in the &quot;Ang Bagong Bayani vs. COMELEC&quot; decision, the Supreme Court not only ruled that the nominees should be a member of the marginalized sector, but it also disallowed major political parties from participating in the party-list election. However, on the &quot;BANAT&quot; decision, the court ruled that since the law didn&#x27;t specify who belongs to a marginalized sector, the court allowed anyone to be a nominee as long as the nominee as a member of the &quot;party&quot; (not necessarily the marginalized group the party is supposed to represent).

=== Sectoral representation ===
Prior to the enactment of the Party-list Act, the president, with the advice and consent of the Commission on Appointments, nominated sectoral representatives. These represented various sectors, from labor, peasants, urban poor, the youth, women and cultural communities. Their numbers grew from 15 members in the 8th Congress, to 32 in the 10th Congress.

In the Interim Batasang Pambansa, a sectoral election was held to fill up the sectoral seats of parliament.

===Legislative caretakers===
Under the Republic Act No. 6645 or &quot;An Act Prescribing the Manner of Filling a Vacancy in the Congress of the Philippines&quot;, if a seat was vacated with at most 18 months prior to an election the House of Representatives could request the Commission on Elections to hold a special election to fill in the vacancy. The law does not specify for a mechanism if the seat was vacated within 18 months prior to an election. The House of Representatives through its Speaker customarily appoints a caretaker or legislative liaison officer to fill in the vacancy. The caretaker cannot vote in the name of the district that is being taken care of.

==Redistricting==

Congress is mandated to reapportion the legislative districts within three years following the return of every census. Since its restoration in 1987, Congress has not passed any general apportionment law, despite the publication of six censuses in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2007, 2010 and 2015. The increase in the number of representative districts since 1987 were mostly due to the creation of new provinces, cities, and piecemeal redistricting of certain provinces and cities.

The apportionment of congressional districts is not dependent upon a specially-mandated independent government body, but rather through Republic Acts which are drafted by members of Congress. Therefore, apportionment often can be influenced by political motivations. Incumbent representatives who are not permitted by law to serve after three consecutive terms sometimes resort to dividing their district, or even creating a new province which will be guaranteed a seat, just so that their allies be able to run, while &quot;switching offices&quot; with them. Likewise, politicians whose political fortunes are likely to be jeopardized by any change in district boundaries may delay or even ignore the need for reapportionment.

Since 1987, the creation of some new congressional districts have been met with controversy, especially due to incumbent political clans and their allies benefiting from the new district arrangements. Some of these new congressional districts are tied to the creation of a new province, because such an act necessarily entails the creation of a new congressional district.
* Creation of Davao Occidental, 2013: The rival Cagas and Bautista clans dominate politics in the province of Davao del Sur; their members have been elected as congressional representatives for the first and second districts of the province since 1987. However, the province&#x27;s governorship has been in contest between the two clans in recent years: Claude Bautista, the current governor, was elected in 2013; before that Douglas Cagas served as governor from 2007 to 2013, after succeeding Benjamin Bautista Jr. who served from 2002 to 2007. Supporters of both clans have been subjected to political violence, prompting the police to put the province of Davao del Sur in the election watchlist. The law which created Davao Occidental, Republic Act No. 10360, was co-authored by House Representatives Marc Douglas Cagas IV and Franklin Bautista as House Bill 4451; the creation of the new province is seen as a way to halt the &quot;often violent&quot; political rivalry between the clans by ensuring that the Cagas and Bautista clans have separate domains. 
* Reapportionment of Camarines Sur, 2009: A new congressional district was created within Camarines Sur under Republic Act No. 9716, which resulted in the reduction of the population of the province&#x27;s first district to below the Constitutional ideal of 250,000 inhabitants. The move was seen as a form of political accommodation that would (and ultimately did) prevent two allies of then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo from running in the same district. Rolando Andaya, who was on his third term as congressman for the first district, was appointed Budget Secretary in 2006; his plans to run as representative of the same district in 2010 put him in direct competition with Diosdado Macapagal-Arroyo, the president&#x27;s youngest son, who was also seeking re-election. Then-Senator Noynoy Aquino challenged the constitutionality of the law but the Supreme Court of the Philippines ultimately ruled that the creation of the new district was constitutional.
* Creation of Dinagat Islands, 2007: The separation of Dinagat Islands from Surigao del Norte has further solidified the hold of the Ecleo clan over the impoverished and typhoon-prone area, which remains among the poorest provinces in the country.

===Most populous legislative districts===
Currently the district with the lowest population is the lone district of Batanes, with only 18,831 inhabitants in 2020. The most populous congressional district, the 1st District of Rizal, has around 69 times more inhabitants. Data below reflect the district boundaries for the 2019 elections, and the population counts from the 2020 census.
===Underrepresentation===
Because of the lack of a nationwide reapportionment after the publication of every census since the Constitution was promulgated in 1987, faster-growing provinces and cities have become severely underrepresented. Each legislative district is ideally supposed to encompass a population of 250,000.

==Powers==
The House of Representatives is modeled after the United States House of Representatives; the two chambers of Congress have roughly equal powers, and every bill or resolution that has to go through both houses needs the consent of both chambers before being passed for the president&#x27;s signature. Once a bill is defeated in the House of Representatives, it is lost. Once a bill is approved by the House of Representatives on third reading, the bill is passed to the Senate, unless an exact identical bill has also been passed by the upper house. When a counterpart bill in the Senate is different from the one passed by the House of Representatives, either a bicameral conference committee is created consisting of members from both chambers of Congress to reconcile the differences, or either chamber may instead approve the other chamber&#x27;s version.

Just like most lower houses, franchise and money bills originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may still propose or concur with amendments, same with bills of local application and private bills. The House of Representatives has the sole power to initiate impeachment proceedings, and may impeach an official by a vote of one-third of its members. Once an official is impeached, the Senate tries that official.

==Seat==

The Batasang Pambansa Complex (National Legislature) at Quezon City is the seat of the House of Representatives since its restoration in 1987; it took its name from the Batasang Pambansa, the national parliament which convened there from 1978 to 1986.

The Philippine Legislature was inaugurated at the Manila Grand Opera House at 1907, then it conducted business at the Ayuntamiento in Intramuros. Governor-General Leonard Wood summoned the 2nd Philippine Legislature at Baguio and convened at The Mansion in Baguio for three weeks. The legislature returned to the Ayutamiento, as the Legislative Building was being constructed; it first convened there on July 26, 1926. The House of Representatives continued to occupy the second floor until 1945 when the area was shelled during the Battle of Manila. The building was damaged beyond repair and Congress convened at the Old Japanese Schoolhouse at Lepanto (modern-day S. H. Loyola) Street, Manila until the Legislative Building can be occupied again in 1949. Congress stayed at the Legislative Building, by now called the Congress Building, until President Marcos shut Congress and ruled by decree starting in 1972.

Marcos then oversaw the construction of the new home of parliament at Quezon City, which convened in 1978. The parliament, called the Batasang Pambansa continued to sit there until the passage of the 1986 Freedom Constitution. The House of Representatives inherited the Batasang Pambansa Complex in 1987.

===Batasang Pambansa Complex===
The Batasang Pambansa Complex, now officially called the House of Representatives Building Complex, is at the National Government Center, Constitution Hills, Quezon City. Accessible via Commonwealth Avenue, the complex consists of four buildings. The Main Building hosts the session hall; the North and South wings, inaugurated in December 1977, are attached to it. The newest building, the Ramon Mitra, Jr. Building, was completed in 2001. It houses the Legislative Library, the Committee offices, the Reference and Research Bureau, and the Conference Rooms.

== Current composition ==
The members of the House of Representatives, aside from being grouped into political parties, are also grouped into the &quot;majority bloc&quot;, &quot;minority bloc&quot; and &quot;independents&quot; (different from the independent in the sense that they are not affiliated into a political party). Originally, members who voted for the winning Speaker belong to the majority and members who voted for the opponent are the minority. The majority and minority bloc are to elect amongst themselves a floor leader. While members are allowed to switch blocs, they must do so in writing. Also, the bloc where they intend to transfer shall accept their application through writing. When the bloc the member ought to transfer refuses to accept the transferring member, or a member does not want to be a member of either bloc, that member becomes an independent member. A member that transfers to a new bloc forfeits one&#x27;s committee chairmanships and memberships, until the bloc the member transfers to elects the member to committees.

The membership in each committee should be in proportion to the size of each bloc, with each bloc deciding who amongst them who will go to each committee, upon a motion by the floor leader concerned to the House of Representatives in plenary. The Speaker, Deputy Speakers, floor leaders, deputy floor leaders and the chairperson of the Committee on Accounts can vote in committees; the committee chairperson can only vote to break a tie.

To ensure that the representatives each get their pork barrel, most of them will join the majority bloc, or even to the president&#x27;s party, as basis of patronage politics (known as the Padrino System locally); thus, the House of Representatives always aligns itself with the party of the sitting president.

The majority bloc sits at the right side of the speaker, facing the House of Representatives.

<text>Graph paper, coordinate paper, grid paper, or squared paper is writing paper that is printed with fine lines making up a regular grid. It is available either as loose leaf paper or bound in notebooks or Graph Books.

It is commonly found in mathematics and engineering education settings, exercise books, and in laboratory notebooks. 

The lines are often used as guides for mathematical notation, plotting graphs of functions or experimental data, and drawing curves.

== History ==
The Metropolitan Museum of Art owns a pattern book dated to around 1596 in which each page bears a grid printed with a woodblock. The owner has used these grids to create block pictures in black and white and in colour.

The first commercially published &quot;coordinate paper&quot; is usually attributed to a Dr. Buxton of England, who patented paper, printed with a rectangular coordinate grid, in 1794. A century later, E. H. Moore, a distinguished mathematician at the University of Chicago, advocated usage of paper or exercise books with &quot;squared lines&quot; by students of high schools and universities. The 1906 edition of &quot;Algebra for Beginners&quot; by H. S. Hall and S. R. Knight included a strong statement that &quot;the squared paper should be of good quality and accurately ruled to inches and tenths of an inch. Experience shows that anything on a smaller scale (such as &#x27;millimeter&#x27; paper) is practically worthless in the hands of beginners.&quot;

The term &quot;graph paper&quot; did not catch on quickly in American usage. &quot;A School Arithmetic&quot; (1919) by H. S. Hall and F. H. Stevens had a chapter on graphing with &quot;squared paper&quot;. &quot;Analytic Geometry&quot; (1937) by W. A. Wilson and J. A. Tracey used the phrase &quot;coordinate paper&quot;. The term &quot;squared paper&quot; remained in British usage for longer; for example it was used in &quot;Public School Arithmetic&quot; (2023) by W. M. Baker and A. A. Bourne published in London.

== Formats ==
* Quad paper, sometimes referred to as quadrille paper from French quadrillé, &#x27;large square&#x27;, is a common form of graph paper with a sparse grid printed in light blue or gray and right to the edge of the paper. In the U.S. and Canada, it often has two, four or five squares per inch for work not needing too much detail. In Europe, it usually has 5 mm by 5 mm squares. It is used in mathematical exercise books and Lab notebooks.
* Dot grid paper uses dots at intersections instead of gridlines. It is often used for bullet journalling.
* Engineering paper, or an engineer&#x27;s pad, is traditionally printed on light green or tan translucent paper. It may have four, five or ten squares per inch. The grid lines are printed on the back side of each page and show through faintly to the front side. Each page has an unprinted margin. When photocopied or scanned, the grid lines typically do not show up in the resulting copy, which often gives the work a neat, uncluttered appearance. In the U.S. and Canada, some engineering professors require student homework to be completed on engineering paper.
* Millimeter paper has ten squares per centimeter and is used for technical drawings.
* Hexagonal paper shows regular hexagons instead of squares. These can be used to map geometric tiled or tesselated designs among other uses.
* Isometric graph paper or 3D graph paper is a triangular graph paper which uses a series of three guidelines forming a 60° grid of small triangles. The triangles are arranged in groups of six to make hexagons. The name suggests the use for isometric views or pseudo-three-dimensional views. Among other functions, they can be used in the design of trianglepoint embroidery. It can be used to draw angles accurately.
* Logarithmic paper has rectangles drawn in varying widths corresponding to logarithmic scales for semi-log plots or log-log plots.
* Normal probability paper is another graph paper with rectangles of variable widths. It is designed so that &quot;the graph of the normal distribution function is represented on it by a straight line&quot;, i.e. it can be used for a normal probability plot.
* Polar coordinate paper has concentric circles divided into small arcs or &#x27;pie wedges&#x27; to allow plotting in polar coordinates.
* Ternary (triangular) graph paper has an equilateral triangle, divided into smaller equilateral triangles with usually 10 or more divisions per edge. It is used to plot compositional percentages of in systems that have three constituents or three dimensions. (see ternary plot)

In general, graphs showing grids are sometimes called Cartesian graphs because the square can be used to map measurements onto a Cartesian (x vs. y) coordinate system.

<doc id="293607" wikidata="Q1780382" url="?curid=293607" title="Weyerhaeuser">
<text>The Weyerhaeuser Company ( ) is an American timberland company which owns nearly of timberlands in the U.S., and manages an additional of timberlands under long-term licenses in Canada. The company has manufactured wood products for over a century. It operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT).


==History==

In 1900, after years of successful Mississippi River-based lumber and mill operations with Frederick Denkmann and others, Frederick Weyerhäuser moved west to fresh timber areas and founded the Weyerhäuser Timber Company. Fifteen partners and of Washington timberland were involved in the founding, and the land was purchased from James J. Hill of the Great Northern Railway. In 1929, the company built what was then the world&#x27;s largest sawmill in Longview, Washington. Weyerhaeuser&#x27;s pulp mill in Longview, which began production in 1931, sustained the company financially during the Great Depression. In 1959, the company eliminated the word &quot;Timber&quot; from its name to better reflect its operations. In 1965, Weyerhaeuser built its first bleached kraft pulp mill in Canada. Weyerhaeuser implemented its High Yield Forestry Plan in 1967 which drew upon 30 years of forestry research and field experience. It called for the planting of seedlings within one year of a harvest, soil fertilization, thinning, rehabilitation of brushlands, and, eventually, genetic improvement of trees. In 1975 the company bought the 3,200 acres of land of the Northwest Landing and developed the town of DuPont, Washington using a New Urbanism model.

Weyerhaeuser consolidated its core businesses in the late 1990s and ended its services in mortgage banking, personal care products, financial services, and information systems consulting. Weyerhaeuser also expanded into South America, Australia, and Asia. In 1999, Weyerhaeuser purchased MacMillan Bloedel Limited, a large Canadian forestry company. Then in 2002 after a protracted hostile buyout, the company acquired Willamette Industries, Inc. of Portland, Oregon. On August 23, 2006, Weyerhaeuser announced a deal which spun off its fine paper business to be combined with Domtar, a $3.3 billion cash and stock deal leaving Weyerhaeuser stockholders with 55 percent ownership of the new Domtar company.

In March 2008, Weyerhaeuser Company announced the sale of its containerboard packaging and recycling business to International Paper for $6 billion in cash, subject to post closing adjustments. The transaction included nine containerboard mills, 72 packaging locations, 10 specialty packaging plants, four craft bag and sack locations and 19 recycling facilities. The transaction affected approximately 14,300 employees. The deal closed on August 4, 2008.

Weyerhaeuser converted into a REIT when it filed its 2010 tax return.

In 2013, Weyerhaeuser purchased Longview Timber for $2.65 billion including debt from Brookfield Asset Management. The acquisition added of timberland to Weyerhaeuser&#x27;s holdings in Oregon and Washington.

In 2014, Weyerhaeuser spun off its home building unit to TRI Pointe Homes in a $2.8 billion transaction. The company also announced its intention to sell its corporate headquarters in Federal Way and relocate to Seattle&#x27;s Pioneer Square in 2016. The sale and move were completed in 2016.

On November 8, 2015, it was announced that Weyerhaeuser would buy Plum Creek Timber for $8.4 billion, forming the largest private owner of timberland in the United States. The transaction closed on February 19, 2016. At the time of the merger the combined companies own about of timberlands.

In 2018, it won the Weyerhaeuser Company v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service case in the U.S. Supreme Court regarding whether private land can be classified as critical habitat if the land is not currently suitable as habitat for the protected species.

==Operations==
The company&#x27;s operations are divided into three major business segments:

* Timberlands—growing and harvesting trees in renewable cycles.
* Wood products—manufacturing and distribution of building materials for homes and other structures.
* Real estate, energy and natural resources—all surface and subsurface resources in timberlands that are worth more than the timber itself.

==Corporate governance==
Devin Stockfish is the CEO and president of Weyerhaeuser Company. The Weyerhaeuser board of directors consists of: Mark Emmert, Sara Grootwassink Lewis, Rick Holley, Deidra &quot;Dee&quot; Merriwether, Al Monaco, Nicole Piasecki, Marc Racicot, Lawrence Selzer, D. Michael Steuert, Devin Stockfish, Kim Williams and Charles Williamson.

<doc id="293608" wikidata="Q1656432" url="?curid=293608" title="Icknield Way">
<text>The Icknield Way is an ancient trackway in southern and eastern England that runs from Norfolk to Wiltshire. It follows the chalk escarpment that includes the Berkshire Downs and Chiltern Hills.

==Background==
It is generally said to be, within Great Britain, one of the oldest roads the route of which can still be traced, being one of the few long-distance trackways to have existed before the Romans occupied the country. However, this has been disputed, and the evidence for its being a prehistoric route has been questioned.

The name is Celto-British in derivation, and may be named after the Iceni tribe. They may have established this route to permit trade with other parts of the country from their base in East Anglia. It has also been suggested that the road has older prehistoric origins. The name is also said to have been initially used for the part to the west and south (i.e. south of the River Thames) but now refers usually to the track or traces north of the Thames.

From ancient times, at least as early as the Iron Age period (before the Roman invasion of 43 AD) and through early medieval times, it stretched from Berkshire through Oxfordshire and crossed the River Thames at Cholsey, near Wallingford.

==Early documentary evidence==
The earliest mentions of the Icknield Way are in Anglo-Saxon charters from the year 903 onwards. The oldest surviving copies were made in the 12th and 13th centuries, and these use the spellings , , , and . The charters refer to locations at Wanborough, Hardwell in Uffington, Lockinge, Harwell, Blewbury and Risborough, which span a distance of from Wiltshire to Buckinghamshire.

==The &quot;Four Highways&quot; of medieval England==
The Icknield Way was one of four highways that appear in the literature of the 1130s. Henry of Huntingdon wrote that the Ermine Street, Fosse Way, Watling Street and Icknield Way had been constructed by royal authority. The &quot;Leges Edwardi Confessoris&quot; gave royal protection to travellers on these roads, and the Icknield Way was said to extend across the width of the kingdom. Geoffrey of Monmouth elaborated the story by saying that Belinus had improved the four roads so that it was clear that they were the protected highways.

Around 1250, the Four Highways were shown by Matthew Paris on a diagrammatic map of Britain called &quot;Scema Britannie&quot;. The Icknield Way is depicted by a straight line from Salisbury (i.e., Old Sarum) to Bury St Edmunds which intersects the other three roads near Dunstable.

===Icknield Street===
In the fourteenth century, Ranulf Higdon described a different route for the Icknield Way: from Winchester to Tynemouth by way of Birmingham, Lichfield, Derby, Chesterfield and York. This route includes the Roman road running from Bourton-on-the-Water to Templeborough near Rotherham, which is now called &quot;Icknield Street&quot; (or &quot;Ryknild Street&quot;) to distinguish it from the &quot;Icknield Way&quot;.

==Route==

In many places the track consists or consisted of several routes, particularly as it passes along the line of the escarpment of the Chilterns, probably because of the seasonal usage, and possibly the amount of traffic especially of herds or flocks of livestock.

To the west the track can be detected below the escarpments of the Berkshire Downs. Near Wantage, the route along the ridge of the Downs is known as &quot;The Ridgeway&quot;, and the name &quot;Icknield Way&quot; is applied to a parallel lowland route above the spring line at the northern edge of the chalk. Between Lewknor and Ivinghoe there are two parallel courses known as the &quot;Lower Icknield Way&quot; and the &quot;Upper Icknield Way&quot;. In Cambridgeshire, &quot;Street Way&quot; (Ashwell Street), &quot;Ditch Way&quot; and others have been put forward as variant routes, possibly for use in summer or winter.

Many modern roads follow the Icknield Way, such as the B489 from Aston Clinton to Dunstable and the A505 from Baldock to Royston. In some places, especially from the east of Luton in Bedfordshire to Ickleford (so named from the Way crossing a stream) near Hitchin in Hertfordshire, the route is followed by minor roads, and is not distinguishable at all in many places, except by landscape features such as barrows and mounds which line the route, and indentation presumably from ancient and frequent use. It could be described as a belt studded with archaeological sites found at irregular intervals.

The Icknield Way used to form part of the boundary between Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire, and at one time Royston was cut in two by this boundary. Royston is where the Icknield Way crosses Ermine Street.

In the south-west some writers take the Way to Exeter, while others only take it as far as Salisbury. To the north-east, Icklingham, Suffolk, and Caistor-by-Norwich, Yarmouth and Hunstanton, Norfolk, have all been proposed as the destination. In support of the western route, a road at Dersingham near Hunstanton was named &quot;Ykenildestrethe&quot; and &quot;Ikelynge Street&quot; in the 13th century.

==Modern paths==
Modern long-distance footpaths have been created from Lyme Regis on the Dorset coast to Holme-next-the-Sea on the Norfolk coast, following the general line of the Icknield Way.

The Hobhouse Committee report of 1947 suggested the creation of a path between Seaton Bay and the Chiltern ridge, and in 1956 Tom Stephenson proposed a longer route to Cambridge. A route through Norfolk was discussed in the 1960s.

The first section to be officially designated as a Long-Distance Footpath (as National Trails were then known) was that from Overton Hill to Ivinghoe Beacon, and it was declared open as the &quot;Ridgeway&quot; in 1973. The Peddars Way, from Knettishall Heath to Holme-next-the-Sea, forms part of the &quot;Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path National Trail&quot;, which was opened as a Long Distance Route in 1986. Between the Ridgeway and Peddars Way, parts of the original line of the Icknield Way had been covered in tarmac or built over, so a route was devised that avoids walking on roads. In 1992, this was designated by the Countryside Commission as a Regional Route called the &quot;Icknield Way Path&quot;. The &quot;Wessex Ridgeway&quot; from Lyme Regis to Marlborough was declared open by Dorset County Council in 1994.

Charles Thurstan Shaw, archaeologist and long-distance walker, founded the Icknield Way Association which campaigned to reopen the entire Icknield Way as a long-distance path in 1984, the same year he produced the first walker&#x27;s guide to the route.

The author Ray Quinlan has combined most of the Wessex Ridgeway, the Ridgeway National Trail, the Icknield Way Path, the Peddars Way, and a small part of the Norfolk Coast Path to form a path that he calls the &quot;Greater Ridgeway&quot;, with a length of approximately from Lyme Regis to Hunstanton.

Parts of the Ridgeway National Trail and the Icknield Way Path are only usable as a footpath, so the &quot;Icknield Way Path Riders Route&quot; or &quot;Icknield Way Trail&quot; have been created for horseriders and cyclists. The route runs from Bledlow to Roudham Heath, where it joins the &quot;Peddars Way Riders Route&quot;.

==Artists and writers on the Way==

The Icknield Way has inspired a number of writers and artists. Spencer Gore, the founder of the Camden Town Group of artists, painted the route in 1912 while staying with his friend Harold Gilman at Letchworth. His work, influenced by Cézanne, Van Gogh and Gauguin, is acknowledged as one of the pioneering works of British Modernism. One of the best known literary travellers of the Icknield Way is the poet Edward Thomas, who walked the path in 1911 and published his account in 1913. Thomas was interested in ancient roads and inspired by Hilaire Belloc&#x27;s &quot;Old Road&quot; and other travel memoirs published by Constable written by R. Hippisley Cox, Harold J. E. Peake and others. Although the book takes the form of a single 10-day journey, Thomas wrote the book in stages over the course of a year. He was often joined by his brother Julian, both rising at 5 am or 6 am to walk a day. Although more interested in poetic description, his publisher directed him to give more concrete details of his route, thus the book is closer to being a guidebook than Thomas&#x27; earlier, more poetic, travel books. Inspired by Thomas&#x27;s journey, contemporary British nature writer Robert MacFarlane begins his book of walking ancient paths, &quot;The Old Ways&quot;, by walking the Icknield Way, &quot;hoping to summon him [Thomas] by walking where he had walked&quot;. George R. R. Martin used the &quot;Four Highways&quot; as the model for the Kingsway in his &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; novels. The first episode of the 2016–17 documentary series &quot;Britain&#x27;s Ancient Tracks with Tony Robinson&quot; was about the Icknield Way and included drone views of the trail.

<doc id="293609" wikidata="Q11061828" url="?curid=293609" title="Indefinite orthogonal group">
<text>In mathematics, the indefinite orthogonal group, is the Lie group of all linear transformations of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real vector space that leave invariant a nondegenerate, symmetric bilinear form of signature , where . It is also called the pseudo-orthogonal group or generalized orthogonal group. The dimension of the group is .

The indefinite special orthogonal group, is the subgroup of consisting of all elements with determinant 1. Unlike in the definite case, is not connected – it has 2 components – and there are two additional finite index subgroups, namely the connected and , which has 2 components – see &quot;&quot; for definition and discussion.

The signature of the form determines the group up to isomorphism; interchanging &quot;p&quot; with &quot;q&quot; amounts to replacing the metric by its negative, and so gives the same group. If either &quot;p&quot; or &quot;q&quot; equals zero, then the group is isomorphic to the ordinary orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;). We assume in what follows that both &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are positive.

The group is defined for vector spaces over the reals. For complex spaces, all groups are isomorphic to the usual orthogonal group , since the transform formula_1 changes the signature of a form. This should not be confused with the indefinite unitary group which preserves a sesquilinear form of signature .

In even dimension , is known as the split orthogonal group.

== Examples ==

The basic example is the squeeze mappings, which is the group of (the identity component of) linear transforms preserving the unit hyperbola. Concretely, these are the matrices formula_2 and can be interpreted as &quot;hyperbolic rotations,&quot; just as the group SO(2) can be interpreted as &quot;circular rotations.&quot;

In physics, the Lorentz group is of central importance, being the setting for electromagnetism and special relativity. (Some texts use for the Lorentz group; however, is prevalent in quantum field theory because the geometric properties of the Dirac equation are more natural in .)

==Matrix definition==
One can define as a group of matrices, just as for the classical orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;). Consider the formula_3 diagonal matrix formula_4 given by
:formula_5
Then we may define a symmetric bilinear form formula_6 on formula_7 by the formula
:formula_8,
where formula_9 is the standard inner product on formula_7.

We then define formula_11 to be the group of formula_3 matrices that preserve this bilinear form:
:formula_13.

More explicitly, formula_11 consists of matrices formula_15 such that
:formula_16,
where formula_17 is the transpose of formula_15.

One obtains an isomorphic group (indeed, a conjugate subgroup of ) by replacing &quot;g&quot; with any symmetric matrix with &quot;p&quot; positive eigenvalues and &quot;q&quot; negative ones. Diagonalizing this matrix gives a conjugation of this group with the standard group .

===Subgroups===

The group and related subgroups of can be described algebraically. Partition a matrix &quot;L&quot; in as a block matrix:
:formula_19
where &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot; are &quot;p&quot;×&quot;p&quot;, &quot;p&quot;×&quot;q&quot;, &quot;q&quot;×&quot;p&quot;, and &quot;q&quot;×&quot;q&quot; blocks, respectively. It can be shown that the set of matrices in whose upper-left &quot;p&quot;×&quot;p&quot; block &quot;A&quot; has positive determinant is a subgroup. Or, to put it another way, if
:formula_20
are in , then
:formula_21
The analogous result for the bottom-right &quot;q&quot;×&quot;q&quot; block also holds. The subgroup consists of matrices &quot;L&quot; such that and are both positive.

For all matrices &quot;L&quot; in , the determinants of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; have the property that formula_22 and that formula_23 In particular, the subgroup consists of matrices &quot;L&quot; such that and have the same sign.

==Topology==
Assuming both &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are positive, neither of the groups nor are connected, having four and two components respectively.
 is the Klein four-group, with each factor being whether an element preserves or reverses the respective orientations on the &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; dimensional subspaces on which the form is definite; note that reversing orientation on only one of these subspaces reverses orientation on the whole space. The special orthogonal group has components }, each of which either preserves both orientations or reverses both orientations, in either case preserving the overall orientation.

The identity component of is often denoted and can be identified with the set of elements in that preserve both orientations. This notation is related to the notation for the orthochronous Lorentz group, where the + refers to preserving the orientation on the first (temporal) dimension.

The group is also not compact, but contains the compact subgroups O(&quot;p&quot;) and O(&quot;q&quot;) acting on the subspaces on which the form is definite. In fact, is a maximal compact subgroup of , while is a maximal compact subgroup of .
Likewise, is a maximal compact subgroup of .
Thus, the spaces are homotopy equivalent to products of (special) orthogonal groups, from which algebro-topological invariants can be computed. (See Maximal compact subgroup.)

In particular, the fundamental group of is the product of the fundamental groups of the components, , and is given by:

==Split orthogonal group==
In even dimensions, the middle group is known as the split orthogonal group, and is of particular interest, as it occurs as the group of T-duality transformations in string theory, for example. It is the split Lie group corresponding to the complex Lie algebra so2&quot;n&quot; (the Lie group of the split real form of the Lie algebra); more precisely, the identity component is the split Lie group, as non-identity components cannot be reconstructed from the Lie algebra. In this sense it is opposite to the definite orthogonal group , which is the &quot;compact&quot; real form of the complex Lie algebra.

The group may be identified with the group of unit split-complex numbers.

In terms of being a group of Lie type – i.e., construction of an algebraic group from a Lie algebra – split orthogonal groups are Chevalley groups, while the non-split orthogonal groups require a slightly more complicated construction, and are Steinberg groups.

Split orthogonal groups are used to construct the generalized flag variety over non-algebraically closed fields.

<doc id="293612" wikidata="Q713438" url="?curid=293612" title="F4 (band)">
<text>F4 (Flower Four) or JVKV was a Taiwanese boy band consisting of Jerry Yan, Vanness Wu, Ken Chu, and Vic Chou. The group F4 was formed in 2001 after the Taiwanese drama &quot;Meteor Garden&quot; that they starred in was widely successful. Together they have starred in several Taiwanese drama series and released three albums, &quot;Meteor Rain&quot; (2001), &quot;Fantasy 4ever&quot; (2002), and &quot;Waiting for You&quot; (2007).

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, F4 has sold 3.5 million copies of their first two albums all over Asia as of July 2003. In 2007, due to copyright issues, the group changed its name to JVKV, using the descending age of the initials of its members. Other than their country of origin, Taiwan, they have also attained popularity in other parts of Asia, such as the Philippines, mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, and South Korea.

==History==
===2001: Formation and &quot;Meteor Garden&quot;===
The group formed as a result of the success of a Taiwanese drama series, &quot;Meteor Garden&quot;. The series is an adaptation of the Japanese shōjo manga series &quot;Hana Yori Dango&quot;. Yan plays the lead role of Dao Ming Si, an extremely arrogant and rich university student who meets his match in the poor but proud girl, Shan Cai. Chou, Wu and Chu play as his friends Hua Ze Lei, Mei Zuo, and Xi Men, respectively. In the series, the four guys identify themselves as a group called &quot;Flower Four&quot;, or often shortened as F4.

&quot;Meteor Garden&quot; was released in Taiwan in 2001 and turned the leads into stars virtually overnight. In 2002 &quot;Meteor Garden&quot; was released in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines in 2003. The series was aired on Xing Kong channel, and was later remade in China. A sequel, &quot;Meteor Garden II&quot;, was shot in Spain later and released in 2002.

===2001–04: Musical venture, &quot;Meteor Rain&quot;, and &quot;Fantasy 4ever&quot;===
In 2001, F4 became a boy band and signed a record deal with Sony Music Taiwan. In the same year they released their debut album, &quot;Meteor Rain&quot;, and in the following year they released &quot;Fantasy 4ever&quot;. The album includes the Mandarin version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot; that they recorded for the Asian version of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; soundtrack, a Mandarin version of &quot;Yo Te Amo&quot; by Chayanne, and a Pepsi advertisement theme song &quot;Ask For More&quot;.

In 2003, they embarked on an Asian tour to support &quot;Fantasy 4ever&quot;, and went on an unannounced hiatus in 2004 afterwards as the members began to focus on their solo careers.

===2007–08: &quot;Waiting for You&quot; and name change to JVKV===
On April 29, 2007, &quot;Meteor Garden&quot; producer Angie Chai announced that the group would no longer be known as F4. The change in name stemmed from copyright-related issues. Japanese publisher Shueisha, who owns the copyright to &quot;Hana Yori Dango&quot; allowed the group to use F4 as its band name in 2001. However, as Japan had filmed and aired its own live action versions of the popular manga, with its own cast of four, the publisher felt that there may be confusion over the name in different countries. Due to this conflict, the group was renamed JVKV using the first initials of each of the group&#x27;s members. According to the producer, the members are listed in the new name by the order of their birth dates from oldest to youngest, thus Vanness Wu&#x27;s name appears before Vic Chou&#x27;s.

Despite rumours of disbanding, JVKV released their third album, &quot;Waiting For You&quot;, on December 28, 2007. Their third album still bore the name F4, not JVKV. F4 were the first foreign artists to hold 7 consecutive concerts in Japan.

===2013: Jiangsu TV&#x27;s Spring Festival===
In January 2013, the group was confirmed to perform at Jiangsu TV&#x27;s Spring Festival in China along with Harlem Yu. The performance was taped in Beijing on January 30, 2013, and was aired on February 10, 2013. It was their first performance together in four years. During the show, they hinted that they were going to have a concert tour in China, which did not come to fruition.

==Members==
==Solo projects==
JVKV are also individually concentrating on their solo careers in both acting and music. Three of them appeared in &quot;Wish To See You Again&quot;, starring Chou and Chu, while Wu made a few guest appearances in a few episodes. Due to scheduling conflicts, Yan did not star in the series; his part was played by Kingone Wang. Yan filmed a series in Taiwan alongside Wu Chun of Fahrenheit and Show Lo, called &quot;Hot Shot&quot; otherwise known as 篮球火 which was released in the Summer 2008.

===Jerry Yan===

In August 2004, Yan came out with his first solo album titled &quot;The First Time&quot; (第一次 Jerry for You). He&#x27;s acted in Taiwanese drama series such as &quot;Spicy Teacher&quot;, &quot;Meteor Garden&quot;, its sequel &quot;Meteor Garden 2&quot;, &quot;Meteor Rain&quot;, &quot;Come to My Place&quot;, &quot;Love Scar&quot;, &quot;The Hospital&quot;, and made a movie, &quot;Magic Kitchen&quot; 魔幻廚房 (2004). &quot;Hot Shot&quot; (2008) was broadcast in Taiwan, and &quot;Starlit&quot; aired in Taiwan in 2009; and &quot;Down With Love&quot;.

===Vanness Wu===

Wu focused his attention on both movies and music. He first released a solo album titled &quot;Body Will Sing&quot; in 2002, and has since released several more albums. He also has been featured in several music videos, such as &quot;Ai Cuo&quot; with Wang Leehom, the Chinese version of &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; with Beyoncé, and Coco Lee&#x27;s &quot;Hip Hop Tonight&quot;. Besides music, he also has been acting as well, notably in &quot;Autumn&#x27;s Concerto&quot; (下一站，幸福) with Ady An. He also has been involved with several big-screen movies such as &quot;Star Runner&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu Fighter&quot;, &quot;Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Squad&quot;, among others. He also took part in China&#x27;s Jiangsu TV&#x27;s &quot;Stars in Danger: The High Dive&quot; (星跳水立方). As of 2013, he has released two Japanese albums, &quot;Reflections&quot; and &quot;Reason&quot;. He has also collaborated with Kangta from H.O.T on the album &quot;Scandal&quot;, which was produced by SM Entertainment.

===Vic Chou===

Chou was the first JVKV member to release a solo album. He has since came out with 3 solo albums, &quot;Make a Wish&quot; (2002), &quot;Remember I Love You&quot; (2004), and &quot;I&#x27;m not F4&quot; (2007).

He was also on the big hits &quot;love storm&quot; with other fellow JVKV member, Ken Zu.

===Ken Chu===

Chu released his own cookbook, &quot;Delicious Relations&quot; (美味關係), in 2006, after starring in a string of idol dramas. He has also starred in at least one drama per year since 2001, except 2005, where he came out with his own solo album, &quot;On Ken&#x27;s Time&quot;. He released his second solo album &quot;Getting Real&quot; in January 2009.

<doc id="293615" wikidata="Q652421" url="?curid=293615" title="MicroProse">
<text>MicroProse is an American video game publisher and developer founded by Bill Stealey, Sid Meier, and Andy Hollis in 1982. It developed and published numerous games, including starting the &quot;Civilization&quot; and &quot;X-COM&quot; series. Most of their internally developed titles were vehicle simulation and strategy games.

In 1993, the company lost most of its UK-based personnel and became a subsidiary of Spectrum HoloByte. Subsequent cuts and corporate policies led to Sid Meier, Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds leaving and forming Firaxis Games in 1996, as MicroProse closed its ex-Simtex development studio in Austin, Texas. In 1998, following an unsuccessful buyout attempt by GT Interactive, the struggling MicroProse (Spectrum HoloByte) became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive and its development studios in Alameda, California, and Chapel Hill, North Carolina, were closed the following year. In 2001, MicroProse ceased to exist as an entity and Hasbro Interactive sold the MicroProse intellectual properties to Infogrames Entertainment, SA. MicroProse UK&#x27;s former main office in Chipping Sodbury was closed in 2002, followed by the company&#x27;s former headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland, in 2003.

The brand was revived in 2007 when Interactive Game Group acquired it from Atari Interactive, formerly Infogrames. The MicroProse brand was licensed to the Legacy Engineering Group for consumer electronics. Cybergun owned the MicroProse brand from 2010 to 2018, which was then acquired by David Lagettie working with Stealey.

==History==
===Independent company (1982–1993)===
====1980s====
In summer 1982, mutual friends who knew of their shared interest in aviation arranged for retired military pilot Bill Stealey and computer programmer Sid Meier to meet in Las Vegas. After Meier surprised Stealey by repeatedly defeating him when playing &quot;Red Baron&quot;, he explained that he had analyzed the game&#x27;s programming to predict future actions and claimed that he could design a better home computer game in one week. Stealey promised to sell the game if Meier could develop it. Although Meier needed two months to produce Hellcat Ace, Stealey sold 50 copies in his first sales appointment and the game became the first product of their new company. They planned to name it Smugger&#x27;s Software, but chose MicroProse. (In 1987 the company agreed to change its name to avoid confusion with MicroPro International, but MicroPro decided to rename itself after its WordStar word processor). MicroProse became profitable in its second month and had $10 million in sales by 1986.

MicroProse advertised its first batch of games in 1982, under the headline &quot;Experience the MicroProse Challenge!!!&quot; All three were written by Sid Meier for the Atari 8-bit computers: platform game &quot;Floyd of the Jungle&quot;, 2D shooter &quot;Chopper Rescue&quot;, and first-person airplane combat game &quot;Hellcat Ace&quot;. &quot;Hellcat Ace&quot; began a series of increasingly sophisticated 8-bit flight simulation games, including &quot;Spitfire Ace&quot; (1982) and &quot;Solo Flight&quot; (1983), that defined the company.

In 1983, MicroProse ported &quot;Floyd of the Jungle&quot; to the Commodore 64, their first product for that machine. By 1984, the company had begun supporting the Apple II and IBM PC compatibles. MicroProse released the air traffic control game &quot;Kennedy Approach&quot;, written by Andy Hollis, in 1985. &quot;Conflict in Vietnam&quot; (1986) was the final MicroProse title for the Atari 8-bit line.

By 1987, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; considered MicroProse one of the top five computer game companies, alongside likes of Activision and Electronic Arts.

MicroProse also started a branch in the United Kingdom to cross-publish titles in Europe, and to import some European titles to be published in the United States. Notable products from this period include simulation games &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle&quot;, &quot;F-19 Stealth Fighter&quot;, &quot;Gunship&quot;, &quot;Project Stealth Fighter&quot;, &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; and &quot;Silent Service&quot;, and action-strategy games such as &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot; and &quot;Sword of the Samurai&quot;. Several games from different developers were also published by MicroProse under the labels &quot;Firebird&quot; and &quot;Rainbird&quot; (acquired after buying Telecomsoft in May 1989), including &quot;Mr. Heli&quot;, &quot;Midwinter&quot; and Core Design&#x27;s &quot;Rick Dangerous&quot;. During the same period, MicroProse created two labels: MicroStyle (UK), and MicroPlay Software (US), using them for publishing a variety of externally developed games, such as &quot;Challenge of the Five Realms&quot;, &quot;Command HQ&quot;, &quot;Global Conquest&quot;, &quot;Elite Plus&quot;, &quot;Flames of Freedom&quot;, &quot;Rick Dangerous&quot;, &quot;Stunt Car Racer&quot;, &quot;Xenophobe&quot; and &quot;XF5700 Mantis&quot;. By the late 1980s, the company maintained a division, Medialist International, in order to distribute and develop independent titles that was publish through the MicroPlay and MicroProse labels.

====1990s====
In the early 1990s, MicroProse released the strategy games &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroad Tycoon&quot; and &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization&quot;, designed by Meier and developed by its internal division, MPS Labs, on multiple platforms. Critically acclaimed, both of them quickly became two of the bestselling strategy games of all time and spawned multiple sequels. Some of MicroProse&#x27;s simulation games from the 1980s received remakes in the early 1990s, such as &quot;Night Hawk: F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0&quot;, &quot;Silent Service II&quot; and &quot;Gunship 2000&quot;, and made some first cautious attempts to expand into the console market with &quot;F-117A Stealth Fighter&quot; and &quot;Super Strike Eagle&quot; (MicroProse also ported several of their titles to the 16- and 32-bit consoles during the mid-1990s). Brand new simulation and strategy titles included &quot;1942: The Pacific Air War&quot;, &quot;Dogfight&quot;, &quot;Fields of Glory&quot;, &quot;Formula One Grand Prix&quot;, &quot;Harrier Jump Jet&quot;, &quot;Knights of the Sky&quot;, &quot;Starlord&quot;, &quot;Subwar 2050&quot; and &quot;Task Force 1942&quot;.

MicroProse attempted to diversify beyond its niche roots as a sim and strategy game company, looking for opportunities into the arcade game industry. MicroProse designed further action-strategy titles such as &quot;Covert Action&quot; (also designed by Sid Meier) and &quot;Hyperspeed&quot;, and experimented with the role-playing genre by developing &quot;BloodNet&quot; and &quot;Darklands&quot; (in addition to publishing &quot;The Legacy: Realm of Terror&quot;). The company invested a large sum of money to create its arcade game division as well as their own graphic adventure game engine. Meier felt that Stealey was taking the company in a risky direction, and the two could not work out their differences. Meier opted to quietly sell Stealey his share of the company but remained on in the same apparent role for all other purposes to the rest of the staff and their customers to allow Stealey to proceed in this direction.

The arcade division did not perform well, and was canceled after making only two games: &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle: The Arcade Game&quot; and &quot;Battle of the Solar System&quot; (both of which featured high-end 3D graphics but failed to become popular as they were too different from existing machines), while the adventure game engine was used for just three games: &quot;Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender&quot;, &quot;Return of the Phantom&quot; and &quot;Dragonsphere&quot;, before it was sold off to Sanctuary Woods.

In August 1991, MicroProse filed for an initial public offering. The company hoped to raise $18 million to help repay debts from its unsuccessful arcade games. In 1992 MicroProse acquired Paragon Software. It also acquired Leeds-based flight simulation developer Vektor Grafix, which had already developed titles for them (such as &quot;B-17 Flying Fortress&quot;), turning it into a satellite development studio named MicroProse Leeds.

===Under Spectrum HoloByte (1993–1998)===
In December 1993, following Black Wednesday in the UK, MicroProse Software Inc. merged with Spectrum HoloByte, another game company that specialized in simulation games, to form MicroProse Inc. Bill Stealey, who was good friends with Spectrum HoloByte president Gilman Louie, convinced Louie to help MicroProse as Stealey was afraid that some bank would not understand the company culture. MicroProse UK was forced to close its two satellite studios of MicroProse in northern England and dispose of over 40 staff at its Chipping Sodbury head office (Microprose Chipping Sodbury). A core group of artists, designers, and programmers left MicroProse UK to join Psygnosis, which opened an office in Stroud specifically to attract ex-MicroProse employees. In 1994, Stealey departed MicroProse and Spectrum HoloByte agreed to buy out his shares. He later commented, &quot;Spectrum Holobyte had a lot of cash and very few products. Microprose had a lot of products and no cash. It was a great marriage, but the new company only needed one chairman, so I resigned.&quot; Stealey went on to found an independent game company Interactive Magic (also specializing in vehicle simulators and strategy games), while Andy Hollis departed for Origin Systems, and Sandy Petersen joined id Software.

Spectrum Holobyte managed to line up licenses, including &quot;Top Gun&quot; (&quot;Top Gun: Fire At Will&quot;), &quot;&quot; (&quot;&quot;), &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;A Final Unity&quot;, &quot;Birth of the Federation&quot;, &quot;Klingon Honor Guard&quot;) and &quot;MechWarrior&quot; (&quot;MechCommander&quot;, &quot;MechWarrior 3&quot;). Strategy game &quot;&quot; proved to be an unanticipated hit in 1994, spawning multiple sequels. In 1996, Spectrum HoloByte/MicroProse bought out Simtex, earlier a developer of MicroProse-published bestsellers &quot;Master of Orion&quot; and &quot;Master of Magic&quot;. Simtex was re-branded as MicroProse Texas (&quot;Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares&quot;), based in Austin, Texas. Other MicroProse developed and/or published games during that period included &quot;7th Legion&quot;, &quot;Addiction Pinball&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Civilization II&quot;, &quot;Dark Earth&quot;, &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle III&quot;, &quot;Fleet Defender&quot;, &quot;Grand Prix 2&quot;, &quot;Pizza Tycoon&quot;, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Colonization&quot;, &quot;Tinhead&quot;, &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;, &quot;X-COM: Apocalypse&quot;, &quot;X-COM: Interceptor&quot; and &quot;X-COM: Terror from the Deep&quot;. Insufficient financial resources largely prevented MicroProse from developing games for other game platforms, therefore MicroProse concentrated on the PC game market.

MicroProse Software continued as separate subsidiary company under Spectrum HoloByte until 1996. That year, Spectrum HoloByte started cutting a majority of the MicroProse staff to reduce costs. Soon after, it consolidated all of its titles under the MicroProse brand (essentially renaming itself MicroProse). MicroProse&#x27;s remaining co-founder Sid Meier, along with Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds, departed the company after the staff cut, forming a new company named Firaxis Games.

On October 5, 1997, GT Interactive announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire MicroProse for $250 million in stock. The deal was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies. After the announcement MicroProse&#x27;s stock price reached $7 a share. GT Interactive expected the deal to be completed by the end of that year. The acquisition was canceled on December 5, as according to both CEOs &quot;the time is simply not right&quot; for the deal. MicroProse&#x27;s stock plummeted to just $2.31 after the announcement of the deal&#x27;s cancellation, and the company had estimated losses of $7–10 million during the third quarter of 1997 which are largely attributed to dislocations caused by the aborted merger. According to &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, the merger was annulled due to a &quot;fundamental&quot; disagreement over how the joint company would be writing off its research and development costs, as MicroProse insisted to keep their method of paying off the developer immediately.

In November 1997, MicroProse was sued by both Avalon Hill (who had the U.S. publishing rights to the name &quot;Civilization&quot;) and Activision for copyright infringement. MicroProse responded by buying Hartland Trefoil, which was the original designer and manufacturer of the &quot;Civilization&quot; board game, and then sued Avalon Hill and Activision for trademark infringement and unfair business practices as a result of Activision&#x27;s decision to develop and publish &quot;Civilization&quot; video games. Because Hasbro was negotiating the acquisition of both Avalon Hill and MicroProse, the lawsuits were settled in July 1998. Under the terms of the settlement MicroProse became the sole owner of the rights of the name &quot;Civilization&quot; and Activision acquired a license to publish a &quot;Civilization&quot; video game which was later titled &quot;&quot;.

===Under Hasbro Interactive (1998–2001)===
In preparation for its sale, MicroProse closed down its studio in Austin in June 1998; as a result of the closure, 35 employees lost their jobs. On August 14, 1998, Hasbro issued a $70 million cash tender offer to purchase all MicroProse&#x27;s shares for $6 each. This deal was completed on September 14, when Hasbro bought 91% of MicroProse&#x27;s shares and announced that MicroProse had become a wholly owned subsidiary. The remaining shares would also be acquired for $6 in cash. MicroProse was merged with Hasbro Interactive. At the time of Hasbro&#x27;s acquisition, MicroProse had 343 employees, including 135 at Alameda, California (MicroProse Alameda), with a total operating cost of $20 million per year. Besides the development studio in Alameda, MicroProse had three other studios: Hunt Valley, Maryland (Microprose, Hunt Valley); Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and Chipping Sodbury, England.

In December 1998, MicroProse finally managed to publish &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; (in development by Spectrum HoloByte since 1992), to disappointing sales. In December 1999, Hasbro Interactive closed down former MicroProse studios in Alameda and Chapel Hill. Among titles in development that got canceled during that period was &quot;X-COM: Genesis&quot;. The last MicroProse developed game under Hasbro, &quot;B-17 Flying Fortress: The Mighty 8th&quot;, was published in 2000.

===Under Infogrames (2001–2003)===
On December 6, 2000, amist struggling sales and resturcturings, Hasbro announced they would entirely sell off Hasbro Interactive, including MicroProse&#x27;s assets, to French holding company Infogrames Entertainment SA for $100 million, $95 million as 4.5 million common shares of Infogrames and $5 million in cash. The deal was closed on January 29, 2001 with Hasbro Interactive, Inc. being renamed as Infogrames Interactive, Inc.

After the sale, sales and distribution of MicroProse titles transitioned to Infogrames, Inc. in North America and the company&#x27;s standalone international divisions everywhere else. By this time, the company began a slow phase-out of the brand with many MicroProse branded titles previously released by Hasbro being reissued with Infogrames&#x27; logo on the packaging. MicroProse&#x27;s two remaining development studios in Chipping Sodbury and Hunt Valley were rebranded under the Infogrames banner as well, becoming Infogrames Interactive Chippenham Studio and Infogrames Interactive Hunt Valley Studio, respectively. The development of &quot;X-COM: Alliance&quot; was finally aborted in 2002 without a formal announcement.

The final newly-released games released under the MicroProse brand name were &quot;X-COM: Enforcer&quot;, released in April 2001, &quot;Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror&quot;, released in April 2002, and &quot;Grand Prix 4&quot;, released in June 2002. In September, Infogrames shuttered the Chippenham studio and aborting the development of an Xbox port of &quot;Grand Prix 4&quot; that had been currently worked at in the studio within the process.

The Hunt Valley studio worked on &quot;Monopoly Casino: Vegas Edition&quot; for the PC, and then focused on the development of the Xbox title &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes&quot;, which was released in October 2003. Earlier on in May, Infogrames rebranded all their subsidiaries under the Atari brand; including Infogrames, Inc. becoming Atari, Inc., and Infogrames Interactive, Inc. becoming Atari Interactive, Inc. In November 2003, Atari announced the closure of the Hunt Valley studio, which itself was the last MicroProse studio still operating. However, several game developers now exist in the area, including Firaxis Games and BreakAway Games, who all owe their origin to MicroProse.

=== Brand sale to Interactive Game Group and Cybergun Group (2007–2019) ===
In 2007, the MicroProse brand name was sold by Atari Interactive to the Interactive Game Group, a producer of video game titles. The company filed for transfer of trademark protection on December 27, 2007. Originally, it was unclear if MicroProse&#x27;s titles and intellectual properties were also acquired by the Interactive Game Group from Atari/Infogrames, but was soon confirmed that the latter had remained the owners of the properties.

In January 2008, the Interactive Game Group sub-licensed the MicroProse brand and trademark to I-Drs At in January 2008. The company also licensed the MicroProse brand to the Legacy Engineering Group (LEG), which used the license to form subsidiaries called Microprose Systems and Microprose Consumer Electronics Division, selling consumer electronics from February 2008 to the second half of 2008. In October, the licensing agreement between LEG and Frederic Chesnais, owner of Interactive Game Group, was discontinued, forcing LEG to rebrand its subsidiaries to Legacy Consumer Electronics.

In 2010, the Cybergun Group, manufacturer of airsoft gun products, merged with the Interactive Game Group, acquiring the MicroProse brand within the merger. In 2011, the Interactive Game Group was rebranded under the MicroProse name and began licensing and executive producing various casual and budget video game titles that the Interactive Game Group had already licensed including &quot;Jaws: Ultimate Predator&quot; and fitness games featuring Jullian Michaels. In August 2012, MicroProse announced that they would re-partner with their former owner Atari to release &quot;Special Forces: Team X&quot; for 2013. The MicroProse brand continued in use until the end of 2013, when it&#x27;s domain lapsed and the brand fell into dormancy.

On July 22, 2013, during the Atari bankruptcy sale, most of MicroProse&#x27;s former IPs that remained with the publisher were sold to Tommo. In October 2014, Tommo announced the launch of the &quot;Retroism&quot; brand and re-released a majority of MicroProse&#x27;s catalogue through digital media platforms such as Steam.

=== Brand revival (2018–present) ===
In 2018, David Lagettie, an Australian simulation software entrepreneur and one of the makers of &quot;TitanIM&quot; open world military simulation software, purchased the MicroProse brand from the Cybergun Group. Lagettie was a former developer for Bohemia Interactive at their Australian studios before starting his own company to create video game simulators to be used by military groups. Lagettie had been a fan of the original MicroProse games growing up, and as he saw the games ownership transition made the company eventually disappear, he started investigating the fate of MicroProse around 2005. When possible, he began buying whatever IP from MicroProse he could, including the name and original logo trademarks. In February 2019, MicroProse was officially revived as a full publisher of video game and simulation titles, working with the iEntertainment Network on the &quot;WarBirds&quot; series of combat flight simulators. Within the rest of 2019, MicroProse announced &quot;Sea Power: Naval Combat in the Missile Age&quot; by the developer Triassic Games AB, &quot;Task Force Admiral - Vol.1: American Carrier Battles&quot; by Drydock Dreams Games, &quot;Operation: Harsh Doorstop&quot; by Drakeling Labs, and &quot;Warfare 1944&quot; by Drakeling Labs. Lagettie&#x27;s acquisitions drew the attention of Stealey, who subsequently inquired Lagettie about his plans, leading to Stealey joining Lagettie in an unofficial manner in the new MicroProse.

The new company announced in May 2020 the first of three new games to be released for personal computers: Triassic Games&#x27; &quot;Sea Power&quot;, Drydock Dreams&#x27; &quot;Task Force Admiral&quot;, and Hexdraw&#x27;s &quot;Second Front&quot;, with about twenty additional titles planned out for publishing in the future. Lagettie said that while the new MicroProse will branch out to other genres such as adventure and racing games, their core portfolio will be centered on combat-based ones.

MicroProse re-released B-17 Flying Fortress on Steam in November 2021. In 2022, Microprose announced the purchase of the Outerra Game Engine, which they said will complete, release, and also use as the engine for some of their future games. On May 4, 2023, the company announced it had re-acquired the copyright to the Falcon (series).

==Games==
Games by MicroProse include &quot;Civilization&quot; (1991), &quot;Civilization II&quot; (1996), &quot;Darklands&quot; (1992), &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle&quot; (1985), &quot;F-19 Stealth Fighter&quot; (1988), &quot;Formula One Grand Prix&quot; (1992), &quot;Grand Prix 2&quot; (1995), &quot;Grand Prix World&quot; (1999), Ground Branch (2018), &quot;Gunship&quot; (1986), &quot;Lightspeed&quot; (1990), &quot;M1 Tank Platoon&quot; (1989), &quot;Master of Magic&quot; (1994), &quot;Master of Orion&quot; (1993), &quot;Master of Orion II&quot; (1996), &quot;Midwinter&quot; (1989), &quot;Pirates!&quot; (1987), &quot;Project Stealth Fighter&quot; (1987), &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot; (1990), &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot; (1988), &quot;Silent Service&quot; (1985), and &quot;&quot; (1994).

==Legacy==
Sid Meier, who now works at Firaxis Games, eventually got the rights of most of his games back under his control from Atari Inc. &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot; series rights was sold to PopTop Software, who developed &quot;Railroad Tycoon II&quot; and &quot;Railroad Tycoon 3&quot;. Eventually, Poptop was acquired by Take-Two Interactive, which later also acquired Firaxis as well, thus returning the rights to the series to Meier, resulting in &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroads!&quot;, released by Take-Two&#x27;s 2K Games along with a new &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot; and the new &quot;Civilization&quot; games, including &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization III&quot;, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization IV&quot;, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization V&quot;, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization IV: Colonization&quot; and &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization Revolution&quot;. Firaxis Games also developed the &quot;X-COM&quot; series&#x27; reboot &quot;&quot;, which was followed by 2K Marin&#x27;s spin-off &quot;The Bureau: XCOM Declassified&quot;.

&quot;Master of Orion III&quot; was developed by Quicksilver Software and released under the Infogrames label. &quot;Falcon 4.0&quot; rights were sold to Graphsim Entertainment, who developed &quot;Falcon 4.0: Allied Force&quot;.

<text>Edgar Lee Masters (August 23, 1868 – March 5, 1950) was an American attorney, poet, biographer, and dramatist. He is the author of &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;, &quot;The New Star Chamber and Other Essays&quot;, &quot;Songs and Satires&quot;, &quot;The Great Valley&quot;, &quot;The Serpent in the Wilderness&quot;, &quot;An Obscure Tale&quot;, &quot;The Spleen&quot;, &quot;Mark Twain: A Portrait&quot;, &quot;Lincoln: The Man&quot;, and &quot;Illinois Poems&quot;. In all, Masters published twelve plays, twenty-one books of poetry, six novels and six biographies, including those of Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, Vachel Lindsay, and Walt Whitman.

==Life and career==
He was born in Garnett, Kansas, to attorney Hardin Wallace Masters and Emma Jerusha Dexter. His father had briefly moved to set up a law practice, then soon moved back to his paternal grandparents&#x27; farm near Petersburg in Menard County, Illinois. In 1880 they moved to Lewistown, Illinois, where he attended high school and had his first publication in the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. The culture around Lewistown, in addition to the town&#x27;s cemetery at Oak Hill and the nearby Spoon River, were the inspirations for many of his works, most notably &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;, his most famous and acclaimed work.

He attended Knox Academy in 1889–1890, a now defunct preparatory program run by Knox College, but was forced to leave by his family&#x27;s inability to finance his education.
After working in his father&#x27;s law office, he was admitted to the Illinois bar and moved to Chicago, where he established a law partnership in 1893 with the law firm of Kickham Scanlan. He married twice. In 1898 he married Helen M. Jenkins, the daughter of Robert Edwin Jenkins, a lawyer in Chicago, and had three children. From 1903 to 1911, Masters was partners in the firm of Darrow, Masters and Wilson with Clarence Darrow, the famous trial lawyer, and Francis S. Wilson, who later served as Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court. In 1911 he started his own law firm, despite three years of unrest (1908–1911) caused by extramarital affairs and an argument with Darrow. 

Two of his children followed him with literary careers. His daughter Marcia Masters pursued poetry, while his son Hilary Masters became a novelist. Hilary and his half-brother Hardin wrote a memoir of their father.

Masters died in poverty at a nursing home on March 5, 1950, in Melrose Park, Pennsylvania, age 81. He is buried in Oakland cemetery in Petersburg, Illinois. His epitaph includes his poem, &quot;To-morrow is My Birthday&quot; from &quot;Toward the Gulf&quot; (1918):

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Good friends, let&#x27;s to the fields ...
After a little walk, and by your pardon,
I think I&#x27;ll sleep. There is no sweeter thing,
Nor fate more blessed than to sleep.

I am a dream out of a blessed sleep –
Let&#x27;s walk, and hear the lark.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Family history===
Edgar&#x27;s father was Hardin Wallace Masters, whose father was Squire Davis Masters, whose father was Thomas Masters, whose father was Hillery Masters, the son of Robert Masters (born c. 1715, Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, the son of William W. Masters and wife Mary Veatch Masters). Edgar Lee Masters wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Across Spoon River&quot; (1936), that his ancestor Hillery Masters was the son of &quot;Knotteley&quot; Masters, but family genealogies show that Hillery and Notley Masters were, in fact, brothers.

==Poetry==

Masters first published his early poems and essays under the pseudonym Dexter Wallace (after his mother&#x27;s maiden name and his father&#x27;s middle name) until the year 1903, when he joined the law firm of Clarence Darrow. Masters began developing as a notable American poet in 1914, when he began a series of poems (this time under the pseudonym Webster Ford) about his childhood experiences in western Illinois, which appeared in &quot;Reedy&#x27;s Mirror&quot;, a St. Louis publication.

In 1915 the series was bound into a volume and re-titled &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;. Years later, he wrote a memorable and invaluable account of the book&#x27;s background and genesis, his working methods and influences, as well as its reception by the critics, favorable and hostile, in an autobiographical article notable for its human warmth and general interest.

Although he never matched the success of &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;, he published several other volumes of poems including &quot;Book of Verses&quot; in 1898, &quot;Songs and Sonnets&quot; in 1910, &quot;The Great Valley&quot; in 1916, &quot;Song and Satires&quot; in 1916, &quot;The Open Sea&quot; in 1921, &quot;The New Spoon River&quot; in 1924, &quot;Lee&quot; in 1926, &quot;Jack Kelso&quot; in 1928, &quot;Lichee Nuts&quot; in 1930, &quot;Gettysburg, Manila, Acoma&quot; in 1930, &quot;Godbey,&quot; sequel to &quot;Jack Kelso&quot; in 1931, &quot;The Serpent in the Wilderness&quot; in 1933, &quot;Richmond&quot; in 1934, &quot;Invisible Landscapes&quot; in 1935, &quot;The Golden Fleece of California&quot; in 1936, &quot;Poems of People&quot; in 1936, &quot;The New World&quot; in 1937, and &quot;More People&quot; in 1939. Two of his later volumes were published by the Decker Press after its founder, James Decker, asked Masters for permission to print his work; Masters agreed and &quot;Illinois Poems&quot; was published in 1941 and &quot;Along the Illinois&quot; was released in 1942.

<doc id="293622" wikidata="Q2874804" url="?curid=293622" title="Wightman axioms">
<text>In mathematical physics, the Wightman axioms (also called Gårding–Wightman axioms), named after Arthur Wightman, are an attempt at a mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum field theory. Arthur Wightman formulated the axioms in the early 1950s, but they were first published only in 1964 after Haag–Ruelle scattering theory affirmed their significance.

The axioms exist in the context of constructive quantum field theory and are meant to provide a basis for rigorous treatment of quantum fields and strict foundation for the perturbative methods used. One of the Millennium Problems is to realize the Wightman axioms in the case of Yang–Mills fields.

==Rationale==
One basic idea of the Wightman axioms is that there is a Hilbert space, upon which the Poincaré group acts unitarily. In this way, the concepts of energy, momentum, angular momentum and center of mass (corresponding to boosts) are implemented.

There is also a stability assumption, which restricts the spectrum of the four-momentum to the positive light cone (and its boundary). However, this is not enough to implement locality. For that, the Wightman axioms have position-dependent operators called quantum fields, which form covariant representations of the Poincaré group.

Since quantum field theory suffers from ultraviolet problems, the value of a field at a point is not well-defined. To get around this, the Wightman axioms introduce the idea of smearing over a test function to tame the UV divergences, which arise even in a free field theory. Because the axioms are dealing with unbounded operators, the domains of the operators have to be specified.

The Wightman axioms restrict the causal structure of the theory by imposing either commutativity or anticommutativity between spacelike separated fields.

They also postulate the existence of a Poincaré-invariant state called the vacuum and demand it to be unique. Moreover, the axioms assume that the vacuum is &quot;cyclic&quot;, i.e., that the set of all vectors obtainable by evaluating at the vacuum-state elements of the polynomial algebra generated by the smeared field operators is a dense subset of the whole Hilbert space.

Lastly, there is the primitive causality restriction, which states that any polynomial in the smeared fields can be arbitrarily accurately approximated (i.e. is the limit of operators in the weak topology) by polynomials in smeared fields over test functions with support in an open set in Minkowski space whose causal closure is the whole Minkowski space.

==Axioms==

===W0 (assumptions of relativistic quantum mechanics)===
Quantum mechanics is described according to von Neumann; in particular, the pure states are given by the rays, i.e. the one-dimensional subspaces, of some separable complex Hilbert space. In the following, the scalar product of Hilbert space vectors Ψ and Φ is denoted by formula_1, and the norm of Ψ is denoted by formula_2. The transition probability between two pure states [Ψ] and [Φ] can be defined in terms of non-zero vector representatives Ψ and Φ to be
: formula_3
and is independent of which representative vectors Ψ and Φ are chosen.

The theory of symmetry is described according to Wigner. This is to take advantage of the successful description of relativistic particles by E. P. Wigner in his famous paper of 1939; see Wigner&#x27;s classification. Wigner postulated the transition probability between states to be the same to all observers related by a transformation of special relativity. More generally, he considered the statement that a theory be invariant under a group &quot;G&quot; to be expressed in terms of the invariance of the transition probability between any two rays. The statement postulates that the group acts on the set of rays, that is, on projective space. Let (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;) be an element of the Poincaré group (the inhomogeneous Lorentz group). Thus, &quot;a&quot; is a real Lorentz four-vector representing the change of spacetime origin &quot;x&quot; ↦ &quot;x&quot; − &quot;a&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is in the Minkowski space &quot;M&quot;4, and &quot;L&quot; is a Lorentz transformation, which can be defined as a linear transformation of four-dimensional spacetime preserving the Lorentz distance &quot;c&quot;2&quot;t&quot;2 − &quot;x&quot;⋅&quot;x&quot; of every vector (&quot;ct&quot;, &quot;x&quot;). Then the theory is invariant under the Poincaré group if for every ray Ψ of the Hilbert space and every group element (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;) is given a transformed ray Ψ(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;) and the transition probability is unchanged by the transformation:

: formula_4

Wigner&#x27;s theorem says that under these conditions, the transformation on the Hilbert space are either linear or anti-linear operators (if moreover they preserve the norm, then they are unitary or antiunitary operators); the symmetry operator on the projective space of rays can be &quot;lifted&quot; to the underlying Hilbert space. This being done for each group element (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;), we get a family of unitary or antiunitary operators &quot;U&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;) on our Hilbert space, such that the ray Ψ transformed by (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;) is the same as the ray containing &quot;U&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;)ψ. If we restrict attention to elements of the group connected to the identity, then the anti-unitary case does not occur.

Let (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;) and (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) be two Poincaré transformations, and let us denote their group product by ; from the physical interpretation we see that the ray containing &quot;U&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;)[&quot;U&quot;(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;M&quot;)ψ] must (for any ψ) be the ray containing &quot;U&quot;((&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;)⋅(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;M&quot;))ψ (associativity of the group operation). Going back from the rays to the Hilbert space, these two vectors may differ by a phase (and not in norm, because we choose unitary operators), which can depend on the two group elements (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;) and (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;M&quot;), i.e. we do not have a representation of a group but rather a projective representation. These phases cannot always be cancelled by redefining each &quot;U&quot;(&quot;a&quot;), example for particles of spin 1/2. Wigner showed that the best one can get for Poincare group is 
: formula_5
i.e. the phase is a multiple of formula_6. For particles of integer spin (pions, photons, gravitons, ...) one can remove the ± sign by further phase changes, but for representations of half-odd-spin, we cannot, and the sign changes discontinuously as we go round any axis by an angle of 2π. We can, however, construct a representation of the covering group of the Poincare group, called the &quot;inhomogeneous SL(2, C)&quot;; this has elements (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;A&quot;), where as before, &quot;a&quot; is a four-vector, but now &quot;A&quot; is a complex 2 × 2 matrix with unit determinant. We denote the unitary operators we get by &quot;U&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;A&quot;), and these give us a continuous, unitary and true representation in that the collection of &quot;U&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) obey the group law of the inhomogeneous SL(2, C).

Because of the sign change under rotations by 2π, Hermitian operators transforming as spin 1/2, 3/2 etc., cannot be observables. This shows up as the &quot;univalence superselection rule&quot;: phases between states of spin 0, 1, 2 etc. and those of spin 1/2, 3/2 etc., are not observable. This rule is in addition to the non-observability of the overall phase of a state vector.
Concerning the observables, and states |&quot;v&quot;⟩, we get a representation &quot;U&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;) of Poincaré group on integer spin subspaces, and &quot;U&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) of the inhomogeneous SL(2, C) on half-odd-integer subspaces, which acts according to the following interpretation:

An ensemble corresponding to &quot;U&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;L&quot;)|&quot;v&quot;⟩ is to be interpreted with respect to the coordinates formula_7 in exactly the same way as an ensemble corresponding to |&quot;v&quot;⟩ is interpreted with respect to the coordinates &quot;x&quot;; and similarly for the odd subspaces.

The group of spacetime translations is commutative, and so the operators can be simultaneously diagonalised. The generators of these groups give us four self-adjoint operators formula_8 which transform under the homogeneous group as a four-vector, called the energy–momentum four-vector.

The second part of the zeroth axiom of Wightman is that the representation &quot;U&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) fulfills the spectral condition—that the simultaneous spectrum of energy–momentum is contained in the forward cone:

: formula_9

The third part of the axiom is that there is a unique state, represented by a ray in the Hilbert space, which is invariant under the action of the Poincaré group. It is called a vacuum.

===W1 (assumptions on the domain and continuity of the field)===
For each test function &quot;f&quot;, i.e. for a function with a compact support and continuous derivatives of any order, there exists a set of operators formula_10 which, together with their adjoints, are defined on a dense subset of the Hilbert state space, containing the vacuum. The fields &quot;A&quot; are operator-valued tempered distributions. The Hilbert state space is spanned by the field polynomials acting on the vacuum (cyclicity condition).

===W2 (transformation law of the field)===
The fields are covariant under the action of Poincaré group and transform according to some representation &quot;S&quot; of the Lorentz group, or SL(2, C) if the spin is not integer:

: formula_11

===W3 (local commutativity or microscopic causality)===
If the supports of two fields are space-like separated, then the fields either commute or anticommute.

Cyclicity of a vacuum and uniqueness of a vacuum are sometimes considered separately. Also, there is the property of asymptotic completeness &quot;—&quot; that a Hilbert state space is spanned by the asymptotic spaces formula_12 and formula_13, appearing in the collision S matrix. The other important property of field theory is mass gap, which is not required by the axioms &quot;—&quot; that the energy-momentum spectrum has a gap between zero and some positive number.

==Consequences of the axioms==
From these axioms, certain general theorems follow: 
* CPT theorem — there is general symmetry under change of parity, particle–antiparticle reversal and time inversion (none of these symmetries alone exists in nature, as it turns out).
* Connection between spin and statistic — fields that transform according to half integer spin anticommute, while those with integer spin commute (axiom W3). There are actually technical fine details to this theorem. This can be patched up using Klein transformations. See parastatistics and also the ghosts in BRST.
* The impossibility of superluminal communication – if two observers are spacelike separated, then the actions of one observer (including both measurements and changes to the Hamiltonian) do not affect the measurement statistics of the other observer.

Arthur Wightman showed that the vacuum expectation value distributions, satisfying certain set of properties, which follow from the axioms, are sufficient to reconstruct the field theory — Wightman reconstruction theorem, including the existence of a vacuum state; he did not find the condition on the vacuum expectation values guaranteeing the uniqueness of the vacuum; this condition, the cluster property, was found later by Res Jost, Klaus Hepp, David Ruelle and Othmar Steinmann.

If the theory has a mass gap, i.e. there are no masses between 0 and some constant greater than zero, then vacuum expectation distributions are asymptotically independent in distant regions.

Haag&#x27;s theorem says that there can be no interaction picture — that we cannot use the Fock space of noninteracting particles as a Hilbert space — in the sense that we would identify Hilbert spaces via field polynomials acting on a vacuum at a certain time.

==Relation to other frameworks and concepts in quantum field theory==
The Wightman framework does not cover infinite-energy states like finite-temperature states.

Unlike local quantum field theory, the Wightman axioms restrict the causal structure of the theory explicitly by imposing either commutativity or anticommutativity between spacelike separated fields, instead of deriving the causal structure as a theorem. If one considers a generalization of the Wightman axioms to dimensions other than 4, this (anti)commutativity postulate rules out anyons and braid statistics in lower dimensions.

The Wightman postulate of a unique vacuum state does not necessarily make the Wightman axioms inappropriate for the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking because we can always restrict ourselves to a superselection sector.

The cyclicity of the vacuum demanded by the Wightman axioms means that they describe only the superselection sector of the vacuum; again, this is not a great loss of generality. However, this assumption does leave out finite-energy states like solitons, which cannot be generated by a polynomial of fields smeared by test functions because a soliton, at least from a field-theoretic perspective, is a global structure involving topological boundary conditions at infinity.

The Wightman framework does not cover effective field theories because there is no limit as to how small the support of a test function can be. I.e., there is no cutoff scale.

The Wightman framework also does not cover gauge theories. Even in Abelian gauge theories conventional approaches start off with a &quot;Hilbert space&quot; with an indefinite norm (hence not truly a Hilbert space, which requires a positive-definite norm, but physicists call it a Hilbert space nonetheless), and the physical states and physical operators belong to a cohomology. This obviously is not covered anywhere in the Wightman framework. (However, as shown by Schwinger, Christ and Lee, Gribov, Zwanziger, Van Baal, etc., canonical quantization of gauge theories in Coulomb gauge is possible with an ordinary Hilbert space, and this might be the way to make them fall under the applicability of the axiom systematics.)

The Wightman axioms can be rephrased in terms of a state called a Wightman functional on a Borchers algebra equal to the tensor algebra of a space of test functions.

==Existence of theories that satisfy the axioms==
One can generalize the Wightman axioms to dimensions other than 4. In dimension 2 and 3, interacting (i.e. non-free) theories that satisfy the axioms have been constructed.

Currently, there is no proof that the Wightman axioms can be satisfied for interacting theories in dimension 4. In particular, the Standard Model of particle physics has no mathematically rigorous foundations. There is a million-dollar prize for a proof that the Wightman axioms can be satisfied for gauge theories, with the additional requirement of a mass gap.

===Osterwalder–Schrader reconstruction theorem===
Under certain technical assumptions, it has been shown that a Euclidean QFT can be Wick-rotated into a Wightman QFT, see Osterwalder–Schrader theorem. This theorem is the key tool for the constructions of interacting theories in dimension 2 and 3 that satisfy the Wightman axioms.

<text>Secret Agent is a 1936 British spy thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, adapted from the play by Campbell Dixon, which in turn is loosely based on two stories in the 1927 collection &quot;&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham. The film stars Madeleine Carroll, Peter Lorre, John Gielgud, and Robert Young. It also features uncredited appearances by Michael Redgrave, future star of Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938), Michel Saint-Denis as the Coachman, and Michael Rennie in his film debut.

Typical Hitchcockian themes used in &quot;Secret Agent&quot; include mistaken identity, trains and a &quot;Hitchcock Blonde&quot;.

==Plot==
On 10 May 1916, during World War I, British Captain and novelist Edgar Brodie returns home on leave, only to discover his obituary in the newspaper. He is brought to a man identifying himself only as &quot;R&quot;, who asks him to undertake a secret mission: to identify and eliminate a German agent on his way to Arabia to stir up trouble in the Middle East. Upon agreeing, Brodie is given a new identity—Richard Ashenden—a fake death, and the assistance of a killer known variously as &quot;the Hairless Mexican&quot; and &quot;the General&quot;, though he is neither bald, Mexican, nor a general.

Brodie&#x27;s late &quot;predecessor&quot; thought that the enemy agent was staying at the Hotel Excelsior in neutral Switzerland. When &quot;Ashenden&quot; arrives there, he is surprised to find that &quot;R&quot; has also provided him with an attractive wife, Elsa Carrington. Entering their suite, he also encounters her new admirer, fellow hotel guest Robert Marvin, who is only slightly deterred by the arrival of her husband (and continues to flirt with Elsa). When they are alone, Ashenden is displeased when Elsa reveals she insisted upon the assignment for the thrill of it.

Ashenden and the General go to contact a double agent, the church organist, only to find him dead. In his hand, however, they find a button, evidently torn off in the struggle with his killer. When they go to the casino to meet Elsa, the button is accidentally dropped onto a gambling table. Since it looks the same as his own buttons, an experienced mountaineer named Caypor assumes it is his.

The agents persuade Caypor to help them settle a concocted bet: which one of them can climb higher on a nearby mountain. As the moment approaches, Ashenden finds he is unable to commit cold-blooded murder, but the General has no such qualms and pushes the unsuspecting Caypor off a cliff.

However, a coded telegram informs them that Caypor is not their target. The General finds it very funny, but Elsa becomes terribly distraught when they are told. She decides to quit, despite having told Ashenden that she fell in love with him at first sight. In the lobby, she encounters Marvin. With no destination in mind, she persuades him to take her along with him. Meanwhile, the other two bribe a worker at a chocolate factory (the secret &quot;German spy post office&quot;) to show them a very important message received the day before. They discover that it is addressed to none other than Marvin.

Ashenden and the General set out in pursuit, taking the same train as Marvin and Elsa. Before they can arrange anything, the train crosses the border into Turkey – enemy territory – and a large number of soldiers board. Despite this, they manage to get Marvin alone in his compartment. Objecting to cold-blooded murder, Elsa draws a pistol. Before Ashenden can do anything, one way or the other, the train is attacked and derailed by airplanes sent by &quot;R&quot;. Marvin is pinned in the wreckage, but manages to shoot the General fatally before dying. The &quot;Ashendens&quot; quit the spy business.

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;good spy entertainment,&quot; adding that Hitchcock had &quot;done well at blending the tale&#x27;s grim theme with deftly fashioned humor, appropriate romantic interplay and some swell outdoor photography.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; declared it &quot;A pretty good espionage melodrama.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it a &quot;good picture,&quot; adding, &quot;&quot;The 39 Steps&quot; was a first-rate English thriller, you may know, and the bright, quick fresh touch that made it good isn&#x27;t lacking here.&quot;

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; praised the &quot;technical quality&quot; of the film and called the acting &quot;good,&quot; but thought that the ending was &quot;brief and not very satisfactory&quot; and that it was &quot;often difficult to know quite what (Hitchcock) is getting at, whether he is making a profound protest against war and senseless murder or just presenting simple melodrama.&quot; B. R. Crisler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; disliked the film, praising Peter Lorre for his performance as &quot;one of the most amusing and somehow one of the most wistfully appealing trigger men since Victor Moore,&quot; but criticizing technical aspects such as &quot;inexpert camera technique&quot; and &quot;strangely uneven sound recording.&quot; He also thought Madeleine Carroll was a &quot;waste&quot; in her role. Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a poor review, characterizing it as a despoilment of Maugham&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and dismissing it as &quot;a series of small &#x27;amusing&#x27; melodramatic situations&quot;. According to Greene, these &quot;melodramatic situations&quot; are built perfunctorily &quot;paying no attention on the way to inconsistencies, loose ends, psychological absurdities(,) and then drop(ped:) they mean nothing: they lead to nothing&quot;. Greene jokes that the element of humour may have at least livened the film with laughter.
The film was voted the fifth best British film of 1936. It currently has a 87% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with Geoff Andrew of &quot;Time Out&quot; writing, &quot;This thriller may not be one of Hitchcock&#x27;s best English films, but it is full of startling set pieces and quirky characterisation&quot;.

<doc id="293629" wikidata="Q1807879" url="?curid=293629" title="Wick rotation">
<text>In physics, Wick rotation, named after Italian physicist Gian Carlo Wick, is a method of finding a solution to a mathematical problem in Minkowski space from a solution to a related problem in Euclidean space by means of a transformation that substitutes an imaginary-number variable for a real-number variable.

Wick rotations are useful because of an analogy between two important but seemingly distinct fields of physics: statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics. In this analogy, inverse temperature plays a role in statistical mechanics formally akin to imaginary time in quantum mechanics: that is, , where is time and is the imaginary unit ().

More precisely, in statistical mechanics, the Gibbs measure describes the relative probability of the system to be in any given state at temperature , where is a function describing the energy of each state and is the Boltzmann constant. In quantum mechanics, the transformation describes time evolution, where is an operator describing the energy (the Hamiltonian) and is the reduced Planck constant. The former expression resembles the latter when we replace with , and this replacement is called Wick rotation.

Wick rotation is called a rotation because when we represent complex numbers as a plane, the multiplication of a complex number by the imaginary unit is equivalent to counter-clockwise rotating the vector representing that number by an angle of magnitude about the origin.

== Overview ==
Wick rotation is motivated by the observation that the Minkowski metric in natural units (with metric signature convention)
: formula_1
and the four-dimensional Euclidean metric
: formula_2
are equivalent if one permits the coordinate to take on imaginary values. The Minkowski metric becomes Euclidean when is restricted to the imaginary axis, and vice versa. Taking a problem expressed in Minkowski space with coordinates , , , , and substituting 
sometimes yields a problem in real Euclidean coordinates , , , which is easier to solve. This solution may then, under reverse substitution, yield a solution to the original problem.

=== Statistical and quantum mechanics ===
Wick rotation connects statistical mechanics to quantum mechanics by replacing inverse temperature with imaginary time, or more precisely replacing with , where is temperature, is the Boltzmann constant, is time, and is the reduced Planck constant.

For example, consider a quantum system whose Hamiltonian has eigenvalues . When this system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature , the probability of finding it in its th energy eigenstate is proportional to . Thus, the expected value of any observable that commutes with the Hamiltonian is, up to a normalizing constant,
: formula_3
where runs over all energy eigenstates and is the value of in the th eigenstate.

Alternatively, consider this system in a superposition of energy eigenstates, evolving for a time under the Hamiltonian . After time , the relative phase change of the th eigenstate is . Thus, the probability amplitude that a uniform (equally weighted) superposition of states
: formula_4
evolves to an arbitrary superposition
: formula_5
is, up to a normalizing constant,
: formula_6
Note that this formula can be obtained from the formula for thermal equilibrium by replacing with .

== Statics and dynamics ==
Wick rotation relates statics problems in dimensions to dynamics problems in dimensions, trading one dimension of space for one dimension of time. A simple example where is a hanging spring with fixed endpoints in a gravitational field. The shape of the spring is a curve . The spring is in equilibrium when the energy associated with this curve is at a critical point (an extremum); this critical point is typically a minimum, so this idea is usually called &quot;the principle of least energy&quot;. To compute the energy, we integrate the energy spatial density over space:
: formula_7
where is the spring constant, and is the gravitational potential.

The corresponding dynamics problem is that of a rock thrown upwards. The path the rock follows is that which extremalizes the action; as before, this extremum is typically a minimum, so this is called the &quot;principle of least action&quot;. Action is the time integral of the Lagrangian:
: formula_8

We get the solution to the dynamics problem (up to a factor of ) from the statics problem by Wick rotation, replacing by and the spring constant by the mass of the rock :
: formula_9

== Both thermal/quantum and static/dynamic ==
Taken together, the previous two examples show how the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is related to statistical mechanics. From statistical mechanics, the shape of each spring in a collection at temperature will deviate from the least-energy shape due to thermal fluctuations; the probability of finding a spring with a given shape decreases exponentially with the energy difference from the least-energy shape. Similarly, a quantum particle moving in a potential can be described by a superposition of paths, each with a phase : the thermal variations in the shape across the collection have turned into quantum uncertainty in the path of the quantum particle.

== Further details ==
The Schrödinger equation and the heat equation are also related by Wick rotation.

Wick rotation also relates a quantum field theory at a finite inverse temperature to a statistical-mechanical model over the &quot;tube&quot; with the imaginary time coordinate being periodic with period . However, there is a slight difference. Statistical-mechanical -point functions satisfy positivity, whereas Wick-rotated quantum field theories satisfy reflection positivity.

Note, however, that the Wick rotation cannot be viewed as a rotation on a complex vector space that is equipped with the conventional norm and metric induced by the inner product, as in this case the rotation would cancel out and have no effect.

== Rigorous proof ==

Dirk Schlingemann proved that a more rigorous link between Euclidean and quantum field theory can be constructed using the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms.

<text>Roisia&#x27;s Cross was a medieval cross in Royston, Hertfordshire, England. It was erected at the crossroads of Ermine Street and the Icknield Way (cum Ashwell Street). Only the base of the structure survives.

Most likely it was in the southeast angle of the crossroads in the parish of Barkway. This was in the fee of the Lordship of Newsells. The first recorded owner was Eudo Dapifer, steward to William the Conqueror. Whether there was some monument predating this remains a matter for speculation.

==The Royse Stone==
The footstone, a glacial erratic, still exists.
The 18th century antiquarian Reverend William Stukeley described it as:

:&quot;A stone, of very great bulk, with a square hole or , in the centre, wherein was let the foot of the upright stone or tenon, which was properly the cross.&quot;

<doc id="293632" wikidata="Q858330" url="?curid=293632" title="Romance novel">
<text>A romance novel or romantic novel is a genre fiction novel that primarily focuses on the relationship and romantic love between two people, typically with an emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending. Authors who have contributed to the development of this genre include Maria Edgeworth, Samuel Richardson, Jane Austen, and Charlotte Brontë.

Romance novels encompass various subgenres, such as fantasy, contemporary, historical romance, paranormal fiction, and science fiction. Women have traditionally been the primary readers of romance novels, but according to the Romance Writers of America, 16% of men read romance novels. 

A thriving genre of works conventionally referred to as &quot;romance novels&quot; existed in ancient Greece. Other precursors can be found in the literary fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries, including Samuel Richardson&#x27;s sentimental novel &quot;Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded&quot; (1740) and the novels of Jane Austen. Austen inspired Georgette Heyer, the British author of historical romance set around the time Austen lived, as well as detective fiction. Heyer&#x27;s first romance novel, &quot;The Black Moth&quot; (1921), was set in 1751.

The British company Mills &amp; Boon began releasing romance novels for women in the 1930s. Their books were sold in North America by Harlequin Enterprises Ltd, which began direct marketing to readers and allowing mass-market merchandisers to carry the books.
An early American example of a mass-market romance was Kathleen E. Woodiwiss&#x27; &quot;The Flame and the Flower&quot; (1972), published by Avon Books. This was the first single-title romance novel to be published as an original paperback in the US. Nancy Coffey was the senior editor who negotiated a multi-book deal with Woodiwiss. In the UK, the romance genre was long established through the works of prolific author, Georgette Heyer, which contain many tropes and stereotypes, some of which, have recently been edited out of some of her novels. In the 1950s emerging bestselling British romance writers included Catherine Cookson, followed in the 1980s, by Marion Chesney (pen name M.C. Beaton), who was known more widely for her detective series featuring Hamish MacBeth and Agatha Raisin.

Strong sales of popular romance novels make this the largest segment of the global book market. The genre boomed in the 1980s, with the addition of many different categories of romance and an increased number of single-title romances, but popular authors started pushing the boundaries of both the genre and plot, as well as creating more contemporary characters.

==Definition==
One definition of the word &quot;romance&quot; is: &quot;the feelings and behavior of two people who are in a loving and sexual relationship with each other.&quot;

According to the Romance Writers of America, the main plot of a mass-market romance novel must revolve about the two people as they develop romantic love for each other and work to build a relationship. Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters&#x27; romantic love. Furthermore, a romance novel must have an &quot;emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.&quot;

Others, including Leslie Gelbman, a president of Berkley Books, define the genre more simply, stating only that a romance must make the &quot;romantic relationship between the hero and the heroine ... the core of the book.&quot; In general, romance novels reward characters who are good people and penalize those who are evil, and a couple who fights for and believes in their relationship will likely be rewarded with unconditional love. Bestselling author Nora Roberts sums up the genre, saying: &quot;The books are about the celebration of falling in love and emotion and commitment, and all of those things we really want.&quot; Women&#x27;s fiction (including &quot;chick lit&quot;) is not directly a subcategory of the romance novel genre, because in women&#x27;s fiction the heroine&#x27;s relationship with her family or friends may be as important as her relationship with the hero.

There is a lot of controversy among romance authors about what should and should not be included in plots of romance novels. Some romance novel authors and readers believe the genre has additional restrictions, from plot considerations (such as the protagonists&#x27; meeting early on in the story), to avoiding themes (such as adultery). Other disagreements have centered on the firm requirement for a happy ending; some readers admit stories without a happy ending, if the focus of the story is on the romantic love between the two main characters (e.g., &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;). While the majority of romance novels meet the stricter criteria, there are also many books widely considered to be romance novels that deviate from these rules. The Romance Writers of America&#x27;s definition of romance novels includes only the focus on a developing romantic relationship and an optimistic ending. Escapism is important; an Avon executive observed that &quot;The phone never rings, the baby never cries and the rent&#x27;s never overdue in romances.&quot; There are many publishers, libraries, bookstores, and literary critics who continue to go by the traditional definition of romance to categorize books.

A romance novel can be set in any time period and in any location. In recent years, romance novels have even expanded into the galaxy. There are no specific restrictions on what can or cannot be included in a romance novel. Even controversial subjects are addressed in romance novels, including topics such as date rape, domestic violence, addiction, and disability. The combination of time frame, location, and plot elements does, however, help a novel to fit into one of several romance subgenres. Despite the numerous possibilities this framework allows, many people in the mainstream press claim that &quot;all [romance novels] seem to read alike.&quot; Stereotypes of the romance genre abound. For instance, some believe that all romance novels are similar to those of Danielle Steel, featuring rich, glamorous people traveling to exotic locations. Many romance readers disagree that Steel writes romance at all, considering her novels more mainstream fiction.

Mass-market or formulaic romance novels are sometimes referred to as &quot;smut&quot; or female pornography, and are the most popular form of modern erotica for women. While some romance novels do contain more erotic acts, in other romance novels the characters do no more than kiss chastely. The romance genre runs the spectrum between these two extremes. Because women buy 90% of all romance novels, most romance novels are told from a woman&#x27;s viewpoint, in either first or third person.

Although most romance novels are about heterosexual pairings, there are romance novels that deal with same-sex relationships, and some participants in the book industry characterize books dealing with same-sex relationships as F/F, and M/M.

Many famous literary fiction romance novels end tragically. Examples include: 
&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; by Emily Brontë, &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; by Leo Tolstoy, &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; by Colleen McCullough, &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; by Haruki Murakami, &quot;Atonement&quot; by Ian McEwan, and &quot;The Song of Achilles&quot; by Madeline Miller.

==History==
===Development===
The genre of works of extended prose fiction dealing with romantic love existed in classical Greece. The titles of over twenty such ancient Greek romance novels are known, but most of them have only survived in an incomplete, fragmentary form. Only five ancient Greek romance novels have survived to the present day in a state of near-completion: &quot;Chareas and Callirhoe&quot;, &quot;Leucippe and Clitophon&quot;, &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;, &quot;The Ephesian Tale&quot;, and &quot;The Ethiopian Tale&quot;.

Precursors of the modern popular love-romance can also be found in the sentimental novel &quot;Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded,&quot; by Samuel Richardson, published in 1740. &quot;Pamela&quot; was the first popular novel to be based on a courtship as told from the perspective of the heroine. Unlike many of the novels of the time, &quot;Pamela&quot; had a happy ending, when after Mr. B attempts unsuccessfully to seduce and rape Pamela multiple times, he eventually rewards her virtue by sincerely proposing an equitable marriage to her. The book was one of the first bestsellers, with five editions printed in the first eleven months of release. Richardson began writing &quot;Pamela&quot; as a book of letter templates. Richardson accepted the request, but only if the letters had a moral purpose. As Richardson was writing the series of letters turned into a story. Writing in a new form, the novel, Richardson attempted to both instruct and entertain. Richardson wrote &quot;Pamela&quot; as a conduct book, a sort of manual which codified social and domestic behavior of men, women, and servants, as well as a narrative in order to provide a more morally concerned literature option for young audiences. This conduct book genre has a long history.

The Romance novelist, Maria Edgeworth, influenced Victorian era motifs and authors with many of her works including Belinda (1801) and Helen (1834). An admirer of Edgeworth, Jane Austen, further influenced the Romance genre and Victorian era with her novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1813), which was called &quot;the best romance novel ever written.&quot; In the early part of the Victorian era, the Brontë sisters, like Edgeworth and Austen, wrote literary fiction that influenced later popular fiction. While Maria Edgeworth introduced the orphaned heroine archetype in her Romantic works Belinda (1801) and Helen (1834), Charlotte Brontë later adapted the archetype for the Victorian audience in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1847). Brontë&#x27;s romance incorporates elements of both the gothic novel and Elizabethan drama, and &quot;demonstrate[s] the flexibility of the romance novel form.&quot;

While the literary fiction romance continued to develop in the 20th century, the new subgenre of genre fiction, which first developed in the 19th century, started to become more popular after the First World War. In 1919, E. M. Hull&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sheik&quot; was published in the United Kingdom. The novel, which became hugely popular, was adapted into a movie (1921), which established star Rudolph Valentino as the top male actor of the time. The hero of this book was an iconic alpha male who kidnapped the heroine and won her admiration through his forceful actions. The novel was one of the first modern works to introduce the rape fantasy, a theme explored in Samuel Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Pamela&quot; (1740). Although women were gaining more independence in life, publishers believed that readers would only accept premarital sex in the context of rape. In this novel and those that followed, the rape was depicted as more of a fantasy; the heroine is rarely if ever shown experiencing terror, stress, or trauma as a result.

The popular, mass market version of the historical romance, which Walter Scott developed in the early 19th century, is seen as beginning in 1921, when Georgette Heyer published The Black Moth. This is set in 1751, but many of Heyer&#x27;s novels were inspired by Jane Austen&#x27;s novels and are set around the time Austen lived, in the later Regency period. Because Heyer&#x27;s romances are set more than 100 years earlier, she includes carefully researched historical detail to help her readers understand the period. Unlike other popular love-romance novels of the time, Heyer&#x27;s novels used the setting as a major plot device. Her characters often exhibit twentieth-century sensibilities, and more conventional characters in the novels point out the heroine&#x27;s eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love. Heyer was a prolific author, and wrote one to two historical romance novels per year until her death in 1974.

===Asian romance===
During the Ming and Qing dynasties in China, there was a mass circulation and flourishment of a type of printed romantic novels called &quot;caizi jiaren&quot; (&quot;scholar and beauty&quot;), which typically involves a love story between a beautiful and talented maiden and a handsome young scholar. Some examples of these novels include &quot;Ping Shan Leng Yan&quot;, &quot;Haoqiu zhuan&quot;, &quot;Iu-Kiao-Li&quot;, &quot;Huatu yuan&quot;, &quot;Qiao Lian Zhu&quot;, &quot;Wu Mei Yuan&quot;, &quot;Bai Gui Zhi&quot;, &quot;Jin Yun Qiao&quot;, &quot;Ting Yue Lou&quot;, &quot;Wu Jiang Xue&quot;, &quot;Lin er bao&quot;, &quot;Ying Yun meng&quot;, &quot;Tiehua xianshi&quot;, &quot;Shuishi yuan&quot;, &quot;Jinxiang ting&quot;, &quot;Erdu mei quanzhuan&quot;, &quot;Dingqing ren&quot;, &quot;Qingmeng tuo&quot; and &quot;Zhuchun yuan&quot;. They feature themes influenced by the romantic Tang dynasty &quot;chuanqi&quot; fictions such as &quot;Yingying&#x27;s Biography&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Li Wa&quot; and &quot;Huo Xiaoyu zhuan&quot;, as well as the popular works of Song and Yuan playwrights such as Bai Renfu, Zheng Guangzu and Wang Shifu. These novels reached their peak of popularity in the late Ming and early Qing periods, during the 17th century, when a myriad of novels of this type were sold and distributed.

The overwhelming prevalence of this type of romance novels was famously mocked in Cao Xueqin&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, where it ridicules: &quot;There are thousands of such &quot;caizi jiaren&quot; [&quot;scholar and beauty&quot;] books, and yet they are all alike!&quot;. Moreover, these Chinese romance novels would also go on to have an enduring influence on both Eastern and Western literatures.

===Rise of the category romance===
In the 1930s, the British publishers Mills &amp; Boon began releasing hardback romance novels. The books were sold through weekly two-penny libraries and were known as &quot;the books in brown&quot; for their brown binding. In the 1950s, the company began offering the books for sale through newsagents across the United Kingdom.

A Canadian company, Harlequin Enterprises, began distributing in North America in 1957 the category romances published by Mills &amp; Boon. Mary Bonneycastle, wife of Harlequin founder Richard Bonneycastle, and her daughter, Judy Burgess, exercised editorial control over which Mills &amp; Boon novels Harlequin reprinted. They had a &quot;decency code&quot;, and rejected more sexually explicit material that Mills and Boon submitted for reprinting. Realizing that the genre was popular, Richard Bonneycastle finally decided to read a romance novel. He chose one of the more explicit novels and enjoyed it. On his orders, the company conducted a market test with the novel he had read and discovered that it outsold a similar, tamer novel. Overall, the novels were short and formulaic, featuring heroines who were sweet, compassionate, pure and innocent. The few heroines who worked did so in traditional female jobs, including as nurses, governesses and secretaries. Intimacy in the novels never extended beyond a chaste kiss between the protagonists.

On October 1, 1971, Harlequin purchased Mills &amp; Boon. By this point, the romance novel genre &quot;had been popularized and distributed widely to an enthusiastic audience&quot; in Great Britain. In an attempt to duplicate Mills &amp; Boon&#x27;s success in North America, Harlequin improved their distribution and marketing system. By choosing to sell their books &quot;where the women are,&quot; they allowed many mass-market merchandisers and even supermarkets to sell the books, all of which were exactly 192 pages. Harlequin then began a reader service, selling directly to readers who agreed to purchase a certain number of books each month.

===Beginnings of American romance fiction===
In the US, modern romance genre fiction was born in 1972, with Avon&#x27;s publication of Kathleen Woodiwiss&#x27; &quot;The Flame and the Flower&quot;, which was the first of the modern &quot;bodice ripper&quot; romance novels to follow &quot;the principals into the bedroom.&quot; Aside from its content, the book was revolutionary in that it was one of the first single-title romance novels to be published as an original paperback, rather than being first published in hardcover, and, like the category romances, was distributed in drug stores and other mass-market merchandising outlets. The novel went on to sell 2.35 million copies. Avon followed its release with the 1974 publication of Woodiwiss&#x27; second novel, &quot;The Wolf and the Dove&quot; and two more sexually graphic novels by newcomer Rosemary Rogers, &quot;Sweet Savage Love&quot; and &quot;Dark Fires&quot;. The latter sold two million copies in its first three months of release. By 1975, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; had reported that the &quot;Avon originals&quot; had sold a combined . The following year over 150 historical romance novels, many of them paperback originals, were published, selling over .

The success of these novels prompted a new style of writing romance, concentrating primarily on historical fiction tracking the monogamous relationship between a helpless heroine and the hero who rescued her, even if he had been the one to place her in danger. The covers of these novels tended to feature scantily clad women being grabbed by the hero, and caused the novels to be referred to as &quot;bodice rippers&quot;. Cover arts of this style are referred to as clinch covers. A &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article in 1980 referred to these bodice rippers as &quot;publishing&#x27;s answer to the Big Mac: They are juicy, cheap, predictable, and devoured in stupefying quantities by legions of loyal fans.&quot; The term &quot;bodice ripper&quot; is now considered offensive to many in the romance industry.

In this new style of historical romance, heroines were independent and strong-willed and were often paired with heroes who evolved into caring and compassionate men who truly admired the women they loved. This was in contrast to the contemporary romances published during this time, which were often characterized by weak females who fell in love with overbearing alpha males. Although these heroines had active roles in the plot, they were &quot;passive in relationships with the heroes.&quot; Across the genre, heroines during this time were usually aged 16–21, with the heroes slightly older, usually around 30. The women were virgins, while the men were not, and both members of the couple were described as beautiful.

===Category romance adapts===
Category romance lines were slower to react to some of the changes that had swept the historical romance subgenre. Despite the fact that the former Mills &amp; Boon lines were now owned by a North American company, the lines did not have any American writers until 1975, when Harlequin purchased a novel by Janet Dailey. Dailey&#x27;s novels provided the romance genre&#x27;s &quot;first look at heroines, heroes and courtships that take place in America, with American sensibilities, assumptions, history, and most of all, settings.&quot; Harlequin was unsure how the market would react to this new type of romance, and was unwilling to fully embrace it. In the late 1970s, a Harlequin editor rejected a manuscript by Nora Roberts, who has since become the top-selling romance author, because &quot;they already had their American writer.&quot;

Harlequin sold almost $70 million of its paperback romances in 1979 through 100,000 supermarkets and other stores, giving the company almost 10% of the market for paperback books. That year the company began distributing its own books in the United States instead of through Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s Pocket Books. In 1980 Simon &amp; Schuster formed Silhouette Books to publish its own romance novels, beginning what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;perhaps the most bitter war in American book publishing history.&quot; The company sought to take advantage of the untapped talent of the American writers. They published several lines of category romance, and encouraged their writers to create stronger heroines and less dominant heroes. Authors were also expected to address contemporary issues where appropriate. Silhouette soon saw their market share expand, and in 1984, Harlequin acquired them. Despite the acquisition, Silhouette continued to retain editorial control and to publish various lines under their own imprint.

Harlequin had also failed to adapt quickly to the signs that readers appreciated novels with more explicit sex scenes, and in 1980, several publishers entered the category romance market to fill that gap. That year, Dell launched their Candlelight Ecstasy line with Amii Lorin&#x27;s &quot;The Tawny Gold Man&quot;, becoming the first line to waive the requirement that heroines be virgins. By the end of 1983 sales for the Candlelight Ecstasy line totaled $30 million. Silhoeutte also launched similar lines, Desire (sexually explicit) and Special Edition (sexually explicit and longer stories, up to 250 pages), each of which had a 90–100% sellout rate each month.

A 1982 survey of romance readers confirmed that the new styles of writing were attracting new readers to the genre. 35% of the readers surveyed had begun reading romances after 1977. An additional 31% of those surveyed had been readers for between 6 and 10 years, meaning they had become interested in the genre after 1972, when Woodiwiss&#x27; revolutionary novel was published. This means that two-thirds of those surveyed joined the genre after it had begun to change.

The number of category romance lines increased at a rapid pace, and by 1985 there were 16 separate lines producing a total of 80 novels per month. The sudden increase in category romance lines meant an equally sudden increase in demand for writers of the new style of romance novel. This tight market caused a proportionate decrease in the quality of the novels that were being released. By 1984, the market was saturated with category lines and readers had begun to complain of redundancy in plots. The following year, the &quot;dampening effect of the high level of redundancy associated with series romances was evident in the decreased number of titles being read per month.&quot; Harlequin&#x27;s return rate, which had been less than 25% in 1978, when it was the primary provider of category romance, swelled to 60%.

===Further change===
The genre continued to expand in the mid-to-late 1980s, as publishers realized that the more popular authors were often those who stretched the boundaries of the genre. A 1984 novel by LaVyrle Spencer featured an overweight, middle-aged hero who had to make drastic changes to his lifestyle to win the heroine, while a 1987 Dailey novel involved an ugly hero and a heroine who was searching for her birth mother. Jayne Ann Krentz&#x27;s 1986 novel &quot;Sweet Starfire&quot; became the first futuristic romance, combining elements of traditional romance novels and science fiction. The relationships had also modernized: by the 1990s, it was rare to see a book that featured a man raping his future wife.
In the mid-to-late 1980s, contemporary romances began to feature women in more male-dominated jobs, such as offshore oil rigs and the space program. The age range of heroines also began to expand, so that books began to feature women who had already reached 30 and even 40. Heroes also changed, with some authors veering towards a more sensitive man. Despite the broadening of some aspects of the plot, other taboos remained, and publishers discouraged authors from writing about controversial subjects such as terrorism, warfare, and masculine sports. Romance novels began to contain more humor beginning in the 1990s, as Julie Garwood began introducing a great deal of humor into her historical romances.

The romance novel began to expand in other ways as well. In 1989, author Jude Deveraux became the first romance author to transition from writing original mass market paperbacks to being published in hardcover. Her novel, &quot;A Knight in Shining Armor&quot;, &quot;became a natural bestseller.&quot; Several authors found success writing single-title romances set in contemporary times, and publishing houses began to encourage the growth in the genre. Because the novels were set in modern times, they could include more of the elements that modern women could relate to, and soon began to touch on themes such as single parenthood, adoption, and abuse.

The 21st century brought additional changes to the genre that included diversifying main characters and plots to incorporate identities that had not previously been represented.

Scholars of romance novel history have observed that characters with disabilities have been largely underrepresented in mainstream media, including romance novels. By the early 2000s, though, more books in the romance genre featured heroes and heroines with physical and mental impairments. Mary Balogh&#x27;s &quot;Simply Love&quot;, published in 2006, features a hero with facial scarring and nerve damage who overcomes fears of rejection due to his physical appearance to enter a romantic relationship and family unit by the end of the novel. This was a substantial shift from past narratives where disabled characters were &quot;de-eroticized&quot; and not given storylines that included sex or romantic love.

Additionally, autistic characters have gained more representation in the romance genre since the turn of the century. The year 2010 saw Christine Feehan&#x27;s novel, &quot;Water Bound&quot;, featuring a heroine with autism as a significant plot point including a detailed and compassionate portrayal of living and coping with autism. Helen Hoang&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;The Kiss Quotient&quot;, for example, focuses on the heroine&#x27;s Asperger&#x27;s syndrome. However, it is still rare to find romance novels in which there are characters with cognitive disabilities, and they are most likely to be included as secondary characters.

Since the 1980s, many plot lines that were once thought to be taboo by the romance publishing industry have become much more accepted into the mainstream of romance fiction. For example, in the 20th century it was rare to find a book with a hero who was in the military or professional sports. In the 21st century, however, such characters are relatively common and even have their own sub-genres within the romance category.

By 2000, the covers had begun to evolve from featuring a scantily clad couple to showing a view of the landscape featured in the novel.

In the earliest Harlequin romance novels, heroines were typically nurses and secretaries, but as time has passed and women have entered the workforce in larger numbers, romance heroines have spanned the career spectrum. Modern romance novels now feature more balanced relationships between men and women.

==Critical reception==
Some important literary figures received critical acclaim for their romance novels. For instance, the Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez received critical praise for his romance novel &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot;.

Arthur Schopenhauer held that, if poets and novelists across continents have not stopped producing romance novels since millennia, it is because no other topic is more relevant and so the theme never gets old. According to Schopenhauer, romance/love is more important than other topics because it affects the species (not only the individual), in the sense that romance and partner choice is generally a prerequisite to have offspring and continue maintaining the human species in future generations of humankind.

Despite recent rehabilitation and merging of the genre with other genres, there is sometimes a negative stigma with the romance novel. Some dedicated readers are embarrassed to admit to buying or even reading the books. The romance genre has sometimes generated criticism. Some critics point to a lack of suspense, as it may seem obvious that the hero and heroine will eventually resolve their issues, and wonder whether it is beneficial &quot;for women to be whiling away so many hours reading impossibly glamorized love stories.&quot; According to fiction author Melissa Pritchard, a romance novel &quot;perpetuates something slightly dangerous, that there&#x27;s this notion, that there&#x27;s this perfect love out there, and it can distract you from the work of loving yourself.&quot;

Romance novelists attribute the stigma to the fact that romance is, according to some, a genre &quot;written almost exclusively by women for women.&quot; Romance novelist Jennifer Crusie counters that in the modern romance novel &quot;a woman is rewarded with unconditional love [only] if she remains true to herself,&quot; while novelist Susan Elizabeth Phillips believes that romance novels are popular because the heroine typically wins, sometimes overcoming great odds so that she is no longer a victim.

Peer-reviewed academic scholarship examining romance novels has increased enormously in the last few decades. Scholars are analysing the significance and impact of the genre, increasingly from a feminist, gender and equity studies perspective. The profile of the romance genre has also been raised by the financial and critical success of the adaptations of two successful series of novels: Outlander by Diana Gabaldon, and Bridgerton by Julia Quinn, by paid television network, STARZ and streaming service, Netflix.

Debates about whether these novels fall inside or outside the contemporary romance genre, and the extent to which they transcend the genre to be multi-genre, has received mainstream media attention in part due to Gabaldon&#x27;s frequent and prominent assertions that her Outlander series is not Romance Fiction. However, both scholarly analysis and the conversations between Gabaldon and her publisher about whether to market the books as romances, reveal that the discourse about genre labels is more nuanced. In 2022, it was announced that the best-selling &quot;cult&quot; Winston Brother series by self-published &quot;smart-romance&quot; author, Penny Reid, has been optioned for a television adaptation by Tomorrow Studios.

==Formats==

Romance novels are divided into two sub-sets, category romances, also known as series romances, and single title romances. Many authors write only within one of the formats, but others, including Jennifer Crusie and Jayne Ann Krentz, have achieved success in both formats.

===Category romance===

Category romances are short, usually no more than 200 pages, or about 55,000 words. The books are published in clearly delineated lines, with a certain number of books published in each line every month. In many cases, the books are numbered sequentially within the line. These novels have widespread distribution—often worldwide—and a single U.S. print run, remaining on a bookseller&#x27;s shelves until they are sold out or until the next month&#x27;s titles are released and take their place. Writers for the largest publisher of category romance, Harlequin/Mills &amp; Boon, can find their novels translated into 26 languages and sold in over 100 international markets.

To write a successful novel of this length, the &quot;author must pare the story down to its essentials. Subplots and minor characters are eliminated or relegated to the backstory.&quot; Nonetheless, category romance lines each have a distinct identity, which may involve similar settings, characters, time periods, levels of sensuality, or types of conflict. Publishers of category romances usually issue guidelines for each line, specifying the elements necessary for a novel to be included in each line. Depending on the current market and perceived reader preferences, publishers frequently begin new lines or end existing ones. Most recently, erotic and Christian lines have been introduced while traditional Regency romance lines have ended.

===Single-title romances===
Single-titles novels are romance novels not published as part of a publisher&#x27;s category. They are longer than category romances, typically between 350 and 400 pages, or 100,000-110,000 words. Publishers may release the novels over a shorter period of time for sales and publicity reasons, but on average authors write 1.5 novels per year and have one each year published. Single-title novels remain on the booksellers&#x27; shelves at the discretion of the store.

Despite their name, single-title novels are not always stand alone novels. Some authors prefer to write several interconnected books, ranging in number from trilogies to long-running series, so that they can revisit characters or worlds. Such sets of books often have similar titles, and may be labelled as &quot;Number 1 in the XXX Series&quot;, but they are not considered series romances because they are not part of a particular line.

==Subgenres==

Because the definition of a romance novel does not limit the types of plot devices, time frames, or locations that can be included, the genre has grown to encompass a wide variety of material and spawned multiple subgenres. Subgenres of romance are often closely related to other literature genres, and some books could be considered a romance subgenre novel and another genre novel at the same time. For example, romantic suspense novels are often similar to mysteries, crime fiction and thrillers, and paranormal romances use elements popular in science fiction and fantasy novels.

===Contemporary romance===

Contemporary romance, which is set after World War II, is often what people mean when they refer to a romance novel. Contemporary romance novels—the largest subgenre—are set in the time when they are written, and usually reflect the mores of that time. Heroines in contemporary romances prior to 1970 usually quit working when they marry or have children—while heroines after 1970 usually have, and keep, a career. As contemporary romance novels have grown to contain more complex plotting and more realistic characters, the line between this subgenre and the genre of women&#x27;s fiction has blurred.

Most contemporary romance novels contain elements that date the books. The majority of them eventually become irrelevant to more modern readers and go out of print. Those that survive the test of time, such as Jane Austen&#x27;s work, are often reclassified as historical romances.

Over half of the romantic fiction published in the United States in 2004 (1,468 out of 2,285 books) were contemporary romance novels. Contemporary romance novels have twice been chosen by Kelly Ripa to be featured in her Reading with Ripa book club.

===Historical romance===
Historical romance, also known as historical novel, is a broad category of fiction which the plot takes place in a setting located in the past, which Walter Scott helped popularize in the early 19th century, with works such as &quot;Rob Roy&quot; and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;.

This subgenre includes a wide variety of other subgenres, including Regency romance. Mass-market historical romance novels are rarely published in hardcover, with fewer than 15 receiving that status each year, less than one-fifth of the number of contemporary romance novels published in that format. Because historical romances are primarily published in mass-market format, their fortunes are tied to a certain extent to the mass-market trends. Booksellers and large merchandisers now sell fewer mass market paperbacks, preferring trade paperbacks or hardcovers, which prevents historical romances from being sold in some price clubs and other mass merchandise outlets.

In 2001, 778 mass-market historical romances were published, a 10-year high. By 2004, the annual number had dropped to 486, which was still 20% of all romance novels published. Kensington Books says they receive fewer submissions of historical novels, and their previously published authors have switched to contemporary.

===Romantic suspense===
Romantic suspense involves an intrigue or mystery for the protagonists to solve. Typically, however, the heroine is the victim of a crime or attempted crime, and works with a hero, who tends to be in a field where he would serve as a protector, such as a police officer, FBI agent, bodyguard, or Navy SEAL. By the end of the novel, the mystery is resolved and the interaction between the hero and heroine has evolved into a solid relationship. These novels primarily take place in contemporary times, but authors such as Amanda Quick have broadened the genre to also include historical timeframes.

Like all romances, romantic suspense novels must place the development of a relationship between the protagonists at the heart of the story. The relationship &quot;must impact each decision they make and increase the tension of the suspense as it propel the story. In turn, the events of suspense must also directly affect the relationship and move the story forward.&quot; Romantic suspense novels tend to have more &quot;clean&quot; language, without the &quot;emotional, intimate&quot; descriptions often used in more traditional romances. Because the mystery is a crucial aspect of the plot, these novels are more plot-driven instead of character-driven.

This blend of the romance and mystery was perfected by Mary Stewart, who wrote ten romantic suspense novels between 1955 and 1967. Stewart was one of the first to seamlessly combine the two genres, maintaining a full mystery while focusing on the courtship between two people. In her novels, the process of solving the mystery &quot;helps to illuminate&quot; the hero&#x27;s personality, helping the heroine to fall in love with him.

===Paranormal romance===

Paranormal romance blends the real with the fantastic or science fictional. The fantastic elements may be woven into an alternate version of our own world in an urban fantasy involving vampires, werewolves, and/or demons, or they may be more &quot;normal&quot; manifestations of the paranormal—humans with psychic abilities, witches, or ghosts. Time travel, futuristic, and extraterrestrial romances also fall beneath the paranormal umbrella.

These novels often blend elements of other subgenres—including suspense, mystery, or chick lit—with their fantastic themes. A few paranormal romances are set solely in the past and are structured much like any historical romance novel. Others are set in the future, sometimes on different worlds. Still others have a time travel element with either the hero or the heroine traveling into the past or the future. Between 2002 and 2004, the number of paranormal romances published in the United States doubled to 170 per year. A popular title in the genre can sell over 500,000 copies.

Many paranormal romances rely on the blend of contemporary American life with the existence of supernatural or magically empowered beings, human or otherwise. Sometimes the larger culture is aware of the magical in its midst; sometimes it is not. Some paranormal romances focus less on the specifics of their alternate worlds than do traditional science fiction or fantasy novels, keeping the attention strongly on the underlying romance. Others develop the alternate reality meticulously, combining well-planned magical systems and inhuman cultures with contemporary reality.

===Science fiction romance===

These books (time travel, fantasy, science fiction, and futuristic) blend romance with fantasy or science fiction, and they often overlap the paranormal subgenre. While exploring their alternate worlds, they also offer a fully developed romance. The sensuality level in these novels varies from chaste to very sexy.

Over the years, many publishers have included futuristic, fantasy, and science-fiction romances in their contemporary series lines (for example, Harlequin Temptation, Harlequin Superromance, Silhouette Special Edition). Today these romances are published by most major publishers, including Berkley Books, Harlequin&#x27;s LUNA and MIRA, Pocket Books, Kensington Books, Dorchester Publishing, Avon Books, and NAL. The e-Book publisher Ellora&#x27;s Cave has published many erotic romances with fantasy themes and other-worldly heroes and heroines.

There is overlap in these subgenres. Steampunk is science fiction mixed with alternate history which takes place during the Victorian era. It mixes historical elements with technology (for example, the television series &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; (1965–1969)). Authors in this subgenre include M. K. Hobson and Gail Dayton.

The first futuristic romance to be marketed by a mainstream romance publisher, Jayne Ann Krentz&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Starfire&quot;, was published in 1986 and was a &quot;classic road trip romance&quot; that happened to be set in a separate galaxy. This genre has become more popular since 2000. Krentz attributes the popularity of this romance genre to the fact that the novels &quot;are, at heart, classic historical romances that just happen to be set on other worlds.&quot;

===Fantasy romance===
Fantasy romance, also known as romantic fantasy, is a subgenre of fantasy fiction, describing a fantasy story using many of the elements and conventions of the romance genre. Romantic fantasy has been published by both fantasy and romance lines, with some publishers distinguishing between &quot;fantasy romance&quot; being more like a contemporary fantasy novel with romantic elements, and &quot;romantic fantasy&quot; with more emphasis on the romance elements of the story.

===Time-travel romance===

Time-travel romances are a version of the classic &quot;fish out of water&quot; story. In most, the heroine is from the present day and travels into the past to meet the hero. In a smaller subset of these novels, the hero, who lives in the past, travels forward into his future to meet the heroine. A successful time-travel romance must have the characters react logically to their experience and should investigate some of the differences, both physical and mental, between the world the character normally inhabits and the one where they landed. Some writers end their novels with the protagonists trapped in different time periods and unable to be together—to the displeasure of many readers of the genre.

===Inspirational romance===
Inspirational romance, as the market exists today, combines explicitly Christian themes with the development of a romantic relationship. In 2004, 167 novels were published in the inspirational romance subgenre. These novels typically do not include gratuitous violence or swearing, and the central courtship is chaste. Sex, if it is present at all, occurs after marriage and is not explicitly detailed. Many novels in this genre also focus on the hero or heroine&#x27;s faith, turning the love story into &quot;a triangle: the man and the woman and also their relationship with God.&quot; Themes such as forgiveness, honesty, and fidelity are common.

The first line of series inspirational romances debuted shortly after the 1980 U.S. presidential election, when Silhouette launched their Silhouette Inspirations line. The books were aimed at born-again Christians and were marketed in religious bookstores. The Silhouette Inspirations line was closed after Harlequin acquired Silhouette in 1984 because it was not profitable. However, other Christian publishers continued to produce romance novels, including historical and contemporary, and Harlequin later rejoined the market with the 1998 launch of its Steeple Hill and Love Inspired lines.

=== Young Adult romance ===
Young adult romance are romance novels where young adult life is centered. The subgenre is believed to have been started in 1942, with varying degrees of popularity throughout time. The romance between two characters is the central focus of the book, however other aspects of young adult/teen life are also explored, often with coming-of-age themes and navigating relationships. While most romance ends with &quot;happily ever after,&quot; &quot;happily for now&quot; is generally accepted due to the age of characters.

Young adult romance has its own subgenres which include contemporary, fantasy, sci-fi, LGBTQIA+, and more.

=== LGBTQIA+ romance ===
LGBTQIA+ romance has been a fast-growing subgenre, especially with the rise of indie publishing and social media granting access to doors that are normally closed. Male/male romance leads the subgenre, but lesbian, bisexual, transgender, genderqueer, and ace-spectrum (or asexual and aromantic) fiction are all featured prominently, with multiple small publishing houses leading the way. The romantic relationship is the central story, and focus is usually taken off of trauma.

=== Black romance ===
Black romance is a romance where both main characters and majority of supporting characters are black. The abolitionist and suffragist Frances E. W. Harper wrote what was arguably the first African American romance novel, &quot;Iola Leroy&quot; in 1892. The subgenre started growing in the early 1980s along with other romance subgenres. Black love historical romance novels center the love and happiness of its main characters, and usually includes black history and black people standing in solidarity. Political and social commentary is the norm, with a large majority of books expressing explicitly abolitionist and activist views. In contemporary black love, themes of activism are not as dominant, however normally are still included. Popular authors include Beverly Jenkins, Alyssa Cole, Rebecca Weatherspoon, Kennedy Ryan, and Christina C. Jones.

===Multicultural romance===
Multicultural romance typically features a hero and/or heroine who is African-American, although some multicultural lines also include Asian or Hispanic heroes or heroines or interracial relationships. The first line of multicultural romance novels, Arabesque, was launched by Kensington Books in 1994. BET Books purchased the line in 1998, and the number of new authors that they publish has continued to expand each year. BET has also developed some of the Arabesque novels into made-for-television movies.

In 1999, Kensington Publishing launched the first line of Latino romance novels – ENCANTO. The ENCANTO novels were originally released in two ways – a bilingual Spanish/English version and a Spanish-only version. Two novels were published every month until late 2001, when the line went into hiatus. Despite the demise of the line, several of the ENCANTO authors have continued writing novels with Latino protagonists, namely Sylvia Mendoza, Tracy Montoya, Caridad Pineiro, Berta Platas, Lara Rios and Lynda Sandoval.

Although romance novels featuring African-Americans and Hispanic protagonists are becoming more popular, those featuring Asian or Asian-American characters are rare. Author Tess Gerritsen believes this is due to the fact that there are fewer Asian-American women who read romances: &quot;We read romances because we want to feel good about love...in order to do that, the reader must identify with the heroine.&quot;

===Erotic romance===
Erotic romance is a blend of romance and erotica. Erotic romance novels are characterized by strong sexual content, but can contain elements of any of the other romance subgenres. Erotic romance novels tend to use more frank language, avoiding many of the euphemisms used in books with milder content. These novels also usually include more sex scenes, often focusing more on the sex act rather than being a more traditional love scene, and may include more unusual positions or acts. Despite a greater emphasis on the sex scenes, however, erotic romance is distinguishable from traditional pornography. Pornography concentrates on the sex acts, but erotic novels include well-developed characters and a plot that could exist without the sex acts. In a vast majority of erotic romance novels, the sexual act progresses the plot or furthers the character development in some way and are critical to the story.

Erotic romances&#x27; lengths run from short stories to single-title novels. Some of these are published as part of a category, such as Harlequin Blaze, while others are published as part of an anthology and are only novella length. Even single-title erotic romances may be as short as a novella, however.

Many of the publishers of erotic romance are either small press publishers or electronic book publishers. Writers often have more leeway as to what types of erotic acts can be included when working with an electronic publisher than they would have when working with a print publisher. The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly, leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books. Some subjects are still considered taboo, even with erotic romance. Themes such as pedophilia, incest, and bestiality are discouraged by all publishers.

The market for erotic romances has grown rapidly. Ellora&#x27;s Cave, an electronic publisher that focuses on erotic romance, became the first electronic publisher recognized by the Romance Writers of America as a legitimate publisher. Ellora&#x27;s Cave went out of business at the end of 2016. Several other smaller presses largely focused on erotic romance have also closed up shop, including Samhain Publishing (closed 2017) and Loose Id (closed 2018). Changeling Press, focused on short-form erotic romance, is still publishing as of March, 2021.

===Chick lit===
Chick lit or chick literature is named after the readership it attracts (women in their twenties and thirties), and it is said to be inspired by the 1996 novel &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;. Some of the dominant themes of chick lit are a single woman&#x27;s journey through career, high-powered work environment, personal life, relationships, motherhood, and parenting. Some subcategories of this genre are baby lit and mummy lit.

==Tropes==
In additional to subgenres, tropes are an important part of romance novels. A trope is a common or overused theme or plot device. Tropes are used in all forms of storytelling but in romance novels they are often a specific aspect of the story that readers seek out. Tropes, which relate to plot, are often confused or conflated with &quot;hooks&quot; which are character or setting elements that attract readers; that is, profession, location, season, character trait, etc.

Tropes may seen cliché to some but they speak to universal experiences readers can relate to.  They give romance writers the opportunity to draw readers in by offering them something familiar. Tropes can be a starting point to innovate from and authors can intentionally subvert them to great effect. There are a myriad of tropes that can be found in romance novels but some of the most common are:

=== Love triangle ===
Two characters compete for a third&#x27;s love.

=== Friends to Lovers ===
Long time friends become romantically involved.

=== Forced Proximity ===
Characters are forced to be around each other so much they can&#x27;t help but fall for each other. Arranged Marriage, another romance trope, is a subset of this trope.

=== Enemies to Lovers ===
Characters who can&#x27;t stand each other overcome their differences and have a change of heart.

=== Forbidden Love ===
A relationship between the characters is frowned upon, explicitly off limits, or taboo but it happens anyway. Workplace Romances and other hooks involving the status or relationship of the characters are often subsets of this trope.

=== Second Chance ===
Characters who were once together but broke up then find their way back to each other.

=== Fake Relationship ===
Characters enter into an agreed upon fake relationship which turns into the real thing.

=== Forced seduction ===
==Explicit content==
The existence (or not) of sexual content and the nature of said content is important to readers of romance novels. This content is often referred to as “spice,” “steam,” or “heat” by readers, reviewers, and publishers. Explicit content is subjective and not only takes into consideration the amount of sexual content in a story but also the type of content and the level of description. 

There is no definitive rating system or scale outlined for sexual content in romance novels. Information on explicit content in a specific romance novel can be difficult to find and is often inconsistent because of the subjective nature of the content and rating systems. Some publishers or authors list content ratings for their books based on their own guidelines. It is somewhat controversial to see explicit content ratings in a library catalog. The American Library Association views labeling as a form of censorship and also feels that labeling explicit content implies that someone has screened all the books available in their catalog. However, some libraries will use tags for this content in their catalogs. These tags are primarily to aid library staff in providing reference help for patrons and can be more difficult (but not impossible) to locate for general users. Some fans have created their own databases or search engines to help readers find the explicit content level and other romance book characteristics they are looking for.

==Markets==

===North America===
The romance fiction market &quot;has been impervious to the overall economic recession, with faithful readers spending up to $40 a month&quot; on romance novels in 1982. That year, paperback romances totaled $300 million in sales, and the total audience was estimated at 20 million readers. A survey of 600 regular romance readers the same year &quot;found that they mirror the general population in age, education, and marital and socioeconomic status.&quot; Over half of the women had at least some college education, and 40% were employed full-time. 60% of the women surveyed read at least one romance every two days. The women admitted to reading romances as an antidote to stress, for mental escape, and to learn about history and new careers.

 at least 25% of all paperbacks were romance novels; by 1991, they comprised 46% of all mass market paperbacks sold in the US. This expansion was due in part to voracious readers, with over half of Harlequin&#x27;s customers purchasing 30 novels per month. By this time, the romance novel audience had become more educated, with 45% having a college degree, and more than half of the audience worked outside the home.

By the 2000s, romance had become the most popular genre in modern literature. In 2008, romantic fiction generated $1.37 billion in sales, with 7,311 romance novels published and making up 13.5% of the consumer book market. Over 74 million people claimed to have read at least one romance novel in 2008, according to a Romance Writers of America study. The study reported that 9.5% of romance readers identified themselves as male, and that romance readers were more likely to be married or living with a partner. According to the RWA 84% of romance buyers were women and 16% were men. Of the entire American population, 24.6% read at least one romance novel in 2008.

===International markets===

74.8 million people read an English-language romance novel in 2008. Harlequin sells more than 4 books per second, half of them internationally. Author Heather Graham attributes this to the fact that &quot;emotions translate easily.&quot; In the United Kingdom, over 20% of all fiction books sold each year are romance novels.

Although romance novels are translated into over 90 languages, most authors of women&#x27;s fiction are from Great Britain or North America. In France, where over 12 million romance novels are sold each year, all are translations, as are almost all Harlequin novels in Italy. Some publishing companies in Germany refuse to allow their romance authors to use their own names, fearing that readers will not buy a romance novel that does not have an American pseudonym.

The Anglo-Saxon perspective in the fiction at times can be much less successful in a European market. Although Italy is the strongest foreign market for the chick lit sold by single-title imprint Red Dress Ink, in that country romance readers do not care to read books about cowboys, as this type of occupation was not common in their culture. The paranormal romance genre is not popular in countries such as Poland and Russia, although historical romance tends to be very successful. Inspirational romance does not sell well in Europe, where romances that feature babies are very popular. German readers enjoy reading more erotic romance novels, and some German translations of English romance novels expand or insert love scenes into otherwise tame stories. The alternate scenario also occurs, as other German translators censor the love scenes.

As of 2014, romance is the most popular literary genre in Russia (chosen 13% of respondents), especially among the younger audience.

In 2004, sales of romance novels in Australia increased 28% over the year before. Between 1999 and 2004 there was an increase of 40–50% in the number of new titles released. Harlequin, which received 20,000 unsolicited manuscripts each year, found that women are 99% of romance readers.

<doc id="293638" wikidata="Q2292497" url="?curid=293638" title="2001 Linate Airport runway collision">
<text>[[Scandinavian Airlines System]] Flight 686, a McDonnell Douglas MD-87 airliner carrying 110 people bound for Copenhagen, Denmark, collided on take-off with a Cessna Citation CJ2 business jet carrying four people bound for Paris, France, on 8 October 2001 at Linate Airport in Milan, Italy. All 114 people on both aircraft were killed, as well as four people on the ground.

The subsequent investigation determined that the collision was caused by several nonfunctioning and nonconforming safety systems, standards, and procedures at the airport. It remains the deadliest accident in Italian aviation history.

==Aircraft and crew==
The collision involved two airlines; SAS and Air Evex. The larger of the two aircraft was a McDonnell-Douglas MD-87. The cockpit crew consisted of Captain Joakim Gustafsson and First Officer Anders Hyllander, both aged 36. Gustafsson had been hired by SAS in 1990 and had more than 5,800 hours of flight time. He had logged approximately 230 hours in the MD-87. Hyllander was hired by the airline in 1997. At the time of the accident, he had more than 4,300 total flying hours. He was more experienced in the aircraft type than his captain, having logged 2,000 hours of flight time in the MD-87.

The second aircraft was a Cessna Citation 525-A. There were two German pilots aboard. The captain, 36-year-old Horst Königsmann, had approximately 5,000 total flight hours logged, of which roughly 2,400 were accumulated in the Citation. The first officer, 64-year-old Martin Schneider, had approximately 12,000 flight hours&#x27; experience, of which 2,000 hours were in the Citation. One of the passengers was Luca Fossati, chairman of Star – Stabilimento Alimentare S.p.A. and owner of the Citation.

==Accident==
The accident occurred in thick fog, with visibility reduced to less than . The Cessna Citation was instructed to taxi from the western apron along the northern taxiway (taxiway R5), and then via the northern apron to the main taxiway which runs parallel to Runway 36R, a route that would have kept it clear of 36R. Instead, the pilot taxied along the southern taxi route (taxiway R6), crossing Runway 36R towards the main taxiway which lay beyond it (see diagram).

At 08:09:28, the MD-87 was given clearance by a different controller to take off from Runway 36R. Fifty-three seconds later, the MD-87 aircraft, travelling at about , collided with the Cessna. One of the four people in the Cessna was killed on impact; the remaining three initially survived the crash but died from burn injuries. The MD-87 lost its right engine; the pilot, Joakim Gustafsson, attempted to take off, reaching an altitude of approximately . The remaining engine lost some thrust due to debris ingestion, and the plane having lost the right landing gear, came down. It impacted the ground with its right wing, causing it to separate and fire to spill out from its place as the MD-87 skidded. Gustafsson applied thrust reverser and brakes and tried to guide the plane through its control surfaces. This was insufficient to halt the jet&#x27;s momentum, and it crashed into a luggage hangar located near the runway&#x27;s end, at a speed of approximately . In the impact, all the MD-87&#x27;s crew and passengers were killed. The crash and subsequent fire killed four Italian ground personnel in the hangar and injured four more.

Of the occupants of the MD-87, 54 (46%), mainly in the back of the aircraft, suffered severe burns; their bodies were identified using forensic dentistry or DNA records. Those in the front of the aircraft suffered severe blunt trauma. All of the occupants of the MD-87 were killed by impact, not fire.

==Causes==
The accident occurred less than a month after the September 11 attacks and the day after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan began, but the Italian government was quick to rule out a terrorist attack as the cause. This was subsequently confirmed by the investigations that followed.

The accident was investigated by the National Agency for the Safety of Flight (ANSV). The ANSV&#x27;s final report was published on 20 January 2004 and concluded that the &quot;immediate cause&quot; of the accident was the incursion of the Cessna aircraft onto the active runway. However, the ANSV stopped short of placing the blame entirely on the Cessna pilots, who had become lost in the fog. Their report identified deficiencies in the airport layout and procedures.

Linate Airport was operating without a functioning ground radar system at the time, despite having had a new system approved on 30 March 1995. The previous system had been decommissioned on 29 November 1999, but the replacement had not been fully installed. The new system came online a few months later. Guidance signs along the taxiways were obscured, or badly worn, and were later found not to meet regulations. After the pilots mistakenly turned onto the R6 taxiway that led to the runway, there were no signs by which they could recognize where they were. When they stopped at a taxiway stop-marking, and correctly reported its identifier, S4, the ground controller disregarded this identification because it was not on his maps and was unknown to him. Motion sensing runway incursion alarms were present, but had been deactivated to prevent false alarms from ground vehicles or animals. The ground controller&#x27;s verbal directions used terminology to designate aprons, taxiways, and runways, which did not match their on-the-ground signage and labels. Lastly, neither pilot of the Cessna was certified for landings with visibility less than , but had landed at the airport an hour before the disaster with a visibility reported by air traffic control of .

==Aftermath==
On 16 April 2004, a Milan court found four people guilty for the disaster. Airport director Vincenzo Fusco and air-traffic controller Paolo Zacchetti were both sentenced to eight years in prison. Francesco Federico, former head of the airport, and Sandro Gualano, former head of the air traffic control agency, received sentences of six and a half years. The pardon law issued by the Italian Parliament on 29 July 2006 reduced all convictions by three years. On 7 July 2006, Fusco and Federico were acquitted by the Milan Appeals Court. The controller Zacchetti&#x27;s sentence was reduced to three years. In addition three more people were sentenced for multiple manslaughter and negligent disaster: former ENAV director general Fabio Marzocca to four years and four months, and former SEA airports agency officials Antonio Cavanna and Lorenzo Grecchi each to three years and three months. On 20 February 2008 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the acquittal of Fusco and Federico and confirmed five convictions. (Initially, in late 2002, eleven officials and functionaries had been charged with manslaughter.)

The initial eight-year sentence for Zacchetti prompted outrage among air traffic controllers. His sentence has been questioned in aviation safety law commentary.

==Victims==


Victims of the crash included nationals of nine different countries. Most of the victims were Italian and Scandinavian.

Four memorial services were held in honour of the SAS MD-87 victims. On 12 October, three separate ceremonies were held, with one in Denmark, one in Norway, and one in Sweden. On 13 October, a fourth ceremony was held in Italy.

In March 2002, a forest containing 118 beech trees called &quot;Beech Forest (&quot;&quot;)&quot; was inaugurated as a memorial to the victims in the Forlanini Park near the airport. A sculpture by the Swedish artist Christer Bording donated by SAS, called &quot;Infinity Pain&quot;, was placed in the centre of the forest.

The disaster devastated the Swedish go-kart community as some of the country&#x27;s most promising young drivers were on the flight after attending an event in Parma. After the disaster, the Swedish national motorsports club started a memorial fund together with some of the relatives. The fund awards annual stipends to promising Swedish youth in go-kart.

== Dramatization ==
In 2012 the accident was featured on the 11th season of the Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic TV series &quot;Mayday&quot;, in an episode entitled &quot;The Invisible Plane&quot;. The episode featured interviews with accident investigators, and a dramatization of the crash and investigation.

<doc id="293639" wikidata="Q845727" url="?curid=293639" title="Lift-to-drag ratio">
<text>In aerodynamics, the lift-to-drag ratio (or L/D ratio) is the lift generated by an aerodynamic body such as an aerofoil or aircraft, divided by the aerodynamic drag caused by moving through air. It describes the aerodynamic efficiency under given flight conditions. The L/D ratio for any given body will vary according to these flight conditions.

For an aerofoil wing or powered aircraft, the L/D is specified when in straight and level flight. For a glider it determines the glide ratio, of distance travelled against loss of height.

The term is calculated for any particular airspeed by measuring the lift generated, then dividing by the drag at that speed. These vary with speed, so the results are typically plotted on a 2-dimensional graph. In almost all cases the graph forms a U-shape, due to the two main components of drag. The L/D may be calculated using computational fluid dynamics or computer simulation. It is measured empirically by testing in a wind tunnel or in free flight test.

The L/D ratio is affected by both the form drag of the body and by the induced drag associated with creating a lifting force. It depends principally on the lift and drag coefficients, angle of attack to the airflow and the wing aspect ratio.

The L/D ratio is inversely proportional to the energy required for a given flightpath, so that doubling the L/D ratio will require only half of the energy for the same distance travelled. This results directly in better fuel economy.

The L/D ratio can also be used for water craft and land vehicles. The L/D ratios for hydrofoil boats and displacement craft are determined similarly to aircraft.

==Lift and drag==

Lift can be created when an aerofoil-shaped body travels through a viscous fluid such as air. The aerofoil is often cambered and/or set at an angle of attack to the airflow. The lift then increases as the square of the airspeed.

Whenever an aerodynamic body generates lift, this also creates lift-induced drag or induced drag. At low speeds an aircraft has to generate lift with a higher angle of attack, which results in a greater induced drag. This term dominates the low-speed side of the graph of lift versus velocity.

Form drag is caused by movement of the body through air. This type of drag, known also as air resistance or profile drag varies with the square of speed (see drag equation). For this reason profile drag is more pronounced at greater speeds, forming the right side of the lift/velocity graph&#x27;s U shape. Profile drag is lowered primarily by streamlining and reducing cross section.

The total drag on any aerodynamic body thus has two components, induced drag and form drag.

===Lift and drag coefficients===
The rates of change of lift and drag with angle of attack (AoA) are called respectively the lift and drag coefficients CL and CD. The varying ratio of lift to drag with AoA is often plotted in terms of these coefficients.

For any given value of lift, the AoA varies with speed. Graphs of CL and CD vs. speed are referred to as drag curves. Speed is shown increasing from left to right. The lift/drag ratio is given by the slope from the origin to some point on the curve and so the maximum L/D ratio does not occur at the point of least drag coefficient, the leftmost point. Instead, it occurs at a slightly greater speed. Designers will typically select a wing design which produces an L/D peak at the chosen cruising speed for a powered fixed-wing aircraft, thereby maximizing economy. Like all things in aeronautical engineering, the lift-to-drag ratio is not the only consideration for wing design. Performance at a high angle of attack and a gentle stall are also important.

==Glide ratio==
As the aircraft fuselage and control surfaces will also add drag and possibly some lift, it is fair to consider the L/D of the aircraft as a whole. The glide ratio, which is the ratio of an (unpowered) aircraft&#x27;s forward motion to its descent, is (when flown at constant speed) numerically equal to the aircraft&#x27;s L/D. This is especially of interest in the design and operation of high performance sailplanes, which can have glide ratios almost 60 to 1 (60 units of distance forward for each unit of descent) in the best cases, but with 30:1 being considered good performance for general recreational use. Achieving a glider&#x27;s best L/D in practice requires precise control of airspeed and smooth and restrained operation of the controls to reduce drag from deflected control surfaces. In zero wind conditions, L/D will equal distance traveled divided by altitude lost. Achieving the maximum distance for altitude lost in wind conditions requires further modification of the best airspeed, as does alternating cruising and thermaling. To achieve high speed across country, glider pilots anticipating strong thermals often load their gliders (sailplanes) with water ballast: the increased wing loading means optimum glide ratio at greater airspeed, but at the cost of climbing more slowly in thermals. As noted below, the maximum L/D is not dependent on weight or wing loading, but with greater wing loading the maximum L/D occurs at a faster airspeed. Also, the faster airspeed means the aircraft will fly at greater Reynolds number and this will usually bring about a lower zero-lift drag coefficient.

==Theory==
===Subsonic===
Mathematically, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio can be estimated as
: formula_1
where AR is the aspect ratio, formula_2 the span efficiency factor, a number less than but close to unity for long, straight-edged wings, and formula_3 the zero-lift drag coefficient.

Most importantly, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio is independent of the weight of the aircraft, the area of the wing, or the wing loading.

It can be shown that two main drivers of maximum lift-to-drag ratio for a fixed wing aircraft are wingspan and total wetted area. One method for estimating the zero-lift drag coefficient of an aircraft is the equivalent skin-friction method. For a well designed aircraft, zero-lift drag (or parasite drag) is mostly made up of skin friction drag plus a small percentage of pressure drag caused by flow separation. The method uses the equation
: formula_4
where formula_5 is the equivalent skin friction coefficient, formula_6 is the wetted area and formula_7 is the wing reference area. The equivalent skin friction coefficient accounts for both separation drag and skin friction drag and is a fairly consistent value for aircraft types of the same class. Substituting this into the equation for maximum lift-to-drag ratio, along with the equation for aspect ratio (formula_8), yields the equation
formula_9
where &quot;b&quot; is wingspan. The term formula_10 is known as the wetted aspect ratio. The equation demonstrates the importance of wetted aspect ratio in achieving an aerodynamically efficient design.

===Supersonic===
At supersonic speeds L/D values are lower. Concorde had a lift/drag ratio of about 7 at Mach 2, whereas a 747 has about 17 at about mach 0.85.

Dietrich Küchemann developed an empirical relationship for predicting L/D ratio for high Mach numbers:
: formula_11
where &quot;M&quot; is the Mach number. Windtunnel tests have shown this to be approximately accurate.

<doc id="293643" wikidata="Q1675753" url="?curid=293643" title="Ivinghoe Beacon">
<text>Ivinghoe Beacon is a prominent hill and landmark in Buckinghamshire, England, 233 m (757 ft) above sea level in the Chiltern Hills, close to Ivinghoe and Aldbury. Dunstable, Berkhamsted and Tring are nearby.

The Beacon lies within the Ashridge Estate and is managed and owned by the National Trust. It is the starting point of the Icknield Way to the east, and the Ridgeway long-distance path to the west.
Ivinghoe Beacon is a popular spot for walkers and sightseers. Model aircraft enthusiasts also use lift generated by the wind blowing up the hill to fly their unpowered aircraft – a technique known as slope soaring.

==History==
The hill is an ancient signal point, which was used in times of crisis to send messages across long distances. It is also the site of an early Iron Age hillfort protected as a scheduled monument.

Archaeological evidence has revealed human activity dating back to the Bronze Age, and the area contains many other scheduled Monuments, including a number of Bronze Age burial mounds and the faint remains of an Iron Age hillfort at the top of the hill. There also exists evidence of ancient farming as the Beacon is also crossed by deep channels which are thought to be cattle drovers&#x27; paths and cross-ridge dykes. The prehistoric earthwork, Grim&#x27;s Ditch passes to the south of the Beacon at Incombe Hole.

==Nature==
Ivinghoe Beacon is part of the Ivinghoe Hills Site of Special Scientific Interest and this area forms part of the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

The chalk grassland supports a range of wildlife. A number of wild flower species grow on the Beacon such as rare types of wild orchid and pasque-flower, and these support endangered butterfly species such as the Duke of Burgundy.

==Filming location==
Ivinghoe Beacon&#x27;s appearance of remoteness, yet relative proximity to the film studios at Elstree and Leavesden, has made it a popular choice as a filming location. It has been used as a location for many dramas, especially those produced by ITC in the 1960s.

The Beacon has been used as a filming location in four &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films – &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;. The Beacon also appeared in the 2012 BBC adaptation of Richard II. In 2018 film crews shot scenes on Ivinghoe Beacon for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;.

<doc id="293645" wikidata="Q345544" url="?curid=293645" title="Kilij Arslan I">
<text>Kilij Arslan ibn Suleiman (; ; or &quot;Kılıcarslan&quot;, &quot;Sword Lion&quot;) (‎1079–1107) was the Seljuq Sultan of Rum from 1092 until his death in 1107. He ruled the Sultanate during the time of the First Crusade and thus faced the earliest attacks from Christian forces. He also re-established the Sultanate of Rum after the death of Malik Shah I of the Seljuk Empire and defeated the Crusaders in three battles during the Crusade of 1101. Kilij Arslan was the first Muslim and Turkish commander to fight against the Crusaders, commanding his horse archers as a teenager.

==Rise to power==
After the death of his father, Suleiman ibn Qutalmish, in 1086, he became a hostage of Sultan Malik Shah I of Great Seljuq in Isfahan, but was released when Malik Shah died in 1092 in the wake of a quarrel among his jailers. Kilij Arslan then marched at the head of the Turkish Oghuz Yiva tribe army and set up his capital at Nicaea, replacing Amin &#x27;l Ghazni, the governor appointed by Malik Shah I.

Following the death of Malik Shah I the individual tribes, the Danishmends, Mangujekids, Saltuqids, Tengribirmish begs, Artuqids (Ortoqids) and Akhlat-Shahs, had started vying with each other to establish their own independent states. Alexius Comnenus&#x27;s Byzantine intrigues further complicated the situation. He married Ayşe Hatun, the daughter of the Emir Tzachas to attempt to ally himself against the Byzantines, who commanded a strong naval fleet. They had four sons: Malik Shah, Mesud I, Arab and Toghrul. In 1094, Kilij Arslan received a letter from Alexius suggesting that the Tzachas sought to target him to move onto the Byzantines, thereupon Kilij Arslan marched with an army to Smyrna, Tzachas&#x27;s capital, and invited his father-in-law to a banquet in his tent where he slew him while he was intoxicated.

==The Crusades==
===People&#x27;s Crusade===

The People&#x27;s Crusade (also called the Peasants&#x27; Crusade) army of Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless arrived at Nicaea in 1096. A German contingent of the crusade overran the castle Xerigordon and held it until Kilij sent a force to starve them out. Those that renounced Christianity were spared and sent into captivity to the east, the rest were put to death. Kilij Arslan also cunningly sent spies to trick the Crusaders into thinking Xerigordon was ripe for the taking, and the ill-disciplined Crusaders rushed to Xerigordon despite orders against this. They were consequently ambushed, forcing Peter the Hermit eventually to give up the crusade.

The remainder of Peter&#x27;s crusade composed almost entirely of unarmed civilians was surprised near the village of Civetot by Kilij Arslan&#x27;s army. They were easily overwhelmed and around 17,000 out of the 20,000 remaining Christians died. He then invaded the Danishmend Emirate of Malik Ghazi in eastern Anatolia.

The First Crusade would start a few months later.

===First Crusade===
Because of this easy first victory he did not consider the main crusader army, led by various nobles of western Europe, to be a serious threat. He resumed his war with the Danishmends, and was away from Nicaea when these new Crusaders besieged Nicaea in May 1097. He hurried back to his capital to find it surrounded by the Crusaders, and was defeated in battle with them on 21 May. The city then surrendered to the Byzantines and his wife and children were captured. When the crusaders sent the Sultan&#x27;s wife to Constantinople, to their dismay she was later returned without ransom in 1097 because of the relationship between Kilij Arslan and Alexios I Komnenos.

As result of the stronger invasion, Rum and the Danishmends allied in their attempt to turn back the crusaders. The Crusaders continued to split their forces as they marched across Anatolia. The combined Danishmend and Rum forces planned to ambush the Crusaders near Dorylaeum on 29 June. However, Kilij Arslan&#x27;s horse archers could not penetrate the line of defense set up by the Crusader knights, and the main body under Bohemond arrived to capture the Turkish camp on 1 July. In this battle, the Kilij Arslan and his troops won the respect of his enemy, as the &quot;Gesta Francorum&quot; states: &quot;had the Turks been Christian, they would be the finest of all races.&quot;

Kilij Arslan was defeated and settled for harassing the Crusader army with guerilla warfare and hit-and-run tactics. He also destroyed crops and water sources along their route in order to hinder the Crusader Army from collecting supplies, ultimately with little success.

===Crusade of 1101===

Gazi Gümüshtigin captured Bohemond resulting in a new force of Lombards attempting to rescue him. In their march they took Ankara from Arslan upon the Danishmends. In alliance with Radwan the Atabeg of Aleppo he ambushed this force at the Battle of Mersivan. In 1101 he defeated another Crusader army at Heraclea Cybistra, which had come to assist the fledgling Crusader states in Syria. This was an important victory for the Turks, as it proved that an army of Crusader knights was not invincible. After this victory he moved his capital to Konya and defeated a force led by William II of Nevers who attempted to march upon it as well as the subsequent force a week later.

In 1104 he resumed his war with the Danishmends who were now weakened after the death of Malik Ghazi, demanding half the ransom gained for Bohemond. As a result, Bohemond allied with the Danishmends against Rum and the Byzantines.

==War and drowning in river==
After the crusades he moved towards the east, taking Harran and Diyarbakr. In 1107 he conquered Mosul, but he was defeated by Muhammad I Tapar supported by Ilghazi of the Artuqids and Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan of Aleppo at the battle of Khabur River. Having lost the battle, Kilij Arslan drowned trying to escape across the river.

==Discovery of his burial==
In January 2021, archaeologists led by professor Ahmet Tanyıldız from the Dicle University discovered his and his daughter Saide Hatun&#x27;s grave in Silvan, Diyarbakır. Researchers dug two metres deep across a 35-square-metre area and focused their works on two gravesites in Orta Çeşme Park.

<doc id="293646" wikidata="Q1507369" url="?curid=293646" title="George Francis Train">
<text>George Francis Train (March 24, 1829 – January 18, 1904) was an American businessman who organized the clipper ship line that sailed around Cape Horn to San Francisco; he also organized the Union Pacific Railroad and the Credit Mobilier in the United States in 1864 to construct the eastern portion of the Transcontinental Railroad, and a horse tramway company in England while there during the American Civil War.

In 1870 Train made the first of three widely publicized trips around the globe. He believed that a report of his first journey in a French periodical inspired Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days;&quot; protagonist Phileas Fogg may have been modeled on him.

In 1872, he ran for president of the United States as an independent candidate. That year, he was jailed on obscenity charges while defending suffragist Victoria Woodhull against charges regarding an article her newspaper had published on an alleged adulterous affair. Despite business successes in early life, he was known as an increasingly eccentric figure in American and Australian history. 

==Early life and education==
George Francis Train was born on March 24, 1829, in Boston, son of Oliver Train and his wife Maria Pickering. His cousin Adeline later became a noted author. His parents and three sisters died in a yellow fever epidemic in New Orleans in 1833 when George was four. He was raised by strict Methodist grandparents in Boston. They hoped George would become a minister. 

He attended common schools, where he acquired knowledge about different countries, got exposed to logical ways of thinking, and honed mechanical engineering skills using toy blocks and sticks. His best friend in school had immigrated from England, and related to Train how difficult it was to get around in his hometown, Birkenhead. This is what inspired Train to set up a tramway system in the same town. He did not go into the ministry, instead becoming a businessman and adventure seeker.

==Career==
Train entered the mercantile business in Boston, and made it his career all his life in the United States, Britain and in Australia. He initiated numerous new businesses, building the corporate and financial structures to make them work.

===Australia===
He and his wife arrived in Melbourne on 23 May 1853 aboard the &quot;Bavaria&quot;, where he became the local agent for the White Diamond Line. In partnership with another American, former mariner Captain Ebenezer Caldwell, he imported clothing, building materials, guns, flour, patent medicines, mining tools, coaches and carts. Caldwell, Train &amp; Co. built warehouses at either end of the newly constructed railway line from Sandridge to Flinders St, making it easier for White Star Line passengers to move their luggage between port and city. He was involved in the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce and he helped establish a volunteer fire brigade in the city.

Train&#x27;s wife returned to Boston in 1854 to give birth to their daughter. He left Australia in November 1855 to join her, travelling via the Orient and the Middle East.

===Britain===
In 1860 he went to England to found horse tramway companies in Birkenhead and London, where he soon met opposition. He was also involved in the construction of a short-lived horse tramway in Cork, Ireland. Although his trams were popular with passengers, his designs had rails that stood above the road surface and obstructed other traffic. In 1861 Train was arrested and tried for &quot;breaking and injuring&quot; Uxbridge Road in London. He tried again with the Staffordshire Potteries Street Railway Company in 1861 and then with the Darlington Street Railroad Company in 1862, but the latter was short-lived, closing in 1865.

===United States===
Train was involved in the formation of the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) in 1864 during the American Civil War. The federal government chartered the railroad for construction of the portion of the Transcontinental Railroad west of the Missouri River. Train helped set up the shadow finance company for the project, the Credit Mobilier of America, whose principal officers were the same as those of UP. (See below)

That year, he left the United States for England. Referring to himself as &quot;Citizen Train&quot;, Train became a shipping magnate, a prolific writer, a minor presidential candidate after return to the United States, and a confidant of French and Australian revolutionaries. He claimed to have been offered the presidency of a proposed Australian republic, but declined. During the American Civil War, he gave numerous speeches in England in favor of the Union and denounced the Confederacy.

In 1868 Train was arrested while aboard the RMS &quot;Scotia&quot; in the port of Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland, and held in custody. He had in his possession speeches he had given in the United States in defense of the Fenian cause of Irish independence. These documents were seized by a local magistrate. His release four days later was on condition that he disavow any intention of promoting Fenianism while in Ireland or England.

In the middle of his campaign for president in 1870, Train decided to make a trip around the globe, which was covered by many newspapers. The actual traveling took 80 days, though he stayed two months in France, supporting the Paris Commune, for which he spent two weeks in jail (the US government and Alexandre Dumas intervened to get him released).
His exploits possibly inspired Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days;&quot; the protagonist Phileas Fogg is believed to have been partially modeled on Train.

While in Europe after his 1870 trip, Train met with the Grand Duke Constantine. During that period, he persuaded the Queen of Spain to back construction of a railway in the backwoods of Pennsylvania. Her support provided funding for the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad. He promoted and built tramways in Britain after opposition which he overcame by agreeing to run the rails level with the streets.

On his return to the U.S., Train&#x27;s popularity and reputation soared. He began promoting the Union Pacific Railroad, with which he had been involved for several years, despite the advice of Vanderbilt, who told him it would never work. Forming a finance company called Credit Foncier of America, Train made a fortune from real estate when the transcontinental railway opened up for colonization huge swaths of western America, including large amounts of land in Council Bluffs, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska; and Columbus, Nebraska. He was responsible for building the Cozzens Hotel and founding Train Town in Omaha.

Train was noted for having created the Credit Mobilier in 1864, started to finance the Union Pacific. While appearing to be a separate, independent company which Union Pacific hired, Crédit Mobilier was staffed by the same officers as the railroad. Train and others created a structure that allowed them to realize outsize profits during the railroad&#x27;s construction. The story about this scam and congressional graft was broken in 1872 by &quot;The Sun&quot;, a New York newspaper opposed to the re-election of Ulysses S. Grant for president. Eventually the scandals resulted in congressional and executive federal investigations which implicated numerous congressmen, including James Garfield. Denying the charges, Grant was re-elected as president.

In 1872, Train ran for president of the United States as an independent candidate. He was a supporter of the temperance movement. That year, he was jailed on obscenity charges while defending Victoria Woodhull for her newspaper&#x27;s reporting of the alleged adulterous affair of abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher and Elizabeth Tilton. He was the primary financier of the newspaper &quot;The Revolution&quot;, which was dedicated to women&#x27;s rights and published by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

==Later years==
As he aged, Train seemingly became more eccentric. In 1873, he was arrested and threatened with institutionalization in an insane asylum.

He stood for the position of dictator of the United States, charged admission fees to campaign rallies, and drew record crowds. He became a vegetarian and adopted various fads. Instead of shaking hands with other people, he shook hands with himself, a manner of greeting he claimed to have seen in China. He spent his final days on park benches in New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Park, handing out dimes and refusing to speak to anyone but children and animals.

In 1890, Nellie Bly traveled around the world in 72 days, instigating Train to do a second circumnavigation of the earth in the same year. He completed the trip from Tacoma, Washington, and back in 67 days 12 hours and 1 minute, a world record at the time. A plaque in Tacoma commemorates the location where the 1890 trip began and ended. Train was accompanied on many of his travels by George Pickering Bemis, his cousin and private secretary. Bemis was later elected as mayor of Omaha, Nebraska.

In 1892, the town of Whatcom, Washington, offered to finance yet another trip around the world in order to publicize itself. Train finished this trip in a record 60 days.

He became ill with smallpox while visiting his daughter Susan M. Train Gulager in Stamford, Connecticut, in 1903.

On January 5, 1904, Train died of heart failure in New York. At the time of his death, he was living in a cheap lodging house named the Mills Hotel. He was buried at a small private ceremony at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. After his death, The Thirteen Club, of which he was a member, passed a resolution that he was one of the few sane men in &quot;a mad, mad world.&quot;

==Marriage and family==

Train married Wilhelmina Wilkinson Davis in 1851, with whom he had four children, including daughter Susan M. Train Gulager.

In 1869, Train erected a large Italianate summer cottage in Newport, Rhode Island. Known as Train Villa, it stood at Bellevue Avenue at Bailey&#x27;s Beach. After Train&#x27;s death, it was renamed Beachholm. It was destroyed by fire in the 1970s.

<text>Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget () is a Swedish timber, pulp and paper manufacturer with headquarters in Sundsvall. It has approximately 3,300 employees and a turnover of approximately SEK 20.8 billion (€1.8 billion). Its main products include many one-use paper products, containerboard, solid-wood products, pulp and forest-based biofuel. SCA is Europe&#x27;s largest private owner of forest land, with 2.7 million hectares. The global hygiene product company Essity was part of SCA until 2017.

==History==
SCA was founded by Ivar Kreuger on 27 November 1929 as a holding company for ten Swedish forest industry companies. Following Kreuger&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1932, the company came to be controlled by the bank Handelsbanken, who along with associated funds and companies continue to control SCA. Axel Enström was the managing director from 1950 to 1960 and chairman of the board from 1960 to 1965.

In 1975 SCA acquired Mölnlycke, a leading western European producer of disposable hygiene products, and in 1990 SCA acquired transport packaging company Reedpack. In 1995 the Germany-based paper and packaging company PWA was acquired. In 2001 the division Wisconsin Tissue of the United States company Georgia-Pacific Tissue was acquired. 

In 2007, SCA bought the European business of Procter &amp; Gamble, significantly expanding its hygiene product business. In 2008 SCA increases ownership in Chinese tissue company Vinda. In 2012 SCA divested its packaging operations – excluding the two kraftliner mills in Sweden – to DS Smith.

In August 2015 it was announced that SCA was to invest in increased capacity for mass production at the Östrand pulp mill in Timrå, Sweden. The annual production capacity of bleached sulphate pulp was to increase from approximately 430 000 tonnes to 900 000 tonnes. The investment amounted to approximately SEK 7.8 billion (€815m) and was expected to be one of the largest industrial investment in the history of Norrland.

In August 2015 it was announced that SCA&#x27;s hygiene operations and forest operations were to be divided into two different divisions. A year later, 24 August 2016, the company announced that it intended to split SCA into two separately listed companies. In 2017 the company Essity was formed and was introduced on the Stock Exchange in Stockholm.

In September 2021, St1 and SCA announced their half-owned joint ventures St1 Gothenburg Biorefinery AB and SCA Östrand Biorefinery. The biorefinery in Gothenburg produces biofuel from pine oil from SCA and other renewable raw materials

== Business ==
SCA&#x27;s operations are divided in five business areas: Forest, Wood, Containerboard, Pulp and Renewable energy.

SCA is present in the Netherlands and Germany in logistics and in the Baltics within the business area SCA Forest. The company has no operations in Russia or Ukraine.

=== Forest holdings ===
SCA is Europe&#x27;s largest private owner of forest land and manages a total of around 2.6 million hectares in northern Sweden, of which two million hectares of productive forest land, which corresponds to up to nine percent of Sweden&#x27;s total productive forest land. The company also has forests in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which are responsible for managing their own forests, felling and purchasing timber in order to supply SCA&#x27;s industries with raw material. SCA uses its forest to produce wood-based products such as sawn timber, paper pulp and packaging paper (kraftliner). The company owns wind turbines and produces solid and liquid biofuels from its by-products. The company also provides services for forest owners and transport solutions.

== Sustainability ==
SCA is nominated for sustainable forestry and certified products. Continuous work is underway to strengthen biological diversity and secure functional ecosystems. In 2014, the Ethisphere Institute selected SCA as one of the world&#x27;s most ethical companies for the seventh time in a row. There are several perceptions of what sustainable forestry is.

<text>The Anarchist Federation (AF, AFed) is a federation of anarcho-communists in Great Britain. It is not a political party, but a direct action, agitational and propaganda organisation.

==History==
The British anarchist movement had been revitalized during the time of the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–1985, which had drawn many new people to anarchism and caused a number of anarchist organizations to spring up in the wake of Class War. In 1984, a number of former members of the Libertarian Communist Group established the Libertarian Communist Discussion Group (LCDG), drawing inspiration from texts such as the &quot;Platform&quot; by Nestor Makhno and the &quot;Manifesto of Libertarian Communism&quot; by Georges Fontenis. The LCDG then began to collaborate with the editor of &quot;Virus&quot; magazine and started publishing their own texts about anarcho-communism, changing their name again to the Anarchist Communist Discussion Group (ACDG). After the split of Syndicalist Fight (SyF) from the Direct Action Movement (DAM) in 1986, the ACDG merged together with SyF and established the Anarchist Communist Federation (ACF).

Throughout the late-1980s, the ACF drew together many people that were new to anarchism, which effectively made it into an entirely new organization, almost completely disconnected from its roots. At the beginning of the 1990s, they participated in the poll tax riots, calling for &quot;the abolition of all hierarchy&quot; and &quot;the creation of a worldwide classless society&quot;. According to one report by the Economic League in 1991, the ACF had quickly become &quot;second only to Class War&quot; in terms of its &quot;militancy and commitment to violence&quot;. Although a small organization, much of the ACF&#x27;s influence came from its &quot;cordial relationships&quot; with other libertarian socialist groups, cooperating particularly closely with the autonomous Marxists of Subversion. In 1999, the ACF changed its name one final time, becoming the Anarchist Federation (AF). According to an interview with founding members of the AF, this was in order to shorten the name and to clarify that it was not an alliance of anarchists with other forms of communists. 

By the turn of the 21st century, the AF were involved in the anti-globalization movement and participated in protests against rising third world debt. The Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police began investigating the AF, following 2000&#x27;s May Day demonstration at Parliament Square, during which some activists had dug up the grass to plant vegetables. In 2014, following a series of acts of vandalism and arson by green anarchists, a large police investigation was launched into Bristol&#x27;s anarchist community, to which the Bristol Anarchist Federation responded with a statement denouncing the police&#x27;s &quot;concerted effort to intimidate and divide&quot; local anarchists. In 2018, a &quot;class struggle&quot; anarchist faction within the AF split to form the Anarchist Communist Group (ACG) due to alleged support of &quot;identity politics&quot; within the AF. In February 2020, eco-socialist activists connected to the Anarchist Federation took part in the occupation of Paddington Green Police Station, but they were swiftly evicted.

==Publications==
The Anarchist Federation and its predecessors were responsible for publishing &quot;Virus&quot; magazine between 1984 and 1989, which ran for 13 issues before being replaced with a new magazine, &quot;Organise!&quot;, which has been published ever since.

==Ideology==
The Anarchist Federation propagates a theory of anarchist communism, distancing itself from individualist anarchism, anarcho-pacifism and anarcho-syndicalism. It had come to outright reject trade unionism during the suppression of the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–1985, which had caused it to question the role of the trade unions in a class conflict. It extends its skepticism of trade unions to any permanent workplace organizations, arguing they can become integrated into the functioning of capitalism.

The AF advocates for prefigurative politics, out of a belief in a &quot;strong correlation between means and ends&quot;, which rejects all politicians and political parties. It considers participation in representative democracy to be &quot;ceding political power to someone or some party&quot;, and thus favors direct action over electoralism. It further claims that Members of Parliament inevitably become corrupted by power and distant from their own communities.

<text>The Chiltern Hills or the Chilterns are a chalk escarpment in southern England, located to the north-west of London, covering across Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire; they stretch from Goring-on-Thames in the south-west to Hitchin in the north-east. The hills are at their widest.

In 1965, almost half of the Chilterns was designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The north-west boundary is clearly defined by the escarpment. The dip slope is by definition more gradual and merges with the landscape to the south-east. The south-west endpoint is the River Thames. The hills decline slowly in prominence in north-east Bedfordshire.

==Geology==

The chalk escarpment of the Chiltern Hills overlooks the Vale of Aylesbury and roughly coincides with the southernmost extent of the ice sheet during the Anglian glacial maximum. The Chilterns are part of a system of chalk downlands throughout eastern and southern England, formed between 65 and 95 million years ago, comprising rocks of the Chalk Group; this also includes Salisbury Plain, Cranborne Chase, the Isle of Wight and the South Downs in the south. In the north, the chalk formations continue northeastwards across Hertfordshire, Norfolk and the Lincolnshire Wolds, finally ending as the Yorkshire Wolds in a prominent escarpment, south of the Vale of Pickering. The beds of the Chalk Group were deposited over the buried northwestern margin of the Anglo-Brabant Massif during the Late Cretaceous. During this time, sources for siliciclastic sediment had been eliminated due to the exceptionally high sea level. The formation is thinner through the Chiltern Hills than the chalk strata to the north and south and deposition was tectonically controlled, with the Lilley Bottom structure playing a significant role at times. The Chalk Group, like the underlying Gault Clay and Upper Greensand, is diachronous.

During the late stages of the Alpine Orogeny, as the African Plate collided with Eurasian Plate, Mesozoic extensional structures, such as the Weald Basin of southern England, underwent structural inversion. This phase of deformation tilted the chalk strata to the southeast in the area of the Chiltern Hills. The gently dipping beds of rock were eroded, forming an escarpment.

The chalk strata are frequently interspersed with layers of flint nodules which apparently replaced chalk and infilled pore spaces early in the diagenetic history. Flint has been mined for millennia from the Chiltern Hills. They were first extracted for fabrication into flint axes in the Neolithic period, then for knapping into flintlocks. Nodules are to be seen everywhere in the older houses as a construction material for walls.

==Physical characteristics==

===Topography===

The highest point is at 267 m (876 ft.) above sea level at Haddington Hill near Wendover in Buckinghamshire; a stone monument marks the summit. The nearby Ivinghoe Beacon is a more prominent hill, although its altitude is only 249 m (817 ft.). It is the starting point of the Icknield Way Path and the Ridgeway long-distance path, which follows the line of the Chilterns for many miles to the west, where they merge with the Wiltshire downs and southern Cotswolds. To the east of Ivinghoe Beacon is Dunstable Downs, a steep section of the Chiltern scarp. Near Wendover is Coombe Hill, 260 m (852 ft.) above sea level. The more gently sloping country – the dip slope – to the southeast of the Chiltern scarp is also generally referred to as part of the Chilterns; it contains much beech woodland and many villages.
===Landscape and land use===
Enclosed fields account for almost 66% of the &quot;Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty&quot; (AONB) area. The next most important, and archetypal, landscape form is woodland, covering 21% of the Chilterns, which is thus one of the most heavily wooded areas in England. Built-up areas (settlements and industry) make up over 5% of the land area; parks and gardens nearly 4%, open land (commons, heaths and downland) is 2%, and the remaining 2% includes a variety of uses, including communications, military, open land, recreation, utilities and water.

===Rivers===
The Chilterns are almost entirely located within the River Thames drainage basin, and also drain towards several major Thames tributaries, most notably the Lea, which rises in the eastern Chilterns, the Colne to the south, and the Thame to the north and west. Other rivers arising near the Chilterns include the Mimram, the Ver, the Gade, the Bulbourne, the Chess, the Misbourne and the Wye. These are classified as chalk streams, although the Lea is degraded by water from road drains and sewage treatment works. The Thames flows through a gap between the Berkshire Downs and the Chilterns. Portions around Leighton Buzzard and Hitchin are drained by the Ouzel, the Flit and the Hiz, all of which ultimately flow into the River Great Ouse (the last two via the Ivel).

===Transport===
Several transport routes pass through the Chilterns in natural or human-made corridors. There are also over of public footpaths in the Chilterns, including long-distance trackways such as the Icknield Way and The Ridgeway. The M40 motorway passes through the Chilterns in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire sections with a deep cutting through the Stokenchurch Gap. The M1 motorway crosses the Bedfordshire section near Luton. Other major roads include the A41 and the A413.

The Chiltern Main Line Railway via High Wycombe and Princes Risborough, the London to Aylesbury Line via , the West Coast Main Line via Berkhamsted, and the Midland Main Line all run through the Chiltern Hills. The Great Western Main Line and its branches such as the Henley and Marlow branch lines link the southern side of the Chilterns with London Paddington. The Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway is a preserved line.

High Speed 2 (HS2) will pass underneath the Chilterns in the Chiltern tunnel. This tunnel, the longest under construction on the HS2 route, will be in length. The Conservation Board has made clear it was opposed to the routing of HS2 through the Chilterns AONB.

Bus services are provided by Arriva Shires &amp; Essex and Carousel Buses. Air corridors from Luton Airport pass over the Chilterns.

Apart from the River Thames, there are no navigable rivers. The Grand Union Canal passes through the Chilterns between Berkhamsted and Marsworth following the course of the Gade and Bulbourne. Also, after crossing a watershed, the Ouzel is partly in the Chilterns.

==History==
During the Iron Age, the Chiltern ridge provided a relatively safe and easily navigable route across southern Britain.
The toponym, &quot;Chiltern&quot;, is believed to be Brittonic in origin. According to Eilert Ekwall, &quot;Chiltern&quot; is possibly related to the broader ethnic name &quot;Celt&quot; (&quot;Celtæ&quot; in early Celtic languages); the root &quot;celto-&quot; &quot;high&quot; (and suffix &quot;-erno-&quot;) could provide the origin of &quot;Chiltern&quot;.

Before the 18th century, the population lived dispersed across the largely rural landscape of the Chilterns in remote villages, hamlets, farmsteads, and market towns along the main turnpike routes which coursed through the navigable valleys. The development of canals in the 18th century and railways in the 19th century encouraged settlement and the growth of High Wycombe, Tring, and Luton. Significant housing and industrial development took place in the first half of the 20th century and continued throughout the 20th century.

In 1965 almost half of the Chiltern Hills was designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

==Economic use==
The hills have been used for their natural resources for millennia. The chalk has been quarried for the manufacture of cement, and flint for local building material. Beechwoods supplied furniture makers with quality hardwood. The area was once (and still is to a lesser degree) renowned for its chair-making industry, centred on the towns of Chesham and High Wycombe (the nickname of Wycombe Wanderers Football Club is the Chairboys). Water was and remains a scarce resource in the Chilterns. Historically it was drawn from the aquifer via ponds, deep wells, occasional springs or bournes and chalk streams and rivers. The River Chess directly supplies watercress beds. Today the chalk aquifer is exploited via a network of pumping stations to provide a public supply for domestic consumption, agriculture and business uses, both within and well-beyond the Chilterns area. Over-exploitation has possibly led to the disappearance of some streams over long periods.

In a region without building stone, local clay provided the raw materials for brick manufacture. Timber and flint were also used for construction.

Mediaeval strip parishes reflected the diversity of land from clay farmland, through wooded slopes to downland. Their boundaries were often drawn to include a section of each type of land, resulting in an irregular county boundary. These have tended to be smoothed out by successive reorganisations.

As people have come to appreciate the open country, the area has become a visitor destination and the National Trust has acquired land to preserve its character, for example at Ashridge, near Tring. In places, with the reduction of sheep grazing, action has been taken to maintain open downland by suppressing the natural growth of scrub and birch woodland. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Youth Hostels Association established several youth hostels for people visiting the hills.

The hills have been used as a location for telecommunication relay stations such as Stokenchurch BT Tower and that at Zouches Farm.

==Protection==

The Chilterns are an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and so enjoys special protection from major developments, which should not take place in such areas except in exceptional circumstances. This protection applies to major development proposals that raise issues of national significance. In 2000 the government confirmed that the landscape qualities of AONBs are equivalent to those of National Parks, and that the protection given to both types of area by the land use planning system should also be equivalent.

===Chilterns Conservation Board===
The Chilterns Conservation Board was established by Parliamentary Order in July 2004. It is an independent body comprising 27 members drawn from the relevant local authorities and from those living in local communities within the Chiltern AONB area.

The Board&#x27;s purposes are set out in Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000: In summary these are:- First, to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the AONB, and increase the understanding and enjoyment by the public of the special qualities of the AONB. Second, while taking account of the first purpose, to foster the economic and social wellbeing of local communities within the AONB. Third, to publish and promote the implementation of a management plan for the AONB.

In contrast to National Parks, The Chilterns – as other AONBs – do not possess their own planning authority. The Board has an advisory role on planning and development matters and seeks to influence the actions of local government by commenting upon planning applications.

The local authorities (two County Councils, three Unitary Authorities and four District and Borough Councils) are expected to respect the area&#x27;s status as a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

===Heritage===
Examples of historical architecture in the Chiltern region are preserved at the Chiltern Open Air Museum near Chalfont St Giles. This open-air folk museum contains reconstructed buildings which might otherwise have been destroyed or demolished as a result of redevelopment or road construction.

==Chiltern Hundreds==

The Chilterns include the Chiltern Hundreds. By established custom, Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, who are prohibited from resigning their seats directly, may apply for the Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds as a device to enable their departure from the House.

==List of hills==
Hills in The Chilterns National Landscape with more than 30 metres of topographic prominence are listed from southwest to northeast.

<doc id="293653" wikidata="Q763540" url="?curid=293653" title="Smurfit-Stone Container">
<text>Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation was a global paperboard and paper-based packaging company based in Creve Coeur, Missouri, and Chicago, Illinois, with approximately 21,000 employees. In 2007, Smurfit-Stone was ranked 13 in PricewaterhouseCoopers&#x27; &quot;Top 100&quot; forest, paper, and packaging companies in the world as ranked by sales revenue. The company was also among the world&#x27;s largest paper recyclers.

Rock-Tenn bought the company in a $3.5 billion deal that closed in May 2011. Rock-Tenn is now known as Smurfit WestRock.

==Financial performance==
==History==

SSCC was formed in November 1998, with the merger of Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (JSC) and Stone Container Corporation (Stone). JSC’s roots go back to 1974, when Dublin, Ireland-based Jefferson Smurfit Group (JSG) acquired partial interest in Time Industries, a Chicago-based paper and packaging company. JSG established a major presence in the United States with the 1981 acquisition of the Alton Box Board Company and the 1982 acquisition of Diamond International’s packaging operations. In 1983, JSG’s U.S. operations reorganized and the majority of these operations became subsidiaries of JSC. JSC went on to establish a leadership position in the U.S. paper and packaging industry with its 1986 acquisition of 50 percent of Container Corporation of America (CCA) from Mobil Corporation.

Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II (MSLEF II) purchased the other half of CCA. JSC restructured as a privately held company in 1989, jointly owned by JSG and MSLEF II. As part of the restructuring, JSC acquired the remainder of CCA. In 1994, JSC recapitalized as a publicly traded company.

Stone Container was founded in 1926 as J.H. Stone and Company. In 1945, it incorporated under the name Stone Container Corporation. In the 1950s, Stone expanded outside of Chicago, buying and building corrugated container plants in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. The company acquired facilities from Continental Group in 1983 and acquired additional facilities from Champion International in 1986 and Southwest Forest Industries in 1987. Stone Container sold its forest products division to management in 1996.

The merger of JSC and Stone in 1998 brought together two leaders of the paper-based packaging industry. In conjunction with the merger closing, JSG purchased 20 million shares of JSC’s stock from MSLEF II and certain other investors. In May 2000, SSCC acquired St. Laurent Paperboard, Inc. In September 2002, the company acquired MeadWestvaco’s Stevenson, Alabama, containerboard mill and related operations. That same month, JSG privatized and distributed its stake in SSCC. Later, neither JSG nor MSLEF II were stockholders of Smurfit-Stone. In March 2003, SSCC exchanged its European assets for JSG’s 50 percent ownership of Smurfit-MBI, a Canadian packaging company, and $189 million cash. SSCC later owned 100 percent of Smurfit-MBI. As a result of this transaction, SSCC focused almost exclusively on the North American market.

In May 2008, Smurfit-Stone opened a high-tech corrugated container-producing facility in New Lenox, Illinois. The newer plant was to employ 145 people and supply companies in the pizza, oil lubricants, detergents and household goods, cooking, and health care industries.

The firm had naming rights to a high-profile building on Chicago&#x27;s skyline, until it was re-named the Crain Communications Building in 2012. Adventures in Babysitting with Elisabeth Shue was filmed there.

==Products==
Smurfit-Stone had two reportable business segments. The containerboard and corrugated containers segment accounted for 75 percent of net sales and included the company’s containerboard mills and corrugated container operations. The consumer packaging segment represented 20 percent of net sales and consists of CRB, folding carton plants, and multiwall and specialty bag operations. It also included packaging equipment, flexible packaging, tube, and label plants. Other operations included nonreportable segments, which accounts for 5 percent of net sales and primarily consists of recycling operations, including collection centers and brokerage sales offices.

On 15 May 2006, the firm reported the definitive sale for $1.04 billion in cash of its Consumer Packaging division to Texas Pacific Group.

==Bankruptcy and corporate reorganization==
In early January 2009, The Wall Street Journal announced that Smurfit-Stone had hired lawyers to plan for a potential bankruptcy filing – which caused an 83% collapse of Smurfit-Stone&#x27;s stock price. On January 27, 2009, Smurfit-Stone filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware.

The company&#x27;s CEO claims Smurfit-Stone was forced to file bankruptcy because of higher operations costs, burdensome debt levels from prior corporate mergers, and weakened demand for packaging caused by a global economic recession. Pending court approval, the company hoped to obtain debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing to continue ongoing business operations, payment of employee wages and benefits, and payment of existing vendor obligations.

==Rock-Tenn buyout==

Rock-Tenn (NYSE: RKT) bought the company in a $3.5 billion deal that closed in May 2011.

<doc id="293667" wikidata="Q12076" url="?curid=293667" title="Mesothelae">
<text>The Mesothelae are a suborder of spiders (order Araneae). , two extant families were accepted by the World Spider Catalog, Liphistiidae and Heptathelidae. Alternatively, the Heptathelidae can be treated as a subfamily of a more broadly circumscribed Liphistiidae. There are also a number of extinct families.

This suborder is thought to form the sister group to all other living spiders, and to retain ancestral characters, such as a segmented abdomen with spinnerets in the middle and two pairs of book lungs. Extant members of the Mesothelae are medium to large spiders with eight eyes grouped on a tubercle. They are found only in China, Japan, and southeast Asia. The oldest known Mesothelae spiders are from the Carboniferous, over 300 million years ago.

==Taxonomy==
Reginald Innes Pocock in 1892 was the first to realize that the exceptional characters of the genus &quot;Liphistius&quot; (the only member of the group then known) meant that it was more different from the remaining spiders than they were among themselves. Accordingly, he proposed dividing spiders into two subgroups, Mesothelae for &quot;Liphistius&quot;, and Opisthothelae for all other spiders. The names refer to the position of the spinning organs, which are in the middle of the abdomen in &quot;Liphistius&quot; and nearer the end in all other spiders. In Greek, μέσος (&quot;mesos&quot;) means &quot;middle&quot;, and θήλα (&quot;thēla&quot;) &quot;teat&quot;.

===Phylogeny and classification===
Pocock divided his Opisthothelae into two groups, which he called Mygalomorphae and Arachnomorphae (now Araneomorphae), implicitly adopting the phylogeny shown below.

Pocock&#x27;s approach was criticized by other arachnologists. Thus in 1923, Alexander Petrunkevitch rejected grouping mygalomorphs and araneomorphs into Opisthothelae, treating Liphistiomorphae (i.e. Mesothelae), Mygalomorphae and Arachnomorphae (Araneomorphae) as three separate groups. Others, such as W. S. Bristowe in 1933, put Liphistiomorphae and Mygalomorphae into one group, called Orthognatha, with Araneomorphae as Labidognatha:

In 1976, Platnick and Gertsch argued for a return to Pocock&#x27;s classification, drawing on morphological evidence. Subsequent phylogenetic studies based on molecular data have vindicated this view. The accepted classification of spiders is now:

Order Araneae (spiders)
:Suborder Mesothelae 
:Suborder Opisthothelae 
::Infraorder Mygalomorphae 
::Infraorder Araneomorphae (syn. Arachnomorphae )

===Extant families===
Initially the Mesothelae consisted of a single family, Liphistiidae. In 1923, the new genus &quot;Heptathela&quot; was described and placed in a separate tribe within Liphistiidae, Heptatheleae. In 1939, Alexander Petrunkevitch raised the tribe to a separate family, Heptathelidae. In 1985, Robert Raven reunited the two families, a view supported by Breitling in 2022. Other authors have maintained two separate families, a position accepted by the World Spider Catalog .

==Description==
Members of Mesothelae have paraxial chelicerae, two pairs of coxal glands on the legs, eight eyes grouped on a nodule, two pairs of book lungs, and no endites on the base of the pedipalp. Most have at least seven or eight spinnerets near the middle of the abdomen. Lateral spinnerets are multi-segmented.

Recent Mesothelae are characterized by the narrow sternum on the ventral side of the cephalothorax (prosoma). Several plesiomorphic characteristics may be useful in recognizing these spiders: there are tergite plates on the dorsal side and the almost median position of the spinnerets on the ventral side of the opisthosoma. Although it has been claimed that they lack venom glands and ducts, which almost all other spiders have, subsequent works have demonstrated that at least some, possibly all, do in fact have both the glands and ducts. All Mesothelae have eight spinnerets in four pairs. Like mygalomorph spiders, they have two pairs of book lungs.

Unlike all other extant mesothelians, heptathelids do not have fishing lines in front of the entrances to the burrows that they construct, making them more difficult to find. They also have a paired receptaculum (unpaired in other liphistiids), and have a conductor in their palpal bulb. These long palps can confusingly look like an extra pair of legs, a mistake also made of some solifugids.

==Distribution==
Liphistiidae spiders are mainly distributed in Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sumatra, and Thailand, with two species native to China. Heptathelidae are found in Vietnam, the eastern provinces of China, and southern Japan, including the Ryukyu Islands.

==Fossils==

A number of families and genera of fossil arthropods have been assigned to the Mesothelae, particularly by Alexander Petrunkevitch. However, Paul A. Selden has shown that most only have &quot;the general appearance of spiders&quot;, with segmented abdomens (opisthosomae), but no definite spinnerets. These families include:
* †Arthrolycosidae 
* †Arthromygalidae 
* †Pyritaraneidae 
* †&quot;Palaeothele&quot; (unplaced in a family)

Between 2015 and 2019 six genera of Mesothele spider in four families were described from Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) aged Burmese Amber in Myanmar. &quot;Cretaceothele&quot; (Cretaceothelidae) &quot;Burmathele&quot; (Burmathelidae), &quot;Parvithele, Pulvillothele&quot; (Parvithelidae) &quot;Intermesothele&quot; and &quot;Eomesothele&quot; (Eomesothelidae)

<text>Sappi Limited, originally incorporated as &quot;South African Pulp and Paper Industries Limited&quot; in 1936, is a South African pulp and paper company with global operations.

== Products and operation ==

South African Pulp and Paper Industries Limited was founded in 1936. The company is now known as Sappi and is headquartered in Johannesburg, It produces and sells commodity paper products, pulp, dissolving pulp, and forest and timber products for Southern Africa and export markets. In 2013, it was the world&#x27;s largest producer of dissolving pulp.

In 2003, Sappi announced that Andre Wagenaar had been appointed as the CEO of Sappi&#x27;s Forest Products Division, with effect from 1 January 2004, when Dr John Job relinquished his responsibilities for the Southern African businesses.

As of 1 July 2014, Steve Binnie became Sappi&#x27;s CEO. His predecessor, Ralph Boettger, resigned for health reasons having been CEO from 2007.

In July 2019, Michael G. Haws was appointed as president and CEO of Sappi North America, succeeding Mark Gardner who retired at the end of September 2019.

== Global acquisitions and closures ==

In 1990, Sappi purchased the paper mills of UK Dickinson Robinson Group – Nash Mills, Keynsham Paper Mill and Fife Paper Mills from the asset-stripper Roland Franklin (Pembridge Investments). These mills were subsequently closed by Sappi as were all other acquisitions (Kymmini Oy, Blackburn Mill and Wolvercote Mill) they had made in the UK.

On 29 September 2008, Sappi purchased two paper mills in Finland, one in Switzerland and one in Germany from the M-real company. In the United States, Sappi closed its Muskegon, Michigan plant in 2009, which was founded in 1899 by the Central Paper Company. In 2011 Sappi announced closure of their Swiss production site. The company&#x27;s existing kraft pulp plant in Cloquet, Minnesota was replaced by a new mill which began producing dissolving pulp in June 2013.

== Price fixing controversy ==

In 1996, Sappi along other 10 main producers of carbonless paper was investigated by the European Commission for illegal price fixing in various countries in the EU. Although found guilty of earning millions by fixing the price of printing paper, Sappi was granted full immunity from the fine due to its cooperation with the EC&#x27;s cartel investigating unit. Other companies implicated were fined a total of $145 million.

<doc id="293670" wikidata="Q5336608" url="?curid=293670" title="Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates">
<text>In general relativity, Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates are a pair of coordinate systems for a Schwarzschild geometry (e.g. a spherically symmetric black hole) which are adapted to radial null geodesics. Null geodesics are the worldlines of photons; radial ones are those that are moving directly towards or away from the central mass. They are named for Arthur Stanley Eddington and David Finkelstein. Although they appear to have inspired the idea, neither ever wrote down these coordinates or the metric in these coordinates. Roger Penrose seems to have been the first to write down the null form but credits it to the above paper by Finkelstein, and, in his Adams Prize essay later that year, to Eddington and Finkelstein. Most influentially, Misner, Thorne and Wheeler, in their book &quot;Gravitation&quot;, refer to the null coordinates by that name.

In these coordinate systems, outward (inward) traveling radial light rays (which each follow a null geodesic) define the surfaces of constant &quot;time&quot;, while the radial coordinate is the usual area coordinate so that the surfaces of rotation symmetry have an area of . One advantage of this coordinate system is that it shows that the apparent singularity at the Schwarzschild radius is only a coordinate singularity and is not a true physical singularity. While this fact was recognized by Finkelstein, it was not recognized (or at least not commented on) by Eddington, whose primary purpose was to compare and contrast the spherically symmetric solutions in Whitehead&#x27;s theory of gravitation and Einstein&#x27;s version of the theory of relativity.

==Schwarzschild metric==

The Schwarzschild coordinates are formula_1, and in these coordinates the Schwarzschild metric is well known:
:formula_2
where
:formula_3
is the standard Riemannian metric of the unit 2-sphere. 

Note the conventions being used here are the metric signature of ( + − − − ) and the natural units where &quot;c&quot; = 1 is the dimensionless speed of light, &quot;G&quot; the gravitational constant, and &quot;M&quot; is the characteristic mass of the Schwarzschild geometry.

==Tortoise coordinate==
Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates are founded upon the tortoise coordinate – a name that comes from one of Zeno of Elea&#x27;s paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between &quot;swift-footed&quot; Achilles and a tortoise.

The tortoise coordinate formula_4 is defined:
:formula_5
so as to satisfy:
:formula_6

The tortoise coordinate formula_4 approaches formula_8 as formula_9 approaches the Schwarzschild radius formula_10.

When some probe (such as a light ray or an observer) approaches a black hole event horizon, its Schwarzschild time coordinate grows infinite. The outgoing null rays in this coordinate system have an infinite change in &quot;t&quot; on travelling out from the horizon. The tortoise coordinate is intended to grow infinite at the appropriate rate such as to cancel out this singular behaviour in coordinate systems constructed from it.

The increase in the time coordinate to infinity as one approaches the event horizon is why information could never be received back from any probe that is sent through such an event horizon. This is despite the fact that the probe itself can nonetheless travel past the horizon. It is also why the space-time metric of the black hole, when expressed in Schwarzschild coordinates, becomes singular at the horizon – and thereby fails to be able to fully chart the trajectory of an infalling probe.

==Metric==
The ingoing Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates are obtained by replacing the coordinate &quot;t&quot; with the new coordinate &quot;formula_11&quot;. In these coordinates, the Schwarzschild metric can be written as 
:formula_12
where again 
formula_13
is the standard Riemannian metric on the unit radius 2-sphere.

Likewise, the outgoing Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates are obtained by replacing &quot;t&quot; with the null coordinate &quot;formula_14&quot;. The metric is then given by
:formula_15

In both these coordinate systems the metric is explicitly non-singular at the Schwarzschild radius (even though one component vanishes at this radius, the determinant of the metric is still non-vanishing and the inverse metric has no terms which diverge there.)

Note that for radial null rays, &quot;v=const&quot; or &quot;formula_16=const&quot; or equivalently &quot;formula_17=const&quot; or &quot;u=const&quot; we have &quot;dv/dr&quot; and &quot;du/dr&quot; approach 0 and ±2 at large &quot;r&quot;, not ±1 as one might expect if one regarded &quot;u&quot; or &quot;v&quot; as &quot;time&quot;. When plotting Eddington–Finkelstein diagrams, surfaces of constant &quot;u&quot; or &quot;v&quot; are usually drawn as cones, with &quot;u&quot; or &quot;v&quot; constant lines drawn as sloping at 45 degree rather than as planes (see for instance Box 31.2 of MTW). Some sources instead take formula_18, corresponding to planar surfaces in such diagrams. In terms of this formula_19 the metric becomes
:formula_20
which is Minkowskian at large &quot;r&quot;. (This was the coordinate time and metric that both Eddington and Finkelstein presented in their papers.)

The Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates are still incomplete and can be extended. For example, the outward traveling timelike geodesics defined by (with &quot;τ&quot; the proper time)
:formula_21
:formula_22
has &quot;v&quot;(&quot;τ&quot;) → −∞ as &quot;τ&quot; → 2&quot;GM&quot;. Ie, this timelike geodesic has a finite proper length into the past where it comes out of the horizon (&quot;r&quot; = 2&quot;GM&quot;) when &quot;v&quot; becomes minus infinity. The regions for finite &quot;v&quot; and &quot;r&quot; &lt; 2&quot;GM&quot; is a different region from finite &quot;u&quot; and &quot;r&quot; &lt; 2&quot;GM&quot;. The horizon &quot;r&quot; = 2&quot;GM&quot; and finite &quot;v&quot; (the black hole horizon) is different from that with &quot;r&quot; = 2&quot;GM&quot; and finite &quot;u &quot;(the white hole horizon) .

The metric in Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates covers all of the extended Schwarzschild spacetime in a single coordinate system. Its chief disadvantage is that in those coordinates the metric depends on both the time and space coordinates. In Eddington–Finkelstein, as in Schwarzschild coordinates, the metric is independent of the &quot;time&quot; (either &quot;t&quot; in Schwarzschild, or &quot;u&quot; or &quot;v&quot; in the various Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates), but none of these cover the complete spacetime.

The Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates have some similarity to the Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates in that both are time independent, and penetrate (are regular across) either the future (black hole) or the past (white hole) horizons. Both are not diagonal (the hypersurfaces of constant &quot;time&quot; are not orthogonal to the hypersurfaces of constant &quot;r&quot;.) The latter have a flat spatial metric, while the former&#x27;s spatial (&quot;time&quot; constant) hypersurfaces are null and have the same metric as that of a null cone in Minkowski space (formula_23 in flat spacetime).

<text>MeadWestvaco Corporation was an American packaging company based in Richmond, Virginia. It had approximately 23,000 employees. In February 2006, it moved its corporate headquarters to Richmond. In March 2008, the company announced a change to start using &quot;MWV&quot; as its brand, but the legal name of the company remained MeadWestvaco.

MeadWestvaco announced in January 2015 that it would form a combined $16 billion company with RockTenn to take on market leaders in the packaging industry in the U.S. The combined company is named WestRock.

==Overview==
MeadWestvaco was a producer of packaging, specialty papers, consumer and office products and specialty chemicals. The company had 153 operating and office locations in 30 countries, and served customers in over 100 countries. The company’s paperboard, package and paper brands included Carrier Kote, Custom Kote, Printkote, Tango, Digipak, Amaray, Dosepak and Vision. MeadWestvaco held leading positions in the markets it served. MeadWestvaco managed over 3 million acres (12,000 km2) of forestlands that met environmental standards and was certified to Sustainable Forestry Initiative standards.

==Financial information==
==History==
MeadWestvaco was formed in January 2002 as the result of a merger between The Mead Corporation of Dayton, Ohio, and Westvaco.

=== 1800s ===
The Mead Corporation was founded as Ells, Claflin &amp; Co in 1846. In 1856, the name was changed to Weston &amp; Mead. In 1861, it became Mead &amp; Weston. In 1881, the company&#x27;s name changed again, this time to The Mead Paper Company. In 1890, the Ingham Mill in Chillicothe was purchased by the Mead Paper Company, making it a two mill operation. In June 1906, the mill in Dayton closed and milling operations shifted to the Ingham Mill.

In 1888, Westvaco&#x27;s predecessor company was founded as Piedmont Pulp &amp; Paper Co.

=== 1900-1950 ===
In March 1920, the Mead Fibre Company was created to take over operations of the Kingsport Pulp Corporation in Kingsport, Tennessee. In 1921, the Mead Sales Company was formed to sell the Mead Paper Company&#x27;s projects. In 1928, the Mead Paperboard Corporation was formed to operate mills in Virginia, South Carolina and Tennessee. In 1930, the Mead Corporation was formed to unite the several Mead companies under one umbrella.

During the 1930s and &#x27;40s, the company acquired several mills and companies, including the Dill and Collins mill in Philadelphia, the Brunswick Pulp and Paper Company in Brunswick, Georgia and the Escanaba Paper Company. It was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1935.

=== 1951-2000 ===
In 1955, Mead acquired the Chillicothe Paper Company and the Jackson Box Company. In 1957, Mead acquired Cleveland Paper, a merchant paper distributor.

In 1966, Mead acquired Westab, a school supply company whose product line included the Big Chief tablet, Spiral Notebook brand and Hytone Notebooks.

In 1968, Mead entered the information technology sector by acquiring Data Corporation for $6 million and renaming it Mead Data Central. Mead was originally interested in an inkjet printing system developed by Data. However, Data had also been working on a full-text information retrieval system for the U.S. Air Force, and by 1967 had adapted this product to the task of indexing and searching legal precedent as part of an experiment with the Ohio State Bar. After a study led by Arthur D. Little indicated that the product had a profitable future, Mead Data Central launched it as the LEXIS legal research system in 1973. In December 1994, Mead sold the LexisNexis system to Reed Elsevier for $1.5 billion.

The U.S. state of Illinois subsequently audited Mead&#x27;s income tax returns and charged Mead an additional $4 million in income tax and penalties for the sale of LexisNexis; Mead paid the tax, but sued for a refund in Illinois state court. On April 15, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with Mead that the Illinois courts had incorrectly applied the Court&#x27;s precedents on whether Illinois could constitutionally apply its income tax to Mead, an out-of-state, Ohio-based corporation. The Court reversed and remanded so that the lower courts could apply the correct test and determine whether Mead and Lexis were a &quot;unitary&quot; business.

In the 1960s and &#x27;70s, Mead acquired several companies, including the Woodward Corp, an iron company, in 1968, Stanley Furniture of Virginia in 1969 and Murray Rubber in 1977. In 1978, Mead and 13 other companies were sued for violating anti-trust laws. The suit alleged that the companies had collaborated to increase the cost of cardboard containers between March 1973 and December 1975. In 1982, Mead settled an antitrust lawsuit for $45 million.

In 1986, Mead acquired Ampad makers of legal pads which it sold in 1992 to Bain Capital.

Mead acquired the Hilroy Companies in 1994 from a consortium of banks that had purchased Olympia and York from the receiver, O&amp;Y&#x27;s subsidiary through Abitibi-Price.

=== 2000 to present ===
In 2005, the Papers business unit—including both Mead and Westvaco paper mills—was sold to the investment firm Cerberus Capital Management for about $2.3 billion. The new company was called NewPage Corporation.

In 2008, MeadWestvaco sold its Charleston, SC kraft paper mill to Kapstone Paper and Packaging. Also in 2008, MeadWestvaco began using the &quot;MWV&quot; brand.

In February 2011, MeadWestvaco sold its Envelope Products Business, including the Columbian Brand Envelope, to Cenveo Corporation&#x27;s Quality Park Envelope Products Group.

In 2012, ACCO Brands acquired Mead.

In January 2015, MeadWestvaco and Rock-Tenn Co agreed to a merger.

==Environmental record==

In 2002, researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have identified MeadWestvaco as the 57th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with roughly 35,000 pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air. Major pollutants indicated by the study include sulfuric acid, chlorine dioxide, chlorine, and methyl iodide.

MeadWestvaco took steps to improve its environmental impact by upholding both mandated and voluntary performance standards. It was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, a system that tracks the financial performance of leading sustainability-driven companies worldwide. MWV met the carbon reduction targets of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), the world&#x27;s first and North America&#x27;s only legally binding rules-based greenhouse gas emissions allowance trading system. It held leadership positions in and actively supports Sustainable Packaging Coalition, Cerflor, CCX, World Business Council for Sustainable Development, Abundant Forests Alliance, Duke University Climate Change Policy Partnership and Sustainable Forestry Initiative.

==MeadWestvaco Foundation==

In 2002, MeadWestvaco established the MeadWestvaco Foundation as a vehicle to appropriately give back to the communities in which its employees live and work. The Foundation works closely with local MWV business unit managers to determine the goals, priorities, and strategies best for each location.

The Foundation’s 2007 contributions totaled roughly $3.7million. Funds were allocated to the following categories: United Way, education, environment, health &amp; human services, culture &amp; art, and civic organizations. MWV employees, families, and friends also contributed over 46,000 volunteer hours to schools, charitable organizations, and public institutions.

<doc id="293676" wikidata="Q1427580" url="?curid=293676" title="Flavr Savr">
<text>Flavr Savr (also known as CGN-89564-2; pronounced &quot;flavor saver&quot;), a genetically modified tomato, was the first commercially grown genetically engineered food to be granted a license for human consumption. It was developed by the Californian company Calgene in the 1980s. The tomato has an improved shelf-life, increased fungal resistance, and a slightly increased viscosity compared to its unmodified counterpart. It was meant to be harvested ripe for increased flavor for long-distance shipping. The Flavr Savr contains two genes added by Calgene; a reversed antisense polygalacturonase gene, which inhibits the production of a rotting enzyme, and a gene responsible for the creation of APH(3&#x27;)II, which confers resistance to certain aminoglycoside antibiotics, including kanamycin and neomycin. On May 18, 1994, the FDA completed its evaluation of the Flavr Savr tomato and the use of APH(3&#x27;)II, concluding that the tomato &quot;is as safe as tomatoes bred by conventional means&quot; and &quot;that the use of aminoglycoside 3&#x27;-phosphotransferase II is safe for use as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, rapeseed oil, and cotton intended for food use.&quot; It was first sold in 1994, and was only available before production ceased in 1997. Calgene made history, but mounting costs prevented the company from becoming profitable, and it was eventually acquired by Monsanto Company.

== Characteristics ==
Tomatoes have a short shelf-life in which they remain firm and ripe. This lifetime may be shorter than the time needed for them to reach market when shipped from winter growing areas to markets in the north, and the softening process can also lead to more of the fruit being damaged during transit. If picked while ripe, tomatoes can spoil before reaching far-away consumers due to their short lifetime. To address this, tomatoes intended for shipping are often picked while they are unripe, or &quot;green&quot;, and then prompted to ripen just before delivery through the use of ethylene gas, which acts as a plant hormone. The downside to this approach is that the tomato does not complete its natural growing process, and the final flavor suffers as a result.

Through genetic engineering, Calgene hoped to slow down the ripening process of the tomato, thus preventing it from softening too early, while still allowing the tomato to retain its natural color and flavor. This would allow it to fully ripen on the vine and still be shipped long distances without it going soft. Calgene scientists used the modified bacterial parasite &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; to transfer genetic material into Flavr Savr plant cells. The bacterium normally &quot;infects&quot; plants with foreign genes as a part of its lifecycle. The harmful, parasitic genetic material was removed from the bacterial T-plasmid and was replaced by the favored genes. 

The Flavr Savr was made more resistant to rotting by the addition of an antisense gene which interferes with the production of the enzyme beta polygalacturonase. The enzyme normally contributes to spoilage by degrading pectin in cell walls and results in the softening of fruit, which makes them more susceptible to being damaged by fungal infections and physical actions.

Flavr Savr turned out to disappoint researchers in that respect, as the antisense version of the PG gene had a positive effect on shelf life, but not on the fruit&#x27;s firmness. The Flavr Savr was too soft to be reliably machine-picked and transported when harvested while ripe, so the tomatoes still had to be harvested like any other unmodified vine-ripe tomato. An improved flavor, later achieved through traditional breeding of Flavr Savr and better-tasting varieties, would contribute to selling Flavr Savr at a premium price at the supermarket.

The Flavr Savr also contained a kanamycin-resistance gene. This gene gave bacterial cells and chloroplasts resistance to multiple antibiotics, including kanamycin. The kanamycin-resistance gene was used during the tomato&#x27;s creation phase to help scientists identify plants with the genes successfully added. Kanamycin is toxic to chloroplasts and is deadly for some plants. When researchers exposed tomato plants to high levels of kanamycin, only plants with the added genes survived.

== Controversy ==
The FDA stated that special labeling for these modified tomatoes was not necessary because they have the essential characteristics of unmodified tomatoes. Specifically, no evidence for health risks was found, and the nutritional content was unchanged. According to the existing policy at the time, genetically modified products were only required to be labeled if a significant alteration was made. Most GMOs were not subjected to mandatory labeling, which allowed for the vast majority of commercially sold, genetically modified foods to remain unlabeled.

Flavr Savr tomatoes were still labeled as genetically altered, though it was not a requirement. The FDA&#x27;s no-label policy was criticized because people believed that consumers deserved the right to know what was in their food. Safety concerns were also cited. Thousands of comments were sent to the FDA asking for a change to the labeling guidelines. However, the FDA still did not implement mandatory labeling of foods derived from biotechnology until January 2022.

Some did not trust the tomato&#x27;s safety. Because some members of the public were misinformed on genetic technology, people feared the Flavr Savr and other genetically modified products to be potentially hazardous to human health or the environment. Some chefs and food distributors boycotted the Flavr Savr and refused to sell the tomatoes in their stores. Jeremy Rifkin, an antibiotechnology activist, said, &quot;It may be benign, but [the Flavr Savr] may turn out to be toxic.&quot; He founded the Pure Food Campaign, which opposed the introduction of genetically modified foods into consumer markets.

== Acquisition by Monsanto ==
Because of high research and production costs and low profits, Calgene was sold to Monsanto in 1997 for more than $200 million. Monsanto acquired all of Calgene&#x27;s products, including the Flavr Savr. The company was more interested in Calgene&#x27;s patents to certain key technologies, and the Flavr Savr has since been shelved and is currently out of production.

The failure of the Flavr Savr has been attributed to Calgene&#x27;s inexperience in the business of growing and shipping tomatoes.

== Tomato paste ==

In the UK, Zeneca produced a tomato paste that used technology similar to the Flavr Savr. Don Grierson was involved in the research to make the genetically modified tomato. Due to the characteristics of the tomato, it was cheaper to produce than conventional tomato paste, resulting in the product being 20% cheaper. Between 1996 and 1999, 1.8 million cans, clearly labelled as genetically engineered, were sold in the major supermarket chains Sainsbury&#x27;s and Safeway UK. At one point, the paste outsold normal tomato paste, but sales fell in the autumn of 1998.

The House of Commons of the United Kingdom published a report in which they stated that the decline in sales during this period was linked to changing consumer perceptions of genetically modified crops. The report identified several possible factors, including product labeling and perception of choice, lobbying campaigns, and media attention. It concluded that the tone of media reports on the subject underwent a &quot;fundamental shift&quot; in response to a high-profile incident in which Dr. Arpad Pusztai, a researcher for Rowett Research Institute, was fired after making a televised claim about detrimental health effects in laboratory rats fed a diet of genetically modified potatoes (see the Pusztai affair). Subsequent peer review and testimony by Dr. Pusztai led the House Science and Technology Select Committee to conclude that his initial claim was &quot;contradicted by his own evidence.&quot; In the intervening period, Sainsbury&#x27;s and Safeway both pledged that none of their house-brand products would contain genetically modified ingredients.

<doc id="293678" wikidata="Q616146" url="?curid=293678" title="Croatian Spring">
<text>The Croatian Spring (), or Maspok, was a political conflict that took place from 1967 to 1971 in the Socialist Republic of Croatia, at the time part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. As one of six republics comprising Yugoslavia at the time, Croatia was ruled by the League of Communists of Croatia (SKH), nominally independent from the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ), led by President Josip Broz Tito. The 1960s in Yugoslavia were marked by a series of reforms aimed at improving the economic situation in the country and increasingly politicised efforts by the leadership of the republics to protect the economic interests of their respective republics. As part of this, political conflict occurred in Croatia when reformers within the SKH, generally aligned with the Croatian cultural society , came into conflict with conservatives.

In the late 1960s, a variety of grievances were aired through , which were adopted in the early 1970s by a reformist faction of the SKH led by Savka Dabčević-Kučar and Miko Tripalo. The complaints initially concerned economic nationalism. The reformists wished to reduce transfers of hard currency to the federal government by companies based in Croatia. They later included political demands for increased autonomy and opposition to real or perceived overrepresentation of the Serbs of Croatia in the security services, politics, and in other fields within Croatia. A particular point of contention was the question of whether the Croatian language was distinct from Serbo-Croatian.

The Croatian Spring increased the popularity of figures from Croatia&#x27;s past, such as the 19th century Croat politician and senior Austrian military officer, Josip Jelačić, and the assassinated leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, Stjepan Radić, as well as an increase in patriotic songs, works of art, and other expressions of Croatian culture. Plans were made for increased representation of Croatia-related materials in the school curriculum, measures to address the overrepresentation of Serbs in key positions in Croatia and to amend the Constitution of Croatia to emphasise the nature of the republic as the national state of Croats. There were also demands for increased powers for the constituent republics at the expense of Yugoslavia&#x27;s federal government. These issues increased tensions between Croats and the Serbs of Croatia, as well as between the reformist and conservative factions of the SKH.

While other republics, the SKJ, and Tito himself were not initially involved in the internal Croatian struggle, the increasing prominence of Croatian nationalism led Tito and the SKJ to intervene. Similar to reformers in other Yugoslav republics, the SKH leadership was compelled to resign. Nevertheless, their reforms were left intact and most demands of the ousted leadership were later adopted, ushering in a form of federalism that contributed to the subsequent breakup of Yugoslavia.

==Background==
===Economic crisis===

In the early 1960s, the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia was a federation according to its constitution (comprising the people&#x27;s republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia), but &quot;de facto&quot; operated as a centralised state. The Yugoslav economy was in recession, prompting economic reforms, which were hastily implemented and proved ineffective. By 1962, the country&#x27;s economic difficulties worsened, prompting debate on the foundations of the economic system. In March 1962, President Josip Broz Tito convened the extended central committee of the country&#x27;s ruling party, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ), to discuss the role of the SKJ and the relationship between the central government and the constituent republics. The meeting exposed a clash between Serbs, openly supported by a Serb deputy prime minister Aleksandar Ranković, and Slovene members of the body, particularly Miha Marinko and Sergej Kraigher, cautiously supported by Slovene deputy prime minister Edvard Kardelj. The Slovene delegation advocated for devolving power and authority to the constituent republics. The Serb delegation sought to preserve the central government&#x27;s monopoly on decision-making and the distribution of tax revenue to less-developed republics. As it was less developed than PR Slovenia and PR Croatia, PR Serbia would have benefited from such an arrangement. In 1963, a new constitution was adopted, granting additional powers to the republics, and the 8th Congress of the SKJ expanded the powers of the SKJ branches the following year.

===Politicisation of reforms===
Further economic reforms were adopted in 1964 and 1965, transferring considerable powers from the federation to the republics and individual companies. Some of the reform measures exacerbated conflict between the banks, insurers, and foreign trade organisations owned by the Yugoslav government versus those owned by the constituent republics, a conflict that became increasingly political and nationalist. Competing alliances were established. Ranković gained the support of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, in addition to Serbia. Slovenia was supported by Croatia, based on the belief of Vladimir Bakarić—the Secretary of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Croatia (SKH)—that decentralisation would benefit others in Yugoslavia. Bakarić persuaded Krste Crvenkovski, the head of the League of Communists of Macedonia (SKM), to support the Slovene–Croatian reformist bloc, which managed to enact substantial legislation curbing federal powers in favour of the republics. The conflict was framed as a contest between Serbia&#x27;s interests against those of Slovenia and Croatia.

In Croatia, positions adopted by Ranković&#x27;s allies in the League of Communists of Serbia (SKS) and the League of Communists of Montenegro (SKCG) were interpreted as , which in turn increased the appeal of Croatian nationalism. By the mid-1960s, the United States consul in Zagreb, Helene Batjer, estimated that about half of SKH members and 80 percent of the population of Croatia held nationalist views.

===Peak of the reformist forces===

By early 1966, it was clear that the reforms had not produced the desired results. The SKJ blamed the Serbian leadership for resistance to the reforms. In early 1966, Kardelj persuaded Tito to remove Ranković from the SKJ Central Committee and dismiss him as vice president of Yugoslavia. Ranković was accused of plotting to seize power, disregarding the decisions of the eighth congress of the SKJ (December 1964), abuse of the State Security Administration directly or through allies, and illegally wire-tapping the SKJ leadership, including Tito himself. Tito saw Ranković&#x27;s removal as an opportunity to implement greater decentralisation. In devolving power to constituent units of the federation, Tito assumed the role of sole arbiter in inter-republican disputes.

In 1967 and 1968, the Yugoslav constitution was amended once again, further reducing federal authority in favour of the constituent republics. The peak of the reformist coalition occurred at the 9th congress of the SKJ in March 1969, during which decentralisation of all aspects of the country was proposed. A World Bank loan for the construction of motorways caused a major rift in the reformist coalition after the federal government decided to shelve plans to develop a highway section in Slovenia and build one highway section in Croatia and one in Macedonia instead. For the first time, a constituent republic (Slovenia) protested a decision of the federal government, but Slovene demands were rejected. The situation became heated, prompting the Slovene authorities to publicly state that they had no plan to secede. In the aftermath of the affair, the Slovenian authorities withdrew their support for the reformist coalition. Regardless, the SKH and the SKM pressured the SKJ to adopt the principle of unanimity in decision-making, obtaining veto power for the republican branches of the SKJ in April 1970.

Student demonstrations erupted in Belgrade in June 1968 against authoritarian aspects of the Yugoslav regime, market reforms, and their impact on Yugoslav society. The students were inspired by the worldwide protests of 1968, and criticism of the reforms leveled by the Marxist humanist Praxis School. They opposed decentralisation and criticised nationalism in Yugoslavia through the &quot;Praxis&quot; journal. In November 1968, Petar Stambolić and other SKS leaders whose political views were a blend of communist dogmatism and Serbian nationalism, were removed on Tito&#x27;s initiative. Tito specifically blamed Stambolić for not stopping the student demonstrations in a timely fashion. The replacements were Marko Nikezić, as the president, and Latinka Perović as the secretary of the SKS, respectively. Nikezić and Perović supported market-based reforms and a policy of non-interference in other republics&#x27; affairs except where officials from those republics denounced Serbian nationalism outside of Serbia.

==National revival==
===Grievances===
By the end of the 1960s, the economic reforms had not resulted in discernible improvement within Croatia. Belgrade-based federal banks still dominated the Yugoslav loan market and foreign trade. Croatia-based banks were pushed out from Dalmatia, a popular tourist region, and hotels there were gradually taken over by large companies based in Belgrade. Croatian media reported that favourable purchase agreements for Serbian companies were the result of political pressure and bribery, and the situation was framed as an ethnic rather than economic conflict.

Furthermore, the situation was worsened by a perception among Croatian nationalists of cultural and demographic threats to Croatia from the following policies: use of school textbooks to suppress Croatian national sentiment, a campaign to standardise the Serbo-Croatian language in a way favouring Serbian dialects, demographic displacement by Serbs, and encouragement of Dalmatian regionalism. Calls for the establishment of autonomous Serbian provinces in Dalmatia and elsewhere in Croatia, seen as a threat to Croatia&#x27;s territorial integrity, added to these concerns. Many people in Croatia believed these to be substantive threats intended to weaken the republic, and rejected alternate explanations of them attributing the changes to economic phenomena or results of modernisation. Early in 1969, a number of grievances were listed in an article by the Croatian Writers&#x27; Association president, Petar Šegedin, in , a magazine published by . In the article, Šegedin accused the Yugoslav government of attempting cultural assimilation of Croatia.

===Language question===
In 1967, the first two volumes of the Dictionary of Serbo-Croatian Literary and Vernacular Language based on the 1954 Novi Sad Agreement were published, sparking controversy about whether Croatian was a separate language. Both volumes excluded common Croatian expressions or treated them as local dialect while Serbian variants were often presented as the standard. The unrelated 1966 Serbo-Croatian dictionary published by further inflamed the situation by omitting the term &quot;Croat&quot; from the vocabulary.

The Declaration on the Name and Status of the Croatian Literary Language was issued by 130 Croatian linguists, including 80 communists, on 17 March 1967. The declaration criticised the 1967 dictionary and called for official recognition of Croatian as a separate language and for a requirement for the government of Croatia to use the Croatian language in official business. This step would have disadvantaged the many Serb bureaucrats in Croatia. The declaration drew &quot;A Proposal for Reflection&quot; in response, drafted by 54 Serbian writers calling for TV Belgrade to use Cyrillic script and to provide education for the Serbs of Croatia in the Serbian language. There were also several denunciations of the declaration on the Name and Status of the Croatian Literary Language from the SKJ within days. The declaration was not universally supported in Croatia. The deputy speaker of the Sabor, , denounced Franjo Tuđman, the head of the Institute for the History of the Workers&#x27; Movement of Croatia, and Većeslav Holjevac, the head of the Croatian Heritage Foundation, for hiring known Croatian nationalists. The declaration marked the beginning of the four-year long period of increased Croatian nationalism commonly referred to as the Croatian Spring.

 withdrew from the Novi Sad Agreement on 22 November 1970 because insisted that Croatian was only a dialect of Serbian. went on to publish a new Croatian dictionary and orthography manual by Stjepan Babić, Božidar Finka, and Milan Moguš, which was condemned by Serbia. The Croatian nationalists reacted by promoting linguistic purism and by revising school textbooks to increase coverage of Croatian history and culture. became the rallying point of the nationalist revival, and its economic secretary Šime Đodan was particularly popular. In 1970, &#x27;s membership grew from about 2,000 to 40,000, increasing its political influence. It also enabled complaints to Yugoslav Railways, backed by the SKH, that Serbian Ekavian spelling ought to be supplemented with Croatian Ijekavian spelling in all official notices and schedules.

While multiple newspapers and magazines supported , the organisation also introduced its own organ, (Croatian Weekly), which enthusiastically promoted Croatian nationalism. Edited by Vlado Gotovac, it quickly surpassed the number of subscribers of all other newspapers including , the newspaper of record in Croatia.

===SKH factions===

Initially, the SKH was internally divided over support for , and its leadership remained mostly silent on the matter. The party was led by a reformist faction consisting of SKH Secretary of the Central Committee Savka Dabčević-Kučar and Miko Tripalo, supported by Pero Pirker, Dragutin Haramija, Ivan Šibl, and others. Dabčević-Kučar, Tripalo and Pirker assumed the top positions in the SKH in 1969 with Bakarić&#x27;s support. The reformists were opposed by a conservative or anti-reformist faction including Žanko and Stipe Šuvar, Dušan Dragosavac, Jure Bilić, and . In search of support, the conservative faction allied with the Praxis School. Dabčević-Kučar and Tripalo, on the other hand, found support in SKH ranks closer to or associated with such as Đodan and Marko Veselica. In late 1969, Žanko also criticised the SKH leadership as well as Bakarić, accusing them of nationalism and anti-socialist attitudes in an article for . He also wrote a series of articles denouncing , Radio Television Zagreb, and literary magazine and Bruno Bušić as a writer contributing to the magazine. Others accused by Žanko of stirring up nationalist views were writers Šegedin, Gotovac, and Tomislav Ladan; literary critics Vlatko Pavletić, Igor Mandić and ; weekly editor Krešimir Džeba and political columnist Neda Krmpotić; editor of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb-published weekly Živko Kustić, historian Trpimir Macan, art historian Grgo Gamulin, as well as economists Đodan, , Marko and Vladimir Veselica. On 19 December, Tito criticised Žanko&#x27;s actions. In January 1970, Dabčević-Kučar accused Žanko of unitarism and of trying to topple the SKH leadership. Žanko was removed from all political functions and the SKH moved closer to &#x27;s positions. Some sources, including Perović, mark Žanko&#x27;s dismissal as the beginning of the Croatian Spring.

Throughout, the SKH&#x27;s central economic demand was that Croatia be permitted to retain more of its foreign currency earnings. To this end, the SKH maintained good relations with counterparts from Slovenia and Macedonia, and also attempted to secure the support of the League of Communists of Kosovo. Due to its rejection of the SKH&#x27;s economic agenda, the SKS was dismissed as &quot;unionist&quot; by the SKH despite Nikezić&#x27;s support for other reforms. The SKH also opposed the under-representation of Croats in the police, security forces, and the military, as well as in political and economic institutions in Croatia as well as across Yugoslavia. The predominance of Serbs in these positions led to widespread calls for their replacement by Croats. At the federal level, Serbs represented about 39 percent of the Yugoslav population, while Croats accounted for about 19 percent. Serbs were over-represented and Croats under-represented in the civil service by a factor of two, accounting for 67 percent and nine percent of civil servants, respectively. Similarly, Serbs made up between 60–70 percent of the officer corps of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA). In Croatia alone, Serbs represented about 15 percent of the population, but accounted for nearly one-quarter of the SKH&#x27;s members and more than one-half of the police force.

===SKH involvement until mid-1971===

In December 1970, the SKH candidate lost the election of student pro-rector of the Zagreb University to an independent, Ivan Zvonimir Čičak. Non-communist candidates took over the remaining student organisations headquartered in Zagreb in April 1971. Dražen Budiša was elected the head of the Zagreb Student Federation, and Ante Paradžik became the head of the Croatian Student Federation.

Within days of the student-body elections, Tito requested that Dabčević-Kučar order the arrests of Šegedin, Marko Veselica, Budiša, Čičak and Đodan, but she declined. This decision made Dabčević-Kučar very popular in Croatia. At a rally of 200,000 people to mark the 26th anniversary of the 1945 liberation of Zagreb on 7 May, observers from the United States reported that her speech was interrupted about 40 times by cheering and applause directed at her rather than the SKH. According to the British ambassador to Yugoslavia Dugald Stewart, Dabčević-Kučar and Tripalo were very skilled at use of public political rallies and their speeches drew crowds typically expected only at football matches.

Another set of amendments to the Yugoslav constitution was adopted further restricting federal powers in June 1971. The only powers retained by the federal government were foreign affairs, foreign trade, defence, common currency, and common tariffs. Inter-republic committees were set up to make decisions by the federal government before ratification. The SKH wanted further decentralisation in 1971 to include banking and foreign trade, and changes that would allow Croatia to retain more foreign currency earnings. Other demands were coming from outside the SKH Central Committee, ranging from establishing a Croatian military to complete independence. Ultimately the Croatian Spring involved a wide variety of elements including anti-centralists, moderate and extreme nationalists, pro-Ustaše, anti-communists, reformists, democrats and democratic socialists, liberals, and libertarians.

The SKS leadership did not criticise the SKH; on the contrary, Nikezić and Perović defended Croatia&#x27;s reformist leadership to Tito in 1971. Serbian and Croatian newspapers traded accusations of mutual hostility, nationalism, and unitarism, leading Tito to admit that the SKJ had lost control of the media. In a meeting with the SKH leaders in July 1971, Tito expressed concern with the political situation and offered Tripalo the post of Prime Minister of Yugoslavia to move him away from the SKH, but Tripalo declined. Later that month, the conservative faction managed to gain sufficient support to expel Đodan and Marko Veselica from the SKH as &quot;nationalist ringleaders&quot;.

On 2 August, the SKH announced an Action Programme, criticising nationalism which was referred to in the programme as &quot;national movement&quot;, and denouncing unnamed individuals associated with for conspiring against the SKH and the SKJ. The SKH leaders determined that the Action Programme would be formally adopted or rejected by its next plenary session in November. The SKH arranged another meeting with Tito on 14 September, insisting he had been misinformed about the situation. After the meeting, Tito said he was convinced that the stories about chauvinism reigning in Croatia were absurd. He also implied that he favoured the SKH&#x27;s proposal to reform Yugoslavia&#x27;s foreign currency policy. After the meeting, Tripalo suggested that the Action Programme would no longer be considered.

===Looking for role models from the past===

The Croatian Spring spurred increased interest in Croatian historical figures. A commemorative plaque to Stjepan Radić, the founder of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and a champion of the Croatian cause in pre-war Yugoslavia, was put up in Zagreb, followed by a monument to him in the town of Metković. The city of Šibenik cancelled a plan to erect a monument to the victims of fascism, instead erecting a statue of the medieval Croatian king Peter Krešimir IV. A marching band and a living history troop named after the 18th-century Trenck&#x27;s Pandurs were re-established in Požega in 1969. There were also unsuccessful calls to restore a monument to the 19th-century Ban of Croatia Josip Jelačić, which had been removed from Zagreb&#x27;s central square by the SKH in 1947.

Traditional Croatian patriotic songs—some of them banned—experienced a resurgence in popularity. The most popular and controversial singer of such songs at the time was Vice Vukov. returned to formal use as a patriotic song when a plaque was placed in the Zagreb Cathedral commemorating the noblemen involved in the 17th-century Magnate conspiracy. The opera , retelling the 16th-century Siege of Szigetvár, was regularly sold out whenever it played at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. Paintings by Oton Iveković (1869–1939) depicting events from Croatian history became very popular. Croatia&#x27;s historical chequy coat of arms became a famous symbol sewn by youths on jackets and berets or applied on stickers to car windshields. In 1969, it was incorporated into the football club crest Dinamo Zagreb. While the Yugoslav flag was still flown, it was always paired with the Croatian one. The latter was also used on its own, and in overall use in Croatia, it outnumbered the Yugoslav flag by ten to one.

The SKH pointed out the significance of the Catholic Church in Croatian culture and political identity. Dabčević-Kučar later said that the move was motivated by her wish to counterbalance the Serbian Orthodox Church as a &quot;source of Serbian chauvinism&quot;. While the Catholic Church did not play an important role in the Croatian Spring, it contributed to the strengthening of national identity by introducing the Cult of Mary as a Croatian national symbol around the same time. This contribution was reinforced by the canonisation of the 14th-century Croatian Franciscan friar and missionary Nicholas Tavelic in 1970.

The SKH maintained that its current policy was rooted in the Partisan legacy, arguing that the Yugoslav federation was not set up as envisaged by the World War II-era State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH); in particular, ZAVNOH&#x27;s solution to the Croatian question was not implemented. The SKH said that national sentiments were a legitimate expression of interests which communists must defend and that Yugoslavia must be organised as a community of national sovereign republics. published an article by Tuđman praising ZAVNOH. Its cover page carried a photo of the wartime secretary of the Communist Party of Croatia, Andrija Hebrang, whom the SKJ had considered a Soviet spy and a traitor since the 1948 Tito–Stalin split. The article also coincided with a request, ignored by the SKH, to posthumously rehabilitate Hebrang. The initiative was launched as a form of &quot;moral rehabilitation&quot; by anti-communist émigrés including former high-ranking KPJ official Ante Ciliga.
===Demands for autonomy and a new constitution===
At the time of the Croatian Spring, civic relations between Croats and Serbs in Croatia were increasingly framed by diverging narratives of World War I and especially World War II. While Croats focused on the role of the Royal Serbian Army in the creation of the Serb-dominated Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and killings of collaborationist Ustaše troops and their sympathisers in the 1945 Yugoslav pursuit of Nazi collaborators, Serbs negatively evaluated the Croatian participation in Austria-Hungary&#x27;s Serbian campaign during World War I, and especially the genocide of Serbs committed by the Ustaše in the Axis puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). In a series of articles in , Tuđman expressed the view of the majority of the SKH as well as : that Croats had made a significant contribution to the Partisan struggle and were not collectively to blame for Ustaše atrocities.

Among Croatian Serbs, Serbian nationalism flared in response to the Croatian national resurgence. By 1969, the cultural society came to the forefront of Croatian Serb nationalist discourse. A plan put forward by SKH reformists to revise elementary and middle school literature and history curricula so 75 per cent of the coverage would be on Croatian topics drew complaints from , which argued that the plan was a threat to Serb cultural rights. also objected to the SKH&#x27;s attempts to reinterpret the wartime Partisan struggle as a liberation of Croatian nationality within the Yugoslav framework. By 1971, demanded that the Serbian language and Cyrillic script be officially used in Croatia alongside the Croatian language and Latin script, as well as legislative safeguards guaranteeing the national equality of Serbs. rejected the federal model advocated by the ZAVNOH and the SKH, arguing that nationalism was no longer needed in Yugoslavia. Furthermore, denounced the work of and asserted that the Serbs of Croatia would preserve their national identity by relying on Serbia&#x27;s help regardless of the borders of the republics.

Finally, &#x27;s Rade Bulat demanded the establishment of an autonomous province for the Croatian Serbs, and there were calls to grant autonomy for Dalmatia as well. The SKH Central Committee declared that no region of Croatia could make any legitimate claim to autonomy of any kind and labelled calls for regional Dalmatian autonomy as treason to the Croatian nation. Such responses aligned with the SKH&#x27;s objective of national homogenisation. To that end, the SKH blocked the option of declaring one&#x27;s ethnic identity as regional in the 1971 census. The campaign led by to emphasise the distinction between Croatian and Serbian was reflected in the prevailing speech of Croatian Serbs, which changed from predominantly Ijekavian, or an Ekavian-Ijekavian blend, to predominantly Ekavian.

The Serbian philosopher Mihailo Đurić argued that Croatia&#x27;s constitution should be amended to describe the republic as the national state of Croats and Serbs. This remark sparked another series of public debates in March 1971 in the context of the constitutional reform of Yugoslavia. The SKJ responded by bringing charges against Đurić and imprisoning him. proposed an amendment to the constitution, further emphasising the national character of Croatia. The SKH dismissed the proposal and drafted its own wording, arguing it was a compromise. Ultimately passed, the SKH&#x27;s amendment mentioned the Croatian Serbs specifically but defined Croatia as a &quot;national state&quot; of the Croats, avoiding use of the exact same phrase for the Croatian Serbs. The meaning of this difference in formulations was not explained in the text of the constitution. By mid-September 1971, ethnic tensions had worsened to the point that in northern Dalmatia, some Serb and Croat villagers took up arms in fear of each other.

===Outside Croatia===

In February 1971, the Croatian nationalist émigré magazine , printed by Branimir Jelić in West Berlin, published a story attributed to its Moscow correspondent claiming that the Warsaw Pact would help Croatia achieve its independence, granting it a status comparable to that enjoyed by Finland at the time. The article also stated that the SKH was collaborating with Ustaše émigrés. The Yugoslav Military Mission in Berlin reported the story to the military intelligence service along with the names of alleged Ustaše émigré operatives in Croatia. The report was initially believed, leading the Yugoslav authorities to become concerned that the Soviet Union might be instigating and aiding the SKH and the Ustaše émigrés. A federal investigation concluded on 7 April that the story was false, and the authorities decided to bury the affair. Immediately, the SKH announced that foreign and domestic enemies of the SKH stood behind the allegations. The same day, Vladimir Rolović, the Yugoslav ambassador to Sweden, was mortally wounded in an unrelated attack by Ustaše émigrés, further escalating tensions. According to Dabčević-Kučar, the SKH leadership treated the enthusiasm of the émigrés with suspicion, believing it to be linked with the Yugoslav State Security Administration, and also because their activity weakened the SKH&#x27;s position.

Even though the leadership of Bosnia and Herzegovina was cautious in its response to the SKH&#x27;s January 1970 shift towards &#x27;s positions, relations became much tenser, primarily reflected through texts published by journals and , the newspaper of record in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The leadership of Bosnia and Herzegovina initially distinguished between the positions of the SKH and those held by , but this distinction eroded over time. In September, expanded its work to Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Serbian autonomous province of Vojvodina, claiming Croats were underrepresented in government institutions there due to policies implemented during Ranković&#x27;s tenure. By November 1971, Croatian nationalists advocated annexing a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia to rectify the situation. In response, Serbian nationalists claimed other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina for Serbia. Officials from Bosnia and Herzegovina responded by prohibiting the establishment of branches within the republic.

===Foreign policy considerations===

During a meeting of the SKJ leadership at the Brijuni Islands on 28–30 April 1971, Tito received a telephone call from Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. According to Tito, Brezhnev offered help to resolve the political crisis in Yugoslavia, and Tito declined. The offer was likened by the SKH and by Tito to Brezhnev&#x27;s call to the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Alexander Dubček in 1968 ahead of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia—as being a threat of imminent Warsaw Pact invasion. Some members of the SKH Central Committee suggested that Tito invented it to strengthen his position, but the First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union Dmitry Polyansky confirmed the conversation took place.

Aiming to improve the United States&#x27; position in the Mediterranean area following the Black September crisis in Jordan, the United States President Richard Nixon toured several countries in the region. Nixon&#x27;s state visit to Yugoslavia lasted from 30 September until 2 October 1970 and included a trip to Zagreb, where Nixon sparked controversy in a toast at the Banski dvori, the seat of the Croatian government. His toast ended with the words &quot;Long live Croatia! Long live Yugoslavia!&quot;, which were interpreted variously as a show of support for the independence of Croatia, or alternatively as just a common courtesy. The Yugoslav ambassador to the United States interpreted the episode as strategic positioning for a breakup of Yugoslavia.

Brezhnev visited Yugoslavia from 22 to 25 September 1971 amid continuing tension between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union following the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia. Brezhnev offered a friendship agreement, but Tito declined to sign it to avoid appearing to move closer to the Eastern Bloc. Yugoslav officials notified Nixon through Secretary of State William P. Rogers that the meeting with Brezhnev did not go well. An official visit of Tito to the United States was arranged to reassure Tito of the United States&#x27; political, economic, and military support for Yugoslavia. Nixon and Tito met on 30 October in Washington, D.C.

==Suppression and purges==
===November plenum and student protest===

At the 5 November plenary session of the SKH, Dabčević-Kučar said that the national movement was evidence of the unity of the nation and the SKH, which she said should not be sacrificed to achieve revolutionary purity. After she rejected several of Bakarić&#x27;s proposals to modify the SKH&#x27;s policies, the conservative faction—most vocally Bilić and Dragosavac—demanded the enforcement of the August Action Programme. The issue was not resolved by the plenum but, in the aftermath of the session, Bakarić decided to support Bilić and Dragosavac and to ask Tito to intervene. On 12–15 November, Tito visited Bugojno in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he was hosted by the republic&#x27;s leadership (Branko Mikulić, Hamdija Pozderac, and Dragutin Kosovac). On 13 November, they were joined by the Yugoslav prime minister, Džemal Bijedić, who criticised the SKH&#x27;s demands for changing the distribution of foreign currency earnings. Dragosavac met with Tito on 14 and 15 November to discuss the Croatian Spring. On 15 November, Tito was joined by the heads of the JNA to view recordings of political rallies in Croatia where nationalists and SKH members spoke and where anti-Tito shouts could be heard.

The extended SKH Central Committee secretly met from 17 to 23 November, but the two opposing factions could not agree. On 22 November, about 3,000 Zagreb University students voted to begin a strike the next morning. Initially, they protested federal regulations on hard currency, banking and commerce. At Paradžik&#x27;s urging, a series of proposed constitutional amendments was added to the demands: defining Croatia as a sovereign and national state of Croats, making Croatian the official language, guaranteeing that residents of Croatia would complete their compulsory military service in Croatia, and formally establishing Zagreb as Croatia&#x27;s capital and as the anthem of Croatia. The protesters singled out Bakarić for sabotaging Tripalo&#x27;s currency reform. The Croatian Student Federation expanded the strike over Croatia. Within days, 30,000 students were on strike demanding the expulsion of Bilić, Dragosavac, Baltić, Ema Derossi-Bjelajac and Čedo Grbić from the SKH as unitarists. On 25 November, Tripalo met with the students, urging them to stop the strike, and Dabčević-Kučar made the same request four days later.

===Karađorđevo meeting and the purges===
Tito contacted the United States to inform them of his plan to remove the reformist leadership of Croatia, and the United States did not object. Tito considered deploying the JNA but opted for a political campaign instead. On 1 December, Tito convened a joint meeting of the SKJ and the SKH leaders at the Karađorđevo hunting ground in Vojvodina. SKH conservatives first criticised the SKH leadership, asking for stern action against nationalism. SKJ presidium members from other republics and provinces then gave speeches supporting the conservative stance, and the SKH leadership was told to control the situation in Croatia. Tito particularly criticised , accusing it of being a political party and attempting to establish a fascist state similar to the NDH. The next day, after the Karađorđevo meeting, Tito&#x27;s speech was broadcast to all of Yugoslavia, warning of the threat of counter-revolution.

After the broadcast, the student strike was called off and the SKH leadership announced their agreement with Tito. On 6 December, Bakarić criticised the SKH leadership for not taking any practical steps to comply with Tito&#x27;s speech of two days earlier, especially for not taking action against . Bakarić accused Tripalo of attempting to split the SKH by exaggerating the popular support for the reformists. Two days later, the SKJ leadership met again and concluded that the SKH was not implementing the decisions adopted in Karađorđevo. Student strike leaders were arrested on 11 December, and Dabčević-Kučar and Pirker were forced to resign by Tito the next day. At that point, Tripalo, Marko Koprtla and Janko Bobetko immediately also resigned. In the following days, more resignations were tendered, including the head of the government, Haramija. Milka Planinc became the head of the SKH. Five hundred students protested in Zagreb against the resignations and were suppressed by riot police.

Subsequently, tens of thousands were expelled from the SKH, including 741 high-ranking officials such as Dabčević-Kučar, Tripalo, and Pirker. Another 280 SKH members were compelled to resign their posts and 131 were demoted. SKH conservatives demanded a major show trial with Tuđman as the main defendant, but Tito blocked this proposal. Instead, Tuđman was convicted of trying to overthrow the &quot;democratic self-managing socialism&quot;. Overall, 200–300 people were convicted of political crimes, but thousands more were imprisoned without formal charges for two to three months. and were banned, including the former&#x27;s fourteen publications. Purges targeting media professionals, writers, filmmakers, and university staff continued until late 1972. Even though the purges took place only in the period after the 1 December 1971 Karađorđevo meeting, this date is usually thought of as the end of the Croatian Spring in commemorations of the events. Authorities seized and destroyed 40,000 copies of the Moguš, Finka &amp; Babić orthography manual as chauvinist. The remaining 600 copies were bound without any foreword or index and marked &quot;for internal use only&quot;. This version was reprinted by London-based Croatian émigré magazine (&quot;New Croatia&quot;) in 1972 and 1984. The book was published again in Croatia in 1990.

==Aftermath==
===Maintenance of reforms===
Under the new SKH leadership, Ivo Perišin replaced Haramija as the President of its Executive Council in late December 1971. In February 1972, the Croatian Parliament passed a series of 36 amendments to the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, one of which introduced as the republic&#x27;s anthem.

After the downfall of the reformist SKH leadership, anti-communist émigrés wrote about the Croatian Spring as a movement presaging democratisation and praised Dabčević-Kučar and Tripalo as people of &quot;unusual political virtues&quot;. Some émigrés believed that the political situation in Yugoslavia, especially among Croats, was conducive to an uprising. Consequently, nineteen members of the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood terrorist organisation launched an armed incursion into Yugoslavia in mid-1972, hoping to incite a rebellion that would lead to the re-establishment of the NDH. After a month of deadly skirmishes with the authorities, the incursion ended in failure.

Pirker died in August 1972, and his funeral drew 100,000 supporters. The size of the crowd attending the funeral confirmed continued broad support for Dabčević-Kučar and Tripalo, irrespective of their recent purge.

To reduce the popular support for the Croatian nationalists, Tito granted many of the demands of the ousted SKH leaders. For example, export companies were allowed to retain 20 per cent of foreign exchange earnings instead of 7–12 percent while tourism companies increased their retention of foreign currency earnings from 12 per cent to 45 per cent. Devaluation of the Yugoslav dinar by 18.7 per cent, increased the value of the retained foreign currency income on the domestic market.

The new SKH leadership was unwilling to undo the changes implemented by their predecessors and subsequently lost support from the Croatian Serbs. Some Serbs called for the constitution of Croatia to be amended to redefine Croatia as a national state of both Croats and Serbs and create a Serb committee in the Sabor. Those ideas were defeated by Grbić, who held the position of deputy speaker of the Croatian Parliament; as a result, Serbian nationalists denounced Grbić as a traitor to their cause.

The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution preserved the 1971 reforms almost entirely, expanded the economic powers of the constituent republics, and granted reformist demands related to banking, commerce, and foreign currency.

===Legacy in the final decades of Yugoslavia===
In the aftermath of the 1971 purge, the authorities began to pejoratively refer to the events that had transpired as the , a blend word of meaning &quot;mass movement&quot;, as a reference to the politicisation of the masses to ensure the involvement of actors beyond the SKH in Croatia&#x27;s politics. The term &quot;Croatian Spring&quot; was coined retroactively, after the 1971 purges, by those holding a more favourable view of the events. The latter term was not permitted to be publicly used in Yugoslavia until 1989.

The end of the Croatian Spring ushered in a period known as the Croatian Silence (), which lasted until the late 1980s, during which the public kept its distance from the unpopular imposed authorities. Discussion about the position of the Croatian Serbs was avoided by the new Croatian leadership, and Grbić and others became concerned that the question would be left to the Serbian Orthodox Church and nationalists from Serbia to pose solutions without any counterargument.

The Croatian Spring was a significant event for all of Yugoslavia. Reformist factions in the SKS, SKM and the League of Communists of Slovenia were also suppressed by the end of 1972, replaced by mediocre and obedient politicians. During this period, pressure for the complete breakup of Yugoslavia intensified, religious leaders gained influence, and the Partisan legacy that legitimised the state was weakened. The purges of the 1970s in Croatia and elsewhere in Yugoslavia drove many reformist communists and supporters of social democracy away from politics in the country&#x27;s final decades.

From 1989, several people previously involved with the SKH or during the Croatian Spring returned to Croatian politics. Budiša and Gotovac had leading roles in the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), which was formed before the 1990 Croatian parliamentary election. Čičak was prominent in the HSS. In January 1989, Marko and Vladimir Veselica, Tuđman, Šošić, and Ladan launched an initiative to found the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). Dissatisfied with Tuđman&#x27;s election to lead the HDZ, the Veselica brothers left, and formed the Croatian Democratic Party (HDS) in November. The HDZ gained Stjepan Mesić, another SKH official ousted after the Croatian Spring. Dabčević-Kučar, Tripalo, and Haramija formed the Coalition of People&#x27;s Accord coalition as independents, supported by several parties, including the HSLS and HDS. The HDZ won the elections, Tuđman became the President of the Presidency (later President) and Mesić became the President of the Executive Council (later referred to as Prime Minister).

<doc id="293680" wikidata="Q6615552" url="?curid=293680" title="List of dams and reservoirs in New Zealand">
<text>Many of the largest dams and reservoirs in New Zealand have been developed principally to produce hydroelectricity. Other uses include irrigation and municipal water supply.
==Hydro-electric dams==
The main river systems comprising a series of dams and powerhouses are situated on the following rivers:
:The Waikato River
:The Waitaki River
:The Clutha River

Other schemes are standalone developments associated with specific sites.

===Tongariro Power Scheme===
The Tongariro Power Scheme (1,400 GWh) diverts water from the south side of Mount Ruapehu and the west and north sides of Tongariro into Lake Taupō, and thus eventually into the Waikato River.
*Rangipo (cavern) (120 MW)
*Tokaanu (240 MW)
*Moawhango Dam

===The Waikato===
The hydro stations, starting from Lake Taupō, are (capacity in MW and nominal annual energy output in GWh):
*Aratiatia (84 MW) (331 GWh)
*Ohakuri (112 MW) (400 GWh)
*Atiamuri (84 MW) (305 GWh)
*Whakamaru (100 MW) (486 GWh)
*Maraetai (360 MW) (855 GWh)
*Waipapa (51 MW) (330 GWh)
*Arapuni (171 MW) (805 GWh)
*Karapiro (90 MW) (490 GWh)

===The Waitaki===
The river was developed in multiple stages. The Waitaki Dam was built first, without earthmoving machinery, followed by the development of the Aviemore Dam on Lake Aviemore and Benmore Dam on Lake Benmore. Lake Pukaki was initially dammed at this stage to provide storage and flow control. A small station was also installed on Lake Tekapo, but although it has a small dam to raise the pre-existing lake, water was taken through a tunnel to a powerstation below the level of the lake.

In the 1960s, work was started on the Upper Waitaki project. This project consisted of taking the discharge from the original Tekapo (A) station through a power canal, the Tekapo Canal, to Tekapo B station at the edge of Lake Pukaki. The dam at Pukaki was increased in height. Water from Pukaki is then transferred into the Pukaki Canal which meets the Ōhau Canal from Lake Ōhau into Ōhau A station and Lake Ruataniwha. The Ōhau Canal continues beyond Lake Ruataniwha to Ōhau B midway along, before emptying through Ōhau C into Lake Benmore.
The stations are (capacity) (annual output) (commissioned)
*Tekapo A (25 MW) (160 GWh) 1955
*Tekapo B (160 MW) (800 GWh) 1977
*Ōhau A (264 MW) (1150 GWh) 1980
*Ōhau B (212 MW) (970 GWh) 1984/1985
*Ōhau C (212 MW) (970 GWh) 1984/1985

The original Waitaki power stations discharge water back into the Waitaki River which then forms a storage lake for the next station in the chain.
The three power stations are:
*Benmore (540 MW) (2,200 GWh) 1965
*Aviemore (220 MW) (940 GWh) 1968
*Waitaki (105 MW) (500 GWh) 1935

Project Aqua was a proposed scheme of six dams on a man made canal running from the Waitaki Dam to the sea. It was cancelled by Meridian Energy on 29 March 2004.

===Clutha River===
*Clyde Dam (445 MW)
*Roxburgh Dam (320 MW)

===Standalone hydroelectric schemes===
*Manapouri (850 MW) (4,800 GWh)
:Manapouri does not rely on a high dam to provide water – it takes advantage of the natural 178-metre height difference between Lake Manapouri and the sea at Deep Cove in Doubtful Sound, in Fiordland. The power house is in a cavern, while two tailrace tunnels take the water from the power house to Deep Cove and the sea. The Manapouri Control Structure (Mararoa dam) downstream from the original outlet of Lake Manapouri controls the lake level, and feeds water from the Mararoa river back up the river into the Lake.

<text>Prop comedy is a comedy genre in which performers use humorous objects, or conventional objects in humorous ways. The stages and films term &quot;prop&quot;, an abbreviation of &quot;property&quot;, refers to any object an actor handles in the course of a performance. Though some form of prop comedy has likely existed as long as there have been comedians, the genre reached its zenith in the vaudeville era. The vaudeville team Olsen and Johnson used prop comedy extensively in their long running Broadway revue &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot;.

A prop comic is a comedian who uses prop comedy. Prop comics are sometimes looked down upon by other comedians, and the term is sometimes used derisively. However, some, such as Tommy Cooper, rose to critical acclaim as their props revolved around a gimmick (such as Cooper&#x27;s magic) and the comedian&#x27;s character around that gimmick.

==Types of props==
Props are any items that the comedian or comic uses in an absurd way. These can be hand props, such as a book or slapstick, costume props (such as tearaway pants), and set props (such as a breakaway chair).
Another example is the rubber chicken.
==Other occurrences==
The TV comedy game show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; has a round called &quot;Props&quot; in which two teams of comedians are each given a prop each and must improvise with them to humorous effect.

<text>GNUnet is a software framework for decentralized, peer-to-peer networking and an official GNU package. The framework offers link encryption, peer discovery, resource allocation, communication over many transports (such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, WLAN and Bluetooth) and various basic peer-to-peer algorithms for routing, multicast and network size estimation.

GNUnet&#x27;s basic network topology is that of a mesh network. GNUnet includes a distributed hash table (DHT) which is a randomized variant of Kademlia that can still efficiently route in small-world networks. GNUnet offers a &quot;F2F topology&quot; option for restricting connections to only the users&#x27; trusted friends. The users&#x27; friends&#x27; own friends (and so on) can then indirectly exchange files with the users&#x27; computer, never using its IP address directly.

GNUnet uses Uniform resource identifiers (not approved by IANA, although an application has been made). GNUnet URIs consist of two major parts: the module and the module specific identifier. A GNUnet URI is of form codice_1 where &quot;module&quot; is the module name and &quot;identifier&quot; is a module specific string.

The primary codebase is written in C, but there are bindings in other languages to produce an API for developing extensions in those languages. GNUnet is part of the GNU Project. It has gained interest in the hacker community after the PRISM revelations.

GNUnet consists of several subsystems, of which essential ones are Transport and Core subsystems. Transport subsystem provides insecure link-layer communications, while Core provides peer discovery and encryption. On top of the core subsystem various applications are built.

GNUnet includes various P2P applications in the main distribution of the framework, including filesharing, chat and VPN; additionally, a few external projects (such as secushare) are also extending the GNUnet infrastructure.

GNUnet is unrelated to the older Gnutella P2P protocol. Gnutella is not an official GNU project, while GNUnet is.

== Transport ==

Originally, GNUnet used UDP for underlying transport. Now GNUnet transport subsystem provides multiple options, such as TCP and SMTP.

The communication port, officially registered at IANA, is 2086 (tcp + udp).

== Trust system ==

GNUnet provides trust system based on an excess-based economic model. The idea of employing an economic system is taken from the MojoNation network.

GNUnet network has no trusted entities so it is impossible to maintain a global &quot;reputation&quot;. Instead, each peer maintains its own &quot;trust&quot; for each of its local links.

When resources, such as bandwidth and CPU time, are in excess, the peer provides them to all requesting neighbors without reducing trust or otherwise charging them. When a node is under stress it drops requests from its neighbor nodes having lower internal trust value. However, when the peer has less resources than enough to fulfill everyone&#x27;s requests, it denies requests of those neighbors that it trusts less and charges others by reducing their trust.

== File sharing ==
The primary application at this point is anonymous, censorship-resistant file-sharing, allowing users to anonymously publish or retrieve information of all kinds. The GNUnet protocol which provides anonymity is called GAP (GNUnet anonymity protocol). GNUnet FS can additionally make use of GNU libextractor to automatically annotate shared files with metadata.

=== File encoding ===
Files shared with GNUnet are ECRS (An Encoding for Censorship-Resistant Sharing) coded.

All content is represented as GBlocks. Each GBlock contains 1024 bytes. There are several types of GBlocks, each of them serves a particular purpose. Any GBlock formula_1 is uniquely identified by its RIPEMD-160 hash formula_2.

DBlocks store actual file contents and nothing else. File is split at 1024 byte boundaries and resulting chunks are stored in DBlocks. DBlocks are linked together into Merkle tree by means of IBlocks that store DBlock identifiers.

Blocks are encrypted with a symmetric key derived from formula_2 when they are stored in the network.

=== Queries and replies ===
GNUnet Anonymity Protocol consists of queries and replies. Depending on load of the forwarding node, messages are forwarded to zero or more nodes.

Queries are used to search for content and request data blocks.

Query contains resource identifier, reply address, priority and TTL (Time-to-Live).

Resource identifier of datum formula_4 is a triple-hash formula_5. Peer that replies to query provides formula_6to prove that it indeed has the requested resource without providing formula_7 to intermediate nodes, so intermediate nodes can&#x27;t decrypt formula_4.

Reply address is the major difference compared to Freenet protocol. While in Freenet reply always propagates back using the same path as the query, in GNUnet the path may be shorter. Peer receiving a query may drop it, &quot;forward&quot; it without rewriting reply address or &quot;indirect&quot; it by replacing reply address with its own address. By indirecting queries peer provides cover traffic for its own queries, while by forwarding them peer avoids being a link in reply propagation and preserves its bandwidth. This feature allows the user to trade anonymity for efficiency. User can specify an anonymity level for each publish, search and download operation. An anonymity level of &quot;zero&quot; can be used to select non-anonymous file-sharing. GNUnet&#x27;s DHT infrastructure is only used if non-anonymous file-sharing is specified. The anonymity level determines how much cover traffic a peer must have to hide the user&#x27;s own actions.

Priority specifies how much of its trust user wants to spend in case of a resource shortage.

TTL is used to prevent queries from staying in the network for too long.

=== File sharing URIs ===
The &quot;fs&quot; module &quot;identifier&quot; consists of either &quot;chk&quot;, &quot;sks&quot;, &quot;ksk&quot; or &quot;loc&quot; followed by a slash and a category specific value. Most URIs contain hashes, which are encoded in base32hex.

* &quot;chk&quot; identifies files, typically: codice_2
: File hash is the hash of the plaintext file, which allows decrypting it once it is downloaded. Query hash is the hash of topmost GBlock which allows downloading the whole tree of GBlocks that contain encrypted file. File size is required to determine the shape of the tree.
* &quot;sks&quot; identifies files within namespaces, typically: codice_3
* &quot;ksk&quot; identifies search queries, typically: codice_4
* &quot;loc&quot; identifies a datum on a specific machine, typically: codice_5

==== Examples ====
A type of GNUnet filesharing URI pointing to a specific copy of GNU GPL license text:
codice_6

Another type of GNUnet filesharing URI, pointing to the search results of a search with keyword &quot;gpl&quot;:
codice_7

== GNU Name System ==
GNUnet includes an implementation of the GNU Name System (GNS), a decentralized and censorship-resistant replacement for DNS. In GNS, each user manages their own zones and can delegate subdomains to zones managed by other users. Lookups of records defined by other users are performed using GNUnet&#x27;s DHT. GNS has been standardized in . The GANA registry manages the &quot;.alt&quot; top-level domain in GNS.

== Protocol translation ==

GNUnet can tunnel IP traffic over the peer-to-peer network. If necessary, GNUnet can perform IPv4-IPv6 protocol translation in the process. GNUnet provides a DNS Application-level gateway to proxy DNS requests and map addresses to the desired address family as necessary. This way, GNUnet offers a possible technology to facilitate IPv6 transition. Furthermore, in combination with GNS, GNUnet&#x27;s protocol translation system can be used to access hidden services — IP-based services that run locally at some peer in the network and which can only be accessed by resolving a GNS name.

== Social API ==
Gabor X Toth published in early September 2013 a thesis to present the design of a social messaging service for the GNUnet peer-to-peer framework that offers scalability, extensibility, and end-to-end encrypted communication. The scalability property is achieved through multicast message delivery, while extensibility is made possible by using PSYC (Protocol for SYnchronous Conferencing), which provides an extensible RPC (Remote Procedure Call) syntax that can evolve over time without having to upgrade the software on all nodes in the network. Another key feature provided by the PSYC layer are stateful multicast channels, which are used to store e.g. user profiles. End-to-end encrypted communication is provided by the mesh service of GNUnet, upon which the multicast channels are built. Pseudonymous users and social places in the system have cryptographical identities — identified by their public key — these are mapped to human memorable names using GNS (GNU Name System), where each pseudonym has a zone pointing to its places.

That is the required building block for turning the GNUnet framework into a fully peer-to-peer social networking platform.

== Chat ==
A chat has been implemented in the CADET module, for which a GTK interface for GNOME exists, specifically designed for the emerging Linux phones (such as the Librem 5 or the PinePhone).

<text>Krajina () is a Slavic toponym, meaning &#x27;country&#x27; or &#x27;march&#x27;. The term is related to &quot;kraj&quot; or &quot;krai&quot;, originally meanings &quot;land&quot;, &quot;country&quot; or &quot;edge&quot; and today denoting a region or province, usually remote from urban centers.

==Etymology==
The Serbo-Croatian word &quot;krajina&quot; derives from Proto-Slavic *&quot;krajina&quot;, derived from *&quot;krajь&quot;, related to *&quot;krojiti&quot; &#x27;to cut&#x27;; the original meaning of &quot;krajina&quot; thus seems to have been &#x27;place at an edge, fringe, borderland&#x27;, as reflected in the meanings of Church Slavonic , &quot;&quot;.

In Old East Slavic: Ѹкраина/Ꙋкраина, romanized: Oukraina [uˈkrɑjinɑ]) appears in the Hypatian Codex of c. 1425 under the year 1187 in reference to a part of the territory of Kievan Rus&#x27;, meaning specifically region or land itself rather than borderland.

In most Slavic languages (including the Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian), the root krajina is found and means &quot;country&quot;: in Polish (kraj), Slovak (krajina), Czech, Ukrainian (країна, romanised krayina), Belarusian (краіна, romanised kraina) and Sorbian. Though, in Slovenian, this word means &quot;land&quot; and march. To these languages, the word &quot;krajina&quot; was derived from Proto-Slavic &quot;*krajь&quot;, just like in Serbo-Croatian.

The name of Ukraine derives from Old East Slavic украина (&quot;ukraina&quot;) &#x27;boundary, outskirts, borderland&#x27;, a compound of оу (&quot;u&quot;) &#x27;beside, at&#x27; + краи (&quot;krai&quot;) &#x27;land, edge&#x27; + -ина (&quot;-ina&quot;), a suffix creating a feminine noun. The Proto-Slavic word *&quot;krajь&quot; generally meant &quot;edge&quot;, related to the verb *&quot;krojiti&quot; &quot;to cut (out)&quot;, in the sense of &quot;division&quot;, either &quot;at the edge, division line&quot;, or &quot;a division, region&quot;. In modern Slavic languages variations of &quot;kraj&quot; or &quot;krai&quot; mean a wide array thing, such as &quot;edge, country, land, end, region, bank, shore, side, rim, piece (of wood), area.&quot;

In some South Slavic languages, including Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, the word &quot;krajina&quot; or its cognate still refers primarily to a border, fringe, or borderland of a country (sometimes with an established military defense), and secondarily to a region, area, or landscape. Krajina is also a surname, mostly among South Slavic language speakers. The word &quot;kraj&quot; can today mean an end, extremity, region, land or area.

==Geographical regions==
===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
* Bosanska Krajina sits in a triangle roughly between Banja Luka, Prijedor and Bihać, and encompasses a larger area westwards from the Vrbas river to Una and toward the Sava on the north; while on the south it is bordered by the Unac. In medieval Bosnia the region was known as Donji Kraji.
* Cazinska Krajina is the borderland of Bosnia adjacent to Croatia around the city of Cazin. Today it constitutes Una-Sana Canton.

===Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia===
* &quot;Krajina&quot;, medieval name for the region(s) in Central Dalmatia in Croatia, including parts of Lower Neretva and western Herzegovina in today&#x27;s Bosnia and Herzegovina. It extended in the east-west direction from the lower course of the river Neretva in the east to the river Cetina in the west, and in the south-north direction from the rivers Vrljika and Trebižat and the mountains Dinara, Mosor and Biokovo in the north to the Adriatic Sea.
** Neretvanska krajina, historical area west of the river Neretva and southwest of Imotski; including a part of the peri-littoral area near Makarska in Croatia is called Krajina;
** Omiška krajina, region in the hinterland of Omiš, in Zagora in southern Croatia, west of Cetinska krajina;
** Vrgoračka krajina, area in Zagora, in southern Croatia, around the city of Vrgorac, southwest of Herzegovina and west of the Neretva valley, east of Imotska krajina;
** Vrlička krajina, area in Zagora, in southern Croatia, around the city of Vrlika, west of Livanjski kraj, northwest of Cetinska krajina (sometimes considered as part of Cetinska krajina);
** Imotska krajina, area around the city of Imotski, in Zagora in southern Croatia, constituted mostly by Imotsko polje;
** Cetinska krajina, area along the valley of the river Cetina in southern Croatia, in Zagora, west of the border with Herzegovina, constituted mostly by Sinjsko polje.

===Croatia===
* &quot;kъrainu&quot; (&quot;Krajina&quot;), medieval Glagolitic name of a Croatian province on the Baška tablet (c. 1100).
* municipality of Krajina, a former municipality located between Split and Imotski in southern Croatia, existed from 1912–1945;
* also the name of the soccer club from Imotski.
* Drniška krajina, area around the city of Drniš, in Zagora in southern Croatia.
* Istarska krajina, historical region in western Croatia, central area of Istria.
* Kninska Krajina, region around Knin in southern Croatia, north of Drniška krajina and northeast of Cetinska krajina.
* Sinjska krajina, area in Zagora in southern Croatia around the city of Sinj, west of Livanjski kraj, southeast of Vrlička krajina (sometimes considered as part of Cetinska krajina).

===Montenegro===
* Skadarska Krajina, region north of Bar and Ulcinj, across the mountain. It borders Skadar Lake on its northern edge.

===Poland===
* Krajna, historical region on the border between Greater Poland and Pomerania.

===Serbia===
* Timok Valley (), border region of Serbia adjacent to Bulgaria, around the Timok River.
** Negotin Valley (), a part of the Timok Valley around the city of Negotin.
* Koča&#x27;s krajina, an area liberated during the eighth Austrian-Turkish war.

===Slovenia===
* White Carniola (), borderland of Slovenia adjacent to Croatia.

==Political regions==

Subdivisions of Austria-Hungary:
* Military Frontier (, ), borderland of Austrian Empire against the Ottoman Empire. It was further divided into:
** Banat Krajina (on the Serbian-Romanian border);
** Croatian Krajina (on the border of western Croatia and Bosnia);
** Slavonian Krajina (on the border of Serbia and eastern Croatia with Bosnia).

Political units formed by rebel Serbs at the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence (1991–95):
*Republic of Serbian Krajina (1991–95)
*SAO Krajina
*SAO Kninska Krajina, used by some since the Yugoslav Wars to signify two regions, Knin and its surroundings, and to a larger extent Krajina proper (the main portion of the Republic of Serb Krajina).

<doc id="293693" wikidata="Q132053" url="?curid=293693" title="Puni Puni Poemy">
<text>is a Japanese two-part original video animation spin-off from the &quot;Excel Saga&quot; manga and anime television series. It features some of that series&#x27; secondary characters and many of its staff, primarily director Shinichi Watanabe. Like &quot;Excel Saga&quot;, it is a parody of other anime, manga and various aspects of popular culture, though in this case with the magical girl genre providing its primary focus and general structure. The series was originally an in-joke from an episode of &quot;Excel Saga&quot;; Watanabe decided to take the in-joke to its most extreme logical conclusion, creating the series.

==Episodes==
&quot;Puni Puni Poemy&quot; comprises two episodes, both around 26 minutes in length.
* Part 1 – Poemy is in a Bad Mood

The introductory sequence shows Poemy fighting shadowy figures of various other magical girls such as Usagi Tsukino from &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, Tickle from &quot;Majokko Tickle&quot;, Utena from &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot;, Megu and Non from &quot;Majokko Megu-chan&quot;, Sakura Kinomoto from &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;, Sally, from &quot;Sally, the Witch&quot; (considered to be the first magical girl in Japanese animation) and for some reason Mahoro from &quot;Mahoromatic&quot; despite her not being a magical girl.

At the start of a new school year the over-energetic Poemy Watanabe is introduced, along with her adoptive parents Nabeshin and Kumi-Kumi. Poemy rushes to the school to be the first there, at the same time she repeatedly proclaims her desire to become a successful voice actress. At the school, Poemy&#x27;s best girl friend, Futaba Aasu, is presented as Poemy&#x27;s biggest supporter and in fact perennially sexually attracted to her. Back from school, Poemy and Futaba realize the horror of finding Poemy&#x27;s parents and their robot dog crucified by Alien #1, an extraterrestrial assassin with peculiar genitalia. Her home destroyed, Poemy moves in with Futaba and her six sisters.

Later, a massive alien robot attacks the city, whereupon it turns out that Futaba and her sisters are actually a secret team of super-powered heroines dedicated to defending the Earth, also known as Sol III. Unfortunately, the Aasu sisters&#x27; magic is strictly defensive, so they are unable to defeat the rampaging robot. Meanwhile, Poemy obtains a talking, magic fish that when used as a magic wand transforms her into Puni Puni Poemy, a powerful magical girl. After the typical transformation, however, she promptly throws away her wand, forgoes the use of magic, and attacks the robot with her bare hands.

* Part 2 – With a Dream Greater Than Earth

Continuing from the previous scene, the wastefully energetic Poemy uses her new powers to tear through the alien mecha, destroying it. Next, Poemy decides to use her new strength to continue pursuing her career as a voice actress, and right wrongs as she sees them throughout society. However, Poemy appears to do more bad than good, as she harshly punishes citizens for small incidents, and accidentally sends a nuclear missile off-course, completely destroying an entire country. Then, the Aasu sisters finally decide to confront Puni Puni Poemy, and realize she is actually the Poemy Watanabe they have been hosting in their own house.

Afterwards, it is revealed that K, the school boy whom Poemy is attracted to, is actually an octopus-like alien, and he will be commanding the following invasion to Earth. Next morning, the invasion proceeds, with a massive Death Star en route to Earth, and with K capturing the Aasu sisters, and subjecting them to hentai-related bondage, as he learned from Japanese animation. In the end, the two alien henchmen are inexplicably revealed to be Poemy&#x27;s foster parents, Nabeshin and Kumi-Kumi, who are thus not dead, and Poemy and Futaba combine their powers in order to make the world nice and end the extraterrestrial menace.

==Characters==

The star of the show, Poemi Watanabe is 10 years old and hyperactive beyond comparison. Described as &quot;wastefully energetic&quot;, she&#x27;s an eager student, she&#x27;s got a crush on K, the popular boy in her class, and she wants to become a voice actress. She normally breaks the fourth wall by referring to herself as &quot;Kobayashi&quot;, which is the last name of her own voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Poemy also breaks the fourth wall by referring to Nabeshin as &quot;the Director&quot;, since Nabeshin is voiced by Shinichi Watanabe himself, the director of the series.

After her adoptive parents, Nabeshin and Kumi-Kumi, are killed by Alien #1, Poemy moves in with her best friend, Futaba Aasu. Then, when an alien mecha attacks the city, Poemy encounters a mysterious and silent man playing the shamisen, who is apparently her real father, and he gives her a fish, which when gutted and used as a magic wand, allows her to transform into Puni Puni Poemy, a magical girl embodying the will of Earth itself.

* Shinichi &quot;Nabeshin&quot; Watanabe (ワタナベシンイチ &quot;Watanabe Shin&#x27;ichi&quot;, ナベシン &quot;Nabeshin&quot;)

Nabeshin is the animated alter-ego of real-life director Shinichi Watanabe, who previously appeared in &quot;Puni Puni Poemy&quot; forerunner, &quot;Excel Saga&quot;. At the conclusion of that series, he married Kumi-Kumi, and at the beginning of this show, they have adopted ten-year-old Poemy. As in &quot;Excel Saga&quot;, Nabeshin seems to be constantly hunted down by different enemies, and being the director of these shows, he displays super-human abilities that involve his afro. In this occasion, Nabeshin and his wife are successfully killed by crucifixion, along with their robotic pet dog, by Alien #1. However, near the end of the second part they are inexplicably alive and appear to be the alien henchmen themselves.

Introduced in &quot;Excel Saga&quot;, Kumi-Kumi was a simple mountain girl who rescued Nabeshin from an avalanche and attempted to feed him soup. But Nabeshin isn&#x27;t too good with hot foods, so he refused, only to have her pursue him across the rest of the series. He finally relented, marrying her at the end of the final episode. At the start of &quot;Puni Puni Poemy,&quot; she and Nabeshin now have Poemy as their adopted daughter. Despite being killed by the alien invader along with Nabeshin, Kumi-Kumi apparently saved her husband using acupuncture, and they are both alright at the end of the second part.

* K (Kくん &quot;K-kun&quot;)

K is one of Poemy&#x27;s classmates, but unfortunately for Poemy, her wild crush on him isn&#x27;t reciprocated. In the second episode, K discovers that he is an octopus-like alien who had been raised in human form for ten years, and he takes charge of the invasion of the planet, which is focused on ravishing Japanese women, since hentai transmissions have given the aliens the idea that that&#x27;s what women are really like. K, whose real name is Space Alien Prince, is composed entirely of tentacles as he and his family parody the Mars People from the game series &quot;Metal Slug&quot;. 

* Mage Queen (魔道士の女王 &quot;Madō-shi no joō&quot;)

A mysterious figure, the precise nature of the Mage Queen is not explained. Initially, her somewhat threatening monologue aboard a space station that oversees Earth seems to count her an enemy. However, she greets the eventual arrival of Puni Puni Poemy with joy and considers the invading aliens a threat. Her reign as queen of the magic is cut short when she is assassinated by Alien #2. Her design is based on the female characters of Leiji Matsumoto.

* Alien Henchmen

 – Alien 1

 – Alien 2

These extraterrestrial assassins dress like pimps from the waist up and speak in an undecipherable hipster jargon. Their genitalia look like Bungee Balls that hang down to their knees, and can be used as sort of like whips. Alien #1 has one such testicle, and Alien #2 has two, and no reason for this anatomical difference is given. Early in the first episode, Alien #1 kills Nabeshin and Kumi-Kumi, and then controls the giant robot that attacks the city. Then, during most of the second episode, he spends his time at the Aasu household completely unnoticed, even joining the girls in the bathtub, until he captures them. Alien #2&#x27;s main role is in arriving with a giant battleship and attacking the Mage Queen. Ultimately, both alien henchmen are not whom they appear to be, as in a paradox they take off their disguises and reveal to be Nabeshin and Kumi-Kumi, who are alive and well.

===The Aasu Sisters===
Poemy&#x27;s classmate, Futaba, is but one of the seven Aasu sisters, protectors of Earth. &quot;Aasu&quot; is the Japanese transliteration of the English word &quot;Earth&quot;, and each of the girl&#x27;s names is derived from a number: seven, six, five, and so on. All of the girls have magical powers, but given that these powers are purely defensive in nature, the family is useless as an offensive unit. Additionally to their family name referring to the Earth, &quot;aasu&quot; is also the Japanese transliteration of the English words &quot;arse&quot; or &quot;ass&quot;, which is comically exploited in the English dub, such as the character Futaba saying &quot;save my Aasus&quot; when the sisters are captured.

* Nanase Aasu (ああすななせ &quot;Āsu Nanase&quot;)

At 28 years old, Nanase is the eldest sister, who works as a data processor in an office. Her power is the Earth Dance of Flowers, the ability to summon a whirlwind of flowers, to absolutely no effect. Her name is derived from &quot;nana&quot;, the Japanese word for &quot;seven&quot;.

* Mutsumi Aasu (ああすむつみ &quot;Āsu Mutsumi&quot;)

Mutsumi is 22 years old, and much to her own surprise speaks with a Kansai accent (in the English language dub a Brooklyn accent is used). She has something of a complex about the small size of her breasts. Her power is the Earth Breakfall, which means she can fall over safely. Her name is derived from &quot;mutsu&quot;, the Japanese word for &quot;six&quot;. Her short, purple hair, and her white outfit, make her physically similar to the first Ropponmatsu from &quot;Excel Saga&quot;.

* Itsue Aasu (ああすいつえ &quot;Āsu Itsue&quot;)

The 19-year-old Itsue is working her way through high school as a dominatrix, and is prone to using her whip to physically abuse her sisters when she gets angry. Her power, the Earth Barrier Shield, enables her to generate a protective energy field, which she activates while spinning her whip. Her name comes from &quot;itsu&quot;, the Japanese word for &quot;five&quot;.

* Shii Aasu (ああすしい &quot;Āsu Shī&quot;)

Shii is 18 years old, and her most distinctive feature are her excessively large breasts. She constantly grabs them and announces how heavy they are, but in one occasion she mentioned she would use Poemy&#x27;s magic to make them much smaller. Her special power is Earth Healing, which does no damage. Her name comes from &quot;shi&quot;, the Japanese word for &quot;four&quot;. Shii has blue hair and resembles Hyatt from &quot;Excel Saga&quot;, and in fact, both characters have the same voice actresses, Omi Minami and Monica Rial.

* Mitsuki Aasu (ああすみつき &quot;Āsu Mitsuki&quot;)

Cute and energetic, Mitsuki is 15 years old, and seems to play an active role in the running of the Aasu household. Initially, she opposes the idea of letting Poemy stay with them, and later she distrusts Puni Puni Poemy&#x27;s actions. Her power is Earth Acceleration, enabling her to run at vast speeds. Her name is derived from &quot;mittsu&quot;, the Japanese word for &quot;three&quot;. With her long ponytail Mitsuki is physically similar to Misaki Matsuya from &quot;Excel Saga&quot;.

* Futaba Aasu (ああすふたば &quot;Āsu Futaba&quot;)

10-year-old Futaba is Poemy&#x27;s classmate and best friend, and she is madly in love with her, a fact to which Poemy is oblivious. Futaba&#x27;s power allows her to pacify hostile creatures, making them happy and harmless. In the final confrontation with the invading aliens, Futaba combines her power with Poemy&#x27;s, and since Poemy is a representation of Earth, this act pacifies the planet&#x27;s population, resulting in peace with the aliens. After this event, director Nabeshin casually mentions that Futaba is in reality the main character of the show. Her name comes from &quot;futa&quot;, the Japanese word for &quot;two&quot;. Futaba is mostly a parody of Tomoyo Daidouji, the best friend of magical girl Sakura Kinomoto from &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;. Unlike Tomoyo, however, Futaba displays more extreme fantasies and lesbian arousal whenever she is with her friend.

* Hitomi Aasu (ああすひとみ &quot;Āsu Hitomi&quot;)

The youngest of the Aasu sisters, at only 3 years old, Hitomi is in a hurry to grow up and grow breasts. She possesses the power of precognition, although it is not very good because she mostly foresees the obvious. Whenever she is having a vision, she seems to have bowel movements. Her name comes from &quot;hito&quot;, the Japanese word for &quot;one&quot;.

==Reception==
Lynzee Loveridge called the series an &quot;over-the-top magical girl premise&quot; which lampoons the magical girl genre, with &quot;bondage, crucified robot dogs, and weird alien dicks&quot;.

===Banning in New Zealand===
Due to its sexual and violent scenes, the Classification Office banned &quot;Puni Puni Poemy&quot; in New Zealand. A New Zealand anime fan, Simon Brady, unsuccessfully appealed to the Film and Literature Board of Review to change the classification, citing that the show was only rated MA15+ in Australia. However, the Board of Review stated that a program would be banned if they felt that it promoted the exploitation of children or young persons for sexual purposes, extreme violence and extreme cruelty.

On 8 June 2021, the Classification Office re-classified &quot;Puni Puni Poemy&quot; R16 after granting a request from a member of the public to reconsider the classification of the series.

<doc id="293699" wikidata="Q6942570" url="?curid=293699" title="Musical similarity">
<text>The notion of musical similarity is particularly complex because there are numerous dimensions of similarity. If similarity takes place between different fragments from one musical piece, a musical similarity implies a repetition of the first occurring fragment. As well, eventually, the similarity does not occur by direct repetition, but by presenting in two (or more) set of relations, some common values or patterns. Objective musical similarity can be based on musical features such as:

Pitched parameters
* Pitch interval similarity
* Melodic similarity
* Modulation pattern similarity
* Timbral similarity

Non-pitched parameters
* Metrical structure similarity
* Rhythmic pattern similarity
* Section structure similarity

Semiotic parameters
* Modality structure similarity
* Extensional similarity
* Intensional similarity

Nevertheless, similarity can be based also on less objective features such as musical genre, personal history, social context (e.g. music from the 1960s), and a priori knowledge.

Similarity is relevant also in music information retrieval.
Finally, musical similarity can be extended to the comparison between musical gestures in performance and composition.

==Applications==
Automatic methods of musical similarity detection based on data mining and co-occurrence analysis has been developed in order to classify music titles for electronic music distribution.

<text>The following lists events that happened during [[1966]] in [[Afghanistan]].

Thanks largely to the intelligent use made of the aid given by the U.S.S.R., the United States, West Germany, Britain, China, and the World Bank, the internal economy of the country made good progress.

The first five-year plan, which began in 1956, aimed at encouraging agriculture, especially irrigation. Experience showed, however, that progress in these spheres could only be partially achieved as long as internal communications remained primitive and the natural resources of the country were largely unexplored. As a result, the major effort was diverted to the construction of roads and airports, and to the systematic investigation of sources of water supply and of mineral wealth.

During the course of the second five-year plan, conditions became favourable on many economic front. Promising deposits of natural gas and of iron ore were discovered; the power available for industrial use increased dramatically; and the extension of irrigation led to substantially increased agricultural production.

In Afghanistan, as in many other underdeveloped countries, however, this rapid success led to the emergence of new problems, unforeseen in the original planning: inflation of prices, difficulties over foreign exchange, and an unhealthy reliance on large-scale external aid for the easing of current domestic shortages. The indications are that the third five-year plan will aim mainly at consolidating what has already been achieved rather than at any new major advances.

==Incumbents==
* Monarch - Mohammed Zahir Shah
* Prime Minister - Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal

==January 1966==
The break with the past represented by the new democratic constitution inaugurated in 1965 is further underlined by the appointment of a woman, Kubra Noorzai, to the cabinet as Minister of Public Health. Under the new constitution, women can both vote and stand as candidates, and in September 1965, four were returned to the new National Assembly. Even so, Miss Noorzai&#x27;s elevation to cabinet rank is regarded as a striking illustration of the determination of King Mohammad Zahir Shah and of the government headed by Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal to bring the country into line with modern ideas on the political and social status of women.

==April 4–8, 1966==
Cordiality with the People&#x27;s Republic of China is cemented by a visit to Kabul by President Liu Shaoqi and Marshal Chen Yi. Afghanistan maintains its traditional policy of friendliness without involvement, its relations with Communist and non-Communist countries being equally cordial. The former friction with Pakistan has also ceased.

==End of 1966==
The first parliament created under the new democratic constitution adjourns for the winter recess. Its relations with the Maiwandwal cabinet were close and cordial, and it gave full support to the government&#x27;s efforts to achieve national financial stability. Drastic cuts were made in government expenditure and, due to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the country is able to face with confidence the completion of the second five-year plan and the beginning in May 1967 of the third five-year plan.

<text>Sepak takraw, or Sepaktakraw, also called buka ball, kick volleyball or foot volleyball, is a team sport. It is played with a ball made of rattan or plastic between two teams of two to four players on a court resembling a badminton court. It is similar to volleyball and footvolley in its use of a rattan ball and players using only their feet, knees, shoulders, chest and head to touch the ball. Sepak Takraw is often referred to as a mixture of volleyball, due to its use of a net, and association football, as players use their feet.

The sport&#x27;s modern version was introduced, developed and standardized in 1960 when officials from Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Myanmar met in Kuala Lumpur to agree on a name and standard rules for it. It was previously known as Sepak Raga Jaring, and was first exhibited in Penang in 1945. It was introduced in the 1965 Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur as a medal event. Sepak Takraw is considered Malaysia&#x27;s national sport.

Sepak takraw is governed internationally by the International Sepaktakraw Federation (ISTAF), formed in 1988, which is responsible for major international tournaments including the ISTAF SuperSeries (ISS) and ISTAF World Cup (IWC), Malaysia&#x27;s Khir Johari Cup, and Thailand&#x27;s King Cup.

Sepak takraw resembles native sports known as &quot;Sepak Raga&quot; in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore; &quot;Takraw and Rago/Raga&quot; in Indonesia; &quot;Sipa&quot; in the Philippines; &quot;Chinlone&quot; in Myanmar; &quot;Takraw&quot; in Thailand; &quot;Kataw&quot; in Laos; and &quot;Sek Dai&quot; in Cambodia. It is also claimed to be related to &quot;Cuju&quot; in China, &quot;Cau May&quot; in Vietnam, &quot;Jegichagi&quot; in Korea and &quot;Kemari&quot; in Japan.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;sepak&quot; is Malay (Jawi: سيڨق) for kick while the word &quot;takraw&quot; is of Thai (Thai: ตะกร้อ) origin, translated as muzzle or woven rattan ball. &quot;Sepak Takraw&quot; quite literally means &quot;to kick a rattan ball&quot;. The choice of this name for the sport was essentially a compromise between Malaysia and Thailand in Kuala Lumpur in 1960.

In the past, it was called &quot;Sepak Raga Jaring&quot; in Malaysia, after the term &quot;Jaring&quot;, meaning net in Malay, was added to the traditional &quot;Sepak Raga&quot; game when it was created by Hamid Mydin in Penang in 1945. In Thailand, it is simply known by its original name of &quot;Takraw&quot;. Internationally, only the term &quot;Sepak Takraw&quot; is used to refer to the modern sport.

==History==

===Predecessors===

Sepak Takraw may have been introduced to Southeast Asia by the Chinese, who were inspired by the traditional game &quot;Cuju&quot;, an ancient military exercise where soldiers play to keep a leather ball filled with feathers airborne by kicking it back and forth between two or more people. As the game evolved, the feather-stuffed ball was replaced by an air-filled ball with a two-layered hull. &quot;Cuju&quot; is also considered by the International Football Association (FIFA) as the origin of football as a sport.

In Myanmar, Sepak Takraw is known as &quot;chinlone&quot;. Chinlone has played a prominent role in Myanmar for about 1,500 years. Its style is performance-based because it was first created as a demonstrative activity to entertain Burmese royalty. Chinlone is heavily influenced by traditional Burmese martial arts and dance.

In Malaysia, the first recorded instance of Sepak Takraw, with balls made of woven strips of rattan, was in the Malacca Sultanate (present-day Malaysia) in the 15th century, according to an ancient Malay manuscript, &quot;Sejarah Melayu&quot; (Malay Annals). The Malay Annals described an incident involving Raja Muhammad, a son of Sultan Mansur Shah, who was accidentally hit with a rattan ball by Tun Besar, the son of Bendahara Tun Perak, in a Sepak Raga game. The ball hit Raja Muhammad&#x27;s headgear and knocked it to the ground. Angered, Raja Muhammad immediately stabbed and killed Tun Besar, leading to some of Tun Besar&#x27;s kinsmen wanting to kill Raja Muhammad in retaliation. However, Bendahara Tun Perak managed to restrain them from an act of treason by saying that he would no longer accept Raja Muhammad as the Sultan&#x27;s heir. Sultan Mansur Shah ordered his son out of Malacca and had him installed as the ruler of neighbouring Pahang.
In Thailand, there is evidence that the Thai played Sepak Takraw during the reign of King Naresuan (1590–1605) of Ayutthaya Kingdom. A French historian, François Henri Turpin, wrote about how the Siamese played the game of Takraw to stay in shape. Murals at Bangkok&#x27;s Wat Phra Kaeo, built in 1785, depict the Hindu god Hanuman playing Sepak Takraw in a ring with a troop of monkeys. The game was played in a circle for hundreds of years, until modern Sepak Takraw began taking shape in Thailand sometime during the early 1740s. In 1929, the Siam Sports Association drafted the first rules for Takraw competition. Four years later, the association introduced the volleyball-style net and held the first public contest. Within just a few years, Takraw was introduced to the curriculum in Siamese schools. The game became such a cherished local custom that another exhibition of volleyball-style Takraw was held to celebrate the kingdom&#x27;s first constitution in 1933, the year after Thailand abolished absolute monarchy.

In Indonesia, Sepak Takraw is also known as Sepak Raga. In Sulawesi, the traditional Bugis football game is called &quot;Raga&quot; (the player is called &quot;Pa&#x27;Raga&quot;). Men play the &quot;Raga&quot; circle in a group, where the ball is passed from one to the other, and the man who kicks the highest ball is the winner. &quot;Raga&quot; is also played for fun by demonstrating several tricks, such as kicking the ball and placing it on the player&#x27;s head with the handle of the &quot;tengkolok bugis&quot; (Bugis headgear similar to a Malay &quot;tanjak&quot;).

In the Philippines, the sport is related to a native game called &quot;&quot;sipà&quot; (or &quot;sipà salama&quot;&quot; among Muslim Filipinos), and along with traditional martial arts, survived Spanish colonization. It is a popular sport played by children in Philippines, and was the Philippine national sport until it was replaced by Arnis in 2009. Sepak Takraw is included in Philippine&#x27;s elementary and high school curriculum.

===Origins of the modern sport===
In the beginning, Sepak Takraw was not meant to be competitive, but was a casual game with an emphasis on physical activity. The game acted as an exercise to improve dexterity and loosen the limbs after long periods of sitting, standing or working. However, the modern version of Sepak Takraw began taking shape sometime during the 1940s. In 1935 in Seremban, Sepak Raga was first played on a badminton court over the net with players on two opposing sides, amid celebrations of the Silver Jubilee of George V. The event is the earliest example of modern sport rules being used for Sepak Raga, turning it into a competitive sport. Badminton was a preferred sport for the British, whereas Sepak Raga was mainly played by the Malays. Since the diversion sport was first played amid the Jubilee festivity, it was known as &quot;Sepak Raga Jubilee&quot; (Jubilee Sepak Raga).
It is likely that the sport had gained popularity in Negeri Sembilan, and spread to various states of Malaya (now West Malaysia). In the years following World War II up to the mid-20th century, &quot;Sepak Raga Jubilee&quot; was played in rural villages and towns throughout Malaya. Though Malaysia is a multiracial country, Sepak Takraw is mainly popular among the Malay community. The new sport then spread to Penang. The popularization of present-day Sepak Takraw is, for the most part, attributed to three people from Jalan Patani, Penang. In February 1945, a net and tenets like badminton were presented by Hamid Mydin, accompanied by local Sepak Raga sportsmen, Mohamad Abdul Rahman and Syed Yaacob to demonstrate Mydin&#x27;s new variation of &quot;Sepak Raga Jaring&quot; (Net Sepak Raga). The new version was preferred due to quicker pace, distinctive styles of kicking and the higher standard of athleticism that it demanded. It is considered the pioneer version of modern Sepak Takraw and remains one of the dominant competitive forms.

The first properly organized Sepak Takraw competition was held at a Swim Club in Penang on May 16, 1945. Three teams from Malay populated localities in Penang were among those that competed for the Nyak Din Nyak Sham Trophy. The sport spread rapidly through the remainder of Malaya. From Penang, &quot;Sepak Raga Jaring&quot; spread to Alor Setar in Kedah, to Kampung Baru in Kuala Lumpur and then to Singapore. By 1960, the variation was well known in many Malayan schools that had badminton courts. The sport was frequently played by football players because of the similarities in skills required for both sports. Several Sepak Raga associations formed in various Malayan states.

About the same time, similar developments occurred in Thailand. In 1929, the Siam Sports Association drafted the first rules for the Takraw competition. Four years later, the association introduced the volleyball-style net and held the first public contest. Within just a few years, Takraw was added to the curriculum in Siamese schools. The game became such a cherished local custom that another exhibition of volleyball-style Takraw was staged to celebrate the kingdom&#x27;s first constitution in 1933, the year after Thailand abolished its absolute monarchy.

===Standardization===

The determination and perseverance of Penang&#x27;s Sepak Takraw pioneers led to the founding of the &quot;Jawatankuasa Penaja Sepak Raga Pulau Pinang&quot; (Penang Sepak Raga Sponsors&#x27; Committee) on 25 March 1956 at Dewan UMNO Pulau Pinang. On 28 January 1960, the committee negotiated with representatives from Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Kedah and Singapore at Bangunan Persatuan Melayu Pulau Pinang on the founding of &quot;Jawatankuasa Penaja Perseketuan Sepak Raga Jaring Malaya&quot; (Malayan Sepak Raga Jaring Sponsors&#x27; Committee), a national organization. The initial rules and regulations of the sport were enacted and compiled in writing on 15 April 1960 at Sultan Sulaiman Club in Kuala Lumpur.

On 25 June 1960, the Malayan Sepak Raga Federation (now renamed Malaysian Sepak Takraw Association (PSM)) was established at a meeting held in Balai Rakyat, Jalan Patani, Penang. The ceremony was officiated by the Chief Minister of Penang, Wong Pow Nee. During the meeting, representatives of Kedah, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Penang had unanimously appointed Khir Johari as its first President. Hamid Mydin was also recognized as the creator and founder of Sepak Takraw by the federation at that meeting. The Sepak Raga rules compiled on 15 April in Kuala Lumpur were also ratified by the Malayan Sepak Raga Federation on this day.

Later that year, representatives from Malaya, Singapore, Myanmar and Thailand met in Kuala Lumpur to standardize the guidelines for the sport. After intense debate, they came to a consensus that the sport would be officially called &quot;Sepak Takraw&quot;. Thus, a game of Sepak Takraw that witnesses acrobatic movements by athletes was officially introduced at the international level. In Malaya, an inter-state competition known as &quot;Khir Johari Gold Cup&quot; was organized at Stadium Negara, Kuala Lumpur from 27 to 28 December 1962 to further advance the sport. Penang, where Sepak Raga Jaring originated, would become the primary holder of the tournament. By that point, &quot;Sepak Raga Jaring&quot; was quite popular in Malaya, and is now regarded as Malaysia&#x27;s national sport.

===Global game===

In 1965, the Asian Sepaktakraw Federation (ASTAF) was formed. Its first task was to translate the Sepak Takraw rules into English, facilitating the first worldwide competition, the Southeast Asian Peninsular Games (SEAP Games) (now Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games)) held in Kuala Lumpur. It was still confusingly known as &quot;Sepak Raga&quot;. From the fourth SEAP Games in 1967, the term &quot;Sepak Takraw&quot; become the established name.

In the 1970 Asian Games at Bangkok, Sepak Takraw was introduced as a demonstration sport by Malaysian and Thai teams.

In 1975, the Kedah&#x27;s Sepak Takraw team visited Germany in conjunction with The Sports Press Feast 1975 to play Sepak Takraw as a demonstration.

In 1977, Penang&#x27;s Sepak Takraw team participated in North Malaysian Week in Adelaide, Australia.

In 1979, ASTAF for the first time held a conference in Jakarta in conjunction with the SEA Games and reviewed the Sepak Takraw laws submitted by the Malaysian Sepak Takraw Association. The ASTAF technical committee also held its second meeting in Singapore in the same year for the same purpose.

In 1980, the Malaysian Sepak Takraw team played several Sepak Takraw games in China, South Korea and Hong Kong, an outstanding achievement in the history of Sepak Takraw towards introducing the sport to East Asian countries.

In 1982, the woven synthetic ball was introduced to replace woven rattan ball in Thailand.

In 1988, the International Sepaktakraw Federation (ISTAF) was formed by members of the Asian Sepaktakraw Federation (ASTAF). It was recognised as the international governing body for the sport by the Olympic Movement in 1990.

In 1990, Sepak Takraw was included as a medal sport at the Asian Games in Beijing.

In 1997, the first women&#x27;s championship was held in Thailand.

In 1998, Sepak Takraw was introduced as a demonstration event in the Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur.

In 2011, the inaugural edition of Sepak Takraw&#x27;s flagship tournament, the ISTAF World Cup, was staged in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The ISTAF SuperSeries, a new series of elite tournaments was also launched in Bangkok.

There are more than 30 countries with national Sepak Takraw organizations, with representatives in the International Sepaktakraw Federation (ISTAF) overseeing the sport.

==Competition==

International play is now governed by ISTAF. Major competitions for the sport such as the ISTAF SuperSeries, the ISTAF World Cup and the King&#x27;s Cup World Championships are held every year.

Sepak Takraw is now a regular sport event in the Asian Games and the Southeast Asian Games, with Thailand having won the most medals for the event.

===Asian Games===

Sepak Takraw has been a sport at the Asian Games since 1990 with Thailand securing the highest number of gold medals.

===Canada===
The Lao people first brought Sepak Takraw into Canada when they immigrated as refugees in the 1970s. But the game began gaining exposure outside the Laotian communities when a Saskatchewan teacher, Richard (Rick) Engel, who was introduced to Sepak Takraw while living in Asia, included it in Asian Sport, Education &amp; Culture (ASEC) International&#x27;s School Presentation Program. Sepak Takraw was so well received by schools that it became part of ASEC&#x27;s mandate to help introduce, promote and organize the sport across the country. In May 1998, after introducing many schools to the sport, and in concert with experienced players, ASEC International organised the first Canadian inter-provincial tournament with men&#x27;s, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; teams. By the end of 1998, Engel was sent to Bangkok, Thailand to film at the 14th King&#x27;s Cup Sepak Takraw World Championships – the footage of which was used to produce a widely used instructional Sepak Takraw video/DVD, called &quot;Sepak Takraw – Just for Kicks&quot;.

On 11 December 1998, the Sepak Takraw Association of Canada (STAC) was incorporated to organise and govern the sport nationally. Its office was set up in Regina, Saskatchewan, where there were experienced players and organizational support, sharing resources and office space of the already established ASEC International, a committee which has now become Sepak Takraw Saskatchewan Inc. The first annual Canadian Open Sepak Takraw Championships (a national and international tournament event) were held in May 1999 in Regina, and have over the years attracted teams from across Canada, the United States, Japan, Malaysia and China. That same year Canada also attended its first International Sepaktakraw Federation (ISTAF) Congress and was accepted as member of ISTAF. In 2000, Rick Engel, Perry Senko and Brydon Blacklaws played for Team Canada and earned a silver medal in the entry level division of the King&#x27;s Cup World Sepak Takraw Championships in Thailand. Another major milestone was achieved on 3 December 2000, when STAC and the sport of Sepak Takraw became an official class E Member of the Canadian Olympic Committee.

Canada has since contributed much to the development of Sepak Takraw worldwide, with Engel authoring three instructional books and helping produce five DVDs about the sport, while STAC did the publishing. The most notable of these books is &quot;Sepak Takraw 101 - The Complete Coaching/Instructional Manual for Sepak Takraw (Kick Volleyball)&quot;, the third edition of which has also been translated into Indonesian and published in Indonesia through a government education project. Engel has since introduced the sport and conducted Sepak Takraw skills clinics in schools and sessions at physical education teachers&#x27; conferences all over Canada, the US and Europe.

===Japan===
A Japanese team played at the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing. While as of 2010 there are no professional teams in Japan, university-level teams have been established at Asia University, Chiba University, Keio University, and Waseda University.

===Philippines===
Sepak Takraw is also known as &quot;Sipa&quot; in the Philippines. The Philippine Sepak Takraw team competes internationally. Among veteran players still in the lineup are Jason Huerta, Reyjay Ortuste, Mark Joseph Gonzales, Josefina Maat, Des Oltor, Ronsted Cabayeron and Sara Catain.

===United States===
The earliest accounts of organized Takraw in the United States involve a group of students from Northrop University (Greg St. Pierre, Thomas Gong, Joel &quot;big bird&quot; Nelson, and Mark Kimitsuka) in 1986 in Inglewood, California, learning about and playing the sport in Los Angeles. In the early 80s, Southeast Asians held soccer tournaments with Takraw events in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and California, especially within the Lao, Hmong and Thai communities. Malaysian students attending the university often enjoyed playing the sport on a court atop the dormitory cafeteria. They taught a handful of curious American students how to play, which in turn inspired Malaysia Airlines to sponsor a US team from the university to attend the National Tournament in Kuala Lumpur in November 1987. The Northrop team played in a bracket of international new teams with Korea, Sri Lanka, and Australia. The US team beat Sri Lanka and Australia to bring home the gold.

The Los Angeles Asian community and Northrop&#x27;s team had already established a Takraw community in and around the city. Kurt Sonderegger moved to Los Angeles, founded the United States Takraw Association, and started a business that sold plastic Takraw balls. In 1989, he was sent an invitation from the International Sepaktakraw Federation, and along with a few of the Northrop group, travelled to represent the United States in the World Championships.

The team was well beaten but the Takraw world celebrated the participation of non-Asian teams in the World Championships.

==Rules and regulations==
Measurements of courts and equipment often vary among tournaments and organisations that operate from a recreational to a competitive level; &quot;international competitive rules and regulations are used in this section.&quot; There are two types of event categories: the regu and the doubles regu. The regu category is played by three players on each team while the doubles regu is played by two players on each team.

===Expressions===
&quot;Takraw&quot; is the Thai word for the hand-woven rattan ball originally used in the game. Therefore, the game is essentially &quot;kick ball&quot;. The concept of Footvolley originates from Thai Takraw pronounced (Tha-Graw). It is also sometimes incorrectly referred to by foreigners as &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot;; however, it is an ancient game mainly enjoyed between Thailand and Laos.

===Court===

Sepak Takraw is played on court a similar to badminton&#x27;s double sized court.

The court has an area of free from all obstacles up to the height of measured from the floor surface (sand and grass court not advisable). The width of the lines bounding the court should not be more than measured and drawn inwards from the edge of the court measurements. All the boundary lines should be drawn at least away from all obstacles. The center line of should be drawn equally dividing the right and left court.

Where the center line meets the sidelines, quarter circles shall be drawn, on either side, from the sideline to the center line with a radius of measured and drawn outwards from the edge of the 0.9 m radius .

The service circle of 0.3 m radius shall be drawn on the left and on the right court, the center of which is 2.45 m from the back line of the court and 3.05 m from the sidelines, the 0.04 m line shall be measured and drawn outward from the edge of the 0.3 m radius.

===Net===
The net should be made of fine ordinary cord or nylon with 6 cm to 8 cm mesh, similar to a volleyball net.

The net should be 0.7 m in width and not shorter than 6.10 m in length, taped at 0.05 m from tape double at the top and sideline, called boundary tape.

The net should be edged with 0.05 m tape double at the top and the bottom of the net supported by a fine ordinary cord or nylon cord that runs through the tape and strain over and flush with the top of the posts. The top of the net shall be 1.52 m (1.42 m for women) in height from the center and 1.55 m (1.45 m for women) at the posts. In Myanmar they now used at least 1.82m or 2.43m depend on the situation as the standard height is too short and can kick in easily.

===Ball===

The Sepak Takraw ball should be spherical, made of synthetic fibre or one woven layer.

Sepak Takraw balls without synthetic rubber covering must have 12 holes and 20 intersections, must have a circumference measuring from for men or from for women, with a weight that ranges from for men or from for women.

The ball can be any single or multi-color, but must not be in any color that would impair the performance of the players.

The Sepak Takraw ball can also be constructed of synthetic rubber or soft durable material for covering the ball, for the purpose of softening the impact of the ball on the player&#x27;s body. The type of material and method used for constructing the ball or for covering the ball with rubber or soft durable covering must be approved by ISTAF before it can be used for any competition.

All world, international, and regional competitions sanctioned by International Sepaktakraw Federation, including but not limited to, the Olympic Games, World Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and SEA Games, must be played with ISTAF approved Sepak Takraw balls.

===Players===
A match is played by two teams called &#x27;regu&#x27;, each consisting of three players. On some occasions, it can be played by only two players (doubles) or four players (quadrant) per team.

One of the players, standing at the back, is called a &quot;Tekong&quot;, also known as the &quot;Server&quot;. The other two players stand close to the net, one on the left and the other on the right. The player on the left is called a &quot;feeder/setter/tosser&quot; and the player on the right is called a &quot;attacker/striker/killer&quot;.

===Start of play and service===
The side that must serve first should start the first set. The side that wins the first set should have the option of &quot;Choosing Service&quot;.

The throw must be executed as soon as the referee calls the score. If either of the &quot;Inside&quot; players throws the ball before the referee calls the score, it must be re-thrown and a warning will be given to the thrower.

During the service, as soon as the Tekong kicks the ball, all the players are allowed to move about freely in their respective courts.

The service is valid if the ball passes over the net, whether it touches the net or not, and inside the boundary of the two net tapes and boundary lines of the opponent&#x27;s court.

===Faults in the game===

====Serving side during service====
* The &quot;Inside&quot; player who is throwing to the server plays with the ball (throwing up the ball, bumping, passing to another &quot;Inside&quot; player etc.) after the call of score by the referee.
* The &quot;Inside&quot; player lifts their feet or steps on the line or crosses over or touches the net while throwing the ball.
* The Tekong jumps off the ground to execute the service.
* The Tekong does not kick the ball on the service throw.
* The ball touches a serving side player before crossing over to the opponents&#x27; court.
* The ball goes over the net but falls outside the court.
* The ball does not cross to the opponent side.
* A player uses their hand or hands, or any other part of his arms to facilitate the execution of a kick even if the hand or arm does not directly touch the ball, but it touches other objects or surfaces instead when doing so.

====Serving and receiving side during service====
* Creating distractions or noise or shouting at an opponent.

====For both sides during the game====
* Any player who touches the ball on the opponent side.
* Any part of player&#x27;s body crosses over into opponent&#x27;s court whether above or under the net except during the follow-through of the ball.
* Playing the ball more than 3 times in succession.
* The ball touching the arm

* The ball touches the ceiling, roof or the wall (any objects).

===Scoring system===
An official doubles or regu match is won by best of three sets (win 2 out of 3 sets), with each set being played up to 21 points.

A team event or group match is effectively three regu matches played back to back, using different players for each regu. The winner is determined by best of three regus (win 2 out of 3 regus), where a winner of each individual regu is determined by best of 3 sets, played up to 21 points per set.

In the last or third set a change of sides takes place when one team reaches 11 points.

When either serving or receiving side commits a fault, a point is awarded to the opponent side.

Serving: Teams alternate serving every three points, regardless of who wins the points. If a tie takes place at 21-21, each team alternates one serve each until a winner is determined.

Set: Each set is won by the side which scores 21 points with a minimum lead of two points to a ceiling of 25 points. In the event of a 21–21 tie, the set shall be won by the side which gets a lead of two points, or when a side reaches 25 points (whichever occurs first).

Match: A match is won by the team who has won two sets. A team event match is won by the team that wins two regus.

Ranking: In group stages of tournaments or team events (round robin) the ranking in a group is determined by:
1. Sum of match wins; a match win gives 1 point
2. Sum of set points
3. Points difference +/-

<text>The 18th Street Gang, also known as &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, or simply &#x27; in North America, is a multi-ethnic (largely Central American and Mexican) street gang in Los Angeles. It is one of the largest street gangs in Los Angeles, with 30,000–50,000 members between the United States, Mexico, and Central America. A United States Department of Justice report featured the following statement regarding 18th Street and rival gang MS-13, &quot;These two gangs have turned the Central American northern triangle into the area with the highest homicide rate in the world.&quot;

== History ==
The 18th Street Gang was formed in the Rampart District of Los Angeles in the 1960s by Mexican-Americans and other immigrant youths who were not accepted into existing Hispanic gangs. Some were originally part of Clanton 14 but wanted to make a separate clique called &quot;Clanton 18th Street&quot; and allow immigrants the opportunity to join. This proposal was rejected by the Clanton 14, which led to the formation of the 18th Street Gang. The two gangs have been bitter rivals ever since.

18th Street grew by expanding its membership to other nationalities and races, and it was among the first multiracial, multi-ethnic gangs in Los Angeles. In the beginning, they were made up largely of second-generation Hispanics. As the 18th Street Gang began to battle with more established Hispanic gangs, they began to recruit outside the Hispanic community. There are approximately two hundred separate, autonomous gangs operating under the same name within separate barrios in the San Fernando Valley; specifically, in North Hollywood, the San Gabriel Valley, South Bay, Riverside, East Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, Northeast Los Angeles, Pico Union, Westlake, Koreatown, Inglewood, South Gate, Huntington Park, Maywood, Bellflower, Long Beach, Orange County, San Bernardino County, and Los Angeles&#x27; Westside or West LA, according to the latest figures from the NDIC. In the early 2000s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation initiated wide-scale raids against known and suspected gang members, netting hundreds of arrests across the country. In Philippines, John Germynn Buerano also known as SUPREMO was the leader of 18th Street Gang.

=== Central America===
18th Street started as a Mexican American gang, but the gang also became Central American as it started to recruit more members of other ethnic groups. When Central American gang members were arrested in the United States, they were then deported back to Central America, where the gang arose not just in El Salvador, but also in Honduras and Guatemala, becoming one of the most violent gangs in the region. 18th Street later became a bitter rival of MS-13 as both gangs sought supremacy in Central America. Members of 18th Street are mainly Mexican, Salvadoran, Honduran, and Guatemalan, but the gang does have members from other parts of Central America. 18th Street influences have recently been spotted in Belize as well.

In El Salvador, a faction called the &quot;&quot;Revolucionarios&quot; (&quot;Revolutionaries&quot;) split off 18th Street in 2005, becoming rivals with the other members, who came to be known as the &quot;Sureños&quot; (&quot;Southerners.&quot;)

== Description ==
=== Location ===
The majority of 18th Street cliques operate throughout Southern California, but are active in other states and internationally as well. Los Angeles members began migrating to other areas outside California and started to establish their own gangs. 18th Street gangs are active in 44 cities in 20 U.S. states, as well internationally reported in Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Lebanon, Peru, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela and Philippines.

=== Organization ===
The organization of the 18th Street Gang differs from location to location. With the gang being spread so vastly nationally and internationally, it is difficult to have a universal organizational structure. The gang is organized in such a way that allows for leadership at every level. One common organizational structure seen used by Barrio 18 is as follows. At the very top are “palabreros” or “leaders,” a majority of these members are in prison, but still help run the gang by coordinating all criminal activities. “Palabreros” also exist outside of the prison and are known as “en la libre.” Lastly, there are civilians who are known as collaborators. They are not officially gang members, but they are responsible for helping the gang with small jobs, like obtaining intelligence, and moving or holding illicit goods. The 18th Street Gang also designates positions in their organizational structure in another way. In this structure, at the top are the leaders, known as the “toros,” meaning bull. Underneath each “toro” is a clica, which is led by a “homie.” Under each “homie” are the “soldados,” meaning soldiers. Outside of the prisons, Barrio 18 is organized into divisions based on territory called “canchas.” The gang is horizontal in structure, allowing for a more decentralized approach to things. Although, overall 18th Street Gang is not very organized compared to some other modern day gangs. Women were also able to join the gang, but were treated very poorly. The women that joined the gang had three ways to do so, first was an 18-second beating, second was sexual intercourse with multiple members, and the last option was being the girlfriend or wife of a member can potentially lead to membership over time. The women were expected to take on male-associated roles often involving violence, as well as playing more of a mother role by caring for children and taking care of the sick.

=== Culture ===
18th Street Gang members are required to abide by a strict set of rules. Failure to obey the word of a gang leader, or to show proper respect to a fellow gang member, may result in an 18-second beating, or even execution for more serious offenses. According to the FBI, some factions of the 18th Street Gang have developed a high level of sophistication and organization. 18th Street Gang members often identify themselves with the number 18 on their clothing and sporting clothing from sports teams such as the, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Rams, Los Angeles Chargers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Kings, and Las Vegas Raiders. 18th Street will use the symbols XV3, XVIII, X8, 666, 99, and 3-dots (Mi Vida Loca [My Crazy Life]) in their graffiti and tattoos. 18th Street colors are blue and black; blue is to represent and to pay tribute to The Mexican Mafia, and black is to represent the original color for the gang. The 18th Street Gang is occasionally referred to as the &quot;Children&#x27;s Army&quot; because of its recruitment of elementary and middle-school aged youth. They also allow other ethnicities to join their ranks making the gang multi-ethnic. In El Salvador it is common for members of the gang to be tattooed on the face with a large &quot;18&quot;. In many cases the tattoo covers the entire face.

In California, the majority of the 18th Street gang&#x27;s members are illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America.

Pete Wingfield&#x27;s 1975 single &quot;Eighteen With a Bullet&quot; is the official theme song of 18th Street.

== Criminal activity ==
The most lucrative activity of the 18th Street gang is street-level distribution of cocaine and marijuana, and to a lesser extent, heroin and methamphetamine. The gang is also involved in auto theft, carjacking, drive-by shootings, extortion, identification fraud, robbery, assault and homicide.

Special Agent George Rodriguez of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) described the 18th Street gang as &quot;one of the most violent street gangs and one of the most prolific in the United States&quot;. Cars are stolen and homes are burgled by the gang routinely. On average, someone in Los Angeles County is assaulted or robbed by 18th Streeters every day. The gang has left a bloody trail at a pace three times that of many of the city&#x27;s most active gangs. 18th Street is a well established gang that is involved in all areas of street-crime. Several 18th Street Gang members have reached a higher level of sophistication and organization in their illicit activities than other gangs. While their main source of income is street-level distribution of drugs, they also have been linked to murders, assaults, arson, copyright infringement, extortion, human trafficking, illegal immigration, kidnapping, prostitution, robbery, and weapons trafficking, as well as other crimes. 18th Street Gang has also been implicated in the high-profile kidnapping and murder of the 16-year-old brother of internationally renowned Honduran football player Wilson Palacios.

In 1998, Catarino Gonzalez was sentenced to life in prison after a jury convicted Gonzalez of first-degree murder for fatally shooting Officer Filbert Cuesta in the back of the head, while the officer was sitting in a patrol car.

Kingston, New York police arrested and jailed several young men on the charge that they abducted a victim, took him to nearby woods, and murdered him. They were held on federal murder and racketeering charges.

In 2019, an 18th Street gangster was fatally shot by a member of rival gang MS-13 in a Queens subway station.

In Guatemala City, many bus drivers have been killed by 18th Street Gang members that drove through the alleged territory of the gang. Bus drivers were often victims of robberies and extortion. In one particular case the bus owners refused to pay the gang; a few moments later, a young man, the son of one of Libertad&#x27;s bus owners, was driving his bus along Route 4, which ran from the terminal down to the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala in the southern part of the city. As he passed through Zone 6, two men flagged down the bus. They boarded it and shot the driver in the head killing him instantly.

<text>The &#x27; (; , ), also informally known as the Blue Max&quot;&quot;&#x27; () after German WWI flying ace Max Immelmann, is an extinct order of merit established in 1740 by King Frederick II of Prussia. The was awarded as both a military and civil honour and ranked, along with the Order of the Black Eagle, the Order of the Red Eagle and the House Order of Hohenzollern, among the highest orders of merit in the Kingdom of Prussia. The order of merit was the highest royal Prussian order of bravery for officers of all ranks.

The was awarded strictly as a recognition of extraordinary personal achievement, rather than as a general marker of social status or a courtesy-honour, although certain restrictions of social class and military rank were applied. The order was secular, and membership endured for the remaining lifetime of the recipient, unless renounced or revoked.

New awards of the military class ceased with the end of the Prussian monarchy in November 1918. German author Ernst Jünger, who died in 1998, was the last living recipient of the military class award.

A civil class for merits in sciences, humanities, and arts was established in 1842 by King Frederick William IV. The civil class was revived as an independent organization in 1923 (&quot; &quot;). Instead of the King of Prussia, the President of Germany acted as head of the order. After the Second World War, the civil class was re-established in 1952. This version of the &#x27; is still active today. The&#x27; is still an order into which a person is admitted into membership, like the United Kingdom&#x27;s Order of the British Empire, and is not simply a medal or state decoration.
== Military class ==
The was founded in 1740 by King Frederick II of Prussia. It was named in French, which was the leading international language and the favoured language at Frederick&#x27;s court. The French name was retained, despite the rising tide of nationalism and increasing hostility between the French and Germans during the 19th century, and indeed many of its recipients were honoured for acts performed in wars against France. The insignia of the military award was a blue-enameled Maltese Cross with golden eagles between the arms (which is based on the symbol of the Johanniter Order) and the Prussian royal cypher and the words (&quot;For Merit&quot; in French) written in gold letters on the body of the cross. The ribbon was black with edge stripes of silver-white. The order consisted of only one class, both civil and military, until 1810. Only a few civilians were honored: Pierre Louis Maupertuis (1747), Francesco Algarotti (1747) and Voltaire (1750).
In January 1810, during the Napoleonic wars, King Frederick William III decreed that the award could be presented only to serving military officers. In March 1813, the King added an additional distinction, a spray of gilt oak leaves attached above the cross. Award of the oak leaves originally indicated extraordinary achievement in battle, and was usually reserved for high-ranking officers.

The original regulations called for the capture or successful defence of a fortification, or victory in a battle. By World War I, the oak leaves often indicated a second or higher award of the , though in most cases the recipients were still high-ranking officers (usually distinguished field commanders fitting the criteria above; the few lower ranking recipients of the oak leaves were mainly general staff officers responsible for planning a victorious battle or campaign). In early 1918, it was proposed to award the oak leaves to Germany&#x27;s top flying ace, Manfred von Richthofen, but he was deemed ineligible under a strict reading of the regulations (he had already received his without oak leaves in January 1917). Instead of the oak leaves Prussia awarded von Richthofen a slightly less prestigious honor, the Order of the Red Eagle, 3rd Class with Crown and Swords. This was still a high honour, as the 3rd Class was normally awarded to colonels and lieutenant colonels and as a captain he would usually have received the 4th Class. Von Richthofen&#x27;s award of the 3rd Class with Crown and Swords was one of only two that was given during World War I.

In 1866, a special military &quot;Grand Cross&quot; class of the award was established. This grade of the award was given to those who, through their actions, caused the retreat or destruction of an army. There were only five recipients of the &quot;Grand Cross of the Pour le Mérite&quot;: King Wilhelm I in 1866, Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia (later Emperor Frederick III) and Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia in 1873, Tsar Alexander II of Russia in 1878, and Helmuth Graf von Moltke in 1879.

The gained international fame during World War I. Although it could be awarded to any military officer, its most famous recipients were the pilots of the German Army Air Service (Luftstreitkräfte), whose exploits were celebrated in wartime propaganda. In aerial warfare, a fighter pilot was initially entitled to the award upon downing eight enemy aircraft. Aces Max Immelmann and Oswald Boelcke were the first airmen to receive the award, on 12 January 1916. It was awarded to Germany&#x27;s highest-scoring ace, Manfred von Richthofen, in January 1917.

The number of aerial victories necessary to receive the award continued to increase during the war; by early 1917, it generally required destroying 16–20 enemy airplanes, and by war&#x27;s end the approximate figure was 30. However, other aviation recipients included zeppelin commanders, bomber and observation aircrews, and at least one balloon observer.

Recipients of the &quot;Blue Max&quot;, a nickname of the order, were required to wear the award whenever in uniform. Although many of its famous recipients were junior officers, especially pilots, more than a third of all awards in World War I went to generals and admirals. Senior officer awards tended to be more for outstanding leadership in combat than for individual acts of bravery.

Junior officers (army captains and lieutenants and their navy equivalents) accounted for only about a fourth of all awards. Several famous U-boat commanders, including Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière (), Walther Schwieger () Otto Hersing () and Otto Weddigen, received the .

The became extinct as a result of Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s abdication as king of Prussia and German Emperor on 9 November 1918. This marked the end of the Prussian monarchy and it was never awarded thereafter; however the honour continued to be recognized for, and worn by, previous recipients.

== Civil class ==

In 1842, King Frederick William IV of Prussia, appointed Alexander von Humboldt Chancellor of the Order of Merit

with powers to recommend candidates to this new civil class of the Order Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts (&quot;Orden Pour le Mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste&quot;), with the three sections: humanities, natural science and fine arts. When a vacancy occurred the Academy of Arts and Sciences nominated three candidates, one of whom the king appointed.

In November 1918 the Kingdom of Prussia came to an end, and with it that state&#x27;s sponsorship of the . However, unlike the military class of the order, the class of the order for achievements in the arts and sciences did not come to an end. The members re-established their order as an autonomous organization, with revised rules and processes for nomination.

The awarding of new memberships resumed in 1923. Recipients included Albert Einstein (1923), Käthe Kollwitz (1929) and Ernst Barlach (1933).

During the era of National Socialism in Germany (1933–45), the order was re-absorbed into the state honours system, and the list of its members was reviewed and revised according to the policies of the new government. A number of Jews and other perceived dissidents or &quot;enemies&quot; of the state were deprived of their awards by the Nazi regime. They included Einstein (who resigned his membership in the order in 1933, and refused invitations to renew it after the war), Kollwitz, and Barlach. Such actions were later repudiated by both the order and the postwar German government.

In 1952, the order was re-established again in West Germany with assistance of Federal President Theodor Heuss – now as an independent organization with state recognition and the President of the German Federal Republic as Protector of the Order. However, unlike the somewhat similar Bundesverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit), also established by Heuss, it is not a state order.

The revived civil order of the is awarded for achievements in the arts and sciences. Active membership is limited to 40 German citizens, ten each in the fields of humanities, natural science, and medicine and the arts. Honorary membership can be conferred on foreigners, again to the limit of 40. When a vacancy occurs, the remaining members select a new inductee.

=== Notable recipients of the civil class ===

=== Similar orders in other countries ===
Besides Prussia, several other states of the former German Empire also conferred similar awards for the arts and sciences. These included the Kingdom of Bavaria&#x27;s Maximilian Order for Art and Science (&quot;Maximiliansorden für Kunst und Wissenschaft&quot;), the Duchy of Anhalt&#x27;s Order of Merit for Science and Art (&quot;Verdienstorden für Wissenschaft und Kunst&quot;), and the Principality of Lippe&#x27;s Lippe Rose Order for Art and Science (&quot;Lippische Rose, Orden für Kunst und Wissenschaft&quot;).

A number of other countries have founded similar high civic honours for accomplishments in the arts and sciences. The sovereign of the Commonwealth realms confers the Order of Merit and Order of the Companions of Honour. The Republic of Austria confers the Austrian Decoration of Honour for Science and the Arts, founded in 1955. Like the Order Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts, this was in a sense a revival of an earlier imperial award, in this case the Austro-Hungarian Decoration of Honour for Art and Science (&quot;Österreichisch-Ungarisches Ehrenzeichen für Kunst und Wissenschaft&quot;), which existed from 1887 to 1918. Unlike the German award, the design of the modern Austrian award is unlike that of its imperial predecessor. France has the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for significant contributions to the arts and literature. In Poland the Gloria Artis Medal has been established for the same purpose.

Other countries also may recognise accomplishments in the arts and sciences, but with more general orders also awarded for accomplishments in other fields. France&#x27;s Légion d&#x27;honneur is an example of a decoration often conferred for accomplishment in many fields, including the arts and sciences. Belgium awards either its Order of Leopold or Order of the Crown for outstanding accomplishments in the arts and sciences, and may award its Civil Decoration for lesser accomplishments in these fields.

<doc id="293719" wikidata="Q623424" url="?curid=293719" title="Great St Bernard Pass">
<text>The Great St Bernard Pass (, , ; ) is the third highest road pass in Switzerland, at an elevation of . It connects Martigny in the canton of Valais in Switzerland with Aosta in the region Aosta Valley in Italy. It is the lowest pass lying on the ridge between the two highest mountains of the Alps, Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa. It is located on the main watershed that separates the basin of the Rhône from that of the Po.

Great St Bernard is one of the most ancient passes through the Western Alps, with evidence of use as far back as the Bronze Age and surviving traces of a Roman road. In 1800, Napoleon&#x27;s army used the pass to enter Italy, an event depicted in Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s &quot;Napoleon at the Saint-Bernard Pass&quot; and Paul Delaroche&#x27;s &quot;Bonaparte Crossing the Alps&quot;, both notable oil paintings. Having been bypassed by easier and more practical routes, particularly the Great St Bernard Tunnel, a road tunnel which opened in 1964, its value today is mainly historical and recreational.

Straddling the highest point of the road, the Great St Bernard Hospice was founded in 1049. The hospice later became famous for its use of St. Bernard dogs in rescue operations. The Italian side of the area includes several facilities as well. Between them is the small Great St Bernard Lake.

==Geography==
The Great St Bernard Pass is located near the western end of the Valais Alps, the next pass to the west, Col Ferret, marking the transition with the Mont Blanc massif. In that area, between Mont Dolent and Mont Vélan, the main crest of the Alps barely reaches 3,000 metres, unlike in the much higher section of the Valais Alps east of Mont Vélan and Grand Combin. Therefore, the Great St Bernard Pass is one of the only two road axis connecting Valais with northern Italy, the other axis being the Simplon Pass.

===Route===
The pass runs northwest–southeast through the Valais Alps (formerly known as the Pennine Alps after the Roman name for the pass, &quot;poeninus mons&quot; or &quot;summus poeninus&quot;) at a maximum elevation of . The road running through the pass, highway E27 in both Italy and Switzerland, joins Martigny on the upper Rhône in the canton of Valais, Switzerland, to Aosta in the Aosta Valley region of Italy. From Martigny Route 9 descends to Lausanne and from Aosta Route A5 descends to Torino.
From the north, in Switzerland, the route to the pass follows the lower part of the river Drance above Martigny, then into the sparsely populated Val d&#x27;Entremont (lit.: &quot;valley between mountain&quot;) through which the Drance d&#x27;Entremont flows. After having passed the last inhabited locality, Bourg-Saint-Pierre, the road runs above a large reservoir, the Lac des Toules. At the location of Bourg-Saint-Bernard, the Great St Bernard Tunnel (and the main road) plunges through the mountains at a level, reducing, since the tunnel&#x27;s opening in 1964, the commercial relevance of the road over the pass. The summit section of the road consists of hairpin turns before it reaches the top of the pass, after having passed the Combe des Morts.

On the south side the route descends a few metres and reaches the shores of the lake before its enters Italy. Then the route follows the steep slopes of the upper part of the &quot;torrent du Grand Saint-Bernard&quot; to the south, then turns to the east and follows the river in a bend to the south, where the mountain river enters the torrent Artanavaz near Saint-Rhémy-en-Bosses and turns to the east again, then smoothly to the southeast at La Clusaz (Gignod). Here the river enters the Buthier river in the lower end of the Valpelline valley and turns south again on which end finally the river flows into the Dora Baltea near the Pont de Pierre in Aosta. The route here in the main valley of the Val d&#x27;Aoste becomes part of the A5 motorway connecting the Mont Blanc Tunnel to the west and the upper Po Basin to the southeast.
A reduction of utility began after the construction of the Simplon Tunnel, strictly a railway tunnel, to the east in 1905. The much smaller historic road winding over the pass itself, which lies a few hundred metres from the Swiss border with Italy, is only passable June to September.

The pass at narrowest point runs between the peaks of Grande Chenalette at and Mont Mort at . Slightly to the west is Pointe de Drône at , the highest peak. Between it and the pass is Petite Chenalette at .

The Tour de France has visited the pass five times. It was climbed four times as a 1st category climb, and one time, in 2009, as a hors catégorie climb.

===Climate===
The snow in the pass in winter may be as much as 10 metres deep. The temperature may drop as low as -30 °C. The lake in the pass is frozen for 265 days per year. A summary of weather data for the year 1991-2020 is given below.

===Ecology===
The pass is well above the tree line. All the wood required for construction and firewood must be hauled in from some distance. On the south-west side of the pass is a small tarn, the Great St Bernard Lake, which captures melt water and does not support fish, even though attempts have been made to stock it. In past years the tarn has not always thawed completely in summer.

Alpine flowers are abundant in the vicinity: Gentiana clusii, Ranunculus glacialis, Dryas octopetala, Forget-me-not, Saxifraga oppositifolia among many hundreds more. Moss is prolific and the rocks are lichen-covered.

==The hospice and the dogs==

A hospice for travellers was founded in 1049 by Saint Bernard of Menthon and came to be named after him in the 16th century, along with the pass. It was not the first hospice in the pass. Buildings were probably there since the Roman times, but the region was not secure and they were destroyed many times. The first concern of the founder of the current monastery was to clear the region of bandits and keep the pass safe for travellers, the role of rescuers developing naturally. The hospice later became famous for its use of St Bernard dogs in rescue operations. Pope Pius XI confirmed Bernard as patron saint of the Alps in 1923.

The hospice straddles the highest point of the road, which is in Switzerland. Today the modern road for through traffic has been routed around the outside of the monastery buildings to allow some integrity of the grounds. The old road may still be seen, above the paved road. The hospice occupies two buildings, of 1560 and 1898 (&quot;picture, above&quot;). The Congregation of Canons of the Great Saint Bernard (the monks) also owns the Hôtel de l&#x27;Hospice du Grand-St-Bernard, a four-storey building made of grey stone (built in 1899) on the Italian side, which it leases to a private entrepreneur for the provision of hotel services.

The St Bernards were bred large enough to traverse deep snow and to find lost persons by scent. The first evidence that the dogs were in use at the monastery is two paintings dating to 1690 by Salvator Rosa. It is often said that they carried small casks of brandy around their necks (although this is only legend), in the belief that the liquor had medicinal properties.
A description of an overnight stay at the monastery in 1857 was given by Theodore Nielsen, a Danish kleinsmith journeyman, in his memoirs: 

Today the tunnel and modern technology have made rescue operations at the pass mainly unnecessary. The dogs were put up for sale in 2004 because of the high cost of maintenance and were promptly bought by two foundations created for the purpose: Fondation Barry du Grand Saint Bernard (major contributor Christine Cerletti-Sarasin) and Fondation Bernard et Caroline de Watteville. Barry bought the kennels and the facilities in Martigny and continues to support and breed the dogs (three or four dozen). One condition of the sale is that they be brought to the monastery for the summer. Travellers are likely to see them romping around the slopes. The de Watteville Foundation keeps several dogs in kennels adjunct to its Musée. Both have agreed to work together and others have joined the partnership.

The monastery currently houses a handful of monks on a permanent basis, and serves as a spiritual centre for others on retreat.

==History==

===Celtic period===
The pass first appears in history as the route taken by the Celtic tribes of the Boii and Lingones in the invasion of Italy of 390 BC. The classical authors first mentioning the pass in that or other contexts lived the 1st century BC under the early Roman Empire. They were calling the pass and the mountains &quot;Poeninus&quot; or &quot;Poenini&quot;, &quot;Punic&quot;, an apparent reference to Hannibal&#x27;s crossing. He did not cross there, however. On the presumption that the name was falsely altered by analogy, it can be reconstructed to *peninus, a Roman-Celtic word, considering that Celtic tribes owned the entire pass until defeated by the Romans. Livy says that the pass was not named after the Carthaginians but after a mountain god. For well over a century scholars such as the Grimm brothers have made a connection with continental Celtic &quot;pen&quot; or &quot;ben&quot;, &quot;head, summit, chief&quot; on an analogy with the &quot;Zeus karaios&quot; of Hesychius.

Two tribes occupied the valleys on either side of the pass on a permanent basis: the Veragri on the Swiss side and the Salassi on the Italian side.

===Roman period===
Julius Caesar sent an expedition under his best commander, Servius Galba, from Gaul in 57 BC to seize the pass, hoping to obtain a shorter route between Italy and Gaul than the contemporaneous coastal route. Galba was deceived by the Veragri into making camp near Martigny with the expectation of moving into the pass on the next day. At that time the Romans found the heights over the trail occupied by three hostile Gallic tribes. The Romans won a local victory by a daring foray from the camp but Galba judged he could not take the pass and departed.

Augustus succeeded where his adoptive father failed and the pass became Roman. Augustus placed a large &quot;castra stativa&quot; and colony, &quot;Augusta Praetoria Salassorum&quot;, below the pass, which became Aosta (contraction of Augusta). Its ruins are a historic attraction there. By 43 AD under the emperor Claudius a good Roman road through the pass was completed with a mansio at the top and a temple to &quot;Jupiter Poeninus&quot;, resulting in the name &quot;Mons Jovis&quot; in late antiquity, &quot;Monte Jove&quot; in the early Italian period and &quot;Mont Joux&quot; in the French period, a synonym for the pass. The site of the temple is known as the Plan de Jupiter, located on a knoll on the Italian side of the pass. A cross was placed there in 1816 bearing the inscription &quot;Deo optimo maximo&quot;, &quot;to the best and greatest god.&quot; The bronze statue of St Bernard on a pedestal above the road on the Italian side, across a small valley from the cross, was constructed in 1905 on the site of the Roman &quot;mansio&quot;.

The coins and votive tablets found at the site of the temple roughly date the upper limit of Roman control of the pass. The youngest date to the reign of Theodosius II (1st half of the 5th century). These and other artifacts are stored in the monastery museum. Fragments of the marble temple, some with inscriptions, have been incorporated into many structures of the village of Bourg-Saint-Pierre on the Swiss side of the pass. The Roman milestone for mile XXIIII was also brought to the center of the settlement from the top of the pass.

===Napoleonic crossing===

The pass had entered history with the Gallic invasion of 390 BC. The last Gallic invasion over it occurred in May, 1800, under the direction of the 30-year-old First Consul of the French Republic, Napoleon Bonaparte. An Austrian army of 140,000 men had laid siege to French-occupied Genoa on the west coast of northern Italy. Napoleon traversed the pass with 40,000 men and ⅓ of their heavy artillery, sending another 20,000 over three other passes as a diversion, intending to strike the Austrian rear. The panicked Austrians were unable to assemble fast enough to meet the French en masse but rather in a piecemeal way in June 1800, and so were defeated first at the Battle of Montebello and then at the Battle of Marengo.

Napoleon prepared for the march secretly by assembling men in small units below the pass, establishing supply dumps along the lower part of their route, and hiring artisans to set up shop along it as well. On May 15 an advance unit went over the pass to take Aosta, after which hospitals were set up at Martigny and Aosta. At Martigny the army assembled and received rations for three days. All the equipment - carriages, artillery, arms and ammunition - was disassembled and divided into packs of 60-70 pounds for the men to carry. The cannons were to be dragged up over the snow in hollowed-out pine half-logs by mules, and then when the mules died or were exhausted, by 100 soldiers and hired men each. Napoleon offered liberal monetary rewards to soldiers and laborers who could perform difficult portages in a timely fashion.
Over several days at the end of May the army went over the pass single-file, 6000 men per day. Bands played martial music along the route, with drum rolls at especially difficult places to alert the men. At the top the monks handed each man two glasses of wine and a slice of rye with cheese as they filed by (courtesy of the French army). Accounts of the amounts expended vary. On the other side the snow became so packed that the men slid down sitting. Napoleon was the last man over, sliding also. The good weather held for the entire crossing, otherwise the crossing could have easily become disastrous.

On the way up Napoleon had discussed affairs of the heart with his young guide and mule driver, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who did not know his identity. Offered a reward at the top, Dorsaz asked for the mule on which Napoleon was riding. He received the mule and a short note for the chief supply officer of the army. Versions of the story vary, but they all agree that when the young man had turned in the note and had drawn his ample pay for the work, he found that his companion was Napoleon and the latter had given him a house and farm so that he could marry his sweetheart.

In the Aosta Valley Napoleon&#x27;s army slipped by an Austrian garrison at Bard just out of cannon range. The commander related that he was astonished to watch an army of 40,000 men in full equipment go marching past from the direction of the heights.

==In literature==
The Dorrit family crossed from France into Italy in Book Two: Riches of the novel &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; by Charles Dickens. They meet the newly-wed Gowans and the gentlemanly murderer Rigaud, now called Blandois, at the inn after climbing up on mules. The novel was published in 1857, but set in the mid 1820s. Dickens describes the sites of the pass, and the experience of staying overnight in the inn, having visited it in person.

<text>Sympathy for the Record Industry (also known as Sympathy Records or Sympathy 4 the R.I.) is a mainly independent garage rock and punk label formed in 1988 by John Mermis, known as Long Gone John. Notable artists who started on Sympathy and went on to gain mainstream success include The White Stripes, Hole, and The Electrocutes (the first Donnas incarnation).

==History==
Long Gone John is the owner and CEO. He is an avid record collector with more than 10,100 records in his collection. He also owns Necessaries Toy Foundation, a company that creates 18-24 inch figures. Long Gone John also operates Sympathetic Press, a book publishing company that prints books with rock and roll themes.

The first Sympathy release was the Lazy Cowgirls&#x27; &quot;Radio Cowgirl&quot; LP, which Long Gone John said he released as a &quot;favor to the band.&quot; Sympathy has a catalog of more than 750 releases. The label&#x27;s name is a play on the song &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; by The Rolling Stones.

The roster has included Jack Off Jill, Scarling, Miss Derringer, The Muffs, Mumps, The (International) Noise Conspiracy, The Von Bondies, Rocket from the Crypt, Billy Childish, Turbonegro, April March, Splatterheads, The Dwarves, Suicide, The Gun Club, Inger Lorre and Motel Shootout, Man or Astro-man?, The Red Planet Rocketts, Kim Salmon, Bored!, The Waldos, The Mystreated, and Redd Kross.

On July 20, 2007, Long Gone John announced via his Myspace Blog that he was selling the label for &quot;$625,000.00 or $700,000.00 if I don&#x27;t like you.&quot;

In September 2011, John decided to start releasing records once again. He signed a distribution deal with Independent Label Distribution, then immediately put out a full-length LP as well as three 7-inches by The Ettes. The company now distributes new records as well as many older ones from John&#x27;s catalog.

As of 2023, the label&#x27;s website has been updated with a notice that states &quot;Hope to get the rest off the catalog up and available soon…&quot;. Sympathy has continued to add releases in the early 2020s.

<text>Takrur, Tekrur or Tekrour ( 500 – c. 1456) was a state based in the Senegal River valley in modern day Mauritania and Northern Senegal which was at its height in the 11th and 12th centuries, roughly parallel to the Ghana Empire. It lasted in some form into the 18th century.

==History==
===Origin===
There are a number of conflicting theories about the deep past of the Senegal river valley, where the Kingdom of Takrur would take root. The formation of the state may have taken place as an influx of Fulani from the east settled in the Senegal valley. John Donnelly Fage suggests that Takrur was formed through the interaction of Berbers from the Sahara and &quot;Negro agricultural peoples&quot; who were &quot;essentially Serer&quot;. The outsiders may, however, have been Soninke rather than Berber, and the native population may have already spoken Fula. Regardless, the region has been an ethnic melting pot from the earliest traceable periods up to the present, although Fula have come to dominate in more recent centuries.

The founding dynasty was called Dya&#x27;ogo. Traditional historians disagree on their origin and ethnic background (assuming a relationship can be drawn at all with ethnic labels as understood today). They were blacksmith-kings, and supposedly introduced iron-working and ore extraction to the region. 

===Manna Dynasty===
A Soninke clan under Mamadu Sumaare, originally from Wagadu, conquered Takrur in the 9th or 10th century, establishing the Manna dynasty and gradually melding into the local culture. They may have been Nyakhates from Diarra, Soumares from Guidimakha, or Jaabis.

Takrur was first mentioned in Arab sources in the 10th century. In 1035 king War Jabi introduced Sharia law, becoming the first ruler to officially adopt Islamic orthodoxy in the Sahel. During his reign he launched a Holy War against the King of Silla, subjugating them and converting the people to Islam. He died in 1041 and was succeeded by his son, Lebi ibn War Jabi, who would go on to start an alliance with the newly established Almoravid Dynasty to counter the power of the Ghana Empire. The first action between this alliance came in 1054 with a combined attack on the berber city of Awdaghust, for recognizing the authority of the ruler of Ghana. Having fought alongside Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni at the battle of Tabfarilla, Lebi also provided military help, and financial aid to the Almoravids, helping conquer up to Morocco and Al-Andalus. 4,000 cavalrymen from Takrur were critical to the Almoravid victory at the 1086 Battle of Sagrajas in Al-Andalus which was crucial to halting the Reconquista. This alliance was maintained for most of the next 200 years.

During this period Takrur held a dominant position in regional trade, controlling a series of trading posts and cities linking the salt mines of Awlil on the coast north of the mouth of the Senegal to the interior. In the 12th century, Silla, allied with Takrur, went to war against Wagadu. Its decline meant that Takrur was able to exert more control over the trade routes moving gold from Bambouk to desert-side markets. 

===Serer Exodus===
When Islam and Sharia was introduced to the Kingdom by the Manna, it led to the persecution of local animists. The lamanic class, whose role also included the safeguarding of traditional Serer spirituality, are believed to have been at the forefront of resisting Islamization, partly to preserve their religion, but also their power and wealth as landowners. It was common for early Arab writers such as Al Bakri to refer to &quot;non-believers&quot; of Islam in their works as &quot;lamlam, lemlem,&quot; or &quot;damdam&quot; which may be a corruption of the Serer title &quot;lamaan.&quot; During the 13th century, a civil war broke out. Rather than convert, the Serer migrated southwest first to the Ferlo and then to Siin and Saloum. This was the process by which a distinct &#x27;Serer&#x27; identity first emerged, separate from the rest of the Takruri population.

===Vassalage and Decline===
The 13th century was a period of political crisis in Takrur. The last Manna king, Cengaan Sumaare, is remembered as a bloodthirsty tyrant who was overthrown by his own people. The western parts of the kingdom became independent. Around 1286, the Mali Empire conquered Takrur and put it under a military dictatorship ruled by &quot;farba&quot; (governors), remembered locally as the Tonjon dynasty. Mali&#x27;s power in the region diminished in the 14th century, however, and the Fula Lam Termess and Lam Taaga dynasties were able to take power. The region may also have been controlled by the Kingdom of Diarra.

Takrur was conquered by the Jolof emperor Tyukuli N&#x27;Diklam in the 15th century, who split the region between multiple &quot;farba&quot;. By 1506, however, the &quot;Burba&quot;&#x27;s authority was weakening, and the &quot;farba&quot; fell to fighting amongst themselves. Koli Tengella, a Fula warlord native to Takrur but coming from Futa Jallon, conquered the area in 1521 and set up the Denanke dynasty. This would last until 1776 when the Fouta Revolution, led by Muslim clerics, took over the kingdom and the house of Denanke was brought down.

===Timeline===
Dates are approximate and often disputed by different sources or authors.
==Economy==
Takrur was a trading centre, where gold from the Bambuk region, salt from the Awlil, and Sahel grain were exchanged for wool, copper, beads, and jewelry. The kingdom&#x27;s cotton cloth was among its most renowned exports.

==Territory==
At the height of its power, Takrur controlled the north bank of the Senegal as far as the Tagant plateau and Aleg. The Gorgol river valley was the heartland of the kingdom, and was the site of the Dya&#x27;ogo capital Tumbere Jiinge. They also controlled, or at least had significant influence over, the area downstream that would become Waalo.

==Takrur as a toponym==
Takruri was a term, like Bilad el-Sudan, that was used to refer to all people of West African ancestry, and is still in use as such in the Middle East, with some corruption, as in &quot;Takruni&quot;, pl. &quot;Takarna&quot; تكروني in Saudi Arabia, and in Ethiopia and Eritrea, in the form Tukrir. The district of &quot;Bulaq Al-Dakrur&quot; بولاق الدكرور in Cairo is named after an ascetic from West Africa. In the Middle East Toucouleurs are still referred to as &quot;Tukrir&quot; to this day.

Takrur was the term used by the region&#x27;s inhabitants up until the 15th century. During the 16th and 17th centuries, however, it was gradually replaced by Futa Toro.
