<text>The films listed below have been cited by a variety of notable critics in varying media sources as being among the worst films ever made. Examples of such sources include Metacritic, Roger Ebert&#x27;s list of most-hated films, &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot;, &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot;, Rotten Tomatoes, pop culture writer Nathan Rabin&#x27;s &quot;My World of Flops&quot;, the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the cult TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (alongside spinoffs &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot;, &quot;The Film Crew&quot; and &quot;RiffTrax&quot;), and the Golden Raspberry Awards (aka the &quot;Razzies&quot;). Films on these lists are generally feature-length films that are commercial/artistic in nature (intended to turn a profit, express personal statements or both), professionally or independently produced (as opposed to amateur productions, such as home movies), and released in theaters, then on home video.

== 1930s ==

=== &quot;Maniac&quot; (1934) ===
&quot;Maniac&quot;, also known as &quot;Sex Maniac&quot;, is a pre-Code exploitation-horror film directed by Dwain Esper. The story is a loose adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe story &quot;The Black Cat&quot; and follows a vaudeville impersonator who becomes an assistant to a mad scientist. Promoted as a documentary on mental illness, &quot;Maniac&quot; was criticized for its gratuitous footage of women undressing and for plagiarizing horror sequences from the 1922 silent film &quot;Häxan&quot;. Danny Peary believes that &quot;Maniac&quot; is the worst film ever made, and Charlie Jane Anders of Gawker Media″s io9 described it as &quot;possibly the worst movie in history.&quot; Rotten Tomatoes placed &quot;Maniac&quot; on its list of movies &quot;So Bad They&#x27;re Unmissable&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; included the film on its list of the 20 worst movies ever and it is featured in John J. B. Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood&#x27;s Worst&quot;.

=== &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; (1936) ===
&quot;Reefer Madness&quot; (originally released as &quot;Tell Your Children&quot; and sometimes titled or subtitled as &quot;The Burning Question&quot;, &quot;Dope Addict&quot;, &quot;Doped Youth&quot;, and &quot;Love Madness&quot;) is a 1936 American exploitation film and propaganda work revolving around the melodramatic events that ensue when high school students are lured by pushers to smoke cannabis— and consequently become addicted and involved in various crimes such as a hit and run accident, manslaughter, murder, attempted rape, and descent into madness, association with organized crime and suicide.

&quot;Pacific Standard&quot; wrote that &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; was &quot;one of the first films ever to be considered transcendentally bad&quot; and Leonard Maltin has called it &quot;the grand-daddy of all &#x27;Worst&#x27; movies&quot;. &quot;Las Vegas CityLife&quot; named it the &quot;worst ever&quot; runner-up to &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, and News.com.au considered it a &quot;disastrous flop turned cult classic&quot; due to its &quot;terrible acting and exaggerated drug-addicted stereotypes&quot;. Natalli Amato of &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; included &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; on her list of the best worst movies, writing that it &quot;may be one of the worst movies of all time for the fact that it accomplished the exact opposite of its intended goal&quot; by becoming a cult classic among stoners. &quot;Leafly&quot;″s Danté Jordan also wrote that it may be &quot;the worst movie of all time&quot;, criticizing its many inaccuracies regarding marijuana use and calling it &quot;easily one of the most uncreative and tone-deaf pieces of anti-cannabis propaganda&quot;.

=== &quot;The Terror of Tiny Town&quot; (1938) ===

&quot;The Terror of Tiny Town&quot;, directed by Sam Newfield and produced by Jed Buell, remains the only musical Western with an all-dwarf cast. The film was pulled from obscurity as a camp classic after appearing in college and midnight screenings in the early 1970s. In 1978, it was included in Michael Medved&#x27;s book, &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;, and has since been listed as one of the worst films ever made, by &quot;Flavorwire&quot;, Rotten Tomatoes, and &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot;. Melvin Defleur referred to it as &quot;Perhaps the worst film of all time&quot;, and critic Gabriel Ricard listed it as the worst film ever made; stating, &quot;not only is it pretty terrible, but &quot;Tiny Town&quot; is also pretty endearing.&quot; In 1986, &quot;The Terror of Tiny Town&quot; was the first film featured on &quot;Canned Film Festival&quot;, a late night television show featuring the worst movies ever made.

== 1940s ==

=== &quot;The Babe Ruth Story&quot; (1948) ===
&quot;The Babe Ruth Story&quot; is a 1948 baseball film biography of Babe Ruth, starring William Bendix, Claire Trevor and Sam Levene. &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes it as &quot;the &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; of baseball biopics&quot;. It was rushed into release while Ruth was still alive. One infamous scene features Ruth promising a dying child that he will hit two home runs. The child is subsequently cured of his ailments after Ruth delivers on the promise.

Baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams believed it to be the worst movie he had ever seen. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; stated that it &quot;stands as possibly the worst movie ever made&quot;. &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; included the film on its list of the worst films of all time, while Paul Newberry of the &quot;Associated Press&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s place on &quot;nearly every list of the worst movies ever made&quot; was &quot;with good reason&quot;. &quot;Newsday&quot;″s Jack Mathews similarly wrote that &quot;The Babe Ruth Story&quot; was &quot;what many people consider to be the worst sports movie of all time&quot;. It also was called one of the worst sports films ever each by &quot;Newsday&quot; and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, and called one of the worst biopics by Moviefone and Spike. Entertainment writer Michael Sauter included the film in his book, &quot;The Worst Movies of All Time&quot;, and Leonard Maltin called it &quot;perfectly dreadful&quot;.

=== &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot; (1948) ===

&quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot;, a British gangster film adapted from the 1939 novel by James Hadley Chase, received a very hostile reception from the press. This was mainly due to the film&#x27;s high (for the time) level of sexual and violent content, but also because its attempt to portray Americans using a largely British cast (including an early role for Sid James) was seen as unconvincing.

The British film journal &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;the most sickening exhibition of brutality, perversion, sex and sadism ever to be shown on a cinema screen&quot;. The &quot;Sunday Express&quot; film reviewer called &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot; &quot;the worst film I have ever seen&quot;. The Australian newspaper &quot;The Age&quot; also gave a harsh review: &quot;&quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot; is not only a disgrace to the studio that made it, but it also reflects on the British industry as a whole ... the entire production is unpardonable.&quot;

Cliff Goodwin, discussing &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot;″s initial reception, notes it was &quot;unanimously dubbed &#x27;the worst film ever made. Later reviews of the film were equally antipathetic. &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot; was described by British film reviewer Leslie Halliwell as a &quot;hilariously awful gangster film ... one of the worst films ever made&quot;. &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Classic Movie Guide&quot; states that &quot;No Orchids for Miss Blandish&quot; &quot;aspires to be a Hollywood film noir and misses by a mile.&quot;

== 1950s ==

=== &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; (1953) ===
&quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; starred Ed Wood as Glen, a transvestite who cross-dresses as Glenda. Wood also directed the film. After a dream sequence, Glen undergoes psychotherapy to help &quot;cure&quot; him of his transvestism.

Leonard Maltin wrote that &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; was worse than Wood&#x27;s later &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; and considered it &quot;possibly the worst movie ever made&quot;. Julien Allen of &quot;Reverse Shot&quot; similarly wrote that it was &quot;widely considered to be an atrocity&quot; and &quot;the most catastrophic failure of [Wood&#x27;s] singularly bad career&quot;. Richard Barrios described &quot;Glen or Glenda&quot; as &quot;one of the funniest and worst movies ever made&quot;.

=== &quot;Robot Monster&quot; (1953) ===

&quot;Robot Monster&quot; is a science-fiction film produced and directed by Phil Tucker and originally shot and exhibited in 3D. Its title character, which is &quot;a man in a gorilla suit wearing what looks like a diving helmet sprouting TV antennae&quot;, was given the Most Ridiculous Monster in Screen History award in &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot;. It is also featured in &quot;The Book of Lists&quot;″ 10 worst movies list, &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot; and Michael Sauter&#x27;s book &quot;The Worst Movies of All Time&quot;. &quot;Robot Monster&quot; was featured in an episode of the movie-mocking TV show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, as well as &quot;Canned Film Festival&quot;. The film is remembered fondly by horror novelist Stephen King, who quotes, and agrees with, a review in &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot; magazine (&quot;certainly among the finest terrible movies ever made&quot;, &quot;one of the most laughable poverty row quickies&quot;). Chris Barsanti in &quot;The Sci-Fi Movie Guide&quot; writes: &quot;[&quot;Robot Monster&quot;] gives &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; a run as the worst movie of all time.&quot;

=== &quot;The Conqueror&quot; (1956) ===
Howard Hughes funded &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, an epic film featuring John Wayne as Mongolian chieftain Genghis Khan and the redheaded Susan Hayward as a Tatar princess. The movie was filmed near St. George, Utah, downwind from a nuclear testing range in Nevada, and is often blamed for the cancer deaths of many of the cast and crew, including Hayward, Wayne, Agnes Moorehead, Pedro Armendáriz, and director Dick Powell. In addition to filming near the testing range, truckloads of the red sands were transported back to the studios for interior scenes and by 1980, 91 of the 220 (over 41%) cast and crew members had been diagnosed with cancer.

The film made the ten-worst list in &quot;The Book of Lists&quot;, appears in Michael Sauter&#x27;s &quot;The Worst Movies of All Time&quot;, and was among those listed in &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;. Additionally, the &quot;Aldergrove Star&quot; described &quot;The Conqueror&quot; as the worst ever made and &quot;Complex&quot; listed it as the worst biopic ever made. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the choice of Wayne for Khan – a role originally written for Marlon Brando – &quot;one of the worst casting decisions of all time&quot;. Wayne lamented taking the role, stating, &quot;Don&#x27;t make an ass of yourself trying to play parts you are not suited for.&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; writes: &quot;by absolutely every conceivable metric – financially, critically, historically, ethnically, and even body count – it would come to be known as one of the biggest disasters in cinematic history.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the film as the worst decision in movie history.

Hughes, one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest people at the time, had previously produced the successful dramatic films &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Scarface&quot;, and &quot;The Outlaw&quot;. After viewing &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, Hughes bought every existing print for $12 million and refused to let the film be seen on TV until 1974, reportedly out of guilt over the decision to shoot at such a hazardous location. This was the last film Hughes produced.

=== &quot;Fire Maidens from Outer Space&quot; (1956) ===

&quot;Fire Maidens from Outer Space&quot;, a low-budget British space opera film (known in the US as &quot;Fire Maidens of Outer Space&quot;), is about a group of astronauts visiting an all-female society on a moon of Jupiter. This film developed a negative reputation for its poor special effects (including a scene on the alien planet in which an automobile is visible driving past). Leslie Halliwell described &quot;Fire Maidens from Outer Space&quot; as &quot;a strong contender for the title of the worst movie ever made, with diaphanously clad English gals striking embarrassed poses against cardboard sets&quot;. British film historian I.Q. Hunter included it in his list of candidates for &quot;the worst British film ever made&quot;. The DVD Talk website&#x27;s review claimed it &quot;may be among the worst-ever professionally produced science fiction films&quot;. Paul Welsh of the &quot;Borehamwood &amp; Elstree Times&quot; wrote that it was &quot;probably the worst [film] ever produced&quot;. In his book &quot;Operation Hollywood: How the Pentagon Shapes and Censors the Movies&quot;, David L. Robb wrote that the film&#x27;s director Cy Roth is &quot;widely regarded as one of the worst filmmakers of all time&quot;, adding that, out of the three films he made, &quot;the worst was &quot;Fire Maidens from Outer Space&quot;...which is often cited as one of the ten worst movies ever made&quot;.

=== &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; (1957) ===
Ed Wood&#x27;s &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, a science fiction film about aliens resurrecting the dead, was labeled the &quot;Worst Film Ever&quot; by &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot; in 1980. Wood shot only a small amount of unrelated footage featuring top-billed star Bela Lugosi before his death. Wood incorporated the footage into the film and cast Tom Mason as Lugosi&#x27;s stand-in; Mason, a personal acquaintance of Wood, bore little resemblance to Lugosi and played his scenes holding the character&#x27;s cape in front of his face. Although &quot;Golden Turkey Awards&quot; author Michael Medved credits Lugosi&#x27;s top billing with its enduring legacy, &quot;The Independent&quot; listed various other shortcomings: &quot;A UFO dangling in the sky has been variously said to be either a car hubcap or a paper plate. Actors read from scripts on their lap; sound microphones wobble in and out of shot. Fake trees and cemetery headstones wobble as the actors brush past them. Characters go into scenes when it&#x27;s night time and leave five minutes later into daylight. ... the plot itself appears to be the product of insanity.&quot;

Emanuel Levy notes the film has been dubbed &quot;the epitome of so-bad-it&#x27;s-good cinema&quot; and has gained a cult following since appearing in &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot;. &quot;My Year of Flops&quot; author Nathan Rabin wrote that: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to overstate the role &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; and its eccentric creator have played in the birth and evolution of bad movie culture... &quot;Plan 9&quot; was the original best worst movie.&quot; BBC writer Nicholas Barber wrote that &quot;it stands as the epitome of cinematic awfulness. And that&#x27;s why so many people love it.&quot; Glenn Kenny of &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; and &quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; each described it as the worst movie ever made, and IGN wrote: &quot;&quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; was the undisputed best worst movie ever made for decades until films like &quot;Troll 2&quot; and &quot;The Room&quot; got notorious, and it&#x27;s still a legitimate contender&quot;.

It holds a 66% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 38 reviews, with the consensus stating that it is &quot;justly celebrated for its staggering ineptitude&quot;. Phil Hall of &quot;Film Threat&quot; contends that the film is &quot;far too entertaining to be considered as the very worst film ever made&quot;, and Kim Newman states that, &quot;The worst thing you can say about a film is that it&#x27;s boring, and &quot;Plan 9&quot; is a fairly entertaining movie.&quot; Although &quot;Flavorwire&quot; included it on its list of the 50 worst movies ever made (in the 50th spot), writer Jason Bailey described &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot;″s assessment of it as &quot;a label that stuck&quot; and opined that he did not think it was even Wood&#x27;s worst film. Likewise, John Wirt of &quot;The Advocate&quot; goes as far as to call it &quot;the ultimate cult flick&quot;, and &quot;Videohound&#x27;s Complete Guide to Cult Flicks and Trash Pics&quot; states, &quot;In fact, the film has become so famous for its own badness that it&#x27;s now beyond criticism.&quot; Barber credits &quot;Plan 9&quot;″s cult following to the film having some &quot;halfway decent&quot; elements, such as the film&#x27;s title and screen presence of actors Tor Johnson and Maila Nurmi, while film historian Rodney F. Hill considers the film to be a &quot;campy, cult masterpiece&quot; with a &quot;minimalist avant-garde aesthetic&quot;.

== 1960s ==

=== &quot;The Creeping Terror&quot; (1964) ===

The science-fiction/horror film &quot;The Creeping Terror&quot; was directed, produced, and edited by Vic Savage (under the pseudonym A.J. Nelson or Arthur Nelson, but kept his name when credited as an actor). The movie is about a large slug-like alien that lands on Earth and terrorizes a small town in California. The film is memorable for its use of some bargain-basement effects: stock footage of a rocket launch played in reverse to depict the landing of an alien spacecraft, and the &quot;monster&quot; appears to be composed of a length of shag carpet draped over several actors. Notably, the creature&#x27;s victims inexplicably stand perfectly still as the slow-moving monster approaches them.

&quot;ComingSoon.net&quot; declared it &quot;widely considered the worst picture ever made&quot;, calling &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; &quot;a bona fide magnum opus&quot; compared to &quot;The Creeping Terror&quot;. &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; and Dread Central also report that it has a reputation as being one of the worst films ever made. The film was featured in &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot;, and its follow-up book, &quot;Son of Golden Turkey Awards&quot;. &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; featured &quot;The Creeping Terror&quot; in its sixth season and British film magazine &quot;Total Film&quot; included it on its list of the 66 worst films ever made.

A documentary directed by Pete Schuermann about the making of the film, &quot;The Creep Behind The Camera&quot;, was released in 2014.

=== &quot;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians&quot; (1964) ===
The sci-fi movie &quot;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians&quot; was the creation of TV director Nicholas Webster. Because Martian children only get to see Santa Claus on TV signals beamed from Earth, their parents decide to abduct Santa to make them happy. The film was criticized for its oddity and poor special effects. It is also known for starring a very young Pia Zadora. BBC critic Nick Cramp described it as &quot;possibly the worst film ever made&quot;. The film is cited on a 10-worst list in &quot;The Book of Lists&quot; and in &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;. It has been featured in &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, &quot;Canned Film Festival&quot;, &quot;Rifftrax&quot; and &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot; (another spin-off of &quot;MST3K&quot; that revisited the film in 2008).

=== &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot; (1964) ===

&quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot; (sometimes shortened to &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures&quot;) is a 1964 American monster movie written and directed by Ray Dennis Steckler. Steckler also starred in the film, billed under the pseudonym &quot;Cash Flagg&quot;. In the film, three friends visit a carnival and stumble onto a group of occultists and disfigured monsters. Produced on a $38,000 budget, much of it takes place at The Pike amusement park in Long Beach, California, which resembles Brooklyn&#x27;s Coney Island. The film was billed as the first &quot;monster musical&quot;, beating out &quot;The Horror of Party Beach&quot; by a mere month in release date. The music critic Lester Bangs wrote an appreciative 1973 essay about &quot;Incredibly Strange Creatures&quot; in which he tries to explain and justify the movie&#x27;s value: &quot;This flick doesn&#x27;t just rebel against, or even disregard, standards of taste and art. In the universe inhabited by &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot;, such things as standards and responsibility have never been heard of. It is this lunar purity which largely imparts to the film its classic stature. Like &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; and a very few others, it will remain as an artifact in years to come to which scholars and searchers for truth can turn and say, ″&quot;This&quot; was trash! The 2004 DVD &quot;The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made&quot; listed this film as the worst film of all time. &quot;Time Out&quot; and &quot;Flavorwire&quot; included it on their respective worst film lists.

=== &quot;Monster a Go-Go!&quot; (1965) ===

&quot;Monster a Go-Go!&quot; began as &quot;Terror at Halfday&quot; by Bill Rebane. The production ran out of money and the film was abandoned. Herschell Gordon Lewis, who reportedly needed a second feature to compose a double bill, purchased and completed it for a minimal amount of money. Several of the film&#x27;s actors were unable to return, so Lewis simply replaced their parts with new characters who mysteriously appear and fill the roles of the missing characters. One of the actors Lewis managed to rehire had gained weight, gone bald, and grown a goatee, so Lewis recast him as the brother of the original character. The picture consists mostly of lengthy dialogue sequences concerning the apparent mutation of an astronaut into a monster portrayed by the 231-cm-tall (7 ft 6¾ in) Henry Hite. Poor audio quality makes much of the dialogue unintelligible, and when the film is overexposed, several characters&#x27; faces appear as bright white, glowing circles. During the climax of the movie, as soldiers prepare to confront the mutated astronaut, he abruptly vanishes and the narrator informs the audience, &quot;there was no monster&quot;, and that the astronaut has, in fact, been in the Atlantic Ocean the entire time.

&quot;NJ.com&quot; notes that many cinemaphiles consider it to be the worst film of all time, including the film&#x27;s original director Rebane. Matt Brunson of &quot;Film Frenzy&quot; agrees with its designation as one of the worst films ever made, stating it belongs in the &quot;exalted pantheon of immortal atrocities like &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, &quot;Robot Monster&quot; and &quot;&quot;.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;MovieWeb&quot; writer B. Alan Orange believes it to be the second-worst movie ever made, after &quot;&quot;. It was also featured on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, where writer Paul Chaplin called the dialogue &quot;garbled beyond recognition&quot; and declared it to be the worst movie they ever featured on the program. &quot;Total Film&quot; later included it on its list of the worst films ever made.

=== &quot;Manos: The Hands of Fate&quot; (1966) ===
The low-budget horror film &quot;Manos: The Hands of Fate&quot;, made by El Paso insurance and fertilizer salesman Hal P. Warren, concerns a vacationing family kidnapped by a polygamous cult of pagans. The film was conceived after Warren bet Academy Award-winning screenwriter Stirling Silliphant that anyone could make a horror movie. Warren was convinced by the film&#x27;s cinematographer and stunt coordinator that most of its glaring mistakes could be fixed in a Dallas post-production studio, when in reality the two wanted to quickly wrap the production because they were not being paid. Several technical gaffes made it into the film, including scenes filmed out of focus, a marking slate being seen in one shot, the scarf on the female lead&#x27;s head disappearing and reappearing, and an insect bumping the camera lens. The film was shot with a camera that could not record sound and had a 32-second maximum shot length. All dialogue was later dubbed by Warren and four others, including a grown woman who dubbed the voice for a seven-year-old girl.

&quot;Manos&quot; opens with nine minutes of monotonous driving scenes reportedly intended to be overlaid with opening credits that were never added. The movie includes dialogue spoken while all characters are facing away from the camera, a character complaining about it getting dark while the sun is brightly shining, and the character Torgo, a satyr with overly large thighs, that three women attempt to massage to death. The film gained notoriety and cult popularity by being featured on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, and was the show&#x27;s most popular episode. The film has a rare 0% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; says the movie is &quot;widely regarded as, quite simply, the worst movie ever made&quot;. Even Warren himself would later admit his film was one of the worst ever, suggesting it might make a passable comedy if redubbed. The film was later restored and released on Blu-ray in 2015.

=== &quot;A Place for Lovers&quot; (1968) ===

&quot;A Place for Lovers&quot; is a French-Italian romantic film directed by Vittorio De Sica (a filmmaker known for acclaimed neorealist works, such as &quot;Umberto D&quot; and &quot;The Bicycle Thieves&quot;), starring Faye Dunaway as a terminally ill American fashion designer in Venice, Italy, and Marcello Mastroianni as a race car driver who has a whirlwind affair with her. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called it the &quot;most godawful piece of pseudo-romantic slop I&#x27;ve ever seen!&quot; and Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; referred to it as &quot;the worst movie I have seen all year and possibly since 1926&quot;. Leonard Maltin noted Ebert&#x27;s comments in his review, and offered that the film was &quot;low points for all concerned&quot;. &quot;A Place for Lovers&quot; was included as one of the choices in &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time,&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; listed it as one of the 20 worst movies ever made.

=== &quot;They Saved Hitler&#x27;s Brain&quot; (1968) ===

&quot;They Saved Hitler&#x27;s Brain&quot; is a science fiction film directed by David Bradley. It was adapted for TV from a shorter 1963 theatrical feature film, &quot;Madmen of Mandoras&quot;, and was lengthened by about 20 minutes with additional footage shot by UCLA students at the request of the distributor. In the film, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s head was severed from his body at the end of World War II and the head plans to rule over a new Third Reich from South America. It has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on five reviews from critics, with an average rating of 1.3/10. &quot;TV Guide&quot; called it &quot;One of the all-time worst&quot;, while Danny Peary said it was &quot;A legitimate candidate for Worst Film Ever Made title.&quot; In 1979, it won the World&#x27;s Worst Film Festival in Ottawa, Canada, which reportedly delighted Bradley. It has been featured in &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot; and &quot;Canned Film Festival&quot;, and has been spoofed on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; multiple times.

== 1970s ==

=== &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1970) ===

The 1970 comedy film &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot;, based on the book of the same name by Gore Vidal, directed by Michael Sarne and starring Raquel Welch, Rex Reed, Mae West, John Huston and Farrah Fawcett, provoked controversy due to a scene in which Welch forcibly sodomizes a bound man while clips from various classic films play onscreen. The film was initially rated X before edits and an appeal to the MPAA brought it down to an R. It also used the technique of inserting clips from Golden Age movies in such a way that the dialogue took on sexual undertones. The film was a critical failure, with &quot;Time&quot; magazine saying, &quot;&quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; is about as funny as a child molester.&quot; Leonard Maltin gave it a BOMB (the lowest score possible) and stated that it was &quot;as bad as any movie ever made&quot;. &quot;The Miami News&quot; critic Herb Kelly nominated &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; as the worst film ever made. It was also included in &quot;The Book of Lists&quot;″ worst movies of all time, which claimed that there was something in it to offend absolutely everyone. Likewise, &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; also listed it as one of the worst movies ever made. Gore Vidal disowned it, calling it &quot;an awful joke&quot;, and blamed the movie for a decade-long drought in the sale of the original book.

=== &quot;Zaat&quot; (1971) ===

Directed by Don Barton, &quot;Zaat&quot; was also known under various titles including &quot;Hydra&quot;, &quot;Attack of the Swamp Creatures&quot;, &quot;Legend of the Zaat Monster&quot;, and &quot;The Blood Waters of Dr. Z&quot; (the name under which it was lampooned on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;). The film follows a Nazi mad scientist who injects himself with a formula that turns him into a mutated catfish. &quot;Florida Times-Union&quot; critic Matt Soergel quipped that &quot;Zaat&quot; &quot;could very well be the best film ever made about a mutated catfish&quot;. Critic Jeffrey Kauffman said, &quot;this is the sort of film Ed Wood, Jr. might have made—on a bad day&quot; and added, &quot;Lovers of fantastically bad films rate &quot;Zaat&quot; one of the worst&quot;. Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict stated, &quot;The acting in &quot;Zaat&quot; is below subpar. Actors seem to be whispering their lines and trying hard not to fully comprehend that they&#x27;re in one of the worst films ever made&quot;, while Michael Rubino of DVD Verdict also claimed, &quot;&quot;Zaat&quot; may be one of the worst films ever created&quot;. NPR called it a &quot;sci-fi fiasco&quot; when it became &quot;the winner — er, loser —&quot; on IMDb&#x27;s Bottom 100. &quot;Zaat&quot; appeared on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, which gave it significant exposure, and was also featured on RedLetterMedia&#x27;s show &quot;Half in the Bag&quot; where the hosts called it one of their favorite &quot;so bad it&#x27;s good&quot; films. &quot;Total Film&quot; included it in their list of the 66 worst films of all time.

=== &quot;An American Hippie in Israel&quot; (1972) ===

The 1972 Israeli film &quot;An American Hippie in Israel&quot; is about an American hippie traveling to Israel after being involved with the Vietnam War, befriending Israeli flower children, and encountering &quot;menacing&quot; mimes along the way. The film was presumed lost, but after resurfacing 38 years after its production, it became a &quot;midnight sensation&quot; in Tel Aviv and developed a cult following akin to &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;. It was then released internationally on home video by Grindhouse Releasing. Gil Shefler of &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; described it as &quot;perfectly awful&quot;, offering that it &quot;probably is the worst Israeli movie ever made, and a serious candidate for the worst movie of all time&quot;. Its description as &quot;a serious candidate for the worst movie of all time&quot; was echoed by Josh Olson in &quot;IndieWire&quot;. Ben Hartman of &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; stated the film was &quot;surely one of the worst films ever made in Israel, or beyond&quot;. &quot;Nana 10&quot; said it claims the title of &quot;worst Israeli film and most amusing&quot;.

=== &quot;Bat Pussy&quot; (circa 1973) ===

A loose spoof of the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; television series cited as one of the earliest examples of a pornographic parody film, the presumably-1970s pornographic film &quot;Bat Pussy&quot; has been described as the worst pornographic film ever made due to &quot;some incredibly unarousing sex and a general attitude of awfulness&quot;. Possessing no credits or copyright information, there is no known record of &quot;Bat Pussy&quot;″s existence prior to the mid-1990s, when it was discovered in the storeroom of an adult movie theater in Memphis, Tennessee, and subsequently released on home video by exploitation film distributor Something Weird Video. Gawker Media″s io9 proclaimed the film to be &quot;the absolute nadir of pornography, period. Not just Batman-themed pornography. ALL pornography&quot;, deriding its &quot;obese redneck&quot; cast as rendering the film &quot;wank-proof&quot;. &quot;PornParody.com&quot;, a website dedicated to the genre, acknowledged its status as &quot;the worst adult movie of all time&quot;, describing &quot;Bat Pussy&quot; as &quot;renowned for its technical ineptness and anti-eroticism&quot; due to its &quot;physically unappealing&quot; actors. &quot;AV Maniacs&quot; contested &quot;Bat Pussy&quot;″s categorization as pornography on the grounds of the lead actor&#x27;s visible erectile dysfunction and instead labeled the film &quot;anti-porn&quot;, asking &quot;How else do you categorize an adult film that completely and utterly fails to elicit even the minutest amount of arousal in its viewers?&quot; The book &quot;The Many More Lives of Batman&quot; by William Uricchio and Will Brooker also labeled &quot;Bat Pussy&quot; &quot;the worst porn film ever made&quot;, criticizing its poor adaptation of the source material.

=== &quot;At Long Last Love&quot; (theatrical version, 1975) ===
&quot;At Long Last Love&quot; was renowned director Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s musical homage to great 1930s Hollywood musicals. It features songs by Cole Porter and stars Cybill Shepherd and Burt Reynolds. &quot;Film Threat&quot; wrote that it received &quot;the most withering reviews any film ever received&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that it was &quot;savaged by critics at the time and viewed as one of the worst films ever&quot;. Richard Brody of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; compared it to the later critical failures of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; and &quot;Ishtar&quot;, writing: &quot;critics of the time heaven&#x27;s-gated [&quot;At Long Last Love&quot;], leaving Bogdanovich ishtarred and feathered&quot;. Such reviews included Hollis Alpert&#x27;s, in which he said that &quot;This failure is so dismal that it goes beyond failure&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot; critic John Simon&#x27;s, who said that &quot;it may be the worst movie musical of this – or any – decade&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;Buffalo News&quot; film critic Jeff Simon wrote, &quot;About 45 minutes in, it became apparent to one and all that this was one of the worst and most embarrassing major-talent turkeys of all time.&quot; Bogdanovich, who was also the screenwriter, sent press releases to newspapers across the country apologizing for the film.

CNN later noted that it had attained a legacy as being &quot;the worst musical extravaganza in Hollywood history&quot;, and Jay Cocks has said the film was &quot;regarded as the great white elephant catastrophe of its time&quot;. Lester J. Keyser wrote that it was &quot;justly included on most lists of the ten worst films ever made&quot;, as it was included in Michael Sauter&#x27;s &quot;The Worst Films of All Time&quot;, &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;&#x27;s worst film list.

Bogdanovich lamented being influenced by studio previews to cut the film before its theatrical release. Unbeknownst to Bogdanovich, a studio editor who preferred the director&#x27;s first cut constructed his own based on the test screening version that he once had access to. This version subsequently aired on cable TV and streamed on Netflix in place of the theatrical cut. When news of this reached Bogdanovich, he contacted Fox and made a few finishing touches, resulting in a better received director&#x27;s cut that debuted on home video in 2013.

=== &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; (1977) ===

&quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; is the sequel to William Friedkin&#x27;s Oscar-winning 1973 film, this time directed by John Boorman. Friedkin opted not to return to direct the sequel and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; states that Boorman &quot;hated the original&quot; and intended &quot;The Heretic&quot; to be an &quot;antidote [...] to wash away the evil of Friedkin&#x27;s film.&quot; Set four years after the first film, Linda Blair reprised her role as Regan MacNeil, who is revealed to have healing powers, and Richard Burton stars as Father Philip Lamont, who believes that the demon Pazuzu targets those with healing abilities. Blair agreed to return for the sequel as long as she did not have to wear the possession make-up from the first film, leading to the use of an unconvincing stand-in, while Burton read his lines off cue cards. Despite his character dying in the original film, Max von Sydow returned for flashback sequences set in Africa, where Lamont flies to on the back of a locust.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; notes that some consider it the worst film ever made. British film critic Mark Kermode called the original film his favorite film of all time but believes the sequel to be the worst film ever made, stating, &quot;This is a film that trashes a work of art. It&#x27;s like someone deciding to do a &quot;Mona Lisa 2&quot;, but with a moustache.&quot; The &quot;Golden Turkey Awards&quot; named it the second-worst film ever made, after &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, and it also appeared in &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; listed it as the worst sequel of all time and critic Bill Chambers stated it was &quot;Possibly the worst film ever made and surely the worst sequel ever made.&quot; Friedkin believed the sequel diminished the value of the original film and called it &quot;the worst piece of shit I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; and &quot;a fucking disgrace.&quot; Eventually, the film garnered so much hate that Boorman disowned it. In an interview with Bob McCabe for the book &quot;The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows&quot;, he confessed, &quot;The sin I committed was not giving the audience what it wanted in terms of horror.&quot; A third installment in the &quot;Exorcist&quot; franchise, &quot;The Exorcist III: Legion&quot;, was released in 1990 and would in later years gain a cult following, with author Nat Segaloff writing that, &quot;The first rule of &quot;Exorcist III&quot; is: you do not talk about &quot;Exorcist II&quot;.&quot;

=== &quot;The Swarm&quot; (1978) ===

&quot;The Swarm&quot; is a 1978 horror film about a killer bee invasion of Texas, directed and produced by Irwin Allen. Despite its all-star cast (including Michael Caine, Henry Fonda, Richard Widmark and Olivia de Havilland), it was a box-office failure and was excoriated by reviewers. On its UK release, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; described &quot;The Swarm&quot; as &quot;simply the worst film ever made&quot;. Leslie Halliwell described it as a &quot;very obvious disaster movie with risible dialogue&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; article on &quot;The Swarm&quot; stated, &quot;You could pass it all off as a sick joke, except it cost twelve million dollars, twenty-two million bees, and several years of someone&#x27;s life.&quot; Barry Took, reviewing it for &quot;Punch&quot;, stated, &quot;the story is of a banality matched only by the woodenness of the acting&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine called &quot;The Swarm&quot; a &quot;risibly inadequate disaster movie&quot;. &quot;The Swarm&quot; is included in several &quot;worst movie&quot; books, including the Medved brothers&#x27; &quot;The Golden Turkey Awards&quot;, and &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot;. It soon gained a cult status (enough so that Warner Archive released the extended version on Blu-ray).

=== &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; (1978) ===

&quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; became controversial for its graphic violence and lengthy depictions of gang rape. It was initially unable to find a distributor until 1980 when it received a wider release. Luke Y. Thompson of the &quot;New Times&quot; stated, &quot;Defenders of the film have argued that it&#x27;s actually pro-woman, due to the fact that the female lead wins in the end, which is sort of like saying that cockfights are pro-rooster because there&#x27;s always one left standing&quot;. Critic David Keyes named &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; the worst film of the 1980s and James Livingston wrote in &quot;The World Turned Inside Out&quot; that it was &quot;a terrifically bad movie&quot;. Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it &quot;one of the era&#x27;s most abhorrent pieces of exploitation trash&quot; and Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict stated, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the most soulless, vile, and morally reprehensible things I&#x27;ve ever had to sit through.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film no stars, referring to it as &quot;A vile bag of garbage ... without a shred of artistic distinction,&quot; adding, &quot;Attending it was one of the most depressing experiences of my life&quot; and considered it the worst movie ever made. Gene Siskel also considered it one of the worst films ever made. &quot;Film Racket&quot; featured it as their first entry in to their &quot;Worst Movie Ever?&quot; series, while &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Flavorwire&quot; included it in their worst film lists. Despite the intense negative reception from some critics, the film has a 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with &quot;IGN&quot; critic R.L. Shaffer arguing that whether the film is repulsive and exploitative or ingenious depends on what the viewer wants from the movie: &quot;Admittedly, &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; is a gruesome, deplorable little exploitation picture that, on the surface, seems to enjoy its rape sequences just as much, if not more, than the vengeance-filled finale. But on a more subtle level, the film is a surprisingly well-executed revenge story that plays like a brutally raw nerve – a terrifyingly stark view of the real horror of rape, painted by bizarre, skewed cinematography, gory violence, and a keen sense of creeping atmosphere and dread.&quot;

=== &quot;Caligula&quot; (theatrical version, 1979) ===

The 1979 erotic historical drama &quot;Caligula&quot;, directed by Tinto Brass about the infamous Roman Emperor Caligula, was in part financed by &quot;Penthouse&quot; founder Bob Guccione. The film, featuring a prestigious cast (Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O&#x27;Toole, and John Gielgud) is notorious for explicit scenes of sex and violence, including six minutes of hardcore porn footage filmed by Guccione and another editor without Brass&#x27; approval. &quot;Caligula&quot; earned some pre-release controversy after Gore Vidal, who had written the script, distanced himself from the film, and actress Maria Schneider, who objected to the nude scenes, walked off the set and was replaced with then-unknown Teresa Ann Savoy. Upon its release, Vidal stated that it was &quot;easily one of the worst films ever made&quot;.

&quot;Caligula&quot; also received strongly hostile reviews from critics, who denounced its extreme scenes of sex and violence and lack of narrative coherence. Roger Ebert gave &quot;Caligula&quot; a zero-star rating, dubbing it &quot;sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash&quot;, accusing it of being artistically vulgar in its depiction of sex and violence, and of having technically incompetent direction and structure. It was one of the few films Ebert ever walked out on (two hours into its 170-minute running time), after describing himself as feeling &quot;disgusted and unspeakably depressed&quot;. Ebert also placed it on his &quot;Most Hated&quot; list and Michael Sauter selected it for &quot;The Worst Movies of All Time&quot;. Australian newspaper &quot;The Age&quot; stated that &quot;Caligula&quot; was being &quot;billed by critics everywhere as one of the worst films ever made&quot;. &quot;The Hamilton Spectator&quot; later referred to &quot;Caligula&quot; as &quot;possibly the worst movie ever made&quot;. Joe Holleman, in an article in the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; discussing historical films set in Ancient Rome, argued, &quot;two of the worst movies made in the 20th century were ancient Rome pieces ... &quot;Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Caligula&quot;&quot;. Christopher Armstead, reviewing &quot;Caligula&quot; for the website Film Critics United, stated, &quot;Dollar for dollar, this could very well be the worst movie ever made.&quot; In 2011, Sean Bell of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote of its enduring legacy: &quot;in the same way much of our attention-deficit civilisation may go through life vaguely aware that &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is a masterpiece without ever seeing it, ... we know that &quot;Caligula&quot; is awful, usually without ever finding out for ourselves.&quot;

Although widely criticized, the film&#x27;s &quot;over-the-top combination of outré aesthetics [and] exploitation-film tropes&quot; has gained it cult status over time, and in 2024, Thomas Negovan released an extensive re-edit, &quot;Caligula: The Ultimate Cut&quot;, incorporating alternate takes and unused footage from the &quot;Penthouse&quot; archives to enhance narrative coherence while shortening the film&#x27;s overall length. In a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Elisabeth Vincentelli said that it is a &quot;rare re-edited version of a movie that features &quot;less&quot; graphic sex and violence than the original.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, McDowell praised the removal of sexually explicit material added by Guccione, and said &quot;The Ultimate Cut&quot; is &quot;very much the movie I thought I was making&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Ultimate Cut&quot; holds an 64% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 39 reviews; however, Brass has publicly disowned it.

== 1980s ==

=== &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (theatrical version, 1980) ===
The Western epic &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, loosely based on the Johnson County War in 1890s Wyoming, was plagued by massive cost and time overruns, largely due to director Michael Cimino&#x27;s extreme attention to detail. He demanded 50 takes of at least one scene and refused to start shooting for another until a cloud he liked rolled across the sky. It cost over $44 million, but brought in only $3.5 million at the box office. The original version ran at nearly four hours, but was pulled from release after only one week due to scathing reviews. It later resurfaced in a 149-minute version, but by then the damage was done. The film effectively ended not only the existence of United Artists as an independent Hollywood studio (its parent firm sold the company to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where it operated until 2019), but also, largely, Cimino&#x27;s career; initially considered a director on the rise after directing &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; (which won five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director), his reputation never recovered after &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;. The production is also notorious for the cruelty to animals that occurred both on screen and on site, including deliberately killing a horse with explosives. The controversies surrounding &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;″s failure are credited for having a role in ending the &quot;auteur period&quot; of the 1970s, with studios subsequently taking control back from directors.

Vincent Canby called it &quot;an unqualified disaster&quot;, among other things. Roger Ebert called it &quot;the most scandalous cinematic waste I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. After word of his grandiose spending and defiant nature toward studio United Artists got out (detailed in &quot;Final Cut&quot; by Steven Bach, a studio executive involved with the film from the beginning), Cimino was awarded the 1980 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director, and the film was nominated for four more Razzies, including Worst Picture. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it as one of the worst decisions in movie history. In 2008, Joe Queenan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it the worst film ever made, saying that it &quot;defies belief&quot;. Readers of film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; later voted &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; the sixth-worst film of all time, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; included it in its list of the worst films ever made.

Despite the vicious reviews, the film&#x27;s reputation improved over time. In fall of 2012, the New York Film Festival, the venue for its infamous opening, premiered the restored director&#x27;s cut. In stark contrast, &quot;The Times&quot; called the restored version &quot;a modern masterpiece&quot; and its 1980 cut &quot;one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history&quot;. The film has also been released on Blu-ray and DVD by the Criterion Collection. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the film &quot;has been called a disaster and a disgrace, yet also anointed a masterpiece.&quot; In 2023, the French magazine &quot;Télérama&quot; ranked it 17th in its list of the 100 greatest films in the history of cinema, describing the work as &quot;a post-classical, lyrical, and disenchanted Western&quot;.

=== &quot;The Apple&quot; (1980) ===

&quot;The Apple&quot; (also called &quot;Star Rock&quot;) is a 1980 science fiction musical comedy film written and directed by Menahem Golan. It stars Catherine Mary Stewart as a young singer named Bibi, who, in a futuristic 1994, signs to an evil label named Boogalow International Music. It deals with themes of conformity versus rebellion, and makes use of Biblical allegory, including that of Adam and Eve and the rapture.

Common criticism from both reviews that appeared in trade publications and major news outlets and the audience were a lack of originality, a weak script, uninspired music, poor execution, and Golan&#x27;s inexperienced take on the 1960s hippie movement. During the 1980 Montreal World Film Festival, some members of the audience threw vinyl records of music from the film at the screen. At the 1980 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film received seven nominations (including Worst Picture) and won two awards: Worst Director (Golan) and Least &quot;Special&quot; Special Effects. Stinkers co-founder Mike Lancaster later selected &quot;The Apple&quot; as the worst film he had ever seen. &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; listed it as the worst movie musical ever, and critic Tim Brayton described it as &quot;A completely unadulterated bundle of the worst of cinema all spun up into one ball of madness. It cannot be described, and it can barely be experienced.&quot; Sean Burns in &quot;Philadelphia Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;The Apple&quot; isn&#x27;t just the worst disco musical ever made; it could very well be the worst movie ever made, period.&quot; &quot;The Apple&quot; was included in &quot;Paste&quot;″s &quot;Bad Movie Diaries&quot; column, where critic Kenneth Lowe described it as &quot;without a doubt the most cringe-inducing, the most mortifying, the absolutely most embarrassing feature we&#x27;ve ever watched.&quot; It has also been covered by the &quot;How Did This Get Made?&quot; podcast and &quot;Flavorwire&quot;″s &quot;Bad Movie Night&quot; column and &quot;Mental Floss&quot; listed it as one of the &quot;Ten Really Bad Movies that Define &#x27;Bad Movies&#x27;&quot;.

=== &quot;Inchon&quot; (1981) === 

The war film &quot;Inchon&quot;, directed by Terence Young and starring Laurence Olivier as General Douglas MacArthur, was meant to depict the Battle of Inchon during the Korean War. Producer Mitsuharu Ishii was a senior member of the Japanese branch of the Unification Church, whose leader, Sun Myung Moon, claimed he had the film made to show MacArthur&#x27;s spirituality and connection to God and the Japanese people. Its eventual production cost of $46 million resulted in a $5 million box-office gross, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; review written by Vincent Canby calls the movie &quot;the most expensive B-movie ever&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described &quot;Inchon&quot; as &quot;one of the biggest commercial disasters in film history&quot;. Every conceivable kind of problem plagued production, including labor issues, the U.S. military withdrawing support due to the film&#x27;s Unification Church connection, weather and natural disasters, customs difficulties, expensive directorial blunders, and the original director (Andrew McLaglen) quitting before the start of production. Olivier&#x27;s performance was criticized, and he was awarded the 1982 Golden Raspberry award for Worst Actor. The film itself took the 1982 Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, and Young&#x27;s direction earned him a tie for Worst Director of 1982. A number of reviewers at various media outlets described &quot;Inchon&quot; as the worst film ever made, including &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, and the Canadian Press. &quot;Inchon&quot; was later profiled in multiple books on worst in film, including &quot;The Hollywood Hall of Shame&quot; by Harry and Michael Medved, and &quot;The Worst Movies of All Time&quot; by Michael Sauter. To date, &quot;Inchon&quot; has never been released on home video in the United States although it was aired on the church&#x27;s Good Life TV Network.

=== &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot; (1981) ===

The adventure film &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot;, loosely based on the novel &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot; by Edgar Rice Burroughs, stars Miles O&#x27;Keeffe (who would later star in the 1982 &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; knock-off &quot;Ator the Invincible&quot;, which alongside its sequel featured in two episodes of the TV series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;) in the title role and Bo Derek as his partner Jane Parker, and is told from Jane&#x27;s point of view. Despite being a box-office success, critics poorly received it upon its release due to its poor screenplay, bad acting, and unintentional humor. Leonard Maltin, writing for his &quot;Movie Guide&quot;, stated that the film &quot;lacks action, humor and charm&quot;, and considered it so bad that it &quot;nearly forced editors of this book to devise a rating lower than BOMB&quot;. Leslie Halliwell was equally harsh; he described &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot; as &quot;certainly the worst of the Tarzan movies and possibly the banalest film so far made; even the animals give poor performances&quot;. Writer Thomas S. Hischak described it thus: &quot;Produced and directed without a shred of talent by John Derek, &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot; often ranks high in the lists of the worst movies ever made.&quot; Film critic John Nesbit considered it &quot;my pick for worst film ever&quot;, while Matt Brunson of &quot;Creative Loafing&quot; wrote, &quot;this cinematic atrocity truly is one of the all-time worsts&quot;. &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot; was nominated for six awards at the 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards, winning one for Worst Actress (Bo Derek). It holds a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews.

=== &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; (1981) ===
&quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;, directed by Frank Perry, was based on the memoir of the same name by Christina Crawford, about her upbringing by Joan Crawford. It was the first film to sweep the Golden Raspberry Awards nominations, winning a total of five Razzies out of the nine nominations, including &quot;Worst Picture&quot; and Worst Actress (Faye Dunaway, shared with Bo Derek). The same organization also named it &quot;Worst Picture of the Decade&quot; in 1989/90, and was nominated for &quot;Worst Drama of Our First 25 Years&quot; in 2004/05. The film is part of the &quot;100 most awful&quot; in &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; and Michael Sauter&#x27;s &quot;The Worst Movies of All Time&quot;. It earned, as film critic and TV host Richard Crouse put it, &quot;some of the nastiest reviews ever&quot;. Eric Henderson of &quot;CBS Minneapolis&quot; named it at the top of his &quot;Best &#x27;Worst Movies Ever list. Roger Ebert wrote of this film, &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine who would want to subject themselves to this movie. &#x27;Mommie Dearest&#x27; is a painful experience that drones on endlessly, as Joan Crawford&#x27;s relationship with her daughter, Christina, disintegrates from cruelty through jealousy into pathos.&quot; Of the performance of Faye Dunaway, &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;Dunaway does not chew scenery. Dunaway starts neatly at each corner of the set in every scene and swallows it whole, co-stars and all.&quot; &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and Rotten Tomatoes subsequently included &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; on their worst film lists.

Despite the reviews at the time, the film was a box-office success, grossing $39 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. It has a 50% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 46 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; certainly doesn&#x27;t lack for conviction, and neither does Faye Dunaway&#x27;s legendary performance as a wire-wielding monster; unfortunately, the movie is too campy and undisciplined to transcend guilty pleasure&quot;.

=== &quot;Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam&quot; (&quot;The Man Who Saves the World&quot;) (1982) ===

The Turkish science-fiction adventure &quot;Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam&quot; (also commonly known as &quot;Turkish Star Wars&quot;) was directed by Çetin İnanç and starred Cüneyt Arkın. It is notorious for illegally using footage from well-known science fiction films and shows, most notably &quot;Star Wars&quot;, along with stealing the music score from films such as &quot;Moonraker&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. The film is also criticized for its nonsensical plot, badly written dialogue, and crude special effects. It is also a fantasy martial arts film, heavily influenced by 1970s Hong Kong martial arts films from Golden Harvest.

Jos Kirps of ArticlesBase called it &quot;The Worst Movie Ever&quot;, and stated, &quot;There are many bad sci-fi movies, and for many years movie addicts even considered Ed Wood&#x27;s &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot; the worst movie of all times. But &quot;Plan 9&quot; is still a pretty good movie when compared to &quot;Dünyayi Kurtaran Adam&quot;.&quot; &quot;Sabah&quot; called it the &quot;world&#x27;s worst film&quot;. &quot;Hürriyet&quot; described the film as &quot;sitting on the throne of the king&quot; when compared to other &quot;so bad it&#x27;s good&quot; cult films. &quot;Toronto Standard&quot; called it a &quot;dollar-store Star Wars&quot; and compared it to the works of Ed Wood. When it became apparent that the film had inspired an enthusiastic international cult, a sequel, &quot;The Son of the Man Who Saved the World&quot; (&quot;Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam&#x27;ın Oğlu&quot;), was shot in 2006 and featured many returning members of the original cast and crew. The film was included on &quot;Time Out&quot;″s 40 Best Bad Movies Ever Made list.

=== &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; (1986) ===

Directed by Willard Huyck, written by Huyck and Gloria Katz, and produced by George Lucas, it is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; received overwhelmingly negative reviews from film critics. &quot;Orange Coast Magazine&quot; writer Marc Weinberg and Leonard Maltin criticized the decision to shoot the film in live action. The appearance of Howard was criticized as being unconvincing due to his poorly functioning mouth and expressionless face. Reviewers also criticized the acting and humor and found the film boring. Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said the movie&#x27;s &quot;crude, often embarrassing, sex jokes&quot; seemed &quot;out of place&quot; with the more innocent aspects of the film. Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; claimed that &quot;They Don&#x27;t Get Much Worse Than &quot;Howard&quot;, Glenn Heath Jr. of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wrote that it &quot;has a rightful place in the canon of worst films ever&quot;, and &quot;TV Guide&quot; states it is &quot;one of the worst big-budget movies ever made&quot;. It was featured in &quot;Empire&quot;″s poll of the 50 worst films ever made, and &quot;Screen Rant&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; have included it on their worst film lists.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 13% based on 86 reviews, making it the lowest-rated Lucasfilm production of those reviewed on the site. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;While it has its moments, &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; suffers from an uneven tone and mediocre performances.&quot; It received seven Golden Raspberry Award nominations in 1987 including Worst Supporting Actor (Tim Robbins), Worst Director (Willard Huyck) and Worst Original Song (&quot;Howard the Duck&quot;). It won four trophies for Worst Screenplay, Worst New Star (&quot;the six guys and gals in the duck suit&quot;), Worst Visual Effects, and Worst Picture, tied with &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot;. The movie also won a Stinkers Bad Movie Awards for Worst Picture. The negative reaction to the film took its toll on the cast, who found themselves unable to work on other projects as a result.

Over time, the film has remained a source of fascination and developed &quot;a small, but loyal fanbase.&quot; Howard the Duck has appeared in several Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and series beginning in 2014&#x27;s &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, in which he was voiced by Seth Green.

=== &quot;Ishtar&quot; (1987) ===
&quot;Ishtar&quot; was written and directed by Elaine May and starred Oscar-winning duo Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman as an ode to the &quot;Road to...&quot; film series featuring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. Beatty and Hoffman star as Rogers and Clarke, two untalented lounge singers who travel to Morocco in hopes of finding a gig. Due to unanticipated problems with filming in the desert—which resulted in numerous reshoots—the film ran over budget by $30 million. While its final budget cost was $55 million, &quot;Ishtar&quot; earned only $14,375,181 at the North American box office, leading &quot;Ishtar&quot; to become synonymous with &quot;box-office flop&quot;. It was also subject to harsh reviews from critics. The film was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay in the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards, winning one for Worst Director. &quot;The San Jose Mercury News&quot; claimed that &quot;Time has not improved this film&#x27;s reputation as being one of the worst ever made.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; suggested it was &quot;so bad it could have been deliberate&quot;, and called it &quot;one of the worst films ever made&quot;, while Ed Morrissey referred to it as &quot;The &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of big-budget, A-list vehicular homicides.&quot; It was included in Michael Sauter&#x27;s &quot;The Worst Movies of All Time&quot; book, Rotten Tomatoes placed it amongst &quot;25 Moves So Bad They&#x27;re Unmissable&quot; and Richard Roeper included it on his list of the 40 worst films he had seen. In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century.

The film has since become a cult classic. &quot;Ishtar&quot; has seen a minor critical re-evaluation from some critics like Richard Brody, and directors Quentin Tarantino, Edgar Wright, and Martin Scorsese have praised it in interviews. Gary Larson, who initially lampooned the movie in &quot;The Far Side&quot;, said he regrets writing that cartoon because he based it solely on &quot;Ishtar&quot;″s reputation, and that he enjoyed the film when he later watched it. As of December 2022, it is the only cartoon he has publicly admitted to regretting. Defenders argue that the studio did not back May, resulting in a public relations disaster before it was released in theaters. Joe Queenan compared the film to another comedy film considered the worst, &quot;Gigli&quot;, and wrote that although it was considered one of the worst films ever made at the time of its release, it &quot;has several comic moments&quot; and does not get worse on subsequent viewings, unlike &quot;Gigli&quot;.

=== &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot; (1987) ===
&quot;Leonard Part 6&quot;, starring (as well as written and produced by) Bill Cosby, was intended as a parody of spy movies. Leonard Parker, a former CIA spy, is brought out of retirement to save the world from an evil vegetarian who brainwashes animals to kill people. Rita Kempley at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted the large number of Coca-Cola product placements and said &quot;The only good thing about Bill Cosby&#x27;s &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot; is that we didn&#x27;t have to see Parts 1 through 5.&quot; Scott Weinberg at DVD Talk noted the film as &quot;truly one of the worst movies you&#x27;ll ever see ... movies this bad should be handled with Teflon gloves and a pair of tongs&quot;. By 1990, Dennis King of the &quot;Tulsa World&quot; wrote that the film had &quot;become synonymous with &#x27;bomb.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Total Film&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; subsequently included &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot; on their respective worst film lists. Cosby himself disowned the film, and when it was released to theaters he publicly advised people not to see it. It earned Golden Raspberrys for Worst Actor (Cosby), Worst Picture, and Worst Screenplay. It was also nominated for two more Razzie Awards, for Worst Supporting Actress and Worst Director. Cosby became the first person to accept a Golden Raspberry Award, and said &quot;It was the worst movie I ever made – the worst movie anyone ever made&quot;.

=== &quot;Nukie&quot; (1987) ===

&quot;Nukie&quot; is a 1987 South African film directed by Sias Odendaal (credited as Sias Odendal) and Michael Pakleppa, and starring Steve Railsback, Ronald France, and Glynis Johns. The plot concerns an alien, Nukie, who crash lands on Earth and seeks help from two children to reunite with his brother, Miko, who has been captured by the United States government. The film is considered to be a knock-off of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Witney Seibold of &quot;/Film&quot; writes that &quot;&quot;Nukie&quot; is only remarkable for how undeniably terrible it is&quot;, noting that it appears on lists of the worst films ever made. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; note that it is &quot;regarded as one of the worst movies ever made&quot;, with critic Brad Jones selecting &quot;Nukie&quot; as the worst film he has ever seen, and Red Letter Media calling it &quot;Possibly one of the worst films ever made.&quot; &quot;Total Film&quot; write that it is considered by some to be the &quot;most painful movie ever made&quot;; they listed &quot;Nukie&quot; the worst kids movie ever made and one of the worst science-fiction films ever made. The film&#x27;s co-director, Michael Pakleppa, referred to &quot;Nukie&quot; as &quot;the most wrong-gone thing [he had] ever done in [his] life&quot; and feared that the final product was &quot;the worst film on Earth.&quot;

=== &quot;The Garbage Pail Kids Movie&quot; (1987) ===

&quot;The Garbage Pail Kids Movie&quot; is a 1987 live-action adaptation of the then-popular trading card series of the same name, itself a gross-out parody of the then-popular Cabbage Patch Kids dolls co-created by Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Art Spiegelman. The film is often criticized for its gross-out humor, nonsensical plot, poor explanations, bad acting, and the unsettling appearance of the Garbage Pail Kids (the title characters are depicted by dwarf actors in low-budget costumes, with poorly functioning mouths and expressionless faces). It has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 1, making it tied for the lowest scoring film on the site. Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the movie is &quot;too repulsive for children or adults of any age&quot; and is &quot;enough to make you believe in strict and faraway boarding schools&quot;. Carlos Coto of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; called it &quot;one of the worst ever made&quot;. Internet critic Doug Walker, best known for the series &quot;Nostalgia Critic&quot;, stated that it was not only the worst film he had ever reviewed as the Nostalgia Critic, but the worst movie he had ever seen overall, deeming that the film served to undermine its own moral.

Much of the film&#x27;s content is said to be inappropriate for children, its intended audience. Throughout the movie, the Garbage Pail Kids steal, get in fights, bite people&#x27;s toes off, flatulate in people&#x27;s faces, threaten others with switchblades, urinate upon themselves, and run over cars. In addition to scatological behavior, the movie has several scenes that feature sexual images, violence, and drinking. Offended parents launched a nationwide protest of the movie that successfully resulted in the movie being withdrawn from circulation. The shortened release contributed to the movie&#x27;s poor gross of only $1,576,615. It was nominated for three Razzies at the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Visual Effects, Worst New Star for the Garbage Pail Kids collectively, and Worst Original Song.

=== &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2&quot; (1987) ===

&quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2&quot; is the sequel to the 1984 Christmas-themed slasher film &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night&quot;, which faced protests from parent groups and sharp criticism from &quot;At the Movies&quot; hosts Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel due to its promotional campaign featuring an ax-wielding Santa Claus. The film was a financial success despite the controversy, leading producers to enlist Lee Harry to repurpose its footage for a new project; however, $100,000 was eventually allocated to shoot additional original material. Nearly half of the &quot;Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2&quot;″s runtime consists of flashbacks to the first film, narrated by Ricky Caldwell (Eric Freeman), the brother of the original film&#x27;s protagonist, as he recounts events before embarking on his own murderous rampage.

Much of the film&#x27;s reception and legacy centers on Freeman&#x27;s performance, which &quot;Flavorwire&quot; states &quot;may very well be the single worst performance ever committed to celluloid,&quot; and Nathan Rabin states: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure whether Freeman gives the worst performance of all time or the best here but it is one of the most unique starring turns in the history of film.&quot; A scene in which Ricky shouts &quot;garbage day!&quot; before shooting and killing a bystander taking out his trash became an Internet meme after being uploaded to YouTube in its early years. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; has since deemed the film to be &quot;a masterpiece of the so bad it&#x27;s good variety,&quot; and &quot;one of the worst movies ever made.&quot; Meanwhile, Rabin stated it was &quot;the sleaziest, craziest, worst and most ridiculous movie ever made. That’s why it’s great and every one should see it.&quot; Emmett O&#x27;Regan of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; also selected it as the worst movie ever made, and an article in &quot;Paste&quot; asserted that: &quot;in terms of filmmaking quality—it’s hard to believe that in terms of pure, unadulterated crap, anything could ever surpass it.&quot; Additionally, &quot;Flavorwire&quot;, &quot;/Film&quot;, and &quot;Paste&quot; have all listed it as the worst Christmas film ever made. &quot;Time Out&quot; and &quot;Flavorwire&quot; later included it on their respective lists of the worst films ever made.

=== &quot;Hobgoblins&quot; (1988) ===

&quot;Hobgoblins&quot;, by Rick Sloane, is widely considered a low-budget knock-off that capitalizes on the popularity of the 1984 film &quot;Gremlins.&quot; It gained popularity in 1998 after being featured on an episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. &quot;MST3K&quot; writer Paul Chaplin later commented on &quot;Hobgoblins&quot;, saying, &quot;Oh, man. You have no idea the torture it was to watch this movie several times in the space of a week. It shoots right to the top of the list of the worst movies we&#x27;ve ever done.&quot; Specific points of the film that were lampooned were the extreme misogyny and atrocious treatment of women; the film&#x27;s technical incompetence and repetitive scenes; its asinine, poorly conceived plot; its dreadful acting; and its ugly look and gratuitous vulgarity, particularly in regards to its characters and subject matter. David Cornelius of DVD Talk stated, &quot;There&#x27;s not one aspect of this movie that isn&#x27;t the Worst Thing Ever.&quot; &quot;The Standard&quot;″s &quot;Bad Horror Club&quot; noted its status as one of the worst films of all time, commenting: &quot;it’s so preposterously badly made, terribly acted and ineptly constructed that it makes for some of the most fun you can ever have watching a movie.&quot;

Sloane has embraced &quot;Hobgoblins&quot;″ status as one of the worst films of all time, stating that he fears that it will be forgotten if it is removed from IMDb&#x27;s user-generated bottom 100 list. After seeing the &quot;MST3K&quot; episode himself, Sloane was inspired to direct a sequel, which was released in 2009. In addition to IMDb, it has been featured on lists from &quot;Flavorwire&quot; and &quot;Total Film&quot;.

=== &quot;Mac and Me&quot; (1988) ===

&quot;Mac and Me&quot; is about a young boy in a wheelchair who meets and befriends an alien who has crash-landed on Earth. A box-office failure, the film grossed $6,424,112 in the United States on a $13 million budget. It used to have a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, whose critical consensus notes that it is &quot;duly infamous&quot; as both an imitation of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), and a marketing vehicle for McDonald&#x27;s and Coca-Cola (the filmmakers had admitted a profit-sharing arrangement with the former). Leonard Maltin described the film as being &quot;more like a TV commercial than a movie&quot;, and Marjorie Baumgarten of the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; called it a &quot;shameless &quot;E.T.&quot; knockoff&quot;. &quot;Mac and Me&quot; is widely regarded as one of the worst films ever made, with &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reporting that it is &quot;frequently pulled out in &#x27;worst film of all time&#x27; arguments&quot;. Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock (responsible for the 2004 Oscar-nominated &quot;Super Size Me&quot;) declared it the &quot;worst thing you&#x27;ll ever see in your entire life&quot;, as well as the most egregious example of product placement in cinema history. The film was also named the worst ever in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, as well as by broadcaster Simon Mayo and writer/producer Damon Lindelof. Michael Hayden of &quot;GQ India&quot; referred to it as &quot;hands down the worst family movie in Hollywood history&quot;. The film was nominated for four Razzie Awards including Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, and won two trophies: Worst Director for Stewart Raffill (tied with Blake Edwards for &quot;Sunset&quot;) and Worst New Star for Ronald McDonald in a cameo. &quot;Mac and Me&quot; has however gained a cult following and was featured on the second season of the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; revival (the only Razzie-winning film ever to be riffed in the history of the show).

=== &quot;Things&quot; (1989) ===

&quot;Things&quot;, a 1989 Canadian low budget, independent, horror exploitation film, was written and produced by Andrew Jordan &amp; Barry J. Gillis. It cost approximately $35,000 in total to make and marked the mainstream film debut of porn star Amber Lynn. It was ostensibly made as homage to horror icons and films, such as George A. Romero and his &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; franchise. Adam Symchuk of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; writes: &quot;While films like &quot;The Room&quot; and &quot;&quot; seem to be constant contenders for the best &#x27;so bad it&#x27;s good&#x27; movie, [&quot;Things&quot;] is the true unheralded champion among many cinephiles.&quot; Likewise, Jeff Kirschner of Dread Central nominated it as the worst movie ever made and Will Pfeifer opined that &quot;It&#x27;s so terrible I can&#x27;t think of another movie that even comes close.&quot; In 2022, RiffTrax concluded that &quot;Things&quot; was the worst movie that they had ever spoofed.

== 1990s ==

=== &quot;Troll 2&quot; (1990) ===

Despite its title, &quot;Troll 2&quot; does not feature any trolls (the antagonists are actually goblins) and has no relation to the original 1986 film. &quot;Troll 2&quot; was produced under the title &quot;Goblins&quot;, but the title was changed by American distributors. In the film, an American family vacations to the town of Nilbog (goblin spelled backwards), where vegetarian goblins attempt to turn the family into edible plants. It was shot in Utah and the cast was composed of local amateur actors. A language barrier developed between the cast and the Italian crew, led by director Claudio Fragasso, who had translated the script to English. The bad acting and dialogue have become notorious for their camp value, with individual scenes having become Internet memes. In 2009, Michael Stephenson, the child star of &quot;Troll 2&quot;, released &quot;Best Worst Movie&quot;, a documentary exploring the film&#x27;s tumultuous production and its unexpected cult following.

NPR reports that it is &quot;known as the worst movie of all time&quot; while &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; calls it &quot;a popular candidate for the worst film ever made&quot;. Likewise, &quot;TV Guide&quot; proclaimed that &quot;&quot;Troll 2&quot; is really as bad as they come,&quot; and Ken Hanke of &quot;Mountain Xpress&quot; stated in his review that: &quot;There are movies that are bad. There are movies that are so-bad-they&#x27;re-good. And then there&#x27;s &quot;Troll 2&quot;—a movie that&#x27;s so bad that it defies comprehension.&quot; &quot;Troll 2&quot; regularly appears on lists of films considered the worst, including: &quot;Flavorwire&quot;, &quot;Fotogramas&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;, Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, and &quot;Time Out&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;Collider&quot; named it the most rewatchable bad movie of all time.

=== &quot;Highlander II: The Quickening&quot; (theatrical version, 1991) ===

The French-British film &quot;Highlander II: The Quickening&quot; is a sequel to the 1986 cult film &quot;Highlander,&quot; which transitions the fantasy of the original film into science fiction, and retcons the mystical warriors of the first film into aliens. It received a harsh reception from both critics and audiences, as it has a 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes and appears on its 100 Worst Movies of All Time. Common criticisms included the lack of motivation for the characters, blatant disregard for backstory from the first film (such as the new and seemingly incongruent origin for the Immortals and the unexplained resurrection of Ramírez), glaring plot holes, a messy and nonsensical story structure, the filmmaker&#x27;s inability to balance unrelated plots and subplots, and obvious contradictions in the film&#x27;s internal logic. In selecting it as the worst movie sequel of all time, Comic Book Resources also wrote that &quot;it is typically considered one of the worst films of all time.&quot; Roger Ebert named it the worst film of 1991, stating: &quot;If there is a planet somewhere whose civilization is based on the worst movies of all time, &quot;Highlander 2: The Quickening&quot; deserves a sacred place among their most treasured artifacts.&quot; An IGN review said: &quot;How bad is this movie? Well, imagine if Ed Wood were alive today, and someone gave him a multi-million dollar budget. See his imagination running rampant, bringing in aliens from outer space with immensely powerful firearms, immortals who bring each other back to life by calling out their names, epic duels on flying skateboards, and a blatant disregard for anything logical or previously established—now you are starting to get closer to the vision of &quot;Highlander II&quot;.&quot; &quot;Screen Rant&quot; has since included it on its list of the 25 worst films of all time.

In 1995, the film&#x27;s director Russell Mulcahy made a director&#x27;s cut version known as &quot;Highlander 2: Renegade Version&quot; and then later released another version simply known as &quot;Highlander 2: The Special Edition&quot; for its 2004 DVD release. The film was reconstructed on both occasions largely from existing material, with certain scenes removed and others added back in, and the entire sequence of events changed. The reconstructed film&#x27;s reception was far better than the original&#x27;s; it was elevated to a mixed reception.

=== &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1993) ===
The first feature-length live-action film based on a video game, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; was directed by the husband-and-wife team of Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel (known for their work on &quot;Max Headroom&quot;). It follows the brothers Mario (Bob Hoskins) and Luigi (John Leguizamo), plumbers who venture into a parallel universe to rescue Princess Daisy (Samantha Mathis) from the villainous King Koopa (Dennis Hopper). The &quot;Super Mario&quot; series&#x27; publisher, Nintendo, believed the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise was strong enough for experimentation and gave the filmmakers free creative license. The finished film bears little resemblance to the games, trading their colorful Mushroom Kingdom for a dystopic world populated by humanoid dinosaurs. &quot;SyFy Wire&quot; wrote: &quot;Some movies are so bad that they&#x27;re secretly good. &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; is so bad it crushes your spirit. It&#x27;s unfathomably terrible.&quot; The film was criticized for its inconsistent tone, complex narrative, and lack of faithfulness to the source material. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; is a mainstay on lists compiling the worst films of all time. It was voted the sixth worst film of all time by RiffTrax in 2012, and &quot;IGN&quot; ranked it among the &quot;best worst movies ever made&quot; in 2021. Author David Bodanis, in his 2020 book &quot;The Art of Fairness&quot;, called &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; &quot;the worst movie ever made&quot;.

In addition to scathing reviews, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; was a box-office bomb, and Morton and Jankel were &quot;blacklisted&quot; as directors in Hollywood. In a 2007 interview, Hoskins said: &quot;The worst thing I ever did? &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; It was a fuckin&#x27; nightmare. The whole experience was a nightmare. It had a husband-and-wife team directing, whose arrogance had been mistaken for talent. After so many weeks their own agent told them to get off the set! Fuckin&#x27; nightmare. Fuckin&#x27; idiots.&quot; In a 2011 interview, he was asked, &quot;What is the worst job you&#x27;ve done?&quot;, &quot;What has been your biggest disappointment?&quot;, and &quot;If you could edit your past, what would you change?&quot; His answer to all three was &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; The film made Nintendo wary of licensing its works to film studios, and it did not license &quot;Mario&quot; again until it collaborated with Illumination for &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023). Seth Rogen, who voiced Donkey Kong in the 2023 film, called &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; one of the worst films ever made and what &quot;made me realize that movies, like, could be bad. That never occurred to me until that moment.&quot;

=== &quot;North&quot; (1994) ===
The Rob Reiner film &quot;North&quot; is an adaptation of the novel &quot;North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents&quot; by Alan Zweibel, who also wrote the screenplay and has a minor role in the film. &quot;North&quot;, which stars Elijah Wood in the title role and also marked Scarlett Johansson&#x27;s film debut, was a critical and commercial failure, earning only $7,138,449 worldwide despite its budget of over $40 million. It was widely criticized for its plot, its all-star cast of insensitive characters, lack of humor and portrayal of numerous ethnic stereotypes (especially Alaskan Inuit). It has a 14% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave it zero stars and, in his review, infamously wrote, &quot;I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.&quot; He continued saying &quot;&quot;North&quot; is a bad film – one of the worst movies ever made&quot;, and it is also on his list of most hated films. Both Ebert and Gene Siskel named &quot;North&quot; as the worst film of 1994. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said in his review that &quot;&quot;North&quot; is director Rob Reiner&#x27;s first flat-out failure, a sincerely wrought, energetically made picture that all the same crashes on takeoff. It&#x27;s strange and oddly distasteful, at its best managing to be bad in some original and unexpected ways.&quot; Richard Roeper named &quot;North&quot; as one of the 40 worst movies he has ever seen, saying that, &quot;Of all the films on this list, &quot;North&quot; may be the most difficult to watch from start to finish.&quot; The film was nominated for the following awards at the 15th Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Bruce Willis, also for &quot;Color of Night&quot;), Worst Supporting Actress (Kathy Bates), Worst Supporting Actor (Dan Aykroyd, also for &quot;Exit to Eden&quot;), Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay (Andrew Scheinman and Alan Zweibel).

=== &quot;Dis – en historie om kjærlighet&quot; (&quot;A Story About Love&quot;) (1995) ===

The Norwegian romantic film &quot;Dis – en historie om kjærlighet&quot; was directed by Aune Sand. The film follows different couples and their love stories around the world, in Cairo, Normandy, Oslo and New York City. &quot;Dis&quot; received universally poor reviews by critics, and has been called the most poorly reviewed Norwegian film in history. Critic Harald Kolstad of &quot;Dagsavisen&quot; gave it a score of zero, refused to acknowledge &quot;Dis&quot; as a film, and claimed to have never seen anything worse. &quot;Aftenposten&quot; referred to the film as &quot;the largest turkey&quot; and &quot;the most reviled film&quot;, and &quot;Total Film&quot; included it on its list of the 66 worst films ever made. Despite being a critical disaster it became a commercial success, gaining cult film status with a following akin to &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, with fans embracing its &quot;so bad it&#x27;s good&quot; qualities. Director Aune Sand insists that &quot;Dis&quot; is a masterpiece.

=== &quot;Showgirls&quot; (1995) ===
Hype for Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s erotic drama &quot;Showgirls&quot; focused on the sex and nudity in this NC-17 French-American film with a $45 million budget, but the final result was critically derided. Much hype revolved around the film&#x27;s star, Elizabeth Berkley, who only two years before had starred in the lighthearted and chaste teen sitcom &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;. The film won seven Razzie Awards, a record at that time, and received 13 nominations, a record that still stands. It received an additional award at the 20th Golden Raspberry Awards, where it was awarded Worst Picture of the Decade. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it, &quot;a film of thunderous oafishness that gives adult subject matter the kind of bad name it does not need or deserve&quot;. Michael Dequina of TheMovieReport.com also criticized the film, claiming that it was &quot;the best bad filmmaking Hollywood has to offer&quot;. Adam White wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; that it was &quot;the worst movie ever made&quot; but also a masterpiece. Stephen Lynch of the &quot;Knight Ridder/Tribune&quot; similarly named it the worst movie ever made, calling it &quot;so bad it may be brilliant&quot;. Various sources have since included &quot;Showgirls&quot; in their respective lists of the worst films ever made, including: Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and &quot;Flavorwire&quot;. &quot;Showgirls&quot; was also featured in Michael Sauter&#x27;s &quot;The Worst Movies of All Time&quot; as well as &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot;. Despite being a critical failure and failing at the box office initially, &quot;Showgirls&quot; found success as a camp cult film, particularly among the LGBT community, but whether the film was intended to be satirical remains subject to debate. On the home video market, the film was MGM&#x27;s most profitable release for years.

=== &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (1995) ===

A &quot;freely adapted&quot; version of the 1850 romantic novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne, directed by Roland Joffé and starring Demi Moore and Gary Oldman. The film met with universally negative reviews and was a box-office bomb, grossing $10.4 million against a production budget of $46 million. Multiple critics named the film the worst of 1995.

Chris Hicks of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; argued that its deviation from the source material represents &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s arrogance in its purest form&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Amy E. Schwartz reported that the &quot;nutty&quot; film was described by numerous reviewers as the worst they had ever seen. Kevin Williamson of &quot;National Review&quot; observed a &quot;combination of awfulness and inexplicability&quot;, and claimed that &quot;any objective and authoritative analysis will reveal that the worst film ever made is Demi Moore&#x27;s version of &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;&quot;. Sadie Trombetta of &quot;Bustle&quot; wrote that it &quot;has earned an almost permanent spot on every &#x27;Worst Movie of All Time&#x27; list&quot;, while author Libby Fischer Hellmann noted that it is &quot;widely cited as the worst film adaptation ever made&quot;. The film was nominated for seven Golden Raspberry Awards, winning &quot;Worst Remake or Sequel&quot;. Furthermore, Roger Ebert placed the film on his &quot;most hated&quot; list.

===&quot;Bio-Dome&quot; (1996)===

The 1996 comedy film &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; focuses on two moronic stoner best friends, played by Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin, who accidentally get trapped inside of the Bio-Dome owned by Henry Gibson, a hermetically sealed ecological system, after mistaking it for a mall while looking for a bathroom.

For MTV News, Eric Snider wrote in 2008 that &quot;nothing can account for...the movie &quot;Bio-Dome&quot;, which is–and I do not make this assertion lightly–the worst crime ever perpetrated against humanity throughout all of recorded history&quot;. Snider went on to call it &quot;quite bad&quot; and &quot;certainly one of the worst comedies&quot; he had ever seen, criticizing Pauly Shore&#x27;s performance as unfunny and the film&#x27;s writing as stupid. Syfy Wire″s Cassidy Ward described &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; as &quot;one of the best-worst movies of all time&quot;, stating that its plot &quot;strains credulity&quot;, while Jon O&#x27;Brien of &quot;Inverse&quot; called it &quot;one of the worst movies ever made&quot; and wrote that it &quot;has nothing to offer but unconvincing pratfalls...tumbleweed one-liners...and some unashamed sexism, too&quot;. It was described as &quot;almost unwatchably awful&quot; and &quot;a baffling piece of work&quot; by Charles Bramesco of &quot;Uproxx&quot;, who wrote that it was a &quot;perennial contender in the battle for the title of Worst Movie Ever&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Nathan Rabin wrote, &quot;Critics and audiences alike found the &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; to be an abomination unto the Lord, an affront to the gods of cinema, and also a very bad movie, bad enough to be considered the gold standard of crapitude in Shore&#x27;s oeuvre,&quot; noting that it had the lowest Metacritic score of any movie, with 1 out of 100. &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; was named one of the worst movies of the 1990s in a poll conducted by RiffTrax.

Kylie Minogue, who starred in the film as oceanographer Petra von Kant, called appearing in the film the worst decision of her career. For his performance in the movie, Shore won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor at the 17th Golden Raspberry Awards, tying with Tom Arnold for his performance in &quot;Big Bully&quot;.

=== &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997) ===
&quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; is a superhero film based on the DC character Batman and is the fourth and final installment of the Burton/Schumacher Batman film series. It is directed by Joel Schumacher and stars George Clooney as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, Chris O&#x27;Donnell as Robin/Dick Grayson, Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl/Barbara Wilson and Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth. This film was largely criticized for its toyetic and camp approach, and Mr. Freeze&#x27;s approach and one-line jokes.

, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 11% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 89 reviews, certifying it &quot;Rotten&quot; with an average rating of 3.7/10, and the critics&#x27; consensus: &quot;Joel Schumacher&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, resulting in a frantic and mindless movie that&#x27;s too jokey to care much for.&quot; By comparison Metacritic collected an average score of 28/100, based on 21 reviews. Michael J. Nelson, of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; fame, wrote of the movie in his book, &quot;Movie Megacheese&quot;, &quot;&quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; is not the worst movie ever. No, indeed. It&#x27;s the worst thing ever. Yes, it&#x27;s the single worst thing that we as human beings have ever produced in recorded history.&quot; &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; also came in first in an &quot;Empire&quot; poll of the 50 worst films ever. Joel Schumacher apologized to disappointed fans on the 2005 DVD release of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. In 2021, Clooney stated that he refused to let his wife watch the film, saying, &quot;There are certain films I just go, &#x27;I want my wife to have some respect for me&#x27;&quot;. Clooney however would reprise his role as Bruce Wayne from the film in 2023&#x27;s &quot;The Flash&quot;.

=== &quot;Le Jour et la Nuit&quot; (&quot;The Day and the Night&quot;) (1997) ===

The French romance film &quot;Le Jour et la Nuit&quot; was directed by philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy. It follows a French author who fled to Mexico for a quiet life and an actress who is willing to seduce him to get a part in a film adapted from one of his books. Before its release, &quot;Le Jour et la Nuit&quot; was heavily promoted in many French newspapers and magazines. When the film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1997, hundreds of journalists walked out of the screening and those that stayed ridiculed it. Following its release, &quot;Le Jour et la Nuit&quot; was harshly criticized by the French media, with overwhelmingly negative reviews appearing in publications such as &quot;Libération&quot;, &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot;. The film also did poorly commercially, with only 73,147 seats for &quot;Le Jour et la Nuit&quot; having been sold two months after its release. &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; called it an &quot;Absolute debacle&quot; and Michel Houellebecq referred to it as the &quot;most preposterous film in history&quot;. &quot;Le Jour et la Nuit&quot; was considered the worst French film since 1945 by film magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, and its status as the &quot;worst film in history&quot; was discussed by the French version of &quot;Slate&quot;. Likewise, English-language film site &quot;/Film&quot; described its status as &quot;one of the worst foreign language movies ever made&quot;, and filmmaker Claude Chabrol selected it as one of the worst movies ever made. An original documentary, &quot;Anatomy of a Massacre&quot;, was released with the &quot;Le Jour et la Nuit&quot; DVD, and focused on its intense negative reception and failure.

=== &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1998) ===

An adaptation of the popular 1960s British TV series of the same name, &quot;The Avengers&quot; starred Ralph Fiennes as John Steed and Uma Thurman as Emma Peel, with Sean Connery as their antagonist, Sir August de Wynter. It was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. &quot;The Avengers&quot; began to receive negative publicity after Warner Bros., the film&#x27;s distributor, refused to allow any early press-screenings for movie reviewers. After early test screenings, &quot;The Avengers&quot; was heavily edited by the studio. On its release, &quot;The Avengers&quot; was savaged by film critics, with the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; stating &quot;&quot;The Avengers&quot; is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made&quot; and adding that one reviewer had joked the film was such a &quot;turkey&quot; that the makers should have handed distribution to the poultry chain Bernard Matthews. Several reviewers disparaged &quot;The Avengers&quot; for lacking the wit and excitement of its source material. Janet Maslin strongly criticized &quot;The Avengers&quot;: &quot;With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers blush and with so many shades of &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; that one scene depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference table, it&#x27;s a film to gall fans of the old TV series and perplex anyone else. I can&#x27;t remember another Friday morning show where I heard actual cries of &quot;Ugh!&quot; on the way out the door&quot; and finished her review with, &quot;At a pared-down, barely rational 100 minutes, &quot;The Avengers&quot; is short but not short enough.&quot;

David Bianculli said, &quot;This &quot;Avengers&quot; film is so horrendously, painfully and thoroughly awful, it gives other cinematic clunkers like &quot;Ishtar&quot; and &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; a good name.&quot; Alan Jones in &quot;The Radio Times&quot; stated &quot;The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that&#x27;s stunningly awful in every other department ... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone&#x27;s time and energy.&quot; &quot;The Avengers&quot; also shared a Razzie Award for &quot;Worst Remake or Sequel&quot; with the 1998 adaptations of &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot; at the 19th Golden Raspberry Awards. &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine later voted Fiennes and Thurman in &quot;The Avengers&quot; as &quot;The Worst Movie Double Act Of All Time&quot;. The film also appeared on Metacritic&#x27;s list of the all-time lowest-scoring films.

=== &quot;Fatal Deviation&quot; (1998) ===

&quot;Fatal Deviation&quot; is often credited as being the first martial arts film to be filmed in Ireland. It stars martial artist James Bennett and Michael Graham, who is best known for being a member of the boy band Boyzone. &quot;The Irish Post&quot; and &quot;Den of Geek&quot; write that it is a mainstay of worst film lists. Luke McKinney of Cracked.com called it the worst film ever made, writing: &quot;There are so many things about making a movie that Jimmy doesn&#x27;t know, that you could replace film school with this movie alone--just screening it once for students and asking them to list all the things it did wrong. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t write &#x27;everything&#x27; instantly fails.&quot; &quot;The Irish Post&quot; named it the worst Irish film of all time, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; wrote that it is &quot;regarded as one of the worst films ever made&quot; and Comic Book Resources called it &quot;one of the worst commercial movies ever made&quot;. Entertainment.ie placed it on its list of &quot;10 So Bad They&#x27;re Good Movies You Need To See Before You Die&quot; and it was covered in &quot;Paste&quot;″s &quot;Bad Movie Diaries&quot; column.

=== &quot;Parting Shots&quot; (1999) ===

The British black comedy &quot;Parting Shots&quot; was the last film directed by Michael Winner. It starred rock musician Chris Rea as a man who, after being told he has only six months to live, begins murdering people who have wronged him. Andrew Collins took a very negative view of the film: &quot;&quot;Parting Shots&quot; ... is going to set the course of British film-making back 20 years. It is not only the worst British film produced in this country since &quot;Carry On Emmannuelle&quot; (quite a feat in itself), it is a thoroughbred contender for the crown of Worst Film Ever Made.&quot; In an interview about the film, Charlotte O&#x27;Sullivan, the &quot;Independent&quot;&#x27;s film editor, claimed &quot;Parting Shots&quot; was &quot;the worst film I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. O&#x27;Sullivan also criticized it for glorifying vigilantism: &quot;It&#x27;s Michael Winner and you know, he doesn&#x27;t have any sense of irony. He seems to be saying it is okay to go and kill people.&quot; The journalist Miles Kington later claimed &quot;&quot;Parting Shots&quot; ... was directed by Michael Winner and despite the glittering cast, was possibly the worst film ever made.&quot; I. Q. Hunter listed &quot;Parting Shots&quot; as one of the candidates for &quot;the Worst British film ever made&quot;. &quot;Parting Shots&quot; was also featured in a poll of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine readers&#x27; &quot;50 Worst Movies Ever&quot; poll.

=== &quot;The Underground Comedy Movie&quot; (1999) ===

&quot;The Underground Comedy Movie&quot; is based on a cable access show from 1988. Director and lead actor Vince Offer constructed the film out of a series of tasteless, lowbrow skits (including Gena Lee Nolin loudly using the restroom and a superhero named &quot;Dickman&quot; who dresses in a giant penis costume and defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen). In 1999, Offer filed a suit against 20th Century Fox and the co-directors of &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; (1998), Bobby and Peter Farrelly, claiming that 14 scenes in &quot;Mary&quot; were stolen from his film. The Farrellys released this statement: &quot;We&#x27;ve never heard of him, we&#x27;ve never heard of his movie, and it&#x27;s all a bunch of baloney.&quot; Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to it as a &quot;wretched film&quot; and stated that &quot;&quot;The Underground Comedy Movie&quot; stands as a monument to ineptitude and self-delusion.&quot; Rod Dreher of the &quot;New York Post&quot; said it &quot;may be the least amusing comedy ever made&quot;. Dave Shulman of &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; described it as a &quot;serious contender for the single worst movie ever made&quot;, while Stinkers Bad Movie Awards co-founder Mike Lancaster said that it was the worst film that he had ever paid to see. Nathan Rabin covered the film in his column detailing terrible films and stated that: &quot;nothing I&#x27;ve covered for this column was quite as soul-crushingly, brain-meltingly terrible as ... &quot;The Underground Comedy Movie&quot;.&quot; Thom Bennett at &quot;Film Journal International&quot;, wrote &quot;Anyone offended by unbearably bad films, jokes that are not funny and wasting 90 minutes of their lives is, as promised, guaranteed to be offended. In fact, to even call this mess a comedy is giving it far too much credit&quot;, and &quot;&quot;The Underground Comedy Movie&quot; may well be the worst film I have ever seen.&quot; Writing in &quot;Central Western Daily&quot;, Peter Young said, &quot;I am pretty sure that I can declare this The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen.&quot;

== 2000s ==

=== &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; (2000) ===

&quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; is based on the first half of L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s 1982 novel of the same name, and stars John Travolta, Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker. Although a sequel covering the second half of the book was planned, the panning from critics, poor box-office performance, and financial ruin of Franchise Pictures killed off such plans. It was criticized for a poor script, hammy acting, overuse of Dutch angles, repetitive dialogue, and several inconsistencies and plot holes. The movie&#x27;s producer, Franchise Pictures, was later forced out of business after it emerged that it had fraudulently overstated the film&#x27;s budget by $31 million. It has a 3% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, where it is included in the top 100 worst-reviewed movies of all time. Roger Ebert predicted that the film, &quot;for decades to come will be the punch line of jokes about bad movies&quot;. Ebert also wrote, &quot;The director, Roger Christian, has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why&quot;. It is also on his &quot;most hated&quot; list. Nathan Rabin covered the film as part of his &quot;My World of Flops&quot; column for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, calling it &quot;a fiasco that occupies a distinguished place high atop the pantheon of widely reviled crap&quot; and said, &quot;A legendary disaster well before it finished completion, &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; hit theaters with a &quot;Kick Me&quot; sign on it so massive it could be detected from outer space.&quot;

It won seven Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture and Worst Screen Couple (John Travolta and &quot;anyone on the screen with him&quot;). In 2005, an eighth Razzie (for Worst &quot;Drama&quot; of Our First 25 Years) was awarded to the film, and in 2010 it won a ninth Razzie at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards for &quot;Worst Picture of the Decade&quot;. Listing the film as one of the worst decisions in movie history, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; quipped that, &quot;If Earth sticks around long enough for the Golden Raspberry Awards to hand out a &quot;worst movie of the century&quot; at their 2100 ceremony, it&#x27;ll probably win that, too.&quot; It won more Razzies than any film in the history of the awards at the time, until &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; surpassed its record with 10 wins in 2012.

The movie appeared on Metacritic&#x27;s list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and is on the Movie Review Query Engine&#x27;s (MRQE) 50 Worst Movies list, as well as worst film lists from &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Flavorwire&quot;, &quot;Digital Trends&quot; and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; named it the second worst movie ever made after &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; and &quot;The Register&quot; listed it as the worst movie ever made. Pepper and Whitaker both expressed regret for their involvement in &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;, while film screenwriter J. David Shapiro later apologized for making &quot;the suckiest movie ever&quot;.

===&quot;Titanic: The Legend Goes On&quot; (2000)===

&quot;Titanic: The Legend Goes On&quot; (also known as &quot;Titanic, mille e una storia&quot;, &quot;Titanic: La leggenda continua&quot; and &quot;Titanic: The Animated Movie&quot;) is an Italian animated mockbuster about the sinking of the . It features a similar romantic storyline to James Cameron&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Titanic&quot; film, but also has a number of talking animals (most notably, a rapping dog). Reviews condemned the quality of the animation and criticized the plot for being insensitive to the memory of the victims of the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

&quot;Total Film&quot; named &quot;Titanic: The Legend Goes On&quot; as &quot;officially the worst film ever made&quot;, after it topped a list of the 66 worst films ever. An article from &quot;Collider&quot; also described it as one of the worst films ever made, but notes that it &quot;[lacks] the cult following that other bad films often acquire,&quot; stating: &quot;&quot;Titanic: The Legend Goes On&quot; is too heinous for such fond pleasures.&quot; Critic Tim Brayton said that &quot;It is one of the most surreally bad films I have ever encountered&quot;, adding: &quot;For sheer mesmerising grotesqueness, there&#x27;s almost nothing I can name that beats it, and no fan of bad movies can say that their life is complete till they&#x27;ve been exposed to it.&quot; &quot;Total Film&quot; also included the film on a list of the worst kids&#x27; movies, describing it as being &quot;widely considered one of the worst animated films ever made&quot;, while Spanish film magazine &quot;Fotogramas&quot; selected it as one of the 20 worst films ever made. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included it on a list of the 12 worst animated films of all time, and it topped a &quot;Showbiz Cheat Sheet&quot; list of the top 10 worst animated films ever, with author Will Roberts commenting that &quot;[any] list of the worst animated films of all time begins with ... &quot;Titanic: The Legend Goes On&quot;&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Titanic: The Legend Goes On&quot; became the lowest-rated film on IMDb&#x27;s Bottom 100 list.

=== &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; (2001) ===

The comedy film &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; stars Tom Green, who also wrote and directed it, featuring largely gross-out and shock humor similar to that featured in &quot;The Tom Green Show&quot;. In the film, Green stars as a 28-year-old slacker and cartoonist who falsely accuses his father of child molestation when he questions his son&#x27;s life goals. &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; received overwhelmingly negative reviews, with CNN critic Paul Clinton declaring it &quot;quite simply the worst movie ever released by a major studio in Hollywood history.&quot; Warren Epstein of &quot;The Gazette&quot; described &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; as &quot;the worst movie ever made&quot;. A review in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said: &quot;If ever a movie testified to the utter creative bankruptcy of the Hollywood film industry, it is the abomination known as &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot;.&quot; Roger Ebert included the film on his &quot;most hated&quot; list, gave it zero out of four stars and wrote: &quot;This movie doesn&#x27;t scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn&#x27;t the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn&#x27;t below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn&#x27;t deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.&quot;

&quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; was nominated for eight awards at the 2001 Razzies, and won for Worst Picture, Worst Actor, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, and Worst On-Screen Couple. Razzies founder John J. B. Wilson called it &quot;offensive, stupid and obnoxious&quot; and said it had &quot;no redeeming value&quot;. Green accepted his awards in person, traveling to the ceremony in a white Cadillac, wearing a tuxedo and rolling out his own red carpet to the presentation. The movie has an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2010, the film was nominated at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture of the Decade, though it lost to &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;. &quot;Freddy Got Fingered&quot; also appeared on Metacritic&#x27;s list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, was featured in &quot;Empire&quot; list of the 50 Worst Movies Ever poll, and is on the MRQE&#x27;s 50 Worst Movies list.

=== &quot;Glitter&quot; (2001) ===
Starring Mariah Carey in the lead role as an aspiring singer in 1980s New York City, the romantic musical drama &quot;Glitter&quot; was intended to be her breakthrough role but was a critical failure and a box-office bomb. &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; claimed that &quot;Glitter&quot; &quot;was slammed by almost all critics for being the worst film ever&quot;. &quot;Fade In&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Glitter&quot; isn&#x27;t just one of the worst music-themed films ever — it&#x27;s one of the worst films ever made, period.&quot; Author Bob McCann wrote in &quot;Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television&quot; that it&#x27;s &quot;rightfully in the running as one of the worst films ever made&quot;. News.com.au, &quot;Hi&quot;, &quot;Flavorwire&quot;, &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Metacritic, and &quot;Empire&quot; are amongst those who have listed it as one of the worst films ever made.

&quot;Glitter&quot; received six Razzie nominations, and Carey won for Worst Actress. It was also featured in &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot;, and in 2005, it was nominated for &quot;Worst Musical of Our First 25 Years&quot;, but lost to &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot;. In an interview in 2010, Carey stated that she believed that the film&#x27;s failure at the box office was largely due to the soundtrack being released the same day as the September 11 attacks. It has a 6% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 87 reviews.

=== &quot;Swept Away&quot; (2002) ===
A remake of a 1974 Italian film of the same name, the romantic comedy film &quot;Swept Away&quot; was directed by Guy Ritchie and starred his then-wife Madonna and Adriano Giannini. It received overwhelmingly negative reviews, with most of the criticism going towards Madonna&#x27;s bad acting, the original film being considered superior and the remake being considered just a star vehicle for Madonna. Rex Reed of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; said: &quot;If there is one thing worse than a Guy Ritchie movie, it&#x27;s a Guy Ritchie movie with Madonna in it.&quot; &quot;Newsday&quot; critic John Anderson said, &quot;New ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is.&quot; Joe Queenan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; discussed the movie in an article on what makes a movie the worst of all time and said, &quot;[...] &quot;Showgirls&quot; has a certain campy allure that grows a bit each time I see it. Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Swept Away&quot; doesn&#x27;t; it seems more amateurish on each viewing, like a morass that starts out as a quagmire, then morphs into a cesspool and finally turns into a slime pit on the road to its ultimate destination in the bowels of Hell.&quot; Julie Burchill, also from &quot;The Guardian&quot;, selected it as her pick for the worst film ever made.

&quot;Swept Away&quot; was also a box-office bomb; against a $10 million budget, it grossed $598,645 in the United States and around $437,875 from foreign territories for a worldwide total gross of $1,036,520. It received five awards at the 23rd Golden Raspberry Awards and became the first film to win both Worst Picture and Worst Remake or Sequel. At the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards, it was nominated for Worst &quot;Drama&quot; of Our First 25 Years, and at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards, it was nominated for Worst Picture of the Decade, but &#x27;lost&#x27; to &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; at both ceremonies. &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it #20 in its list of &quot;The 50 Worst Movies Ever&quot;, and After Ellen ranked it #7 in its list of &quot;The worst movies ever to grace the screen&quot;.

=== &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; (2002) ===

The comedy film &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; was produced in part by Adam Sandler and stars Dana Carvey as Pistachio Disguisey, an undercover Italian waiter who must save his father Fabbrizio (James Brolin) from the evil Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) by using his inherent skills in disguise. Although the film was a box office success, it received scathing reviews from critics upon its release, many of which pointed out its sophomoric plot, unfunny humor (in particular, its flatulence gags) and disguises that would clearly not be recognized by children (such as Tony Montana from &quot;Scarface&quot;). Many critics also pointed out the short running time, consisting of 72 minutes of the film itself and over ten minutes of end credits juxtaposed with outtakes, including two post credit scenes. Roger Ebert gave it one star out of four, claiming, &quot;The movie is a desperate miscalculation. It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny, and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time.&quot; Alan Morrison, writing for &quot;Empire&quot;, proclaimed that &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; was &quot;the worst film ever made: a film about idiots, made by idiots, for idiots&quot;, while Matthew Turner of &quot;ViewLondon&quot; remarked, &quot;This is a serious contender for the title of The Worst Film Ever Made.&quot; The film holds a 1% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 104 reviews, and is featured on the site&#x27;s list of the top 100 worst-reviewed films of all time. It also appears on Metacritic&#x27;s list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and is on the MRQE&#x27;s 50 Worst Movies list. A cameo appearance by Bo Derek landed her a nomination for Worst Supporting Actress at the 23rd Golden Raspberry Awards, but she lost to Madonna for &quot;Die Another Day&quot;.

=== &quot;Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever&quot; (2002) ===

The action film &quot;Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever&quot; stars Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu as opposing secret agents. Critics panned it, generally regarding it as having no redeeming features, not even the unintentional comedic value normally associated with bad films. They variously described the film as &quot;A picture for idiots&quot;, &quot;Boring to an amazing degree&quot;, &quot;A fine achievement in stupidity and dullness&quot;, &quot;Dreadful&quot;, &quot;[Giving] new meaning to the word incoherent&quot;, and &quot;bad on just about every level&quot;. One critic suggested an alternative title as &quot;Simplistic: Bullets Vs. Humans&quot;.

Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;You could run this film backward, soundtrack included, and it would make no less sense.&quot; Roger Ebert called the movie &quot;a chaotic mess, overloaded with special effects and explosions, light on continuity, sanity and coherence.&quot; In addition to being lambasted by critics, it was a disaster financially, recouping just over $19.9 million of its $70 million budget. In March 2007, Rotten Tomatoes ranked it #1 among &quot;The Worst of the Worst&quot; movie list, with 108 &quot;rotten&quot; reviews and no &quot;fresh&quot; ones. &quot;Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever&quot; remains the worst reviewed film on Rotten Tomatoes, as it is at the top of their 100 Worst Films of All time list. &quot;Mental Floss&quot; has also nominated it as the worst movie ever made and Ebert included it in his &quot;most hated&quot; list.

=== &quot;Ben and Arthur&quot; (2002) ===

A low-budget 2002 American romantic drama film about the titular gay couple who come into conflict with Arthur&#x27;s religious brother, &quot;Ben and Arthur&quot; was written, directed, produced, edited, and scored by Sam Mraovich, who also played the character Arthur. &quot;Ben and Arthur&quot; received strong criticism (especially from the LGBT community) for its low budget and poor plotting. BuzzFeed described it as the &quot;worst gay movie of all time&quot;. The gay popular culture site Queerty described &quot;Ben and Arthur&quot; as &quot;unintelligible&quot; and ended its review by calling it the &quot;Worst. Movie. Ever.&quot; The gay movie review site Cinemaqueer likewise stated: &quot;&quot;Ben and Arthur&quot; is so terrible that it has awoken the dormant Bette Davis in me. It is so painfully bad that it wouldn&#x27;t even make good fodder on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. This just might possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen ... Unless you get a kick out of mocking bad films, avoid this one at all costs.&quot; Michael Adams, reviewing the film for his book &quot;Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies&quot;, describes it thus: &quot;&quot;Ben &amp; Arthur&quot; is as over-the-top insane as it is ludicrously executed ... the production values, from biscuits on plates comprising the main course of a candlelit dinner to a church literally having a cardboard cross and a cartoon Jesus on the wall, are as bad as anything I&#x27;ve seen.&quot; A Rotten Tomatoes article placed &quot;Ben and Arthur&quot; on their list of &quot;Films So Bad They&#x27;re Unmissable&quot;, saying &quot;If Tommy Wiseau&#x27;s &quot;The Room&quot; is the over-wrought, melodramatic and self-pitying heterosexual camp classic of choice, then Sam Mraovich&#x27;s &quot;Ben &amp; Arthur&quot; is its gay equivalent.&quot; Rotten Tomatoes also stated &quot;Every scene, every line, every hissy fit is simultaneously hilariously amateur and hysterically fever-pitched.&quot; &quot;Total Film&quot; ranked &quot;Ben and Arthur&quot; at No. 58 in their list of the 66 worst films of all time. Mraovich finds &quot;Ben and Arthur&quot;″s placement among the canon of worst films to be a blessing as the film has received more attention than he ever anticipated.

=== &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot; (2003) ===

The romantic-comedy musical &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot; stars Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, the winner and runner-up, respectively, of the first season of &quot;American Idol&quot;. The film was a critical and commercial disaster, earning only $4.9 million at the North American box office and achieving a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 63 reviews. Josh Tyrangiel of &quot;Time Magazine&quot; described &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot; as &quot;a monstrous &quot;Idol&quot; movie musical that in the most generous light is the worst film so far this century&quot;, while &quot;The Free Lance–Star&quot; referred to it as &quot;the world&#x27;s worst movie&quot;. Nathan Rabin, reviewing the film for his &quot;My Year of Flops&quot; series, stated, &quot;All films require suspension of disbelief. &quot;From Justin To Kelly&quot; requires something more like a temporary lobotomy. Nothing about the main characters or their relationships makes sense.&quot; It won a special Razzie—&quot;Governor&#x27;s Award – Distinguished Under-Achievement in Choreography&quot;—at the 24th Golden Raspberry Awards. It was nominated for eight additional Razzies (including a second special award, &quot;Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie&quot;), and a year later it won for Worst &quot;Musical&quot; of Our First 25 Years. &quot;Total Film&quot;, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; and &quot;Digital Trends&quot; included &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot; on their worst film lists. In a later interview, Clarkson expressed regret over &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot;, stating she only did it because she was contractually obligated to do so: &quot;I knew when I read the script it was going to be real, real bad, but when I won, I signed that piece of paper, and I could not get out of it.&quot;

=== &quot;The Room&quot; (2003) ===
The independently produced &quot;The Room&quot;, about an amiable banker whose friends betray him one by one, has been called &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of bad movies&quot; by some critics. &quot;The Guardian, Vox, The Washington Post, ABC Australia&quot; and &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; called it the worst film ever made. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it &quot;the greatest bad movie of our time&quot; and said, &quot;&quot;The Room&quot; is nearly an anti-film—an inane and unintentionally surreal soap opera, filled with non-sequiturs, confused characters, and gratuitous, anatomically incorrect sex.&quot; Though the film&#x27;s star, writer, producer, and director Tommy Wiseau has claimed it is a black comedy and its numerous flaws are intentional, other actors involved in the production have denied this, saying that Wiseau intended it as a melodramatic romance.

&quot;The Room&quot; has been noted for its bizarre and non-sequiturial dialogue, protracted sex scenes, various subplots that are inadequately resolved or simply disappear altogether (most notably, a character announces that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer, but this is never mentioned again throughout the entire film), and infamous use of green-screen for &quot;outdoor&quot; rooftop scenes. It made its broadcast premiere as an April Fools&#x27; Day special in 2009 on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim block, edited down from its original R rating to a TV-14/DSLV rating; it would prove so popular the network continued to air the film on April 1 as a tradition for several years, to the point the 2012 prank for the network consisted of playing the first few minutes before suddenly cutting off for an unannounced one-night revival of their Toonami block, with block host T.O.M first greeting the audience as Wiseau&#x27;s character does, declaring &quot;Oh, hai, Adult Swim&quot;. The day after its appearance, its DVD became the top-selling independent film on Amazon.com. In June 2010, &quot;The Room&quot; started playing at the American Film Institute Silver Theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland. &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; alumni Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett produced an audio commentary track to accompany the movie through their site RiffTrax.com. In 2013, the book &quot;The Disaster Artist&quot;, written by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell, was published; the book is Sestero&#x27;s memoir of his involvement in the production of the movie. The book was adapted into the Oscar-nominated film of the same name, directed by and starring James Franco as Wiseau (winning a Best Actor Golden Globe Award for his performance) and his brother Dave Franco as Sestero. A remake starring Bob Odenkirk was set to be released in June 2023 to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the film&#x27;s release, but was delayed.

=== &quot;Gigli&quot; (2003) ===

The Martin Brest movie &quot;Gigli&quot; features Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, with appearances by Al Pacino and Christopher Walken. &quot;Gigli&quot; was originally a black comedy with no romantic subplot, but the producers demanded script rewrites throughout filming, hoping to cash in on the Lopez–Affleck romance that was then big news in celebrity-watching publications such as &quot;Us&quot; and &quot;People&quot;. This film cost $54 million to make but grossed only $6 million, making it one of the biggest box-office bombs of all time. &quot;The Times&quot; gave the film a zero, making &quot;Gigli&quot; the lowest-scored film review in the publication&#x27;s history at that time. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated that it was &quot;[t]he worst movie—all right, the worst allegedly major movie—of our admittedly young century&quot;, while Roger Friedman of Fox News claimed it was &quot;[t]he worst movie ever made&quot;. It was also the winner of seven Razzies (including 2005&#x27;s Worst &quot;Comedy&quot; of Our First 25 Years), and in 2010 the film was nominated at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards for &quot;Worst Picture of the Decade&quot;. It is in Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; Top 100 worst-reviewed movies of the 2000s, where it has a 6% rating. &quot;AfterEllen&quot; ranked &quot;Gigli&quot; number 1 in its list of the worst films of all time. &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, and &quot;Digital Trends&quot; also listed it as one of the worst films ever made.

=== &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; (2004) ===

The 2004 British sex comedy &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; is about the sex lives of a group of potato delivery men in Birmingham. The film received strongly hostile reviews from the British media. Reviews claimed &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; was unfunny, disgusting, and depressing. Writing in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, film critic Kevin O&#x27;Sullivan called &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; &quot;one of the worst films ever made&quot;. Novelist Will Self, in his review for &quot;The Evening Standard&quot;, called &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; &quot;mirthless, worthless, toothless, useless&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; reviewer James Christopher dubbed &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; &quot;one of the two most nauseous films ever made ... a masterclass in film-making ineptitude&quot;. The &quot;Sunday Express&quot; film critic, Henry Fitzherbert, also strongly condemned the film: &quot;&quot;Sex Lives&quot; is so awful it left me slack-jawed in disbelief ... it must be one of the worst British comedies.&quot; Catherine Shoard, in a critique in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, stated &quot;It&#x27;s hard to know what to say to this – it&#x27;s like finding the right words at a nasty accident ... &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; is probably the lewdest Brit-com since &quot;Confessions of a Window Cleaner&quot;, and certainly the worst.&quot; Shoard also described the film as &quot;Less a film than an appetite suppressant.&quot; Alan Morrison in the Scottish &quot;Daily Record&quot; described it as &quot;puerile smut of the very worst kind ... &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; should never have been made&quot;. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; later noted that &quot;&quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; attracted some of the worst reviews in living memory.&quot; &quot;The Birmingham Post&quot; described &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; as &quot;quite possibly the worst film ever made&quot;, while &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; stated that the film was &quot;a strong contender for the title of worst film of all time&quot;. It was also featured in &quot;Empire&quot;″s &quot;50 Worst Movies Ever&quot; poll. The film has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 14 reviews.

=== &quot;Catwoman&quot; (2004) ===
Nominally based on the DC Comics character, &quot;Catwoman&quot; stars Halle Berry as the title character. The film was the result of various rewrites by a total of 28 different screenwriters, though only four were credited after arbitration with the Writers Guild of America. It has a 9% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and was declared &quot;arguably the worst superhero film ever made&quot; by the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;. Jean Lowerison of the &quot;San Diego Metropolitan&quot; said in her review that &quot;Catwoman&quot; &quot;goes on my &#x27;worst&#x27; list for the year, and quite possibly for all time&quot;. Sadaf Ahsan of the &quot;National Post&quot; went further, calling it the worst movie ever made. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; summed up reviews of the film under the title &quot;Me-Ouch&quot;. The movie was the winner of four Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Director (Pitof) and Worst Screenplay. Berry arrived at the ceremony to accept her Razzie in person (with her Best Actress Oscar for &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot; in hand), saying: &quot;First of all, I want to thank Warner Bros. Thank you for putting me in a piece of shit, god-awful movie ... It was just what my career needed.&quot; Roger Ebert included it in his &quot;most hated&quot; list, being joined by &quot;Screen Rant&quot; and &quot;Flavorwire&quot;, who also included it in their worst film lists.

=== &quot;Daniel – Der Zauberer&quot; (&quot;Daniel – The Wizard&quot;) (2004) ===

The German film &quot;Daniel – Der Zauberer&quot; was directed by Ulli Lommel and stars pop singer and ex-&quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot; contestant Daniel Küblböck, who appeared as a fictionalized version of himself. &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; wrote that it is considered to be the worst German film, while n-tv said it was &quot;possibly the worst movie ever made&quot;. The website &quot;filmstarts.de&quot; states that &quot;Daniel – Der Zauberer&quot; was &quot;unbearable for non-fans of Küblböck&quot;, adding that &quot;the performances of the actors were some of the worst in the history of German cinema&quot;, and alleging that Ulli Lommel and producer Peter Schamoni had &quot;damaged their reputation&quot;. Years after its release, Küblböck admitted that, in retrospect, &quot;[Y]ou have to say this is the worst movie of all time really&quot;.

The film also performed extremely poorly at the box office, having only 13,834 viewers altogether, which led to it being withdrawn from screening at most cinemas within the first week, with &quot;RP Online&quot; referring to it as a &quot;super-flop&quot;. It is consistently listed at IMDb&#x27;s Bottom 100 list and became the lowest-rated film at one point. &quot;Total Film&quot; listed it as the third worst film of all time, after &quot;&quot; and the direct-to-video animated mockbuster &quot;&quot;, while &quot;Fotogramas&quot; and &quot;New York Daily News&quot; included it on their worst film lists. &quot;Filmstarts.de&quot; ranked it number 4 in its list of the 25 worst movies ever made, and on the German movie rating site &quot;Moviepilot.de&quot;, it is the lowest-rated film with an average rating of 0.4/10. In 2016, it was showcased on &quot;SchleFaZ&quot;, a German television show featuring the worst film ever made.

=== &quot;Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2&quot; (2004) ===

The family-oriented comedy &quot;Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2&quot; was the last film directed by Bob Clark (of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; fame) before his death. It is a sequel to the 1999 film &quot;Baby Geniuses&quot; and like its predecessor, it received negative reviews from film critics. Following the plot of the first film, four babies can communicate with each other using &#x27;baby talk&#x27;, and have knowledge of many secrets. The &quot;baby geniuses&quot; become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane (Jon Voight), a notorious kidnapper of children, who intends to use a satellite system to brainwash the world&#x27;s population and force them to watch TV for the rest of their lives.

The film was a box-office bomb, only receiving $9 million from its $20 million budget. &quot;MovieWeb&quot; writer B. Alan Orange considers it the worst movie ever made, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Joshua Rivera stated that it was the worst movie he had ever sat through, and Tom Long of &quot;The Deseret News&quot; said &quot;It is perhaps the most incompetent and least funny comic film ever made.&quot; It was nominated for four Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Picture, Worst Director (Bob Clark), Worst Supporting Actor (Jon Voight) and Worst Screenplay (Steven Paul (story) &amp; Gregory Poppen). &quot;Total Film&quot; named it the runner-up to &quot;&quot; in its list of the worst films ever made, and &quot;Mental Floss&quot; selected it as the second worst movie ever made after &quot;Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever&quot;. It was ranked as the worst sequel of all time by Rotten Tomatoes and, with a score of 0%, it is included in their list of the 100 Worst Movies of All Time.

=== &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; (2005) ===

Loosely based on a series of video games by Infogrames and directed by Uwe Boll, the German-Canadian-American film &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; was panned by critics for a multitude of reasons, including poor script and production values, quick cuts to optimize the gory content, almost no connection to the game, and bad acting. The movie received a 1% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, was the second worst reviewed movie of the 2000s, and appears in their top 100 worst-reviewed movies list. It appeared on Metacritic&#x27;s list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, which they gave a 9/100 to, is on the MRQE&#x27;s 50 Worst Movies list, and is one of the few films to have received an F rating on CinemaScore.

Roger Moore of &quot;The Orlando Sentinel&quot; stated: &quot;&quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; shows just how tenuous &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;″s hold on that &#x27;worst movie ever&#x27; title really is.&quot; Likewise, Peter Hartlaub, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; pop culture critic, called the film &quot;the best Ed Wood movie ever made ... a film so mind-blowingly horrible that it teeters on the edge of cinematic immortality.&quot; In 2009, he named it the worst film of the decade. Jeffrey Lyles of &quot;The Gazette&quot; considered it so bad that &quot;other legendary bad films ... await a film of this magnitude because it gets awfully lonely on the island of misfit movies&quot;, while Scott Nash of &quot;Three Movie Buffs&quot; dubbed it &quot;one of the worst movies ever made.&quot;

Screenwriter Blair Erickson wrote about his experience dealing with Boll and his original script, which was closer to the actual game itself, and Boll&#x27;s script change demands on the comedy website &quot;Something Awful&quot;. It received two 2005 Golden Raspberry Awards nominations for Worst Director (Uwe Boll) and Worst Actress (Tara Reid), and won three 2005 Stinkers Awards, for Worst Picture, Worst Director, and Worst Special Effects. &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;Flavorwire&quot; and &quot;Screen Rant&quot; all later included the film on their respective lists for the worst films ever made.

=== &quot;Aag&quot; (2007) ===

&quot;Aag&quot; is a remake of one of the most successful Hindi films, &quot;Sholay&quot;, directed by Ram Gopal Varma. Rajeev Masand gave it a zero out of five. &quot;Times of India&quot; stated that &quot;Aag&quot; &quot;destroyed Bollywood&#x27;s greatest film&quot; and acknowledged that some &quot;consider it the world&#x27;s worst film&quot;. &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; awarded it the &quot;Lifetime&#x27;s Worst Ever Movie Award&quot;. It came in first in a &quot;FHM India&quot; list of the 57 worst movies ever made. &quot;Total Film&quot; included it in their list of the 66 worst films of all time. Amitabh Bachchan, who appeared in the original film and returned for the remake, later admitted that the film was &quot;a mistake&quot;.

=== &quot;Epic Movie&quot; (2007) ===

&quot;Epic Movie&quot; is a parody film by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer that mainly parodies epic and fantasy movies, most notably &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; and the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, but also contains references to all kinds of other then-popular films. Like most works of Friedberg and Seltzer, it received extremely negative reviews, holding an approval rating of 2% on Rotten Tomatoes, and a Metacritic score of 17/100, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;.

Harry Fletcher of &quot;The Standard&quot; said: &quot;Filmmakers and trash-peddlers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have been responsible for some of the most pointless, lazy and unforgivable movies of the past decade and frankly, they need to be stopped. &quot;Disaster Movie&quot;, &quot;300&quot; spoof &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot; and awful &quot;Hunger Games&quot; mickey-take &quot;The Starving Games&quot; could easily have made this list of the worst movies ever made, but &quot;Epic Movie&quot; might be the worst of the lot.&quot; Meanwhile, Jamie Russell of the BBC called it &quot;the most excruciating, unfunny film you&#x27;ll see this year... if not your entire lifetime.&quot; Likewise, Nathan Rabin gave it an F score and said, &quot;&quot;Epic Movie&quot; [...] strays so far from the solid fundamentals of filmmaking that it calls the very foundation of humor into question.&quot;

At the 28th Golden Raspberry Awards, it received three nominations, for Worst Remake or Rip-off, Worst Screenplay and Worst Supporting Actress (Carmen Electra). It is included in Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; list of the 100 Worst Movies of All time, &quot;Empire&quot;″s and &quot;Flavorwire&quot;″s lists of the 50 worst movies ever made, &quot;Standard&quot;″s list of the 12 worst films ever made, MRQE&#x27;s 50 worst movies list and &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s list of the 50 worst comedy movies of all time.

=== &quot;I Know Who Killed Me&quot; (2007) ===

&quot;I Know Who Killed Me&quot; is a psychological thriller film directed by Chris Sivertson and starring Lindsay Lohan as identical twins, one of whom insists her identity is that of another woman after being abducted by a serial killer. At the 28th Golden Raspberry Awards, it set a record for most awards won in a single year by winning eight awards and it received two further nominations at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards.

The &quot;How Did This Get Made?&quot; podcast questioned, &quot;Is this the worst movie Lindsay Lohan has ever been in or flat out the worst movie ever?&quot; Richard Roeper selected the film as the worst of the 2000s. Gabe Delahaye of &quot;Stereogum&quot; reviewed &quot;I Know Who Killed Me&quot; as part of his search for the worst movie ever made, writing that: &quot;Out of all the possible Worst Movies of All Time so far, none has been as painful to actually watch as &quot;I Know Who Killed Me&quot;&quot;. It was named the 34th worst movie ever made in &quot;Empire&quot;″s &quot;50 Worst Movies Ever&quot; poll and &quot;After Ellen&quot; named it the second worst ever made, after &quot;Gigli&quot;. MRQE includes it on its 50 Worst Movies list, and it has a rare F rating on CinemaScore.

=== &quot;Disaster Movie&quot; (2008) ===
&quot;Disaster Movie&quot; is a parody film written and directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, spoofing films in the disaster film genre. The film, like most films by Friedberg and Seltzer, received extremely negative reviews and has a 1% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 73 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Returning to their seemingly bottomless well of flatulence humor, racial stereotypes, and stale pop culture gags, Friedberg and Seltzer have produced what is arguably their worst &quot;Movie&quot; yet.&quot; It was ranked by Rotten Tomatoes as one of the worst-reviewed films of all time. Jason Solomons of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that &quot;Nothing can convey the grimness of &quot;Disaster Movie&quot;, which would be the Worst Movie Ever Made were it actually a movie at all.&quot; Adam Tobias of &quot;Watertown Daily Times&quot; claimed that &quot;I just don&#x27;t see how anyone could not find &quot;Disaster Movie&quot; one of the worst films of all time.&quot; Tobias went on to write that the title was appropriate because the film is &quot;a disaster.&quot; It was featured in &quot;Empire&quot;″s &quot;50 Worst Movies Ever&quot; poll, &quot;Total Film&quot;″s &quot;66 Worst Movies Ever&quot; list, Metacritic&#x27;s list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and the MRQE&#x27;s 50 Worst Movies list (where it holds a score of 17, the lowest score on the site). &quot;Disaster Movie&quot; also received a rare F rating on CinemaScore. The film is also notable for being the motion picture debut of Kim Kardashian, whose performance garnered a nomination for Worst Supporting Actress at the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards alongside five additional nominations.

=== &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot; (2008) ===
Another 2008 parody movie by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot; mainly parodied the movie &quot;300&quot;, but references to numerous other films as well. Like most Friedberg and Seltzer projects, it received extremely negative reviews, holding an approval rating of 2% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus reading: &quot;A tired, unfunny, offensive waste of time, &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot; scrapes the bottom of the cinematic barrel.&quot;, and a Metacritic score of 9/100, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Josh Levin of &quot;Slate&quot; called it the worst movie he had ever seen. It is included in &quot;Empire&quot;″s and &quot;Flavorwire&quot;&#x27;s lists of the 50 worst movies ever made, &quot;News.com.au&quot;″s list of the 15 worst films of all time, Metacritic&#x27;s list of the all-time lowest-scoring films and MRQE&#x27;s 50 Worst Movies list. At the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards, it received five nominations, including Worst Picture.

=== &quot;The Hottie and the Nottie&quot; (2008) ===

The romantic comedy &quot;The Hottie and the Nottie&quot; starring Paris Hilton, Joel Moore, Christine Lakin, and The Greg Wilson opened to poor box-office takings and strongly negative reviews with a 5% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The British newspaper &quot;The People&quot;, reviewing &quot;The Hottie and the Nottie&quot;, claimed &quot;Paris Hilton is the world&#x27;s worst actress and she&#x27;s starring in the worst movie ever made.&quot; Nathan Lee of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;crass, shrill, disingenuous, tawdry, mean-spirited, vulgar, idiotic, boring, slapdash, half-assed, and very, very unfunny&quot;. Online film critic James Berardinelli described the film&#x27;s comedy as &quot;about as funny as the anal rape scene in &quot;The War Zone&quot;&quot;. Richard Roeper called it &quot;excruciatingly, painfully, horribly, terribly awful&quot;, and argued that &quot;nobody in this movie really should have a career in movies&quot;. Connie Ogle in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; described &quot;The Hottie and the Nottie&quot; thus: &quot;Imagine the worst movie you&#x27;ve ever seen. Got it? Now try to think of something worse. That something is this movie – wretched, embarrassing and a waste of the time and energy of everyone involved.&quot; The film appears on Metacritic&#x27;s list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and the MRQE&#x27;s 50 Worst Movies list.

=== &quot;Álom.net&quot; (2009) ===

&quot;Álom.net&quot; (also known as &quot;Dream Well&quot; or &quot;Dream.net&quot;) is a Hungarian film that emulates tropes found in American teen films. &quot;444.hu&quot; wrote that it is &quot;the worst movie of all time, and that&#x27;s why it became a cult film&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;24.hu&quot; and &quot;Index.hu&quot; each named it the worst Hungarian film ever made and &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported its status as &quot;the worst film of all time&quot; when it became the lowest-rated film on IMDb. &quot;Total Film&quot; named it the fourth worst film ever made and &quot;FMC.hu&quot; included it on their list of the ten worst films ever made.

== 2010s ==

=== &quot;Birdemic: Shock and Terror&quot; (2010) ===
An independently produced film that is an apparent homage to Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot;, &quot;Birdemic: Shock and Terror&quot; tells the story of a romance between the two leading characters, played by Alan Bagh and Whitney Moore, as their small town is attacked by birds. Written, directed, and produced by James Nguyen, it was intended as a &quot;romantic thriller&quot; but is notable due to its poor quality, with reviewers calling out its wooden acting, bad dialogue, amateurish sound and editing, nonsensical plot and, in particular, its special effects, consisting primarily of poorly rendered computer generated eagles and vultures that perform physically awkward aerial maneuvers and explode upon impact with the ground.

The film, which cost $10,000 to make, was called by the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; &quot;truly, one of the worst films ever made&quot; and by &quot;The Village Voice&quot; as &quot;one more in the pantheon of beloved trash-terpieces&quot;. &quot;Flavorwire&quot; ranked it number 1 in its list of the 50 worst films ever made. &quot;Slate&quot; deemed it among the worst movies ever made, while &quot;Salon&quot; referred to it as &quot;a cult hit among bad-movie fans&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; stated that the film displayed &quot;all the revered hallmarks of hilariously bad filmmaking&quot;. Following the home media release of &quot;Birdemic&quot;, Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; fame produced an audio commentary track to accompany the movie through Rifftrax. They later riffed upon the film again theatrically. In response to the cult status of the first film, a sequel—&quot;Birdemic 2: The Resurrection&quot;—was released in 2013, and included many returning members of the cast and crew. Another sequel was released on several streaming platforms on January 24, 2023 titled &quot;Birdemic: Sea Eagle&quot;.

=== &quot;The Last Airbender&quot; (2010) ===

&quot;The Last Airbender&quot; is a fantasy adventure film written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and is based on the Nickelodeon animated TV series &quot;&quot;. Upon release, the film was widely panned with critics pointing out the bad acting, numerous plot holes, screenplay, dialogue, poor special effects (despite its reported $150 million budget), and especially Shyamalan&#x27;s directing. It was also ridiculed for the poor quality of its post-converted 3-D, and the casting of white and Indian actors to portray characters who were interpreted as East Asian or Inuit in the source material triggered accusations of racism and whitewashing. The film even failed to make back its production budget domestically. &quot; Further criticism came from fans of the animated series, who said the film differed tremendously from its critically acclaimed source material. David Onda of Comcast wrote that it &quot;has been called one of the worst ever made. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;&quot;The Last Airbender&quot; is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented. The laws of chance suggest that something should have gone right. Not here. It puts a nail in the coffin of low-rent 3D, but it will need a lot more coffins than that.&quot; When asked if &quot;Last Airbender&quot; had been the worst film he has ever seen, Mike Ryan of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; answered, &quot;Yes.&quot;

It garnered nine nominations at the 31st Golden Raspberry Awards, and won five, including Worst Picture and Worst Director. &quot;Hi&quot; highlighted the film in their &quot;Worst Films Ever&quot; series, and Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; and &quot;Digital Trends&quot; included it in their worst film lists. Dev Patel would later express regret and dislike for his role and his experience with the film. He described his performance as Prince Zuko as being as though he &quot;saw a stranger on the screen that I couldn&#x27;t relate to.&quot;

=== &quot;Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star&quot; (2011) ===

&quot;Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star&quot; was produced by Adam Sandler&#x27;s Happy Madison Productions and featured Nick Swardson in the titular role as a small-town manchild who pursues a career in the pornographic film industry after learning that his parents were porn stars in the 1970s. On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Bucky Larson&quot; has a 3% rating, and it appears on the site&#x27;s list of the 100 Worst Movies of All Time. Linda Cook of the &quot;Quad-City Times&quot; described the film as &quot;the worst of the worst&quot;, while &quot;ScreenCrush&quot; critic Matt Singer picked it as the worst film ever made. Jim Vorel of &quot;Paste&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Bad Movie Diaries&quot; column suggested that &quot;Bucky Larson&quot; was the worst film covered by the column. In listing it as one of the ten worst comedies ever, Michael Musto stated that &quot;Bucky Larson&quot; was &quot;a badness the world had forgotten was capable of existing&quot;. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included it in its list of the 25 worst movies in film history and &quot;Mental Floss&quot; named it the fifth worst movie ever. &quot;Bucky Larson&quot; also appears on MRQE&#x27;s 50 Worst Movies list, and Metacritic&#x27;s list of the all-time lowest-scoring films. The film earned six nominations at the 32nd Golden Raspberry Awards, but lost in every category to &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;, which was also produced by Happy Madison Productions.

=== &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; (2011) ===
&quot;Jack and Jill&quot; is a comedy film starring Adam Sandler as Jack, a commercial director, who is visited by his &quot;identical&quot; twin sister, Jill (played by Sandler, in drag), during the holidays. &quot;Salon&quot; stated that &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; &quot;received some of the worst reviews of any movie ever&quot; upon its release. In the film, Jill is wooed by Al Pacino, whom Jack wants to be in his Dunkin&#x27; Donuts commercial. Richard Roeper of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; noted the irony of Pacino&#x27;s presence, as the actor is best known for playing Michael Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, which is widely considered one of the best films ever made, in this film, which he called &quot;one of the worst movies in the history of cinema!&quot; Ramin Setoodeh of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; and Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewed it together in an article entitled &quot;Adam Sandler&#x27;s &#x27;Jack and Jill&#x27; Is the Worst Movie Ever Made&quot;. After an hour-long critique, RedLetterMedia claimed that it was &quot;so egregious that it ceased to be a film&quot;, and the site also later called it &quot;the worst thing in the world&quot;. Mike McGranaghan wrote, on his website &quot;The Aisle Seat&quot;: &quot;&quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, &quot;Gigli&quot;, &quot;Showgirls&quot;, &quot;From Justin to Kelly&quot;. What do they all have in common? They&#x27;re all widely considered among the worst big studio movies ever made. You know what else they have in common? They&#x27;re all better than &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;.&quot; &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; won a record 10 awards at the 32nd Golden Raspberry Awards, sweeping every category. It broke the record previously held by &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; for having the most Razzies earned by a single film and is the only film to win every possible award. The film holds a 3% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, where it ranks as being one of the 100 Worst Movies of All Time. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Screen Rant&quot; have also included it on their respective worst film lists.

=== &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; (2012) ===

Another comedy film starring Adam Sandler, &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; concerns a middle school student named Donny Berger who has sex with his teacher, gets her pregnant, and in turn, earns a lifestyle of a minor celebrity, something he never intended to happen. Years later, Donny (played by Sandler) crashes his now-adult son&#x27;s (Andy Samberg) wedding and bachelor party to get money to pay his taxes, therefore avoiding prison. The film has been widely panned due to its comedic portrayal of incest, hebephilia, statutory rape, and gerontophilia, with film critic Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of &quot;Salon&quot; stating, &quot;[Sandler&#x27;s] new movie about a rape survivor and his estranged son is supposed to be funny, but radiates pain and rage.&quot; Richard Roeper of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; proclaimed, &quot;To say &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; is one of the worst movies of the year is to insult 2012. This is one of the worst movies I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;, while Richard Haridly of &quot;Quickflix&quot; called it &quot;one of the saddest and most exhausting&quot; films he has ever seen. MaryAnn Johanson of &quot;Flick Filosopher&quot; outright panned the film for its inability to generate laughs as well as its depraved content, calling it &quot;a disgusting excuse for a comedy&quot; and possibly &quot;the most repulsive movie I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;, and Jonathan Lack of &quot;We Got This Covered&quot; declared, &quot;&quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; isn&#x27;t just the worst film of 2012, it&#x27;s one of the most morally reprehensible comedies of all time, a disgusting movie you should stay far, far away from.&quot; Furthermore, Ed Whitfield of &quot;The Ooh Tray&quot; stated, &quot;It may be the worst film, in any genre, ever made&quot;. In addition to the movie&#x27;s overwhelmingly negative reviews, &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; earned eight nominations at the 33rd Golden Raspberry Awards, such as Worst Picture and Worst Director, and won the awards for Worst Actor (Sandler) and Worst Screenplay. It holds a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 115 reviews.

=== &quot;Foodfight!&quot; (2012) ===

The animated comedy &quot;Foodfight!&quot;, directed by Larry Kasanoff, features a cast of celebrity voice actors, including Charlie Sheen, Wayne Brady, Hilary Duff, and Eva Longoria. The film revolves around brand mascots, known as &quot;Ikes&quot;, who come to life in a supermarket after closing time, and their struggles against the forces of Brand X. Several actual corporate mascots make cameos in the movie, such as Mrs. Butterworth, Charlie the Tuna, and the California Raisins. Development for the movie began as early as 2000, but troubled production, including an incident where the hard drives had supposedly been stolen, and financial difficulties delayed its release several times. The film eventually received a limited theatrical release in Europe in 2012, and it became a box-office bomb, earning just $74,000 against its reported $65 million budget. &quot;Foodfight!&quot; was also critically panned for its animation, humor, use of product placement as a central theme (and being aimed towards children), and content inappropriate for its target audience, such as sexual innuendo and references to Nazism.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; article condemned the film, saying: &quot;The animation appears unfinished ... And the plot ... is impenetrable and even offensive.&quot; The article also reported that &quot;Foodfight!&quot; had been &quot;seized upon by Internet purveyors of bad cinema&quot;. One such Internet critic was Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, who included the film in his &quot;My World of Flops&quot; column, describing it as &quot;one of those fall-of-civilization moments&quot; and &quot;This is the kind of movie so unbelievably, surreally and exquisitely terrible that you want to share it with the rest of the world. I was put on earth to suffer through abominations like &quot;Foodfight!&quot; so that society as a whole might benefit from my Christ-like sacrifice.&quot; Meanwhile, a review in &quot;Esquire&quot; described it as &quot;&quot;The Room&quot;, rendered in horribly sharp polygons&quot; and &quot;Hollywood News&quot; called it &quot;by far the crappiest piece of crap I have ever had the misfortune to watch&quot;. Likewise, critic Tim Brayton described it as &quot;the absolute ugliest animated feature that has ever been released by something resembling an actual animation studio ... one of the very worst movies I have ever seen.&quot; In 2024, &quot;Collider&quot; described it as the &quot;absolute worst [movie] of the 21st century, without any real competition.&quot; &quot;Digital Trends&quot;, &quot;Time Out&quot;, &quot;Fotogramas&quot;, &quot;Mental Floss&quot; and MSN have since included &quot;Foodfight!&quot; in their worst film lists. Rebecca Hawkes of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described &quot;Foodfight!&quot; as &quot;the worst animated children&#x27;s film ever made&quot;, while &quot;IndieWire&quot;, &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; and &quot;Screen Rant&quot; have each described it as being one of the worst animated films ever made.

=== &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; (2012) ===

A British comedy film based on the stage farce of the same name, &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; starred Danny Dyer as John Smith, a bigamist, and Denise van Outen and Sarah Harding as his wives. &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; was directed by the author of the play, Ray Cooney (who also makes an uncredited cameo appearance). Upon release, &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; was savaged by film critics, with the South African newspaper &quot;Daily News&quot; saying &quot;&quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; could be the worst film in history&quot;, the Studio Briefing website reporting that &quot;Some writers are making the case that the British comedy may be &#x27;the worst film ever, and &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; claiming &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; &quot;was branded the worst British film ever&quot;. &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; met with such overwhelmingly negative reviews upon release that the reviews themselves were widely reported in the UK media. The film was variously described as &quot;a catastrophe&quot;, &quot;as funny as leprosy&quot; and &quot;30 years past its sell-by-date&quot;, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewer Peter Bradshaw saying that it &quot;makes &quot;The Dick Emery Show&quot; look edgy and contemporary&quot;. &quot;The Independent&#x27;s&quot; Anthony Quinn wrote, &quot;The stage play ran for nine years – it [the film] will be lucky to run for nine days. Perhaps never in the field of light entertainment have so many actors sacrificed so much dignity in the cause of so few jokes ... From the look of it, Cooney hasn&#x27;t been in a cinema for about 30 years&quot;.

The cast featured numerous British celebrities in cameo roles, which was commented upon by several reviewers. The &quot;Metro&quot; commented that &quot;no one emerges unscathed among the cameo-packed cast that reads largely like a roll-call for Brit TV legends you&#x27;d previously suspected deceased&quot;. The &quot;Daily Record&quot; described the film as &quot;an exasperating farce containing not one single, solitary laugh. people losing their trousers and falling over, the film looks like a pilot for a (mercifully) never-commissioned 70s sitcom&quot;. An article in the &quot;Independent&quot; described &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; (along with the similarly panned &quot;Movie 43&quot;) as contenders for the title of the &quot;worst film in history&quot;. &quot;The Berkhamsted &amp; Tring Gazette&quot; reported &quot;critics have been queuing up to batter recent release &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot;, with general agreement that it ranks among the worst British comedies of all time&quot;. &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; was also a box office bomb, earning only £602 in its opening weekend at the British box office to its £900,000 budget. &quot;Run for Your Wife&quot; has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews.

=== &quot;Fateful Findings&quot; (2012) ===
&quot;Fateful Findings&quot; is a 2012 independent techno-thriller written, directed and produced by Neil Breen. Breen also starred in the film and took on most of the crew roles, including film editor, sound editor, accountant, caterer, set designer, wardrobe, makeup and casting. The film follows an author-turned-hacker with supernatural powers who uses his abilities to reveal vague &quot;government and corporate secrets&quot;, while beset by numerous relationship dramas, and ends with an extended sequence at a press conference where politicians and businesspeople confess to corruption and kill themselves before an applauding crowd.

Writing for &quot;Film Threat&quot;, reviewer Mike Hodges described it as &quot;the worst movie ever made&quot;, comparing it unfavorably to &quot;Troll 2&quot; and &quot;The Room&quot;. Nathan Rabin, writing for Rotten Tomatoes, said &quot;Fateful Findings&quot; threatens &quot;The Room&quot;″s position as &quot;best worst movie&quot;, while reviewers of the podcast &quot;The Flop House&quot; said &quot;Move over &quot;The Room&quot;, move over &quot;Birdemic&quot;&quot; and &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; head writer Elliott Kalan described it as the &quot;good-est bad movie, maybe, I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; said &quot;Fateful Findings&quot; sits &quot;right next to [&quot;The Room&quot;] on the Mt. Rushmore of bad movies&quot;, and noted that while Tommy Wiseau had eventually embraced and encouraged mockery of &quot;The Room&quot;, Breen doesn&#x27;t &quot;pretend to be &#x27;in on it&#x27;&quot; and the film maintains a &quot;magic&quot; as sincere outsider art. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; later listed it as one of the worst films of all time.

=== &quot;Movie 43&quot; (2013) ===

Produced and co-directed by Peter Farrelly, among others, &quot;Movie 43&quot; is a gross-out sex comedy film consisting of several vignettes each by a different director and a sizable cast of recognizable actors and actresses including Dennis Quaid, Greg Kinnear, Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Liev Schreiber, Naomi Watts, Anna Faris, Emma Stone, Richard Gere, Uma Thurman, Chloë Grace Moretz, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Stephen Merchant, Kristen Bell, Terrence Howard, Elizabeth Banks, Kate Bosworth, Johnny Knoxville, Justin Long, Chris Pratt, Josh Duhamel, and Jason Sudeikis. Holding a score of 5% on Rotten Tomatoes, it is included on the site&#x27;s 100 Worst Movies of All Time list, and is also on the MRQE&#x27;s 50 Worst Movies list. &quot;Movie 43&quot; won three awards at the 34th Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. In the Worst Director category, all 13 directors won the award.

Several critics have called it one of the worst films ever made, including Peter Howell of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, who said, &quot;There&#x27;s just one use for &quot;Movie 43&quot;, apart from it being ground into the landfill that it deserves to become sooner rather than later. It provides me with a handy new answer to a question I&#x27;m often asked: &#x27;What&#x27;s the worst film you&#x27;ve ever seen? Brady Murphy of &quot;Murphy Reviews&quot; wrote that the movie &quot;had no heart&quot; and gave it the site&#x27;s first zero out of ten rating. Meanwhile, Richard Roeper of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; voiced similar hatred, calling it &quot;aggressively tasteless&quot; and &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of awful.&quot; Lou Lumenick stated, &quot;If you mashed-up the worst parts of the infamous &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, &quot;Gigli&quot;, &quot;Ishtar&quot; and every other awful movie I&#x27;ve seen since I started reviewing professionally in 1981, it wouldn&#x27;t begin to approach the sheer soul-sucking badness of the cringe-inducing &quot;Movie 43&quot;.&quot; Elizabeth Weitzman of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; also considered it the worst movie she ever saw.

=== &quot;Humshakals&quot; (2014) ===
A Bollywood comedy film directed by Sajid Khan, &quot;Humshakals&quot; featured Indian actors Saif Ali Khan, Ram Kapoor and Riteish Deshmukh. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 0% rating, based on six reviews, with an average rating of 2/10. Mihir Fadnavis wrote in his &quot;Firstpost&quot; review, &quot;sexual tomfoolery, shrieking and hamming aside, there&#x27;s much more to hate about this &#x27;family movie&#x27;. It&#x27;s disturbing to see such an atrocious, regressive, misogynistic, sexist, homophobic cinematic product force-fed to paying audiences. I can understand that a comedy need not be &#x27;safe&#x27;, but what goes on in &quot;Humshakals&quot; is simply too horrifying to bear.&quot; Saurabh Dwivedi of &quot;India Today&quot; stated &quot;I can only say that &quot;Humshakals&quot; will be listed in one of the worst films of the century.&quot; Writing in &quot;Emirates 24/7&quot;, Sneha May Francis said that it succeeded Khan&#x27;s previous endeavor, &quot;Himmatwala&quot;, in becoming the worst Bollywood film ever. Fadnavis went further, writing that it displaced &quot;Himmatwala&quot; as the &quot;worst possible product any film industry in the world can offer&quot;. Itrath Syed of &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot; stated that &quot;Humshakals&quot; was &quot;the absolute bottom of the cinematic barrel&quot;. The film received five Golden Kela Award nominations, and won the &quot;award&quot; for Worst Film. It also won two Ghanta Awards; the film won Worst Picture and Ram Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan and Riteish Deshmukh shared the Worst Actor award.

Several of the cast members also lamented their involvement in the film. Despite being the film&#x27;s leading actress, Bipasha Basu did not participate in the film&#x27;s promotions because she was &quot;extremely disturbed by the end result&quot; and stated that &quot;&quot;Humshakals&quot; was the worst experience of my life&quot;. Another cast member, actress Esha Gupta, warned her family to not watch the film. After the release of the film, leading actor Saif Ali Khan lamented that &quot;I&#x27;ve been introspecting a lot and will never repeat a mistake that was &quot;Humshakals&quot;.&quot;

=== &quot;Saving Christmas&quot; (2014) ===

&quot;Saving Christmas&quot; is a faith-based Christmas comedy film starring Kirk Cameron, who plays a fictionalized version of himself attempting to convince his brother-in-law (played by the film&#x27;s director, Darren Doane) that Christmas is still a Christian holiday. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 0% rating, based on 19 reviews, with an average rating of 2.40/10. Critic David Keyes described &quot;Saving Christmas&quot; as &quot;The worst holiday movie ever made&quot;, &quot;Billings Gazette&quot; selected the film as the worst Christmas movie of all time, and Will Nicol of &quot;Digital Trends&quot; included it on his list of the ten worst movies ever made. Christy Lemire picked &quot;Saving Christmas&quot; as the worst film she has ever reviewed and called it &quot;&quot;The Room&quot; of Christmas movies&quot; (while adding that she found &quot;The Room&quot; to be more enjoyable) and gave it a score of zero stars out of four. Reece Taylor of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; also considers it the worst film ever made. The film&#x27;s history after release was further marred by widespread vote brigading; Cameron asked fans to give the film positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, which resulted in a backlash of Internet users instead travelling to the Rotten Tomatoes page to review bomb the film. Three weeks after its release, &quot;Saving Christmas&quot; became the lowest-rated film on IMDb&#x27;s bottom 100 list. Cameron blamed the low rating on a Reddit campaign by &quot;haters and atheists&quot; to purposely lower the film&#x27;s ratings. The film won four awards, including Worst Picture, at the 35th Golden Raspberry Awards.

=== &quot;United Passions&quot; (2014) ===

A 2014 English-language French drama film about the origins of the football world governing body Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), &quot;United Passions&quot; starred Tim Roth (as FIFA President Sepp Blatter), Gérard Depardieu and Sam Neill and was directed by Frédéric Auburtin. &quot;United Passions&quot;″ release in the U.S. occurred simultaneously with the 2015 FIFA corruption case, in which several current and former members of FIFA&#x27;s executive committee were arrested on charges of corruption, and Blatter himself resigned following repeated accusations of corruption at FIFA under his leadership. &quot;United Passions&quot; was accused of ignoring these long-running claims. &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;″s Des Kelly wrote that &quot;United Passions&quot; was &quot;the worst movie ever made&quot; and &quot;the most extraordinary vanity exercise; a vile, self-aggrandizing, sugar-coated pile of manure&quot;. Sean Mahoney of &quot;Inquisitr&quot; called it the &quot;worst movie ever&quot;. Daniel Gold of &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed &quot;United Passions&quot; is &quot;one of the most unwatchable films in recent memory, a dishonest bit of corporate-suite sanitizing that&#x27;s no good even for laughs&quot;, later stating it would make the top three of his list of all time bad films. Several critics noted the irony of the film&#x27;s depiction of Blatter as an anti-corruption campaigner. Paul Field of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; said that this created &quot;unintentional comedy gold&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;United Passions&quot; has an approval rating of 0% based on 16 reviews, while on Metacritic, the film holds a score of 1 out of 100, based on 9 critics, and is tied for the lowest scoring film on the site. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; subsequently included it on its list of the 25 worst movies of all time.

&quot;United Passions&quot; was also a box-office bomb, becoming the second-lowest-grossing film ever in American history, with a total take of $918, surpassed only by the 2006 thriller &quot;Zyzzyx Road&quot;. The film additionally went directly to DVD in France and was not distributed in a number of other European countries. Several of the people involved in &quot;United Passions&quot; later expressed regret over the film. Director Auburtin called &quot;United Passions&quot; &quot;a disaster&quot; and added: &quot;Now I&#x27;m seen as bad as the guy who brought AIDS to Africa or the guy who caused the financial crisis ... apparently I am a propaganda guy making films for corrupt people.&quot; Roth apologized for taking part in the film and admitted that he took the job in &quot;United Passions&quot; for the money. It also received the first Barry L. Bumstead Award during the 36th Golden Raspberry Awards, a special category for critical and financial failures that were not given an eligible release.

===&quot;Dirty Grandpa&quot; (2016)===

&quot;Dirty Grandpa&quot;, a 2016 comedy film starring Robert De Niro and Zac Efron as a grandfather and grandson going to Florida during spring break, received negative reviews for its gross-out and shock humor that was also considered as sexist, homophobic, and racist. Mike Ryan of &quot;Uproxx&quot; said: &quot;&quot;Dirty Grandpa&quot; is the worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen in a movie theater. Burn it.&quot; He later also picked it as the worst film he had ever both reviewed and seen. Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood said: &quot;... &quot;Dirty Grandpa,&quot; is not just the worst movie [De Niro] has ever been in, but it may be the worst movie &quot;anyone&quot; has ever been in.&quot; Glenn McDonald of Indy Week said: &quot;The awful, ugly &quot;Dirty Grandpa&quot; is the comedy equivalent of torture porn ... In fact, in the dizzying moments after being bludgeoned by this miserable specimen, I was convinced it&#x27;s among the worst movies ever made.&quot; Richard Roeper gave the film zero stars, writing, &quot;If &quot;Dirty Grandpa&quot; isn&#x27;t the worst movie of 2016, I have some serious cinematic torture in my near future.&quot; On his YouTube channel, Roeper also said: &quot;I&#x27;m not ready to say &quot;Dirty Grandpa&quot; is the worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen, but I&#x27;m also not ready to say it&#x27;s &quot;not&quot; the worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Mark Kermode, on his BBC Radio 5 Live show (&quot;Kermode and Mayo&#x27;s Film Review&quot;), said that he found the film &quot;truly, genuinely horrible&quot; and went on to say, &quot;after &quot;Dirty Grandpa&quot; I did feel genuinely unclean, I wanted to go and have a shower, because it&#x27;s just so revolting. Somewhere in hell there is a multiplex playing this on a double bill, with &quot;Movie 43&quot; and &quot;Entourage&quot;.&quot; He would later go on to brand it his least favorite film of 2016.

Glenn Kenny of &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; said: &quot;The actor Bela Lugosi appeared in some landmark, perhaps even great, films at the beginning of his Hollywood career in the 1930s. ... Lugosi&#x27;s final film was 1957&#x27;s &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, frequently cited as the worst film ever made. The cinematic landmarks of De Niro&#x27;s career include films such as Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; and Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. He has been featured in a good number of very bad films in the years since. But this? This might just be his own &quot;Plan 9.&quot;&quot; The film has an approval rating of 10% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 135 reviews, with an average rating of 3.1/10, while on Metacritic it has a score of 21 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. At the 37th Golden Raspberry Awards it received five nominations, for Worst Picture, Worst Actor (De Niro), Worst Screenplay, and two nominations for Worst Supporting Actress (Julianne Hough and Aubrey Plaza), but did not win in any category.

=== &quot;Guardians&quot; (2017) ===

&quot;Guardians&quot; is a 2017 Russian superhero film about a team of Soviet superheroes created during the Cold War. It was criticized for having a derivative plot, bad acting and direction, cheap CGI, plot holes, and overall low quality. &quot;Kg-portal.ru&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Guardians&quot; is a film from which Russian cinema should be protected. It&#x27;s like a sequel to &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, filmed by Uwe Boll, with the screenplay by Tommy Wiseau and with him in the lead role.&quot; &quot;Rossiyskaya Gazeta&quot; commented that the film was &quot;Worse than you can imagine.&quot; &quot;Meduza&quot; compared the film&#x27;s director, Sarik Andreasyan, to &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;″s director, Ed Wood, and said that &quot;Guardians&quot; &quot;is a convincing answer to the eternal question of why we can never catch up with Hollywood even in our own box office&quot;. &quot;Afisha&quot; said that it was the Russian answer to &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, and Ivi, Inc. commented that &quot;a more talentless film is hard to imagine&quot;. RIA Novosti placed it at the top of their worst film list and Russian review aggregator Kritikanstvo listed it among the all-time lowest-scoring films. Critics outside of Russia generally panned the film but were not as harsh, as it has a 33% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 reviews. A sequel was planned, but the film was a box-office bomb, which resulted in the film&#x27;s production company, Enjoy Movies, subsequently filing for bankruptcy, and the Cinema Foundation of Russia, which provided part of the budget, suing the company and demanding a return of the investment.

===&quot;Loqueesha&quot; (2019)===

The 2019 comedy film &quot;Loqueesha&quot; stars Jeremy Saville, who also independently wrote, directed, and produced the film, as Joe, who needs money to pay for his son&#x27;s private school education and, after getting rejected for a job as a radio host, the listing for which encourages women and minorities to apply, gets the job by pretending to be a sassy black woman named Loqueesha who gives out advice on air. The film&#x27;s trailer and poster were panned online as racist and stereotypical upon their release, with &quot;Entertainment.ie&quot;″s Brian Lloyd writing that it was &quot;one the [&quot;sic&quot;] worst fucking things we have ever seen, and we still can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s actually real&quot;. Upon seeing the actual film, Nathan Rabin said that the film was &quot;somehow much worse&quot; than the trailer led people to believe.

The film was universally panned by critics, as it garnered a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Joel Golby of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the plot &quot;one of the more offensive in history&quot;, also criticizing its lighting, sound design, and acting, among other aspects of the film, and writing, &quot;The worst film ever made. Worse than &quot;The Room&quot;, in every way. The one-star rating it currently has on IMDb is actively generous. I cannot believe this film got made.&quot; Dan Kahan of &quot;Popdust&quot; called it &quot;genuinely the worst movie [he had] ever watched&quot;, calling Saville an &quot;unbelievable racist&quot; and deeming the movie &quot;grotesque&quot;, &quot;abhorrent&quot;, and &quot;criminal&quot;. For &quot;Decider&quot;, Kay-B wrote that she &quot;wouldn&#x27;t recommend this film to anyone, living or dead&quot; as it was &quot;painfully hard to watch&quot; while also dubbing it &quot;the year&#x27;s most reviled movie&quot;.

===&quot;Cats&quot; (2019)===
&quot;Cats&quot; is a film adaptation of the popular musical penned by Andrew Lloyd Webber (based on the works of T. S. Eliot) and directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Tom Hooper (&quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;). The film is about a tribe of cats called the Jellicles as they hold their Jellicle Ball, an annual ceremony where the cats compete for the chance to enter the Heaviside Layer, where the chosen Jellicle will be granted a new life.

Lloyd Webber condemned the film as &quot;ridiculous&quot; stating, &quot;The problem with the film was that Tom Hooper decided that he didn&#x27;t want anybody involved in it who was involved in the original show.&quot;
It was criticized for CGI &quot;digital fur technology&quot;, which depicted the film&#x27;s actors as bipedal cats. An updated version of the film, with a refined CGI patch, was sent to theaters after its premiere. Describing the experimentation with digital fur as one of the worst decisions in movie history, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;There are many, many other problems with &quot;Cats&quot;, ... but it was hard for anyone to focus on any of them when it just looked so shitty and disturbing.&quot; Other critics also panned the performances of some of the actors, with James Corden and Rebel Wilson (who parodied themselves at the 92nd Academy Awards) receiving the most criticism. , &quot;Cats&quot; sits at a 19% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film won six awards out of nine nominations at the 40th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Director for Hooper, Worst Supporting Actress for Wilson, Worst Supporting Actor for Corden, and Worst Picture overall.

Early reviews for &quot;Cats&quot; were embargoed. Manohla Dargis from &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that &quot;[a] doctoral thesis could be written about how this misfire sputtered into existence&quot;. British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called the film an &quot;all-time disaster&quot; with reviewer Tim Robey giving the film &quot;zero stars&quot; in his review. Critics from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;The Detroit News&quot; wrote that it was a candidate for the worst film of the 2010s, with &quot;The Detroit News&quot; reviewer Adam Graham writing: &quot;&quot;Cats&quot; is the biggest disaster of the decade, and possibly thus far in the millennium. It&#x27;s &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; with whiskers.&quot; Graham later selected &quot;Cats&quot; as the worst movie he had ever seen. Wade Major of &quot;CineGods.com&quot; slammed it as &quot;&quot;Showgirls&quot; with fur&quot;, while &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; screenwriter J. David Shapiro (who previously won the Razzie for Worst Screenplay) said &quot;Cats&quot; had usurped his film as the worst ever made. &quot;Cats&quot; was included on &quot;Time Out&quot;″s 40 Best Bad Movies Ever Made list.

=== &quot;365 Days&quot; (2020) ===
&quot;365 Days&quot; (Polish: &quot;365 Dni&quot;) is a 2020 Polish erotic romantic drama film directed by Barbara Białowąs and Tomasz Mandes. It is based on the first novel of a trilogy by Blanka Lipińska. The plot follows a young woman from Warsaw in a spiritless relationship falling for a dominant Sicilian man, who imprisons and imposes on her a period of 365 days for which to fall in love with him. It stars Michele Morrone as Don Massimo Torricelli and Anna-Maria Sieklucka as Laura Biel. The film was released theatrically in Poland on February 7, 2020, and was later made available on Netflix on June 7, 2020, where, despite extremely negative critical response, it became one of the most-watched films, for a time being the fourth-most-watched media on Netflix UK and the third-most-watched media on Netflix US, and gained global attention. It was also a box-office success at Polish cinemas, grossing an estimated $8,964,000. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, who heavily criticized its softcore themes, sexual violence and Mafia glorification. Rotten Tomatoes collected 16 reviews and identified 0% of them as positive, with an average rating of 1.9/10. Polish English-language news website &quot;The First News&quot; says that it has been dubbed one of the worst films ever. Taylor Andrews of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; called it the worst thing he had ever seen. Kevin Maher of &quot;The Times&quot; said &quot;There haven&#x27;t been line readings this poor since the third act of &quot;The Room&quot;&quot; and &quot;It makes the bonking puppets in &quot;Team America: World Police&quot; look like straight-faced documentary&quot;. Maddy Mussen of &quot;The Tab&quot; called it &quot;the worst thing Netflix has ever produced&quot; and said &quot;If you have watched &quot;365 Days&quot; on Netflix, there will not be a doubt in your mind that it&#x27;s the worst thing you&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Jessica Kiang of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a thoroughly terrible, politically objectionable, occasionally hilarious Polish humpathon&quot;.

In March 2021, the film was nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards, for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Actor (Michele Morrone), Worst Actress (Anna-Maria Sieklucka), Worst Screenplay and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, becoming the second foreign-language film to be nominated for Worst Picture after Italy&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (2002; albeit the dubbed version), and won only one in the Screenplay category.

=== &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey&quot; (2023) ===
&quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey&quot; is a 2023 low-budget British horror film which reimagines the characters of the series of children&#x27;s books by A.A. Milne as mutant slasher villains, released after Milne&#x27;s work entered the public domain a year prior. It was widely criticized for its premise, alongside lack of humor, poor acting, low grade special effects, incoherent screenplay, poorly lit scenes and dearth of interesting characters. Nathan Rabin stated that the film was &quot;the regrettable product of a loophole in copyright law that allowed these vultures to twist and distort and corrupt A.A. Milne&#x27;s beloved icons of gentleness and childhood innocence to their own mercenary ends.&quot; Rabin issued his first zero star review for the film, in which he referenced Roger Ebert&#x27;s 1994 review of &quot;North&quot; by stating: &quot;I Hated, Hated, Hated &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey&quot;.&quot; With a score of 3%, it appears on Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; 100 Worst Movies of All Time list. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; later placed it at the top of their 10 Terrible Movies You Don&#x27;t Have to See to Know They&#x27;re Bad list.

Shawn Paul Wood of &quot;The Cinema Spot&quot; wrote, &quot;As anyone can tell, &quot;Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey&quot; is one of the worst movies ever made. And, by the looks of its dazzling lack of antipathy for protecting its copyright, Disney knew it.&quot; Matt Villei of &quot;Collider&quot; wrote, &quot;If these reviews are anything to go by, the film might find itself in a spot of bother as it is being called one of the worst horror movies ever, though some predicted that, from its low quality, the film could garner a cult following similar to Tommy Wiseau&#x27;s disasterpiece, &quot;The Room&quot;.&quot; It received all five Razzies that it was nominated for at the 44th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Screenplay and Director (Rhys Frake-Waterfield).

Jim Cummings, the current voice actor for Disney&#x27;s Pooh and Tigger, has also openly bashed the movie in an interview, calling it &quot;absolutely disgusting&quot;, as well as threatening the film makers with legal action if they dared to use or imitate his voice for their version of the title character.

<text>Color vision, a feature of visual perception, is an ability to perceive differences between light composed of different frequencies independently of light intensity.

Color perception is a part of the larger visual system and is mediated by a complex process between neurons that begins with differential stimulation of different types of photoreceptors by light entering the eye. Those photoreceptors then emit outputs that are propagated through many layers of neurons ultimately leading to higher cognitive functions in the brain. Color vision is found in many animals and is mediated by similar underlying mechanisms with common types of biological molecules and a complex history of evolution in different animal taxa. In primates, color vision may have evolved under selective pressure for a variety of visual tasks including the foraging for nutritious young leaves, ripe fruit, and flowers, as well as detecting predator camouflage and emotional states in other primates.

==Wavelength==

Isaac Newton discovered that white light after being split into its component colors when passed through a dispersive prism could be recombined to make white light by passing them through a different prism. The visible light spectrum ranges from about 380 to 740 nanometers. Spectral colors (colors that are produced by a narrow band of wavelengths) such as red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and violet can be found in this range. These spectral colors do not refer to a single wavelength, but rather to a set of wavelengths: red, 625–740 nm; orange, 590–625 nm; yellow, 565–590 nm; green, 500–565 nm; cyan, 485–500 nm; blue, 450–485 nm; violet, 380–450 nm.

Wavelengths longer or shorter than this range are called infrared or ultraviolet, respectively. Humans cannot generally see these wavelengths, but other animals may.

=== Hue detection ===
Sufficient differences in wavelength cause a difference in the perceived hue; the just-noticeable difference in wavelength varies from about 1 nm in the blue-green and yellow wavelengths to 10 nm and more in the longer red and shorter blue wavelengths. Although the human eye can distinguish up to a few hundred hues, when those pure spectral colors are mixed together or diluted with white light, the number of distinguishable chromaticities can be much higher.

In very low light levels, vision is scotopic: light is detected by rod cells of the retina. Rods are maximally sensitive to wavelengths near 500 nm and play little, if any, role in color vision. In brighter light, such as daylight, vision is photopic: light is detected by cone cells which are responsible for color vision. Cones are sensitive to a range of wavelengths, but are most sensitive to wavelengths near 555 nm. Between these regions, mesopic vision comes into play and both rods and cones provide signals to the retinal ganglion cells. The shift in color perception from dim light to daylight gives rise to differences known as the Purkinje effect.

The perception of &quot;white&quot; is formed by the entire spectrum of visible light, or by mixing colors of just a few wavelengths in animals with few types of color receptors. In humans, white light can be perceived by combining wavelengths such as red, green, and blue, or just a pair of complementary colors such as blue and yellow.

=== Non-spectral colors ===
There are a variety of colors in addition to spectral colors and their hues. These include grayscale colors, shades of colors obtained by mixing grayscale colors with spectral colors, violet-red colors, impossible colors, and metallic colors.

Grayscale colors include white, gray, and black. Rods contain rhodopsin, which reacts to light intensity, providing grayscale coloring.

Shades include colors such as pink or brown. Pink is obtained from mixing red and white. Brown may be obtained from mixing orange with gray or black. Navy is obtained from mixing blue and black.

Violet-red colors include hues and shades of magenta. The light spectrum is a line on which violet is one end and the other is red, and yet we see hues of purple that connect those two colors.

Impossible colors are a combination of cone responses that cannot be naturally produced. For example, medium cones cannot be activated completely on their own; if they were, we would see a &#x27;hyper-green&#x27; color.

==Dimensionality==
Color vision is categorized foremost according to the dimensionality of the color gamut, which is defined by the number of primaries required to represent the color vision. This is generally equal to the number of photopsins expressed: a correlation that holds for vertebrates but not invertebrates. The common vertebrate ancestor possessed four photopsins (expressed in cones) plus rhodopsin (expressed in rods), so was tetrachromatic. However, many vertebrate lineages have lost one or many photopsin genes, leading to lower-dimension color vision. The dimensions of color vision range from 1-dimensional and up:
==Physiology of color perception==
Perception of color begins with specialized retinal cells known as cone cells. Cone cells contain different forms of opsin – a pigment protein – that have different spectral sensitivities. Humans contain three types, resulting in trichromatic color vision.

Each individual cone contains pigments composed of opsin apoprotein covalently linked to a light-absorbing prosthetic group: either 11-&quot;cis&quot;-hydroretinal or, more rarely, 11-&quot;cis&quot;-dehydroretinal.

The cones are conventionally labeled according to the ordering of the wavelengths of the peaks of their spectral sensitivities: short (S), medium (M), and long (L) cone types. These three types do not correspond well to particular colors as we know them. Rather, the perception of color is achieved by a complex process that starts with the differential output of these cells in the retina and which is finalized in the visual cortex and associative areas of the brain.

For example, while the L cones have been referred to simply as red receptors, microspectrophotometry has shown that their peak sensitivity is in the greenish-yellow region of the spectrum. Similarly, the S cones and M cones do not directly correspond to blue and green, although they are often described as such. The RGB color model, therefore, is a convenient means for representing color but is not directly based on the types of cones in the human eye.

The peak response of human cone cells varies, even among individuals with so-called normal color vision;
in some non-human species this polymorphic variation is even greater, and it may well be adaptive.

===Theories===

Two complementary theories of color vision are the trichromatic theory and the opponent process theory. The trichromatic theory, or Young–Helmholtz theory, proposed in the 19th century by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz, posits three types of cones preferentially sensitive to blue, green, and red, respectively. Others have suggested that the trichromatic theory is not specifically a theory of color vision but a theory of receptors for all vision, including color but not specific or limited to it. Equally, it has been suggested that the relationship between the phenomenal opponency described by Ewald Hering and the physiological opponent processes are not straightforward (see below), making of physiological opponency a mechanism that is relevant to the whole of vision, and not just to color vision alone. Hering proposed the opponent process theory in 1872. It states that the visual system interprets color in an antagonistic way: red vs. green, blue vs. yellow, black vs. white. Both theories are generally accepted as valid, describing different stages in visual physiology, visualized in the adjacent diagram.

Green–magenta and blue–yellow are scales with mutually exclusive boundaries. In the same way that there cannot exist a &quot;slightly negative&quot; positive number, a single eye cannot perceive a bluish-yellow or a reddish-green. Although these two theories are both currently widely accepted theories, past and more recent work has led to criticism of the opponent process theory, stemming from a number of what are presented as discrepancies in the standard opponent process theory. For example, the phenomenon of an after-image of complementary color can be induced by fatiguing the cells responsible for color perception, by staring at a vibrant color for a length of time, and then looking at a white surface. This phenomenon of complementary colors demonstrates cyan, rather than green, to be the complement of red and magenta, rather than red, to be the complement of green, as well as demonstrating, as a consequence, that the reddish-green color proposed to be impossible by opponent process theory is, in fact, the color yellow. Although this phenomenon is more readily explained by the trichromatic theory, explanations for the discrepancy may include alterations to the opponent process theory, such as redefining the opponent colors as red vs. cyan, to reflect this effect. Despite such criticisms, both theories remain in use.

A newer theory proposed by Edwin H. Land, the Retinex Theory, is based on a demonstration of color constancy, which shows that the color of any surface that is part of a complex &quot;natural scene&quot; is to a large degree independent of the wavelength composition of the light reflected from it. Also the after-image produced by looking at a given part of a complex scene is also independent of the wavelength composition of the light reflected from it alone. Thus, while the color of the after-image produced by looking at a green surface that is reflecting more &quot;green&quot; (middle-wave) than &quot;red&quot; (long-wave) light is magenta, so is the after–image of the same surface when it reflects more &quot;red&quot; than &quot;green&quot; light (when it is still perceived as green). This would seem to rule out an explanation of color opponency based on retinal cone adaptation.

According to Land&#x27;s Retinex theory, color in a &quot;natural scene&quot; depends upon the three sets of cone cells (&quot;red,&quot; &quot;green,&quot; and &quot;blue&quot;) separately perceiving each surface&#x27;s relative lightness in the scene and, together with the visual cortex, assigning color based on comparing the lightness values perceived by each set of cone cells.

===Cone cells in the human eye===

A range of wavelengths of light stimulates each of these receptor types to varying degrees. The brain combines the information from each type of receptor to give rise to different perceptions of different wavelengths of light.
Cones and rods are not evenly distributed in the human eye. Cones have a high density at the fovea and a low density in the rest of the retina. Thus color information is mostly taken in at the fovea. Humans have poor color perception in their peripheral vision, and much of the color we see in our periphery may be filled in by what our brains expect to be there on the basis of context and memories. However, our accuracy of color perception in the periphery increases with the size of stimulus.

The opsins (photopigments) present in the L and M cones are encoded on the X chromosome; defective encoding of these leads to the two most common forms of color blindness. The &quot;OPN1LW&quot; gene, which encodes the opsin present in the L cones, is highly polymorphic; one study found 85 variants in a sample of 236 men. A small percentage of women may have an extra type of color receptor because they have different alleles for the gene for the L opsin on each X chromosome. X chromosome inactivation means that while only one opsin is expressed in each cone cell, both types may occur overall, and some women may therefore show a degree of tetrachromatic color vision. Variations in &quot;OPN1MW&quot;, which encodes the opsin expressed in M cones, appear to be rare, and the observed variants have no effect on spectral sensitivity.

===Color in the primate brain===
Color processing begins at a very early level in the visual system (even within the retina) through initial color opponent mechanisms. Both Helmholtz&#x27;s trichromatic theory and Hering&#x27;s opponent-process theory are therefore correct, but trichromacy arises at the level of the receptors, and opponent processes arise at the level of retinal ganglion cells and beyond. In Hering&#x27;s theory, opponent mechanisms refer to the opposing color effect of red–green, blue–yellow, and light-dark. However, in the visual system, it is the activity of the different receptor types that are opposed. Some midget retinal ganglion cells oppose L and M cone activity, which corresponds loosely to red–green opponency, but actually runs along an axis from blue-green to magenta. Small bistratified retinal ganglion cells oppose input from the S cones to input from the L and M cones. This is often thought to correspond to blue–yellow opponency but actually runs along a color axis from yellow-green to violet.

Visual information is then sent to the brain from retinal ganglion cells via the optic nerve to the optic chiasma: a point where the two optic nerves meet and information from the temporal (contralateral) visual field crosses to the other side of the brain. After the optic chiasma, the visual tracts are referred to as the optic tracts, which enter the thalamus to synapse at the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).

The lateral geniculate nucleus is divided into laminae (zones), of which there are three types: the M-laminae, consisting primarily of M-cells, the P-laminae, consisting primarily of P-cells, and the koniocellular laminae. M- and P-cells receive relatively balanced input from both L- and M-cones throughout most of the retina, although this seems to not be the case at the fovea, with midget cells synapsing in the P-laminae. The koniocellular laminae receives axons from the small bistratified ganglion cells.

After synapsing at the LGN, the visual tract continues on back to the primary visual cortex (V1) located at the back of the brain within the occipital lobe. Within V1 there is a distinct band (striation). This is also referred to as &quot;striate cortex&quot;, with other cortical visual regions referred to collectively as &quot;extrastriate cortex&quot;. It is at this stage that color processing becomes much more complicated.

In V1 the simple three-color segregation begins to break down. Many cells in V1 respond to some parts of the spectrum better than others, but this &quot;color tuning&quot; is often different depending on the adaptation state of the visual system. A given cell that might respond best to long-wavelength light if the light is relatively bright might then become responsive to all wavelengths if the stimulus is relatively dim. Because the color tuning of these cells is not stable, some believe that a different, relatively small, population of neurons in V1 is responsible for color vision. These specialized &quot;color cells&quot; often have receptive fields that can compute local cone ratios. Such &quot;double-opponent&quot; cells were initially described in the goldfish retina by Nigel Daw; their existence in primates was suggested by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, first demonstrated by C.R. Michael and subsequently confirmed by Bevil Conway. As Margaret Livingstone and David Hubel showed, double opponent cells are clustered within localized regions of V1 called blobs, and are thought to come in two flavors, red–green and blue-yellow. Red–green cells compare the relative amounts of red–green in one part of a scene with the amount of red–green in an adjacent part of the scene, responding best to local color contrast (red next to green). Modeling studies have shown that double-opponent cells are ideal candidates for the neural machinery of color constancy explained by Edwin H. Land in his retinex theory.
From the V1 blobs, color information is sent to cells in the second visual area, V2. The cells in V2 that are most strongly color tuned are clustered in the &quot;thin stripes&quot; that, like the blobs in V1, stain for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (separating the thin stripes are interstripes and thick stripes, which seem to be concerned with other visual information like motion and high-resolution form). Neurons in V2 then synapse onto cells in the extended V4. This area includes not only V4, but two other areas in the posterior inferior temporal cortex, anterior to area V3, the dorsal posterior inferior temporal cortex, and posterior TEO. Area V4 was initially suggested by Semir Zeki to be exclusively dedicated to color, and he later showed that V4 can be subdivided into subregions with very high concentrations of color cells separated from each other by zones with lower concentration of such cells though even the latter cells respond better to some wavelengths than to others, a finding confirmed by subsequent studies. The presence in V4 of orientation-selective cells led to the view that V4 is involved in processing both color and form associated with color but it is worth noting that the orientation selective cells within V4 are more broadly tuned than their counterparts in V1, V2 and V3. Color processing in the extended V4 occurs in millimeter-sized color modules called globs. This is the part of the brain in which color is first processed into the full range of hues found in color space.

Anatomical studies have shown that neurons in extended V4 provide input to the inferior temporal lobe. &quot;IT&quot; cortex is thought to integrate color information with shape and form, although it has been difficult to define the appropriate criteria for this claim. Despite this murkiness, it has been useful to characterize this pathway (V1 &gt; V2 &gt; V4 &gt; IT) as the ventral stream or the &quot;what pathway&quot;, distinguished from the dorsal stream (&quot;where pathway&quot;) that is thought to analyze motion, among other features.

== Subjectivity of color perception ==

Color is a feature of visual perception by an observer. There is a complex relationship between the wavelengths of light in the visual spectrum and human experiences of color. Although most people are assumed to have the same mapping, the philosopher John Locke recognized that alternatives are possible, and described one such hypothetical case with the &quot;inverted spectrum&quot; thought experiment. For example, someone with an inverted spectrum might experience green while seeing &#x27;red&#x27; (700 nm) light, and experience red while seeing &#x27;green&#x27; (530 nm) light. This inversion has never been demonstrated in experiment, though.

Synesthesia (or ideasthesia) provides some atypical but illuminating examples of subjective color experience triggered by input that is not even light, such as sounds or shapes. The possibility of a clean dissociation between color experience from properties of the world reveals that color is a subjective psychological phenomenon.

The Himba people have been found to categorize colors differently from most Westerners and are able to easily distinguish close shades of green, barely discernible for most people. The Himba have created a very different color scheme which divides the spectrum to dark shades (&quot;zuzu&quot; in Himba), very light (&quot;vapa&quot;), vivid blue and green (&quot;buru&quot;) and dry colors as an adaptation to their specific way of life.

The perception of color depends heavily on the context in which the perceived object is presented.

Psychophysical experiments have shown that color is perceived before the orientation of lines and directional motion by as much as 40ms and 80 ms respectively, thus leading to a perceptual asynchrony that is demonstrable with brief presentation times.

=== Chromatic adaptation ===
In color vision, chromatic adaptation refers to color constancy; the ability of the visual system to preserve the appearance of an object under a wide range of light sources. For example, a white page under blue, pink, or purple light will reflect mostly blue, pink, or purple light to the eye, respectively; the brain, however, compensates for the effect of lighting (based on the color shift of surrounding objects) and is more likely to interpret the page as white under all three conditions, a phenomenon known as color constancy.

In color science, chromatic adaptation is the estimation of the representation of an object under a different light source from the one in which it was recorded. A common application is to find a &quot;chromatic adaptation transform&quot; (CAT) that will make the recording of a neutral object appear neutral (color balance), while keeping other colors also looking realistic. For example, chromatic adaptation transforms are used when converting images between ICC profiles with different white points. Adobe Photoshop, for example, uses the Bradford CAT.

== Color vision in nonhumans ==
Many species can see light with frequencies outside the human &quot;visible spectrum&quot;. Bees and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them to find nectar in flowers. Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to ultraviolet &quot;colors&quot; and patterns rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Birds, too, can see into the ultraviolet (300–400 nm), and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range. Many animals that can see into the ultraviolet range, however, cannot see red light or any other reddish wavelengths. For example, bees&#x27; visible spectrum ends at about 590 nm, just before the orange wavelengths start. Birds, however, can see some red wavelengths, although not as far into the light spectrum as humans. It is a myth that the common goldfish is the only animal that can see both infrared and ultraviolet light; their color vision extends into the ultraviolet but not the infrared.

The basis for this variation is the number of cone types that differ between species. Mammals, in general, have a color vision of a limited type, and usually have red–green color blindness, with only two types of cones. Humans, some primates, and some marsupials see an extended range of colors, but only by comparison with other mammals. Most non-mammalian vertebrate species distinguish different colors at least as well as humans, and many species of birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and some invertebrates, have more than three cone types and probably superior color vision to humans.

In most Catarrhini (Old World monkeys and apes—primates closely related to humans), there are three types of color receptors (known as cone cells), resulting in trichromatic color vision. These primates, like humans, are known as trichromats. Many other primates (including New World monkeys) and other mammals are dichromats, which is the general color vision state for mammals that are active during the day (i.e., felines, canines, ungulates). Nocturnal mammals may have little or no color vision. Trichromat non-primate mammals are rare.

Many invertebrates have color vision. Honeybees and bumblebees have trichromatic color vision which is insensitive to red but sensitive to ultraviolet. &quot;Osmia rufa&quot;, for example, possess a trichromatic color system, which they use in foraging for pollen from flowers. In view of the importance of color vision to bees one might expect these receptor sensitivities to reflect their specific visual ecology; for example the types of flowers that they visit. However, the main groups of hymenopteran insects excluding ants (i.e., bees, wasps and sawflies) mostly have three types of photoreceptor, with spectral sensitivities similar to the honeybee&#x27;s.&quot; Papilio&quot; butterflies possess six types of photoreceptors and may have pentachromatic vision. The most complex color vision system in the animal kingdom has been found in stomatopods (such as the mantis shrimp) having between 12 and 16 spectral receptor types thought to work as multiple dichromatic units.

Vertebrate animals such as tropical fish and birds sometimes have more complex color vision systems than humans; thus the many subtle colors they exhibit generally serve as direct signals for other fish or birds, and not to signal mammals. In bird vision, tetrachromacy is achieved through up to four cone types, depending on species. Each single cone contains one of the four main types of vertebrate cone photopigment (LWS/ MWS, RH2, SWS2 and SWS1) and has a colored oil droplet in its inner segment. Brightly colored oil droplets inside the cones shift or narrow the spectral sensitivity of the cell. Pigeons may be pentachromats.

Reptiles and amphibians also have four cone types (occasionally five), and probably see at least the same number of colors that humans do, or perhaps more. In addition, some nocturnal geckos and frogs have the capability of seeing color in dim light. At least some color-guided behaviors in amphibians have also been shown to be wholly innate, developing even in visually deprived animals.

In the evolution of mammals, segments of color vision were lost, then for a few species of primates, regained by gene duplication. Eutherian mammals other than primates (for example, dogs, mammalian farm animals) generally have less-effective two-receptor (dichromatic) color perception systems, which distinguish blue, green, and yellow—but cannot distinguish oranges and reds. There is some evidence that a few mammals, such as cats, have redeveloped the ability to distinguish longer wavelength colors, in at least a limited way, via one-amino-acid mutations in opsin genes. The adaptation to see reds is particularly important for primate mammals, since it leads to the identification of fruits, and also newly sprouting reddish leaves, which are particularly nutritious.

However, even among primates, full color vision differs between New World and Old World monkeys. Old World primates, including monkeys and all apes, have vision similar to humans. New World monkeys may or may not have color sensitivity at this level: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats. Visual sensitivity differences between males and females in a single species is due to the gene for yellow-green sensitive opsin protein (which confers ability to differentiate red from green) residing on the X sex chromosome.

Several marsupials, such as the fat-tailed dunnart (&quot;Sminthopsis crassicaudata&quot;), have trichromatic color vision.

Marine mammals, adapted for low-light vision, have only a single cone type and are thus monochromats.

== Evolution ==
Color perception mechanisms are highly dependent on evolutionary factors, of which the most prominent is thought to be satisfactory recognition of food sources. In herbivorous primates, color perception is essential for finding proper (immature) leaves. In hummingbirds, particular flower types are often recognized by color as well. On the other hand, nocturnal mammals have less-developed color vision since adequate light is needed for cones to function properly. There is evidence that ultraviolet light plays a part in color perception in many branches of the animal kingdom, especially insects. In general, the optical spectrum encompasses the most common electronic transitions in matter and is therefore the most useful for collecting information about the environment.

The evolution of trichromatic color vision in primates occurred as the ancestors of modern monkeys, apes, and humans switched to diurnal (daytime) activity and began consuming fruits and leaves from flowering plants. Color vision, with UV discrimination, is also present in a number of arthropods—the only terrestrial animals besides the vertebrates to possess this trait.

Some animals can distinguish colors in the ultraviolet spectrum. The UV spectrum falls outside the human visible range, except for some cataract surgery patients. Birds, turtles, lizards, many fish and some rodents have UV receptors in their retinas. These animals can see the UV patterns found on flowers and other wildlife that are otherwise invisible to the human eye.

Ultraviolet vision is an especially important adaptation in birds. It allows birds to spot small prey from a distance, navigate, avoid predators, and forage while flying at high speeds. Birds also utilize their broad spectrum vision to recognize other birds, and in sexual selection.

== Mathematics of color perception ==

A &quot;physical color&quot; is a combination of pure spectral colors (in the visible range). In principle there exist infinitely many distinct spectral colors, and so the set of all physical colors may be thought of as an infinite-dimensional vector space (a Hilbert space). This space is typically notated &quot;H&quot;color. More technically, the space of physical colors may be considered to be the topological cone over the simplex whose vertices are the spectral colors, with white at the centroid of the simplex, black at the apex of the cone, and the monochromatic color associated with any given vertex somewhere along the line from that vertex to the apex depending on its brightness.

An element &quot;C&quot; of &quot;H&quot;color is a function from the range of visible wavelengths—considered as an interval of real numbers [&quot;W&quot;min,&quot;W&quot;max]—to the real numbers, assigning to each wavelength &quot;w&quot; in [&quot;W&quot;min,&quot;W&quot;max] its intensity &quot;C&quot;(&quot;w&quot;).

A humanly perceived color may be modeled as three numbers: the extents to which each of the 3 types of cones is stimulated. Thus a humanly perceived color may be thought of as a point in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. We call this space R3color.

Since each wavelength &quot;w&quot; stimulates each of the 3 types of cone cells to a known extent, these extents may be represented by 3 functions &quot;s&quot;(&quot;w&quot;), &quot;m&quot;(&quot;w&quot;), &quot;l&quot;(&quot;w&quot;) corresponding to the response of the &quot;S&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;L&quot; cone cells, respectively.

Finally, since a beam of light can be composed of many different wavelengths, to determine the extent to which a physical color &quot;C&quot; in &quot;H&quot;color stimulates each cone cell, we must calculate the integral (with respect to &quot;w&quot;), over the interval [&quot;W&quot;min,&quot;W&quot;max], of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;w&quot;)·&quot;s&quot;(&quot;w&quot;), of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;w&quot;)·&quot;m&quot;(&quot;w&quot;), and of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;w&quot;)·&quot;l&quot;(&quot;w&quot;). The triple of resulting numbers associates with each physical color &quot;C&quot; (which is an element in &quot;H&quot;color) a particular perceived color (which is a single point in R3color). This association is easily seen to be linear. It may also easily be seen that many different elements in the &quot;physical&quot; space &quot;H&quot;color can all result in the same single perceived color in R3color, so a perceived color is not unique to one physical color.

Thus human color perception is determined by a specific, non-unique linear mapping from the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;color to the 3-dimensional Euclidean space R3color.

Technically, the image of the (mathematical) cone over the simplex whose vertices are the spectral colors, by this linear mapping, is also a (mathematical) cone in R3color. Moving directly away from the vertex of this cone represents maintaining the same chromaticity while increasing its intensity. Taking a cross-section of this cone yields a 2D chromaticity space. Both the 3D cone and its projection or cross-section are convex sets; that is, any mixture of spectral colors is also a color.

In practice, it would be quite difficult to physiologically measure an individual&#x27;s three cone responses to various physical color stimuli. Instead, a psychophysical approach is taken. Three specific benchmark test lights are typically used; let us call them &quot;S&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;L&quot;. To calibrate human perceptual space, scientists allowed human subjects to try to match any physical color by turning dials to create specific combinations of intensities (&quot;I&quot;&quot;S&quot;, &quot;I&quot;&quot;M&quot;, &quot;I&quot;&quot;L&quot;) for the &quot;S&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;L&quot; lights, resp., until a match was found. This needed only to be done for physical colors that are spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (&quot;I&quot;&quot;S&quot;, &quot;I&quot;&quot;M&quot;, &quot;I&quot;&quot;L&quot;) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of &quot;S&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;L&quot; would have to be added with some intensity to the &quot;physical test color&quot;, and that combination matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. Across different individuals (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be nearly identical.

By considering all the resulting combinations of intensities (&quot;I&quot;&quot;S&quot;, &quot;I&quot;&quot;M&quot;, &quot;I&quot;&quot;L&quot;) as a subset of 3-space, a model for human perceptual color space is formed. (Note that when one of &quot;S&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;L&quot; had to be added to the test color, its intensity was counted as negative.) Again, this turns out to be a (mathematical) cone, not a quadric, but rather all rays through the origin in 3-space passing through a certain convex set. Again, this cone has the property that moving directly away from the origin corresponds to increasing the intensity of the &quot;S&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;L&quot; lights proportionately. Again, a cross-section of this cone is a planar shape that is (by definition) the space of &quot;chromaticities&quot; (informally: distinct colors); one particular such cross-section, corresponding to constant &quot;X&quot;+&quot;Y&quot;+&quot;Z&quot; of the CIE 1931 color space, gives the CIE chromaticity diagram.

This system implies that for any hue or non-spectral color not on the boundary of the chromaticity diagram, there are infinitely many distinct physical spectra that are all perceived as that hue or color. So, in general, there is no such thing as &quot;the&quot; combination of spectral colors that we perceive as (say) a specific version of tan; instead, there are infinitely many possibilities that produce that exact color. The boundary colors that are pure spectral colors can be perceived only in response to light that is purely at the associated wavelength, while the boundary colors on the &quot;line of purples&quot; can each only be generated by a specific ratio of the pure violet and the pure red at the ends of the visible spectral colors.

The CIE chromaticity diagram is horseshoe-shaped, with its curved edge corresponding to all spectral colors (the &quot;spectral locus&quot;), and the remaining straight edge corresponding to the most saturated purples, mixtures of red and violet.

<text>Alan Fred Titchmarsh (born 2 May 1949) is an English gardener and broadcaster. After working as a professional gardener and a gardening journalist, he became a writer, and a radio and television presenter.

==Early career==
Alan Fred Titchmarsh was born on 2 May 1949 in Ilkley, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. He is the son of Bessie (&quot;née&quot; Hardisty), a textile mill worker, and Alan Fred Titchmarsh senior, a plumber. In 1964, after leaving school at 15, with one O-level in Art, Titchmarsh went to work as an apprentice gardener with Ilkley Council, before leaving in 1968, at 18, for Shipley Art and Technology Institute in Shipley in the West Riding of Yorkshire to study for a City and Guilds in horticulture.

Titchmarsh went on to study at Hertfordshire College of Agriculture and Horticulture for the National Certificate in Horticulture, before finally moving to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew to study for a Diploma in Horticulture. After graduating he stayed on at Kew, employed as a supervisor and later as a staff trainer. He left to pursue a career in gardening journalism in 1974. Interested in English literature and writing, he applied for a post with the publisher Hamlyn Publishing, as assistant editor of gardening books. He then started to write his own gardening books, with the first published in 1976.

==Television and radio==
In 1988 Titchmarsh hosted the gardening show with &quot;House in a Garden&quot; on BBC Radio 2. 
Titchmarsh&#x27;s first television appearances were on the BBC television show &quot;Nationwide&quot; as a horticulture expert. This led to his presenting of the Chelsea Flower Show for BBC television in 1983. Titchmarsh hosted this every year until 2013. He also appeared on other BBC shows, such as &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; and &quot;Open Air&quot; as either a guest presenter or as a gardening expert.

In 1991 Titchmarsh hosted the BBC television talk show &quot;Pebble Mill&quot;, which he did until its cancellation in 1996. In 1991 he presented a six part series in which he followed in the footsteps of the pilgrims, travelling around Britain and Ireland.

In 1996 Titchmarsh took over as host of &quot;Gardeners&#x27; World&quot;, the show being filmed in his own garden. In 1997 he hosted the BBC One television series, &quot;Ground Force&quot;, in which he and fellow presenters Charlie Dimmock and Tommy Walsh would perform a makeover on a garden. After &quot;Gardeners&#x27; World&quot; Titchmarsh has presented two series of &quot;How To Be A Gardener&quot;.

Away from gardening, Titchmarsh has had spells presenting &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; and a series of programmes on BBC Radio 2 in which he played a selection of light classical music, as well as a BBC nature documentary series, &quot;British Isles - A Natural History&quot;. 
Titchmarsh has appeared in adverts, including working for the Yorkshire Tourist Board (now Welcome To Yorkshire). He voiced the title character in &quot;Gordon the Garden Gnome&quot;, a cartoon series for the CBeebies channel. In 2007 Titchmarsh hosted a follow-up series to &quot;British Isles – A Natural History&quot; entitled &quot;The Nature of Britain&quot; focusing on British plant and animal species.

He hosted the &quot;20th Century Roadshow&quot;, a 2005 special edition of the &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;; performing in the 2006 Children&#x27;s Party at the Palace for the Queen&#x27;s 80th birthday; and guest hosting an episode of &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;. In 2007 Titchmarsh hosted &quot;The Great British Village Show&quot;. He also presented the afternoon ITV chat show &quot;The Alan Titchmarsh Show&quot; (2007–2014). In 2006 Titchmarsh was given a permanent slot on BBC Radio 2 on Sunday evenings with the show &quot;Melodies for you&quot;. 

In 2010 Titchmarsh presented the first series of &quot;Popstar to Operastar&quot; with Myleene Klass. Since 2011, he has presented gardening show &quot;Love Your Garden&quot;. In June 2012 he presented &quot;Elizabeth: Queen, Wife, Mother&quot; on ITV. In August 2011, Titchmarsh left Radio 2. Since January 2012, he has hosted a Saturday morning show on Classic FM.

In 2013, Titchmarsh, then aged 64, responded to complaints that older women were discriminated against on television by stating he would like to hear less &quot;whingeing&quot;. &quot;They don&#x27;t complain in their early days when they are disporting themselves on sports cars&quot;, he stated in an interview with &quot;The Observer&quot;. This drew criticism from media figures who had been protesting against the difficulties faced by older women in the media, including from Miriam O&#x27;Reilly, winner of an age discrimination case against the BBC.

Titchmarsh was reported to have commented favourably on the UK Independence Party&#x27;s Nigel Farage in 2013 and in 2014, saying he had “some sympathy with the clarion wake-up call they’re trying to give the country”. However, during an interview in 2017 in support of a refugee charity, he said his comments had been misunderstood.

In 2013 Titchmarsh was a reporter on BBC Two programme &quot;The Great British Winter&quot;. In 2014 Titchmarsh presented &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Garden&quot;, a two-part series for ITV, that was filmed over one year. In 2015 Titchmarsh presented &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Back Gardens&quot;. In February 2016, Titchmarsh began presenting the daytime game show &quot;Masterpiece&quot; for ITV. In 2017 the Channel Five programme &quot;Secrets of the National Trust&quot; started airing with Alan Titchmarsh as the main presenter.

In March 2024, it was widely reported in the UK press that Titchmarsh&#x27;s trousers were censored on Korean Central Television (North Korea television). Titchmarsh was wearing jeans in the Secret Gardens programme, and jeans are banned in North Korea as they are considered a sign of western imperialism. Speaking to the BBC, Titchmarsh said the news had given him &quot;a bit of street cred.&quot; In April this was suspected to be a hoax by Joe Lycett for &quot;Late Night Lycett&quot; but in the first episode, Lycett confirmed he was not behind the story. And when it aired on KCTV, It featured a Korean language voice-over (Despite Alan Titchmarsh&#x27;s English speaking still being clearly heard). And it was the only voice-over to exist, as the show was never dubbed in other countries.

==Writing==
His first novel was &quot;Mr MacGregor&quot; in 1998. Since then, he has written over a dozen novels. &quot;Nobbut A Lad: A Yorkshire Childhood&quot; (2006) was an autobiographical work, followed by &quot;Trowel &amp; Error&quot; (2002) and &quot;When I Was A Nipper&quot; (2010).

Titchmarsh has also published a series of gardening guides, the &quot;How to Garden&quot; series (2009).

==Personal life==
Titchmarsh married Alison in 1975 and they have two children. In 2002 he and his wife moved into a grade II listed Georgian Hampshire farmhouse, with a garden of . He also has a coastal home, near Cowes on the Isle of Wight, where he spends about a third of the year.

<doc id="302827" wikidata="Q374949" url="?curid=302827" title="Andrew Peacock">
<text>Andrew Sharp Peacock (13 February 193916 April 2021) was an Australian politician and diplomat. He served as a cabinet minister and went on to become leader of the Liberal Party on two occasions (1983–1985 and 1989–1990), leading the party to defeat at the 1984 and 1990 elections.

Peacock was born in Melbourne and attended Elsternwick Primary School and Scotch College before studying law at the University of Melbourne. A former president of the Young Liberals, he was elected to Parliament at the age of 27, filling the blue-ribbon seat of Kooyong, vacated by Sir Robert Menzies. Peacock was appointed to cabinet in 1969 by John Gorton and later served under William McMahon and Malcolm Fraser. He held a variety of portfolios, most notably serving as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1975 to 1980. He unsuccessfully challenged Fraser for the Liberal leadership in 1982, but was then elected as Fraser&#x27;s successor following the party&#x27;s defeat at the 1983 election.

At the 1984 election, the Peacock-led Coalition slightly reduced the Labor Party&#x27;s majority. He resigned the Liberal leadership the following year after failing to have his deputy John Howard removed; he was duly replaced by Howard. He remained a member of the shadow cabinet, and in 1987 unsuccessfully challenged Howard for the leadership; he was instead elected deputy leader. Peacock returned as leader in 1989. However, his second term lasted less than a year, as he resigned after another electoral defeat in 1990; he had won the popular vote but failed to win enough seats. Peacock left politics in 1994 and was later appointed Ambassador to the United States, serving from 1997 to 1999.

==Early life==
Peacock was born on 13 February 1939 in Melbourne, Victoria, the son of Andrew Sharp Peacock Sr and his wife, Iris Lamb. His father was a marine engineer and one of the founders of Peacock and Smith Ltd, a large shipbuilding firm. He was educated at Scotch College and at the University of Melbourne, where he graduated in law. In 1963, he married Susan Rossiter (1942–2016), the daughter of Victorian Liberal MLA Sir John Rossiter. They had three daughters, including the horse trainer Jane Chapple-Hyam.

==Early political career==
Peacock unsuccessfully contested the seat of Yarra in the 1961 federal election, although he bucked the national trend by increasing the Liberal primary vote, impressing party elders. He was president of the Young Liberals in 1962, and by 1965 he was president of the Victorian Liberal Party.

In February 1966, former prime minister Sir Robert Menzies resigned, triggering a by-election in Kooyong, the eastern Melbourne electorate that he had held for 32 years. Peacock gained Liberal preselection, making him the favourite in this comfortably safe Liberal seat. The Liberals (and their predecessors) had held the seat since Federation in 1901, usually without serious difficulty. As expected, he won 2 April by-election, albeit with a slightly reduced majority. He easily retained his seat in the general election held seven months later.

==Ministerial career==

In November 1969 Peacock was appointed to the Second Gorton Ministry as Minister for the Army, and in this role played a minor part in the drama which brought down then prime minister John Gorton in 1971. In 1972, William McMahon made him Minister for Territories, in charge of Australia&#x27;s colonial possession, Papua New Guinea, where he was responsible for bringing in self-government.

When the Liberals went into opposition in December 1972, Peacock became a senior member of the Liberal frontbench. As a party moderate, he was a supporter of the new leader, Billy Snedden. When Snedden lost the 1974 election, Peacock began to be seen as a leadership candidate, but it was Malcolm Fraser who took the initiative and deposed Snedden in 1975. Fraser made Peacock foreign affairs spokesperson, and when Fraser became caretaker prime minister, Peacock became minister for foreign affairs, a position he retained when Fraser led the Liberals to victory in the subsequent December 1975 election. Peacock said before the 1975 election that &quot;the US has no needs to take sides&quot; because the ANZUS treaty had bipartisan support.

He served as foreign minister until 1980. He had a number of acrimonious disputes with Fraser, particularly over the recognition of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. After the 1980 election he asked for a change of portfolio, and Fraser made him Minister for Industrial Relations in a swap with Tony Street. He also challenged for the deputy leadership against incumbent Phillip Lynch, but was defeated 47 votes to 35. In April 1981 he resigned suddenly, accusing Fraser of constant interference in his portfolio. Fraser called a party meeting, at which Peacock tried to depose him as party leader and therefore prime minister. Fraser managed to fend off this challenge. John Howard succeeded Lynch as deputy leader in the same meeting. Peacock returned to cabinet in October 1982, replacing the retiring Lynch as Minister for Industry and Commerce and holding that position until the defeat of the Fraser government.

==Leader of the Liberal Party==
Fraser&#x27;s government was defeated in the March 1983 election by the Labor Party under Bob Hawke. Fraser immediately retired from politics, and Peacock contested the party leadership, defeating Howard, who remained as deputy leader.

As opposition leader, Peacock faced an uphill battle against the hugely popular Hawke.

Unlike the previous time his party was in opposition between 1972 and 1975, first led by Billy Snedden and then by Malcolm Fraser, Peacock did not push for an early election. When an early election was called however in late 1984, he described it as unnecessary and accused Hawke of calling one for fear of the economy turning down in the following year 1985.

At the 1984 election he was given little chance of winning, but he performed better than expected by reducing Hawke&#x27;s majority. In 1985, as Labor&#x27;s position in opinion polls improved, Peacock&#x27;s popularity sank and Howard&#x27;s profile rose, keeping leadership speculation alive. Peacock said he would no longer accept Howard as deputy unless he offered assurances that he would not challenge for the leadership. Following Howard&#x27;s refusal to offer such an assurance, in September 1985 Peacock sought to replace him with John Moore as deputy leader. The party room re-elected Howard as deputy, contrary to Peacock&#x27;s wishes. Despite possessing greater support in the parliamentary party than Howard, Peacock resigned on 5 September 1985, concluding the situation was untenable. Howard was comfortably elected opposition leader on 5 September, and he appointed Peacock shadow foreign minister. However, after a private car-phone conversation between Peacock and then-Victorian opposition leader (and future Premier) Jeff Kennett severely attacking Howard was leaked to the press, Howard dismissed Peacock from his shadow cabinet in March 1987, calling Peacock&#x27;s actions &quot;damaging&quot; and &quot;unloyal&quot;.

Howard lost the 1987 election to Hawke, largely due to the Nationals pulling out of the Coalition in support of Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s quixotic bid to become Prime Minister. After the election, Peacock stood against Howard for the leadership losing 41 votes to 28, but was elected deputy leader in a show of party unity. Peacock&#x27;s supporters began to plot against Howard, and in May 1989 they mounted a party room coup which returned Peacock to the leadership. Peacock, now 50, cultivated a new mature image, enhanced by a second marriage to Margaret St George.

On 18 March 1990, Peacock was interviewed by Laurie Oakes on the television program &quot;Sunday&quot;, regarding his stance on the Multifunction Polis (MFP), a proposal to build a Japanese funded technology city in Australia.
Peacock attacked the MFP concept, saying it would become an Asian &quot;enclave&quot;. According to Roy Morgan Research, Peacock&#x27;s attack on the MFP did not help him politically, and the Labor Party used the issue to highlight division within the Liberal Party, as the party federal president John Elliott and others supported the MFP. The following day, &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper ran a headline titled &quot;Peacock a &#x27;danger in the Lodge&#x27;.&quot;&#x27;

At the 1990 election the Coalition won a slim majority (50.10 per cent) of the two-party vote and took seven seats from Labor. It also reduced Labor&#x27;s majority from 24 seats to nine. However, it only garnered a 0.93 per cent two-party swing. Combined with a three per cent swing against the Nationals (who saw their leader Charles Blunt ousted in his own seat), this prevented the Coalition from picking up the additional seven seats they needed to make Peacock prime minister. This was all despite Hawke&#x27;s government being in political trouble, with record high interest rates and a financial crisis in Victoria. Although Peacock was credited with helping the non-Labor forces regain much of what they had lost three years earlier, it was not enough to save his job, and he resigned after the election, promising not to make another attempt to return to the leadership. He became shadow attorney-general (1990–92) and shadow trade minister (1992–93) under the new leader, John Hewson, whom Peacock had supported in getting the job in 1990 over Peter Reith and to stop Howard returning. After Hewson&#x27;s election as leader, he endorsed Peacock as his deputy, which caused a furore with Howard supporters. Peacock, however, had no interest in becoming deputy leader again and withdrew happily. Reith was instead elected deputy in a close contest against Peacock supporter David Jull. The closeness of the deputy&#x27;s contest was seen as a reflection of the tensions in the Peacock-Howard rivalry that still existed as Reith had been Howard&#x27;s running mate when Peacock overthrew Howard almost a year earlier. This tension was not reflected in the leadership contest as both Hewson and Reith had supported Howard and Hewson was elected with a lopsided margin of 62 votes to 13 votes for Reith. Peacock believed Hewson to be the best man for the job after seeing that Hewson was a hard-working shadow treasurer.

Peacock returned to Foreign Affairs when Hewson lost the 1993 election to Paul Keating. He retained Foreign Affairs when Hewson was displaced by Alexander Downer, whom Peacock supported after Hewson initiated the May 1994 spill. Peacock believed Hewson made a mistake in calling a spill; Peacock was not aware of Hewson&#x27;s intention before it happened but decided afterwards to support Downer as he felt no longer obligated to support Hewson.

==After politics==

Peacock resigned from Parliament on 17 September 1994. In 1996, when asked about blocking John Howard, Malcolm Fraser said Peacock obviously had been, while Peacock claimed he supported John Hewson continuing. When Howard became Prime Minister in 1996, he appointed Peacock as the Australian Ambassador to the United States. Following the close of this appointment in 1999, Peacock mostly resided in the United States.

In 2002 he married Penne Percy Korth, a Washington, D.C., society figure and former United States Ambassador to Mauritius. Midway through 2002 Peacock joined Boeing Australia Holdings as President of Boeing Australia. He retired from Boeing in 2007, and joined Gold Coast-based fund manager MFS Ltd as chairman. He held the position for 15 months, resigning shortly before the firm collapsed with debts of $2.5 billion. He later stated: &quot;I should have looked more carefully at MFS before going into it. The business wasn&#x27;t going well, and I thought I could turn it around but I couldn&#x27;t.&quot;
Peacock and his American-born third wife retired to Austin, Texas, where she had gone to university. He visited Australia regularly and did not intend to become a U.S. citizen, although he held a green card. He gave up drinking after moving to the U.S., after experiencing heart problems. Peacock supported Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, after originally supporting Marco Rubio in the Republican primaries. He placed a bet on Trump to become president even before the first primary, at odds of 16–1. In a January 2018 interview with the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot;, he said he was &quot;disquieted by the first year&#x27;s performance&quot;, praising Trump&#x27;s tax cuts but expressing his disappointment with Trump&#x27;s decisions to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Peacock said that his wife is a staunch conservative and regards him as &quot;the most liberal person she&#x27;s ever met&quot;. He expressed dismay at the disappearance of moderate Republicans, and the general polarisation of American politics.

==Death and legacy==
Peacock died at his Austin home on 16 April 2021, aged 82. No cause of death was given, although it was noted by Derryn Hinch that he had &quot;significant medical problems&quot;. Obituaries took note of, and emphasised &quot;his impact on Australia&#x27;s foreign policy and international relations&quot; and described Peacock as having &quot;left an indelible mark on the country&quot;.

Upon his death, Peacock&#x27;s former rival John Howard reflected that Peacock was &quot;a hugely significant figure in Australian politics of the 70s and 80s&quot; and &quot;played a dominant role in the development of the Liberal Party&quot;, praising Peacock as a &quot;quite outstanding foreign minister&quot; who as Minister for External Territories &quot;helped lay the foundation for Papua New Guinea to become independent&quot;. His friend and former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett said that &quot;As the Colt of Kooyong he and his then wife Susan carried the aspirations of the Liberal Party&quot;, and lamented &quot;that he did not become Prime Minister of the country was probably a reflection more of his generous character more than crass ambition&quot;.

Then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison described Peacock as &quot;one of our greatest Liberals, who helped shape Australia and the Liberal Party over three decades&quot;, and praised his record as Foreign Minister, noting that &quot;he was vocal in his denunciation of the Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea, despising what he called that &#x27;loathsome regime&#x27;&quot;. Tributes were also paid by, among others, then-Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese, deputy Liberal leader Josh Frydenberg, former Liberal Prime Ministers Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott, former Labor Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, and former Opposition leader John Hewson.

Peacock was given a state memorial service at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in Melbourne on 11 February 2022; the 10 month delay being attributed to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Honours==
In the 1997 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Peacock was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia.

For his role in bringing in New Guinea independence, Peacock was appointed a Chief Grand Companion of the Order of Logohu in 2006.

In 2017, Peacock was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun by the government of Japan, &quot;for his contribution to strengthening and promoting friendly relations between Japan and Australia&quot;.

<text>Druskininkai (; also see other names) is a spa city on the Nemunas River in southern Lithuania, close to the borders of Belarus and Poland. The city of Druskininkai is known for being a spa resort since the 19th century.

==Name==
The exact origin of the city name is not certain, but it is derived from the Lithuanian word (which means &quot;salt&quot;). The name of the city in other languages includes ; ; ; .

==Geography==
The city is located at the Ratnyčia River estuary to the Nemunas River and is surrounded by a natural forest reserve. The city is situated in a picturesque landscape with rivers, lakes, hills and forests.

==History==
According to some sources the site of present-day Druskininkai was inhabited by local Yotvingian tribes in the early Middle Ages. In the 13th century the area became a part of the expanding Duchy of Lithuania. A small castle was built in the area as a part of the defence system against the Teutonic Order. In 1308 the castle was conquered by the Teutonic Knights and destroyed, causing a depopulation of the area. In 1569, the area of Druskininkai came under Polish influence.

The first written mention of Druskininkai dates back to 1636. The name of the city suggests that the local population collected minerals such as salt. In the late 18th century it was believed that minerals found in the waters of Druskininkai area produced health benefits and their usage in the medical treatment of asthma and other ailments began. In the early 19th century Ignacy Fonberger, a professor at the University of Vilnius, analyzed the chemical composition of Druskininkai&#x27;s waters and showed that they contain large amounts of Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, Iodine, Bromine, Iron and Magnesium. He also promoted the city as a holiday resort for the population of Vilnius. In the eighteenth century, the city was eagerly visited by Polish kings who treated their health ailments.

After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Druskininkai became part of the Russian Empire (Russian partition of Poland). In 1837 Tsar Nicholas I of Russia bestowed upon Druskininkai the status of a spa, and construction of pensions and hostels started. To ease communication to the spa, a ferry service on the Nemunas was started. The spa became popular in many parts of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1862 the Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway was opened and Druskininkai&#x27;s railway station was placed only from the city.

In June 1887, a Jewish national conference was held in Druskininkai led by Leon Pinsker and Moses Lilienblum which discussed ideas that played an important role in the development of the Zionist movement.

By the beginning of the 20th century the Druskininkai spa was one of the most popular resorts in the area and a place of summer residence for the middle class of Vilnius, Warsaw and Moscow.

After World War I the city became part of Poland. Its popularity was increased by the patronage of Józef Piłsudski, who spent most of his summer holidays there and promoted the development of the area. Soon most of the resort was bought up by the state-owned &quot;Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego&quot; and the construction of luxurious villas and pensions started. According to the first Polish census of 1921, Druskininkai was inhabited by 989 people, among whom 646 were Roman Catholic, 46 Orthodox, 3 Evangelical and 294 Jewish. At the same time, 700 inhabitants declared Polish nationality, 8 Belarusian, 242 Jewish, 20 Russian and only 19 Lithuanian. There were 308 residential buildings here. In 1934 a railway link with the train station was opened and the city became more accessible to the general public. It was a gmina center in Grodno powiat of Białystok Voivodeship.

After Poland was invaded in September 1939, the city was briefly incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR as raion center in Belastok Region. However, on 7 September 1940, Stalin transferred Druskininkai to Lithuania which in turn was annexed in August of that year and incorporated into the Soviet Union. It was occupied by Nazi Germany on 23 June 1941 and was part of Bezirk Bialystok. At this period, and as part of the &quot;Final Solution&quot; plan of the Nazis, the Jewish community of the city was wiped out. Some of the Jews were sent to ghettos in near-by Kaunas, and the remainder murdered by the Nazis. It was taken again by Red Army on 14 July 1944 and remained part of Lithuania under the Soviet occupation. In 1951, Druskininkai began to grow rapidly again and several huge sanatoriums and spa hospitals were opened. Over the time, the city became a major resort, attracting around 400,000 visitors.

==Landmarks and culture==
Despite damage inflicted during World War I, the city features houses and villas reflecting all periods of its development – Russian, Polish and Lithuanian.

<text>Marijampolė (; also known by several other names) is the capital of the Marijampolė County in the south of Lithuania, bordering Poland and Russian Kaliningrad Oblast, and Lake Vištytis. The city&#x27;s population stood at approximately 48,700 in 2003. It is the cultural centre and largest settlement of the historical region of Suvalkija (Sudovia).

Marijampolė is the seventh-largest city in Lithuania and has been a regional center since 1994. The city covers an area equal to . The Šešupė River divides the city into two parts which are connected by six bridges.

The city is known for the international art and architecture symposium &quot;Malonny&quot;, an event which focuses on street art, murals, and public installations, transforming Marijampolės urban spaces into an open-air art gallery.

==Names==
The city has also been known as: מאַריאַמפּאָל (Yiddish); Marijampolis, Mariampol; Starapole; Pašešupiai; Marjampol; Mariyampole; and Kapsukas (1955–1989).

==History==
The settlement was founded as a village called &quot;Pašešupė&quot;, after the nearby river of Šešupė. As such the town was first mentioned in 1667. In the 18th century the village, at that time belonging to the Catholic Church, grew to become a market town and its name was changed to Starpol or &quot;Staropole&quot;, after a new village built for Prienai starost&#x27;s guards in the vicinity in 1739. The settlement was destroyed by a fire in 1765.

After the disaster, the wife of contemporary starost of Prienai, Franciska Butler, née Ščiuka, financed a new church and a monastery for the Congregation of Marian Fathers. Following the foundation of the monastery, a new town was built in the area. It was named &quot;Maryampol&quot;, after the Blessed Virgin Mary (&quot;Marya-&quot;), with the Greek suffix &quot;-pol&quot; denoting a town.

On 23 February 1792 King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stanisław II Augustus granted the &quot;townlet of Mariampol&quot; with Magdeburg Law and a privilege of market organisation. Following the Partitions of Poland the town was briefly part of Prussia. However, after the Napoleonic Wars it was transferred to Congress Poland (&quot;Russian Poland&quot;). In the 19th century the town continued to grow, mostly thanks to a large number of Jewish and German settlers. In 1817 the town became the seat of a separate powiat within the administrative system of the kingdom. In 1827 the town had 1759 inhabitants. By 1861 the number had grown to 3718, 3015 of them being Jewish. A fire consumed many wooden homes in 1868. As a result, many houses were rebuilt of stone.
Following the January Uprising and the Russian suppression of the former Commonwealth lands, the powiat of Maryampol was seriously diminished. Around that time also the monastery gained prominence as it was the only monastery owned by the Marians that was not closed down by the tsarist authorities. As the surroundings of the town were primarily inhabited by Lithuanians, the town became the centre of the Lithuanian national revival. The proximity of the Prussian border made the smuggling of books in Lithuanian language, banned in Imperial Russia, easier. Among the most notable Lithuanian scholars and writers active in Mariampol at that time were Kazys Grinius, Jonas Jablonskis and Vincas Kudirka.

Following World War I, the town became part of the restored Lithuania and the name was standardized to its current form &quot;Marijampolė&quot;.

During World War II Marijampolė was occupied by the Soviet Union. During 1940–1941 Soviet authorities deported several hundred inhabitants of Marijampolė. In 1941 Nazi Germany occupied the town. On 1 September 1941, between 5,000 and 8,000 Jews from Marijampolė, Kalvarija and elsewhere, along with people from other backgrounds, were murdered by Germans and Lithuanian policemen. Their bodies were placed in mass graves near the Šešupė River. During the war, the town was heavily damaged and almost emptied. 

On July 31, 1944 Soviet army once again entered the city. The following year its counter-intelligence SMERSH repressed about 500 people from Marijampolė. During the first years of Soviet occupation in 1944–1953 Soviet deportations from Lithuania to Siberian gulags included somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 Lithuanians from Marijampolė county. In late postwar years the city was rebuilt and repopulated with inhabitants from other parts of Lithuania. About 98% of Marijampolė&#x27;s inhabitants are ethnic Lithuanians.

On 9 April 1955 Communist authorities of the Lithuanian SSR renamed the town &quot;Kapsukas&quot; after a Lithuanian Communist politician Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas. The old name was restored in 1989, the year before Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union.

Marijampolė has been the administrative centre of the county since 1994. In 2018, in the 100th anniversary of the restoration of the independence of Lithuania, the city of Marijampolė became the cultural capital of Lithuania.

The Anshe Sholom B&#x27;nai Israel synagogue in Chicago was founded by immigrants from Marijampolė. Other Jewish migrants from Marijampolė settled in Manchester and Leeds, United Kingdom.

==Transport==
Marijampolė is accessible by railway via the Kaunas-Šeštokai-Alytus line. The town is located at the crossroads of two major highways: The Via Baltica connects Helsinki with Central and Southern Europe, and the European route E28, which runs between Berlin, Germany, and Minsk, Belarus.

==Industry and economy==

Marijampolė is connected to its partners by business, sport, education, tourism, and other ties. Marijampolė&#x27;s local means of mass media include a local television station, a local radio station, the newspapers &quot;Marijampolės laikraštis&quot;, &quot;Suvalkietis&quot;, &quot;TV savaitė&quot;, &quot;Sugrįžimai&quot;, and magazine &quot;Suvalkija&quot;. Culturally, Marijampolė enjoys one cinema and a municipal drama theater.

Marijampolė is a regional centre of light industry enterprises, construction, transport and trade. It has also become home to one of the largest second-hand car markets in Europe.

==Education==
Marijampolė has a strong educational system with state education institutions. The city is the seat of Marijampolė University of Applied Sciences as well as of nine pre-school institutions, six nursery schools, one primary school, 12 lower secondary schools, nine secondary schools, four gymnasiums, a youth school, an adult education center, five additional training establishments, three non-state education institutions, a music school of Christian Culture, the Gymnasium of Marijonai, and the &quot;R. Vosylienė&quot; languages school.

==Marijampolė Municipality==

Marijampolė has a City Council with 27 members. The members of the City Council represent different Lithuanian political parties.

The Marijampolė Municipality is adjacent to the Vilkaviškis District Municipality in the west, Kazlų Rūda Municipality in the north, Kalvarija Municipality in the south, and the Prienai District Municipality and Alytus District Municipality in the east.

The town of Marijampolė and its six surrounding communities make up the territory of Marijampolė Municipality.

<doc id="302838" wikidata="Q904008" url="?curid=302838" title="Breath of Fire">
<text>Breath of Fire is a role-playing video game series developed by Capcom. It originated on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. The series has recurring characters and ambiguous continuity; though each game is its own self-contained story, the names of the two lead characters are usually Ryu and Nina.

The story commonly involves an adventurer named Ryu (name usually changeable) who can shapeshift into different types of dragons. Over the course of his journey, he befriends Nina, a girl with wings. At its inception, &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; took place in a medieval fantasy style fictional world. Following the mainstream success of Japanese role-playing games in the 1990s, the series began using the original anime-style artwork for later Western releases of the games (rather than the Westernized art that was drawn specifically for the Western releases of the first two games), post-apocalyptic themes, and an increased emphasis on character development. Despite these changes, the core structure of &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; remains largely linear and plot-focused. , six &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; titles have been released, with three games being ported to handheld game consoles as well as Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console, and two ported to the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s Super NES games library. By 2022, the series had sold over 3.3 million copies.

==Games==
===Main series===
===Mobile games===

Beginning in November 2003, Capcom began releasing &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; titles specifically for mobile phone devices in Japan. Each game was developed for use on NTT DoCoMo, au, and SoftBank brand cellphones that use the i-mode, EZWEB, or BREW services. The first title, , is a replication of the Japanese card game &quot;daifugō&quot; featuring characters from &quot;Breath of Fire IV&quot;, and would be followed by a sports game called in October 2005, which contained an expanded version of the fishing minigame also from the game. Two action role-playing spin-offs of &quot;Breath of Fire IV&quot; titled and &#x27; were released in November 2007 and November 2008 respectively.

==Music==
The music of each &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; games has traditionally been produced by rotating members of Capcom&#x27;s in-house sound team. While the themes from first game were composed by five members of the company&#x27;s sound team Alph Lyla, which included Yasuaki Fujita, Mari Yamaguchi, Minae Fuji, Yoko Shimomura and Tatsuya Nishimura, the second game&#x27;s score was produced entirely by fellow company composer Yuko Takehara. &quot;Breath of Fire III&quot;″s soundtrack took a jazz-inspired approach, and was written by the team of Yoshino Aoki and Akari Kaida, with the music of &quot;Breath of Fire IV&quot; provided solely by Aoki herself. For the first time in the series, the music of &quot;Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter&quot; was created by an outside employee, Hitoshi Sakimoto, with Yasunori Mitsuda serving as music producer on the project.

In March 2006, Capcom released the 11-disc &quot;Breath of Fire Original Soundtrack Special Box&quot; boxset on their in-house record label Suleputer, which contained all music from the first five games in the series. The set includes the first-ever soundtrack release of the original &quot;Breath of Fire&quot;, as well as the first complete soundtrack releases for &quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; and &quot;Breath of Fire III&quot;, which had previously only received single-disc selections during their original printings, with a total of 307 tracks from all five titles. Capcom produced a limited run of only 2000 copies of the boxset, which was distributed on their online store e-Capcom, as well as special retailers, and included a 28-page booklet featuring art from the series.

==Reception==
As of the fifth game in the series, the &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; franchise has sold a total of 3.2 million units worldwide, with Capcom calling it their &quot;best known and most successful role-playing game.&quot; Sales of each successive title continued on an upward slope which peaked at the PlayStation entries in the series, with the fifth game, &quot;Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter&quot; on the PlayStation 2, representing a significant dip. Each title received mostly positive reviews from aggregate review websites GameRankings and Metacritic, with critics such as Gamasutra finding each game to be good, but largely formulaic, calling the franchise &quot;always solid, if not particularly ambitious&quot;. The series has routinely been compared to Square Enix&#x27;s popular &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, with GameSpot stating that &quot;Though the Breath of Fire games have never been as well received as bigger RPG names like Final Fantasy, the series indicates that Capcom is definitely learning something about the fine art of RPG development.&quot;

In May 2009, nearly seven years after the release of the latest game, &quot;Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter&quot;, readers of Japanese &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine voted the series 6th in the publication&#x27;s survey of the Top 50 Most Wanted Game Sequels. IGN would later name &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; the 4th greatest Capcom franchise of all time in June 2010, stating that &quot;Though the Breath of Fire games evolved across the SNES to the PlayStation 2, the core held steadfast to Japanese RPG formulas – something that many gamers still celebrate.&quot;

===Series future===
In a December 2008 interview with gaming website 1UP.com, Capcom&#x27;s Head of Research and Development Keiji Inafune stated the &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; series would be put on hiatus due to the company&#x27;s lack of staff and an increasingly competitive role-playing game market: &quot;There are currently no plans on making a new Breath of Fire game. Apart from that, regarding RPG titles, they are very popular in Japan, but only certain RPG titles sell so Capcom doesn&#x27;t really need to even consider making these titles as an option.&quot; Capcom USA Vice President of Strategic Planning Chris Svensson stated on the company&#x27;s official message boards in June 2009 that the series remains a &quot;resting IP&quot;. Other companies such as Camelot Software Planning have expressed interest in developing a title for the series if Capcom remained unwilling to do so.

===Appearances in other media===
Breath of Fire would later be featured in Archie Comics&#x27; &quot;Worlds Unite&quot; crossover event as one of several Capcom and Sega guest franchises appearing in the company&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and &quot;Mega Man&quot; titles.

Between August 26 - September 2, 2020, an online survey was held for &quot;Teppen&quot; players, one of the questions featured asked which Capcom characters or series the community would like to see, Breath of Fire was one of the options players could select, and it was also possible to type in specific names within the question. On July 1, 2021, Breath of Fire was added to &quot;Teppen&quot; via its Dragons of War expansion. Nina was added as a skin for the playable character Jill Valentine, she is voiced by Abby Trott (English) and Kyoko Hikami (Japanese). Her theme song is a remix of the soundtrack titled &quot;Battle for Tomorrow&quot; from &quot;Breath of Fire III&quot;. In addition, the card pack features multiple characters, enemies and concepts from Breath of Fire.

<doc id="302839" wikidata="Q9305847" url="?curid=302839" title="Neringa Municipality">
<text>Neringa () or Neringa Municipality () is a municipality of Klaipėda County in westernmost Lithuania, comprising several villages in the Curonian Spit. In terms of population, it is the smallest municipality of the country. Nida is the seat of government and largest town in Neringa Municipality.

==Etymology==
The name of the city is relatively new and is not found in old scriptures in this form. The name is derived from a German word &quot;Neringe, Nerunge, Nehrung&quot; which itself is a derivative of a curonian word &quot;nerija&quot; meaning a long peninsular spit.

Until the 2000 Lithuanian municipality reform, it was known as Neringa City, although there was never a true &quot;city&quot; there. It was made a city in the Soviet Union in 1961 by formally combining 4 settlements into one administrative unit.

==Geography==
Neringa is located south of Klaipėda, separated from the mainland Lithuania by Curonian Lagoon. It is accessible from the mainland Lithuania by ferry crossing the lagoon or overland through Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia.

The villages in Neringa municipality comprise:
*the self-governing resort town (&quot;kurortas&quot;) of Nida, seat of the local administration
*the eldership (&quot;seniūnija&quot;) of Juodkrantė
*the eldership of Preila and Pervalka.

They are tourist resorts and by then it was popular to grant more self-government to resorts.
The municipality is the only one in Lithuania which is not called after a town or city. The name Neringa was created at Soviet time for the new city municipality.

==History==
Since 1252 the region was part of the State of the Teutonic Knights, after the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466) a Polish fief. From 1701 onwards it was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany. Already in 1569 a &quot;confusion of languages&quot; was noticed: German, Lithuanian, Latvian-Curonian (Nehrungs-Kurisch) and Prussian. Nehrungs-kurisch was the language of the fishers.

Liudvikas Rėza, one of the most prominent Lithuanian language propagators and a linguist professor was born and living on the Curonian spit the 18th century, who added himself the second name – Gediminas in the honour of the Grand Duke of Lithuania.

The colours of the typical houses are handed down from the pagan religion and symbolize Divinities: Earth (brown), Sky and Water (blue), Clouds and Spray (white). At the top two crossed &quot;žirgeliai&quot; (horse heads).

The census of 1897 showed that about 60% used the Curonian language, on sea even 65%. In 1923, when sovereignty over the spit came to Lithuania, the inhabitants had problems with their nationality. Only few opted for Lithuania, many emigrated to Germany and others stayed as German &quot;resident foreigners&quot; in their villages. The result of the census of 1956: 59% Lithuanians, 21% Russians and only 15% (22 families) of the autochtone inhabitants.

==Coat of arms==
The Coat of Arms from the year 1968 shows the black and white symbols of the Klaipėda Region,
Kurenwimpel, Nida, Preila, Pervalka, Juodkrantė, Purvinė. The N stands for the new name.

<doc id="302846" wikidata="Q124743" url="?curid=302846" title="Wronskian">
<text>In mathematics, the Wronskian of &quot;n&quot; differentiable functions is the determinant formed with the functions and their derivatives up to order . It was introduced in 1812 by the Polish mathematician Józef Wroński, and is used in the study of differential equations, where it can sometimes show the linear independence of a set of solutions.

== Definition ==

The Wrońskian of two differentiable functions and is formula_1.

More generally, for real- or complex-valued functions , which are times differentiable on an interval , the Wronskian formula_2 is a function on formula_3 defined by
formula_4

This is the determinant of the matrix constructed by placing the functions in the first row, the first derivatives of the functions in the second row, and so on through the formula_5 derivative, thus forming a square matrix.

When the functions are solutions of a linear differential equation, the Wrońskian can be found explicitly using Abel&#x27;s identity, even if the functions are not known explicitly. (See below.)

== The Wronskian and linear independence ==

If the functions are linearly dependent, then so are the columns of the Wrońskian (since differentiation is a linear operation), and the Wrońskian vanishes. Thus, one may show that a set of differentiable functions is linearly independent on an interval by showing that their Wrońskian does not vanish identically. It may, however, vanish at isolated points.

A common misconception is that everywhere implies linear dependence. pointed out that the functions and have continuous derivatives and their Wrońskian vanishes everywhere, yet they are not linearly dependent in any neighborhood of . There are several extra conditions which combine with vanishing of the Wronskian in an interval to imply linear dependence.

* Maxime Bôcher observed that if the functions are analytic, then the vanishing of the Wrońskian in an interval implies that they are linearly dependent. 
* gave several other conditions for the vanishing of the Wrońskian to imply linear dependence; for example, if the Wrońskian of functions is identically zero and the Wrońskians of of them do not all vanish at any point then the functions are linearly dependent. 
* gave a more general condition that together with the vanishing of the Wronskian implies linear dependence.

Over fields of positive characteristic the Wronskian may vanish even for linearly independent polynomials; for example, the Wronskian of and 1 is identically 0.

== Application to linear differential equations ==
In general, for an formula_6th order linear differential equation, if formula_7 solutions are known, the last one can be determined by using the Wrońskian.

Consider the second order differential equation in Lagrange&#x27;s notation:
formula_8
where formula_9, formula_10 are known, and y is the unknown function to be found. Let us call formula_11 the two solutions of the equation and form their Wronskian 
formula_12

Then differentiating formula_13 and using the fact that formula_14 obey the above differential equation shows that
formula_15

Therefore, the Wronskian obeys a simple first order differential equation and can be exactly solved:
formula_16
where formula_17 and formula_18 is a constant.

Now suppose that we know one of the solutions, say formula_19. Then, by the definition of the Wrońskian, formula_20 obeys a first order differential equation:
formula_21
and can be solved exactly (at least in theory).

The method is easily generalized to higher order equations.

The relationship between the Wronskian and linear independence can also be strengthened in the context of a differential equation. If we have formula_6 linearly independent functions that are all solutions of the same monic formula_6th-order homogeneous-linear ordinary differential equation formula_24 (where formula_25 is a linear differential operator with respect to formula_26 of order less than formula_6) on some interval formula_28, then their Wronskian is zero &quot;nowhere&quot; on formula_28. Thus, counterexamples like formula_30 and formula_26 (whose Wronskian is zero everywhere) or even formula_30 and formula_33 (whose Wronskian formula_34 is zero somewhere) are ruled out; neither pair can consist of solutions to the same second-order differential equation of this type. (It&#x27;s true that formula_30 and formula_33 are both solutions to the same &quot;third&quot;-order differential equation formula_37. But the Wronskian formula_38 of the &quot;three&quot; independent solutions formula_30, formula_26, and formula_33 is nowhere zero.)

== Generalized Wrońskians ==

For functions of several variables, a generalized Wronskian is a determinant of an by matrix with entries (with ), where each is some constant coefficient linear partial differential operator of order . If the functions are linearly dependent then all generalized Wronskians vanish. As in the single variable case the converse is not true in general: if all generalized Wronskians vanish, this does not imply that the functions are linearly dependent. However, the converse is true in many special cases. For example, if the functions are polynomials and all generalized Wronskians vanish, then the functions are linearly dependent. Roth used this result about generalized Wronskians in his proof of Roth&#x27;s theorem. For more general conditions under which the converse is valid see .

== History ==
The Wrońskian was introduced by and given its current name by .

<doc id="302848" wikidata="Q1768977" url="?curid=302848" title="Fire Emblem">
<text>is a Japanese fantasy tactical role-playing game franchise developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo. First produced and published for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990, the series currently consists of seventeen core entries and five spinoffs.

The core gameplay revolves around discrete battles between the player&#x27;s team of characters and enemy non-player characters across grid-based maps. The player and enemy each take turns moving their characters across the map and having them perform combat-based actions. The games also feature a story and characters similar to traditional role-playing video games, and occasionally social simulation aspects as well. A notable aspect of gameplay is the permanent death of characters in battle, rendering them unusable upon being defeated, although this aspect of the game can be turned off starting from &quot;Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem&quot; onwards.

The series&#x27; title refers to the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;, a recurring element usually portrayed as a royal weapon or shield representing the power of war and dragons. The development of the first game began as a dōjin project by Shouzou Kaga and three other developers, and its success prompted the development of further games in the series. Kaga headed the development of each entry until the release of &quot;Thracia 776,&quot; when he left Intelligent Systems. He went on to found his own game studio, Tirnanog, who developed &quot;Tear Ring Saga&quot;.

The series debuted in the West with the seventh game &quot;The Blazing Blade&quot; in 2003, under the title &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;. According to the game&#x27;s director, this was because of the international success of the similarly turn-based &quot;Advance Wars&quot;. The inclusion of Marth and Roy in the 2001 fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; as playable characters is also cited as a reason for the series&#x27; international release. Many games in the series sold well, although sales suffered a decline during the late 2000s. This downturn resulted in the series&#x27; near-cancellation until the critical and commercial successes of &quot;Fire Emblem Awakening&quot; (2012) and &quot;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&quot; (2019).

The series has been lauded for its gameplay and is frequently cited as the seminal series in the tactical role-playing genre, codifying various gameplay elements that would come to define the genre. Characters from across the series have been included in crossovers with other video game franchises, including the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

== Common elements ==
=== Gameplay ===
&quot;Fire Emblem&quot;″s developers have described it as an &quot;RPG simulation&quot; that combines tactical simulation gameplay with the plot and character development of a role-playing game, creating a sense of connection with characters not present in previous tactical games. Battles in the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series take place on a grid-based map, with the player controlling a set number of characters across maps tied to the game&#x27;s story and optional side stories. Each character has a specific character class which gives them set abilities and affects how far they can move across the field; some classes have innate skills unique to them. Depending on the installment, a character&#x27;s class can be changed or upgraded, sometimes by using special items. During a battle, a character gains experience points by performing actions, such as attacking an enemy, healing an ally, or slaying a foe, which typically offers the most experience points. Each character has their own stats, and once a certain level is reached they level up and new skill points are awarded randomly to their attributes, such as health, agility, or strength. A character gains more experience the more they are used in battle.

A key element present in combat since &quot;Genealogy of the Holy War&quot; is the Weapon Triangle, a system governing the strengths and weaknesses that certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a rock–paper–scissors fashion. For weapons, lances have an advantage against swords, swords have an advantage against axes, and axes have an advantage against lances. In the magic system, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. From &quot;The Binding Blade&quot; through &quot;Radiant Dawn&quot;, these three elements are collectively known as anima magic. Anima is stronger than light, light is stronger than darkness, and darkness is stronger than anima. In &quot;Fates&quot;, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons: swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows are stronger than lances and shurikens, and lances and shurikens are stronger than swords and tomes. Most games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character&#x27;s weapon will break. Different installments have various systems related to weapons: in &quot;Genealogy of the Holy War&quot;, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in &quot;Path of Radiance&quot; and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded. &quot;Fates&quot; replaces the durability system with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of their wielder&#x27;s stats.

Character relationships can be developed through support affinity both inside and outside of battle, which increases certain battle abilities. A feature introduced in &quot;Genealogy of the Holy War&quot; and used in later installments is that characters who fall in love can have a child who inherits certain skills and stats from them. One of the recurring features in the series is permanent death, in which units defeated in battle are permanently removed from the party, with very few exceptions, one being the main character, whose death results in a Game Over instead. &quot;Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem&quot; introduced Casual Mode, in which dead characters are revived at the end of a battle. &quot;Fates&quot; added Phoenix Mode, in which defeated characters are revived on the player&#x27;s next turn. Another inclusion from &quot;Fates&quot; is &#x27;My Castle&#x27;, a customizable castle serving as the player&#x27;s base of operations throughout the game.

=== Story and themes ===
The &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; games take place across unrelated settings within a medieval or Renaissance-themed time period. The main protagonist, who is usually either royalty or a mercenary, is caught in the conflict of two or more countries across a continent and fighting for their cause. The continents of Archanea and Valentia are the settings of &quot;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot;, &quot;Gaiden&quot;, &quot;Mystery of the Emblem,&quot; and &quot;Awakening&quot;, and were the planned setting for &quot;Fire Emblem 64&quot;. &quot;Genealogy of the Holy War&quot; and &quot;Thracia 776&quot; are set in Jugdral, which is distantly connected with Archanea and Valentia, while &quot;The Blazing Blade&quot; and &quot;The Binding Blade&quot; take place in Elibe. &quot;The Sacred Stones&quot; is set in Magvel, and &quot;Path of Radiance&quot; and &quot;Radiant Dawn&quot; are set on the continent Tellius. &quot;Fates&quot; is set on an unnamed continent, with the story instead focusing on the two powers fighting over its territory. &quot;Three Houses&quot; takes place on the continent of Fódlan. &quot;Engage&quot; is set in the continent of Elyos.

A recurring element in the series is the titular artifact known as the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;. In &quot;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot; and other games set in Archanea, it is a shield inset with five magical gems named after its connection to dragons and weapons of war, being the &quot;emblem of flame&quot;. It also appears as a family crest in &quot;Genealogy of the Holy War&quot;, a family seal in &quot;The Binding Blade&quot;, a magic gemstone in &quot;The Sacred Stones&quot;, a bronze medallion holding a goddess of chaos in &quot;Path of Radiance&quot; and &quot;Radiant Dawn&quot;, a sword in &quot;Fates&quot;, and hereditary magical sigils in &quot;Three Houses&quot;. Other magical elements, including feuding gods and mystical species such as dragons and shapeshifters, are also recurring elements in the series.

== Development and history ==
The first &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; game, &quot;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot;, was originally never intended as a commercial game, defined by creator Shouzou Kaga as a dōjin project with three other job-holding students. However, the game&#x27;s unexpected commercial success prompted the development of more games in the series. The game was developed at Intelligent Systems, whose previous notable game was the strategy game &quot;Famicom Wars&quot;. Kaga worked on the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series until &quot;Thracia 776&quot;, when he left Intelligent Systems and began development on &quot;Tear Ring Saga&quot; for the PlayStation. After &quot;Thracia 776&quot;, the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series had several releases on portable devices. In 2001, Marth and Roy, from &quot;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot; and &quot;The Binding Blade&quot; respectively, appeared as playable characters in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;. This, alongside the international success of &quot;Advance Wars&quot;, is cited as what led to Nintendo localizing &quot;The Blazing Blade&quot; for Western regions under the title &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;. Due to its success overseas, it was decided to return the series to home consoles for &quot;Path of Radiance&quot; for the GameCube. Despite it arriving late in the GameCube&#x27;s life cycle, it provided a late boost to sales, reaffirming Nintendo&#x27;s faith in the series. By 2010, the series was suffering from declining sales and Nintendo told Intelligent Systems that if their next &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; failed to sell above 250,000 units, the series would be canceled. This prompted Intelligent Systems to include many features new to the series with the intention of making it the culmination of the entire series up to that point. The game&#x27;s reception and sales ended up saving the series from cancellation, convincing Nintendo to continue production.

The series&#x27; original music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko. As the only music composer at Intelligent Systems when &quot;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot; was in production, she acted as both composer and sound director, up until &quot;Thracia 776&quot;, when she left the company to become a freelancer after completing the score for &quot;Paper Mario&quot;. She has worked on later &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; games, alongside other composers including Saki Kasuga, Hiroki Morishita, and Rei Kondoh. The series includes several other notable staff members: Tohru Narihiro, who was involved in every &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; since the original; Masahiro Higuchi, who began as a graphics designer for &quot;Genealogy of the Holy War&quot;; and Kouhei Maeda, who wrote the scenarios for every game since &quot;The Blazing Blade&quot; and became a director for &quot;Awakening&quot;.

Multiple artists are associated with the series. The characters of &quot;Mystery of the Emblem&quot; and &quot;Genealogy of the Holy War&quot; were designed by Katsuyoshi Koya, who later worked on designs for the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; Trading Card Game. Katsuyoshi, who was unsatisfied with his work on the series, stepped down for &quot;Thracia 776&quot;. The designer for &quot;Thracia 776&quot; was Mayumi Hirota, whose brief tenure with the series ended when she left Intelligent Systems with Kaga after the game&#x27;s completion. Nevertheless, her art for the series was described by Kaga as his favorite up to that point. Other artists involved in later games are Eiji Kaneda (&quot;The Binding Blade&quot;), Sachiko Wada (&quot;The Sacred Stones&quot;) and Senri Kita (&quot;Path of Radiance&quot;, &quot;Radiant Dawn&quot;). For &quot;Shadow Dragon&quot;, the character artwork was remade by &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; artist Masamune Shirow. The in-game portraits were instead designed by longtime contributor Daisuke Izuka, who returned as character designer for the remake of &quot;Mystery of the Emblem&quot;. For &quot;Awakening&quot;, art director Toshiyuki Kusakihara worked with character designer Yūsuke Kozaki, who was brought in to give a new look to the series. Kozaki later returned as character designer for &quot;Fates&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot;. For &quot;Echoes: Shadows of Valentia&quot;, illustrator Hidari was hired to revise classic &quot;Gaiden&quot; designs in addition to creating new ones. To depict a &quot;glamorous, aristocratic society&quot; in &quot;Three Houses&quot;, Intelligent Systems contracted character designer Chinatsu Kurahana, best known for her work on &quot;otome&quot; games such as &quot;Uta no Prince-sama&quot;, while freelance artist Kazuma Koda provided the concept art. Kurahana returned to design protagonist Shez, Arval, and the house leaders in its spin-off, &quot;Warriors: Three Hopes&quot;, with Kusakihara filling in for the rest of the cast.

== Games ==
There are currently seventeen games in the core &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series, of which fourteen have been original games and three have been remakes.

=== Main series ===
The first entry in the series, &quot;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot;, was released in 1990 for the Japanese Famicom. A second game for the Famicom, &quot;Fire Emblem Gaiden&quot;, was released in 1992. It is known for having unusual mechanics compared to the rest of the series, such as dungeon exploration. It takes place in a similar timeframe as &quot;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot;, but on a different continent. In 1994, &quot;Mystery of the Emblem&quot; was released for the Super Famicom, containing both a remake of &quot;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot; and a sequel of the first game. Two more games were released for the Super Famicom in 1996 and 1999 respectively: &quot;Genealogy of the Holy War&quot; and &quot;Thracia 776&quot;.

The next entry released was &quot;The Binding Blade&quot; in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance. A prequel to &quot;The Binding Blade&quot;, &quot;The Blazing Blade&quot;, was released for the Game Boy Advance the following year. It was released overseas under the title &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; in 2003 in North America and 2004 in Europe, becoming the first official release of the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series in these regions. This is due in part to the inclusion of Marth and Roy in Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Gamecube in 2001, and the earlier release (and success) of Advance Wars in the West, prompting Intelligent Systems and Nintendo to finally release Fire Emblem in the West. The final entry for the Game Boy Advance, &quot;The Sacred Stones&quot;, was released in 2004 in Japan, and in 2005 in North America and Europe.

The ninth installment in the series, &quot;Path of Radiance&quot;, was released worldwide on the GameCube in 2005. It was the first &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; game to feature 3D graphics, voice acting, and full-motion animated cutscenes. A direct sequel to &quot;Path of Radiance&quot;, &quot;Radiant Dawn&quot; was released for the Wii in 2007 in Japan and North America, and 2008 in Europe.

In 2008, the series returned to handheld systems with two releases for the Nintendo DS. &quot;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon&quot;, an expanded remake of the first game, was released in 2008 in Japan and Europe, and 2009 in North America. &quot;Shadow Dragon&quot; makes use of unique DS features unavailable to the Famicom and introduced new characters, added additional story elements, revamped mechanics, and modernized graphics. A Japanese-only entry, &quot;New Mystery of the Emblem&quot;, was released in 2010 for the DS as an expanded remake of &quot;Mystery of the Emblem&quot;.

The series moved to the Nintendo 3DS with &quot;Fire Emblem Awakening&quot;, the thirteenth game in the series, released in 2012 in Japan and 2013 in North America and Europe. &quot;Awakening&quot; was a major critical and commercial success, and is credited for revitalizing the franchise. The second entry for the Nintendo 3DS, &quot;Fates&quot;, was released in June 2015 in Japan, February 2016 in North America, and in May 2016 for Europe and Australia. &quot;Fates&quot; comes in three versions: two physical versions titled &quot;Birthright&quot; and &quot;Conquest&quot;, and a third route titled &quot;Revelation&quot; released as downloadable content. &quot;Fates&quot; was later re-released as a special version with all three versions included. A third entry, &quot;Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia&quot;, was released on the Nintendo 3DS in April 2017 in Japan and in North America and Europe the following month. &quot;Echoes&quot; is an enhanced remake of &quot;Gaiden&quot;, maintaining many of the unique features of &quot;Gaiden&quot; while revamping the graphics and script, and adding several ease-of-play improvements.

A &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; game was announced for the Nintendo Switch during a Fire Emblem focused Nintendo Direct in January 2017. The game was officially revealed as &quot;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&quot; during the Nintendo Direct presentation at E3 2018, and was released in July 2019. &quot;Fire Emblem Engage&quot;, a second entry for Nintendo Switch, was announced during a September 2022 Nintendo Direct and released in January 2023.

=== Spin-offs and cameos ===
In 1997, an episodic prequel to &quot;Mystery of the Emblem&quot; titled &quot;BS Fire Emblem: Archanea Senki-hen&quot; was released through Satellaview. The events of &quot;Archanea Senki&quot; were included in the remake of &quot;Mystery of the Emblem&quot;. &quot;BS Fire Emblem&quot; is considered an official part of the series by some developers, but not generally by fans. A crossover with the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; series, &quot;Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE&quot;, was released in December 2015 in Japan and worldwide in June 2016 for the Wii U. &quot;Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE&quot; was developed by Atlus rather than Intelligent Systems and combines gameplay, narrative, and aesthetic elements from both the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; series. On January 17, 2020, an enhanced version titled &quot;Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore&quot; was released on Nintendo Switch. &quot;Fire Emblem Heroes&quot; is a spin-off gacha game for Android and iOS, and was released in February 2017 for mobile devices. &quot;Heroes&quot; is a crossover of characters from across the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series, rather than with another series, and also introduced original characters not seen in any other &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; game. A crossover with the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; series, &quot;Fire Emblem Warriors&quot;, was released for the New Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Switch in 2017. It was developed by Omega Force and Team Ninja. A second &quot;Warriors&quot; game, based on &quot;Three Houses,&quot; and titled &quot;Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes&quot; was announced in a Nintendo Direct on February 9, 2022 and released on June 24, 2022.

Characters from the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series have appeared in a number of other games as cameos or as part of crossovers. This includes multiple entries in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, beginning with protagonists Marth and Roy in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;. Characters from the series also appeared in Intelligent Systems&#x27; strategy game &quot;Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.&quot; as optional characters unlocked via amiibo.

=== Cancelled games ===
A &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; game was initially in development for the Nintendo 64 and its peripheral 64DD. Originally codenamed &quot;Fire Emblem 64&quot;, it was first revealed by Shigeru Miyamoto in 1997. Ultimately, due to poor sales for the 64DD and internal structural changes at Intelligent Systems, &quot;Fire Emblem 64&quot; was cancelled in 2000 and development shifted to what would become &quot;Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade&quot;. Work done for &quot;Fire Emblem 64&quot; was incorporated into &quot;The Binding Blade&quot;.

An additional RTS-based game for the Wii was planned and would have been released after &quot;Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn&quot;, but after trial and error and an unfocused development schedule, the project was cancelled. Intelligent Systems never planned a &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; game for the Wii U. Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami said such a game would need to sell 700,000 copies to be profitable. A rumored &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; remake for the Nintendo 3DS was being developed by AlphaDream, but was cancelled following the company&#x27;s bankruptcy surfaced in late 2019. According to the reports, it was one of the many video games that had been in development, but were ultimately scrapped for the platform, with many speculating those projects could be moved to the Nintendo Switch.

== Reception ==
Sales in Japan were the highest with &quot;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&quot; but progressively declined with future games, which sold 329,087; 324,699; 776,338; 498,216 and 106,108 copies respectively. As of 2002, total sales had reached over two million copies. &quot;Awakening&quot; topped the total sales of both &quot;Radiant Dawn&quot; and the &quot;Mystery of the Emblem&quot; remake in its first week. It went on to sell 2.35 million copies worldwide and become the best-selling &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; game in Western territories at the time.

In 2007, a Japanese public poll named &quot;Mystery of the Emblem&quot; as one of the country&#x27;s All Time Top 100 video games. Speaking to &quot;USGamer&quot;, &quot;Massive Chalice&quot; creator Brad Muir commented on how &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; had influenced the game, referring to it as &quot;[a] venerable strategy series&quot;, making positive reference to its gameplay and character relationships. In her review of &quot;Awakening&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Audrey Drake said that &quot;Far too few people have played the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series&quot;, calling it &quot;[a] darling of the hardcore strategy RPG crowd - and one of the shining gems of the genre&quot;.

Several journalistic sites have cited its low notoriety in the west as an effect of Nintendo&#x27;s sporadic localization efforts, along with its place in a niche game genre. At the same time, they have praised the series&#x27; gameplay, regularly noting its high difficulty and relationship mechanics. The series has been cited as an inspiration for later tactical role-playing games, with &quot;Gamasutra&quot; naming &quot;Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and the &quot;Disgaea&quot; series as being influenced by its design. In 2014, &quot;Destructoid&quot; writer Chris Carter praised the series&#x27; mechanics, and at the same time chose &quot;Mystery of the Emblem&quot;, &quot;Path of Radiance&quot;, and &quot;Awakening&quot; in his list of the five best games in the series. &quot;Awakening&quot; is generally cited as having brought the series more publicity and player attention outside of Japan.

== Legacy ==

=== &quot;Tear Ring Saga&quot; lawsuit ===
After Kaga left Intelligent Systems, he founded a studio called Tirnanog and began development on a game titled &quot;Emblem Saga&quot;, a strategy role-playing game for the PlayStation. The game bore multiple similarities to the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series, and Nintendo filed a lawsuit against Tirnanog for copyright infringement. The first suit failed, and the court ruled in Tirnanog&#x27;s favor. Nintendo filed a second lawsuit, and this time was awarded a cash settlement of ¥76 million. Nevertheless, Tirnanog and publisher Enterbrain were still allowed to publish the entry, though they changed its name to &quot;Tear Ring Saga&quot;, and eventually developed a sequel. Nintendo attempted taking a third lawsuit to the Japanese Supreme Court in 2005, but the second ruling was upheld.

===In other media===
A short, two episode original video animation series based on &quot;Mystery of the Emblem&quot; released in 1996. These anime episodes were released in North America in 1998, five years before &quot;The Blazing Blade&quot; was localized, making them the first official &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; media to be released in the region. Nintendo produced Amiibo figures of several &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; characters; they are compatible with &quot;Fates&quot;, &quot;Echoes: Shadows of Valentia&quot;, &quot;Three Houses&quot;, &quot;Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.,&quot; &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.&quot; Manga based on the games have also been produced, including &quot;The Binding Blade&quot;, &quot;Awakening&quot;, and &quot;Engage&quot;. Two trading card games have been made with the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; franchise: &quot;Fire Emblem: Trading Card Game&quot;, which was released from 2001–2006, and &quot;Fire Emblem 0 (Cipher)&quot;, which was released in 2015 and was discontinued in late 2020 with the twenty second expansion pack being the last one.

<doc id="302850" wikidata="Q1677725" url="?curid=302850" title="The Charlatans (American band)">
<text>The Charlatans were an American folk rock and psychedelic rock band that played a role in the development of the San Francisco Haight-Ashbury music scene during the 1960s. They are often cited by critics as being the first group to play in the style that became known as the San Francisco Sound.

Exhibiting more pronounced jug band, country and blues influences than many bands from the same scene, the Charlatans&#x27; rebellious attitude and distinctive late 19th-century fashions exerted a strong influence on the Summer of Love in San Francisco. The band&#x27;s recorded output was small. Following difficulties with various record labels, their only album, &quot;The Charlatans&quot;, was recorded and released by a reconstituted lineup (with only two members of the original group) in 1969.

Original drummer Dan Hicks went on to form Dan Hicks &amp; His Hot Licks, a more commercially successful ensemble that amalgamated elements of country, folk and jazz in a predominantly acoustic setting. Guitarist Mike Wilhelm later joined the Flamin&#x27; Groovies.

==Early years: 1964–1965==
Formed in mid-1964 by amateur avant-garde musician George Hunter and music major Richard Olsen, the earliest lineup of the Charlatans featured Hunter on autoharp and vocals, and Olsen on bass and vocals, along with Mike Wilhelm (lead guitar, vocals), Mike Ferguson (piano/keyboards, vocals), and Sam Linde (drums). Linde&#x27;s drumming was felt to be substandard by the rest of the band and he was soon replaced by Dan Hicks, who also contributed vocals to the group.

The Charlatans were known for clothing themselves in late 19th-century attire, as if they were Victorian dandies or Wild West gunslingers. This unconventional choice of clothing was influential on the emerging hippie counter-culture, with many young San Franciscans dressing in similarly late Victorian and early Edwardian era clothing.

In June 1965, the Charlatans began a six-week residency at the Red Dog Saloon in Virginia City, Nevada, just across the border from Northern California. During this stint at the Red Dog, band members Ferguson and Hunter designed and produced a rock concert poster in advance of the residency to promote the band&#x27;s performances. This poster, known as &quot;The Seed&quot;, is widely regarded by critics as the first psychedelic concert poster. By the end of the decade, psychedelic concert-poster artwork by artists such as Wes Wilson, Rick Griffin, Stanley Mouse, Carol Alexander, Alton Kelley, and Victor Moscoso had become a mainstay of San Francisco&#x27;s music scene.

Another reason that the Charlatans&#x27; stay at the Red Dog is regarded by critics and historians as significant is that, immediately before their first performance at the club, the band members took LSD. As a result, the Charlatans are sometimes called the first acid rock band, although their sound is not representative of the feedback-drenched, improvisational music that would later come to define the sub-genre.

The Charlatans returned to San Francisco at the end of summer 1965 and, in September, were given the chance to audition for Autumn Records, a label headed by local DJ, Tom &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Donahue. Autumn didn&#x27;t sign the band, partly due to conflicts between the group and Donahue over suitable material and partly due to lack of money; the label was on the verge of bankruptcy and was sold to Warner Bros. Records early the following year.

==Later years: 1966–1969==
The failed Autumn Records audition proved to be only a minor setback, with the Charlatans signing with Kama Sutra Records in early 1966. As home to the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, one of the earliest folk rock bands to find international success, the group thought the label would be the ideal home for their music. However, after the band had recorded a number of songs and chosen to issue &quot;Codine&quot; as their debut single, the record company vetoed the release, citing the song&#x27;s drug connotations. In fact, the tune—penned by folk artist Buffy Sainte-Marie—spoke of the dangers of drugs, rather than promoting their use, but Kama Sutra was adamant and refused to release the song.

Instead, two other songs from the Kama Sutra sessions, &quot;The Shadow Knows&quot; and &quot;32-20&quot;, were released by Kapp Records in 1966 as the band&#x27;s first single, with some copies being housed in a rare promotional-only picture sleeve. Kapp Records failed to adequately promote the release and, as a result, the single was commercially unsuccessful. The remaining songs recorded during the Kama Sutra sessions for the Charlatans&#x27; debut album remained unreleased until they were officially issued for the first time by Big Beat Records in 1996, on &quot;The Amazing Charlatans&quot; album.

Ferguson was fired from the Charlatans in 1967 and replaced by Patrick Gogerty. Additionally, Terry Wilson was brought in to take over as drummer after Dan Hicks switched to rhythm guitar, enabling him to sing his own compositions as a front man for the group. Hicks eventually left the group in 1968 to form his own band, Dan Hicks &amp; His Hot Licks, and Gogerty was subsequently fired from the band.

Tensions between Hunter and the rest of the group escalated throughout 1968, until Wilhelm, Olsen and Wilson decided to disband the group, reforming soon afterward, without inviting Hunter back into the band. The Charlatans recruited new member Darrell DeVore (piano/keyboards, vocals) and soon secured a recording contract with Philips Records. The band released one album with Philips in 1969, titled simply &quot;The Charlatans&quot;. Author and critic Richie Unterberger has speculated that the album&#x27;s commercial failure was due to the personnel changes having diluted some of the energy of the original line-up and their sound being somewhat outdated by 1969.

==Breakup and reunions==
Following the release of &quot;The Charlatans&quot;, Wilson was forced to leave the band in order to begin serving a prison sentence for marijuana possession. The original quintet of Hunter, Olsen, Wilhelm, Ferguson and Hicks reunited briefly during the summer of 1969, but by the end of the year, the Charlatans had broken up once more.

After the breakup, Wilhelm went on to front the band Loose Gravel from 1969 until 1976, before becoming a member of the Flamin&#x27; Groovies during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Olsen became a producer and a manager at Pacific High Studios and some time later formed the swing group Richard Olsen &amp; His Big Band. Hunter founded the Globe Propaganda design company and his artwork appeared on many LP covers, including &quot;Happy Trails&quot; (Quicksilver Messenger Service), &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (Canned Heat), and &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&quot; (It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day). Ferguson joined Lynne Hughes, a barmaid from the Red Dog Saloon, in the band Tongue and Groove.

In 1996, a documentary was released entitled &quot;The Life and Times of the Red Dog Saloon&quot; (also known as &quot;Rockin&#x27; at the Red Dog: The Dawn of Psychedelic Rock&quot;), in which the surviving members of the Charlatans (Ferguson died in 1979 from complications from diabetes) were interviewed about their days at the Red Dog. The following year, the Charlatans rehearsed for a series of secret gigs at the legendary Sweetwater club in Mill Valley, followed by a series of reunion performances at The Fillmore. The latter-day line-up of the band, composed of Hunter, Hicks, Wilhelm, and Olsen, were not heard from again until 2005, when they performed an abbreviated set at a memorial concert for Family Dog founder Chet Helms in Golden Gate Park. The foursome returned to Golden Gate Park on September 2, 2007 performing at the Summer of Love 40th Anniversary concert (the show also featured a set from Dan Hicks &amp; His Hot Licks).

On June 20 and 21, 2015, the foursome reunited for the final time, presenting their first full sets since 1997 for their 50th anniversary concerts. For this celebration, the band returned to the Red Dog Saloon in Virginia City.

Dan Hicks died from throat and liver cancer at his home in Mill Valley, California on February 6, 2016. Mike Wilhelm died on May 14, 2019.

Despite their lackluster and commercially unsuccessful recording career, the Charlatans hold the distinction of being the first of the underground San Francisco bands of the 1960s.

<text>Operation Kedem was an action planned and carried out by Irgun and Lehi forces in July 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli war. Its purpose was to capture East Jerusalem, including the Old City. After the first cease-fire of the Arab–Israeli War, which lasted for four weeks, the balance in power in Jerusalem had shifted dramatically. The Jews were now much stronger than the Arabs in the Jerusalem sector. Irgun and Lehi attempts to break through the wall into the Old City failed.

== Operation ==
The operation was to be carried out by Irgun and Lehi forces on July 8 with help from the Haganah. But it was delayed by David Shaltiel. He told them to first capture the Arab village of Malha. On July 14, 1948, after a fierce battle in the early hours of the morning, the Irgun occupied the village. Several hours later, the Arabs launched a counterattack. Reinforcements arrived and the village was retaken by the Arabs. The Irgun lost 17 men in the battle for Malha, and many were wounded.

The Irgun force commanded by Yehuda Lapidot (Nimrod) was to break through at the New Gate, Lehi to break through the wall stretching from the New Gate and Jaffa Gate, and the Beit Horon Battalion to strike from Mount Zion.

The battle was planned to begin on Shabbat, 20:00 Friday July 16, a day before the second cease-fire of the Arab–Israeli War. The plan went wrong from the beginning and was postponed first to 23:00 and then to midnight. Not until 02:30 did the battle actually begin. The Irgunists managed to break through at the New Gate, but the other forces failed in their missions. At 05:45, Shaltiel ordered a retreat and cessation of hostilities.

<text>The Charlatans (often referred to as The Charlatans UK in the United States) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham, West Midlands in 1988. As of 2000, the band’s line-up consists of lead vocalist Tim Burgess, guitarist Mark Collins, bassist Martin Blunt, and keyboardist Tony Rogers.

All of the band&#x27;s thirteen studio albums have charted in the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart, with three reaching number one. They have also achieved 22 top 40 singles and four top 10 entries in the UK Singles Chart, including the hits &quot;The Only One I Know&quot; and &quot;One to Another&quot;.

== History ==
=== Formation (1988–1989) ===
The band were formed in the West Midlands by bassist Martin Blunt, who recruited fellow West Midlanders Rob Collins (keyboards), Jon Brookes (drums), Jon Day (Jonathan Baker) (guitar) and singer-guitarist Baz Ketley. Ketley left the band and was replaced by singer Tim Burgess, who had previously supported the Charlatans with his band, the Electric Crayons.

Although the Charlatans would later become popularly associated with the Madchester scene, the band’s early demos recorded in 1988 in Birmingham and Dudley already showcased the sound that would later define their music, characterised by Collins&#x27;s Hammond organ, underpinned by the driving rhythm section of Blunt’s powerful bass and Brookes&#x27;s drumming. With their sound – a fusion of 1960s soul, R&amp;B and garage rock – inherited from Blunt&#x27;s earlier 1982 band Makin&#x27; Time, the band saw themselves as part of the West Midlands tradition of hard-edged soul and R&amp;B, which included Birmingham bands The Spencer Davis Group and early Dexys Midnight Runners. Blunt has characterised the band’s early influences as including the Stranglers, Stax Records, Joy Division and the Doors, but has also credited the band&#x27;s formation during the explosive growth of the acid house scene as contributing to their sound, explaining that they &quot;suddenly sounded like the Spencer Davis Group on E&quot;.

Although the name The Charlatans was already in use when the original members of the band were still based in the West Midlands, many sources state that they formed in Northwich, Cheshire. This is because the band relocated to the hometown of their manager Steve Harrison and new lead singer Tim Burgess (who was born in Salford, but lived in Northwich from an early age) before the 1990 release of The Charlatans&#x27; debut single &quot;Indian Rope&quot; (released on Dead Dead Good Records, the label owned by Harrison, who also owned the Omega Records retail chain and management company, after the band were unable to secure a major record contract). Thus, based on the definition of hometown used by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, the band was formed in Northwich, and consequently, Northwich is recorded as their hometown in publications such as &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;. One of the band&#x27;s earliest known live performances was supporting The Stone Roses at the London School of Economics on 2 December 1988.

=== Early years (1990–1993) ===
The debut single &quot;Indian Rope&quot; proved to be an indie hit, and the group soon secured a major label in Beggars Banquet offshoot Situation Two, in time for the release of &quot;The Only One I Know&quot;, which reached the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart. A further single, &quot;Then&quot;, and their debut album &quot;Some Friendly&quot; were released later that year. Around this time, The Charlatans were forced to add &quot;UK&quot; to their name for an American tour due to competing claims by an American rock band also known as The Charlatans.

Day left the band after the 1991 release of the &quot;Over Rising&quot; single and was replaced by Mark Collins (unrelated to Rob Collins). The band enlisted producer Flood for their second album, &quot;Between 10th and 11th&quot; (named after the address of the New York Marquee, the venue of the group&#x27;s first US concert). Released in early 1992, the album failed to reach the Top 20 of the UK Albums Chart, but the Top 20 success of lead single &quot;Weirdo&quot; and a double weekend of gigs (&#x27;Daytripper&#x27;) in Blackpool and Brighton, alongside Ride, helped maintain their visibility in the public eye.

The band suffered a major setback later that year when Rob Collins was charged with armed robbery after a friend had robbed an off licence while Collins waited in the car outside. Collins claimed to have had no prior knowledge of the robbery until he heard a gunshot from inside the shop and saw his friend exit. However, he later admitted that he should not have picked up his friend after realising what he had done. In court, Collins pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of &quot;assisting an offender after an offence&quot; and served four months in prison.

=== Mid-nineties fame (1994–1997) ===
Their third album, &quot;Up To Our Hips&quot; (1994), reached number 8 on the UK Albums Chart.

In 1995, the release of the band&#x27;s self-titled fourth album marked their return to prominence in the UK, topping the UK albums chart and spawning the Top 20 single &quot;Just When You&#x27;re Thinkin&#x27; Things Over&quot;.

Keyboard player Rob Collins was tragically killed in a traffic accident on 22 July 1996, during the recording of the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot;. The Charlatans decided to continue, enlisting Primal Scream and former Felt keyboardist Martin Duffy until a permanent replacement for Collins could be found, particularly for their support slot at Oasis&#x27; Knebworth concerts, which were just weeks away, scheduled for 10 and 11 August. &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot; was released in 1997, featuring contributions from both Rob Collins and Duffy. The group achieved their biggest UK hits to date with the singles &quot;One to Another&quot;, &quot;North Country Boy&quot; and &quot;How High&quot;.

=== Line-up and label changes (1997–2004) ===
After the release of the career-spanning compilation &quot;Melting Pot&quot;, the band&#x27;s contract with Beggars Banquet expired, and they signed to Universal Records. Relations with the Beggars label remained strong, however, and the band helped compile the B-sides collection &quot;Songs From The Other Side&quot; and the DVD &quot;Just Lookin&#x27; 1990–1997&quot;, which showcased all their promotional videos and a selection of live recordings from that era.

&quot;Us and Us Only&quot; marked the start of a new era for The Charlatans. Their first release for Universal featured new keyboard player Tony Rogers, who made his Charlatans album debut, having previously toured in support of &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot; and contributed to the B-sides &quot;Keep It to Yourself&quot; and &quot;Clean Up Kid&quot; from the &quot;How High&quot; single. The band embraced a slightly country sound, heavily influenced by Burgess&#x27;s love of Bob Dylan.

The soul-influenced &quot;Wonderland&quot; followed in 2001; that year, the band performed at V Festival in London.

The album &quot;Up at the Lake&quot; was released in 2004.

=== The Sanctuary years (2005–2007) ===
The band released their ninth full-length album on 10 April 2006, their first for new label Sanctuary Records. Titled &quot;Simpatico&quot;, the reggae- and dub-tinged album was produced by Jim Lowe and included the fan favourite &quot;NYC (There&#x27;s No Need to Stop)&quot; and first single &quot;Blackened Blue Eyes&quot;. The single charted at number 28, while the album reached the top 10 in its debut week before dropping off the charts shortly afterward.

Their follow-up to &quot;Simpatico&quot; was the career-spanning singles compilation entitled &quot;&quot;, released on CD and DVD on 13 November 2006. It was preceded by the single &quot;You&#x27;re So Pretty We&#x27;re So Pretty&quot;, remixed by Youth from its original version on &quot;Wonderland&quot; (2001).

In mid-2007, the band played a number of high-profile gigs, supporting The Who and The Rolling Stones at venues including Wembley Stadium and Twickenham Stadium in London, as well as performing at the Bingley Music Live event, Nass Festival 2007, and at Delamere Forest in Cheshire. A recording of &quot;Live at Delamere Forest&quot; was released as a five-part download for a limited time via their official website.

=== Cooking Vinyl, nostalgic performances and Brookes&#x27;s illness (2008–2012) ===
The band contributed the song &quot;Blank Heart, Blank Mind&quot; to a Love Music Hate Racism compilation CD, which was included free with the October 2007 issue of &quot;NME&quot;. Later that month, the new single &quot;You Cross My Path&quot; was released as a free download, exclusively through the XFM website. A second single, &quot;Oh! Vanity&quot;, was released in March 2008, as The Charlatans teamed up with XFM once again, becoming the first UK band to release an album (their tenth studio album, &quot;You Cross My Path&quot;) as a free download via a radio station. The album also received a physical CD/LP release on the Cooking Vinyl label on 19 May 2008, which coincided with a full UK tour.

Their eleventh studio album, &quot;Who We Touch&quot;, was released on 6 September 2010 on Cooking Vinyl Records and included the single &quot;Love Is Ending&quot;. The album charted at No. 21 on the UK Albums Chart. 2010 also marked the twentieth anniversary of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Some Friendly&quot;, which they performed live at the Primavera Sound Festival 2010.

On 15 September 2010, drummer Jon Brookes collapsed during a performance in Philadelphia. The remaining US tour dates were postponed, as Brookes was diagnosed with a brain tumour and was flown back to the UK for an operation and a course of radiation and chemotherapy treatment. The Verve&#x27;s Peter Salisbury acted as a stand-in drummer for the remainder of The Charlatans&#x27; UK dates. Brookes returned to the stage for the band&#x27;s Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve gigs in 2010.

On 28 March 2011, Universal Music re-released a deluxe edition of the band&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Us and Us Only&quot;, featuring a collection of bonus tracks, including B-sides, live recordings, radio sessions, and rare remixes. In March and April 2011, Tim Burgess and Mark Collins played an acoustic tour of the UK, to coincide with which they released an EP, &quot;Warm Sounds&quot;, featuring six stripped-down and reworked versions of Charlatans tracks, including &quot;North Country Boy&quot;, &quot;The Only One I Know&quot; and &quot;Smash The System&quot;. In December 2011, the band announced they would be performing &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot; in its entirety at London&#x27;s HMV Hammersmith Apollo, O2 Apollo Manchester and Glasgow&#x27;s Barrowland Ballroom in June 2012.

=== Death of Jon Brookes, &quot;Modern Nature&quot;, &quot;Different Days&quot; and &quot;A Head Full of Ideas&quot; (2013–present) === 
The band returned to their Big Mushroom studio to begin working on demos for a new album in 2013. In May, the &quot;Mountain Picnic Blues&quot; DVD was released, a documentary about their &quot;Tellin&#x27; Stories&quot; album from its creation in 1997 to the 15th anniversary of the album.

On 13 August 2013, the band&#x27;s 44-year-old drummer Jon Brookes died from a brain tumour, having undergone several operations and treatments for the condition since his initial diagnosis in 2010. The band paid tribute to him in a special event, with Pete Salisbury playing in his place and bands such as Beady Eye, The Vaccines and Manic Street Preachers also joining the bill. Proceeds from the night went to The Brain Tumour Charity, of which The Charlatans are now patrons; the charity set up The Jon Brookes Fund as a lasting tribute to the drummer.

Tim Burgess confirmed that Brookes&#x27;s recordings would appear on the band&#x27;s next album, originally slated for release sometime in 2014.

The Charlatans announced details of their twelfth studio album, &quot;Modern Nature&quot;, to be released on 26 January 2015 on their new label BMG Rights Management. Featuring eleven new tracks (including the recent limited edition 7&quot; &quot;Talking in Tones&quot;), &quot;Modern Nature&quot; was produced by The Charlatans and Jim Spencer and mixed by Craig Silvey. The album features contributions from the band&#x27;s temporary drummers Peter Salisbury (of The Verve), Stephen Morris (of New Order) and Gabriel Gurnsey (of Factory Floor), as well as producer Dave Tolan, backing singers Melanie Marshall and Sandra Marvin, strings by Sean O&#x27;Hagan and brass courtesy of Jim Paterson from Dexys Midnight Runners.

The group&#x27;s thirteenth album, &quot;Different Days&quot;, was released on 26 May 2017.

In July 2021, the group announced the release of &quot;A Head Full of Ideas: The Best of Charlatans&quot;, which was released on 15 October 2021.

On 1 June 2022, the group supported Liam Gallagher at his concert at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.

On 16 July 2022, the group supported Gerry Cinnamon at his concert at Hampden Park in Glasgow.

<doc id="302862" wikidata="Q852448" url="?curid=302862" title="President of Nicaragua">
<text>The co-presidents of Nicaragua (), officially known as the Presidency of the Republic of Nicaragua (), are the heads of state and government of Nicaragua.

The office was created in the Constitution of 1854. From 1825 until the Constitution of 1839, the head of state of Nicaragua was styled simply as Head of State (&quot;Jefe de Estado&quot;), and from 1839 to 1854 as Supreme Director (&quot;Supremo Director&quot;).

In 2025, the Constitution of Nicaragua was amended to provide for the powers of the presidency to be exercised by two co-presidents rather than a single officeholder. A male and female co-president are elected by universal suffrage to a six-year term. When the amendment was passed, the incumbent president Daniel Ortega and his wife and vice-president Rosario Murillo were declared to be the inaugural co-presidents. Ortega had previously served as president since 2007.

==Constitutional basis==
In 2009, the Supreme Court of Nicaragua ruled that the constitutional ban on immediate reelection was unenforceable. In 2014, the National Assembly amended the constitution to allow the President to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms.

In 2025, the assembly extended the presidential term to six years and declared incumbent president Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, co-presidents. The revised constitution provides for the powers of the presidency to be exercised by a male and female co-president elected by universal suffrage. Candidates for election must have resided in Nicaragua for at least six years prior to the election, must hold only Nicaraguan nationality, and must not have been declared &quot;traitors to the homeland&quot; (Spanish: &quot;traidores a la patria&quot;). The qualifications effectively disqualified leading opposition candidates from standing for election, as they had been exiled and stripped of their citizenship in February 2023.

<text>Correcting a Mistake: Jews and Arabs in Palestine/Israel, 1936–1956 (, &quot;Tikun Ta&#x27;ut: yehudim v&#x27;araviim b&#x27;eretz yisrael 1936–1956&quot;) is a book by Israeli historian Benny Morris.

&quot;Tikun Ta&#x27;ut&quot; is a collection of articles published in 2000 in Hebrew by Am Oved. One of the articles focuses on new evidence regarding Operation Hiram in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War: documents released by the IDF Archives revealed that on 31 October 1948, Major General Moshe Carmel issued a radio order during the operation addressing all division and district commanders under his command, in which he said: &quot;Do all in your power to clear quickly and immediately from the areas conquered all hostile elements in accordance with the orders issued. The inhabitants should be assisted to leave the conquered areas.&quot;

According to Morris, his mistake was to believe what Carmel and others told him—that no deportation order was issued during Operation Hiram. Because of the cable mentioned above, he found himself obliged to correct his book &quot;The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947–1948&quot; with this article.

<doc id="302865" wikidata="Q319439" url="?curid=302865" title="Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona">
<text>Ramon Berenguer IV (; c. 1114 – 6 August 1162, Anglicized Raymond Berengar IV), sometimes called the Saint, was the count of Barcelona and the consort of Aragon who brought about the union of the County of Barcelona with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the Crown of Aragon.

==Early reign==
Ramon Berenguer was born 1114, the son of Count Ramon Berenguer III of Barcelona and Countess Douce I of Provence. He inherited the county of Barcelona from his father Ramon Berenguer III on 19 August 1131. On 11 August 1137, at the age of about 24, he was betrothed to the infant Petronilla of Aragon, aged one at the time. Petronilla&#x27;s father, King Ramiro II of Aragon, who sought Barcelona&#x27;s aid against King Alfonso VII of Leon, withdrew from public life on 13 November 1137, leaving his kingdom to Petronilla and Ramon Berenguer.

In effect becoming ruler of Aragon, although Ramon Berenguer was never king himself in acknowledgment of his own status as a consort, instead commonly using the titles &quot;Count of the Barcelonans and Prince of the Aragonians&quot; (&quot;Comes Barcinonensis et Princeps Aragonensis&quot;), and occasionally those of &quot;Marquis of Lleida and Tortosa&quot; (after conquering these cities).

The treaty between Ramon Berenguer and his father-in-law, Ramiro II, stipulated that their descendants would rule jointly over both realms, and that even if Petronilla died before the marriage could be consummated, Ramon Berenguer&#x27;s heirs would still inherit the Kingdom of Aragon. Both realms would preserve their laws, institutions and autonomy, remaining legally distinct but federated in a dynastic union under one ruling house. Historians consider this arrangement the political masterstroke of the Hispanic Middle Ages. Both realms gained greater strength and security and Aragon got its much needed outlet to the sea. On the other hand, formation of a new political entity in the north-east at the time when Portugal seceded from León in the west gave more balance to the Christian kingdoms of the peninsula. Ramon Berenguer successfully pulled Aragon out of its pledged submission to Castile, aided no doubt by his sister Berengaria, wife of Alfonso VII, who was well known in her time for her beauty and charm.

==Crusades and wars==
In the middle years of his rule, Ramon Berenguer turned his attention to campaigns against the Moors. In October 1147, as part of the Second Crusade, he helped Castile to conquer Almería. He then invaded the lands of the Almoravid taifa kingdoms of Valencia and Murcia. In December 1148, he captured Tortosa after a six-month siege with the help of Southern French, Anglo-Norman and Genoese crusaders. The next year, Fraga, Lleida and Mequinenza in the confluence of the Segre and Ebro rivers fell to his army after a seven-month siege.

Ramon Berenguer also campaigned in Provence, helping his brother Berenguer Ramon and his infant nephew Ramon Berenguer II against the counts of Toulouse. During the minority of Ramon Berenguer II, the count of Barcelona also acted as the regent of Provence (between 1144 and 1157). In 1151, Ramon signed the Treaty of Tudilén with Alfonso VII of León and Castile. The treaty defined the zones of conquest in Andalusia as an attempt to prevent the two rulers from coming into conflict. Also in 1151, Ramon Berenguer founded and endowed the royal monastery of Poblet. In 1154, he accepted the regency of Gaston V of Béarn in return for the Bearnese nobles rendering him homage at Canfranc, thus uniting that small principality with the growing Aragonese state.

==Marriage and children==
Ramon and Petronilla had:
*Infante Peter
*Alfonso II of Aragon
*Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Provence
*Dulce, Queen of Portugal
*Sancho, Count of Provence

==Death==
Ramon Berenguer IV died on 6 August 1162 in Borgo San Dalmazzo, Piedmont, Italy. He was succeeded by Petronilla and then by his eldest surviving son, Ramon Berenguer, who also inherited the Kingdom of Aragon upon Petronilla&#x27;s abdication in 1164. He changed his name to Alfonso as a nod to his Aragonese lineage, and became Alfonso II of Aragon. Ramon Berenguer IV&#x27;s younger son Pere (Peter) inherited the county of Cerdanya and lands north of the Pyrenees, and changed his name to Ramon Berenguer.

==Appearance and character==
The &quot;Chronicle of San Juan de la Peña&quot; said he was, &quot;[a] man of particularly great nobility, prudence, and probity, of lively temperament, high counsel, great bravery, and steady intellect, who displayed great temperance in all his actions. He was handsome in appearance, with a large body and very well-proportioned limbs.&quot;

<doc id="302869" wikidata="Q255081" url="?curid=302869" title="Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy">
<text>Throughout the fifth century, Hellenistic-Eastern political systems, philosophies, and theocratic Christian concepts had gained power in the Greek-speaking Eastern Mediterranean due to the intervention of important religious figures there such as Eusebius of Caesarea () and Origen of Alexandria () who had been key to developing the constant Christianized worldview of late antiquity.

By the 6th century, such ideas had already influenced the definitive power of the monarch as the representative of God on earth and of his kingdom as an imitation of God&#x27;s holy realm. The Byzantine Empire was a multi-ethnic monarchic theocracy adopting, following, and applying the Orthodox-Hellenistic political systems and philosophies. The monarch was the incarnation of the law&quot;nomos empsychos&quot;and his power was immeasurable and divine in origin insofar as he channeled God&#x27;s divine grace, maintaining what is good. He was the ultimate benefactor, caretaker, and saviour of the people: &quot;Evergétis&quot;, &quot;Philanthrōpía&quot;, and &quot;Sōtēr,&quot; anointed with all power, upholding the divine laws since he ought to emulate Christ first (&quot;christomimetes&quot;) in all of his divine, pious, loving orthodox attributes to all by being his earthly presence.

The people in turn were the monarch&#x27;s &quot;paroikoi&quot; (subjects). He was the sole administrator and lawgiver of the holy &quot;Basileia&quot; and &quot;Oikoumene&quot; (commonwealth), with sole power over the state, the land, and his subjects, which he had achieved through God&#x27;s appointment of him as king. This opened a new stage of reverence in which Hellenistic and Eastern court ceremonies such as proskynesis highlighted the divinity of the ruler and became standardized and often mandatory. In practice, imperial power was exercised as administrationsimplified and centralized through viceroys such as the &quot;Exarchos&quot;, &quot;Douk&quot;, &quot;Katepánō&quot;, &quot;Kephalai&quot; and the &quot;Strategoi&quot; who enjoyed the same omnipotence and the emperor&#x27;s God given divinity in their respective governorships.

Such concentrations of power proved to be both an internal weakness and the cause of various coups and rebellions in which viceroys with provincial armies and, sometimes, entire themes, would often challenge imperial power with claims of their own. In this way emperors such as Nikephoros II Phokas () and Heraclius () achieved royal power for themselves.

There were no codified laws on the imperial succession, and the Roman Republic was never formally abolished. Theoretically, each emperor was formally elected, by both the senate (Synkletos) and the army. In practice, however, the Senate had lost all of its former powers and was mostly reduced to a ceremonial role, filled with relatives or close aristocrats to the Emperor; while the Army practically had a monopoly regarding elections. Emperors usually managed to secure succession for their children through indirect means, such as appointing them as co-emperors, and thus introduced various dynasties. The absence of codified succession laws and procedures, as well as the militarized state of the Empire, led to a number of coups and revolts, leading to several disastrous results, such as the 1071 defeat at Manzikert.

Applying Orthodox-Hellenistic political schemes, the monarch&#x27;s household was the sacred kingdom &quot;Oikonomia&quot;, and he was its Christ-loving owner and manager &quot;Oikonomos&quot;, which meant that no individual or institution through the history of the empire truly owned any land in the face of state supreme ownership. Beneath the emperor, a multitude of officials and court functionariesall directly chosen by the emperor or by one of his representativesoperated the empire&#x27;s administrative bureaucracy. State officials acted not as magistrates or elected public legates, but as representatives, deputies, and viceroys of the monarch in his different domains throughout the empire. In addition to those officials, a number of honorific titles existed, which the emperor awarded to prominent subjects or to friendly foreign rulers.

Over the more than a thousand years of the empire&#x27;s existence, the Imperial administrative system evolved in its adoption of historic titles. At first, the various titles of the empire were the same as those of the late Roman Empire. However, by the era of Heraclius (), a number of the titles had become obsolete. By the time of Alexios I (), a number of the positions were either new or drastically changed. However, from that time on, they remained essentially the same until the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453.

==Background history==
In the early Byzantine period (4th to late 6th century), the administrative structure of the empire was a conglomeration of the late Roman Empire&#x27;s diocese system, set up by Diocletian and Constantine, and of Justinian&#x27;s innovations; in the years 535 and 536 Justinian&#x27;s administrative reforms were formalized. This eliminated the administrative diocese system hierarchy established in previous centuries and with it the strict military and civic divisions within the empire, replacing it with various provincial circumscriptions directly governed by deputies of the emperor, variously called &quot;Stratalates&quot;, &quot;Strategoi&quot; and &quot;Harmost&quot;. These deputies held extraordinary military and administrative powers accompanied by prestigious new titleholders in an attempt to lessen corruption and simplify the emperor&#x27;s direct handling over its domains, foreshadowing similar future administrative reforms initiated and endorsed by contemporary divine Orthodox monarchical philosophy in the Greek-speaking eastern Mediterranean.

Following the transformation of the Byzantine state during the 7th century due to massive territorial loss to the Muslim conquests, this early structuring came to be replaced by the thematic military system whose functions had been simplified and specialized in the rapid creation of provincial armies. Influenced by Orthodox kingship and Hellenistic theocratic philosophies, power was relegated to military leaders, with the various Strategoi, Katepan, Douk, Kephalai or Exarch each acting as viceroys in their respective &quot;thémata&quot; or governorships, all being appointed by the sovereign directly. These governors, being the direct representatives of the monarch himself all through the provinces, enjoyed an omnipotence of their own, accompanied by the divine attributes for being deputies of the emperor himself in their respective districts. Their primary tasks were jointly working with the various provincial subordinates of the capital bureaus for the effective collection of taxes from the different communities &quot;(&quot;Chora&quot;, &quot;Komai&quot;),&quot; from the different land owners estates &quot;(&quot;proasteion&quot;),&quot; and from monasteries &quot;(&quot;episkepsis&quot;)&quot;. Additionally, and more commonly, as the right hand of the emperor in the management of internal and external affairs, they had to provide an efficient management of fast and flexible provincial armies, dispatching them to appease different threats within the borders, or for the management of new successful territorial acquisitions after long-term campaigns, thereby taking key roles as protagonists of any armed offensive headed by the emperor.

A Strategos, or any military governor, was assisted by several deputies, chief among them the &quot;tourmarchēs&quot; or &quot;merarchēs&quot; (to a lesser degree also referred as &quot;topotērētēs&quot;). The main provincial governors and their deputies held equal military and administrative duties within the main sub-division inside a thema, a &quot;tourma&quot;. These deputies, or any deputy or representative of the Strategos, or of any other military governor, were generally called &quot;Ek prosopou&quot;, second to them the &quot;Krites&quot; or &quot;Praitor&quot; were responsible for the judicial matters inside a Theme. Although the range of tasks of the &quot;Krites&quot; or &quot;Praitor&quot; were neither fixed nor dogmatic, as they are shown assisting in various military campaigns or, on occasions, replacing the Strategos in his military duties.

Due to the lack of action or large-scale battles in the thematas of mainland Greece, by the 12th century most of these came to be governed directly by the Megas doux, under him the &quot;Krites&quot; or &quot;Archons&quot; of the various coastal cities. The &quot;themes&quot;, now made up of several &quot;Archontates,&quot; was accommodated and repurposed solely for the income and maintenance of the Byzantine navy, fulfilling a tax supporting role in contrast from the more active and military themas of &quot;Strategos&quot; and &quot;Katepanos&quot; focussed in Asia Minor. The duties of said governors were limited to the collection of the various maritime taxes of their governorships; the management of the various urban centers such as Athens, Corinth or Thebes; and a basic level of protection for its provinces against pirates and any other parties.

During the &quot;classic&quot; or middle period of the Byzantine state (8th-late 11th centuries), a new, court-centered system emerged. In this, dignities of a certain level were awarded with new titles derived from older, now obsolete, public offices. A senatorial class remained in place, which incorporated a part of the upper officialdom; every official from the rank of &quot;protospatharios&quot; (literally &quot;first sword-bearer&quot;; originally the head of the Emperor&#x27;s bodyguards) was considered a member of it. During this period, multiple families remained important for several centuries, and several Emperors rose from the aristocracy. Two groups can be distinguished: a metropolitan civil nobility and a provincial military one, the latter remaining regionally based and having land-holdings, but apparently no military forces of their own, in contrast to contemporary Western Europe.

The backbone of Byzantine administration and economy (until the fall of Constantinople) was the joint tax liability system of the different communities inside a &quot;théma,&quot; duties which were carried out by provincial officials such as the &quot;epoptes&quot;, &quot;exisotes,&quot; and &quot;praktores&quot; of the different bureaus. A Theme was made up of several individuals and institutions, such as the various lands that the monasteries owned &quot;(episkepsis)&quot;, the soldiers&#x27; farming lands &quot;(stratiotai),&quot; the estates &quot;(proasteion)&quot; of the land owners &quot;(dynatoi)&quot; and the peasants &quot;(geōrgikē)&quot;, with most of a village or town &quot;(chora or komai)&quot; being made up of the latter. These were the main source of a constant and rapid revenue that ultimately derived from the earlier Hellenistic fiscal and administrative principle of &quot;&quot;epibole&quot;.&quot; &quot;Epibole&quot; had served as an accessible tool for the Hellenistic kingdoms for the simple income and rapid collection of taxes by deputies towards various rural communities in the war-time Hellenistic period, after having been adopted and adapted from the late Roman and early Byzantine province of Egypt, which had kept its own former fixed fiscal system, proving this measure to be an indirect consequence of the multiple wars and invasions that Byzantium had to deal throughout its history.

After the reforms of Alexios I, the system underwent various changes in which, due to the desperate state of the empire and the urgent need for income to finance its military campaigns and strengthen its borders, several simplifications and concessions were made. The theme system established under the Komnenoi would remain the administrative basis of the Byzantine state until its final fall in 1453, differing in few key aspects from its administrative predecessors; it highlighted a greater centralization of power. The various Themes had been divided into smaller districts called &quot;Katepanakia&quot; which in turn were made up of the various towns and villages &quot;(chora)&quot;, the monastic estates &quot;(episkepsis)&quot;, the estates of the dynatoi &quot;(proasteion)&quot;, and the various &quot;pronoia&quot; grants. The Themes were ruled by a &quot;Doux&quot;, who was positioned by the emperor directly, commonly a relative of his or a close aristocrat to the Basileus. The Katepanakia inside the Theme were ruled by a deputy of the Doux called a &quot;Praktor&quot; or &quot;&quot;Energon&quot;,&quot; they were appointed either by the monarch or the Doux himself, with the primary task of the collection of taxes and a second role in the maintenance of basic order, administration and justice in his district.

Alexios fiscal reforms allowed an institution or individual to catalog and group their land domains and, through it, their fiscal obligations, in a document referred as &quot;praktikon&quot;. The new reform essentially broke from the integrity of the &quot;chora&quot; or village tax, as its new purpose was the collection of the various taxes regardless of whether collection was by an institution, individual or the village itself, essentially offering it to the highest bidder. Although a simplification, it was not an improvement, as it pushed a variety of villages and towns to eventually be added to the different &quot;episkpesis&quot; of either the adjoining monasteries or of the various well-resourced &quot;dynatoi&quot; landowners, who would become responsible for both their fiscal obligations as monastic institutions, or as individuals, and for the fiscal obligations of the various towns and villages in their domain. This trend culminated in the eventual disappearance of the fiscal individuality that each commune or town had enjoyed, something which emperors like Basil II had fought and delayed with special taxes such as the allelengyon. Becoming one of several towns within the estates of the different institutions and individuals of the time was an unbearable phenomenon for multiple communes due to the various fiscal tolerances that the &quot;basileus&quot; offered the different monastic institutions and their estates, further accelerating the disappearance of the fiscal individuality of the villages and towns.

The 10th and 11th centuries saw a rise in importance of the aristocracy, and an increased number of new families entering it. The catastrophic losses in the latter 11th century again prompted a reorganization of the imperial administrative system, at the hands of the new Komnenos dynasty: the older offices and titles fell gradually into disuse, while an array of new honorifics emerged, which signified primarily the closeness of their recipient&#x27;s familial relationship to the Emperor. The Komnenian-led Empire, and later their Palaiologan successors, were based primarily on the landed aristocracy, keeping the governance of the state tightly controlled by a limited number of intermarrying aristocratic families; for instance in the 11th and 12th century, only 80 civil and 64 military noble families have been identified, a small number for so large a state. Finally, in the Palaiologan system as reported by pseudo-Kodinos, one can discern the accumulated nomenclature of centuries, with formerly high ranks having been devalued and others taking their place, and the old distinction between office and dignity having vanished.

==Imperial titles==

These were the highest titles, usually limited to members of the imperial family or to a few select foreign rulers whose friendship the Emperor desired.

=== Titles used by the emperors ===

* Basileus (βασιλεύς), the Greek word for &quot;sovereign&quot; — Originally referred to any king in the Hellenistic period or in any Greek-speaking area of the Roman Empire. It also referred to the Shahs of Persia. Heraclius adopted it in 629, and it became the Greek word for &quot;emperor.&quot; Heraclius also used the titles &quot;autokrator&quot; (αὐτοκράτωρ – &quot;autocrat,&quot; &quot;self-ruler&quot;) and &quot;kyrios&quot; (κύριος – &quot;Lord&quot;). The Byzantines reserved the term &quot;basileus&quot; among Christian rulers exclusively for the emperor in Constantinople, and referred to Western European kings as &quot;rēgas&quot;, a Hellenized form of the Latin word &quot;rex&quot; (&quot;king&quot;). The feminine form &quot;basilissa&quot; referred to an empress. Empresses were addressed as &quot;eusebestatē avgousta&quot; (&quot;Most Pious Augusta&quot;), and were also called &quot;kyria&quot; (&quot;Lady&quot;) or &quot;despoina&quot; (the female form of &quot;despotes&quot;, see below). Primogeniture, or even heredity, were not legally established in Byzantine imperial succession, because in principle the Roman Emperor was selected by common acclamation of the Senate, the People and the Army. This was rooted firmly in the Roman &quot;republican&quot; tradition, whereby hereditary kingship was rejected and the Emperor was nominally the convergence of several offices of the Republic onto one person. Multiple emperors, anxious to safeguard their firstborn son&#x27;s right to the throne, had them crowned as co-emperors when they were still children, thus assuring that upon their own death the throne would not be even momentarily vacant. In such a case the need for an imperial selection never arose. In several cases, the new Emperor ascended the throne after marrying the previous Emperor&#x27;s widow, or indeed after forcing the previous Emperor to abdicate and become a monk. Several emperors were also deposed because of perceived inadequacy, for example after a military defeat, and some were murdered.
* Porphyrogennētos (πορφυρογέννητος), &quot;born in the purple&quot; — Derived from Hellenistic bureaucracy, emperors wanting to emphasize the legitimacy of their ascent to the throne appended this title to their names, meaning they were born to a reigning emperor in the delivery room of the imperial palace (called the &quot;Porphyra&quot; because it was paneled with slabs of the reddish-purple stone porphyry), and were therefore legitimate beyond any claim to the contrary.
* Autokratōr (αὐτοκράτωρ), &quot;self-ruler&quot; — Originally equivalent to &quot;imperator&quot;, and was used by the emperors.
* Basileus Autokratōr () – A combination of titles reserved for the senior of several ruling co-emperors (συμβασιλεῖς, &quot;symbasileis&quot;), and denoted the person who held substantive political power.

===Titles used by the imperial family===
* Despotēs (δεσπότης), &quot;Lord&quot; — Used by the emperors themselves since the time of Justinian I, and was an honorific address for the sons of reigning emperors. Hellenistic rulers had used it extensively, and during Byzantine times often featured in coins, in lieu of &quot;Basileus&quot;. In the 12th century, Manuel I Komnenos made it a separate title, the highest &quot;awarded&quot; title after the emperor. The first such &quot;despotēs&quot; was actually a foreigner, Bela III of Hungary, signifying that Hungary was considered a Byzantine tributary state. In later times, a despot could be the holder of a despotate; for example, the Despotate of Morea, centred at Mistra, was held by the heir to the Byzantine throne after 1261. The feminine form, &quot;despoina&quot;, referred to a female despot or the wife of a despot, but it was also used to address the Empress.
* Sebastokratōr (σεβαστοκράτωρ), &quot;Venerable Ruler&quot; — Created by Alexios I Komnenos as a combination of &quot;autokratōr&quot; and &quot;sebastos&quot; (see below). The first &quot;sebastokratōr&quot; was Alexios&#x27; brother Isaakios. It was essentially a meaningless title, which signified only a close relationship with the Emperor, but ranked immediately after the &quot;despotēs&quot;. The feminine form was &quot;sebastokratorissa&quot;. The first foreigner to be called &quot;sebastokratōr&quot; was Stefan Nemanjić of Serbia, who was given the title in 1191. A Bulgarian aristocrat by the name Kaloyan also used the title.
* Kaisar (), &quot;Caesar&quot; — Originally, as in the late Roman Empire, it was used for a subordinate co-emperor or the heir apparent, and was first among the &quot;awarded&quot; dignities. The office enjoyed extensive privileges, prestige and power. When Alexios I created &quot;sebastokratōr&quot;, &quot;kaisar&quot; became third in importance, and fourth after Manuel I created &quot;despotēs&quot;. The feminine form was &quot;kaisarissa&quot;. However, it remained an office of importance, and was awarded to a few high-ranking and distinguished officials, and was only rarely awarded to foreigners. Justinian II named Tervel, khan of the Bulgars, &quot;kaisar&quot; in 705; the title then developed into the Slavic term tsar or czar (from Latin through Bulgarian and then into Russian, Serbian etc.). Title was also awarded to George II of Georgia. Andronikos II Palaiologos also named Roger de Flor, leader of the Catalan Grand Company, &quot;kaisar&quot; in 1304.
* Nobelissimos (νωβελίσσιμος), from the Latin &quot;Nobilissimus&quot; (&quot;most noble&quot;) — Originally a title given to close relatives of the Emperor, subordinate only to the &quot;kaisar&quot;. During the Komnenian period, the title was awarded to officials and foreign dignitaries, diluting its status. The title &quot;Prōtonobelissimos&quot; was created in its stead, until it too started to decline, only to be replaced by a further augmented form: &quot;Prōtonobelissimohypertatos&quot;. By the late Palaiologan era, the former had vanished, while the latter was a provincial official.
* Kouropalatēs (κουροπαλάτης), from the Latin &quot;cura palatii&quot;, &quot;charge of the palace&quot; — First attested in the time of Justinian I, it was the official in charge of running the imperial palace. However, the authority and wealth deriving from this position, as well as the close proximity to the Emperor, meant that it accumulated prestige. It was awarded to important members of the imperial family, but from the 11th century onwards, it declined, and was usually awarded to the vassal rulers of Armenia and Georgia.
* Sebastos (σεβαστός), &quot;August One&quot; — This title is the literal Greek translation of the Latin term &quot;Augustus&quot; or &quot;Augoustos&quot;, which was sometimes used by the emperors. As a separate title, it appeared in the latter half of the 11th century, and was extensively awarded by Alexios I Komnenos to his brothers and relations. The female version of the title was &quot;sebastē&quot;. The special title Protosebastos (&quot;First Venerable One&quot;) was created for Hadrianos, Alexios&#x27; second brother, and awarded also to the Doge of Venice and the Sultan of Iconium. During the 12th century, it remained in use for the Emperor&#x27;s and the &quot;sebastokratōr&quot;&#x27;s children, and senior foreign dignitaries. However, the parallel processes of proliferation and devaluation of titles during the 12th century resulted in the creation of a bewildering array of variations, by using the prefixes &quot;pan&quot; (&quot;all&quot;), &quot;hyper&quot; (&quot;above&quot;), &quot;prōto&quot; (&quot;first&quot;): examples include Pansebastos and Panhypersebastos. Few of them actually survived past the 12th century, and all of them rapidly declined in importance.

==Court titles from the 8th to 11th centuries==

In the 8th–11th centuries, according to information provided by the &quot;Taktikon Uspensky&quot;, the &quot;Klētorologion&quot; of Philotheos (899) and the writings of Constantine Porphyrogennetos, below the imperial titles, the Byzantines distinguished two distinct categories of dignities (): the &quot;dignities by award&quot; (), which were purely honorific court titles and were conferred by the award of a symbol of rank, and the &quot;dignities by proclamation&quot; (), which were offices of the state and were conferred by imperial pronouncement. The former were further divided into three subcategories, depending on who was eligible for them: different sets of titles existed for the &quot;Bearded Ones&quot; (&quot;βαρβάτοι&quot; from Latin &quot;barbati&quot;, i.e. not eunuchs), the eunuchs () and women. State officials usually combined titles from both main categories, so that a high official would be both &quot;magistros&quot; (an &quot;awarded&quot; title) and &quot;logothetēs tou dromou&quot; (a &quot;proclaimed&quot; office).

=== Titles for the &quot;bearded ones&quot; ===
The &quot;by award&quot; titles for the &quot;Bearded Ones&quot; (non-eunuchs) were, in descending order of precedence:
* Proedros (), &quot;president&quot; — Originally reserved for eunuchs (see below), it was opened up in the mid-11th century to &quot;Bearded Ones&quot; as well, especially military officials.
* Magistros () – In the early Byzantine state, the &quot;magister officiorum&quot; was one of the most senior officials, but as his duties were gradually relegated to other officials, by the 8th century, only the title was left. It remained a high honour, and only rarely awarded until the 10th century. By the early 10th century, there were 12, the first in precedence among them bearing the title of &quot;prōtomagistros&quot;. Thereafter the number of its holders was inflated, and the office vanished sometime in the 12th century.
* Vestarches (), &quot;head of the vestai&quot; — Adopted in the latter half of the 10th century for high-ranking eunuchs, it began being awarded to &quot;bearded&quot; senior military officers and judicial officials of Constantinople around 1050, before disappearing in the early 12th century.
* Vestes () – A senior honorific title, first attested under John I Tzimiskes. Awarded to both eunuchs and non-eunuchs, it survived until the early 12th century. The term is etymologically connected to the vestiarion, the imperial wardrobe, but despite earlier attempts to connect the vestai and the related title of vestarchēs, the head of the class of the vestai (see above), with the officials of the vestiarion (see below), no such relation appears to have existed.
* Anthypatos (), &quot;proconsul&quot; — Originally the highest rank for provincial governors, it survived the creation of the Theme system, until, in the 9th century, it too became a purely honorific title. The variant prōtanthypatos was created in the 11th century to counter its decline in importance, but both disappeared by the end of the 12th century.
* Patrikios (), &quot;patrician&quot; — Established as the highest title of nobility by Constantine the Great, it remained one of the highest dignities until its disappearance in the Komnenian period, awarded to high-ranking officials, including eunuchs, and foreign rulers. The spouses of patricians bore the title &quot;patrikia&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;zōstē patrikia&quot;, see below).
* Prōtospatharios (), &quot;first &quot;spatharios&quot;&quot; — As its name signifies, it originally was the title borne by the leader of the &quot;spatharioi&quot; (&quot;swordbearers,&quot; the Emperor&#x27;s bodyguards). For instance, in the 6th century Narses bore this title. It later became one of the most common high court titles, awarded to senior officials such as the &quot;logothetai&quot;, the commanders of the imperial &quot;tagmata&quot;, or the &quot;strategoi&quot; in charge of a theme. The title of &quot;prōtospatharios&quot; also signified admittance to the Senate. The office survived until the Palaiologan period, but had declined to the 35th place of the hierarchy.
* Dishypatos (), &quot;twice consul&quot; — A rare dignity, which originated possibly in the 8th century.
* Spatharokandidatos () – a blend word of the titles spatharios and kandidatos, both of which were types of palace guards in the 4th–6th centuries. The earliest references to the title occur in early 8th century and the title is clearly attested only from the early 9th century on. Its distinctive badge (brabeion) was a golden chain (maniakion) worn around the chest.[1][3] 
* Spatharios (), &quot;spatha-bearer&quot; — As their name signifies, the &quot;spatharioi&quot; were initially a special corps of imperial guards (a &quot;spatha&quot; is a kind of sword). They performed specific duties inside the imperial palace. The title survived until the early 12th century.
* Hypatos (), &quot;consul&quot; or &quot;The supreme one&quot; — As in the Roman Republic and Empire, the title was initially given each year to two distinguished citizens (the &quot;ordinary consuls&quot;), until Justinian I halted the practice due to the extraordinary expenditure it involved. It too became a purely honorific title. The title continued to be occasionally assumed by emperors on accession until the end of the 7th century. Honorary consuls however continued to be named, as attested by seals bearing the titles &quot;hypatos&quot; or &quot;apo hypatōn&quot; (&quot;former consul&quot;). The title was often conferred to the rulers of south Italian city-states.
* Stratōr (), &quot;Groom (horses)&quot;.
* Kandidatos () – From the Latin &quot;candidatus&quot;, so named because of their white tunics. They were originally a select group of guards, drawn from the &quot;Scholae Palatinae&quot;. The title disappeared in the Komnenian period.
* Basilikos mandatōr (), &quot;imperial or royal messenger&quot;.
* Vestētōr () — Officers of the imperial wardrobe (Latin &quot;vestiarium&quot;).
* Silentiarios () — Originally a group of courtiers responsible for the maintenance of order (including respectful silence) in the palace.
* Stratēlatēs (), Greek equivalent of the Latin &quot;magister militum&quot;, and apoeparchōn ( or &quot;&quot;), equivalent of the Latin &quot;ex praefectis&quot; — These two titles are listed as equal by Philotheos. Both were still high dignities in the 6th century, but were devalued afterward.

=== Titles for eunuchs ===
By descending order of precedence, the &quot;by award&quot; titles for the eunuchs were:
* Proedros (), &quot;president&quot; — This was an entirely new rank introduced in the 960s by Nikephoros II Phokas and first awarded to Basil Lekapenos, the eunuch &quot;parakoimōmenos&quot;. The holder of this dignity was also the president of the Senate, and the term &quot;proedros&quot; was often used to denote precedence, e.g. &quot;proedros&quot; of the &quot;notarioi&quot; for the &quot;prōtonotarios&quot;. The title was widely awarded in the 11th century, when it was opened up to non-eunuchs, prompting the creation of the &quot;prōtoproedros&quot; to distinguish the most senior amongst its holders. It disappeared in the latter 12th century.
* Vestarches () – Adopted in the latter half of the 10th century for high-ranking eunuchs, it was awarded to &quot;bearded&quot; senior military officers and judicial officials of Constantinople from ca. 1050 on. It disappeared in the early 12th century.
* Patrikios – Same as for the &quot;Bearded Ones&quot;.
* Vestes () – Same as for the &quot;Bearded Ones&quot;.
* Praipositos () – From the Latin &quot;praepositus&quot;, &quot;placed before&quot;.
* Prōtospatharios – Same as for the &quot;Bearded Ones&quot;.
* Primikērios () – From the Latin &quot;primicerius&quot;, &quot;first in the list&quot;.
* Ostiarios (&quot;ὀστιάριος&quot;) – From the Latin &quot;ostiarius&quot;, &quot;doorkeeper, usher&quot;.
* Spatharokoubikoularios (), &quot;sword-chamberlain&quot; — A ceremonial sword-carrier assigned to the personal guard of the emperor. It later became a simple court rank.
* Koubikoularios () – From the Latin &quot;cubicularius&quot;, &quot;chamberlain&quot;.
* Nipsistiarios (), from Greek νίπτειν, &quot;to wash hands&quot;) — The &quot;nipsistiarios&quot; was tasked with holding a gold, gem-encrusted water basin and assisting the emperor in performing the ritual ablutions before he exited the imperial palace or performed ceremonies.

=== Titles for women ===
*Zōstē patrikia (), &quot;Girded &quot;patrikia&quot;&quot; — This title, reserved for women, was given to the empress&#x27; ladies of honour, and, according to Philotheos, ranked high in hierarchy, above even the &quot;magistros&quot; and &quot;proedros&quot; and just below the &quot;kouropalates&quot;. The title is known from the early 9th century, and disappeared in the 11th century. Otherwise women bore the female forms of their husbands&#x27; titles.

=== Titles for foreigners ===
* Exousiastes (), &quot;one who executes authority&quot; — It was a style applied in the empire to some sovereign foreign rulers.

== Palace offices ==

* Parakoimomenos (literally, &quot;one who sleeps nearby&quot;) — The High Chamberlain who slept in the Emperor&#x27;s bedchamber. Usually a eunuch, during the 9th–10th centuries the holders of this office often functioned as &quot;de facto&quot; chief ministers of the Empire.
* Protovestiarios – Usually a minor relative of the emperor who took care of the emperor&#x27;s personal wardrobe, especially on military campaigns. He was also sometimes responsible for other members of the imperial household, and the emperor&#x27;s personal finances. The older term, from before the time of Justinian I, was &quot;curopalata&quot; (or &quot;kouropalates&quot; in Greek). This was derived from &quot;kourator&quot; (curator), an earlier official responsible for financial matters. The &quot;vestiarios&quot; was a subordinate official. The &quot;protovestiaria&quot; and &quot;vestiaria&quot; performed the same functions for the empress.
* Papias – Concierge of the imperial palaces, responsible for opening and closing the palace gates each day.
* Pinkernes – Originally the emperor&#x27;s cupbearer, later a senior honorific title.
* Kanikleios – The keeper of the imperial inkstand, one of the senior officials of the imperial chancery. In the Komnenian and Palaiologan period, some of its holders were &quot;de facto&quot; chief ministers of the Empire.
* Epi tes trapezes (ὁ ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης), &quot;the one in charge of the table&quot; — Official responsible for attending to the imperial table during banquets.

==Military offices==
===Army===
* Exarchos – The exarchs were governors of remote parts of the empire such as Italy or Africa. They enjoyed a greater degree of independence than other provincial governors, combining both civil and military authority, practically acting as viceroys.
* Domestikos – The &quot;domestikoi&quot; were originally imperial guards, who later functioned as senior staff officers in the Late Roman army. In the Byzantine period, they were among the highest military offices, and included:
** Megas domestikos, Grand Domestic – The overall commander of the army.
** Domestikos tōn scholōn, Domestic of the Schools – The commander of the &quot;Scholai&quot;, originally a number of guards units, later a Tagma. This was a prestigious title, and by the late 9th century, its holder functioned as commander in chief of the army. In ca. 959, the post was divided, with one domestic for the East and one for the West.
** Domestikos tōn thematōn, Domestic of the Themes – The commander and organizer of the military themes; there was one for the European themes and one for Asian themes.
* Katepanō – The governor of a greater area combining two or more themes, such as the Catepan of Italy, a title developed in the 9th century.
* Stratēgos – A military and later also civil commander of a theme, who often also had the title of &quot;doux&quot;. The term is basically equivalent to &quot;general&quot; or &quot;admiral&quot;, as it was used in both branches of service.
* Tourmarchēs – The commander of a &quot;tourma&quot;, a military unit of battalion size.
* Prōtostratōr – Initially the Emperor&#x27;s stable master, under the Komnenian and Palaiologan emperors the term was used for the second-ranking commander of the army.
* Stratopedarchēs, Master of the Camp – In charge of making sure the army was stocked with food and arms.
* Hoplitarchēs or archēgētēs – Commander of all infantry in an army. The title first appeared in the mid-10th century, when the infantry was reorganized and gained in importance.
* Prōtokentarchos and kentarchos – Commanders of a smaller division of the army in the field. The name was derived from the Latin centurion.
* Merarchēs – Commander of a division &quot;(meros)&quot; of the army. Usually, each army was divided into two to three such commands.
* Taxiarchēs or chiliarchēs – Commander of an infantry regiment (&quot;taxiarchia&quot; or &quot;chiliarchia&quot;) in the army.
* Kavallarios – A title borrowed from the Latin &quot;caballarius&quot;, it originally meant a cavalry soldier. During the Palaiologan period, it became a minor court title.

===Navy===

* Megas doux, Megaduke or Grand Duke — The basic equivalent of the modern Lord High Admiral. The office was created by Alexios I Komnenos, when he combined the remnants of the imperial and thematic fleets into a single imperial fleet. By the end of the Palaiologos dynasty the megaduke was head of the government and bureaucracy, not just the navy.
* Amirales — Greek version of &quot;Admiral&quot;, introduced via Sicilian practice; an office founded in the late Palaiologan era for Western mercenary leaders and rarely held, the &quot;amirales&quot; was the deputy of the &quot;megas doux&quot;.
* Megas droungarios — Initially the commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy; after the creation of the &quot;megas doux&quot; his lieutenant, in charge of the naval officers.
* Droungarios – The title existed both in the army and the navy. In the navy of the 8th–11th centuries, a &quot;droungarios&quot; headed a fleet, either the central imperial fleet or one of the thematic fleets; in the army he headed a Droungos, a roughly battalion-sized grouping.
* Komēs or droungarokomēs – The commander of a squadron of dromons.
* Kentarchos or nauarchos – The captain of a ship.

===Other military titles===
* Ethnarchēs — The &quot;ethnarch&quot;, commander of foreign troops.
* Konostaulos — Greek form of Latin Comes stabuli &quot;count of the stable&quot; and various European feudal titles such as English &quot;constable&quot;; the chief of the Frankish mercenaries.
* Hetaireiarchēs — The chief of the barbarian mercenaries, the &quot;Hetaireia&quot;, successor to the &quot;Foederati&quot;. Initially subdivided into Greater (&quot;Megalē&quot;), Middle (&quot;Mesē&quot;) and Little (&quot;Mikra&quot;) &quot;Hetaireia&quot;.
* Akolouthos, &quot;Acolyte&quot; — The chief of the Varangian Guard from the Komnenian era onwards.
* Manglavitai — A category of palace guards, armed with sword and cudgel (&quot;manglavion&quot;). Under the command of a &quot;Prōtomanglavitēs&quot;.
* Topotērētēs, &quot;place-holder&quot; or &quot;lieutenant&quot; — Found at various levels of the hierarchy, as deputies to commanders of the imperial &quot;tagmata&quot;, deputy to a &quot;drungarios&quot;.

==Administrative offices==

Byzantine administrative nature was characterized by its versatility and unfixed duties in constant role change depending on a specific situation. The vast Byzantine bureaucracy had a number of titles, more varied than aristocratic and military titles. In Constantinople there were normally hundreds, if not thousands, of bureaucrats at any time. Like members of the Church and the military, they wore elaborately differentiated dress, often including huge hats. These are some of the more common ones, including non-nobles who also directly served the emperor.

* Praetorian prefect — The Praetorian prefecture was set up by Augustus as the command of the imperial Guard in Rome. It was developed by Diocletian into a civil office, whereby a handful of Prefects each acted for the Emperor with responsibility for a cluster of dioceses and provinces. Each received regular reports on administration from the provincial governors, had treasuries of his own, and paid and supplied the army with food. He was also a supreme judge of appeal; in cases which were brought before his court from a lower tribunal there was no further appeal to the Emperor. He could issue, on his own authority, praetorian edicts, but they concerned only matters of detail. The office was abolished in the 7th century as part of wide-ranging civil and military reforms, and evolved into that of the &quot;domestikos&quot;. 
* Basileopatōr (βασιλεοπάτωρ), &quot;Father of the Emperor&quot; — An exceptional title, granted only twice in Byzantine history. Although a &quot;basileopatōr&quot; was not the emperor&#x27;s actual father, and the title did not necessarily denote any familial relationship at all, both awardees were the father-in-law of the emperor: Stylianos Zaoutzes under Leo VI the Wise and Romanos I Lekapenos briefly as regent for Constantine VII, before he raised himself to co-emperor. It ranked first among the &quot;decreed&quot; offices, and entailed wide-ranging administrative duties.
* Protasekretis, &quot;First Secretary&quot; — an earlier title for the head of the , responsible for keeping official government records and head of the class of senior secretaries known as &quot;asekretis&quot;. Other subordinates included the &quot;chartoularios,&quot; in charge of imperial documents; the &quot;kastrensios,&quot; a chamberlain in the palace; the &quot;mystikos,&quot; a private secretary; and the &quot;eidikos,&quot; a treasury official.
* Protonotarios — Mainly used during the middle Byzantium (8th to 10th c.), also &quot;First Secretary&quot; but chiefly employed as chief financial and executive officer of either each thema/province, directly under its governor-general, or as imperial secretary in various government ministries in the capital. Charged with the provisioning of the thematic troops ahead of a campaign, the Protonotarios at times resembled a Commissar of the USSR, answering only to the emperor. During the late Byzantine era, the title was only encountered at the Palaiologan court, as the emperor&#x27;s private secretary. In post-imperial times the title was linked to a higher administrative position with the Orthodox Church authorities.
* Chartoularios tou vestiariou, literally &quot;keeper of documents for the Public Wardrobe&quot; (see Vestiarion) — Responsible for minting gold and silver coins and equipping the fleet.
* Logothetēs, &quot;one who accounts, calculates or ratiocinates&quot; (literally &quot;one who sets the word&quot;) — A secretary in the extensive bureaucracy, who did various jobs depending on the exact position. In the middle and late Byzantine Empire, it rose to become a senior administrative title, equivalent to a modern minister or secretary of state. Different offices of Logothetes included:
** Megas logothetēs, Grand Logothete — the head of the logothetes, personally responsible for the legal system and treasury, somewhat like a chancellor in western Europe.
** Logothetēs tou dromou, Drome Logothete — the head of diplomacy and the postal service.
** Logothetēs tōn oikeiakōn, Logothete of the &quot;oikeiakoi&quot; — the exact functions of this office are unclear.
** Logothetēs tou genikou, General Logothete — responsible for taxation. Also acted as a secretary in later cases.
** Logothetēs tou stratiotikou, Military Logothete — a civilian, in charge of distributing pay to the army.

Logothetes originally had some influence on the emperor, but the posts eventually became honorary. In the later empire the Grand Logothete was replaced by the &quot;mesazōn&quot; (&quot;mediator&quot;).

Other administrators included:

* Eparch of Constantinople — The urban prefect of Constantinople.
* Quaestor — Originally an accountant or auditor, the office eventually became a judicial one for Constantinople.
* Tribounos, translation of Latin tribune — Responsible for maintenance of roads, monuments, and buildings in Constantinople (which were the responsibility of the Aedile, not the Tribunes in earlier Latin speaking times.)
* Magister (&quot;magister officiorum&quot;, &quot;magister militum&quot;, &quot;maistor&quot; in Greek) — An old Roman term, master of offices and master of the army; by the time of Leo III, these had become honorary titles and were eventually discarded.
* Sakellarios, &quot;treasurer; purse-bearer&quot; — Under Heraclius, an honorary supervisor of the other palace administrators, logothetes, etc. Later, the chief financial comptroller of the Empire.
* Praetor, Latin for &quot;Man who goes before; first man.&quot; — One of the oldest of Roman titles, predating the Roman Republic, the title&#x27;s use morphed considerably through the years. By the time of Theodosius I (379-395) it meant the leading municipal magistrate (like a modern Mayor) but from late 10th century until 1204, a civil governor of a theme.
* Kephale, &quot;head&quot; — The governor of a small province, usually a town and its surrounding territory, in the Palaiologan period
* Horeiarios — In charge of distributing food from the state granaries.
* Archon

The &quot;protasekretis&quot;, &quot;logothetes&quot;, prefect, praetor, quaestor, &quot;magister&quot;, and &quot;sakellarios&quot;, among others, were members of the senate.

===Court life===
At the peaceful height of Middle Byzantium, court life &quot;passed in a sort of ballet&quot;, with precise ceremonies prescribed for every occasion, to show that &quot;Imperial power could be exercised in harmony and order&quot;, and &quot;the Empire could thus reflect the motion of the Universe as it was made by the Creator&quot;, according to the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, who wrote a &quot;Book of Ceremonies&quot; describing in enormous detail the annual round of the Court. Special forms of dress for multiple classes of people on particular occasions are set down; at the name-day dinner for the Emperor or Empress various groups of high officials performed ceremonial &quot;dances&quot;, one group wearing &quot;a blue and white garment, with short sleeves, and gold bands, and rings on their ankles. In their hands they hold what are called &quot;phengia&quot;&quot;. The second group do just the same, but wearing &quot;a garment of green and red, split, with gold bands&quot;. These colours were the marks of the old chariot-racing factions, the four now merged to just the Blues and the Greens, and incorporated into the official hierarchy. As in the Versailles of Louis XIV, elaborate dress and court ritual probably were at least partly an attempt to smother and distract from political tensions.

Eunuchs also participated in court life, typically serving as attendants to noble women or assisting the emperor when he took part in religious ceremonies or removed his crown. Eunuchs in the early Byzantine Empire were usually foreigners, and they were often seen as having a low status. This changed in the 10th century, when the social status of eunuchs increased and members of the educated Byzantine upper class began to become eunuchs.

However, even by the time of Anna Comnena, with the Emperor away on military campaigns for much of the time, this way of life had changed considerably, and after the Crusader occupation it virtually vanished. A French visitor was shocked to see the Empress going to church far less well attended than the Queen of France would have been. The Imperial family abandoned the Great Palace for the relatively compact Palace of Blachernae.

<doc id="302876" wikidata="Q374803" url="?curid=302876" title="Benny Morris">
<text>Benny Morris (; born 8 December 1948) is an Israeli historian. He was a professor of history in the Middle East Studies department of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in the city of Beersheba, Israel. Morris was initially associated with the group of Israeli historians known as the &quot;New Historians&quot;, a term he coined to describe himself and historians Avi Shlaim, Ilan Pappé and Simha Flapan. 

Morris&#x27;s 20th century work on the Arab–Israeli conflict and especially the Israeli–Palestinian conflict has won praise and criticism from both sides of the political divide. Despite regarding himself as a Zionist, he writes, &quot;I embarked upon the research not out of ideological commitment or political interest. I simply wanted to know what happened.&quot; One of Morris major works is the 1989 book &quot;The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947–1948&quot; which based on then recently declassified Israeli archives, demonstrated that the 1948 exodus of Palestinian refugees were in large part a response to deliberate expulsions and violence by forces loyal to Israel, rather than the result of orders by Arab commanders as had often been historically claimed. 

Scholars have perceived an ideological shift in Morris&#x27;s work starting around 2000, during the Second Intifada. Morris&#x27;s perspective has been described as having become more conservative and more negative towards Palestinians, viewing the 1948 expulsions as a justified act.

==Biography==
Morris was born on 8 December 1948 in kibbutz Ein HaHoresh, Israel, the son of Jewish immigrants from the United Kingdom.

His father, Ya&#x27;akov Morris, was an Israeli diplomat, historian, and poet, while his mother, Sadie Morris, was a journalist. According to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Benny Morris &quot;grew up in the heart of a left-wing pioneering atmosphere.&quot; His family moved to Jerusalem when Morris was one year old. During his youth, he lived for two long periods in New York, where his father was an envoy in Israel&#x27;s foreign service, and attended the Ramaz School.

Morris served in the Israel Defense Forces as an infantryman, including in the Paratroopers Brigade, from 1967 to 1969. He saw action on the Golan Heights front during the Six-Day War and served on the Suez Canal during the War of Attrition. He was wounded in 1969 by an Egyptian shell in the Suez Canal area and was discharged from active service four months later, but continued to serve in the military reserve until 1990. He completed a BA in modern European history from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and then received a doctorate in modern European history from the University of Cambridge in 1977. His thesis was on Anglo-German relations in the 1930s. Unable to find a job in academia, he took a position as a reporter for &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;. He would work for &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; for 12 years. 

Morris served in the 1982 Lebanon War as an army reservist, taking part in the Siege of Beirut in a mortar unit. He also covered the war as a correspondent for &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;. He interviewed the residents of the Rashidieh Palestinian refugee camp near Tyre, which helped pique his interest in the Palestinian refugee issue. In 1986, he did reserve duty in the West Bank. In 1988, when he was called up for reserve duty in Nablus, he refused to serve on ideological grounds, as he viewed Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories as a necessity and did not want to take part in suppressing the First Intifada, later recalling that &quot;my sympathies were with the rebels. I thought the Arabs really meant what they said and they were out to liberate the West Bank and Gaza from military occupation. I thought that was just. And therefore, I refused to fight them.&quot; He was sentenced to three weeks in military prison and was imprisoned for 19 days, with the remaining two deducted for good behavior. He was subsequently discharged from reserve service.

While working at &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; in the 1980s, Morris began reading through the Israel State Archives, at first looking at the history of the Palmach, then turning his attention to the origins of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight. Mainstream Israeli historiography at the time explained the 1948 Palestinian exodus from their towns and villages as having been driven by fear, or by instructions from Arab leaders. Morris found evidence that there had been expulsions in some cases. Another event that Morris revealed for the first time based on his archive study was the contacts between the Israeli officials and the Lebanese Kataeb Party figures, including Elias Rababi, in the period 1948–1951. The related news reports were also published in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; in 1983.

After publishing &quot;The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem&quot; 1988, Morris was widely criticized in Israel. He left &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; in 1991 as part of a mass walkout of journalists due to a perceived right-wing turn in the newspaper and began searching for an academic position, but found that no university would hire him. He continued researching and writing but found it impossible to support his family from his work and had to rely on loans from friends. He considered leaving Israel but was persuaded to stay by Ezer Weizman, then Israel&#x27;s president, who found him a job at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in 1997.

From 2015–18, Morris served as the Goldman Visiting Israeli Professor in Georgetown University&#x27;s Department of Government.

He lives in Srigim (Li On) and is married with three children.

==Political views==
=== 2004 &quot;Haaretz&quot; interview ===
In 2004, &quot;Haaretz&quot; published an interview with Morris conducted by Ari Shavit that has generated significant controversy. Morris told Shavit that his views changed in 2000 after the Palestinian rejection of President Clinton&#x27;s peace accords and the outbreak of the Second Intifada. He had originally viewed the First Intifada as a legitimate uprising against foreign occupation, and was imprisoned for refusing to serve in the occupied territories as a reservist. In contrast, he has characterized the Second Intifada as a war waged by the Palestinians against Israel with the intention of bringing Israeli society to a state of collapse. According to Morris, &quot;The bombing of the buses and restaurants really shook me. They made me understand the depth of the hatred for us.&quot;

Morris said that Israel was justified in uprooting the Palestinian &#x27;fifth column&#x27; after the Arabs attacked the infant state, and that proportion should be employed when considering the &quot;small war crimes&quot; committed by Israel. In the interview, Morris stated that:

There is no justification for acts of rape. There is no justification for acts of massacre. Those are war crimes. But in certain conditions, expulsion is not a war crime. I don&#x27;t think that the expulsions of 1948 were war crimes. [...]
There are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing. I know that this term is completely negative in the discourse of the 21st century, but when the choice is between ethnic cleansing and genocide—the annihilation of your people—I prefer ethnic cleansing.

Morris criticised David Ben-Gurion for not fully carrying out such a plan, saying: &quot;In the end, he faltered. ... If Ben-Gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleansed the whole country ... If he had carried out a full expulsion—rather than a partial one—he would have stabilized the State of Israel for generations.&quot; Morris also said: &quot;I feel sympathy for the Palestinian people, which truly underwent a hard tragedy. I feel sympathy for the refugees themselves. But if the desire to establish a Jewish state here is legitimate, there was no other choice. It was impossible to leave a large fifth column in the country. From the moment the Yishuv was attacked by the Palestinians and afterward by the Arab states, there was no choice but to expel the Palestinian population. To uproot it in the course of war.&quot;

He sees the Jews as the greater victims, as they are &quot;a small minority in a large sea of hostile Arabs who want to eliminate us.&quot; According to him, &quot;Arab people gained a large slice of the planet. [...They] have 22 states. The Jewish people did not have even one state. There was no reason in the world why it should not have one state. Therefore, from my point of view, the need to establish this state in this place overcame the injustice that was done to the Palestinians by uprooting them.&quot;

Morris told Shavit that he still describes himself as being left-wing because of his support for the two-state solution, but he believes his generation will not see peace in Israel. He has said, &quot;I don&#x27;t see the suicide bombings as isolated acts. They express the deep will of the Palestinian people. That is what the majority of the Palestinians want.&quot; On the subject of &quot;people the Palestinian society sends to carry out the terrorist attacks,&quot; he calls them &quot;serial killers&quot; and &quot;barbarians who want to take our lives&quot;.

In the same interview, Morris called Israeli Arabs &quot;a time bomb,&quot; claiming that &quot;their slide into complete Palestinization has made them an emissary of the enemy that is among us. They are a potential fifth column.&quot; On the subject of the potential expulsion of Israeli-Arabs, he stated that &quot;in the present circumstances it is neither moral nor realistic. The world would not allow it, the Arab world would not allow it, it would destroy the Jewish society from within. But I am ready to tell you that in other circumstances, apocalyptic ones, which are liable to be realized in five or ten years, I can see expulsions. If we find ourselves with atomic weapons around us, or if there is a general Arab attack on us and a situation of warfare on the front with Arabs in the rear shooting at convoys on their way to the front, acts of expulsion will be entirely reasonable. They may even be essential.&quot;

Morris called the Israel–Palestinian conflict a facet of a global clash of civilisations between Islam and the Western World in the &quot;Haaretz &quot;interview, saying, &quot;There is a deep problem in Islam. It&#x27;s a world whose values are different. A world in which human life doesn&#x27;t have the same value as it does in the West, in which freedom, democracy, openness and creativity are alien...Revenge plays a central part in the Arab tribal culture. Therefore, the people we are fighting and the society that sends them have no moral inhibitions.&quot;

In response, Ari Shavit commented on Morris&#x27; justification for the expulsion of the Arabs in 1948 by contrasting (the more recent) &quot;citizen&quot; Morris with (the earlier) &quot;historian&quot; Morris, and noting that, at times &quot;citizen Morris and historian Morris worked as though there is no connection between them, as though one was trying to save what the other insists on eradicating.&quot;

Morris later denied the term &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; with regard to the actions undertaken by Jewish forces in Israel during the year 1948. He said that possibly, the term might apply in a limited or partial context to Lod and Ramla. He says that according to historical records, approximately 160,000 Arabs remained within the territories of Israel post-1948 and that while many were indeed expelled, a significant number managed to return and retained their status as citizens of the newly established Jewish state.

=== Israeli government ===
In July 2019, Morris has sharply criticized the restrictions under the Netanyahu government of access to historical documents related to the 1948 Palestinian Arab exodus, referring to them as &quot;totalitarian.&quot; At the same time, Morris pointed out that much of the criticism of this policy is hypocritical, because the archives of the Arab states remain entirely closed.

In August 2023, Morris was one of more than 1,500 U.S., Israeli, Jewish and Palestinian academics and public figures who signed an open letter stating that Israel operates &quot;a regime of apartheid&quot; and calling on US Jewish groups to speak out against the occupation in Palestine. In an October 2023 interview, he stated that he does not consider Israel an &quot;apartheid state&quot;, but that when signing the letter mentioned above he meant to refer to Israel&#x27;s occupation of the West Bank as &quot;an apartheid regime based on nationalism&quot;.

Morris is critical of the Israeli settlements, calling it &quot;counterproductive&quot; because it will not assure Israel&#x27;s security. He called some of the settlers &quot;right-wing fanatics&quot;, who are violent towards their Palestinian neighbors. According to him, Israel should have withdrawn from the West Bank immediately after the Six-Day War, allowed the Jordanians to reoccupy the territory.

=== Statements on Iran ===
In an op-ed piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in July 2008, Morris wrote: &quot;Iran&#x27;s leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program. Bar this, the best they could hope for is that Israel&#x27;s conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities. To be sure, this would mean thousands of Iranian casualties and international humiliation. But the alternative is an Iran turned into a nuclear wasteland.&quot; In an interview with the Austrian newspaper &quot;Der Standard&quot; in May 2008, Morris argued that a pre-emptive nuclear strike on Iran may have to be used as a last resort to stop the Iranian nuclear program. Morris reiterated this view in an op-ed in &quot;Haaretz&quot; in June 2024, writing, &quot;If Israel proves incapable of destroying the Iranian nuclear project using conventional weaponry, then it may not have any option but to resort to its nonconventional capabilities.&quot;

=== Israel&#x27;s future ===
In a 2019 interview with &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Morris took a pessimistic view of Israel&#x27;s future, arguing that the Palestinians would not compromise and that ultimately &quot;a situation in which we rule an occupied people that has no rights cannot persist in the 21st century, in the modern world&quot;. He claimed that as soon as the Palestinians did have rights, Israel would no longer be a Jewish state, and that it would descend into intercommunal violence with Jews ultimately becoming a persecuted minority and those who could emigrating. According to Morris, &quot;the Palestinians look at everything from a broad, long-term perspective. They see that at the moment, there are five-six-seven million Jews here, surrounded by hundreds of millions of Arabs. They have no reason to give in, because the Jewish state can&#x27;t last. They are bound to win. In another 30 to 50 years they will overcome us, come what may.&quot;

==Published works==

===&quot;The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947–1948&quot;===

In his 1988 book, Morris retraces the stages of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight. He meticulously examines the fate of each abandoned Palestinian village, the reason for its depopulation, and its subsequent fate. Morris also considers Israel&#x27;s decision to bar the refugees&#x27; return and the international context. This book laid the foundation for Morris&#x27; reputation as the preeminent historian of the 1948 War.

===&quot;1948 and After&quot;===
&quot;1948 and After: Israel and the Palestinians&quot; (1990) is a collection of essays dedicated to the Palestinian exodus of 1948 and subsequent events. It analyses Mapai and Mapam policy during the exodus, the IDF report of July 1948 on its causes, Yosef Weitz&#x27;s involvement in the events, and some cases of expulsions that occurred in the fifties.

=== &quot;The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited&quot; ===
Published in 2004, the book documents new archival material revealed during 25 years since Morris&#x27; earlier work. His work considers what happens in urban communities, such as Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa.

===&quot;1948: A History of the First Arab–Israeli War&quot;===
Morris demolishes misconceptions and provides a detailed account of the war between various factions that year that caused the creation of the modern state of Israel. The book has been described as &quot;the most definitive study of the first Arab-Israeli war.&quot;

===&quot;One State, Two States&quot;===
Morris contends that there is no two-state solution to the Middle East crisis, and that the one-state solution is not viable because of Arab unwillingness to accept a Jewish national presence in the Middle East and cultural differences including less Arab respect for human life and rule of law. He suggests the possibility of something like a three-state solution in the form of a Palestinian confederation with Jordan.

===&quot;The Thirty-Year Genocide, Turkey&#x27;s Destruction of its Christian Minorities, 1894-1924&quot;===

The book describes the Ottoman/Turkish destruction of the Armenian, Greek and Assyrian communities by the successive Ottoman, Young Turks&#x27; and Atatürk regimes, in which some two million Christians were murdered by their Muslim neighbors.

==Praise and criticism==
Morris has won praise and criticism from both sides of the political divide. Some commentators criticised Morris for being reluctant to accept the implications of the evidence he presents in his work.

=== Avi Shlaim ===
Avi Shlaim, retired professor of international relations at the University of Oxford, and himself a New Historian, writes that Morris investigated the 1948 exodus of the Palestinians &quot;as carefully, dispassionately, and objectively as it is ever likely to be&quot;, and that &quot;The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem&quot; is an &quot;outstandingly original, scholarly, and important contribution&quot; to the study of the issue. Shlaim writes that many of Morris&#x27;s critics cling to the tenets of &quot;Old History&quot;, the idea of an Israel born untarnished, a David fighting the Arab Goliath. He argues that these ideas are simply false, created not by historians but by the participants in the 1948 war, who wrote about the events they had taken part in without the benefit of access to Israeli government archives, which were first opened up in the early 1980s.

=== Shlomo Ben-Ami ===
Shlomo Ben-Ami, a historian and former Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs, praised Morris&#x27; book &quot;The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited&#x27; (2008)&quot;. He called it &quot;the single most important work on the thorniest moral and political issue underlying the Israeli-Palestinian conundrum&quot; and suggested it is likely to become &quot;the most definitive study of the first Arab-Israeli war.&quot;

However, Ben-Ami criticised Morris&#x27; drawing of an &quot;awkward symmetry&quot; between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the &quot;forced emigration&quot; of Jews from the Arab world. Like Yoav Gelber, he was also unconvinced by Morris&#x27; characterization of the 1948 conflict as an Islamic Jihad.

In his own book &quot;Scars of War, Wounds of Peace&quot;, Ben-Ami observed that Morris&#x27; &quot;thesis about the birth of the Palestine refugee problem being not by design but by the natural logic and evolution of war is not always sustained by the very evidence he himself provides: &#x27;cultured officers ... had turned into base murderers and this not in the heat of battle ... but out of a system of expulsion and destruction; the less Arabs remained, the better; this principle is the political motor for the expulsions and atrocities&#x27; [quoting from Morris&#x27; major 2004 work &#x27;The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited&#x27;]&quot;.

=== Efraim Karsh ===
Efraim Karsh, professor of Mediterranean Studies at King&#x27;s College London, writes that Morris engages in what Karsh calls &quot;five types of distortion&quot;. According to Karsh, Morris &quot;misrepresents documents, resorts to partial quotes, withholds evidence, makes false assertions, and rewrites original documents... [he] tells of statements never made, decisions never taken, events that never happened ... at times [he] does not even take the trouble to provide evidence... He expects his readers to take on trust his assertions that fundamental contradictions exist between published accounts and the underlying documents...he systematically falsifies evidence. Indeed, there is scarcely a document that he does not twist. This casts serious doubt on the validity of his entire work.&quot; In addition he claimed to expose a serious gap between Morris&#x27; text and the original diary of Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel.

Yezid Sayigh, professor of Middle East Studies in the Department of War Studies at King&#x27;s College London, writes of Karsh&#x27;s criticism, &quot;[t]his is not the first time that Efraim Karsh has written a highly self-important rebuttal of revisionist history. He is simply not what he makes himself out to be, a trained historian (nor political/social scientist).&quot; (Karsh responds that he has an undergraduate degree in modern Middle Eastern history, and Arabic language and literature, and a doctorate in political science and international relations.) Sayigh urges academics to compose &quot;robust responses [to Karsh] that make sure that any self-respecting scholar will be too embarrassed to even try to incorporate the Karsh books in his/her teaching or research because they can&#x27;t pretend they didn&#x27;t know how flimsy their foundations are&quot;.

Morris responds that Karsh&#x27;s article is a &quot;mélange of distortions, half-truths, and plain lies that vividly demonstrates his profound ignorance of both the source material (his piece contains more than fifty footnotes but is based almost entirely on references to and quotations from secondary works, many of them of dubious value) and the history of the Zionist–Arab conflict. It does not deserve serious attention or reply.&quot; Anita Shapira, Dean of Tel Aviv University, argues &quot;thirty of [Karsh&#x27;s] references actually refer to writings by Shlaim and Morris, and fifteen others cite primary sources, and the rest refer to studies by major historians...&quot;

Morris elsewhere argues that Karsh &quot;belabor[s] minor points while completely ignoring, and hiding from his readers, the main pieces of evidence&quot; and argued, &quot;... Karsh, while claiming to have &#x27;demolished&#x27; the whole oeuvre, in fact deal[t] with only four pages of &quot;Birth&quot;. These pages tried to show that the Zionist leadership during 1937–38 supported a &#x27;transfer solution&#x27; to the prospective Jewish state&#x27;s &#x27;Arab problem. Commenting on the &quot;Revisited&quot; version of Morris&#x27;work, Karsh states that in &quot;an implicit acknowledgement of their inaccuracy, Morris has removed some of &quot;The Birth&quot;&#x27;s most inaccurate or distorted quotations about transfer.&quot;

=== Norman Finkelstein and Nur Masalha ===
Morris has also been criticised by Norman Finkelstein and Nur Masalha. They argue that Morris&#x27;s conclusions have a pro-Israeli bias, in that he has not fully acknowledged that his work rests largely on selectively released Israeli documentation, while the most sensitive documents remain closed to researchers, and has more broadly treated the evidence in Israeli documents in an uncritical way, and not taking into account that they are, at times, apologetic. In relations to specific work on the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, they assert that Morris minimised the number of expulsions, with Finkelstein noting than many events classified by Morris as &quot;abandonment&quot; or &quot;military assault on settlement&quot; were actually expulsions, and that when the conclusions of Morris&#x27; evidence are harsh for the Israelis he has tended to give them a less incriminating spin.

In a reply to Finkelstein and Masalha, Morris answers he &quot;saw enough material, military and civilian, to obtain an accurate picture of what happened&quot;, that Finkelstein and Masalha draw their conclusions with a pro-Palestinian bias, and that with regard to the distinction between military assault and expulsion they should accept that he uses a &quot;more narrow and severe&quot; definition of expulsions. Morris holds to his conclusion that there was no transfer policy.

=== Ilan Pappé ===
Benny Morris wrote a review critical of Ilan Pappé&#x27;s book &quot;A History of Modern Palestine&quot; for &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Morris called Pappé&#x27;s book &quot;truly appalling&quot;. He says it subjugates history to political ideology, and &quot;contains errors of a quantity and a quality that are not found in serious historiography&quot;. Replying, Pappé accused Morris of using mainly Israeli sources, and disregarding Arab sources, which – Pappé alleged – Morris &quot;cannot read&quot;.

=== Michael Palumbo ===

Michael Palumbo, author of &quot;The Palestinian Catastrophe: The 1948 Expulsion of a People from Their Homeland&quot;, reviewing the first edition of Morris&#x27;s book on Palestinian refugees, criticises Morris&#x27;s decision, which Palumbo thinks characteristic of Israeli revisionist historians generally, to rely mainly on official, &quot;carefully screened&quot; Israeli sources, especially for radio transcripts of Arab broadcasts, while disregarding unofficial Israeli sources such as transcripts from the BBC and CIA, many of which point to a policy of expulsion. He says Morris failed to supplement his work in Israeli archives, many still classified, by U.N., American, and British archival sources that Palumbo considers objective on such issues as IDF atrocities, as well as oral testimonies of Palestinians and Israelis, which can be reliable if their substance can be independently verified. Palumbo commendsMorris&#x27; regard for documentation is indeed commendable, were it not for his tendency to choose sources which support his views, while avoiding those document collections which contain information inconsistent with his principal arguments. His decision not to use the testimony of Israeli veterans is unfortunate, since some of them have spoken candidly about Israeli atrocities and expulsion of civilians at Deir Yassin, Lydda–Ramle and Jaffa.

=== Baruch Kimmerling ===

In an article in HNN, Baruch Kimmerling discusses Morris&#x27; 2004 &quot;Haaretz&quot; interview in which Morris states:if he was already engaged in expulsion, maybe he should have done a complete job. I know that this stuns the Arabs and the liberals and the politically correct types. But my feeling is that this place would be quieter and know less suffering if the matter had been resolved once and for all. If Ben-Gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleaned the whole country - the whole Land of Israel, as far as the Jordan River. It may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake. If he had carried out a full expulsion - rather than a partial one - he would have stabilized the State of Israel for generations... Even the great American democracy could not have been created without the annihilation of the Indians. There are cases in which the overall, final good justifies harsh and cruel acts that are committed in the course of history.

Kimmerling describes Morrris&#x27;s views as &quot;shocking&quot; and says that Morris &quot;has abandoned his historian’s mantle and donned the armor of a Jewish chauvinist who wants the Land of Israel completely cleansed from Arabs&quot; He criticizes the analysis of Morris as misunderstanding the impact of the refugee problem on the current conflict, and the magnitude of an even larger refugee population.

=== Yoav Gelber ===
Yoav Gelber has praised Morris&#x27;s 2008 book on the origins of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, stating that &quot;In general, however, &quot;1948&quot; is a praiseworthy achievement of research and analysis, the work of a historian unwilling to rest on his already considerable laurels.&quot; On the other hand, Gelber criticised Morris for granting too much importance to the militant Islamic rhetoric of the period.

<text>Max Black (February 24, 1909 – August 27, 1988) was an Azerbaijan-born British-American philosopher who was a leading figure in analytic philosophy in the years after World War II. He made contributions to the philosophy of language, the philosophy of mathematics and science, and the philosophy of art, also publishing studies of the work of philosophers such as Frege. His translation (with Peter Geach) of Frege&#x27;s published philosophical writing is a classic text.

==Early life and education==
Black was born on February 24, 1909, in Baku, in present-day Azerbaijan. He is of Jewish descent. In 1912, he moved with his family to London, where he grew up. 

He studied mathematics at Queens&#x27; College at the University of Cambridge, where he developed an interest in the philosophy of mathematics. Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, G. E. Moore, and Frank P. Ramsey were all at Cambridge at that time, and their influence on Black may have been considerable. He graduated in 1930, and was awarded a fellowship to study at Göttingen for a year.

==Career==
From 1931 to 1936, he was mathematics master at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle.

His first book was &quot;The Nature of Mathematics&quot; (1933), an exposition of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; and of current developments in the philosophy of mathematics.

Black made notable contributions to the metaphysics of identity. In his &quot;The Identity of Indiscernibles&quot;, Black presents an objection to Leibniz&#x27; Law by means of a hypothetical scenario in which he conceives two distinct spheres having exactly the same properties, thereby contradicting Leibniz&#x27; second principle in his formulation of &quot;The Identity of Indiscernibles&quot;. By virtue of there being two objects, albeit with identical properties, the existence of two objects, even in a void, denies their identicality.

He lectured in mathematics at the Institute of Education in London from 1936 to 1940. In 1940 he moved to the United States and joined the Philosophy Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. In 1946, he accepted a professorship in philosophy at Cornell University. In 1948, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Black advised the philosophy dissertation of American novelist William H. Gass. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963. 

==Death==
Black died in Ithaca, New York age 79. His younger brother was the architect Misha Black.

<text>Sir Anthony John Patrick Kenny (born 16 March 1931) is a British philosopher whose interests lie in the philosophy of mind, ancient and scholastic philosophy, the philosophy of religion, and the philosophy of Wittgenstein of whose literary estate he is an executor. With Peter Geach, he has made a significant contribution to analytical Thomism, a movement whose aim is to present the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas in the style of analytic philosophy. He is a former president of the British Academy and the Royal Institute of Philosophy. He has two sons, Charles James Kenny and Robert Alexander Kenny. He also has four grandchildren.

==Education and early career==
Kenny was born in Liverpool on 16 March 1931, the son of John and Margaret (Jones) Kenny.

Kenny initially trained as a Roman Catholic priest at the Venerable English College, Rome, where he received a degree of Licentiate of Sacred Theology (STL) degree. He was ordained in 1955 and served as a curate in Liverpool (1959–63).

Having received his DPhil from the University of Oxford (St Benet&#x27;s Hall) in 1961, he also worked as an assistant lecturer at the University of Liverpool (1961–63). However, he questioned the validity of Roman Catholic doctrine and has been an agnostic since the late 1960s. He was returned to the lay state in 1963, but according to canon law his priestly ordination remains valid. He was never released from his obligation of clerical celibacy and was therefore excommunicated on his marriage to Nancy Gayley in 1965.

==Academic career==
During 1963–64, Kenny was a lecturer in philosophy at Exeter and Trinity Colleges, Oxford, and he served as University Lecturer 1965–78. From 1964 until 1978, he was a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford and Senior Tutor during the periods 1971–72 and 1976–78. He was Master of Balliol from 1978 to 1989 and subsequently an Honorary Fellow. During the period 1989–99, he was both Warden of Rhodes House (manager of the Rhodes Scholarship program) and Professorial Fellow of St John&#x27;s College and thereafter Fellow Emeritus. He was Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1984 to 2001 (Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Development, 1999–2001). He retired in 2001.

Within the university, Kenny was Wilde Lecturer in Natural and Comparative Religion (1969–72), Speaker&#x27;s Lecturer in Biblical Studies (1980–83), a member of the Hebdomadal Council (1981–93), Vice-chairman of the Libraries Board (1985–88), Curator of the Bodleian Library (1985–88) and a Delegate, and member of the Finance Committee, of Oxford University Press (1986–93). From 1972 until 1973 he was the editor of &quot;The Oxford Magazine&quot;. He received the degree of DLitt in 1980 and the honorary degree of DCL. in 1987.

He was a member of the Board of the British Library 1991-96 and Chairman 1993–96, and has served as Chairman of the Society for Protection of Science and Learning (1989–93), of the British National Corpus Advisory Board (1990–95), of the British Irish Association (1990–94), and of the Board of the Warburg Institute (1996–2000). He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1974 and served as a member of the Council of the Academy 1985–88, as Vice President 1986–88 and President 1989–93.

Kenny was Gifford Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh 1972–73 and at the University of Glasgow in 1988, Stanton Lecturer at the University of Cambridge 1980–83, and Bampton Lecturer at Columbia University in 1983. He was a visiting professor at University of Chicago, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Cornell University, Stanford University and Rockefeller University.

He has been a member of the American Philosophical Society since 1993, and of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters since 1993, and an Honorary Fellow of Harris Manchester College, Oxford since 1996, and of the School of Advanced Study, University of London since 2002 (Senior Distinguished Fellow 2002–3). He has received the honorary degrees of D.Litt. from Bristol (1982), Liverpool (1988), Glasgow (1990), Trinity College, Dublin (1992), Hull (1993), Sheffield (1995), and Warwick (1995), of D.Hum.Litt. from Denison University, Ohio (1986) and Lafayette College, Pennsylvania (1990) and of D.C.L. from the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast (1994).

==Philosophical work==
Although deeply interested in traditional Catholic teaching and continuing to take limited participation in the Catholic Mass, Kenny now explicitly defines himself as an agnostic, explaining in the third chapter of his &quot;What I Believe&quot; (2006) both why he is not a theist and why he is not an atheist:&quot;Many different definitions may be offered of the word &#x27;God&#x27;. Given this fact, atheism makes a much stronger claim than theism does. The atheist says that no matter what definition you choose, &#x27;God exists&#x27; is always false. The theist only claims that there is some definition which will make &#x27;God exists&#x27; true. In my view, neither the stronger nor the weaker claim has been convincingly established.&quot;He goes on: &quot;the true default position is neither theism nor atheism, but agnosticism ... a claim to knowledge needs to be substantiated; ignorance need only be confessed.&quot;

That (as Kenny puts it) &quot;there is no such being as the God of traditional natural theology: the concept of God propounded by scholastic theologians and rationalistic philosophers is an incoherent one&quot; is, according to William Hasker, the &#x27;most important conclusion&#x27; of Kenny&#x27;s &#x27;essay in natural theology&#x27; &quot;The God of the Philosophers&quot; (1979). Hasker notes, however, that (in the book&#x27;s final chapter) Kenny &quot;considers seriously the possible existence of a God who, while differing somewhat in his attributes from the God of traditional natural theology, could still be identified with the saving God of theistic faith.&quot;

Hasker further notes that Kenny &quot;concludes by suggesting that one who is in doubt about God may rationally pray for enlightenment about his existence and nature:&quot; As Kenny asserts: &quot;It surely is no more unreasonable than the act of a man adrift in the ocean, trapped in a cave, or stranded on a mountainside, who cries for help though he may never be heard or fires a signal which may never be seen.&quot; And if there is such a God, then such prayer &quot;cannot be less pleasing to him than the attitude of a man who takes no interest in a question so important, or in a question so difficult would not welcome assistance beyond human powers.&quot;.

Kenny has written extensively on Thomas Aquinas and modern Thomism. In &quot;The Five Ways&quot; (1969), he deals with St. Thomas&#x27; five proofs of God. In it, he argues that none of the proofs Thomas sets out is wholly valid, and instead sets out to show the flaws in the five ways. His arguments range from the problem of Aristotelian motion in a modern scientific context, to the ability of contingent beings to cause eternality in other contingent beings. His objections all focus on a modern interpretation of St. Thomas.

Kenny candidly describes the predicament of the beginning of the universe, which both atheists and agnostics face, writing, &quot;According to the Big Bang Theory, the whole matter of the universe began at a particular time in the remote past. A proponent of such a theory, at least if he is an atheist, must believe that the matter of the universe came from nothing and by nothing.&quot;

In &quot;What Is Faith?&quot; (1992), Kenny addresses &quot;the question of whether belief in God, and faith in a divine world, is a reasonable or rational state of mind.&quot; He criticises the idea, &quot;common to theists like Aquinas and Descartes and to an atheist like Russell,&quot; that &quot;Rational belief [is] either self-evident or based directly or indirectly on what is evident&quot;, which he terms &quot;foundationalism&quot; following Plantinga, arguing that foundationalism is a self-refuting idea.

During the 2000s Kenny wrote a history of Western philosophy, released in four parts from 2004 to 2007; the four books were released together as &quot;A New History of Western Philosophy&quot; in 2010.

In &quot;Brief Encounters&quot; (2018) Kenny says Derrida was &quot;corrupted by being famous. He gave up philosophy for rhetoric, and rhetoric of a particularly childish kind&quot;. Writing of Richard Dawkins, he suggests that &quot;moving from &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot; to &quot;The God Delusion&quot; is like moving from the &quot;Financial Times&quot; to &quot;The Sun&quot;.&quot; He commends Denis Noble&#x27;s principle of &#x27;Biological Relativity&#x27; which states (according to Kenny) that &quot;in biology there is no privileged level of causation: living organisms and multilevel open systems in which the behaviour at any level depends on higher and lower levels&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
Kenny was made a Knight Bachelor by Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom in 1992 and has been an Honorary Bencher of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn since 1999.

In October 2006, Kenny was awarded the American Catholic Philosophical Association&#x27;s Aquinas Medal for his significant contributions to philosophy.

Portraits of Kenny hang in the British Academy, London, and at Balliol College and Rhodes House, Oxford.

<text>Crispin James Garth Wright (; born 21 December 1942) is a British philosopher, who has written on neo-Fregean (neo-logicist) philosophy of mathematics, Wittgenstein&#x27;s later philosophy, and on issues related to truth, realism, cognitivism, skepticism, knowledge, and objectivity. He is Professor of Philosophical Research at the University of Stirling, and taught previously at the University of St Andrews, University of Aberdeen, New York University, Princeton University and University of Michigan.

==Life and career==

Wright was born in Surrey and was educated at Birkenhead School (1950–61) and at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in Moral Sciences in 1964 and taking a PhD in 1968. He took an Oxford BPhil in 1969 and was elected Prize Fellow and then Research Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford, where he worked until 1978. He then moved to the University of St. Andrews, where he was appointed Professor of Logic and Metaphysics and then the first Bishop Wardlaw University Professorship in 1997. From fall 2008 to spring 2023, he was professor in the Department of Philosophy at New York University (NYU). He has also taught at the University of Michigan, Oxford University, Columbia University, and Princeton University. Crispin Wright was founder and director of Arché at the University of St. Andrews, which he left in September 2009 to take up leadership of the Northern Institute of Philosophy (NIP) at the University of Aberdeen. Once NIP ceased operations in 2015, Wright moved to the University of Stirling.

==Philosophical work==

In the philosophy of mathematics, he is best known for his book &quot;Frege&#x27;s Conception of Numbers as Objects&quot; (1983), where he argues that Frege&#x27;s logicist project could be revived by removing the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension (sometimes referred to as Basic Law V) from the formal system. Arithmetic is then derivable in second-order logic from Hume&#x27;s principle. He gives informal arguments that (i) Hume&#x27;s principle plus second-order logic is consistent, and (ii) from it one can produce the Dedekind–Peano axioms. Both results were proven informally by Gottlob Frege (Frege&#x27;s Theorem), and would later be more rigorously proven by George Boolos and Richard Heck. Wright is one of the major proponents of neo-logicism, alongside his frequent collaborator Bob Hale. He has also written &quot;Wittgenstein and the Foundations of Mathematics&quot; (1980).

In general metaphysics, his most important work is &quot;Truth and Objectivity&quot; (Harvard University Press, 1992). He argues in this book that there need be no single, discourse-invariant thing in which truth consists, making an analogy with identity. There need only be some principles regarding how the truth predicate can be applied to a sentence, some &#x27;platitudes&#x27; about true sentences. Wright also argues that in some contexts, probably including moral contexts, superassertibility will effectively function as a truth predicate. He defines a predicate as superassertible if and only if it is &quot;assertible&quot; in some state of information and then remains so no matter how that state of information is enlarged upon or improved. Assertiveness is warrant by whatever standards inform the discourse in question. Many of his most important papers in philosophy of language, epistemology, philosophical logic, meta-ethics, and the interpretation of Wittgenstein have been collected in the two volumes published by Harvard University Press in 2001 and 2003.

In epistemology, Wright has argued that G. E. Moore&#x27;s proof of an external world (&quot;Here is one hand&quot;) is logically valid but cannot transmit warrant from its premise to the conclusion, as it instantiates a form of epistemic circularity called by him &quot;warrant transmission failure&quot;. Wright has also developed a variant of Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s hinge epistemology, introduced in Wittgenstein&#x27;s On Certainty as a response to radical skepticism. According to hinge epistemology, there are assumptions or presuppositions of any enquiry – called &quot;hinge propositions&quot; – that cannot themselves be rationally doubted, challenged, established or defended. Examples of hinges are the propositions that there are universal regularities in nature, that our sense organs are normally reliable, and that we do not live in a skeptical scenario (such as that in which we are globally hallucinated by a Cartesian evil demon or the more recent simulation hypothesis). Wright instead contends that certain hinge propositions can actually be rationally held because there exists a type of non-evidential, &quot;a priori&quot; warrant – which Wright calls &quot;epistemic entitlement&quot; – for accepting them as true. In collaboration with epistemologist Luca Moretti, Wright has further developed this theory to the effect that we are entitled to &quot;ignore&quot; the possibility that we live in a skeptical scenario.

<text>Peter Thomas Geach (29 March 1916 – 21 December 2013) was a British philosopher who was Professor of Logic at the University of Leeds. His areas of interest were philosophical logic, ethics, history of philosophy, philosophy of religion and the theory of identity.

==Early life==
Peter Geach was born in Chelsea, London, on 29 March 1916. He was the only son of George Hender Geach and his wife Eleonora Frederyka Adolfina &quot;née&quot; Sgonina. His father, who was employed in the Indian Educational Service, would go on to work as a professor of philosophy in Lahore and later as the principal of a teacher-training college in Peshawar.

His parents&#x27; marriage was unhappy and quickly broke up. Until the age of four, he lived with his maternal grandparents, who were Polish immigrants, in Cardiff. After this time he was placed in the care of a guardian (until his father returned to Britain) and contact with his mother and her parents ceased. He attended Llandaff Cathedral School in Cardiff and, later, Clifton College.

His father, who had studied with Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore at Cambridge, taught him philosophy starting with logic.

In 1934 Geach won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1938 with first-class honours in &quot;literae humaniores&quot;. At Oxford, he increasingly engaged in intellectual clashes with Catholics, through which he discovered the Catholic faith, later converting to the Roman Catholic Church. He later described it:
==Academic career==
Geach spent a year (1938–39) as a Gladstone Research Student, based at St Deiniol&#x27;s Library, Hawarden.

Geach refused to join the British Army in the Second World War and, as a conscientious objector, was employed in the war years in timber production. Though Geach himself recounts that he did later try, unsuccessfully, to join the Free Polish Army.

Following the end of the war in 1945, he undertook further research at Cambridge.

In 1951, Geach was appointed to his first substantive academic post, as assistant lecturer at the University of Birmingham, going on to become Reader in Logic. In 1966 Geach resigned in protest at the University’s decision to create an Institute of Contemporary Culture. In his resignation letter he said he had no wish to stay at a university which &quot;preferred Pop Art to Logic&quot;. In the same year he was appointed Professor of Logic in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Leeds. Geach retired from his Leeds chair in 1981 with the title Emeritus Professor of Logic.

At various times Geach held visiting professorships at the universities of Cornell, Chicago, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Warsaw.

==Philosophical work==
His early work includes the classic texts &quot;Mental Acts&quot; and &quot;Reference and Generality&quot;, the latter defending an essentially modern conception of reference against medieval theories of supposition. His Catholic perspective was integral to his philosophy. He was perhaps the founder of analytical Thomism (though the current of thought running through his and Elizabeth Anscombe&#x27;s work to the present day was only ostensibly so named forty years later by John Haldane), the aim of which is to synthesise Thomistic and analytic approaches. Geach was a student and an early follower of Ludwig Wittgenstein whilst at the University of Cambridge.

Geach defends the Thomistic position that human beings are essentially rational animals, each one miraculously created. He dismissed Darwinistic attempts to regard reason as inessential to humanity, as &quot;mere sophistry, laughable, or pitiable.&quot; He repudiated any capacity for language in animals as mere &quot;association of manual signs with things or performances.&quot;

Geach dismissed both pragmatic and epistemic conceptions of truth, commending a version of the correspondence theory proposed by Thomas Aquinas. He argues that there is one reality rooted in God himself, who is the ultimate truthmaker. God, according to Geach, &quot;is&quot; truth. While they lived, he saw W. V. Quine and Arthur Prior as his allies, in that they held three truths: that there are no non-existent beings; that a proposition can occur in discourse without being there asserted; and that the sense of a term does not depend on the truth of the proposition in which it occurs. He is said to have invented the famous ethical example of the stuck potholer, when arguing against the idea that it might be right to kill a child to save their mother.

In metaethics, a debate developed in the 1960s and 1970s as to whether it was possible to logically derive categorical &#x27;ought&#x27; statements from &#x27;is&#x27; statements. The debate famously involved Richard Hare, Max Black, Philippa Foot and John Searle among others. Geach made a notable contribution to this debate with a paper published in 1977, which purported to derive one categorical &#x27;ought&#x27; from purely factual premises.

Geach has famously argued that the notion of absolute identity should be abandoned, to be replaced with relative identity predicates.

==Honours==
Geach was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1965. He was elected an honorary fellow of Balliol College in 1979. He was awarded the papal cross &quot;Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice&quot; by the Holy See in 1999 for his philosophical work.

==Marriage and children==
His wife and occasional collaborator was the philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe. Both converts to Catholicism, they were married at Brompton Oratory in 1941 and went on to have seven children. They co-authored the 1961 book &quot;Three Philosophers&quot;, with Anscombe contributing a section on Aristotle and Geach one each on Aquinas and Gottlob Frege. For a quarter century they were leading figures in the Philosophical Enquiry Group, an annual confluence of Catholic philosophers held at Spode House in Staffordshire that was established by Columba Ryan in 1954.

==Death==
Peter Geach died on 21 December 2013 at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge and is buried in the same grave as his wife in (what is now) the Ascension Parish Burial Ground.

<doc id="302888" wikidata="Q342646" url="?curid=302888" title="Michael Dummett">
<text>Sir Michael Anthony Eardley Dummett (; 27 June 1925 – 27 December 2011) was an English academic described as &quot;among the most significant British philosophers of the last century and a leading campaigner for racial tolerance and equality.&quot; He was, until 1992, Wykeham Professor of Logic at the University of Oxford. He wrote on the history of analytic philosophy, notably as an interpreter of Frege, and made original contributions particularly in the philosophies of mathematics, logic, language and metaphysics. 

He was known for his work on truth and meaning and their implications to debates between realism and anti-realism, a term he helped to popularize. In mathematical logic, he developed an intermediate logic, a logical system intermediate between classical logic and intuitionistic logic that had already been studied by Kurt Gödel: the Gödel–Dummett logic. In voting theory, he devised the Quota Borda system of proportional voting, based on the Borda count, and conjectured the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem together with Robin Farquharson; he also devised the condition of proportionality for solid coalitions. Besides his main work in analytic philosophy, he also wrote extensively on the history of card games, particularly on tarot card games.

He was married to the political activist Ann Dummett from 1951 until his death in 2011.

==Education and army service==
Born 27 June 1925 at his parents&#x27; house, 56, York Terrace, Marylebone, London, Dummett was the son of George Herbert Dummett (1880 – 12 November 1969), later of Shepherd&#x27;s Cottage, Curridge, Berkshire, a silk merchant and rayon dealer, and Mabel Iris (1893–1980), daughter of the civil servant and conservationist Sir Sainthill Eardley-Wilmot (himself grandson of the politician Sir John Eardley-Wilmot, 1st Baronet). He studied at Sandroyd School in Wiltshire, at Winchester College as a scholar, and at Christ Church, Oxford, which awarded him a major scholarship in 1943. He was called up for military service that year and served until 1947, first as a private in the Royal Artillery, then in the Intelligence Corps in India and Malaya. In 1950 he graduated with a first in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from Oxford and was elected a Prize Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford.

==Academic career==
In 1979, Dummett became Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford, a post he held until retiring in 1992. During his term as Wykeham Professor, he held a Fellowship at New College, Oxford. He has also held teaching posts at Birmingham University, UC Berkeley, Stanford University, Princeton University, and Harvard University. He won the Rolf Schock prize in 1995, and was knighted in 1999. He was the 2010 winner of the Lauener Prize for an Outstanding Œuvre in Analytical Philosophy.

During his career at Oxford, Dummett supervised many philosophers who went on to distinguished careers, including Peter Carruthers, Adrian Moore, Ian Rumfitt, and Crispin Wright.

==Philosophical work==
Dummett&#x27;s work on the German philosopher Frege has been acclaimed. His first book &quot;&quot; (1973), written over many years, is seen as a classic. It was instrumental in the rediscovery of Frege&#x27;s work, and influenced a generation of British philosophers.

In his 1963 paper &quot;Realism&quot;, he popularised a controversial approach to understanding the historical dispute between realist and other non-realist philosophy such as idealism, nominalism, irrealism. He classed all the latter as anti-realist and argued that the fundamental disagreement between realist and anti-realist was over the nature of truth.

For Dummett, realism is best understood as semantic realism, i.e. the view that every declarative sentence in one&#x27;s language is bivalent (determinately true or false) and evidence-transcendent (independent of our means of coming to know which), while anti-realism rejects this view in favour of a concept of knowable (or assertible) truth. Historically, these debates had been understood as disagreements about whether a certain type of entity objectively exists or not. Thus we may speak of realism or anti-realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as natural numbers), moral categories, the material world, or even thought. The novelty of Dummett&#x27;s approach consisted in seeing these disputes as at base analogous to the dispute between intuitionism and Platonism in the philosophy of mathematics.

Dummett espoused semantic anti-realism, a position suggesting that truth cannot serve as the central notion in the theory of meaning and must be replaced by verifiability. Semantic anti-realism is sometimes related to semantic inferentialism.

==Activism==
Dummett was politically active, through his work as a campaigner against racism. He let his philosophical career stall in order to influence civil rights for minorities during what he saw as a crucial period of reform in the late 1960s. He also worked on the theory of voting, which led to his introduction of the Quota Borda system.

Dummett drew heavily on his work in this area in writing his book &quot;On Immigration and Refugees&quot;, an account of what justice demands of states in relationship to movement between states. Dummett, in that book, argues that the vast majority of opposition to immigration has been founded on racism, and says that this has especially been so in the UK. In the book, Dummett argued in favour of open borders and mass migration, except when states were &quot;under special threat&quot; and could therefore refuse entry.

He has written of his shock on finding anti-Semitic and &quot;extreme right-wing&quot; opinions in the diaries of Frege, to whose work he had devoted such a high proportion of his professional career.

In 1955–1956, while in Berkeley, California, Dummett and his wife joined the NAACP. In June 1956 he met Martin Luther King Jr. while visiting San Francisco, and heard from him of Alistair Cooke providing the British public with what King defined as &quot;biased and hostile reports&quot; of the Civil Rights Movement and specifically of the Montgomery bus boycott. Dummett travelled to Montgomery and wrote his own account. However, &quot;The Guardian&quot; refused to publish Dummett&#x27;s article and his refutation of Cooke&#x27;s version of the Montgomery events, even in a shortened account as a Letter to the Editor; the &quot;BBC&quot;, too, also refused to publish it.

==Elections and voting==

Dummett and Robin Farquharson published influential articles on the theory of voting, in particular conjecturing that deterministic voting rules with more than three issues faced endemic strategic voting. The Dummett–Farquharson conjecture was proved by Allan Gibbard, a philosopher and former student of Kenneth J. Arrow and John Rawls, and by the economist Mark A. Satterthwaite.

After the establishment of the Farquharson–Dummett conjecture by Gibbard and Satterthwaite, Dummett contributed three proofs of the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem in a monograph on voting. He also wrote a shorter overview of the theory of voting, for the educated public.

==Card games and tarot==
Dummett was a scholar in the field of card-game history, with numerous books and articles to his credit. He was a founding member of the International Playing-Card Society, in whose journal &quot;The Playing-Card&quot; he regularly published opinions, research and reviews of current literature on the subject; he was also a founder of the Accademia del Tarocchino Bolognese in Bologna. His historical work on the use of the tarot pack in card games, &quot;The Game of Tarot: From Ferrara to Salt Lake City&quot;, attempted to establish that the invention of Tarot could be set in 15th-century Italy. He laid the foundation for most subsequent research on the game of tarot, including exhaustive accounts of the rules of all hitherto known forms of the game. Sylvia Mann goes as far as to say that &quot;The Game of Tarot&quot; &quot;is the most important book on cards ever written.&quot;

Dummett&#x27;s analysis of the historical evidence suggested that fortune-telling and occult interpretations were unknown before the 18th century. During most of their recorded history, he wrote, Tarot cards were used to play a popular trick-taking game which is still enjoyed in much of Europe. Dummett showed that the middle of the 18th century saw a great development in the game of Tarot, including a modernized deck with French suit-signs, and without the medieval allegories that interest occultists. This coincided with a growth in Tarot&#x27;s popularity. &quot;The hundred years between about 1730 and 1830 were the heyday of the game of Tarot; it was played not only in northern Italy, eastern France, Switzerland, Germany and Austro-Hungary, but also in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and even Russia. Not only was it, in these areas, a famous game with many devotees: it was also, during that period, more truly an international game than it had ever been before or than it has ever been since...&quot;

In 1987, Dummett collaborated with Giordano Berti and Andrea Vitali on the project of a great Tarot exhibition at Castello Estense in Ferrara. On that occasion he wrote some texts for the catalogue of the exhibition.

==Roman Catholicism==
In 1944, Dummett was received into the Roman Catholic Church and remained a practising Catholic. Throughout his career, Dummett published articles on various issues then facing the Catholic Church, mainly in the English Dominican journal &quot;New Blackfriars&quot;. Dummett published an essay in the bulletin of the Adoremus Society on the subject of liturgy, and a philosophical essay defending the intelligibility of the Catholic Church&#x27;s teaching on the Eucharist.

In October 1987, one of his contributions to &quot;New Blackfriars&quot; sparked controversy by seemingly attacking currents of Catholic theology that appeared to him to diverge from orthodox Catholicism and &quot;imply that, from the very earliest times, the Catholic Church, claiming to have a mission from God to safeguard divinely revealed truth, has taught and insisted on the acceptance of falsehoods.&quot; Dummett argued that &quot;the divergence which now obtains between what the Catholic Church purports to believe and what large or important sections of it in fact believe ought, in my view, to be tolerated no longer: not if there is to be a rationale for belonging to that Church; not if there is to be any hope of reunion with the other half of Christendom; not if the Catholic Church is not to be a laughing-stock in the eyes of the world.&quot; A debate on these remarks continued for months, with the theologian Nicholas Lash and the historian Eamon Duffy among the contributors.

==Later years and family==
Dummett retired in 1992 and was knighted in 1999 for &quot;services to philosophy and to racial justice&quot;. He received the Lakatos Award in the philosophy of science in 1994 and the Rolf Schock Prize for logic and philosophy in 1995. He was elected Fellow of the British Academy in 1968, resigned in 1984, and was re-elected in 1995.

<text>Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński (; ; ; 23 August 1776 – 9 August 1853) was a Polish messianist philosopher, mathematician, physicist, inventor, lawyer, occultist and economist. 
In mathematics, he is known for introducing a novel series expansion for a function in response to Joseph Louis Lagrange&#x27;s use of infinite series. The coefficients in Wroński&#x27;s new series form the Wronskian, a determinant Thomas Muir named in 1882. As an inventor, he is credited with designing some of the first caterpillar vehicles.

==Life and work==
He was born as &quot;Hoëné&quot; in 1776 but changed his name in 1815 to Józef Wroński. Later in life he changed his name to Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński, without using his family&#x27;s original French spelling Hoëné. At no point in his life, neither in Polish or French, was he known as Hoëné-Wroński; nor was the common French transliteration, Josef Hoëné-Wronski, ever his official name in his native Poland (though it might have served as his chosen French &quot;nom de plume&quot; on some work).

His father, Antoni Höhne (, ), was the municipal architect of Poznań. Antoni originally came from the small Bohemian village of Leukersdorf (present-day Čermná which is now a part of Libouchec). In later life, he settled in western Poland marrying Elżbieta Pernicka in Wolsztyn in 1773. In the same place and a few years later on, in 1776, their son Józef Maria was born. Józef was educated in Poznań and Warsaw. In 1794 he served in Poland&#x27;s Kościuszko Uprising as a second lieutenant of artillery, was taken prisoner, and remained until 1797 in the Russian Army. After resigning in the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1798, he studied in the Holy Roman Empire until 1800, when he enlisted in the Polish Legion at Marseille. There he began his scientific and scholarly work and conceived the idea of a great philosophical system. Ten years later he moved to Paris where he would spend most of his life working unremittingly to the last in the most difficult material circumstances.

He wrote exclusively in French, in the desire that his ideas, of whose immortality he was convinced, be accessible to all; he worked, he said, &quot;through France for Poland.&quot; He published over a hundred works, and left many more in manuscript; at 75 years of age and nearing death, he exclaimed: &quot;God Almighty, there&#x27;s still so much more I wanted to say!&quot;

In science, Hoene-Wroński set himself an extraordinary task: the complete reform of philosophy as well as that of mathematics, astronomy and technology. He elaborated not only a system of philosophy, but also applications to politics, history, economics, law, psychology, music and pedagogy. It was his aspiration to reform human knowledge in an &quot;absolute, that is, ultimate&quot; manner.

In 1803, Wroński joined the Marseille Observatory, and began developing an enormously complex theory of the structure and origin of the universe. During this period, he took up a correspondence with nearly all of the major scientists and mathematicians of his day, and was well respected at the observatory. In 1803 Wroński &quot;experienced a mystical illumination, which he regarded as the discovery of the Absolute.&quot;

In 1810, he published the results of his scientific research in a massive tome, which he advocated as a new foundation for all of science and mathematics. His theories were strongly Pythagorean, holding numbers and their properties to be the fundamental underpinning of essentially everything in the universe. His claims were met with little acceptance, and his research and theories were generally dismissed as grandiose rubbish. His earlier correspondence with major figures meant that his writings garnered more attention than a typical crackpot theory, even earning a review from the great mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange (which turned out to be categorically unfavorable). In the ensuing controversy, he was forced to leave the observatory.

He immediately turned his focus towards applying philosophy to mathematics (his critics believed that this meant dispensing with mathematical rigor in favor of generalities). In 1812, he published a paper purporting to show that every equation has an algebraic solution, directly contradicting results which had been recently published by Paolo Ruffini; Ruffini turned out to be correct.
He later turned his attention to disparate and largely unsuccessful pursuits such as a fantastical design for caterpillar-like vehicles which he intended to replace railroad transportation, but did not manage to persuade anyone to give the design serious attention. In 1819, he travelled to England in an attempt to obtain financial backing from the Board of Longitude to build a device to determine longitude at sea. After initial difficulties, he was given an opportunity to address the Board, but his pretentious address, &quot;On the Longitude&quot;, contained much philosophizing and generalities, but no concrete plans for a working device, and thus failed to gain any support from the Board. He remained for several years in England and, in 1821, published an introductory text on mathematics in London, which moderately improved his financial situation.

In 1822, he returned to France, and again took up a combination of mathematics and far-fetched ideas, despite being in poverty and scorned by intellectual society. Along with his continuing Pythagorean obsession, he spent much time working on several notoriously futile endeavors, including attempts to build a perpetual motion machine, to square the circle and to build a machine to predict the future (which he dubbed the &quot;prognometre&quot;).
In 1852, shortly before his death, he did find a willing audience for his ideas: the occultist Eliphas Levi who met Wroński and was greatly impressed and &quot;attracted by his religious and scientific utopianism.&quot; Wroński was &quot;a powerful catalyst&quot; for Levi&#x27;s occultism.

Wroński died in 1853 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, on the outskirts of Paris.

==Legacy==

During his lifetime, nearly all his work was dismissed as nonsense. However, some of it came to be regarded in a more favourable light in later years. Although most of his inflated claims were groundless, his mathematical work contains flashes of deep insight and many important intermediary results, the most significant of which was his work on series. He had strongly criticized Lagrange for his use of infinite series, introducing instead a novel series expansion for a function. His criticisms of Lagrange were for the most part unfounded but the coefficients in Wroński&#x27;s new series proved important after his death, forming a determinant now known as the Wronskian (the name which Thomas Muir had given them in 1882).

The level of Wroński&#x27;s scientific and scholarly accomplishments and the amplitude of his objectives placed Wroński in the first rank of European metaphysicians in the early 19th century. But the abstract formalism and obscurity of his thought, the difficulty of his language, his boundless self-assurance and his uncompromising judgments of others alienated him from most of the scientific community. He was perhaps the most original of the Polish metaphysicians, but others were more representative of the Polish outlook.

<doc id="302892" wikidata="Q508511" url="?curid=302892" title="Amuro Ray">
<text>is a fictional character introduced in Sunrise&#x27;s 1979 anime series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. As the first protagonist in the franchise, Amuro is a mechanic who becomes the pilot of the mecha known as RX-78-2 Gundam to protect himself from the Zeon forces invading his space colony during the war. He becomes an Earth Federation pilot in the war as well as the first Newtype, a type of human with special awareness which gives him great skills when fighting. The Gundam franchise explores Amuro&#x27;s involvement in the wars piloting the titular mecha. He returns in the sequel, &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; as an older retired soldier afraid of his past, and the 1988 feature film &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; where he takes part in new conflict against his rival Char Aznable. The character was present in several adaptations related to Gundam as well as video games.

Amuro was created by director and writer Yoshiyuki Tomino as a teenager meant to appeal to the young demography of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; with the trait of a supernatural trait known as Newtype meant to make him stronger in fights to balance his characterization. He was often written as a common man meant to contrast Char&#x27;s popularity. He is voiced by Tōru Furuya in Japanese while several actors provided their talent for the English adaptations of several Gundam works including Amuro.

Amuro&#x27;s character became very popular in Japan, earning high ranks in popularity polls involving Gundam characters as well as anime characters in general. Critical reception to the character has also been positive with comments revolving around his work as a soldier which contrasted super robot heroes and instead came across as a more realistic teenager getting used to the war.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; ===
Amuro&#x27;s first appearance is in the television series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;. Amuro is a talented amateur mechanic, who spends a lot of time in building different mechanical parts with little social interactions with other people, and as a hobby designed the basketball-sized talking robot Haro. He is the son of Tem Ray, the project leader for the Earth Federation&#x27;s Project V, which produces the prototype mobile suits Gundam, among other mechas to combat the Principality of Zeon&#x27;s Zaku. When Char Aznable sends a group of Zeon mobile suits in a reconnaissance mission on Side 7, one of the new recruits from the squad decides to attack the colony. In sheer desperation, Amuro ends up piloting the RX-78-2 Gundam to defend his home. 

Using his intuition and reading the manual, Amuro manages to start up the Gundam and defeat the two attacking Zaku mobile suits. Seeing his potential, Earth Federation Captain Bright Noa assigns the reluctant Amuro to the Gundam and repeatedly sends the boy out against Zeon forces. It is in Earth orbit that Amuro first goes into personal battle against Char. Still being a novice, Amuro fares poorly, but still manages to fend off Char&#x27;s attack. When &quot;White Base&quot; finally lands on Earth, Amuro deserts the ship after overhearing Bright discussing with Mirai Yashima about replacing Amuro from piloting the Gundam. Amuro abandons the crew with the Gundam, but after finding out about Zeon Ramba Ral&#x27;s attempted attack on &quot;White Base&quot;, he rushes back to his friends and helps resolve the situation. During the Operation Odessa, the death of Matilda Ajan causes him to realize he is not the only one affected by the war. Across his battles, Amuro gets his own nickname during the One Year War: the .

Across the war, Amuro first meets the Newtype girl Lalah Sune on the lakeside of Side 6, and immediately developed a bonding. Amuro and Char Aznable faced off several times during the course of the One Year War. He sensed Lalah&#x27;s Newtype ability when fighting Char&#x27;s Gelgoog in Side 5&#x27;s Texas Colony. Their encounter ends tragically when Amuro accidentally kills Lalah when she blocks Amuro&#x27;s critical strike towards Char with her MAN-08 Elmeth mobile armor. Amuro and Char&#x27;s feelings resulting from this culminate in the battle of A Baoa Qu where Amuro and Char destroy each other&#x27;s mobile suit through fierce fighting, and then continued fighting with side arms and eventually a sword duel. Char eventually stops fighting and Amuro reunites with his crew members.

=== &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; ===
In the sequel &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,&quot; Amuro is placed under house arrest shortly after the war due to the government&#x27;s mistrust of Newtypes. While he lives in a luxurious mansion and is officially free to come and go as he pleases, Amuro&#x27;s house servants are actually government agents assigned to keep track of his movements. Amuro works as a trainer/adviser in the Cheyenne Mobile Suit Academy up until the time of the Gryps Conflict. He suffers from chronic combat fatigue and is afraid of going to space and facing Lalah&#x27;s spirit.

During the Gryps Conflict, a pregnant Fraw Bow, with her three adopted children, come to visit Amuro. They manage to re-ignite Amuro&#x27;s fighting spirit and help him escape from his government handlers. After joining the Karaba (AEUG&#x27;s earth-bound ally), Amuro becomes a key figure within the group, leading several crucial missions, including the attack on the Titans&#x27; base in Mount Kilimanjaro and the seizing of Federation&#x27;s Congress Building in Dakar. He later goes to space to fight the Neo Zeon. After the first Neo Zeon movement, Amuro joins the Earth Federation&#x27;s Londo Bell group led by Bright Noa, and serves as the combat squad commander.

=== &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; ===
During the second Neo-Zeon movement depicted in the 1988 film &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, Amuro is assigned to the battleship &quot;Ra Cailum&quot;, Londo Bell&#x27;s flagship, as the leader of the ship&#x27;s mobile suit squads. Amuro initially pilots the RGZ-91 Re-GZ, but despite managing to hold his fight against the funnel-equipped Char and Gyunei altogether, Amuro is unable to stop Neo-Zeon dropping Luna V on the Federation&#x27;s Lhasa headquarters. Traveling to the Moon, Anaheim Electronics soon delivers to him the RX-93 Nu Gundam, a highly advanced mobile suit largely designed by Amuro himself. At Battle of Axis, after defeating Char&#x27;s MSN-04 Sazabi in the duel and capturing Char&#x27;s escape pod, Amuro attempts to single-handedly stop the asteroid from colliding with Earth by pushing it with his Nu Gundam. His action inspires other mobile suits to join in, even Neo-Zeon soldiers. Although he eventually succeeds, the act overloads Nu Gundam&#x27;s psychoframe construct, killing him along with Char.

===Other appearances===
In Yoshiyuki Tomino&#x27;s novelization of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, Amuro is already a member from the Federation in the start. In this version Amuro is killed in the final attack against the Zeonic stronghold of A Baoa Qu when his RX-78-3 is pierced through the torso by a Rick Dom&#x27;s beam bazooka. However, after his death, Amuro&#x27;s consciousness communicates with Char&#x27;s sister, Sayla Mass, and tells her she is not alone. The first version of &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, &quot;High Streamer&quot;, follows Amuro&#x27;s actions in his final fight against Char which were later adapted in the film. Tomino also wrote another novel titled &quot;Beltorchika&#x27;s Children&quot; that had Amuro as a family man and reported as killed in action in the ending. A animated film adaptation based on the &quot;Cucuruz Doan&#x27;s Island&quot; episode &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan&#x27;s Island&quot; (2022) recreates one of Amuro&#x27;s early stories from the first television series.

Amuro appears in cameo-form in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn&quot;, in the form of a photo portrait on the wall of the Captain Bright Noa&#x27;s office on board his vessel. In the final OVA for &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn&quot;, the voice of Amuro can be heard as he speaks to Char as they depart along with Lalah Sune&#x27;s spirit from the now dead body of Full Frontal. Although Amuro makes no other appearance in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn&quot;, he is referenced by several of its characters. Another episode of &quot;Gundam Evolve&quot; retcons an event from &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; where Amuro confronts Char&#x27;s underling Quess Paraya convincing her to stop fighting. He then convinces her to fly towards Hathaway Noa to save Hathaway. Amuro also appears in the manga &quot;Mobile Suit Vs. Giant God of Legend: Gigantis&#x27; Counterattack&quot; where he joins forces with Char and Judau Ashta to stop the Neo Zeon from using the massive Gigantis to cause destruction. He is also the protagonist of the manga series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin&quot; which retells the events of the first Gundam TV series with the original video animation showing his childhood. The character is also parodied in the comedy &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam-san&quot;.

Amuro is also a recurring character in the Gundam video games. He is present in the Gundam crossovers series including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gundam vs.&quot;, &quot;Dynasty Warriors: Gundam&quot; and &quot;SD Gundam&quot;. He also appears in mecha crossover series including &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; and &quot;Another Century&#x27;s Episode&quot;.

==Creation==

Yoshiyuki Tomino originally created &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot;, which was a project proposal for &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot;, was planned as a space version of &quot;Jugo Shonen Houryuuki&quot;. According to Masao Iizuka of the Japan Sunrise Planning Office Desk, who drafted the plan, Briand&#x27;s younger brother was not interesting in setting the main character because Briand, who is the leader of the same work, and Doniphan (Donovan), who is a rival, lacked interest in models. Jack, who temporarily becomes introverted, and that became the prototype of Amuro. At that time, computers were just beginning to become commonplace, and he thought that such a high-tech child would be able to do many things, so he chose a slightly introverted boy as the main character. &quot;Hongo Higashi (Azuma)&quot; in the initial draft drawn by Yasuhiko. The name Amuro Ray was invented by general director Yoshiyuki Tomino over the course of a month Later, in Tomino&#x27;s &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Setting Book / Original Draft&quot;, it was written as &quot;Amuro Rei&quot;. Yasuhiko drew the idea of &quot;let&#x27;s make it a red curly hair and make it a carrot-like character&quot;. Also, in Yoshikazu Yasuhiko&#x27;s image, Amuro was &quot;foreigner&quot; with red hair and blue eyes, but due to compromises, he is said to be a &quot;Nisei&quot; with brown hair and dark eyes.
Tomino gave the &quot;Gundam&quot; main character the name Amuro believing such word did not exist. However, three months after the show aired, Tomino received a letter from Sunrise informing him there was an island named Amuro in Okinawa. Amuro was introduced as an ordinary man in contrast to his rival Char Aznable. As a result, he found Amuro hard to write as he was meant to oppose Char whom Tomino found more interesting. In one scene of an early episode, Amuro is slapped by Bright as a method of correction. Tomino considered this scene vital as he found this type of violence needed for a young person to mature most notably due to the way Amuro was misbehaving. Shin Sasaki from Sunrise considers the final scene from the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; film trilogy where Amuro returns to White Base as one of the most memorable ones from the entire franchise. Meanwhile, Amuro has a close relationship with Fraw Bow ever since childhood and remain friendly in the White Base. Yasuhiko had problems with Tomino&#x27;s commentary about how these two characters do not end in a relationship. Instead, there is no further appeal between their relationship in &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; where Amuro instead becomes more attracted to Sayla Mass, possibly due to her being his type of woman according to the staff. Amuro was announced by Tomino as a new type of being as reflected in how society needs this new type of human being. Tomino considered Amuro &quot;kind of simple for the potential that human beings can reach in the future.&quot; Yasuhiko stated that Amuro&#x27;s misrelationship with the members of the crew of the White Base and his mother were outstanding by the time the series premiered in contrast to previous conventional heroes who would make up with each other. 

Originally, Tomino did not want to include Amuro in &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; and when trying to kill him, he failed to do it. As a result, he decided to put Amuro on a friendly relationship with Char. The relationship the two rivals have in &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; due to proper understanding between the two soldiers. In regards to &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, Tomino created the movie to end Amuro and Char&#x27;s rivalry. While the story was written to primarily centered around Char&#x27;s hypocristic ideal, Amuro would oppose them. Nevertheless, Char provides Amuro with weaponry to support his Mobile Suit so that both would fight on equal terms. The intense exchanges between both of them are compared with Tomino&#x27;s own feeling of being tired after working on several series. Tomino believes Amuro&#x27;s popularity in the film can be due to how the audience could easily empathize with the protagonist&#x27;s problems. Kawai personally wanted the film to properly depict Amuro&#x27;s mecha RX-78-02 Gundam in the same fashion as the original television series from 1978.

Original plans for &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; would involve Amuro becoming married which bothered the producers. Still, to Tomino, it seemed like the most critical opinion in planning the movie production, and he adopted it as a critical point. Tomino expressed that since Gundam was still the mecha genre, he could not make Amuro become somebody&#x27;s possession that leads to a normal life. Tomino believes je have not forgotten this principle regarding combat. As for the characters, the world of Gundam is a story of evolving humans, which inevitably leads to the &quot;denial of things&quot; and &quot;denial of machines.&quot; This is what is meant by the &quot;denial of Amuro&#x27;s marriage.&quot; 

===Casting===

He is voiced by Tōru Furuya in Japanese. Toru Furuya also liked the scene where Amuro contacts his friends using his Newtype powers. Although Amuro was not his favorite character in his career, Furuya had fun in his work as during recordings of the series, he befriended Char&#x27;s voice Actor, Shuichi Ikeda. However, he was not close to Tomino. By &quot;Char&#x27;s Conterattack&quot;, Furuya was close to his own age (35 years old) at the time of recording (29 years old), so he tried to act like an adult with a sense of responsibility. Since Amuro had not yet appeared, it was unclear how his mental state in &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; led to his resurrection in this work. It is said that until the recording of the scene involving Agi, he was dragging the youthful part of &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;. Furuya talks about Beltorchika Irma, Amuro&#x27;s partner who ended up not appearing, and although she was a necessary existence for Amuro in the days of &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot;, she is not an ideal partner, but rather Chan Agi is Amuro&#x27;s ideal. In a later interview, he said that he interpreted it as a close existence, and that such feelings subconsciously appeared in the play.

For &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan&#x27;s Island&quot; (2022), Furuya found his work nostalgic and stated that the film made emphasis of how clashing was the relationship between Amuro and his superior, Captain Bright Noa. Furuya elaborated that Yasuhiko&#x27;s idea was making the movie realistic with Amuro acting more mature in relationship with the children. Another theme of the film was how the youth&#x27;s lives are being ruined by the plot of the One Year War story from the original television series. Further commentary, Furuya was glad with the popularity he achieved by voicing Amuro for over 40 years. He said that while Amuro also had popularity, he could not surpass his rival, Char, a common trait he sometimes find common in anime where there are rivalries. He further stated that &quot;nowadays you can see the encouragement through SNS, I like how a lot of followers appear in Twitter, and I&#x27;m very surprised at his popularity&quot; 

Multiple English actors provided Amuro&#x27;s voice. Brad Swaile voiced him in the original TV series, &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, and the majority of the licensed Gundam video games. Michael Lindsay dubbed him in the three movie compilations, Matthew Erickson in &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; and the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Zeta Gundam&quot; video game. Meanwhile, for &quot;Origin&quot; Fryda Wolff provided the voice of a young Amuro while Lucien Dodge portrayed the older one.

== Reception ==
===Critical response===
Amuro Ray&#x27;s character has been well received by publications for anime and other media. John Oppliger from AnimeNation observes that the character of Amuro, to whom the young Japanese of that time could easily relate, made a major contribution to the series&#x27; popularity. While his character was early seen in the TV series as depressive and stoic, writers from Anime News Network noted how Amuro was developed in the series into a soldier as he faces the pressure of having enemies and the consequences of killing others. Additionally, J. Doyle Wallis from DVD Talk saw Amuro became more matured in the series&#x27; finale despite going through one stressing situation. However, Amuro has often been noted to be less popular than his rival Char Aznable. University of Oregon writer John D. Moore argues that &quot;Gundam&quot; foregrounds the interiority of Amuro, challenging conventions governing the young protagonist. Moore
in Gundam&#x27;s narrative strategies a sophisticated set of techniques employed to portray Amuro&#x27;s inner life. This foregrounding of Amuro&#x27;s interiority critically intervenes in the traditions of its genre and even the industrial structures that make the genre possible. The character was compared to &quot;shōnen manga&quot;-like protagonists as Amuro is the character whose interiority Gundam&#x27;s narrative is most interested in representing in contrast to previous robot series from the 1970s where the main characters where more active fighters. 

Amuro&#x27;s rivalry with Char and their subsequent final battle in the television series, the titular mobile suit stops a fatal laser beam from killing Amuro and is reduced to slag before his eyes. This final fight destroys Char&#x27;s mobile suit as well, enabling Amuro to resume battling his rival. Amuro&#x27;s ability to stand fight; and ultimately, choose not to fight, is a result of his liberation from his Gundam mobile suit; which is in turn a product of the series&#x27; focus on characters over the mecha themselves. In conclusion, according to Aaron J. Kane from University of Vermont, Tomino managed to create a realistic series by prioritizing on Amuro and Char rather than focus more on the robots like his previous works. The Netwtype powers Amuro shows across the television series were also seen as a metaphor for the protagonist&#x27;s coming-of-age ceremony as there are several episodes where Amuro starts showing signs in regards of sexuality when being attracted by Lieutenant Matilda Ajan.

His appearances in &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; were also praised by Mania Entertainment&#x27;s Chris Beveridge for adding more material from the first &quot;Gundam&quot; series and for the change in several of his relationships most notably with Char from enemy to a friendly ally. Hideaki Anno, a fellow staff member who worked with Tomino several times, describes the Amuro from &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; as a man who is ashamed of his actions in the first series and both he and Char see themselves in the new protagonist, Kamille Bidan, to the point the plot of the series came across as repetitive. Tomino responded to Anno that he aimed to give Amuro&#x27;s and Char&#x27;s characterization in &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; ambiguous but stated that Kamille is too different from them to the point of labelling the new lead as autistic as a result of his heavy burden. When Kamille&#x27;s first love is introduced, Tomino noted that they became more similar.

Allen Divers from Anime News Network found Amuro and Char&#x27;s final duel the most important part from &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, the lack of resolution of their rivalry made the film unfulfilling. In reviewing the same film, THEM Anime Reviews&#x27; Carlo Ross saw that while Amuro was overshadowed by Char, he is still an &quot;earnest, well-meaning, and heroic character in his own right.&quot; On the other hand, J. Doyle Wallis criticized their rivalry in the film considering it a &quot;rehash&quot; of the events of the television series. While initially describing Amuro as a relatable character to general view of &quot;otaku&quot;, Journal of Anime and Manga Studies said the one from &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; instead comes across as a war hero while still being popular. In &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, it is not until Amuro re engineers the RX-93 with the psycho frame system that he is able to battle Char on equal footing. This handling of Gundams was compared to that of Formula 1 drivers and their own race cars, a connection that still holds for the film. The macro-action of &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; briefly pauses whenever pilots are forced to dock mid-battle in order to attend to repairs and refueling. Such specific attention to the details of the mobile suits in the movie simultaneously be re-created in the model kits that would be released after the film&#x27;s debut. As one of the final installments from the Universal Century timeline created by Tomino, the impact of the narrative would result in several anime writers creating new characters that would attempt to recreate Amuro&#x27;s legacy alongside fans.

Anime News Network praised the movie for the focus on Amuro&#x27;s character arc and modern themes without removing the original aspects of the franchise. &quot;The Japan Times&quot; commented that every viewer would be concerned by Amuro&#x27;s safety due to how the main plot has him surviving the encounter from the original TV series but still felt returning fans would enjoy the story and how the disciplinary actions performed in White Base are contested.

===Popularity===
Amuro has been popular, having been voted as the fourth most popular male character from the 1980s by &quot;Newtype&quot; readers. He was ranked second in Mania Entertainment&#x27;s 10 Most Iconic Anime Heroes written by Thomas Zoth who commented that he &quot;was the first teenage pilot with moral qualms about the war he was fighting. His arrogance, capriciousness and self-doubt paved the way for the isolated, troubled characters of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;.&quot; In the first two &quot;Animage&quot; Readers&#x27; Poll, Anime Grand Prix, from 1979 and 1980 Amuro was voted as the second most popular character in anime and was beaten by Char. He appeared again in the Anime Grand Prix from 1989 as the sixteenth most popular male anime character. In an official Sunrise poll focused in the best team ups between former enemies, he and Char were first. In a NHK poll, he was voted as the third best &quot;Gundam&quot; character.

An EFSF military outfit was once used on a poster to encourage Japanese people to vote, and news articles refer it as the &quot;Amuro style election poster&quot;, since the actor used is a stunt actor used in place of the voice actor of Amuro Ray. Amuro was recognized as a culturally significant subject by the nation of Japan on October 23, 2000, with the inclusion of the suit and of the main pilot on two stamps in the 20th Century Stamp Series. Amuro, along with five other notable mecha and pilots from the various &quot;Gundam&quot; series, were recognized in the second set of &quot;Anime Heroes and Heroines&quot; stamps, released in Japan in 2005. In an Anime!Anime! poll, Amuro and Quattro were voted as one of the best anime rivals turned into allies. Merchandising beased on Amuro&#x27;s underwear was also released.

Anime director Goro Taniguchi was often asked if his character Suzaku Kururugi from &quot;Code Geass&quot; was inspired by Amuro as a result of several similarities such as how both pilot a white mecha and share a rivalry with a masked man; in Suzaku&#x27;s case it is Lelouch Lamperouge. Although Taniguchi denied this claims, insisting that Suzaku was instead based on Luke Skywalker from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, he still noticed there were several similarities in retrospective. When comparing these two rivalries, Taniguchi commented that while Amuro and Char became rivals in war, Suzaku and Lelouch were instead close friends before an eventual war in &quot;Code Geass&quot; where they become recurring enemies.

<doc id="302896" wikidata="Q436722" url="?curid=302896" title="Sue Lyon">
<text>Suellyn Lyon (July 10, 1946 – December 26, 2019) was an American actress who is most famous today for playing the title role in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1962 film adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s novel &quot;Lolita&quot;, for which she was awarded a Golden Globe.

Lyon&#x27;s early career flourished with appearances in such high-profile films as John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964), John Ford&#x27;s &quot;7 Women&quot; (1966), the Frank Sinatra detective film &quot;Tony Rome&quot; (1967), and the George C. Scott comedy &quot;The Flim Flam Man&quot; (1967), but her career dropped off in the 1970s and she retired from acting after making &quot;Alligator&quot;, which was released in 1980.

In 1991, Lyon featured prominently in the artwork for Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers&#x27; single &quot;Stay Beautiful&quot;.

==Early life==
Suellyn Lyon, called Sue, was born on July 10, 1946, in Davenport, Iowa. She was the youngest of five children of Sue (Karr) Lyon and her husband; her father died before her first birthday. Sue worked as a child model&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodreporter/1265070&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in Dallas. Her mother soon took the family to Los Angeles, where she thought there would be more opportunity.

==Playing Lolita==

With only two acting credits, at the age of 14, Lyon was cast in the role of Dolores &quot;Lolita&quot; Haze in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962).&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/-lolita-sue-lyon-model-actress&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She was chosen for the role from 800 teenagers. Lyon co-starred with James Mason, then aged 53. Nabokov, who wrote the novel and much of the screenplay, described her as the &quot;perfect nymphet&quot;.

Lyon got the role as the original choice, British actress Jill Haworth, was unavailable. Haworth had co-starred in Otto Preminger&#x27;s 1960 film adaptation of Leon Uris&#x27; novel &quot;Exodus&quot;, and was under contract to him. Preminger refused to allow Haworth to play Lolita. The role was then offered to child star Hayley Mills, but her father John Mills refused permission for her to do it. Hayley Mills was under contract to studio owner Walt Disney, who not only refused his permission for her to appear in the film, but told the press that he did not want her to see the finished film.
Other young actresses considered for the role were Joey Heatherton and Sandra Dee.

The film trade magazine &quot;Variety&quot; reported on August 10, 1960, that James Mason was set for the part of Humbert Humbert and that Tuesday Weld was &quot;likely&quot; to be cast in the title role. On September 28, 1960, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported the casting of Lyon.

===Lyon&#x27;s age===

Although Vladimir Nabokov originally thought that Sue Lyon was the right selection to play Lolita, years later Nabokov said that the ideal Lolita would have been Catherine Demongeot, a young French actress who had played the child Zazie in Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;Zazie in the Metro&quot; (1960). The tomboyish Demongeot was four years younger than Lyon.

In Nabokov&#x27;s novel, the character Lolita is 12 years old. Lyon was 14–15 during most of production, and a month shy of her 16th birthday when the film premiered.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair/sue-lyon-dies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/518864371&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kubrick raised the age of Lolita to dampen down the backlash from censors and pressure groups in a time when the Production Code was still in force, his &quot;Lolita&quot; was still considered one of the most controversial films of the day because of the abusive relationship at its heart.

In the opening paragraphs of the novel, Nabokov writes, &quot;She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock.&quot; The adolescent Lyon was and had a developed bust, whereas the Lolita in the novel is a flat-chested pubescent 12-year-old. Kubrick was counseled by people at the Production Code Administration that he had to cast an actress with developed breasts or he would run afoul of the Hays Code.

Producer James B. Harris explained that 14 year-old Lyon looked older than her age: &quot;We knew we must make [Lolita] a sex object [...] where everyone in the audience could understand why everyone would want to jump on her.&quot; He also said, in a 2015 &quot;Film Comment&quot; interview, &quot;We made sure when we cast her that she was a definite sex object, not something that could be interpreted as being perverted.&quot;

Harris said that he and Kubrick, through casting the older Lyon, changed Nabokov&#x27;s book as &quot;we wanted it to come off as a love story and to feel very sympathetic with Humbert.&quot;

Lyon was cast so that the relationship of the onscreen Humbert Humbert and Lolita would not look sexually perverse. Ironically, months after &quot;Lolita&quot; was released, the Hays Code was amended in October 1962 to allow &quot;sex aberrations&quot; on screen.

===Critical reaction===

Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; had its world premiere on June 13, 1962, at Loew&#x27;s State Theatre in New York City, two days after its press screening. 
&quot;Lolita&quot; was released in West Germany on June 21 and had its London premiere on September 6. It was released in France on November 5.

&quot;West Side Story&quot; was number one at the box office that week, and would be succeeded by the Cary Grant-Doris Day comedy &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; the week of June 27. In an article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on June 24, a fortnight after he had reviewed &quot;Lolita&quot;, Bosley Crowther compared it to &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot;, arguing that both films emphasized cruelty towards men.

In Crowther&#x27;s original &quot;New York Times&quot; review, he noted that the screenplay of film changed the tenor of the story, and Lyon was not the child of the book. It became a more conventional tale of an older man and younger woman. He wrote, &quot;She looks to be a good 17 years old, possessed of a striking figure and a devilishly haughty teenage air.&quot; He went on, &quot;The distinction is fine, we will grant you, but she is definitely not a &#x27;nymphet.&#x27;&quot;

Dwight McDonald, in a review in the September 1962 issue of &quot;Esquire Magazine&quot;, called the film disappointing.

Pauline Kael defended the casting of Sue Lyon in the part, noting that American girls in the early 1960s often looked much more physically mature for their age than did girls of comparable age in the past. A fan of Kubrick&#x27;s adaptation, Kael wrote, &quot;The surprise of &quot;Lolita&quot; is how enjoyable it is; it&#x27;s the first new American comedy since those great days in the 40&#x27;s when Preston Sturges recreated comedy with verbal slapstick... At times it&#x27;s so far out that you gasp as you laugh.&quot;

A contemporary review in &quot;Variety&quot; was dismissive of the production in its opening lines, &quot;Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s witty, grotesque novel is, in its film version, like a bee from which the stinger has been removed. It still buzzes with a sort of promising irreverence, but it lacks the power to shock and, eventually, makes very little point either as comedy or satire.&quot;

The &quot;Variety&quot; staff review ended with an appraisal of Lyon: &quot;Sue Lyon makes an auspicious film debut as the deceitful child-woman who&#x27;d just as soon go to a film as romp in the hay. It&#x27;s a difficult assignment and if she never quite registers as either wanton or pathetic it may be due as much to the compromises of the script as to her inexperience.&quot;

In 1962, MGM Records released a 7&quot; vinyl single recorded by Lyon, singing the lyrics &quot;Ya ya&quot; in Nelson Riddle&#x27;s &quot;Lolita Ya Ya&quot;, a send up of yé-yé singers. The B-side had her singing &quot;Turn off The Moon&quot;. Both songs were co-written by producer James B. Harris&#x27; brother, J. Robert Harris. Neither song charted.

Sue Lyon attended the 35th Academy Awards. The picture&#x27;s sole nomination was Vladimir Nabokov for Oscar for Best Screenplay Adapted From Another Medium, but he lost to Horton Foote, who adapted &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; for the screen.

===Effect on Sue Lyon&#x27;s psyche===
Sue Lyon was 15 when the film premiered in June 1962, too young to watch the film in a theater. She became an instant celebrity and won a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer—Female.

Though Lyon rarely entered the public realm after the end of her film career in the 1980s, in 1996 she made an appearance. During this she said, &quot;My destruction as a person dates from that film. &quot;Lolita&quot; exposed me to temptations no girl of that age should undergo. I defy any pretty girl who is rocketed to stardom at 14 in a sex nymphet role to stay on a level path thereafter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;grunge/485149&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to her daughter Nona Harrison, Sue Lyon suffered from bipolar disorder.

==Post-&quot;Lolita&quot; career==

In 1960, Lyon was bound to a seven-year professional services contract to Kubrick, &quot;Lolita&quot; producer James B. Harris and production company Seven Arts Productions, when she accepted the part in &quot;Lolita&quot;.

&quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964), in which she appeared opposite Richard Burton and Ava Gardner, was a Seven Arts picture. Lyon was featured on the theatrical release poster, embracing Burton. The film was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which Seven Arts had a deal with, as was &quot;7 Women&quot; (1967), in which Lyon co-starred with first-billed Oscar-winner Anne Bancroft, to whom Lyon received second-billing. Lyon also was second-billed to George C. Scott in &quot;The Flim-Flam Man&quot; (1967) and Frank Sinatra in &quot;Tony Rome&quot; (1967).

After the Kubrick-Harris-Seven Arts contract expired, she did not again appear in A-list motion pictures. She appeared in the 1969 low-budget spaghetti western &quot;Four Rode Out&quot;, top-billed over former &quot;Bonanza&quot; star Pernell Roberts, whose career was in eclipse. In 1969, she also appeared in a TV version of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; that starred Bob Crane of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; and Helen Hayes. She also made the first of her two appearances on the TV comedy &quot;Love American Style&quot; that year.

In the 1970s, her career likely was negatively impacted by an interracial marriage to African American football player Roland Harrison in 1971 and a subsequent marriage to imprisoned murderer Cotton Adamson in 1973. Racial intermarriage between white people and black people was rare in 1971, the year she co-starred with George Hamilton in &quot;Evel Knievel&quot;, a higher end B-film. State laws banning interracial marriage were not declared unconstitutional in the United States until the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1967 &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; decision.

Lyon and Harrison had a daughter, Nona Merrill Harrison, who was born in Los Angeles in 1972.

A minor hit at the box office, taking in US$4 million in rentals (equivalent to approximately $ in ) against a $450,000 budget, &quot;Evel Knievel&quot; was the last significant motion picture Lyon starred in. After her marriages to Harrison and Adamson, Lyon worked in supporting roles in B-films, television films and guest spots on TV series.

===Grade Z film star===
Towards the end of the 1970s, she began appearing in Z films, including two produced by Charles Band. In her first film for Band, &quot;Crash!&quot; (1977), Oscar-winner Jose Ferrer played her husband, who is trying to kill her. She retaliates by using her occult powers to manipulate objects to kill him.

In her second film for Band, Lyon played the wife of Christopher Lee&#x27;s astrophysicist character in the sci-fi film &quot;End of the World&quot;, which received poor reviews after it was released in 1977 as part of a double-bill with another low budget sci-fi flick. Lee later lamented his participation in the film, claiming he was misled as to the quality of the picture by producer Band.

Lyon followed this up with a part in &quot;The Astral Factor&quot;, which was also known as &quot;The Astral Fiend&quot; on its initial release in 1978. Yet another low budget sci-fi flick, the &quot;Astral&quot; film went through three directors. 
She then graced &quot;Towing&quot;, a low-budget comedy film based on newspaper columnist Mike Royko&#x27;s expose of unethical vehicle towing companies. Also known as &quot;Who Stole My Wheels?&quot; and &quot;Garage Girls&quot;, the Chicago-based film featuring one of the first appearances of actor Dennis Franz got one and one-half stars from critic Roger Ebert.

She ceased working in the entertainment industry after a bit part in the 1980 B-film &quot;Alligator&quot;. In 1984, a recut version of &quot;The Astral Factor&quot; re-titled &quot;Invisible Strangler&quot; was released, making it the last time Sue Lyon appeared in a motion picture.

==Personal life==

In California, Lyon was friends with Michelle Gilliam, who was two years older. Gilliam would achieve fame as Michelle Phillips, after marrying John Phillips and becoming part of the pop music quartet The Mamas and the Papas. According to Phillips, she shared the controversial novel &quot;Lolita&quot; with Lyon in 1960, the year before she auditioned for the part.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair/2007-12/phillips&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (In a 1962 interview with German TV as part of the film&#x27;s promotion, Lyon said she and her mother had read it and discussed the novel after she was cast in the part.)

Early in her career, starting in 1965, Lyon had a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan.

Lyon was married five times: briefly to Hampton Fancher, actor and filmmaker;&lt;ref name=&quot;smh.com.au/20200103-p53ojs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
photographer and football coach Roland Harrison, with whom she had a daughter; Gary D. &quot;Cotton&quot; Adamson, a convicted murderer; and Edward Weathers. She married Richard Rudman, an engineer, in 1985. Their marriage ended in divorce in 2002.

Her third marriage, in 1973, to Adamson, took place in a Colorado state prison, where he was incarcerated. He had been convicted of robbery and second-degree murder. The union was contentious and ended in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1974/11/15/notes-on-people&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She said at the time that people in the film industry had told her he had a negative effect on her career.

Discussing her divorce from Adamson, Lyon said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been told by people in the film business, specifically producers and film distributors, that I can&#x27;t get a job because I&#x27;m married to Cotton. Therefore, right now we can&#x27;t be married.&quot;

===Allegation of rape by producer===
In 2020, Michelle Phillips told journalist Sarah Weinman that producer James B. Harris became emotionally involved with Sue Lyon during her stay in England to shoot &quot;Lolita&quot; and that Harris had become her first lover when she was 14 years old. When contacted by Weinman, the 92-year-old Harris refused to respond to the allegation with an affirmation or denial. At the time Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; was in production, the age of consent in the UK was 16 years old and 18 in Lyon&#x27;s home state of California. Harris was nearly 18 years older than Lyon, and a married man.

==Death==
Lyon died in West Hollywood on the morning of December 26, 2019, at the age of 73. While no specific cause of death was given, she was reported to have been in poor health &quot;for some time&quot;.

&quot;To be pretty and to stay pretty are two different things. You can&#x27;t take anything for granted, and it&#x27;s foolish to think you can. You have to think ahead of how to build health and happiness. You have to learn to avoid what is going to hurt you or someone else.&quot; — Sue Lyon, 1967

<text>Houla () is a municipality in Southern Lebanon, near the border with Israel, located on the southern side of the Litani river.
The village maintains its cultural traditions to the present day, and holds village festivals. 

Houla, historically identified with Ulay Rabta, a place from rabbinic texts. The area&#x27;s antiquity is shown by discoveries of lintels and an olive-press. In the Ottoman era, Hula was a village inhabited by Shiites, described in 1881 as having stone buildings, cisterns, and a central mosque amidst olive and vineyards. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war two officers from the IDF carried out the Hula massacre in the village, killing over 80 civilians of ages 15–60. Throughout subsequent conflicts, Hula suffered from military engagements and airstrikes. 

==History==
Houla is identified with &quot;Ulay Rabta&quot; (), a place referenced in the &quot;Baraita&quot; on the &quot;Boundaries of the Land of Israel&quot; as part of the delineation of the northwestern border of Jewish resettlement following the return from Babylonian exile. Scholarly analysis suggests that this text likely describes a later era, possibly the Hasmonean or Herodian periods, during the 2nd or 1st century BCE.

The &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (1881) mentions several ancient lintels and one olive-press having been found at Hula.

===Ottoman period===
In 1875 Victor Guérin explores the geographical location of Hula and other Southern villages of Lebanon bordering Palestine, and found that Hula had 300 Shia Muslim inhabitants.

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described it as: &quot;A village, built of stone, containing about 500 Metawileh, one of the most prominent objects in which is a Sheikh&#x27;s tomb. It is situated on the hill-top, and is surrounded by olives, vines, and arable land. There are several cisterns, two &quot;birkets&quot; (one rock-cut), and a spring.&quot; It also mentions that a small central mosque is situated on top of one of the hills in the village.

===Modern era===

On October 24, 1948, the city fell in Israeli&#x27;s occupation without resistance, children and women were expelled, and men aging from 15 to 60 were gathered in a house. On 1 November, the house was blown up with the prisoners still inside. This incident is known as the Hula massacre.

Following the 1982 invasion Hula became part of the Israeli Security Zone.

On 6 April 1992 an Israeli Army convoy was ambushed in Hula. Two soldiers were killed and 5 wounded. Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, based in Sidon, claimed responsibility. The target had been Major-General Yitzhak Mordechai, head of Israel&#x27;s Northern Command. But he had left the convoy earlier. Three of the attackers were killed.

During the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, on July 15, two young women were killed by an Israeli airstrike at the village. On August 7, 2006, an Israeli airstrike on Hula killed another civilian.

During the 2023 Israel–Lebanon border clashes, the IDF conducted a drone strike that destroyed a Hezbollah anti-tank guided missile squad in Houla after they launched a missile against the nearby Israeli community of Margaliot.

On 2 June 2024, two shepherds were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in the village.

==Demographics==
In 2014 Muslims made up 99.48% of registered voters in Houla. 98.74% of the voters were Shiite Muslims.

<doc id="302899" wikidata="Q13631314" url="?curid=302899" title="No Silver Bullet">
<text>&quot;No Silver Bullet—Essence and Accident in Software Engineering&quot; is a widely discussed paper on software engineering written by Turing Award winner Fred Brooks in 1986. Brooks argues that &quot;there is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude [tenfold] improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.&quot; He also states that &quot;we cannot expect ever to see two-fold gains every two years&quot; in software development, as there is in hardware development (Moore&#x27;s law).

== Summary ==
Brooks distinguishes between two different types of complexity: accidental complexity and essential complexity. This is related to Aristotle&#x27;s classification. Accidental complexity relates to problems that engineers create and can fix. For example, modern programming languages have abstracted away the details of writing and optimizing assembly language source code and eliminated the delays caused by batch processing, though other sources of accidental complexity remain. Essential complexity is caused by the problem to be solved, and nothing can remove it; if users want a program to do 30 different things, then those 30 things are essential and the program must do those 30 different things.

Brooks claims that accidental complexity has decreased substantially, and today&#x27;s programmers spend most of their time addressing essential complexity. Brooks argues that this means shrinking all the accidental activities to zero will not give the same order-of-magnitude improvement as attempting to decrease essential complexity. While Brooks insists that there is no one silver bullet, he believes that a series of innovations attacking essential complexity could lead to significant improvements. One technology that had made significant improvement in the area of accidental complexity was the invention of high-level programming languages, such as Ada.

Brooks advocates &quot;growing&quot; software organically through incremental development. He suggests devising and implementing the main and subprograms right at the beginning, filling in the working sub-sections later. He believes that computer programming this way excites the engineers and provides a working system at every stage of development.

Brooks goes on to argue that there is a difference between &quot;good&quot; designers and &quot;great&quot; designers. He postulates that as programming is a creative process, some designers are inherently better than others. He suggests that there is as much as a tenfold difference between an ordinary designer and a great one. He then advocates treating star designers equally well as star managers, providing them not just with equal remuneration, but also all the perks of higher status: large office, staff, travel funds, etc.

The article, and Brooks&#x27;s later reflections on it, &quot;&#x27;No Silver Bullet&#x27; Refired&quot;, can be found in the anniversary edition of &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;.

== Related concepts ==
Brooks&#x27;s paper has sometimes been cited in connection with Wirth&#x27;s law, to argue that &quot;software systems grow faster in size and complexity than methods to handle complexity are invented.&quot;

<doc id="302902" wikidata="Q4943708" url="?curid=302902" title="Boontling">
<text>Boontling is a jargon or argot spoken only in Boonville, California. It was created in the 1890s. Today, it is nearly extinct, and fewer than 100 people still speak it. It has an Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) sub-tag of codice_1 (i.e. en-boont). The lingo has become somewhat infamous, at least in local circles or within the legends of California, owing to its small-town nature and curious-sounding name, as well as its very limited speakership.

The language gained attention in the 1960s and 1970s from researchers like Myrtle R. Rawles and Charles C. Adams, as well as publicity brought from Boontling-speaker Bobby (Chipmunk) Glover and historian Jack (Wee Fuzz) June.

==History and description==
Although Boontling is based on English, many of its unusual words are unique to Boonville, California. Scottish Gaelic and Irish, and some Pomoan and Spanish words also contribute to this jargon. Boontling was invented in the late 19th century and had quite a following at the turn of the 20th century. It is now mostly spoken by aging counter-culturists and native Anderson Valley residents. Because the town of Boonville has only a little more than 700 residents, Boontling is an extremely esoteric jargon, and is quickly becoming archaic. It has over a thousand unique words and phrases.

===Origins===
The Anderson Valley, of which Boonville is the largest town, was an isolated farming, ranching, and logging community during the late 19th century. There are several differing versions as to the origin of Boontling. Some assert that the jargon was created by the women, children, and young men in the hop fields and sheep-shearing sheds as a means of recreation, and that it spread through the community as the children continued using it when they grew up. Myrtle R. Rawles explains that Boontling was started by the children of Boonville as a language game which enabled them to speak freely in front of elders without being understood. It is believed that the jargon originated from Ed (Squirrel) Clement and Lank McGimsey, circa 1890.

===Documentation===
Based on interviews of family and neighbors, Myrtle Rawles wrote an article, &quot;&#x27;Boontling&#x27;: Esoteric Speech of Boonville, California,&quot; published in 1966 by the California Folklore Society (presently Western States Folklore Society) in &quot;Western Folklore&quot;, Volume 25, No. 2, and reprinted under the title &quot;Boontling, or the strange Boonville language&quot; by the Mendocino County Historical Society in 1967. Researcher Charles C. Adams studied the lingo in the 1960s and wrote a doctoral dissertation based on his research. In 1971 University of Texas Press published his book, &quot;Boontling: an American Lingo&quot;, which included an extensive dictionary.

Boontling briefly enjoyed a national audience in the mid-1970s when a Boontling speaker named Bobby (Chipmunk) Glover was a regular guest on the well-known &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on the NBC television network. Boontling historian Jack (Wee Fuzz) June appeared on the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. Because Boontling is a spoken jargon rather than a written one, spellings of its words vary greatly. Most spellings were not formalized until the 1970s, primarily by the writings of Jack (Wee Fuzz) June.

<text>The Blaster Learning System is an educational video game series created by Davidson &amp; Associates and later published by JumpStart (formerly Knowledge Adventure) after the two companies were acquired and merged by CUC Software. The games primarily focused on mathematics, later expanding into language arts and science, and spawned an animated children&#x27;s television series in 1999 called &quot;Blaster&#x27;s Universe&quot;.

Starting in 2011, development of the series focused on an online version of &quot;Math Blaster&quot; played through a browser or mobile app rather than standalone game software. JumpStart Games ended the support for &quot;Math Blaster&quot; and was closed in July 2023.

== History ==
=== Davidson ===
The series began with the 1983 title &quot;Math Blaster!&quot; released for the Apple II and Atari 8-bit computers. The initial game was ported to other platforms and received gradual improvements to graphics and sound, with &quot;Plus&quot; added to the title in 1987 and &quot;New&quot; in 1990. The initial release was a collection of four unrelated activities with a space theme, with later versions connecting the activities with a simple narrative and introducing the character Blasternaut.

Spin-offs intended for older children included &quot;Alge-Blaster!&quot; in 1985 and &quot;Math Blaster Mystery&quot; in 1989. These titles, along with their 1990s remakes and sequels, would not follow the Blasternaut character but would still be marketed by Davidson as part of the Blaster series.

The first reboot of the Davidson fundamentals line came in 1989. The original &quot;Math Blaster&quot; was written in Applesoft Basic and the Microsoft equivalent. Under the direction of Mike Albanese, the Davidson programming team used Fig Forth to make a cross-platform development system; it was the first of many Forth-based products that Davidson would make.

The 1993 release &quot;Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot&quot; was the first in the series to feature a storyline told through animated cutscenes and voice acting. The version of Blasternaut seen in this game, as well as his robot companion Spot and supervisor Galactic Commander (GC), would become recurring characters seen in the 1994 sequels &quot;Reading Blaster: Invasion of the Word Snatchers&quot; and &quot;Math Blaster Episode II: Secret of the Lost City&quot;.

A redesign of the characters was introduced in the 1996 title &quot;Mega Math Blaster&quot; (later rebranded &quot;Math Blaster: Ages 6–9&quot;), which served as a remake of the activities from Episode I with a new storyline, although references to the previous games in the series implied a shared continuity. This redesign would carry over into &quot;Reading Blaster 2000&quot; (also rebranded &quot;Reading Blaster: Ages 6–9&quot;), the Episode II remake &quot;Math Blaster: Ages 9–12&quot;, and three &quot;Junior&quot; prequels for children ages 4-6 focused on math, reading, and science.

=== Knowledge Adventure ===

The characters were redesigned again in 1999, coinciding with the CBS Saturday morning cartoon &quot;Blaster&#x27;s Universe&quot; animated by the Canadian studio Nelvana. The Blasternaut and GC characters were altered to be 12-year-old earthlings and Spot was replaced with a robot dog named MEL (&quot;Mechanically Enhanced Lapdog&quot;). The changes also coincided with Knowledge Adventure&#x27;s rebranding of the full series and switch to identifying games by grade levels instead of age ranges. This would be the last time games in the &quot;Reading Blaster&quot; sub-series were released.

&quot;Math Blaster: Master the Basics&quot; was released in 2006, featuring another redesign of the Blasternaut character, comic book styled cutscenes, and 3D graphics in-game. This version of the character would also appear in the 2008 Nintendo DS title &quot;Math Blaster in the Prime Adventure&quot;.

Starting in 2011, development of the series focused on an online version of &quot;Math Blaster&quot; played through a browser or mobile app rather than standalone game software. JumpStart Games ended support for &quot;Math Blaster&quot; and was closed in July 2023.

==Reception==
The original game was praised by &quot;InfoWorld&quot; for its high resolution graphics, and considered it a standout title in the drill-and-practice edutainment video game genre. &quot;II Computing&quot; listed &quot;Math Blaster&quot; second on the magazine&#x27;s list of top Apple II education software as of late 1985, based on sales and market-share data.

&quot;New Math Blaster Plus&quot; was reviewed in the &quot;Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Guide Book&quot; where it was praised for its &quot;arcade-quality graphics [making] drills snappy and entertaining&quot;.

&quot;Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot&quot; was rated as one of the top 100 CD-ROM games of 1994 in &quot;PC Magazine&quot;.

&quot;Math Blaster Mystery: The Great Brain Robbery&quot; was given a 4 out of 4 star rating by the &quot;Home PC&quot; magazine adding that &quot;most games aren&#x27;t educational AND fun, but &quot;Math Blaster Mystery&quot; is both&quot;.

By June 1997, the series sold 5 million copies.

After starting off with a huge boom and providing the base for the establishment of a successful public corporation, the &quot;Blaster&quot; series eventually fell victim to marketing cuts. In an attempt to sell both up and down the age group added more, &quot;Blasters&quot; were designed with increasingly thin, fuzzy and overlapping target age groups. Finally, the line came under fierce attack from the Gross brothers of Knowledge Adventure (now JumpStart), led by Barton Listic. Knowledge Adventure countered with a simple grade-based sub-division with their &quot;JumpStart&quot; logo. Eventually, Knowledge Adventure and Davidson were acquired by CUC International to form CUC Software, and the company lines were merged.

<doc id="302912" wikidata="Q936969" url="?curid=302912" title="Nanny">
<text>A nanny is a person who provides child care. Typically, this care is given within the children&#x27;s family setting. Throughout history, nannies were usually servants in large households and reported directly to the lady of the house. Today, modern nannies, like other domestic workers, may live in or out of the house, depending on their circumstances and those of their employers. Some employment agencies specialize in providing nannies, as there are families that specifically seek them and may make them a part of the household.

Nannies differ slightly from other child care providers. A childminder works out of their own home, operating as a small business. In America, childminders are often advertised as a daycare. Depending on the country the childminder or daycare is in, government registration may or may not be required. Within the UK, a childminder must be Ofsted-registered, hold a current paediatric first aid qualification, public liability insurance and follow the EYFS. A mother&#x27;s helper is someone who may live in or out of the household, and assists the person of the house with general chores as well as caring for the children. The term &quot;au pair&quot; usually refers to a young person, who comes from abroad to live with the host family and learn the local culture and language, while helping care for the children. A governess concentrates on educating children inside their own home, and a kindergarten or schoolteacher does the same, but in a school environment.

Even though there are no legal requirements to be considered a nanny, families may require a background check and a CPR certification. Families may also look for other special skills in a nanny, such as being bilingual or having early childhood development coursework done. Nannies help play a key role in a child&#x27;s development by providing care.

==History==
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, a nanny was usually known as a &quot;nurse&quot;, and was typically female. &quot;Nurses&quot; were found in higher-income homes, and &quot;nurses&quot; were either hired or were slaves. Originally, the hired person would have been expected to breastfeed the infant, a role known as a &quot;wet nurse&quot;. In some households, the nurse was a senior member of the household staff and ran her own domain, a suite of rooms called the nursery. Some were supported by at least one assistant, known as a nursemaid (or nurserymaid). Because of their deep involvement in raising the children of the family, nannies were often remembered with great affection and treated more kindly than the junior servants.

Nannies were often present in the households of the colonial officials tasked with managing vast colonial empires. Nannies in colonial societies spent their lives in the homes of their masters, often from childhood till old age, taking care of more than one generation (depending on the duration of the post). It was not uncommon for these nannies to be brought along with the family when these colonial officials were posted either back to Europe or to another colony.

* In Colonial India, a nanny was known as &quot;ayah&quot;, after , nurse, governess . This term is presently part of the vocabulary of various languages of the Subcontinent, meaning also female servant or maid.
* In Chinese she was an .
* In the Dutch East Indies the household nanny was known as .

==Types==
===Live-in nanny===
A &quot;live-in&quot; nanny is much less common than it once was. Being a live-in nanny may be ideal for a person looking to move interstate or abroad for either a short period of time or to set themselves up financially. Typically, a live-in nanny is responsible for the entire care of the children of their employers. This includes anything from washing the children&#x27;s clothes, tidying the children&#x27;s rooms, supervising homework, preparing children&#x27;s meals, taking children to and from school, and taking children to after-school sports and/or activities. Employee benefits may include a separate apartment (sometimes called a &quot;nanny flat&quot;) or room, and possibly a car. While a live-in nanny was commonly available 24 hours a day in the past, this is much less common now and often these nannies work 10–12 hours on and the remainder of the day off. Essentially, these nannies are working while the children are awake and the parents are at work. A live-in nanny is nowadays more common among wealthier families because live-in nannies often have all their living expenses paid and provided by the employer.

===Nanny share===

Some families use what is known as a &#x27;nanny share&#x27;, where two or more families pay for the same nanny to care for the children in each family on a part-time basis.

===Night nanny===
A more recent addition to the role of a nanny is that of a night nanny. The night nanny usually works with a family anywhere from one night to seven nights per week. A night nanny generally works with children from newborn to five years of age. A night nanny can provide a teaching role, helping parents to establish good sleeping patterns or troubleshooting the sleeping patterns of a child. Roles and qualifications vary between countries. The night nanny works together with the family&#x27;s requirements and philosophies. The qualifications of a night nanny are usually in mothercraft nursing (see sleep guidance specialist or early childhood development). Pay rates vary from country to country, but night nannies are usually well paid in comparison to the general nanny, as the night nanny is seen as a specialist or expert in their field.

===Maternity nurse / newborn care specialists / confinement nanny===

Historically, European women were confined to their beds or their homes for extended periods of time after giving birth. Care was provided either by her female relatives (mother or mother-in-law) or by a temporary attendant known as a monthly nurse. These weeks were called confinement or lying-in, and ended with the re-introduction of the mother to the community in the Christian ceremony of the churching of women. A modern version of this rest period has evolved with intentions to give maximum support to the new mother, especially if she is recovering from a difficult labor and delivery.

In the US these specialty maternity nannies are known as newborn care specialists (disassociating this specialty from medically qualified nursing). They are highly experienced in all aspects of newborns, aside from medical issues. They may work 24 hours a day, seven days per week, but most commonly work five nights/days a week for the first three months of a newborn&#x27;s life. The role can consist of assisting parents with feeding guidance, nursery set up, premature infant, multiples, colic, reflux, and sleep guidance/training. There are various training organizations that offer non-accredited certifications, however, in an unregulated field parents should ensure that the qualifications of their maternity nanny are legitimate and accredited. The Newborn Care Specialist Association is one of many self-appointed certification entities. Some doulas specialize in postpartum care for mother and baby. Another related job is perinatal assistant.

Chinese and related East Asian traditions practice a form of postpartum confinement known in Chinese-speaking regions as &quot;zuo yue zi&quot; &quot;sitting the month&quot;, which are traditions and customs regarding recovery from childbirth. The &quot;confinement ladies&quot; are referred to as yue sao, and they have specialized knowledge of how to care for both baby and mother. In Singapore and Malaysia, newborn care specialists are better known as confinement nannies. They assist the mother in taking care of the baby in order to let the mother have a good rest. Confinement food will be prepared to help with the recovery. Usually, the employment period will be about 28 days up to a maximum of 16 weeks. In Korea these postpartum care workers are called Sanhujorisa.

In the Netherlands, standard postnatal care, supported by state medical insurance, includes more than a week of all-day visits called &quot;kraamzorg&quot;. This kraamverzorgster (&quot;maternity home care assistant&quot;) teaches the new mother how to care for her baby, measures both of their health, prepares light meals, entertains older children, performs light household tasks, cleans the home and disinfects the bathroom. They help care for the mother, baby, and family.

==Demographic==
Typically, women from their 20s to 60s take up employment as nannies. Some are younger, though normally younger workers are nursemaids or au pairs rather than nannies in the traditional use of the term.

A few positions are filled by men; the term &quot;manny&quot; is sometimes used for a male nanny, especially in the US and UK.

==Qualifications==
In the United States, and in the United Kingdom no formal qualifications are required to be a nanny. However, some parents prefer or sometimes require their nanny to have a CPR and/or first aid certification. In the United States, nanny training and certifications are increasing as the US Nanny Association has published national standards and issues certifications for Professional Nannies, Newborn and Infant Professionals and Certified Nannies. Many Nannies have childhood education credits or degrees, though these are usually not required.

<doc id="302913" wikidata="Q94620" url="?curid=302913" title="Information Society (band)">
<text>Information Society (also known as InSoc) is an American electronic band from Minneapolis–St. Paul, Minnesota, initially active from 1982 to 1997, primarily consisting of Paul Robb, James Cassidy and Kurt Harland Larson; the former two reconvened the band in 2006, initially with Christopher Anton as lead vocalist, then with Harland rejoining them as lead vocalist by 2008.

The group&#x27;s breakout single was 1988&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s on Your Mind (Pure Energy)&quot;, a dance song which spent 39 weeks on the dance chart, going straight to number one and also peaking at number three on the Hot 100 pop chart. The track included a vocal sample of Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) from &quot;Star Trek&quot;, saying &quot;pure energy&quot;.

The band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.

==History==
===Founding, influences, and initial albums (1982–1992)===

The band was formed in Harland&#x27;s dormitory room in Dupre Hall at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1982, and they performed avant-garde electronic music with flourishes of hip hop, dub, and electro. The name was chosen partly after Ingsoc, the newspeak term for English socialism in George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. The group were initially influenced by acts such as Kraftwerk, Gary Numan and Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft (D.A.F.), thereafter developing an admiration for the likes of Pet Shop Boys, Duran Duran and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). In 1983, the band independently released &quot;The InSoc EP&quot; and &quot;Creatures of Influence&quot;.

Two years later it released &quot;Running&quot;, the group&#x27;s first single, which became a hit popular in New York City Latin dance clubs and put them on the map. The extended seven-minute song was written and sung by Murat Konar, who left the band soon afterward. It was released on the Twin Cities-based label Twin-Tone Records, which was known for rock music rather than dance music. Its growing success led the group to move from its native Minneapolis–Saint Paul to New York City, and the ensuing revenues and contacts, as well as the addition of keyboardist Amanda Kramer to the lineup, led the group to record its proper debut album for Tommy Boy Records, which bought out the group&#x27;s Twin-Tone contract because of its expertise in street-oriented music.

InSoc was the only Tommy Boy act to have all of its albums released through major-label distribution channels rather than independent distribution, since the label, a former subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records, had that option available to it throughout its years as a Warner subsidiary. In this case, Warner sub-label Reprise Records was the distributor. The group&#x27;s 12-inch vinyl singles, however, were distributed through independent channels.

In addition to &quot;What&#x27;s on Your Mind (Pure Energy)&quot;, the group&#x27;s self-titled major release debut &quot;Information Society&quot; (1988) also produced another Top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; entry in &quot;Walking Away&quot; which reached number five on the dance chart and number nine on the Hot 100 chart. Kramer left the band shortly after. A third single, the ballad &quot;Repetition&quot; managed to reach number 76 on the Hot 100 also. The fourth single from the album was a cover of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Lay All Your Love on Me&quot; which reached number 23 on the dance chart and number 83 on the Hot 100.

The audio samples from &quot;Star Trek&quot; were authorized for use on the album partially thanks to the efforts of Adam Nimoy, a fan of the band and son of &quot;Star Trek&#x27;s&quot; Leonard Nimoy. The album sold out its initial pressing in the United States in two weeks. &quot;Information Society&quot; peaked at number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified gold within five months of its release in the US. The disc was one of the few to use CD+G, which included digital graphics on the compact disc version in addition to the music. The graphics for the CD+G portion can be seen on the Information Society Web site along with computer-based information which has been included on other releases. The songs &quot;What&#x27;s On Your Mind (Pure Energy)&quot; and &quot;Walking Away&quot; were used in a sampler disc bundled with the Sega CD to showcase the console&#x27;s CD+G capability, using the same graphics as the album.

During this time the band released an anonymous single (composed of two tracks from their forthcoming second album) under the name Think Tank. Years later, Robb would release tracks under the name Think Tank through the formerly-fictional record label Hakatak.

Their song, the instrumental track &quot;Hit Me&quot;, was placed on the soundtrack to the science-fiction comedy film &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;. By 1989, Information Society joined the &quot;Club MTV Tour&quot; which also included Paula Abdul, Milli Vanilli, Tone Loc, Was (Not Was) and Lisa Lisa.

The second release, &quot;Hack&quot; (1990), was not as successful, but had a top 40 entry with &quot;Think&quot;, which also went to number five on the Dance Club/Play Songs list. &quot;How Long&quot; went to number 20 on the Dance Club/Play Songs list. The album managed to sell quite well in late 1990, staying on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for 14 weeks, peaking at number 77. Music videos were produced for those two tracks, but only &quot;Think&quot; got video airplay; the Adam Ant-directed spot for &quot;How Long&quot; was put aside as nobody involved was happy with it. A third single, &quot;Now That I Have You&quot;, was remixed and sent out to DJs but was never released. In January 1991 the band performed at the Rock In Rio II festival in front of 190,000 fans at the Maracanã Stadium.

The group&#x27;s third release, &quot;Peace and Love, Inc.&quot; (1992), proved to be more powerful and critically acclaimed, although its label failed to do much to promote it despite featuring production by Karl Bartos of German electronic music band Kraftwerk. The first single, &quot;Peace &amp; Love Inc.&quot;, reached number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Chart. A music video was produced for the track, but MTV declined to play it. The album is also notable for being perhaps the first album ever produced to contain a track of modem tones, which, when played into a telephone connected to a computer, resulted in a bonus message from the band. To promote the album, Information Society embarked on a club tour in fall 1992 with Cause and Effect, but the tour was canceled when Cause and Effect frontman Sean Rowley died of complications from an asthma attack during their soundcheck in Minneapolis on November 8, 1992.

===&quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot; and Cleopatra Records (1992–1999)===
In 1997 the band released a fourth album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot; (1997). Written and performed by Kurt Harland alone and produced by Steven Seibold, DBA was more industrial-driven than previous albums and reflected more of what Harland wanted to do during most of his tenure with InSoc. Cleopatra Records released the album, but — like Tommy Boy Records — did little to promote it. Harland&#x27;s love of computer-related materials continued to be evident, as the album included a CD-ROM filled with bonus material, not yet a common occurrence in 1997. The disc included a selection of digital samples used in the album&#x27;s production, miscellaneous works of art by InSoc fans, a program to generate the distinctive border graphics used on the album&#x27;s cover, and the music video of &quot;Peace &amp; Love, Inc.&quot;

There was also a carefully orchestrated digital scavenger hunt culminating in the discovery of a bonus track, &quot;White Roses&quot;. The scavenger hunt began with decoding a modem&#x27;s signal recorded at the end of the audio CD, resulting in a text message from Harland which pointed the way to a Web site where the search began. There is also a cover included of Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot;. Also included is &quot;Ozar Midrashim&quot;, later used as the main theme for the videogame &quot;Soul Reaver&quot;. The album eventually went out of print, but it had a second release in a remastered version in 2008, this time with &quot;White Roses&quot; included as an audio track.

A remix album, &quot;InSoc Recombinant&quot; (1999), was produced, featuring vocals to the band&#x27;s earlier hits remixed by various artists. The vocals to songs pre-&quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot; were not the originals, they were new versions re-recorded by Harland alone specifically for the remixers&#x27; use. Included on a bonus, unadvertised CD-ROM were digital copies of most of the band&#x27;s officially-produced promotional videos, including a copy of the &quot;Peace and Love Inc.&quot; video of higher quality than that distributed with &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid.&quot; This CD-ROM, however, did not feature the &quot;How Long&quot; video.

===Compilations and &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; (1999–2005)===
In 2001, &quot;strange haircuts // cardboard guitars // and computer samples&quot; was released including all the hits from 1988 to 1992.

In 2004, Cleopatra Records released a compilation, &quot;Pure Energy&quot;. The release consisted of tracks from &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot; and &quot;InSoc Recombinant,&quot; supplemented with a slightly altered mix of &quot;Are Friends Electric?&quot; and two new remixes of &quot;What&#x27;s On Your Mind&quot;, one by Effcee, and one unattributed mix labeled &quot;What&#x27;s On Your Mind (Pure Energy)&quot; which attempted to emulate the original Tommy Boy version of the track. Robb called the album &quot;an insult to both the band and the fans&quot;. Harland, despite being credited as producer in the liner notes, had nothing to do with the release; and while declining to either &quot;endorse or un-endorse&quot; the album, he did take particular issue with the cover art, both for its low quality and for its portrayal of him holding a gun.

The group was featured in an episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; in November 2004. As broadcast, it appeared that Aamer Haleem (host of the show) got every member to agree to reuniting. However, Kurt had declined to appear in the planned concert, for reasons he later detailed in a post on the band&#x27;s official website. The post also details his experiences behind the scenes of the production, and how they differ from the portrayals in the episode as broadcast.

The VH1 show was followed by a period of relative quiet, although Harland, Cassidy, and Robb gave two performances at a weekend music festival in New York City on August 20–21, 2005.

===&quot;Oscillator&quot;, &quot;Synthesizer&quot;, and &quot;Modulator&quot; releases (2005–2009)===
In 2006, it was announced that Paul Robb and James Cassidy had decided to reconvene Information Society without Kurt Harland&#x27;s full participation in the recording process. From Kurt: Harland&#x27;s absence in the studio line-up was cited as being due to family and work obligations. Harland ultimately contributed lead vocals to one track, &quot;Seeds of Pain&quot;.

The new lineup included Christopher Anton as lead vocalist on &quot;Oscillator&quot; and &quot;Synthesizer&quot; and co-wrote several tracks on each including the title track of the latter. They were also joined by Sonja Myers who played additional keyboards and provided a return to female background vocals.

Christopher Anton performed live as the lead singer for Information Society throughout 2006–2008, including shows in California, Oregon, New York, New Jersey, and São Paulo, Brazil. By mid-2007, the band began to return to its original lineup of Harland, Cassidy, and Robb, who performed on July 21, 2007, at the Freestyle Reunion 2 Concert at Madison Square Garden. After the release of &quot;Synthesizer&quot;, the trio performed a series of concerts in Philadelphia, Seattle, San Francisco and Austin, Texas. The concert in Philadelphia was filmed for a forthcoming DVD.

On 19 March 2007, Information Society self-released an EP, &quot;Oscillator&quot;, first as an Internet-only release – their first commercial release in over six years. This EP was later released in CD format with an extra audio track and a bonus CD-ROM video track. It includes remixes by the Brazilian duo Kain &amp; Arvy for &quot;I Like The Way You Werk It&quot; (only on CD version) and &quot;Back In The Day&quot; (on both releases). This was followed by the album &quot;Synthesizer&quot; which was released on October 9 in North America and October 5 in Europe on Dancing Ferret Discs. The album was released digitally in North America and Europe on September 4, 2007. Several live shows in the US followed the album&#x27;s release.

Information Society commissioned chiptune/micromusic artist 8 Bit Weapon to remix &quot;I Like the Way You Werk It&quot;. 8 Bit Weapon remixed the song using both a Commodore 64 computer and a Game Boy Classic handheld console. The remix was titled &quot;I Like the Way You Werk It – 8 Bit Weapon Remix&quot;. &quot;I Like the Way You Werk It&quot; was also remixed by LA-based indie promoter and electronica artist Jon Hershfield. The remix is titled &quot;Werk It V.2.&quot; Both Robb and Anton have been guests on Hershfield&#x27;s internet radio program Isgoodmusic.com.

&quot;Modulator&quot;, an EP of remixes from &quot;Synthesizer&quot;, was released in digital-only format in September 2009. It was also included in its entirety on the &quot;25 Years of Information Society&quot; DVD released later that year. Notable remixers on the &quot;Modulator&quot; EP included Dave Aude and Tommie Sunshine. &quot;Modulator&quot; also included a live version of &quot;Wrongful Death&quot; and a brand new song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch The Devil&quot; with Kurt on vocals.

===Reformation of classic lineup and subsequent material (2009–present)===
In September 2014, Information Society released their first album of new material featuring the old Harland/Cassidy/Robb line-up since 1992, &quot;Hello World&quot;. Robb and Harland worked on this album throughout 2013 and the first half of 2014, as well as another project, still unannounced as of October 1, 2014. This album, with Harland back at Lead vocals, brings the band closer to its classic sound, yet with a modern edge. Much like the Easter egg on the last track on &quot;Peace and Love, Inc.,&quot; this album also has a secret track, when rendered using a spectrogram provides a URL and login credentials (now defunct) to 3 bonus tracks.

Information Society released the aforementioned project, &quot;Orders of Magnitude&quot; on March 11, 2016, again featuring the old Harland/Cassidy/Robb line-up. The album features numerous covers, including &quot;Dominion&quot; by The Sisters of Mercy, &quot;Beautiful World&quot; by Devo (Featuring Gerald V. Casale on vocals), and &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; by Human League. Other Guest artists include Vitamin C, Ayria, and Leila Mack.

The single &quot;Nothing Prevails&quot; was released on the Tommy Boy Records label on June 29, 2018. Two versions were made available: one with vocals in English, and one with vocals in German. A video was also released, featuring mostly still art but with some slight animation. The singles &quot;World Enough&quot; and &quot;Bennington&quot; were released on the Tommy Boy Records label on January 11 and May 17, 2019 respectively.

In August 2021 the band released &quot;ODDfellows&quot;, their eighth album, in both a standard mix and in THX Spatial Audio, optimized for headphones.

===Side projects===
Information Society&#x27;s members Kurt Harland and Murat Konar&#x27;s brother Mithat collaborated under the name A.K.A. They recorded two songs (&quot;Cruel Lovin&#x27;&quot; sung by Mithat, and &quot;All You Ever Told Were Lies&quot; sung by Harland) that were produced by Harland.
