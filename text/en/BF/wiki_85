<text>Lisa Marie Varon (née Sole; born February 10, 1971) is an American retired professional wrestler, fitness competitor and bodybuilder. She is signed to WWE under a Legends contract, under the ring name Victoria. She is also known for her tenure in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, under the ring name Tara. Varon held both companies women&#x27;s championships on many occasions.

Varon began competing in fitness competitions and won ESPN2&#x27;s &quot;Fitness America Series&quot; in 1997. In 1999, she placed second at a fitness event in New York City to earn her International Federation of BodyBuilders (IFBB) Professional Fitness Card. Varon met World Wrestling Federation (WWF) performer Chyna, who encouraged her to become a professional wrestler. She trained in the WWF&#x27;s developmental territories for three years before moving to the main roster to compete full-time under the ring name Victoria.

Varon had her first television appearance at WrestleMania 2000, where she portrayed one of The Godfather&#x27;s &quot;Hos&quot;. She debuted in June 2002 and was pushed to win the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship, a title she would go on to hold twice in her wrestling career. After leaving WWE in 2009, Varon debuted in TNA later that year as Tara. In TNA, she became a five-time TNA Knockouts Champion, making her a seven-time Women&#x27;s Champion overall. She was also a one-time TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champion, with Brooke Tessmacher, collectively known as TnT.

== Early life ==
Varon was born in San Bernardino, California, to a Puerto Rican father (who is a Vietnam veteran) and a Korean-born Turkish mother who worked as a singer in Japan. She grew up with three older brothers, all of whom became amateur wrestlers, with her oldest brother, Bobby, winning a gold medal at the 1983 Pan American Games. Varon attended Eisenhower High School in Rialto, California. During high school, she was active in cheerleading, a sport in which she competed since the sixth grade.

During her senior year in high school, she was nationally recognized by the National Cheerleading Association, earning an All-American award and being chosen to cheer at half-time of the NFL 1989 Pro Bowl, alongside 70 other women. She participated in track and field events in the ninth grade. After graduating, she studied biology at the University of California, Los Angeles and she studied medicine at Loma Linda University, with the intent on becoming a physician. She worked as a human tissue coordinator at the Inland Eye and Tissue Bank in Redlands, California, where she was involved in the process of organ donation.

== Bodybuilding and fitness career ==
While working at the eye and tissue bank, Varon became a personal trainer and taught aerobics. While training at a gym, she was offered an opportunity to compete in a bodybuilding competition, a contest she won as a middleweight. She competed in fitness competitions, such as ESPN2&#x27;s &quot;Fitness America Series&quot; in 1997 and 1998, winning the former, and the Miss Galaxy Competition in 1998, where she met and befriended Torrie Wilson. After Wilson moved to Los Angeles, California and signed with the professional wrestling promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW), she invited Varon to one of the shows. While backstage, an agent asked her to appear in a segment with Scott Hall. Through Wilson, Varon unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a contract with WCW. She later moved to Los Angeles to find work in televised news fitness segments. In 1999, she earned her International Federation of BodyBuilders (IFBB) Professional Fitness Card after placing second at the National Physique Committee (NPC) Team Universe show in New York City. It was during her time working in fitness competitions that Varon also first met Trish Stratus.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2000-2009) ===

==== Training and debut (2000–2001) ====
After moving to Los Angeles, Varon worked as a trainer at the gym Crunch Fitness, where she met World Wrestling Federation wrestler Chyna, who complimented Varon on her appearance and encouraged her to become a wrestler. Varon would then put together a biography package and sent it to the WWF. She heard from Kevin Kelly two days later, who invited her to an interview in a month&#x27;s time. With no previous wrestling experience, she looked up professional wrestling schools, and eventually began training at Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW) in Southern California in June 2000. She wrestled under the ring name Head Bitch In Charge (HBIC), and appeared in a cheerleading outfit, with a snooty gimmick, similar to WCW Nitro Girl Miss Hancock. She impressed WWF talent scout Bruce Prichard during her first UPW show.

Varon made her on-screen debut in the WWF portraying one of The Godfather&#x27;s &quot;hos&quot;. She was referred to as the &quot;head ho&quot;, and led the &quot;Save the Hos&quot; campaign. On the August 7 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Varon took a bump by being powerbombed through a table by The Godfather&#x27;s next persona, The Goodfather. After this, she was given the name Victoria. She was removed from television in November, and sent to WWF&#x27;s then-developmental territory Power Pro Wrestling in Memphis for extensive training. In February 2001, she was aligned with Brandon Baxter and Bobby Eaton in a feud with Bill Dundee, Jerry Lawler and The Kat. Throughout the feud, Victoria and Baxter were manipulating Eaton into fighting with Dundee, going so far as blurring fact and fiction by mixing professional and personal lives, including having Bobby&#x27;s son Dylan call on the phone and a kayfabe wedding between Victoria and Eaton. Unfortunately, the feud didn&#x27;t have a proper end, as in March 2001, the WWF severed ties with Power Pro over Jerry Lawler&#x27;s quitting the promotion over the Kat&#x27;s firing in late February. Power Pro folded shortly thereafter.

After Power Pro folded, she quickly joined Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW). Victoria briefly acted as the commissioner for MCW, and was involved in storyline feud with Ivory. She also managed Steve Bradley before MCW closed in 2001. Varon later relocated to Louisville, Kentucky to train in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), using the ring name Queen Victoria. She was placed as the manager of the tag team the Basham Brothers, and managed one of the team members, Doug Basham, to win the OVW Heavyweight Championship on July 25, 2001.

Victoria lost to Lita (wrestler) at the Brian Pillman Memorial Show on August 4, 2001 as part of Heartland Wrestling Association. She worked for Heartland until early 2002.

==== Women&#x27;s Championship reigns (2002–2004) ====
Varon returned to the renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as Victoria on the July 7, 2002 episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, in an angle with Trish Stratus, who Victoria claimed had betrayed her when they worked together as fitness models. The storyline had her character become a demented, sadistic villainess, as she and Stratus feuded for months. Her first pay-per-view match came at No Mercy, where she was defeated by Stratus. The following month at Survivor Series, Victoria defeated Stratus with a Snap Suplex in a hardcore match, to win the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship for the first time. Victoria would go on to successfully retain her championship against Stacy Keibler, with the debut of her finishing move, the &quot;Widows Peak&quot;. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Victoria was attacked in the ring by Stratus. Steven Richards came to her aid, establishing an on-screen relationship between Victoria and Richards. At Armageddon, Victoria began using the entrance theme &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; by t.A.T.u. She defeated Stratus and Jacqueline to retain the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship in a triple threat match.

Victoria continued to feud with Trish Stratus into 2003, competing against her in successful title defenses and mixed tag team matches, during which Victoria teamed with Richards. At WrestleMania XIX, Victoria dropped the Women&#x27;s Championship back to Stratus during a Triple Threat match that also involved Jazz. She also faced wrestling legend and WWE Hall of Famer The Fabulous Moolah on September 15, 2003, in a losing effort. Throughout the rest of the year, Victoria was involved in matches against other Divas, such as participating in a Fatal Four-Way match for the Women&#x27;s Championship at Judgment Day, and defeating Lita in the first women&#x27;s steel cage match in WWE history on November 24. Victoria also defeated Ivory in a number one contender&#x27;s match for the Women&#x27;s Championship on the last episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; of 2003. After the match, Women&#x27;s Champion Molly Holly struck Victoria in the head with the title belt.

The next week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Victoria became a fan favorite, when she attacked Holly after the two women were placed in a team, along with Miss Jackie, for a six-woman tag team match. During her face run, she abandoned her sadistic and unstable personality, and began wearing hippie shorts and performed a gyrating moonsault. On January 5, 2004, Victoria was set for a title match with Molly Holly, however she was attacked by Test before the match.

The angle with Molly Holly continued into the next year, with Victoria defeating Holly in tag team matches. On February 23, 2004, Victoria defeated Holly, Lita and Jazz in a fatal four-way elimination match, to win her second Women&#x27;s Championship. After defeating Holly in a tag team match the next week, Victoria was challenged by Holly to a rematch for the title at WrestleMania XX, which later became a hair vs title match. At the pay-per-view, Victoria won the match, and shaved Holly&#x27;s head bald. She held the Women&#x27;s Championship until June 13, when she dropped the title to the villainous Trish Stratus during a Fatal Four-Way match at Bad Blood, that also included Lita and Gail Kim, and was unsuccessful in regaining it in a rematch a week later. After defeating Molly Holly at Vengeance to become the number one contender, Victoria lost to Stratus at Unforgiven for the championship. Prior to Unforgiven, several of Victoria&#x27;s matches were interrupted by a mysterious person in drag, who was later revealed to be Steven Richards, with whom she was previously allied. After the match with Stratus, the storyline culminated when Richards challenged Stratus&#x27; ally Tyson Tomko to a match, which Richards lost.

==== Vince&#x27;s Devils (2005–2006) ====
On the May 30, 2005 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Victoria participated in a swimsuit contest, losing to Christy Hemme. Following the loss, the storyline had Victoria become a villainess by attacking the other contestants, as well as host Jerry Lawler, claiming that she had enough of the attention Hemme was receiving. The two engaged in a short feud which culminated in a match at Vengeance, which Victoria won. During her heel run, Victoria adopted the gimmick of a bully-like enforcer, when she was placed in an angle alongside Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle (collectively known as the Ladies in Pink, and later Vince&#x27;s Devils) on August 29, portraying the role of the group&#x27;s enforcer, as the three women joined forces against the 2005 Diva Search winner Ashley Massaro. Massaro was assisted in the storyline feud by Trish Stratus, and at Unforgiven, Victoria and Wilson were defeated by Stratus and Massaro. The angle continued into &quot;WWE Homecoming&quot;, where the Ladies in Pink lost a Handicap Bra and Panties match to Stratus and Massaro. The three of them competed in the first ever Bra and Panties gauntlet match, where Ashley was declared the winner by last eliminating Victoria. She lost to male wrestler Carlito on the December 26, 2005 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. At the 2006 Royal Rumble, they appeared flirting with Vince McMahon.

On March 6, 2006, on &quot;Raw&quot;, Victoria and Candice turned on Wilson during Candice&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot; cover unveiling, starting an angle between the former teammates. A scheduled match was set to take place at &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXII&quot; with Victoria and Candice against Wilson and Stratus. As part of the storyline, however, on the episode of &quot;Raw&quot; prior to the event, Wilson was found unconscious, with the implication being that Victoria and Candice had attacked her. The match eventually took place on March 27, with Victoria and Candice being defeated. The alliance of Victoria and Candice fell apart during a tag team match on July 17, in which Victoria and Mickie James were defeated by Wilson and Trish Stratus, with Candice as the special guest referee.

==== Various feuds and departure (2007–2009) ====

Victoria was given a push on November 27, after she won a number one contender&#x27;s battle royal. Varon gained notoriety from the match when it was reported that her kick to Candice Michelle&#x27;s face had resulted in a legitimate broken nose that required surgery. Following the victory, the angle had her carry a checklist to the ring which contained the names of other Divas. Each week, she checked a name off the list after defeating them in matches. She also defeated WWE Women&#x27;s Champion Mickie James in a non-title match. Victoria lost the championship match against James at New Year&#x27;s Revolution, and a rematch on January 15, 2007.

On June 17, Victoria was moved to the SmackDown! brand as part of the WWE Supplemental Draft. Victoria became involved in an on-screen relationship with Kenny Dykstra, and the duo was placed in feuds against Torrie Wilson and Jimmy Wang Yang, as well as Michelle McCool and Chuck Palumbo. While on a tour of Europe with WWE in December 2007, Varon claimed to have legitimately broken McCool&#x27;s nose.
Victoria later allied herself with the debuting Natalya in April. At the Backlash pay-per-view on April 27, Victoria teamed up with Natalya, Beth Phoenix, Jillian Hall, Layla and Melina to defeat Mickie James, Maria, Ashley, Michelle McCool, Cherry and Kelly Kelly. On the May 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Victoria and Natalya defeated McCool and Cherry. In October, Victoria lost to the debuting Brie Bella, when Brie disappeared under the ring during the match, emerged appearing refreshed, and won. On the September 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Victoria and Natalya lost to Maria and Brie. On the October 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Victoria teamed up with Natalya and Maryse in losing effort to Michelle McCool, Maria and Brie. On the November 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Victoria was accompanied by Natalya, where she was once again defeated by Brie. After the match, it was revealed that Brie had been switching places under the ring with her twin sister, Nikki Bella, and the twins proceeded to attack Victoria and Natalya. On the November 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Victoria teamed up with Natalya in losing effort to The Bella Twins (Nikki and Brie). On the November 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Victoria teamed up with Natalya and Maryse to defeat the Bella Twins and Michelle McCool.

With two more years of her contract remaining, Varon asked for her release when WWE told her they have no plans for her. Her last match took place on the January 16, 2009 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, against Michelle McCool. She then thanked the fans, and gave farewell to staff at ringside.

After leaving WWE, Varon began training for a career in mixed martial arts, and practiced Jiu Jitsu. She returned to WWE for one night only in April 2009, when she was part of the 25 Divas battle royal at WrestleMania XXV, outlasting the five other former WWE Divas. She eliminated Maria, but was eliminated by The Bella Twins.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2009-2013) ===

==== Debut and Knockouts Champion (2009–2010) ====

On May 24, 2009, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) confirmed that Varon had signed a contract with the company. She debuted on the May 28, 2009 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, under the ring name Tara, later revealed to be short for &quot;Tarantula&quot;. She made her intentions known by attacking The Beautiful People (Angelina Love, Velvet Sky, and Madison Rayne) after Love&#x27;s match with Sojournor Bolt, establishing herself as a fan favorite. On the June 11 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara won her debut match against Madison Rayne. On the July 1 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara began bringing her pet tarantula, named Poison, with her to the ring. After winning a tag team match against The Beautiful People, she put the spider on the unconscious body of Velvet Sky. On the July 9 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, after Tara threatened to put her spider on Sky once again, Angelina Love agreed to put her TNA Knockouts Championship on the line, which Tara ultimately won, only to lose the title back to Love two weeks later at Victory Road.
On the September 24 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara teamed with the new Knockouts Champion ODB to challenge Sarita and Taylor Wilde for the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship, but they lost after Awesome Kong interrupted and distracted her during the bout. During the following two weeks of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara and Kong both received one-on-one Knockouts Championship matches from ODB, but both of them ended up losing after the other interfered in the match. At Bound for Glory, ODB defeated both Tara and Kong in a three-way match to retain the title. During the match, Tara was confronted by mixed martial artist Kim Couture to set up an MMA fight between the two, which, however, never came to fruition. At Turning Point, Tara defeated Kong in a Six Sides of Steel match. On November 26, Tara won a ten-woman battle royal to earn a shot at the Knockouts Championship at Final Resolution. At the event, she defeated ODB to win the Knockouts Championship for the second time. On the January 4, 2010 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara lost the title back to ODB. Two weeks later at Genesis, Tara defeated ODB in a two out of three falls match to regain the title, making her a three-time champion.

On the February 18, 2010 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara defeated Daffney by disqualification, after she hit Tara with a toolbox. At Destination X, Tara successfully defended her title against Daffney, who stole Poison the tarantula from her after the match. On the March 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara retained her title against Daffney for a second time, this time in the first ever women&#x27;s First Blood match in TNA. On the April 5 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara was one of the four winners in an eight-Knockout Lockbox match. The box she opened contained her pet tarantula, Poison. At the same time, however, Tara lost the Knockouts Championship to Angelina Love, and began turning villainous due to her friction with Love heading into their match against The Beautiful People. At Lockdown, the villainous Tara attacked Love after losing a tag team steel cage match against Rayne and Sky, cementing Tara&#x27;s heel turn.

==== Alliance with Madison Rayne (2010–2011) ====
On April 28, 2010, Varon announced on her MySpace blog that she would be leaving TNA the following month, after refusing to re-sign with the company, due to not receiving a pay increase. On the May 3 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara challenged Madison Rayne to a match at Sacrifice, where she would put her career on the line against Rayne&#x27;s Knockouts Championship. At Sacrifice on May 16, Tara failed to win the match, and as a result her TNA career came to an end. After her TNA career came to a halt, she continued to discuss a new contract with Dixie Carter.
She returned to the company on July 11 at Victory Road as a villainess, disguising herself by wearing a motorcycle helmet and attacking Angelina Love during her match for the Knockouts Championship. In the following weeks, she aligned herself with Madison Rayne against Love and Velvet Sky. Tara was ultimately unmasked on the September 2 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, when she and Rayne defeated Love and Sky in a tag team match, after hitting Sky with the motorcycle helmet. On the September 30 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Rayne signed a waiver to allow Tara to return to in-ring competition. At Bound for Glory, Tara defeated Angelina Love, Velvet Sky, and Madison Rayne in a Four Corners match to win the Knockout Championship for the fourth time, much to the dismay of Rayne, who thought Tara&#x27;s intention was to help her regain the title. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara laid down for Rayne and allowed her to pin her to regain the Knockouts Championship, giving Tara the shortest reign in the title&#x27;s history. The following week, Tara attacked Mickie James after her victory over Sarita. At Turning Point, Tara wrestled James to a double disqualification, after James pushed the referee, and they began brawling. On the December 2 &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara attacked James while she was singing her single &quot;Hardcore Country&quot;, which later led to James attacking her. At Final Resolution, Tara defeated James in a Falls Count Anywhere match, following interference from Madison Rayne. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, James defeated Tara in a steel cage match. During the match, Tara legitimately tore a ligament in her elbow, but the injury did not require surgery. On the December 16 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Tara and Rayne defeated James and Ms. Tessmacher to advance the finals of a tournament for the vacant TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship. The following week, they were defeated in the finals by Angelina Love and Winter.

In 2011, Madison Rayne would start a rivalry with Mickie James over the Knockouts Championship, and would successfully defend the title against her at Genesis and Against All Odds, after Tara interfered in both matches. During the feud, Tara began claiming that Rayne had gone too far in her brutality towards Mickie James, but was forced to follow her orders due to being under exclusive contract with her, and not TNA. After Rayne lost the Knockouts Championship to James at Lockdown, James agreed to give her a rematch on the condition that if she is unable to regain the title, Tara would be released from her contract with Rayne. On May 15 at Sacrifice, Tara became a fan favorite after knocking out Rayne during her match with James, costing her the Knockouts Championship and guaranteeing herself a release from her contract with Rayne.

==== TnT, relationship with Jesse and departure (2011–2013) ====

Tara and Madison Rayne had their first match against each other since the break–up of their partnership on the May 19 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, where Tara teamed with Mickie James and Ms. Tessmacher against Rayne, Sarita and Rosita. Tara won the match for her team by pinning Rosita, after Rayne, who avoided her former partner throughout the match, sacrificed her in order to get away from the ring. Tara and Rayne faced each other again on the July 14 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, where Tara was victorious after distracting Rayne with her tarantula. On the July 21 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Tara and Ms. Tessmacher, later named TnT, defeated Mexican America (Rosita and Sarita) to win the TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship. Tessmacher and Tara made their first title defense on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, defeating Mexican America in a rematch. On the September 29 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Tara was defeated by her former partner Madison Rayne in a match to determine the third and final challenger for the TNA Knockouts Championship at Bound for Glory. On the November 3 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Tara and Tessmacher lost the Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Gail Kim and Madison Rayne. On the January 26, 2012 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Tara defeated Mickie James and Velvet Sky in a three-way match to earn a match for the Knockouts Championship. On February 12 at Against All Odds, Tara was unsuccessful in her title challenge against Gail Kim.
On the August 23 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Tara defeated the new Knockouts Champion and TnT partner Miss Tessmacher in a non-title match, and was subsequently named number one contender for her title. On September 9 at the No Surrender, Tara challenged Tessmacher for the Knockouts Championship, but failed to capture the title.
On the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Tara congratulated Tessmacher on her victory, only to attack Tessmacher shortly afterwards, turning Tara into a villainess and effectively disbanding TnT. On the September 27 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Tara defeated ODB in a number one contender&#x27;s match to earn another shot at Miss Tessmacher&#x27;s Knockouts Championship. On October 14 at Bound for Glory, Tara defeated Tessmacher to win the TNA Knockouts Championship for a record-tying fifth time. Afterwards, Tara introduced her &quot;Hollywood boyfriend&quot;, the debuting Jesse. Tara made her first successful title defense on the October 25 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, defeating Tessmacher in a rematch following interference from Jesse. On November 11 at Turning Point, Tara and Jesse were defeated by ODB and Eric Young. On December 9 at Final Resolution, Tara successfully defended her Knockouts Championship against Mickie James after a distraction from Jesse. On the December 20 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Tara defeated James again to retain her title. Tara went on to have another successful title defense on the January 25, 2013, episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, defeating Velvet Sky. On the February 21 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; taped in London, England, Tara lost the championship to Sky in a fatal four-way elimination match, also involving Gail Kim and Miss Tessmacher, ending her reign at 104 days. Tara received her rematch on the February 28 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, but was again defeated by Sky. The following months, Tara would make increasingly fewer appearances, and would be rarely used competing in matches. On the July 14 episode of &quot;TNA Xplosion&quot;, Tara would wrestle her final match in TNA losing to ODB. Two days later on July 16, Tara was released from her TNA contract. Varon later stated in an interview that she was close to leaving TNA prior to her release, and that she would never return to TNA. She also stated that her tenure in TNA was great, but different from WWE and made her &quot;appreciate WWE a lot&quot;.

In May 2008, she and her husband opened a custom car shop, Black Widow Customs, in Louisville. The shop was destroyed on December 16, 2010, in a fire, which the authorities deemed suspicious. This occurred the day after a local TV show&#x27;s &quot;Consumer Watch&quot; segment. Antwane Glenn, a football player at the University of Kentucky, wanted a refund after claiming his car was left un-drivable following Black Widow Customs&#x27; work on it. He contacted WHAS11 and the story was profiled on the show.

In March 2013, Varon opened a wrestling themed restaurant in Chicago, Illinois named The Squared Circle. In January 2015, Varon announced that she would be moving back to California, and leaving the restaurant to be run by her estranged husband Lee Varon. In March 2015, the restaurant was put up for sale. One week later, a gunman entered the restaurant and Lee Varon was able to incapacitate the man until police arrived. Days after the gunman incident and the resulting media attention, Lisa Marie Varon announced her intention to close the establishment and that she would no longer support the business or encourage fellow wrestlers to make promotional appearances there. The restaurant closed on April 10, 2017, just two years after the gunman incident.

<text>Xiang&#x27;an is one of the districts of Xiamen, People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is located on the mainland, and is Xiamen&#x27;s easternmost district.

==Geography==

Dadeng Subdistrict of Xiang&#x27;an District is made up of offshore islands and islets including:
*Dadeng (Tateng) ()
*Xiaodeng ()
*Jiaoyu ()
*Baihajiao ()
Dadeng (大嶝/大嶝島), Xiaodeng (小嶝/小嶝島) and Jiaoyu (角嶼) were part of Kinmen County in Republican China and are claimed by modern Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan). The islands have been under PRC control since October 9 or October 15, 1949.

==Administrative divisions==
Xiang&#x27;an District administers one subdistrict, four towns and one other area:
* Dadeng Subdistrict (大嶝街道, formerly 大嶝镇)
* Xindian ()
* Xinxu ()
* Maxiang ()
* Neicuo ()
* Damaoshan Farm ()

The district was created out of five towns () of Tong&#x27;an District in October 19, 2003. Since then Dadeng Town has been renamed Dadeng Subdistrict () and made the district seat.

==Transport==
The Xiamen Xiang&#x27;an Tunnel is located in the district. The tunnel is about long, including of road under water. It starts from Wutong of Xiamen Island and terminates at Xibin, Xiang&#x27;an District, Xiamen. It was completed in November 2009 and was at the time the first tunnel of its kind on the mainland.

==Healthcare==
The Healthcare industry started rapidly adopting AI technology applications in 2017 and at the beginning of 2018 the People&#x27;s Government of Xiang’an Xiamen announced plans to build China&#x27;s first healthcare industry centre in Xiamen. To achieve this it partnered with leading technology firms Deloitte and the Cogobuy Group.

Cogobuy Group&#x27;s subsidiary IngDan () had over 1,000 healthcare innovation projects at the time with many planned for integration into the new healthcare centre. The integration plan involved the projects gradually being introduced into the city&#x27;s new healthcare centre and focused on promoting healthcare projects, establishing healthcare industry investment funds, as well as the build out of a new healthcare medical data platform.

==Education==

Xiang&#x27;an district is the location of the new campus of Xiamen University.

Completed in 2013, the 243 hectare campus makes the university the second largest in China by student numbers and area - with regular shuttle buses to the historic Siming Campus in the city centre away.

It is predicted to accommodate up to 30,000 students. The campus has an automobile-free policy; most journeys by students and faculty are made on bicycles.

<doc id="305384" wikidata="Q5178440" url="?curid=305384" title="Court reporter">
<text>A court reporter, court stenographer, or shorthand reporter is a person whose occupation is to capture the live testimony in proceedings using a stenographic machine or a stenomask, thereby transforming the proceedings into an official certified transcript by nature of their training, certification, and usually licensure. This can include courtroom hearings and trials, depositions and discoveries, sworn statements, and more.

== United States ==
In certain states, a court reporter is a notary, by virtue of their state licensing, and a notary public is authorized to administer oaths to witnesses and certify that their transcript of the proceedings is a verbatim account of what was said—unlike a court &quot;recorder&quot;, whose job is to operate audio recording devices and send the recorded files for transcription over the internet. Many states require a court reporter to hold a certification obtained through the National Court Reporters Association, National Verbatim Reporters Association or The American Association of Electronic Reporters and Transcribers; still, others require their own state-specific licensing or certification.

=== Skills and training ===
It typically takes anywhere from two to four years to learn the basic skills to become a stenographic court reporter. Applicants first learn to use the steno keyboard (which takes the most time), and heavy academic training is also required. Candidates usually attend specialized certificate courses at private business schools or sometimes associate&#x27;s or bachelor&#x27;s degree programs at accredited colleges and universities. Distance learning and online training courses are also available. After additional on-the-job training and experience, many court reporters then move on to realtime reporting.

Required skills of a licensed stenographic court reporter are excellent command of the language being spoken, attention to detail, exceptional hearing, and the ability to focus for long periods at a time. The most highly skilled court reporters can provide real-time transcription and have significant earning potential, with salaries up to six figures possible in some areas.

In 2004, Mark Kislingbury secured the title of fastest realtime court reporter through Guinness World Records by writing 360 words per minute on his stenographic machine.

===Licensing===
Most states require that court reporters obtain a license via examination before being allowed to practice in that respective state. Examinations include writing speed tests at 180 wpm, 200 wpm and 225 wpm, and a written examination to demonstrate proficiency in English, grammar, medical terminology, legal terminology, courtroom decorum, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 30, court reporting procedure and ethics.

Licensed court reporters are required to attend yearly continuing education courses of at least 10 hours in order to maintain active licensure.

===Court Reporting Professional associations and licensing entities===
The National Court Reporters Association (NCRA) is a national stenographic court reporting association in the United States. Stenographers can also join the National Verbatim Reporters Association (NVRA), a professional organization dedicated to the practice of voice writing, which is another method used to take down court proceedings in certain states. For court recorders who also operate audio equipment, there is the American Association of Electronic Reporters and Transcribers (AAERT). Court reporters, voice writers, and transcribers must pass both a written and practical examination.

The NCRA offers the title Registered Professional Reporter (RPR) to those who pass a four-part examination, including a three-part skills exam and a written exam, and participate in continuing education programs. A court reporter may obtain additional prestigious certifications that demonstrate an even higher level of competency, such as Registered Merit Reporter (RMR), Certified Real-time Reporter (CRR), Certified Realtime Captioner (CRC), or Certificate of Merit (CM), Certified Broadcast Captioner (CBC), and Certified CART Provider (CCP). 

The NVRA offers the title Certified Verbatim Reporter (CVR) to voice writers who pass a four-part examination, including both a skills and written exam, and participate in continuing education programs.

===Non-Stenographic Certifications===
The AAERT offers electronic recorders and transcribers three certifications: certified electronic recorder (CER), certified electronic transcriber (CET), and certified electronic recorder and transcriber (CERT) for setup and use of basic recording equipment. Transcription, however, is not performed by the court recorder in most cases. The International Alliance of Professional Reporters and Transcribers (IAPRT.org) is a member-based not-for-profit consortium engaged in the ongoing development of digital court recording and transcription, and guiding public and private court recording paraprofessionals worldwide toward the goal of producing as much of a verbatim and verifiable record as possible given the number of limits of even modern-day recording equipment.

===Salary and job outlook===
In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to report a positive job outlook for stenographic court reporters. Median annual salary in 2022 was listed at $63,560 per year. The top 10 percent of court reporters earned more than $91,280. In May 2012, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed &quot;stenographic court reporter&quot; as one of the best jobs that does not require a four-year degree. As of 2015, the median annual salary for a court reporter was $50,000. The actual amount can vary depending on whether the court reporter works in an in-court capacity as an &quot;official&quot; reporter or as a reporter of pre-trial discovery (depositions). Additionally, pay can vary based on whether the original and/or a copy of the transcript is ordered by any of the parties to the action. The growth rate of the profession was projected to be 2% to 3%, which is lower than the average of 7%, but the demand has remained high due to a national rise in litigation overall. The &quot;Ducker Report,&quot; commissioned by the National Court Reporters Association (NCRA) to assess the state of the profession, predicted the stenographic court reporters workforce would total approximately 27,700 in 2018. Contrary to these projections, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the actual number to be around 21,300 in 2022, indicating a faster-than-expected decline. This underscores a pivotal moment for the profession, exacerbated by reports from numerous state certification boards of a sustained decrease in court reporter applicants. In some states, this decrease is as stark as an 85% reduction over the last five years.

As of 2012, Maryland employed the most court reporters, while New York has the highest average salary. Some states have experienced budget cuts in recent years that have reduced the number of state-funded court reporters. This has resulted in law firms hiring stenographic court reporters directly, as they are independent contractors, to ensure proceedings are verbatim.

In England, as of 2023, the estimated yearly salary for a court reporter was in the range of £28,000-£35,000 (approx. US $35,000-$44,000). In 2014, the salary for freelance court reporters varied, with realtime reporters earning around £405.88 (approx. US $512.59) per day.

=== Work ===
A Certified Realtime Reporter (CRR) and a Certified Broadcast Captioner (CBC) offer the ability to show live transcription of the spoken record by captioning what is said to display it on a screen in real time, and as the latter is a stenographic court reporter, they can provide instant read back of testimony unlike a recording. Digital recordings often operated by court clerks or AAERT members are able to provide for instant playback or review of portions of the recording with the appropriate reporting software.

Many stenographic court reporters work as freelance reporters or independent contractors in depositions and other situations that require an official legal transcript, such as arbitration hearings or other formal proceedings. CART providers (Communication Access Realtime Translation) also often provide realtime services for public events, religious services, webcasts, and educational services. Stenographic court reporting most often allows for a quality transcript produced on an hourly, daily, expedited, or standard turnaround.

Stenographic court reporters working as broadcast captioners often contract with or by television producers and stations to provide realtime closed captioning of live programs.

== Canada ==

=== Education ===
There is one NCRA-approved captioning and court reporting program in all of Canada, which is found at the Northern Institute of Technology (NAIT) in Edmonton, Alberta. It is a two-year course that teaches machine shorthand (stenography). To obtain a diploma, one must pass two-voice speed tests at 225 words per minute with 95% accuracy. Other classes include software training, English, and law. NAIT also offers the NCRA A to Z® Program, a free six-week course that introduces the basics of steno. Between 2017 and 2020, graduates of NAIT&#x27;s captioning and court reporting program reported a median salary of $70,000 CAD.

=== Professional associations ===
There are three active professional associations in Canada: Association professionnelle des sténographes officiels du Québec (APSOQ), Alberta Shorthand Reporters Association (ASRA), and British Columbia Shorthand Reporters Association (BCSRA).
=== Designations ===

==== Certified Shorthand Reporter (Alberta) ====
After graduating school and completing an internship, Alberta court reporters must earn continuing education credits to maintain their Certified Shorthand Reporter designation, which is a protected title under the &quot;Professional and Occupational Associations Registration Act&quot; of Alberta. Certified Shorthand Reporters must be members of the ASRA.Certified Shorthand Reporters are highly skilled professionals who are required to have post-secondary education from an accredited court reporting school with an emphasis on grammar, law, medical terminology, and Canadian legal procedures; complete a supervised internship; and participate in professional development opportunities.

==== Official Reporter (British Columbia) ====
An Official Reporter designation is granted by the Attorney General of BC. To receive such a designation, a person must be able to write 200+ word per minute using shorthand.An examination for discovery must be conducted before an official reporter who is empowered to administer the oath.

==== Authorized Reporter (British Columbia) ====
An Authorized Reporter designation is granted by the Attorney General of BC. To receive such a designation, a person must either &quot;have 1,000 hours of work experience performing the functions of an official reporter...within two of the immediately past five years&quot; or &quot;hold certification as a real time reporter with NCRA and have at least 500 hours of work experience performing the functions of an official reporter within two of the past five years.&quot;

== Methods ==
Court reporters use stenography to capture the spoken word verbatim. The skills of court reporters are primarily measured through certification exams and licensing. The training on a stenograph machine requires the person to pass writing speed tests of up to 225 words a minute on their machine in the United States, as set forth by the National Court Reporters Association (NCRA). Only a small percentage of court reporting students per year are able to reach this goal, but with NCRA&#x27;s &quot;A to Z Steno&quot; program and virtual classrooms around the country, the number of stenographic court reporters is on the rise.

Court recorders use multi-channel, digital audio to allow for isolated playback of channels during transcription. This allows transcribers to listen from different vantage points when playing back the audio. This multi-channel feature especially helps during moments of extraneous noise such as laughter, shouting, coughing, and sneezing, but it is still deemed inferior to having a stenographic reporter during the proceedings. The American Association of Electronic Recorders and Transcribers (AAERT) certifies recorders and transcribers. AAERT certified recorders are trained to attempt to monitor the recording continuously during a proceeding and create simple notes, or a log, which are individually time-stamped. The time-stamps correspond with the location on the digital recording for playback either upon request during a proceeding or at a later time. The log notes provide the opportunity to search and identify any segment of the proceeding. Some courts train clerks or other court personnel to operate the digital recording equipment. While court systems benefit from the income from these systems directly, the equipment is maintained by outside vendors and staff cannot repair malfunctioning equipment even if aware of the problem. Courtroom monitors are responsible for listening to the recording through headphones while the proceeding occurs. However, there is no way to ensure recording quality.

Court reporters can also use voice writing equipment to take down court proceedings. Called &quot;voice writers,&quot; they dictate verbatim what attorneys, witnesses, and others are saying into a stenomask, which is connected to a computer and uses voice recognition software. This training requires a person pass dictation speed tests of up to 225 words a minute in the United States, as set forth by the National Verbatim Reporters Association (NVRA).

<doc id="305387" wikidata="Q376666" url="?curid=305387" title="Cholecystitis">
<text>Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder. Symptoms include right upper abdominal pain, pain in the right shoulder, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally fever. Often gallbladder attacks (biliary colic) precede acute cholecystitis. The pain lasts longer in cholecystitis than in a typical gallbladder attack. Without appropriate treatment, recurrent episodes of cholecystitis are common. Complications of acute cholecystitis include gallstone pancreatitis, common bile duct stones, or inflammation of the common bile duct.
More than 90% of the time acute cholecystitis is caused from blockage of the cystic duct by a gallstone. Risk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, a family history of gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. Occasionally, acute cholecystitis occurs as a result of vasculitis or chemotherapy, or during recovery from major trauma or burns. Cholecystitis is suspected based on symptoms and laboratory testing. Abdominal ultrasound is then typically used to confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment is usually with laparoscopic gallbladder removal, within 24 hours if possible. Taking pictures of the bile ducts during the surgery is recommended. The routine use of antibiotics is controversial. They are recommended if surgery cannot occur in a timely manner or if the case is complicated. Stones in the common bile duct can be removed before surgery by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or during surgery. Complications from surgery are rare. In people unable to have surgery, gallbladder drainage may be tried.
About 10–15% of adults in the developed world have gallstones. Women more commonly have stones than men and they occur more commonly after age 40. Certain ethnic groups are more often affected; for example, 48% of American Indians have gallstones. Of all people with stones, 1–4% have biliary colic each year. If untreated, about 20% of people with biliary colic develop acute cholecystitis. Once the gallbladder is removed outcomes are generally good. Without treatment, chronic cholecystitis may occur. The word is from Greek, &quot;cholecyst-&quot; meaning &quot;gallbladder&quot; and &quot;-itis&quot; meaning &quot;inflammation&quot;.
==Signs and symptoms==

Most people with gallstones do not have symptoms. However, when a gallstone temporarily lodges in the cystic duct, they experience biliary colic. Biliary colic is abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastric region. It is episodic, occurring after eating greasy or fatty foods, and leads to nausea and/or vomiting. People with cholecystitis most commonly have symptoms of biliary colic before developing cholecystitis. The pain becomes severe and constant in cholecystitis. Nausea is common and vomiting occurs in 75% of people with cholecystitis. In addition to abdominal pain, right shoulder pain can be present.

On physical examination, an inflamed gallbladder is almost always tender to the touch and palpable (~25-50% of cases) in the midclavicular right lower rib margin. Additionally, a fever is common. Pain with deep inspiration leading to termination of the breath while pressing on the right upper quadrant of the abdomen usually causes severe pain (Murphy&#x27;s sign). Yellowing of the skin (jaundice) may occur but is often mild. Severe jaundice suggests another cause of symptoms such as choledocholithiasis. People who are old, have diabetes, chronic illness, or who are immunocompromised may have vague symptoms that may not include fever or localized tenderness.

===Complications===
A number of complications may occur from cholecystitis if not detected early or properly treated. Signs of complications include high fever, shock and jaundice. Complications include the following:
* Gangrene
* Gallbladder rupture
* Empyema
* Fistula formation and gallstone ileus
* Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses

==== Gangrene and gallbladder rupture ====
Cholecystitis causes the gallbladder to become distended and firm. Distension can lead to decreased blood flow to the gallbladder, causing tissue death and eventually gangrene. Once tissue has died, the gallbladder is at greatly increased risk of rupture (perforation), which can cause sharp pain. Rupture can also occur in cases of chronic cholecystitis. Rupture is a rare but serious complication that leads to abscess formation or peritonitis. Massive rupture of the gallbladder has a mortality rate of 30%.

==== Empyema ====
Untreated cholecystitis can lead to worsened inflammation and infected bile that can lead to a collection of pus inside the gallbladder, also known as empyema. The symptoms of empyema are similar to uncomplicated cholecystitis but greater severity: high fever, severe abdominal pain, more severely elevated white blood count.

==== Fistula formation and gallstone ileus ====
The inflammation of cholecystitis can lead to adhesions between the gallbladder and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly the duodenum. These adhesions can lead to the formation of direct connections between the gallbladder and gastrointestinal tract, called fistulas. With these direct connections, gallstones can pass from the gallbladder to the intestines. Gallstones can get trapped in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly at the connection between the small and large intestines (ileocecal valve). When a gallstone gets trapped, it can lead to an intestinal obstruction, called gallstone ileus, leading to abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distension.

==Causes==
Cholecystitis occurs when the gallbladder becomes inflamed. Gallstones are the most common cause of gallbladder inflammation but it can also occur due to blockage from a tumor or scarring of the bile duct. The greatest risk factor for cholecystitis is gallstones. Risk factors for gallstones include female sex, increasing age, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, obesity, diabetes mellitus, ethnicity (Native North American), rapid weight loss.

=== Acute calculous cholecystitis ===
Gallstones blocking the flow of bile account for 90% of cases of cholecystitis (acute calculous cholecystitis). Blockage of bile flow leads to thickening and buildup of bile causing an enlarged, red, and tense gallbladder. The gallbladder is initially sterile but often becomes infected by bacteria, predominantly &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, and &quot;Clostridium&quot; species. Inflammation can spread to the outer covering of the gallbladder and surrounding structures such as the diaphragm, causing referred right shoulder pain.

=== Acalculous cholecystitis ===
In acalculous cholecystitis, no stone is in the biliary ducts. It accounts for 5–10% of all cases of cholecystitis and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Acalculous cholecystitis is typically seen in people who are hospitalized and critically ill. Males are more likely to develop acute cholecystitis following surgery in the absence of trauma. It is associated with many causes including vasculitis, chemotherapy, major trauma or burns.

The presentation of acalculous cholecystitis is similar to calculous cholecystitis. Patients are more likely to have yellowing of the skin (jaundice) than in calculous cholecystitis. Ultrasonography or computed tomography often shows an immobile, enlarged gallbladder. Treatment involves immediate antibiotics and cholecystectomy within 24–72 hours.

=== Chronic cholecystitis ===
Chronic cholecystitis occurs after repeated episodes of acute cholecystitis and is almost always due to gallstones. Chronic cholecystitis may be asymptomatic, may present as a more severe case of acute cholecystitis, or may lead to a number of complications such as gangrene, perforation, or fistula formation.

Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is a rare form of chronic cholecystitis which mimics gallbladder cancer although it is not cancerous. It was first reported in the medical literature in 1976 by McCoy and colleagues.

==Mechanism==
Blockage of the cystic duct by a gallstone causes a buildup of bile in the gallbladder and increased pressure within the gallbladder. Concentrated bile, pressure, and sometimes bacterial infection irritate and damage the gallbladder wall, causing inflammation and swelling of the gallbladder. Inflammation and swelling of the gallbladder can reduce normal blood flow to areas of the gallbladder, which can lead to cell death due to inadequate oxygen.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of cholecystitis is suggested by the history (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever) and physical examinations in addition to laboratory and ultrasonographic testing. Boas&#x27;s sign, which is pain in the area below the right scapula, can be a symptom of acute cholecystitis.

=== Blood tests ===
In someone suspected of having cholecystitis, blood tests are performed for markers of inflammation (e.g. complete blood count, C-reactive protein), as well as bilirubin levels in order to assess for bile duct blockage. Complete blood count typically shows an increased white blood count (12,000–15,000/mcL). C-reactive protein is usually elevated although not commonly measured in the United States. Bilirubin levels are often mildly elevated (1–4 mg/dL). If bilirubin levels are more significantly elevated, alternate or additional diagnoses should be considered such as gallstone blocking the common bile duct (common bile duct stone). Less commonly, blood aminotransferases are elevated. The degree of elevation of these laboratory values may depend on the degree of inflammation of the gallbladder.

=== Imaging ===
Right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound is most commonly used to diagnose cholecystitis. Ultrasound findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis include gallstones, pericholecystic fluid (fluid surrounding the gallbladder), gallbladder wall thickening (wall thickness over 3 mm), dilation of the bile duct, and sonographic Murphy&#x27;s sign. Given its higher sensitivity, hepatic iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan can be used if ultrasound is not diagnostic. CT scan may also be used if complications such as perforation or gangrene are suspected.

===Histopathology===
Histopathology is indicated if preoperative imaging and/or gross examination gives a suspicion of gallbladder cancer.
=== Differential diagnosis ===
Many other diagnoses can have similar symptoms as cholecystitis. Additionally the symptoms of chronic cholecystitis are commonly vague and can be mistaken for other diseases. These alternative diagnoses include but are not limited to:
* Perforated peptic ulcer
* Acute pancreatitis
* Liver abscess
* Pneumonia
* Myocardial ischemia
* Hiatal hernia
* Biliary colic
* Choledocholithiasis
* Cholangitis
* Appendicitis
* Colitis
* Acute peptic ulcer exacerbation
* Amoebic liver abscess
* Acute intestinal obstruction
* Kidney stone
* Biliary ascariasis

== Treatment ==
===Surgery===
For most people with acute cholecystitis, the treatment of choice is surgical removal of the gallbladder, laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed using several small incisions located at various points across the abdomen. Several studies have demonstrated the superiority of laparoscopic cholecystectomy when compared to open cholecystectomy (using a large incision in the right upper abdomen under the rib cage). People undergoing laparoscopic surgery report less incisional pain postoperatively as well as having fewer long-term complications and less disability following the surgery. Additionally, laparoscopic surgery is associated with a lower rate of surgical site infection.

During the days prior to laparoscopic surgery, studies showed that outcomes were better following early removal of the gallbladder, preferably within the first week. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 7 days of visiting a doctor with symptoms) as compared to delayed treatment (more than 6 weeks) may result in shorter hospital stays and a decreased risk of requiring an emergency procedure. There is no difference in terms of negative outcomes including bile duct injury or conversion to open cholecystectomy. For early cholecystectomy, the most common reason for conversion to open surgery is inflammation that hides Calot&#x27;s triangle. For delayed surgery, the most common reason was fibrotic adhesions.

===Other===

Supportive measures may be instituted prior to surgery. These measures include fluid resuscitation. Intravenous opioids can be used for pain control.

Antibiotics are often not needed.

In cases of severe inflammation, shock, or if the person has higher risk for general anesthesia (required for cholecystectomy), an interventional radiologist may insert a percutaneous drainage catheter into the gallbladder (percutaneous cholecystostomy tube) and treat the person with antibiotics until the acute inflammation resolves. A cholecystectomy may then be warranted if the person&#x27;s condition improves.

Homeopathic approaches to treating cholecystitis have not been validated by evidence and should not be used in place of surgery.

== Epidemiology ==
Cholecystitis accounts for 3–10% of cases of abdominal pain worldwide. Cholecystitis caused an estimated 651,829 emergency department visits and 389,180 hospital admissions in the US in 2012. The 2012 US mortality rate was 0.7 per 100,000 people. The frequency of cholecystitis is highest in people age 50–69 years old.

<text>MBDA is a European multinational corporation specialized in the design, development and manufacturing of missiles and related systems. Headquartered in Le Plessis-Robinson, France, the company was founded in December 2001 via the merger of three of the most prominent European missile systems companies: the French Aérospatiale Matra Missiles, the Anglo-French Matra BAe Dynamics and the missile division of the Anglo-Italian Alenia Marconi Systems. These businesses were subsidiaries of EADS (now called Airbus), BAE Systems and Finmeccanica (now Leonardo), and all three remain MBDA&#x27;s parent companies.

MBDA employs around 13,000 people worldwide as of 2023 and, despite being an integrated company, has maintained national divisions since its creation: MBDA France (over 6,000 employees), MBDA UK (over 4,000) and MBDA Italy (1852). They were formed by simply grouping in their respective countries the assets and activities of the various French, British and Italian businesses that had merged to create MBDA.

In March 2006, LFK-Lenkflugkörpersysteme GmbH, the German missile subsidiary of EADS, was acquired by MBDA and in 2010, an office was opened in Madrid, Spain, leading to the formation of two additional national divisions: MBDA Germany (1,200 employees) and MBDA Spain (25).

In 2023, MBDA generated €4.5 billion in revenue. It works with over 90 armed forces worldwide and also has a number of subsidiaries, including one in the United States, MBDA Inc (50 employees).

== History ==
The consolidation within Europe&#x27;s missile industry began in 1996 when half of the missile business of Matra Hautes Technologies (the Matra conglomerate&#x27;s aerospace, defence and telecommunications division) merged with the missile activities of BAe Dynamics (itself a division of British Aerospace) to form the 50/50 joint venture Matra BAe Dynamics (MBD). Three years later, the other half of Matra Hautes Technologies&#x27;s missile business (Matra Missiles) and Aérospatiale&#x27;s missile systems division were consolidated to form Aérospatiale Matra Missiles (AMM) following the merger between Aérospatiale and Matra Hautes Technologies in 1999. As a result of these developments, the new French corporation, Aérospatiale-Matra, not only had AAM as its wholly-owned missile division but also now held Matra&#x27;s 50% stake in MBD. In 2000, Aérospatiale-Matra merged with Germany&#x27;s DASA and Spain&#x27;s CASA to form the European Aeronautic Defence and Space or EADS (now rebranded Airbus); the latter thus gained ownership of all of Aérospatiale-Matra&#x27;s assets, including its stakes in joint ventures; which is how Airbus came to be one of MBDA&#x27;s three parent companies.

In 1998, &quot;GEC-Marconi Radar and Defence Systems&quot; (a subsidiary of GEC-Marconi) and (a subsidiary of Finmeccanica) combined their missile and radar activities to form the 50/50 joint venture &quot;Alenia Marconi Systems&quot; (AMS). In 1999, British Aerospace purchased and merged with GEC-Marconi to form BAE Systems. Thus the newly-formed BAE Systems gained ownership of both BAe Dynamics&#x27; 50% stake in Matra BAe Dynamics and GEC-Marconi Radar and Defence Systems&#x27; 50% stake in Alenia Marconi Systems; while Alenia Difesa&#x27;s 50% stake in the latter remained under the ownership of Finmeccanica, which would later be rebranded Leonardo.

In December 2001, &quot;AAM&quot;, &quot;MBD&quot; and the missile systems activities of &quot;AMS&quot; merged, thus fouding &quot;MBDA&quot;. In March 2006, LFK-Lenkflugkörpersysteme GmbH (LFK), the German missile subsidiary of &quot;EADS&quot;, was acquired by MBDA. And on 9 May 2012, it was rebranded MBDA Deutschland GmbH. Together with its subsidiaries TDW and Bayern-Chemie, it forms &quot;MBDA Germany&quot;. Since February 2002, MBDA has owned 40% of Inmize Sistemas S.L., a Spanish company that was formed to integrate the experience and technology of the major Spanish defence companies in the guided weapons sector. An office was opened in the country in 2010 to manage its local activities. As AMS had R&amp;D assets located in California, MBDA also possess facilities in the United States, choosing to operate in the country via a wholly-owned subsidiary called MBDA Inc. In December 2011, MBDA Inc acquired the Viper Strike activity of Northrop Grumman in Huntsville, Alabama.

In August 2022, MBDA Missile Systems&#x27; data was hacked from a compromised external hard drive. The data allegedly included blueprints of NATO weapons used in the Russo-Ukrainian War, and 80 Gb of such data was sold for 15 Bitcoin. NATO started an investigation trying to assess and minimize the impact of this data breach.

==Products==
Overall, the group has 45 products in service and 15 more in development.
MBDA&#x27;s products include:
* Air-to-air missiles
** ASRAAM - short range, IR guided

<text>Aphanites (adj. &quot;aphanitic&quot;; ) are igneous rocks that are so fine-grained that their component mineral crystals are not visible to the naked eye (in contrast to phanerites, in which the crystals are visible to the unaided eye). This geological texture results from rapid cooling in volcanic or hypabyssal (shallow subsurface) environments. As a rule, the texture of these rocks is not the same as that of volcanic glass (e.g., obsidian), with volcanic glass being non-crystalline (amorphous), and having a glass-like appearance.

Aphanites are commonly porphyritic, having large crystals embedded in the fine groundmass, or matrix. The larger inclusions are called phenocrysts. They consist essentially of very small crystals of minerals such as plagioclase feldspar, with hornblende or augite, and may contain also biotite, quartz, and orthoclase.

<text>The Meteor is a European active radar guided beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) developed and manufactured by MBDA. It offers a multi-shot capability (multiple launches against multiple targets), and has the ability to engage highly maneuverable targets such as jet aircraft, and small targets such as UAVs and cruise missiles in a heavy electronic countermeasures (ECM) environment with a range far in excess of .

A solid-fueled ramjet motor allows the missile to cruise at a speed of over Mach 4 and provides the missile with thrust and mid-course acceleration. A two-way data link enables the launch aircraft to provide mid-course target updates or retargeting if required, including data from other parties. The data link can transmit missile information such as functional and kinematic status, information about multiple targets, and notification of target acquisition by the seeker. According to MBDA, Meteor has three to six times the kinetic performance of current air-to-air missiles of its type. The missile is equipped with both proximity and impact fuses to maximise destructive effects and reliability.

The fruit of a joint European project, Meteor missiles first entered service on the Swedish Air Force&#x27;s JAS 39 Gripens in April 2016 and officially achieved initial operating capability (IOC) in July 2016. They also equip the French Air and Space Force and the Navy&#x27;s Dassault Rafale, and the Eurofighter Typhoons of the Royal Air Force, German Air Force, Italian Air Force and Spanish Air Force. The Meteor is also intended to equip British and Italian F-35 Lightning IIs, and has been exported to various customers of the Rafale, Typhoon and Gripen.

==History==

===Requirement===
Meteor was selected in competition to meet the UK&#x27;s Staff Requirement (Air) 1239 (SR(A)1239), for a Future Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (FMRAAM) to replace the RAF&#x27;s BAe Dynamics Skyflash missiles. As the primary air-to-air armament of Eurofighter, the missile would be used against a range of fixed- and rotary-wing targets including unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles.

Although no detailed performance requirements have been publicly released, they were understood to demand launch success and no-escape zones approaching twice that of the then &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; medium-range missile, AMRAAM. The missile external geometry would be constrained by the need for compatibility with Eurofighter&#x27;s semi-recessed underfuselage launchers which had been designed for the AMRAAM. Key features of the requirement included &quot;stealthy launch, enhanced kinematics, which will provide the missile with sufficient energy to chase and destroy a highly agile manoeuvring target, robust performance in countermeasures and the ability for the launch aircraft to fire and disengage at the earliest opportunity thus enhancing aircraft survivability&quot;. These requirements were largely shaped by the perceived threat posed by advanced versions of the Russian Sukhoi Su-27 &quot;Flanker&quot; armed with extended range ramjet-powered versions of the R-77 missile.

In February 1994 the UK MoD issued a RFI on the possibility of the development of an advanced medium range air-to-air missile. Four concepts were produced in response, all using integrated rocket/ramjet propulsion:
*BAe, Alenia Difesa, GEC-Marconi, and Saab Dynamics, proposed the S225XR
*Matra proposed a derivative of the MICA, although the long-planned merger of its missile division and BAe Dynamics was expected to lead to the removal of this proposal
*Daimler-Benz Aerospace and Bayern-Chemie proposed the Advanced Air-to-Air Missile (A3M)
*Hughes, supported by the US Government, proposed an AMRAAM derivative based on upgrade work being carried out.

The competition commenced formally in June 1995 against a backdrop of government and industrial contacts between the UK, France, and Germany aimed at establishing a common requirement and an industrial consortium. Even at this early stage the competition was developing into a straight fight between a European and a US offering.

The US Government agreed to transfer development of the advanced propulsion system to the UK in support of the Hughes bid, although it was not clear how much of the work would be European. Hughes&#x27; initial offering was powered by a variable-flow ducted rocket (VFDR) which had been under development by an Atlantic Research Corporation (ARC)/Alliant Techsystems team for ten years, but the USAF had no plans at that time to develop an extended range AMRAAM since this could endanger support for the stealthy F-22 Raptor. The team had also provided information to BAe who were considering the VFDR as a powerplant for the S225XR, along with systems from Bayern Chemie and Volvo. ARC had discussions with Royal Ordnance, the only UK company with the necessary capability following Rolls-Royce&#x27;s decision to stop work on ramjets.

The UK MoD issued an Invitation to Tender (ITT) in December 1995. Responses were due in June 1996 for a UK contract valued at £800m. By February 1996 the US team was in place whereas the European effort remained fragmented. Matra and DASA&#x27;s missile division (LFK), were on the brink of a joint bid, which BAe and Alenia were also considering. The Matra/LFK proposal was based on Matra&#x27;s MICA-Rustique project using a Matra/ONERA designed self-regulating solid fuel ramjet. The merger between Matra and BAE&#x27;s missile businesses had stalled due to the French Government&#x27;s reluctance to approve the deal without British assurances that the UK would adopt a more pro-European approach to procurement. The merger was concluded in 1996 with the formation of Matra BAe Dynamics (MBD). This was not the only merger in prospect as Aérospatiale and DASA were conducting due diligence, although Matra had also expressed an interest in the former&#x27;s missile business. The German government was trying to use the UK and German requirements to forge the consolidation of the European industry into a critical mass capable of engaging the US on more equal terms.

Hughes had assembled a team including Aérospatiale (propulsion), Shorts (integration and final assembly), Thomson-Thorn Missile Electronics (TTME), Fokker Special Projects (fin actuation), and Diehl BGT Defence (warhead). Incidentally, the adoption of FMRAAM as the name of Hughes&#x27; proposal forced the UK MoD to change the title of SR(A)1239 to BVRAAM. Hughes would provide the seeker, with electronics from its Scottish subsidiary, Hughes Micro Electronics Europa. The upgraded guidance electronics would be compressed compared to the existing AMRAAM. Other changes included: a new electronic, as opposed to the usual mechanical, safe and arm device, based on Diehl BGT Defence&#x27;s IRIS-T system; a TTME digital target detection device (a two-way conformal microwave proximity fuze unit); and a shortened control and actuation system. The seeker and warhead were basically unchanged from AMRAAM&#x27;s.

The European content of Hughes&#x27; bid had been bolstered by the replacement of the ARC/ATK VFDR by an Aérospatiale-Celerg liquid-fuel ramjet with an ARC integrated nozzleless booster. This was based on studies conducted during the Simple Regulation Ramjet programme, which began in 1994. The direct-injection design used an inflatable elastomer bladder within the fuel tank to control the fuel flow and was believed to offer a lower cost approach compared to a regulated liquid ramjet requiring a turbopump and associated fuel supply hardware. Eighty percent of FMRAAM production and development would be carried out in Europe, 72% in the UK.

The European team, consisting of BAe Dynamics, Matra Defense, Alenia Difesa, GEC-Marconi, Saab Dynamics, LFK, and Bayern-Chemie was finally assembled just six weeks ahead of 11 June 1996 deadline for bids. BAe brokered an agreement whereby it would lead the team. This tie-up avoided a division in the European attempts to provide a credible alternative to the US bid. Matra and LFK had already teamed and would have bid independently, had BAe&#x27;s &quot;shuttle diplomacy&quot; failed.

BAe Dynamics&#x27; original S225XR proposal was a wingless design. However, during the international discussions the evolving UK and German proposals were found to be near identical in concept apart from the latter&#x27;s wings. The trade-off between winged and wingless configurations was very closely balanced but the wings offered increased roll damping which was believed to be useful given the asymmetric intake configuration so the German A3M configuration was adopted for the European proposal, called Meteor.

When the bids went in it was anticipated that a contract would be awarded at the end of 1997 with first deliveries by 2005.

===Risk reduction===
Following several rounds of bid clarification it was concluded in early 1997 that the risks were too high to proceed directly to development. The UK&#x27;s Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) and Sweden&#x27;s Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) therefore launched a Project Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) programme. This gave the two teams twelve months in which to refine their designs, and identify and understand the risks and how they would be mitigated. PDRR contracts were placed in August 1997 with a second ITT following in October. The results of the PDRR programme were expected in March 1998 but the procurement became ensnared in the run-up to and aftermath of the UK General Election in May 1997, as the new Labour government conducted its Strategic Defence Review. By 1998 the in-service date (ISD), defined as the first unit equipped with 72 missiles, had slipped to 2007.

The UK MoD hosted a government-to-government level briefing on 14/15 July 1997 with Italy, Germany, and Sweden to discuss the BVRAAM programme and how it might meet their requirements, with the aim of pursuing a collaborative procurement. There were issues at this time over the funding of the risk-reduction contracts, and some nations were discussing possible financial contributions to the studies in return for access to the data.

The European team hoped that, if chosen by the UK, Meteor would also be adopted by Germany, Italy, Sweden, and France. However, Germany had now formulated an even more demanding requirement. In response, DASA/LFK proposed a modified A3M, called Euraam, using a DASA Ulm K-band active seeker, with a passive receiver for stealthy engagements, and a redesigned Bayern Chemie propulsion system. The high energy of the high frequency radar (compared to the I-band used on AMRAAM) was claimed to provide an ability to &quot;burn-through&quot; most ECM and the shorter wavelength would allow the target&#x27;s position to be determined more precisely allowing the use of directional warheads. At one stage DASA was pushing their government for a two-year demonstration programme which would culminate in four unguided flight tests. This was presented as a fallback position in case the UK chose Raytheon&#x27;s proposal. More cynical observers regarded this as a tactic to push the UK towards Meteor.

Revised BVRAAM bids were submitted on 28 May 1998, with final reports in August. The US Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, wrote to his UK counterpart, George Robertson, with assurances that procurement of the Raytheon missile would not leave the UK vulnerable to US export restrictions, which could potentially handicap Eurofighter exports, a major concern highlighted by Meteor supporters. The letter assured &quot;open and complete technology transfer&quot;, adding that FMRAAM would be cleared for countries already cleared for AMRAAM and that a joint commission could be set up to consider release to other &quot;sensitive countries&quot;.

In July 1998 a formal statement of intent was signed between the governments of the UK, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Spain which, subject to the UK&#x27;s selection of Meteor, agreed to work towards joint procurement of the same missile.

In September 1998, Raytheon supplied the UK with estimated costs for AIM-120B AMRAAMs to be fielded on Tornado and as an interim weapon on Eurofighter on initial entry into service while BVRAAM was still in development. The US declined to sell the improved AIM-120C version. This was the first stage in Raytheon&#x27;s incremental approach to fielding the full capability FMRAAM. The MoD had offered both teams the opportunity to propose alternative acquisition strategies which would have involved reaching the full capability on an incremental basis by initially providing an interim capability which could later be upgraded.

Raytheon&#x27;s staged approach to meeting the full SR(A)1239 requirement offered an interim weapon with a capability between the AIM-120B AMRAAM and the FMRAAM. The Extended Range Air-to-Air Missile (ERAAM) had the FMRAAM seeker and guidance section mated to a dual-pulse solid propellant rocket motor. Raytheon estimated that ERAAM could be ready by the then Eurofighter ISD of 2004 and provided 80% of the FMRAAM capability but at only half the price. This approach played to perceived MoD budget limitations and a realisation that the main threat on which the SR(A)1239 requirement had been predicated, the advanced R-77 derivatives, did not look like entering development any time soon. An incremental approach would allow any technological advances to be incorporated into future upgrades. These could have included multi-pulse rocket motors, thrust vectoring, hybrid rockets, gel propellants, and ductless external combustion ramjets.

The Meteor team had considered an interim design, also powered by a dual-pulse solid rocket motor, but decided to offer a fully compliant solution, believing that the staged approach was not cost-effective due to concerns that upgrading from one version to the next would be more complicated than Raytheon claimed.

In February 1999 Raytheon added another interim level to their staged approach. The AIM-120B+ would feature the ERAAM/FMRAAM seeker and guidance section but attached to the AIM-120B solid rocket motor. This would be ready for Eurofighter&#x27;s 2004 ISD and could be updated to the ERAAM or FMRAAM configurations in 2005 and 2007 by swapping the propulsion system and updating the software.

At the 1999 Paris Air Show the French Defence Minister expressed his country&#x27;s interest in joining the Meteor project, putting further pressure on the UK to use BVRAAM as a focus for the consolidation of the European guided weapons industry. The French offered to fund up to 20% of the development if Meteor won the UK contest. Inter-governmental letters of intent were exchanged between the UK and French defence ministers in advance of signing the official MoU prepared by Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. The French officially joined the programme in September 1999.

In July 1999 the Swedish Air Force announced that it would not be funding development of Meteor due to a shortfall in the defence budget. However, this decision was not expected to affect Sweden&#x27;s participation in the programme, with funding being found from other sources.

The political stakes were high. On 4 August 1999, US President Bill Clinton wrote to the UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Clinton said that &quot;I believe transatlantic defence industry cooperation is essential to ensuring the continued interoperability of Allied armed forces&quot;. Blair also faced lobbying from the French President and Prime Minister, the German Chancellor, and the Spanish Prime Minister. In response, Clinton later wrote a second time to Blair, on 7 February 2000, timed to arrive before a 21 February meeting to discuss the decision. He put the case for Raytheon&#x27;s bid, underlining the phrase &quot;I feel strongly&quot; about the decision. The direct intervention of the US president emphasised the political and diplomatic significance that the BVRAAM procurement had acquired.

In autumn 1999 Raytheon offered yet another twist to its staged approach with the ERAAM+. If chosen, the US Government, in an unprecedented move, offered to merge the US AMRAAM and UK BVRAAM programmes, under joint control. ERAAM+ would be adopted by both countries, equipping Eurofighter, JSF, and the F-22, allowing economies of scale from large US procurement. ERAAM+ would retain the ERAAM dual-pulse motor but fitted to a front end incorporating all the features of Phase 3 of the US Department of Defense&#x27;s (DoD) AMRAAM Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) programme, which was planned out to 2015. These included upgraded seeker hardware and software to provide improved performance against advanced threats and replacement of the longitudinally mounted electronics boards with a circular design which reduced the volume occupied by the electronics allowing space for a longer rocket motor. As equal partners the US and UK would jointly specify and develop the new missile. It was estimated that ERAAM+ could be delivered for less than half the budget allocated for BVRAAM with a 2007 ISD. According to Raytheon, the programme would have initially provided the UK with 62% of development, production, and jobs for the MoD BVRAAM procurement and would give the UK 50% of the significantly larger US air-to-air market. The UK would have participated in the production of every AMRAAM-derivative sold around the world, projected at that time to be about 15000 over the following 15 years.

The ARC dual-pulse motor would not enable full compliance with the SR(A)1239 requirement, however it was believed to be adequate to counter the threats expected until 2012-15 when improvements to the warhead, datalink, and propulsion would be available. The slow pace of Russia&#x27;s ramjet powered R-77 derivative, a mock-up of which had been displayed at the Paris Air Show but which had not progressed past component ground tests and for which the Russian air force had no requirement due to lack of funding, was offered as evidence that the full capability required by SR(A)1239 would not be necessary for some time. At a press conference to launch ERAAM+ Raytheon said that a ramjet powerplant &quot;is not needed today&quot;.

Countering Raytheon&#x27;s proposed transatlantic team, Boeing was added to the European team, to provide expertise on aircraft integration, risk management, lean manufacturing technology and marketing activities in selected markets. Boeing also brought vast experience of dealing with the US DoD, essential in any future attempts to get Meteor on US aircraft. Although initially interested in developing a suppression of enemy air defence variant of Meteor as a successor to HARM, Boeing became less and less of an active partner as development progressed.

In late 1999 Sweden rejoined the programme. By early 2000 both teams had submitted best and final offers. The Government was expected to announce a decision in March, following a meeting of the MoD&#x27;s Equipment Approvals Committee (EAC) on 21 February. The decision was so politically delicate that some believed that the EAC would leave it to the Prime Minister when he chaired the defence and overseas policy committee. 
Last minute intervention by the UK Treasury delayed the decision, after concerns about the cost of Meteor, believed to be the preferred solution, compared to the cheaper incremental approach offered by Raytheon.

===Decision===
In May 2000 the UK Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, announced that Meteor had been selected to meet SR(A)1239. Fabrice Bregier, then chief executive officer of MBD, said &quot;This decision marks a historic milestone in the establishment of a European defence capability. For the first time, Europe will equip its fighter aircraft with a European air-to-air missile, creating interoperability and independence to export&quot;. By this stage the In Service Date was 2008.

The British House of Commons Defence Select Committee summarised the reasons behind the decision in its Tenth Report: &quot;The Meteor missile has some clear advantages over its Raytheon competitor—it appears to offer the more militarily effective solution; it should help rationalise and consolidate the European missile industry, and provide future competitions with a counterweight to US dominance in this field; and it entails a lower risk of constraints on Eurofighter exports. Although the programme is in its early days, it also offers the prospect of avoiding some of the problems that have plagued other European procurement collaborations, without arbitrary workshare divisions and with a clear project leadership role to be provided by the UK. The MoD needs to take advantage of that leadership role to keep momentum behind the project, including an early contract which will lock-in not just the contractor but also the commitments of our international partners. The cautious definition of the missile&#x27;s target in-service date may be realistic, particularly in view of the technological challenges that will have to be overcome, but in BVRAAM&#x27;s case it is a date that must be met if Eurofighter is to fulfil its potential.&quot;

The selection of Meteor was not a total loss for Raytheon, as the UK ordered a number of AIM-120s to arm Eurofighter on entry into service which was expected before Meteor development was complete.

===Pre-contract===
MBDA was formed in 2001, combining Matra BAe Dynamics, EADS&#x27; Aerospatiale Matra Missiles and the missile business of Alenia Marconi Systems as the second largest missile company after Raytheon.

Negotiations to conclude a smart procurement contract continued. At the Paris Air Show 2001 defence ministers from France, Sweden, and the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding committing their nations to the Meteor programme. The nations of the other industrial partners, Germany, Italy, and Spain, only signalled an intention to sign within a few weeks, claiming procedural delays within their national procurement systems. Following parliamentary approval in August, Italy signed the Memorandum on 26 September 2001, for an anticipated procurement of about 400 missiles. Spain followed on 11 December 2001.

Germany&#x27;s financial contribution to the programme was considered essential but for more than two years development was hamstrung by the repeated failure of the German defence budget committee to approve funding. Without the German propulsion system, MBDA deemed that Meteor could not realistically proceed. During this gap in the programme MBDA was funding Meteor from its own resources and, by June 2002, had spent around £70m - most of which had gone, ironically, to Bayern-Chemie to reduce technical risk in the propulsion system, the performance of which was critical to meeting the requirements.

Germany had set two conditions for participation in the project: that the UK should place a contract for the weapon; and that MBDA give a guaranteed level of performance, both of which were achieved by 30 April 2002. It was hoped to sign an agreement at that summer&#x27;s Farnborough Air Show.

However Germany would not approve funding for the project until December 2002, at the same time cutting its planned acquisition from 1,488 to 600 missiles.

==Description==
===Seeker===
Terminal guidance is provided by an active radar homing seeker which is a joint development between MBDA&#x27;s Seeker Division and Thales Airborne Systems and builds on their co-operation on the AD4A (Active Anti-Air Seeker) family of seekers that equip the MICA and Aster missiles.

===Forebody===
The active radar proximity fuze subsystem (PFS) is provided by Saab Bofors Dynamics (SBD). The PFS detects the target and calculates the optimum time to detonate the warhead in order to achieve the maximum lethal effect. The PFS has four antennae, arranged symmetrically around the forebody. The Impact Sensor is fitted inside the PFS. Behind the PFS is a section containing thermal batteries, provided by ASB, the AC Power Supply Unit, and the Power and Signal Distribution Unit. In August 2003 SBD received a contract worth SEK 450 million to develop the PFS.

===Warhead===
The blast-fragmentation warhead is produced by TDW. The warhead is a structural component of the missile. A Telemetry and Break-Up System (TBUS) replaces the warhead on trials missiles.

===Propulsion===
The propulsion sub-system (PSS) is a throttleable ducted rocket (TDR) with an integrated nozzleless booster, designed and manufactured by Bayern-Chemie. TDR propulsion provides a long range, a high average speed, a wide operational envelope from sea level to high altitude, a flexible mission envelope via active variable thrust control, relatively simple design, and logistics similar to those of conventional solid-fuel rocket motors.

The PSS consists of four main components: a ramcombustor with integrated nozzleless booster; the air intakes; the interstage; and the sustain gas generator. The PSS forms a structural component of the missile, the gas generator and ramcombustor having steel cases. The propulsion control unit electronics are mounted in the port intake fairing, ahead of the fin actuation subsystem.

The solid propellant nozzleless booster is integrated within the ramcombustor and accelerates the missile to a velocity where the TDR can take over. The reduced smoke propellant complies with STANAG 6016.

The air intakes and the port covers which seal the intake diffusors from the ramcombustor remain closed during the boost phase. The intakes are manufactured from titanium. The interstage is mounted between the gas-generator and the ramcombustor and contains the Motor Safety Ignition Unit (MSIU), the booster igniter, and the gas generator control valve. The gas generator is ignited by the hot gases from the booster combustion which flow through the open control valve. The gas generator contains an oxygen deficient composite solid propellant which produces a hot, fuel-rich gas which auto-ignites in the air which has been decelerated and compressed by the intakes. The high energy boron-loaded propellant provides a roughly threefold increase in specific impulse compared to conventional solid rocket motors. The result yields a no-escape zone more than three times greater than that of the current AIM-120 AMRAAM used by Eurofighter Typhoon-equipped airforces.

Thrust is controlled by a valve which varies throat area of the gas generator nozzle. Reducing the throat area increases the pressure in the gas generator which increases the propellant burn rate, increasing the fuel mass flow into the ramcombustor. The mass flow can be varied continuously over a ratio greater than 10:1.

===Control===

The missile trajectory is controlled aerodynamically using four rear-mounted fins. Meteor&#x27;s control principles are intended to allow high turn rates while maintaining intake and propulsion performance.The FAS is mounted at the rear of the intake fairings. The design of the FAS is complicated by the linkages required between the actuator in the fairing and the body-mounted fins.

The fin actuation subsystem (FAS) was originally designed and manufactured by the Claverham Group, a UK based division of the US company Hamilton Sundstrand. After a short time the design was taken on board by MBDA UK, at Stevenage, but was transferred to the Spanish company SENER at an early stage of the development. SENER completed the development and certification of the FAS including the production and qualification of the prototypes.

===Datalink===
Meteor will be &quot;network-enabled&quot;. A datalink will allow the launch aircraft to provide mid-course target updates or retargeting if required, including data from offboard third parties.

The datalink electronics are mounted in the starboard intake fairing, ahead of the FAS. The antenna is mounted in the rear of the fairing.

On 19 November 1996 Bayern-Chemie completed the latest in a series of tests designed to assess the attenuation of signals by the boron rich exhaust plume of the TDR, a concern highlighted by opponents of this form of ramjet propulsion. Tests were conducted with signals transmitted through the plume at various angles. The initial results suggested that the attenuation was much less than expected.

The Eurofighter and Gripen, with two-way datalinks, allow the launch platform to provide updates on targets or re-targeting when the missile is in flight. The datalink is capable of transmitting information such as kinematic status. It also notifies target acquisition by the seeker.

===Support===
The Integrated Logistics Support concept proposed for Meteor does away with line maintenance. The missiles will be stored in dedicated containers when not in use. If the Built-In Test equipment detects a fault the missile will be returned to MBDA for repair. The Meteor is intended to have an airborne carriage life of 1,000 hours before any maintenance is required.

==Orders==

Full-scale development and production of Meteor began in 2003 with the signature of a £1.2 billion contract by the UK on behalf of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK.

The percentage share of the programme allocated to each partner nation has changed several times over the years. Germany&#x27;s decision to reduce its intended acquisition resulted in the UK taking 5% of the programme from Germany, giving the UK 39.6% and Germany 16%. France is funding 12.4%, Italy 12%, and Sweden and Spain 10% each.

An Integrated Project Team (IPT) was established at MoD Abbey Wood with representatives from all partner nations seconded to the team. The programme will be managed by the UK MoD through the IPT on behalf of the partner nations. The IJPO report to the UK Chief of Defence Procurement, the executive board of the DPA, and to an International Steering Committee comprising a one or two star representative from each partner nation&#x27;s air force.

The prime-contractor, MBDA, will manage and execute the programme through its operating companies in France, Italy, and the UK, working with Bayern-Chemie/Protac in Germany, Inmize Sistemas SL in Spain, and Saab Bofors Dynamics in Sweden. It is estimated that over 250 companies across Europe will be involved. Work will be allocated by MBDA to its risk-sharing partners on an &quot;earned value basis&quot; under which work is placed according to best commercial value, taking into account technical excellence, but with a view to aligning &quot;broadly&quot; with the share of development funding provided by each nation.

The development programme will make large use of computer simulation and so should require a relatively small number of firings, some of which will cover activities more traditionally associated with aircraft-integration trials. The first firing, from Gripen, was expected in 2005 with an in service date of August 2012.

In December 2009 the Spanish government authorized the procurement of 100 Meteor missiles and their corresponding support equipment.

In September 2010 the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, signed a production order contract with the MoD for the Meteor missile; the system is expected to be operational with the Swedish Air Force in 2015.

In May 2015, Qatar ordered 160 Meteor missiles to equip the Dassault Rafales of the Qatar Emiri Air Force.

Greek Air Force is expected to equip its Rafale fighters with Meteor missiles. The missile officially entered service in March 2023.

Egypt&#x27;s 2021 Rafale order &quot;excluded&quot; the long-range Meteor missile, even though the United States had lifted their objection to such a purchase in 2019. Reports conflict as to whether Egypt later purchased Meteors.

===Key milestones===
The UK MoD stipulated four &quot;tightly defined&quot; contractual milestones that had to be met otherwise the programme would be cancelled with MBDA expected to repay the development funding:
# To demonstrate successful transition from boost to sustain propulsion.
# To demonstrate control of the asymmetric airframe. There was concern that the intake air flow would be disrupted during manoeuvres resulting in a loss of propulsion performance or even control. The asymmetric configuration also poses unique control problems. Achievement of this milestone was to be demonstrated using computer models validated from the Air Launched Demonstrator (ALD) trials results.
# To demonstrate transfer alignment of the missile&#x27;s inertial measurement system. This process ensures that the missile knows where it is at launch. Good knowledge of initial position is essential to accurate navigation, particularly for long range engagements.
# This milestone relates to Meteor&#x27;s electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) capability. This is highly classified work to be conducted in MBDA&#x27;s hardware-in-the-loop laboratory in Rome.

Achievement of these milestones will be evaluated by QinetiQ acting as an independent auditor.

===Development===
At the 2003 Paris Air Show MBDA signed a contract with Bayern-Chemie/Protac worth in excess of EUR250m, for development, first lot production, and integrated logistics for the Meteor PSS. Also at the show, MBDA and Thales formalised their agreement of June 2002 by signing a contract for EUR46m covering development and initial production of seekers for the RAF&#x27;s missiles.

Over the eight months following contract signature, MBDA had determined the definitive external shape of Meteor. By the summer of 2003 manufacture had commenced of a full-scale model for aircraft fit checks as well as sub-scale models for wind tunnel tests scheduled for the autumn. The mid-mounted wings which had featured in the originally proposed configuration were removed. Following extensive pre-contract wind tunnel testing and MBDA&#x27;s growing experience with guidance and control technologies for wingless configurations, such as ASRAAM, a wingless design was believed to offer the best solution to meeting the performance requirements. The control fins were also redesigned so that all four fins were now identical.

In October 2003 the first trial fit of a geometrically representative model was carried out on Eurofighter. Checks were successfully carried out on the underfuselage semi-recessed, long-stroke Missile Eject Launchers and the underwing pylon-mounted rail-launchers. In November 2003 Saab Aerosystems received an order worth 435m Swedish Kronor from the FMV for the integration of Meteor onto Gripen. As prime contractor for the integration task Saab Aerosystems will be supported by Ericsson Microwave Systems, Saab Bofors Dynamics, and MBDA (UK).

In December 2003 MBDA and Saab Bofors Dynamics signed an enabling contract worth 485m kronor covering programme management, system level participation, participation in the development of seeker, guidance, and autopilot algorithms, development of missile software, development of test equipment, system proving activities, and the TBUS.

In April 2004 MBDA carried out fit checks on a Gripen at Saab&#x27;s Linköping facility. This demonstrated the mechanical interfaces between the missile, the Multi-Missile Launcher (MML) and the aircraft. Wind tunnel tests had recently been completed at BAE Systems&#x27; facility at Warton, UK, and at ONERA in Modane, France. These tests successfully demonstrated the air intake operation and validated the modelled aerodynamic characteristics, confirming the configuration for the first flight trials.

In August 2004 Bayern-Chemie delivered the first inert PSS, to be used for structural testing, amongst other things.

By the summer of 2005 two inert missiles had been delivered to Modane to recommission the facility following major modifications intended to prepare it for the free-jet trials. These were planned to begin with a &#x27;part-firing&#x27; before the French summer holidays to be followed by two full-scale firings later in the year. These would comprise a full end-to-end demonstration of the complete propulsion system at representative supersonic free flight conditions as a risk reduction exercise for the ALD firings, scheduled for the last quarter of 2005. During these tests a full-scale missile model fitted with a live PSS would be mounted on a moveable strut in the wind tunnel, allowing a series of incidence and sideslip manoeuvres to be conducted over the full duration of the PSS operation. The tests would demonstrate operation of the air intakes, the transition from boost to sustain propulsion, control of the sustain motor thrust, and provide data on the aerodynamic characteristics.

On 9 September 2005 the first flight of Meteor on board a French Navy F2 standard Rafale M was successfully carried out from Istres, France. This was in preparation for a week-long series of trials from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle which commenced on 11 December 2005. Tests were carried out with two Ground Handling Training Missiles (GHTM) and an Environmental Data Gathering (EDG) missile fitted alternatively on an underwing rail-launcher or underfuselage eject launchers. The EDG is an instrumented missile representing all the dynamic properties of an operational missile in terms of size, weight, and aerodynamic shape. The trials were designed to measure the shock and vibration levels associated with the severe carrier operational environment. Around twenty catapult launches and full deck arrests were undertaken, along with a number of touch and go landings on the fightdeck to provide a fully comprehensive handling test of the aircraft while fitted with Meteor. The trials went so well that they were concluded a day earlier than planned.

On 13 December a separate campaign commenced in Sweden with flights of the Meteor avionics missile (GMA5) carried on the port wing outboard station of Gripen aircraft 39.101, which had been modified with Meteor-unique software. As with the EDG missile GMA5 represents all the dynamic properties of an operational missile but also interfaces electrically with the launch aircraft. These trials successfully verified mechanical, electrical, and functional interfaces between the missile and aircraft. This was the first in-flight trial of two-way communication between the missile and aircraft and was an important step in clearing the aircraft and missile for the ALD firings which had slipped into Spring 2006, due to the lack of winter daylight hours at the Vidsel Test Range in northern Sweden.

In a separate air-carry trial a Eurofighter of No. 17 (R) squadron RAF flew with two GHTMs on the forward underfuselage stations to assess how the aircraft handled during a series of manoeuvres.

On 21 January 2006 a range work-up was conducted at Vidsel, again with GMA5 mounted on 39.101. This successfully verified system communications and set-up between the aircraft and the test range in advance of the first firing.

The first ALD firing took place on 9 May 2006 from a JAS 39 Gripen flying at an altitude of 7,000 m. The missile was launched from the port underwing MML, separating safely from the launch aircraft as the integrated booster accelerated the missile to over Mach 2.0 in around two seconds. However, after a successful boost the missile failed to transition to the sustain phase of flight. The missile continued under boost impulse, gradually decelerating until broken up, on command from the ground. Despite this problem telemetry was gathered throughout the full duration of the flight. The missile debris was recovered and the air intakes were found to be still closed.

The problem was traced to a timing issue in the gas generator valve control unit software, which was developed by a Bayern-Chemie subcontractor. Following modification a repeat of the first trial took place on 20 May 2006 and was a complete success. During the sustain phase the missile carried out a series of pre-programmed manoeuvres, under autopilot control, representative of the mid-course and endgame phases of an engagement. The flight lasted just under a minute and ended again with the successful operation of the break-up system which destroyed the missile within the range boundary.

The first trial of a flight standard functional seeker was carried out on 30 June 2006. The Seeker Data Gathering (SDG) missile was carried under the wing of Gripen. The SDG missile has no propulsion system or warhead but contains operational missile subsystems and telemetry systems. The flight lasted approximately 1.5 hours, allowing data to be gathered over a variety of different flight conditions. These data will be used in support of the third Key Milestone. This marked the start of a two-year seeker development programme which will conclude with the first guided firing, currently scheduled for 2008 from Gripen. This programme will gather clutter data and demonstrate capabilities such as transfer alignment and target tracking in clear air and in the presence of ECM.

On 5 September 2006 the third and final ALD firing was successfully conducted. The launch conditions were the same as the first two firings but the missile flew a different flight profile.

The UK NAO Major Projects Report 2006 reported a 12-month delay in the Meteor programme, pushing the expected in service date back to August 2013. The Chief of Defence Procurement was reported as saying that this was nothing to do with the missile itself, &quot;Meteor is actually going very well.&quot; and the lack of Eurofighter aircraft for the integration work was the main reason for the slip. The Minister of Defence Procurement, Lord Drayson, said &quot;I regard this as a Eurofighter Gmbh problem.&quot; It was reported that this delay could lead to the RAF operating AMRAAM to a point where stocks of airworthy missiles become low.

On 28 April 2015, French Ministry Of Defense, Dassault Aviation and MBDA proceeded with the first guided launch of a Meteor from the Dassault Rafale against an aerial target. The test, performed by a Rafale flying from the DGA Essais en Vol site at Cazaux, was successfully completed in a zone of the DGA Essais de Missiles site of Biscarrosse.

On 21 April 2017, the UK government signed a £41 million contract with MBDA to integrate Meteor on Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons and the F-35B Lightning IIs. On 10 December 2018, RAF Typhoons flew their first active mission with Meteor missiles.

On 2 July 2018, MBDA opened a new facility in Bolton, England to carry out final assembly for all six European partner nations.

On 30 August 2022, Saab announced its first firing of the MBDA Meteor with an Gripen E, at an altitude of 16,500 ft over the Vidsel Test Range in northern Sweden “in late May/early June”.

===Future===
MBDA is planning integration of Meteor on the F-35 by 2027 for the UK and Italian Air Forces. The Meteor has already been checked for fit in the internal weapons bays of the JSF. It is compatible with the aircraft&#x27;s internal air-to-ground stations, but requires a different fin shape to be compatible with the air-to-air stations that will be fitted as a &quot;role change kit&quot;.

India enquired whether the Meteor could be integrated with their Sukhoi Su-30MKI and HAL Tejas fleets, however this was refused.

====Joint New Air-to-Air Missile====
On 17 July 2014, MBDA UK agreed to jointly research a Meteor-derived missile with Japan.
A spokesman from the Ministry of Defense (Japan) confirmed on 14 January 2016 that, Japan and the United Kingdom will develop a Joint New Air-to-Air Missile (JNAAM) by &quot;combining the UK&#x27;s missile-related technologies and Japanese seeker technologies&quot;. The active electronically scanned array seeker of the Mitsubishi Electric AAM-4B would be mounted on the Meteor, because the AAM-4B is too large to be carried in the Japanese F-35 weapons bay.

According to the Japanese Ministry of Defense, the seeker will be made of gallium nitride modules to reconcile both miniaturization and performance enhancement and planned to carry out the first launch test with a British fighter jet by 2023. A Janes report Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Defense (MoD) has asked its Ministry of Finance in Tokyo for JPY1.2 billion (US$11.4 million) to push ahead with the co-development of the JNAAM with the United Kingdom.

<doc id="305399" wikidata="Q337238" url="?curid=305399" title="Porphyry (geology)">
<text>Porphyry ( ) is any of various granites or igneous rocks with coarse-grained crystals such as feldspar or quartz dispersed in a fine-grained silicate-rich, generally aphanitic matrix or groundmass. In its non-geologic, traditional use, the term &quot;porphyry&quot; usually refers to the purple-red form of this stone, valued for its appearance, but other colours of decorative porphyry are also used such as &quot;green&quot;, &quot;black&quot; and &quot;grey&quot;.

The term &quot;porphyry&quot; is from the Ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;purple&quot;. Purple was the colour of royalty, and the Roman &quot;imperial porphyry&quot; was a deep purple igneous rock with large crystals of plagioclase. Some authors claimed the rock was the hardest known in antiquity. Thus porphyry was prized for monuments and building projects in Imperial Rome and thereafter.

Subsequently, the name was given to any igneous rocks with large crystals. The adjective &quot;porphyritic&quot; now refers to a certain texture of igneous rock regardless of its chemical and mineralogical composition or its color. Its chief characteristic is a large difference in size between the tiny matrix crystals and the much larger phenocrysts. Porphyries may be aphanites or phanerites, that is, the groundmass may have microscopic crystals as in basalt, or crystals easily distinguishable with the eye, as in granite.

==Formation==
Most igneous rocks have some degree of porphyritic texture. This is because most magma from which igneous rock solidifies is produced by partial melting of a mixture of different minerals. At first the mixed melt slowly cools deep in the crust. The magma begins crystallizing, the highest melting point minerals closest to the overall composition first, in a process called fractional crystallization. This forms phenocrysts, which usually have plenty of room for growth, and form large, well-shaped crystals with characteristic crystal faces (euhedral crystals). If they are different in density to the remaining melt, these phenocrysts usually settle out of solution, eventually creating cumulates; however if the partially crystallized magma is then erupted to the surface as a lava, the remainder of the melt is quickly cooled around the phenocrysts and crystallizes much more rapidly to form a very fine-grained or glassy matrix.

Porphyry can also form even from magma that completely solidifies while still underground. The groundmass will be visibly crystalline, though not as large as the phenocrysts. The crystallization of the phenocrysts during fractional crystallization changes the composition of the remaining liquid magma, moving it closer to the eutectic point, with a mixed composition of minerals. As the temperature continues to decrease, this point is reached, and the rock is entirely solidified. The simultaneous crystallization of the remaining minerals produces the finer-grained matrix surrounding the phenocrysts, as they crowd each other out.

The significance of porphyritic texture as an indication that magma forms through different stages of cooling was first recognized by the Canadian geologist, Norman L. Bowen, in 1928.

Porphyritic texture is particularly common in andesite, with the most prominent phenocrysts typically composed of plagioclase feldspar. Plagioclase has almost the same density as basaltic magma, so plagioclase phenocrysts are likely to remain suspended in the magma rather than settling out.

===Rhomb porphyry===
Rhomb porphyry is a volcanic rock with gray-white large porphyritic rhombus-shaped phenocrysts of feldspar (commonly anorthoclase) embedded in a very fine-grained red-brown matrix. The composition of rhomb porphyry places it in the trachyte–latite classification of the QAPF diagram.

Rhomb porphyry is found in continental rift areas, including the East African Rift (including Mount Kilimanjaro), Mount Erebus near the Ross Sea in Antarctica, the Oslo graben in Norway, and south-central British Columbia.

==Use in art and architecture==

===Antiquity and Byzantium===
To the Romans it was known as &quot;Lapis porphyrites&quot;. Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (36, 11) affirmed that the &quot;Imperial Porphyry&quot; had been discovered in Egypt during the reign of Tiberius; an inscription recently discovered and dated from AD 18 mentions the Roman Caius Cominius Leugas as the finder of this new quarry.
Ancient Egyptians used other decorative porphyritic stones of a very close composition and appearance, but apparently remained unaware of the presence of the Roman grade although it was located in their own country. It was also sometimes used in Minoan art, and as early as 1850 BC on Crete in Minoan Knossos there were large column bases made of porphyry.

It was called &quot;Imperial&quot; as the mines, as elsewhere in the empire, were owned by the emperor. The red porphyry all came from the Gabal Abu Dukhan quarry (or &quot;Mons Porphyrites&quot;) in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, from 600 million-year-old andesite of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. The road from the quarry westward to Qena (Roman Maximianopolis) on the Nile, which Ptolemy put on his second-century map, was first described by Strabo, and it is to this day known as the &quot;Via Porphyrites&quot;, the Porphyry Road, its track marked by the hydreumata, or watering wells that made it viable in this utterly dry landscape. It was used for all the red porphyry columns in Rome, the togas on busts of emperors, the panels in the revetment of the Pantheon, the Column of Constantine in Istanbul as well as the altars and vases and fountain basins reused in the Renaissance and dispersed as far as Kyiv.

The Romans also used &quot;Green Porphyry&quot; (&quot;lapis Lacedaemonius&quot;, from Greece, also known today as Serpentine), and &quot;Black Porphyry&quot; from the same Egyptian quarry.

After the fifth century the quarry was lost to sight for many centuries. Byzantium scholar Alexander Vasiliev suggested this was the consequence of the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and the subsequent troubles in Egypt. The scientific members of the French Expedition under Napoleon sought it in vain, and it was only when the Eastern Desert was reopened for study under Muhammad Ali that the site was rediscovered by the English Egyptologists James Burton and John Gardner Wilkinson in 1823.

Porphyry was extensively used in Byzantine imperial monuments, for example in Hagia Sophia and in the &quot;Porphyra&quot;, the official delivery room for use of pregnant Empresses in the Great Palace of Constantinople, giving rise to the phrase &quot;born in the purple&quot;.

Choosing porphyry as a material was a bold and specific statement for late Imperial Rome. As if it were not enough that porphyry was explicitly for imperial use, the stone&#x27;s rarity set the emperors apart from their subjects as their superiors. The comparative vividness of porphyry to other stones underscored that these figures were not regular citizens, but many levels above, even gods, and worthy of the respect they expected. Porphyry made the emperors unapproachable in terms of power and nature, belonging to another world, the world of the mighty gods, present for a short time on earth.

Porphyry also stood in for the physical purple robes Roman emperors wore to show status, because of its purple colouring. Similar to porphyry, purple fabric was extremely difficult to make, as what we now call Tyrian purple required the use of rare sea snails to make the dye. The colour itself reminded the public how to behave in the presence of the emperors, with respect bordering on worship for the self-proclaimed god-kings.

===Roman and late Roman imperial sarcophagi===
A uniquely prestigious use of porphyry was its choice as material for imperial sarcophagi in the 4th and early 5th centuries. That tradition appears to have been started with Diocletian&#x27;s porphyry sarcophagus in his mausoleum, which was destroyed when the building was repurposed as a church but of which probable fragments are at the Archaeological Museum in Split, Croatia. The oldest and best-preserved ones are now conserved at the Vatican Museums and known as the Sarcophagi of Helena and Constantina.

Nine other imperial porphyry sarcophagi were long held in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. They were described by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in the &quot;De Ceremoniis&quot; (mid-10th century), who specified them to be respectively of Constantine the Great, Constantius II, Julian, Jovian, Theodosius I, Arcadius, Aelia Eudoxia, Theodosius II, and Marcian. Of these, most still exist in complete or fragmentary form, despite depredations by later Byzantine Emperors, Crusaders, and Ottoman conquerors. Four presently adorn the facade of the main building of the İstanbul Archaeology Museums, including one whose rounded shape led Alexander Vasiliev to suggest attribution to Emperor Julian on the basis of Constantine Porphyrogenitus&#x27;s description. Vasiliev conjectures that the nine imperial sarcophagi, including one which carries a &quot;crux ansata&quot; or Egyptian cross, were carved in Egypt before shipment to Constantinople.

===Porphyry sarcophagi in post-Roman Western Europe===
The imperial porphyry sarcophagi tradition was emulated by Ostrogothic King Theodoric the Great (454-526), whose mausoleum in Ravenna still contains a porphyry tub that was used as his sarcophagus. Similarly Charles the Bald, King of West Francia and Roman Emperor, was buried at Saint-Denis in a porphyry tub which may be the same one known as &quot;Dagobert&#x27;s tub&quot; (&quot;cuve de Dagobert&quot;), now in the Louvre.

The tomb of Peter III of Aragon, in the Monastery of Santes Creus near Tarragona, reuses a porphyry tub or &quot;alveus&quot;, which has been conjectured to be originally the sarcophagus of Late Roman Emperor Constans in his mausoleum at Centcelles, a nearby site with a well-preserved 4th-century rotunda.

In twelfth- and thirteenth-century Sicily, another group of porphyry sarcophagi were produced from the reign of Roger II onward and used for Royal and then Imperial burials, namely those of King Roger II, King William I, Emperor Henry VI, Empress Constance, and Emperor Frederick II. They are all now in the Palermo Cathedral, except William&#x27;s in Monreale Cathedral. Scholar Rosa Bacile argues that they were carved by a local workshop from porphyry imported from Rome, the latter four plausibly (based on observation of their fluting) all from a single column shaft that may have been taken from the Baths of Caracalla or the Baths of Diocletian. She notes that these Sicilian porphyry sarcophagi &quot;are the very first examples of medieval free-standing secular tombs in the West, and therefore play a unique role within the history of Italian sepulchral art (earlier and later tombs are adjacent to, and dependent on walls).&quot;

Six grand porphyry sarcophagi are featured along the walls of the octagonal &quot;Cappella dei Principi&quot; (Chapel of the Princes) that was built as one of two chapels in the architectural complex of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, in Florence, Italy, for the de&#x27; Medici family. Purple porphyry was used lavishly throughout the opulent chapel as well, with a revetment of marbles, inlaid with other colored marbles and semi-precious stone, that covers the walls completely. Envisioned by Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1537–1574), it was initiated by Ferdinand I de&#x27; Medici, following a design by Matteo Nigetti that won an informal competition held in 1602 by Don Giovanni de&#x27; Medici (a son of Cosimo I), which was altered somewhat during execution by Buontalenti.

The tomb of Napoleon at Les Invalides in Paris, designed by architect Louis Visconti, is centered on the deceased emperor&#x27;s sarcophagus that often has been described as made of red porphyry although this is incorrect. Napoleon&#x27;s sarcophagus is made of quartzite, however, its pedestal is made of green andesite porphyry from Vosges. The sarcophagus of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral was completed in 1858. and was made from a single piece of Cornish porphyry, of a type called luxullianite, which was found in a field near Lostwithiel.

==Modern uses==
In countries where many automobiles have studded winter tires such as Sweden, Finland, and Norway, it is common that highways are paved with asphalt made of porphyry aggregate to make the wearing course and withstand the extreme wear from the spiked winter tires.

<text>La Mancha () is a natural and historical region in the Spanish provinces of Albacete, Cuenca, Ciudad Real and Toledo. It is a fertile plateau (610 m or 2000 ft) that stretches from the mountains of Toledo to the western spurs of the Cuenca hills, bordered to the south by the Sierra Morena and to the north by the Alcarria. The La Mancha historical comarca constitutes the southern portion of Castilla-La Mancha autonomous community and makes up most of the present-day administrative region.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;La Mancha&quot; is probably derived from the Arabic word المنشأ &quot;al-mansha&quot;, meaning &quot;land without water&quot;. The name of the city of Almansa in Albacete shares that origin. The name describes the region&#x27;s dryland farming soils.

Another etymology ascribes the origin of &quot;La Mancha&quot; to المانيا &quot;al-manya&quot;, which is an Arabic expression for &quot;elevated plain&quot; or &quot;high plateau&quot;.

The word &quot;mancha&quot; in Spanish literally means &quot;spot&quot;, &quot;stain&quot;, or &quot;patch&quot;. Unless the scarce or &quot;patchy&quot; vegetation cover is considered, no apparent link exists between the Spanish false cognate &quot;mancha&quot; and the name of the region.

Besides phonetic similarity, there is no relationship between the toponym &quot;La Mancha&quot; and the French thalassonym &quot;La Manche&quot;, which refers to the English Channel and denotes the sleeve-shaped form of that stretch of sea. However,
&quot;Canal de la Mancha&quot; is the Spanish name for the English Channel, and &quot;manga&quot; is the Spanish word for sleeve.

==Geography==

The largest plain in Spain, La Mancha is made up of a plateau averaging 500 to 600 metres in altitude (although it reaches 900 metres in Campo de Montiel and other parts), centering on the province of Ciudad Real. The region is watered by the Guadiana, Jabalón, Záncara, Cigüela, and Júcar rivers.
==Climate==
The climate is cold semi-arid (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), with strong fluctuations. Farming (wheat, barley, oats, sugar beets, wine grapes, olives) and cattle raising are the primary economic activities, but they are severely restricted by the harsh environmental conditions.

==Culture==
The inhabitants of La Mancha are called &quot;Manchegos&quot;.

==Agriculture==
La Mancha has always been an important agricultural zone. Viticulture is important in Tomelloso, Alcázar de San Juan, Socuéllamos, Valdepeñas, La Solana and Manzanares, in Ciudad Real and Villarrobledo in Albacete. Other crops include cereals (hence the famous windmills) and saffron. Sheep are raised and bred, providing the famous Manchego cheese, as are goats, including the La Mancha goat, one of the assumed progenitors of the American La Mancha goat.

La Mancha includes one National Park, Las Tablas de Daimiel, and one Natural Park, Las Lagunas de Ruidera.

==People==
Famous Spaniards like the cinema directors Pedro Almodóvar and José Luis Cuerda, painters Antonio López and his uncle Antonio López Torres, footballer Andrés Iniesta, music band Angelus Apatrida and actress Sara Montiel were born in La Mancha.

==La Mancha and Cervantes==
Miguel de Cervantes described La Mancha and its windmills in his two-part 1605/1615 novel &quot;Don Quixote de La Mancha&quot;. Cervantes was making fun of the region, using a pun; a &quot;mancha&quot; was also a stain, as on one&#x27;s honor, and thus an inappropriately named homeland for a dignified knight-errant. Translator John Ormsby believed that Cervantes chose it because it was the most ordinary, prosaic, anti-romantic, and therefore unlikely place from which a chivalrous, romantic hero could originate, making Quixote seem even more absurd. However, ironically, due to the fame of Cervantes&#x27; character, the name of La Mancha came to be associated worldwide with romantic chivalry.

Several film versions of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; have been filmed largely in La Mancha. However, some, including the 1957 Russian film version, and the 1972 English-language version of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (based on the 1965 Broadway musical), were not. The 1957 film was shot in Crimea, while &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; was filmed in Italy. G. W. Pabst&#x27;s 1933 version of Cervantes&#x27;s novel was shot in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. The 2000 made-for-TV &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, starring John Lithgow as Don Quixote and Bob Hoskins as Sancho Panza, was shot on several locations in Spain, but not in La Mancha.

<doc id="305404" wikidata="Q2081430" url="?curid=305404" title="Fox McCloud">
<text>is a fictional character and the chief protagonist of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Star Fox&quot; series. He is an anthropomorphic red fox created by Shigeru Miyamoto and designed by Takaya Imamura. He was introduced as the sole playable character in the original 1993 video game &quot;Star Fox&quot;. From each game, to varying extents depending on the entry, the player controls Fox in his Arwing. He is the leader of the Star Fox team and is joined by his wingmates during various missions.

Fox is the protagonist of several &quot;Star Fox&quot; games, comics, and other media. He has been featured in several other game franchises, including as a playable character in every installment of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. Fox has received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Concept and design==
In 1992, Nintendo and Argonaut Software collaborated to produce a 3D space shooter for the Super NES, provisionally titled &#x27;SnesGlider&#x27;. The development team, led by Shigeru Miyamoto, redesigned what had been a tech demo into a rail shooter, from Nintendo designing the game and Argonaut handling the programming aspects. However, without a story, it lacked any incentive to play beyond flying and shooting. Miyamoto sketched out a universe but could not decide on a natural hero to convey a sense of an epic space saga. Names under consideration included &quot;Star Wolf&quot;, &quot;Star Sheep&quot;, &quot;Star Fox&quot;, &quot;Star Sparrow&quot;, and &quot;Star Hawk&quot;. Miyamoto finally settled on having a fox as the main character after visiting Fushimi Inari-taisha in Kyoto, the head shrine of Inari, a Japanese &quot;kami&quot; associated with foxes. Inari is portrayed as being able to fly, and its shrines, particularly the one in Kyoto, are surrounded by red arches (&quot;torii&quot;), giving Miyamoto the idea of a fox that could fly through arches. His face was modeled after Inari&#x27;s, and usually wears a &quot;red turtleneck&quot; or &quot;red scarf&quot; around his neck, like the statue. Fox McCloud&#x27;s personality is heavily based on Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s personality, with the surname &#x27;McCloud&#x27; being suggested by Dylan Cuthbert, one of Argonaut&#x27;s programmers.

Fox McCloud is an anthropomorphic fox with orange-brown fur, with golden-brown or white highlights. He has a stereotypical bushy, white-tipped tail which appears to be very short in &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; and &quot;Command&quot;. His eyes are inconsistently shown to be either green or blue. He will occasionally wear large tanker boots over his legs when fighting on the ground. Takaya Imamura from the Star Fox development team noted that the anthropomorphic styling was to help players feel empathy towards the characters in Star Fox. Fox&#x27;s outfit has changed in every game he appears in, but generally includes an orange or green jumpsuit under a pale gray flight jacket or combat vest and a headset. In &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, if the game is played in expert mode, Fox wears a pair of sunglasses similar to what his father wore. Nintendo has never officially cited Fox&#x27;s age or height in a game manual, but &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; released a card featuring Fox, which stated that during &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; he is 18 years old, his height is 1.73 SM and his weight is 70.31 SK. The SNES &quot;Star Fox&quot; soundtrack booklet stated that Fox&#x27;s height is and his weight is . Fox would be 26 in &quot;Adventures&quot; (as &quot;Adventures&quot; takes place just 8 years after the events of &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;), 27 in &quot;Assault&quot; (the game manual stated 1 year had passed since the conclusion of &quot;Adventures&quot;), and 29 to 30 in &quot;Command&quot; (exactly three years right after the conclusion of &quot;Assault&quot;).

Unlike the voice actor consistency with other Nintendo characters, such as Mario, several different individuals have contributed their vocals for Fox. He was first voiced by Daniel Owsen in Star Fox, in both the English and Japanese versions of the game. His most consistent English voice actor has been Mike West, who first portrayed the character in the localized release of &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;. After a hiatus of fourteen years, West reprised the role for &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot;. He has since then consistently voiced Fox, supplying the character with his voice for &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;, &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. In both the Japanese release of &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, Fox was voiced by Shinobu Satouchi (speaking in English with a Japanese accent for the English version). For English dialogue of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; and &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot;, Fox&#x27;s voice was done by Rare&#x27;s Steve Malpass. In &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot;, his voice was done by Jim Walker in the English release and by Kenji Nojima in the Japanese release. Nojima reprised his role for &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, as did Walker for the English version. Nojima reprised his role once again in the Japanese version of &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;.

In &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot;, &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, he is voiced by Takashi Ōhara in Japanese.

There was a fan theory stating that Fox McCloud, along with other Star Fox members, had his legs amputated and replaced with metal prostheses; Cuthbert stated that the characters&#x27; legs were not amputated, and Miyamoto stated that the appearance of metal legs was a design choice rather than an indication that the legs were amputated; he wanted the character to appear more human, and was unaware of the issues faced by fighter pilots at the time.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;Star Fox&quot; series===
Fox first appears in &quot;Star Fox&quot; for the Super NES as the leader of Team Star Fox, alongside Falco, Slippy, and Peppy. He and his team face off against Andross and his empire. They also appear in &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;, a cancelled games released decades later. He and his team later appear in &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, fighting against Andross as well as Star Wolf, consisting of Wolf O&#x27;Donnell and others. In the game &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot;, Fox appears without the rest of the Star Fox team, helping Dinosaur Planet and a woman named Krystal against an attack by a man named General Scales, allying with a triceratops named Prince Tricky. Krystal falls in love with Fox, and the two fight against a resurrected Andross, the true antagonist.

In &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot;, Fox is hired to defeat Andross&#x27; nephew, Andrew Oikonny, who started a rebellion. They also face off against the Aparoid race, led by the Aparoid Queen, with assistance from Star Wolf.

Once again, the Lylat System falls under peril in &quot;Star Fox Command&quot; (2006), this time under attack by a new foe known as the Anglars, who originated from Venom&#x27;s acidic oceans. It is up to Fox McCloud to save the galaxy once more by slowly liberating invaded territory and arriving at Venom to defeat the Anglar Emperor. This time, he begins the battle with only ROB 64 at his side, as the rest of the team has been disbanded for various reasons (i.e. dismissing Krystal by fearing for her safety). Along the way, other characters will join Fox and the team becomes whole again. As &quot;Command&quot; has nine different outcomes, it is uncertain which is the true path Fox and crew take, and even whether or not &quot;Command&quot; is even canon to the series. Despite this, the developers have suggested that any sequel might ignore the endings and instead pick up the story from the middle. Fox&#x27;s vehicle is called the Arwing II, which boasts a decent amount of health and boost, and can either receive plasma blasters or twin lasers, depending on the storyline. In this game, Takaya Imamura gave Fox a cartoonish appearance, compared to the more realistic look of &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; and &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot;. According to Imamura, realistic fur was unpopular with players.

===In other media===
Outside of &quot;Star Fox&quot; series. Fox McCloud has appeared in all five &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; games as a default playable character. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, he is light, has the third-fastest dashing speed in the game, surpassed only by Captain Falcon and Sonic the Hedgehog, and has fairly weak attacks that allow for a number of combos. His attacks include a blaster, a dash attack, a hexagonal reflector (informally called the &quot;shine&quot;), the &quot;Fire Fox&quot; attack, and the Landmaster tank as a &quot;Final Smash&quot;. Falco Lombardi and Wolf O&#x27;Donnell, also from the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series, have similar movesets. In competitive &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, Fox is considered to be the character with the most potential and is utilized by numerous top players, such as Adam &quot;Armada&quot; Lindgren and Joseph &quot;Mango&quot; Marquez, although his fast movements make him very difficult to control without practice. Fox also re-appears alongside the rest of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; cast in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, and is based on his &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot; design. Unlike in &quot;Brawl&quot;, Fox&#x27;s &quot;Final Smash&quot; makes use of the Arwing vehicle instead. He also makes a playable appearance in the Nintendo Switch version of &quot;&quot;.

==Reception==
Since the release of the original &quot;Star Fox&quot;, Fox McCloud has gained a cult following. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed Fox as their 18th favorite hero, stating that while a few of his games could have been better, he has a long list of accomplishments. Early in the Nintendo 64&#x27;s lifespan, Fox McCloud ranked fifth in &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s top five best Nintendo 64 character list. He was included in &quot;GameSpot&quot;&#x27;s &quot;All Time Greatest Video Game Hero&quot; contest and reached the &quot;Round 2&quot; before losing to Link. &quot;GameDaily&quot; named Fox McCloud as the seventh top Nintendo character of all time. &quot;IGN&quot; praised Fox&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, saying that he featured some of the best texture work and modeling in the game. In their preview of &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot; editors Juan Castro and Matt Casamassina described Fox&#x27;s voice as juvenile yet tough. Fox ranked eighth on &quot;GameDaily&quot;″s Top 10 Smash Bros. characters list. In an &quot;IGN&quot; poll for voting from a list of ten Nintendo characters for favorite Nintendo character of all time, Fox came in fourth, behind Link, Mario, and Samus respectively. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; elected Fox the twelfth coolest videogame character, adding he is a combination of &quot;the heroism of Luke Skywalker, the bravado of &quot;Top Gun&quot;&#x27;s Maverick, and the foxiness of, well, a red fox&quot;. In 2012, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked him as the 30th best hero in video games. Gus Turner of &quot;Complex Networks&quot; listed Fox as the best-forgotten video game heroes. In 2021, Chris Morgan for &quot;Yardbarker&quot; described Fox as one of &quot;the most memorable characters from old school Nintendo games&quot;.

In 2018, Fox was noted as the character that was used by the player &quot;ZD&quot;, who won the first tournament of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. Jeremy Parish of &quot;Polygon&quot; ranked 73 fighters from &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; &quot;from garbage to glorious&quot;, criticizing and listing Fox as 41st, stating that &quot;Fox (no items/Final Destination) has become an enduring symbol of how far Smash enthusiasts have to bend over backward to bring the series to something resembling acceptable balance by the standards of the fighting game community. That&#x27;s not really the character&#x27;s fault. But, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that if you pick Fox as your main, you&#x27;re a cop&quot;, while Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Fox as 60th of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; characters, criticizing and stated that &quot;it&#x27;s the guy synonymous with esports Smash, which is the boring kind of Smash, so he&#x27;s getting this spot on the list&quot;.

<doc id="305405" wikidata="Q1352521" url="?curid=305405" title="Extrusive rock">
<text>Extrusive rock refers to the mode of igneous volcanic rock formation in which hot magma from inside the Earth flows out (extrudes) onto the surface as lava or explodes violently into the atmosphere to fall back as pyroclastics or tuff. In contrast, intrusive rock refers to rocks formed by magma which cools below the surface.

The main effect of extrusion is that the magma can cool much more quickly in the open air or under seawater, and there is little time for the growth of crystals. Sometimes, a residual portion of the matrix fails to crystallize at all, instead becoming a natural glass like obsidian. 

If the magma contains abundant volatile components which are released as free gas, then it may cool with large or small vesicles (bubble-shaped cavities) such as in pumice, scoria, or vesicular basalt. Other examples of extrusive rocks are rhyolite and andesite.

== Texture ==
The texture of extrusive rocks is characterized by fine-grained crystals indistinguishable to the human eye, described as aphantic. Crystals in aphantic rocks are small in size due to their rapid formation during eruption. Any larger crystals visible to the human eye, called phenocrysts, form earlier while slowly cooling in the magma reservoir. When igneous rocks contain two distinct grain sizes, the texture is porphyritic, and the finer crystals are called the groundmass. The extrusive rocks scoria and pumice have a vesicular, bubble-like, texture due to the presence of vapor bubbles trapped in the magma.

== Extrusive bodies and rock types ==
Shield volcanoes are large, slow forming volcanoes that erupt fluid basaltic magma that cools to form the extrusive rock basalt. Basalt is composed of minerals readily available in the planet&#x27;s crust, including feldspars and pyroxenes.

Fissure volcanoes pour out low viscosity basaltic magma from fissure vents to form the extrusive rock basalt.

Composite or stratovolcanoes often have andesitic magma and typically form the extrusive rock andesite. Andesitic magma is composed of many gases and melted mantle rocks.

Cinder or scoria cones violently expel lava with high gas content, and due to the vapor bubbles in this mafic lava, the extrusive basalt scoria is formed.

Lava domes are formed by high viscosity lava that piles up, forming a dome shape. Domes typically solidify to form the rich in silica extrusive rock obsidian and sometimes dacite domes form the extrusive rock dacite, like in the case of Mount St. Helens.

Calderas are volcanic depressions formed after an erupted volcano collapses. Resurgent calderas can refill with an eruption of rhyolitic magma to form the extrusive rock rhyolite like the Yellowstone Caldera.

Submarine volcanoes erupt on the ocean floor and produce the extrusive rock pumice. Pumice is a light-weight glass with a vesicular texture that differs from scoria in its silicic composition and therefore floats.

<doc id="305413" wikidata="Q335239" url="?curid=305413" title="Amphibolite">
<text>Amphibolite () is a metamorphic rock that contains amphibole, especially hornblende and actinolite, as well as plagioclase feldspar, but with little or no quartz. It is typically dark-colored and dense, with a weakly foliated or schistose (flaky) structure. The small flakes of black and white in the rock often give it a salt-and-pepper appearance.

Amphibolite frequently forms by metamorphism of mafic igneous rocks, such as basalt. However, because metamorphism creates minerals entirely based upon the chemistry of the protolith, certain &#x27;dirty marls&#x27; and volcanic sediments may also metamorphose to an amphibolite assemblage. Deposits containing dolomite and siderite also readily yield amphibolite (tremolite-schist, grunerite-schist, and others) especially where there has been a certain amount of contact metamorphism by adjacent granitic masses. Metamorphosed basalt (metabasalt) creates &quot;ortho-amphibolite&quot; and other chemically appropriate lithologies create &quot;para-amphibolite&quot;.

Although tremolite is a metamorphic amphibole, it is most commonly derived from highly metamorphosed ultramafic rocks, and thus tremolite-talc schist is not generally considered a variety of amphibolite. A holocrystalline plutonic igneous rock composed primarily of hornblende amphibole is called a hornblendite, which is usually a crystal cumulate rock. Igneous rocks with greater than 90% amphiboles, which have a feldspar groundmass, may be lamprophyres.

==Ortho-amphibolite vs. para-amphibolite==
Metamorphic rocks composed primarily of amphibole, plagioclase, with subordinate epidote, zoisite, chlorite, quartz, titanite, and accessory leucoxene, ilmenite and magnetite which have a protolith of an igneous rock are known as &quot;ortho-amphibolite&quot;.

&quot;Para-amphibolite&quot; will generally have the same equilibrium mineral assemblage as ortho-amphibolite, with more biotite, and may include more quartz, plagioclase, and depending on the protolith, more calcite/aragonite and wollastonite.

Often the easiest way to determine the true nature of an amphibolite is to inspect its field relationships; especially whether it is interfingered with other metasedimentary rocks, especially greywacke and other poorly sorted sedimentary rocks. If the amphibolite appears to transgress apparent protolith bedding surfaces it is an ortho-amphibolite, as this suggests it was a dyke. Picking a sill and thin metamorphosed lava flows may be more troublesome.

Thereafter, whole rock geochemistry will suitably identify ortho- from para-amphibolite.

The word &quot;metabasalt&quot; was thus coined, largely to avoid the confusion between ortho-amphibolite and para-amphibolite. This term is recommended by the British Geological Survey when it is possible to determine the origin of the rock from its characteristics alone (and not from field relationships), particularly when the degree of metamorphism is low.

==Amphibolite facies==
Amphibolite as a rock defines a particular set of temperature and pressure conditions known as the &quot;amphibolite facies&quot;. However, caution must be applied here before embarking on metamorphic mapping based on amphibolite alone.

First, for an ortho-amphibolite or amphibolite to be classed as a metamorphic amphibolite, it must be certain that the amphibole in the rock is a prograde metamorphic product, and not a retrograde metamorphic product. For instance, actinolite amphibole is a common product of retrograde metamorphism of metabasalt at (upper) greenschist facies conditions. Often, this will take on the crystal form and habit of the original protolith assemblage; actinolite pseudomorphically replacing pyroxene is an indication that the amphibolite may not represent a peak metamorphic grade in the amphibolite facies. 

Actinolite schist is often the result of hydrothermal alteration or metasomatism, and thus may not, necessarily, be a good indicator of metamorphic conditions when taken in isolation.

Second, the microstructure and crystal size of the rock must be appropriate. Amphibolite facies conditions are experienced at temperatures in excess of 500 °C and pressures less than 1.2 GPa, well within the ductile deformation field. Gneissic texture may occur nearby, if not then mylonite zones, foliations and ductile behaviour, including stretching lineations may occur.

While it is not impossible to have remnant protolith mineralogy, this is rare. More common is to find phenocrysts of pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase and even magmatic amphibole such as pargasite rhombohedra, pseudomorphed by hornblende amphibole. Original magmatic textures, especially crude magmatic layering in layered intrusions, is often preserved.

Amphibolite facies equilibrium mineral assemblages of various protolith rock types consist of:

* Basalt ortho-amphibolite; hornblende/actinolite +/- albite +/- biotite +/- quartz +/- accessories; often remnant greenschist facies assemblages including, notably, chlorite
* High-magnesia basalt; as ortho-amphibolite, but may contain anthophyllite, a Mg-rich amphibole
* Ultramafic rocks; tremolite, asbestiform amphibole, talc, pyroxene, wollastonite, prograde metamorphic olivine (rarely)
* Sedimentary para-amphibolite; hornblende/actinolite +/- albite +/- biotite +/- quartz +/- garnet (calcite +/- wollastonite)
* Pelite; quartz, orthoclase +/- albite, +/- biotite +/- actinolite +/- garnet +/- staurolite +/- sillimanite

Amphibolite facies is usually a product of &quot;Barrovian Facies Sequence&quot; or advanced &quot;Abukuma Facies Sequence&quot; metamorphic trajectories. Amphibolite facies is a result of continuing burial and thermal heating after greenschist facies is exceeded. Further burial and metamorphic compression (but little extra heat) will lead to eclogite facies metamorphism; with more advanced heating the majority of rocks begin melting in excess of 650 to 700 °C in the presence of water. In dry rocks, however, additional heat (and burial) may result in granulite facies conditions.

===Uralite===
Uralite is a particular hydrothermally altered pyroxenite; during autogenic hydrothermal circulation the primary mineralogy of pyroxene and plagioclase, etc. has altered to actinolite and saussurite (albite + epidote). The texture is distinctive, the pyroxene altered to fuzzy, radially arranged actinolite pseudomorphically after pyroxene, and saussuritised plagioclase.

===Epidiorite===
The archaic term &quot;epidiorite&quot; is sometimes used, especially in Europe, to refer to a metamorphosed ortho-amphibolite with a protolith of diorite, gabbro or other mafic intrusive rock. In epidiorite the original clinopyroxene (most often augite) has been replaced by the fibrous amphibole &quot;uralite&quot;.

==Uses==
Amphibolite was a favourite material for the production of adzes (shoe-last-celts) in the central European early Neolithic (Linearbandkeramic and Rössen cultures).

Amphibolite is a common dimension stone used in construction, paving, facing of buildings, especially because of its attractive textures, dark color, hardness and polishability and its ready availability.

<text>The feldspathoids are a group of tectosilicate minerals which resemble feldspars but have a different structure and much lower silica content. They occur in rare and unusual types of igneous rocks, and are usually not found in rocks containing primary quartz. A notable exception where feldspathoids and quartz-bearing rocks are found together is the Red Hill Syenite.

Foid, a contraction of the term &quot;feldspathoid&quot;, is applied to any igneous rock containing up to 60% modal feldspathoid minerals. For example, a syenite with significant nepheline present can be termed a &quot;nepheline-bearing syenite&quot; or &quot;nepheline syenite&quot;, with the term &quot;nepheline&quot; replaceable by any foid mineral. Such terminology is used in the Streckeisen (QAPF) classification of igneous rocks.

<text>Jake E. Lee (born Jakey Lou Williams; February 15, 1957) is an American musician best known as lead guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne between 1982 and 1987 and later as a member of the heavy metal band Badlands with Ray Gillen. He formed the band Red Dragon Cartel in 2013, and their debut album released in January 2014 entered the Billboard Album Chart at number 69. He has also recorded solo works under his own name—examples being the instrumental album &quot;A Fine Pink Mist&quot; (1996) and cover album &quot;Retraced&quot; (2005).

==Early life==
Lee was born in Norfolk, Virginia and grew up in San Diego, where the family relocated to when he was a child. His father is of Welsh ancestry and his mother is of Japanese ancestry. He was encouraged by his mother to take classical piano lessons when he was approximately six years old. He had little interest in piano, but at the age of thirteen Lee began playing a guitar belonging to his older sister and became increasingly interested in learning the instrument. In his early teens, he was introduced to the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath, and Led Zeppelin by way of his older sister&#x27;s record collection, and this music greatly influenced his guitar playing. The first song he learned was &quot;No Time&quot; by The Guess Who. From there, he learned from a Mel Bay guitar method book and used his knowledge of music theory from his piano training to become proficient at guitar. He subsequently played in several high school bands, soon impressing fellow San Diego musicians with his style of playing.

== Career ==
===Early career===
In San Diego, Lee formed a band called Teaser, named after Tommy Bolin&#x27;s debut solo album. Teaser would become the house band at a San Diego all-ages club called Straita Head Sound. In 1980, Lee joined a local heavy metal band called Mickey Ratt, who soon shortened their name to Ratt and relocated to the Sunset Strip of Los Angeles. They released the single &quot;Dr. Rock&quot;/&quot;Drivin on E,&quot; which was given away for free to fans at their live shows. The song &quot;Tell the World&quot; was included on the original pressing of the first &quot;Metal Massacre&quot; compilation album in 1982, a highly influential album which also featured the first recording from Metallica.

Not long after arriving in Los Angeles, Lee left Ratt to join a glam metal band called Sexist, reuniting with childhood friend and fellow guitarist Doug Pittam. Approximately eight months later, Lee received an offer to join Rough Cutt after being recommended by drummer and former Ratt bandmate Dave Alford in late 1982.

Former Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio was putting together a solo project with Jimmy Bain and Vinny Appice and was impressed with Lee after seeing a Rough Cutt show in Los Angeles, and invited the guitarist to join. Though Lee had believed Rough Cutt&#x27;s future was promising, he felt the offer to join Dio was too good to pass up, though his time in the band would ultimately be short-lived. According to Appice, there were rehearsals with Lee, and recordings of those rehearsals still exist, but nothing more came from this first version of the band. Lee claims that Dio wanted him to play &quot;simple block chords that wouldn&#x27;t trample on his vocals&quot; and cited creative differences for the split.

===Ozzy Osbourne===
When Ozzy Osbourne sought a replacement for guitarist Brad Gillis, Los Angeles bassist Dana Strum recommended Lee for the job. After auditioning, Osbourne was torn between Lee and Dokken guitarist George Lynch. Osbourne initially chose Lynch, but quickly changed his mind. Upon telling Lee he had the job, he then informed the guitarist that he had to tell Lynch he was fired.

With bassist Bob Daisley, Lee subsequently began composing music and recording the 1983 album &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot;. The songs &quot;So Tired&quot; and &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot; were released as singles, with accompanying videos, and they received regular airplay on MTV and radio. To date, the album has sold three million copies in the U.S. Though Lee had composed a significant amount of the album&#x27;s music, he was allegedly cheated out of his writing and publishing claims by Osbourne&#x27;s wife and manager, Sharon. Lee claims that after he had composed the songs and completed recording his parts in the studio, he was presented with a contract which stated that he would have no claim to any writing or publishing relating to the album. The contract also stated that Lee could not speak publicly about the matter. He claims he signed the contract because he had no legal representation and because Sharon threatened to fire him and have another guitarist re-record his parts if he refused.

Osbourne left the Betty Ford Center in 1985 where he had received treatment for substance abuse, and upon his return, Lee presented him with the music he had written. Osbourne was purportedly very satisfied with the quantity and quality of Lee&#x27;s new music, much of which would be used for the 1986 album &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot;. This time, however, Lee refused to contribute anything until he had a contract guaranteeing his writing credit and publishing rights. The album was awarded platinum status in May 1986 and was awarded double platinum status in October 1994. Lee and Osbourne once again toured extensively, this time with Phil Soussan on bass, John Sinclair on keyboards and Randy Castillo on drums. In Kansas City, Missouri on April 1, 1986, a concert was filmed which would be released later that year as the home video &quot;The Ultimate Ozzy&quot;.

In 1987, after touring with Ozzy Osbourne in support of the album &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot;, Lee was fired suddenly via telephone by Sharon Osbourne. Lee was caught off guard by the firing, having been under the impression that he had a solid working relationship with Ozzy. Regarding Lee&#x27;s firing, Osbourne has said that he had no personal issues with the guitarist whatsoever, but claimed that the dismissal happened after drummer Randy Castillo &quot;began to turn against&quot; Lee. Lee himself has said that bassist Phil Soussan was trying to convince Osbourne to let him be the band&#x27;s primary songwriter while also discouraging him from using Lee&#x27;s material, and that Soussan was &quot;partly instrumental in getting me fired&quot;.

While appearing on &quot;That Metal Show&quot; on VH1 Classic, Jake E. Lee claimed he wrote &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot; for which Ozzy Osbourne claimed credit, along with the rest of that album. Lee and Daisley were properly credited for their writing on &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; album.

===Badlands===
After being fired from Ozzy&#x27;s band, Lee formed the blues-based hard rock band Badlands with vocalist Ray Gillen in 1988. Badlands consisted of Lee, Gillen, drummer Eric Singer, and bassist Greg Chaisson. The band released their self-titled debut album in 1989. In 1991, Singer left Badlands to join KISS following the death of longtime drummer Eric Carr. Badlands then released the follow-up album &quot;Voodoo Highway&quot;. During a tour between that album and the upcoming third album they were ready to begin recording, Gillen left the band and was briefly replaced by John West. Gillen later died of AIDS-related complications in 1993. In 1998, &quot;Dusk&quot;, the final Badlands album consisting of unreleased live in-studio 24-track demos was released in Japan; a European release followed in 2000.

Following the demise of Badlands, Lee opted for a radical musical departure and teamed with World War III vocalist Mandy Lion in a new band called Wicked Alliance. The initial line-up also featured future Korn drummer Ray Luzier and bassist Jimmy Bain who was replaced with Brian Perry, formerly of Dirty Looks and Lizzy Borden, in time for the band&#x27;s one and only U.S. tour in early 1994. The band also cut a three-song demo with Joe Floyd of Warrior at Silver Cloud Studios in Burbank, CA. The songs recorded were &quot;The Rust&quot;, &quot;Kiss This&quot;, and &quot;World Gone Wild&quot;, the latter of which Lion had previously performed with a late 1980s line-up of World War III. Another song the band worked on was &quot;Blood Provider&quot;, based on Badlands&#x27; &quot;Sun Red Sun&quot;, which later surfaced on the posthumous &quot;Dusk&quot; album in 1998. In 1996, Lee released an instrumental solo album titled &quot;A Fine Pink Mist&quot; on the Pony Canyon label in Japan with the intention of also releasing the Wicked Alliance album through the same company. However, Lee and Lion never finished the album and no tracks from it have surfaced to date.

Throughout most of the 1990s and into the new millennium, Lee kept a relatively low profile. He has most notably appeared on musical tributes to Queen, AC/DC, Rush, Van Halen, Randy Rhoads, and Metallica. Lee also briefly joined Bourgeois Pigs with Shark Island vocalist Richard Black, guitarist Michael Guy, and bassist Tony Franklin. One demo from the Bourgeois Pigs sessions emerged on the Union 4 compilation in 2001 called &quot;Calamities of Vanity&quot;. In 2000, Lee played lead guitar on two tracks from Rob Rock&#x27;s &quot;Rage of Creation&quot; album. In 2005, Lee released his first album in eight years entitled Retraced, which consisted of blues covers from the 1960s and 1970s. Lee was briefly in a three-piece band called 3 Day Crush.

In 2011, Jake appeared in the video, along with Ron Keel, Blas Elias, Sunset Thomas and Paul Shortino, for the song &quot;We Come Undone&quot; by the band Beggars &amp; Thieves. The song is from their new CD &quot;We Are the Brokenhearted&quot; and Jake is featured performing the guitar solo. The following captions appear on the screen during Jake&#x27;s appearance: &quot;Jake E. Lee is alive and well, living in Las Vegas&quot; and &quot;He would just rather play with Beggars &amp; Thieves than deal with shady promoters and play Bark at the Moon 750 more times&quot;.

In 2012, Lee had a cameo in &quot;That Metal Show&quot;″s &quot;That Metal Special&quot; in Las Vegas, and was a guest on the fourth episode of the 12th season of the show as well as guest guitarist on the eighth and ninth episodes of the same season.

===Red Dragon Cartel===
In 2013, Lee formed a new band called Red Dragon Cartel. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2014. A second album, &quot;Patina&quot;, followed in 2018.

==Personal life==
In 2024, ex-Badlands bassist Greg Chaisson said that Lee was suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome in his right wrist and was awaiting to have surgery, which explains why Lee had not played live since 2019. However, in a later interview Lee stated that he was ultimately diagnosed with carpal tunnel by the surgeon, and that he was now receiving cortisone shots as he no longer had any cartilage remaining in his right hand.

On October 15, 2024, Lee was shot multiple times while walking his dog early in the morning in Las Vegas and survived in an incident that authorities believe to be &quot;completely random&quot;. In detailed social media updates made in late October through November, Lee explained that he confronted a group of masked men attempting to steal his neighbor&#x27;s motorcycle. After failing to deter them, they opened fire on Lee and fled the scene. Police were called by another neighbor who heard the shots. Lee was then rushed to Sunrise Hospital &amp; Medical Center and placed in their intensive care unit. Despite being shot multiple times, none of his wounds were life-threatening.

<text>Tree climbing is a recreational or functional activity consisting of ascending and moving around in the crowns of trees.

A rope, helmet, and harness can be used to increase the safety of the climber. Other equipment can also be used, depending on the experience and skill of the tree climber. Some tree climbers take special hammocks called &quot;Treeboats&quot; and Portaledges with them into canopies where they can have a picnic or sleep.

Some tree climbers employ a mixture of techniques and gear derived from rock climbing and caving. These techniques are also used to climb trees for other purposes: tree care (arborists), animal rescue, research , and activism.

==History==
Professional arborists have been climbing trees since the late 19th century in the UK and North America.
Climbing a tree every day for a year or longer has become a challenge taken up by several artists; 
Todd Smith from Louisville, KY, USA, climbed a tree every day for 3 years. Henrik G Dahle invited people to climb with him and interviewed people in the canopy of trees, including former competitive tree climber Leo Murray of Monkeydo, who now runs tree top adventures. Other artists include Christopher B Gray from Connecticut, USA, Kamila Wajda from Przybowka, Poland and Cecylia Malik from Kraków, Poland who has published a book about her year climbing trees.

==Techniques==
Many different techniques (free climbing, self-belayed climbing with a doubled-rope technique, single-rope technique, and lead climbing) are used to climb trees depending on the climber&#x27;s purpose for the climb and personal preference. Free climbing is performed without protective gear, and as such is the oldest method of climbing.

Technologically aided tree climbing is performed by lapping a long rope over a limb and ascending the fallen end using a friction knot tied from initial tie&#x27;s excess tail. There are a large number of factors that can affect the difficulty of a climb; the regularity of branching, the brittleness of dead wood, the texture of the bark, the width of the trunk and branches, the height and location of the tree, and the weather can all contribute to challenges faced while climbing.

Getting to the first branch of a tree is typically the most difficult part of the climb due to the potentially large distance between the first limb and the ground. Both aid climbing and free climbing can be used, but the throwline technique is most typical among hobbyists. This is done remotely from the ground utilizing a throw weight and line. The weight is swung from its attached line as a pendulum, with the line either held between two fingers of one hand at hip level, or in a basket configuration achieved by running a bight of the line back through the ring that is held in the other hand, with the weight being swung between the legs in a wide stance. It is then launched toward the targeted branch. Once over the branch, the weight must return to the ground, and may have to be manipulated so as to isolate a single anchor point (doubled rope technique), or for SRT into an optimal redirect. The throw bag is then removed; the climbing line is tied on, and pulled through the canopy and back down again, at which point the climbing system may be installed.

===Doubled-rope technique===
The doubled-rope technique (DRT or DdRT) is used to self belay the climber in such a way that the rope can be retrieved without going back up the tree. One end of the rope is fastened to the climber&#x27;s saddle (harness), from there the rope passes around the tree and back to a friction hitch, which is also attached to the climber. This system allows the climber to easily adjust the rope to provide a belay if free-climbing, or to go up or down if hanging on the rope. As long as the climber is below the anchor and there is minimal slack in the system, any fall will be restrained. This system can be placed into the tree from the ground, or the climber can advance the rope up the tree over the course of the climb.

===Single-rope technique===
The single-rope technique (SRT) is used mainly for getting to the top of large trees that cannot be easily free-climbed. With the adequate hardware, a throw line, an attached weight, and a launching system (e.g., a bow or slingshot), a climbing rope can be anchored to a branch very high in the tree. This is done by launching the weight (with the throw line attached) over the desired limb and tying the climbing rope to the unweighted end. The climbing rope is then hauled over the branch by pulling on the throw line. The line is anchored to the trunk or to the high limb itself by running one end through a closed bight made in the other end. The climber then ascends the rope (using a set of friction hitches or mechanical ascenders) to obtain the desired limb. With practice, this method is typically fastest and requires the least amount of hardware. One drawback is that it does not necessarily involve directly ascending the tree itself, as the vast majority of the time spent climbing is ascending the rope, and not the tree itself. Additionally, it can provide greater safety to a climber over DRT or lead climbing techniques, as the climber can rig the rope over multiple limbs when using a ground-level trunk anchor. If one limb breaks, then lower limbs may stop the fall.

===Lead climbing===
Lead climbing is employed by climber where points of protection are formed by girthing the tree&#x27;s limbs with slings. Once the lead climber ascends the tree, they may create a belay or top rope anchor or else simply rappel down. If an anchor is created, then other climbers can subsequently climb the tree on belay without having to lead. Drawbacks to this method include the probability of hitting a lower limb or the main trunk in the event of a fall.

<doc id="305438" wikidata="Q1118286" url="?curid=305438" title="Kanaka (Pacific Island worker)">
<text>Kanakas were workers (a mix of voluntary and involuntary) from various Pacific Islands employed in British colonies, such as British Columbia (Canada), Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, and Queensland (Australia) in the 19th and early 20th centuries. They also worked in California (United States) and Chile (see also Easter Island and the Rapa Nui).

&quot;Kanaka&quot; originally referred only to Native Hawaiians, from their own name for themselves, &quot;kānaka ʻōiwi&quot; or &quot;kānaka maoli&quot;, &quot;kānaka&quot; meaning &quot;man&quot; in the Hawaiian language. In the Americas in particular, native Hawaiians were the majority; but Kanakas in Australia were almost entirely Melanesian. In Australian English &quot;kanaka&quot; is now avoided outside of its historical context, as it has been used as an offensive term.

==Australia==

According to the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;kanaka&quot;, which was once widely used in Australia, is now regarded in Australian English as an offensive term for a Pacific Islander. Most &quot;Kanakas&quot; in Australia were people from Melanesia, rather than Polynesia. The descendants of 19th century immigrants to Australia from the Pacific Islands now generally refer to themselves as &quot;South Sea Islanders&quot;, and this is also the term used in formal and official situations.

Most of the original labourers were recruited or blackbirded (kidnapped or deceived) from the Solomon Islands, New Hebrides (Vanuatu) and New Caledonia, with others from the Loyalty Islands.

The first shipload of 65 Melanesian labourers arrived in Boyd Town on 16 April 1847 on board the &quot;Velocity&quot;, a vessel under the command of Captain Kirsopp and chartered by Benjamin Boyd. Boyd was a Scottish colonist who wanted cheap labourers to work at his expansive pastoral leaseholds in the colony of New South Wales. He financed two more procurements of South Sea Islanders, 70 of which arrived in Sydney in September 1847, and another 57 in October of that same year. Many of these Islanders soon absconded from their workplaces and were observed starving and destitute on the streets of Sydney. After the report of the alleged murder of the Native Chief of the Island of Rotumah in 1848, a closed-door enquiry was held, choosing not to take any action against Boyd or Kirsopp. The experiment of utilising Melanesian labour was discontinued in Australia until Robert Towns recommenced the practice in the early 1860s.

After 1863, more than 62,000 Islanders were brought to Australia; in 1901, about 10,000 were living in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901, legislation complementing the White Australia policy, ordained the deportation of all post-1879 arrivals to the Solomon Islands or the New Hebrides, where &quot;neither property, nor rights, nor welcome awaited them&quot;. Antonius Tua Tonga, a Kanaka who had lived in Queensland since the age of four, petitioned the King of England for a mitigation of the legislation, but the Australian prime minister, Alfred Deakin, advised the British government the petition was a front for planters, and the deportations took place largely as intended. A legislative amendment in 1905 exempted those of &quot;extreme age&quot;, those married to whites, and freeholders. The prime minister, Alfred Deakin, declined to exempt those schooled in Australia.

The descendants of those who avoided deportation today form Australia&#x27;s largest Melano-Polynesian ethnic group. Many Australian South Sea Islanders are also of mixed ancestry, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, for whom they are often mistaken. As a consequence, Australian South Sea Islanders have faced forms of discrimination similar to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders.

After 1994, the Australian South Sea Islander community was recognised as a unique minority group, following a report by the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which found they had become more disadvantaged than indigenous Australians.

==Canada==

Canadian Kanakas were all Hawaiian in origin. They had been aboard the first exploration and trading ships to reach the Pacific Northwest Coast. There were cases of Kanakas jumping ship then living amongst various First Nations peoples. The first Kanakas to settle came from Fort Vancouver after clearing the original Fort Langley site and building the palisade (1827). They were often assigned to the fur brigades and Express of the fur companies and were a part of the life of company forts. A great many were contracted to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company while some had arrived in the area as ship&#x27;s hands. In other instances, they migrated north from California. The Kanaka Rancherie was a settlement of Native Hawaiian migrant workers in Vancouver.

Many Kanaka men married First Nations women, and their descendants can still be found in British Columbia and neighbouring parts of Canada, and the United States (particularly in the states of Washington and Oregon). Kanaka Creek, British Columbia, was a community of mixed Hawaiian-First families established across the Fraser River from Fort Langley in the 1830s, which remains on the map today.

Kanakas were active in both the California Gold Rush, and in the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush and other rushes. Kanaka Bar, British Columbia gets its name from claims staked and worked by Kanakas who had previously worked for the fur company (which today is a First Nations community of the Nlakaʼpamux people).

There were no negative connotations in the use of Kanaka in British Columbian and Californian English of the time, and in its most usual sense today, it denotes someone of Hawaiian ethnic inheritance, without any pejorative meaning.

One linguist holds that &quot;Canuck&quot;, a nickname for Canadians, is derived from the Hawaiian &quot;Kanaka&quot;.

==United States==
The first native workers from the Hawaiian Islands (called the &quot;Sandwich Islands&quot; at the time) arrived on the &quot;Tonquin&quot; in 1811 to clear the site and help build Fort Astoria, as undertaken by the Pacific Fur Company. Nearly 12 Kanakas or a third of the workforce wintered over among &quot;Astorians&quot;. Kanakas built Fort Elizabeth on the island of Kauai in Hawaii for the Russian American Company in 1817, with others to follow.

By the 1820s, Kanakas were employed in the kitchen and other skilled trades by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at Fort Vancouver, mostly living south and west of the main palisade in an area known as &quot;Kanaka Village.&quot; Kanakas, employed in agriculture and ranching, were present in the mainland United States as early as 1834, primarily in California under Spanish colonial rule, and later under American company contracts. (Richard Henry Dana refers often to Kanaka workers and sailors on the Californian coast in his book &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;).

The migration of Kanakas peaked between 1900 and 1930, and most of their families soon blended by intermarriage into the Chinese, Filipino, and more numerous Mexican populations with whom they came in contact. At one point, Native Hawaiians harvested sugar beets and picked apples in the states of Washington and Oregon.

The Kanakas have left a legacy in Oregon place names, such as Kanaka Flat in Jacksonville, the Owyhee River in southeastern Oregon (Owyhee is an archaic spelling of Hawaii) and the Kanaka Gulch.

<text>Kensico Cemetery, located in Valhalla, Westchester County, New York was founded in 1889, when many New York City cemeteries were becoming full, and rural cemeteries were being created near the railroads that served the city. Initially , it was expanded to in 1905, but reduced to in 1912, when a portion was sold to the neighboring Gate of Heaven Cemetery.

Many entertainment figures of the early twentieth century, including Russian-born Sergei Rachmaninoff, were buried here. The cemetery has a special section for members of the Actors&#x27; Fund of America and the National Vaudeville Association, some of whom died in abject poverty.

The cemetery contains four Commonwealth war graves, of three Canadian Army soldiers of World War I and a repatriated American Royal Air Force airman of World War II.

As of December 2021, eight Major League Baseball players are buried here, including Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Lou Gehrig.

Sharon Gardens is a section of Kensico Cemetery, which was created in 1953 for Jewish burials.

<text>Christian Friedrich (or Frederick) Wilhelm von der Ahe (; October 7, 1851 – June 5, 1913) was a German-American entrepreneur, best known as the owner of the St. Louis Brown Stockings of the American Association, now known as the St. Louis Cardinals.

==Career==
Born in the fall of 1851 in Hille, Kingdom of Prussia, von der Ahe immigrated alone to New York City around 1870, but quickly moved to St. Louis, where he worked as a clerk in a grocery store. Later, he bought out the store owner and expanded business by establishing a saloon in the back of the store. Von der Ahe noticed that a number of his patrons visited the saloon after baseball games, so in 1882 he bought the bankrupt and scandal-ridden St. Louis Brown Stockings baseball franchise for $1,800 and joined the American Association baseball league. He named the team the Browns and hired future Chicago White Sox owner Charles Comiskey to play first base and eventually manage the team.

Von der Ahe took a very active role in the team, even though he knew almost nothing about baseball. Other than player/manager/owner Albert Spalding, Von der Ahe was the first baseball owner with a significant public persona, the predecessor of Bill Veeck, Charlie Finley and George Steinbrenner in this regard. With his thick German accent (&quot;I am der boss bresident of der Prowns!&quot;), bushy mustache and showmanship, he was as much of a story as his players.

The Browns dominated the American Association, winning four straight league championships starting in 1885. Von der Ahe&#x27;s baseball, beer, and other investments made him very rich. He made $500,000 off the baseball team alone. He set the ticket price at 25 cents, hoping fans would spend money on beer. As a result, the Browns led the league in attendance and soon had to expand the ballpark. The term &quot;fan&quot; (from fanatic) is sometimes attributed to von der Ahe.

In 1885, von der Ahe erected a larger-than-life statue outside of Sportsman&#x27;s Park, not of any of his star players, but of himself. A sportswriter from Denver mockingly dubbed the statue &quot;Von der Ahe discovers Illinois.&quot; Although eccentric, von der Ahe made a number of innovations, including operating a farm club called the St. Louis Whites. Also, tradition holds that von der Ahe was the first to sell hot dogs at the ballpark, although some historians dispute this. Von der Ahe billed himself as the &quot;Millionaire Sportsman&quot;.

In 1887, after a poor showing in the World Series, the ill-tempered von der Ahe threatened to withhold his players&#x27; share of the earnings. In 1891, he was also majority owner of the Cincinnati Kelly&#x27;s Killers, which played for part of one season in the American Association.

In 1892 the team joined the National League after the American Association folded. Unfortunately for the Browns, they, along with three other AA refugees, were forced to place their players in a pool and give the established NL clubs first choice to sign them. By this time, Comiskey had lost patience with von der Ahe, and signed with the Cincinnati Reds. Without Comiskey&#x27;s eye for talent, the Browns crumbled to only their second losing record as a fully professional team, finishing 11th. They would never come close to contention again during von der Ahe&#x27;s ownership, never finishing higher than ninth in their first seven years in the NL and even finishing last twice.

Legal problems plagued von der Ahe&#x27;s ownership, especially in the later years. In an effort to recoup his losses, in 1892 he moved to a larger ballpark, which he surrounded with an amusement park, complete with beer garden, a horse track in the outfield, a &quot;shoot-the-shoots&quot; water flume ride, and an artificial lake (used for ice skating in winter). The league, which prohibited gambling on its grounds, disapproved of the race track; so did von der Ahe&#x27;s outfielders. The press called the facility &quot;Coney Island West&quot; and nicknamed von der Ahe &quot;Von der Ha Ha.&quot;

With losses still piling up, von der Ahe resorted to selling off his best players, mostly to Brooklyn. In 1898, part of the ballpark burned down during an April game with Chicago; his second wife divorced him; and his bondsman kidnapped him for not paying his debts. In a highly publicized trial connected with the fire, von der Ahe lost his baseball team. The Browns changed hands twice and changed their name twice, first to the Perfectos (1899) and then to the Cardinals (1900). The American League team known as the St. Louis Browns from 1902 to 1953 had no connection to von der Ahe&#x27;s team aside from the name, which was designed to invoke the memory of the 1885–1889 era.

Von der Ahe soon lost his other wealth as well and was reduced to tending bar in a small saloon. Comiskey frequently sent von der Ahe money to help make ends meet. In April 1908, the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns played each other in a benefit game for him. The club raised $4,300.

==Death==
Due to a life of heavy alcohol consumption, he died of cirrhosis of the liver on June 5, 1913. He was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, with the statue that once stood in front of Sportsman&#x27;s Park adorning his grave.

==Tribute==
In 2015 Von der Ahe was named to the Pre-Integration Committee ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

<doc id="305456" wikidata="Q180168" url="?curid=305456" title="Conway chained arrow notation">
<text>Conway chained arrow notation, created by mathematician John Horton Conway, is a means of expressing certain extremely large numbers. It is simply a finite sequence of positive integers separated by rightward arrows, e.g. formula_1.

As with most combinatorial notations, the definition is recursive. In this case the notation eventually resolves to being the leftmost number raised to some (usually enormous) integer power.

==Definition and overview==
A &quot;Conway chain&quot; is defined as follows:
* Any positive integer is a chain of length formula_2.
* A chain of length &quot;n&quot;, followed by a right-arrow → and a positive integer, together form a chain of length formula_3.

Any chain represents an integer, according to the six rules below. Two chains are said to be equivalent if they represent the same integer.

Let formula_4 denote positive integers and let formula_5 denote the unchanged remainder of the chain. Then:
#An empty chain (or a chain of length 0) is equal to formula_2.
#The chain formula_7 represents the number formula_7.
#The chain formula_9 represents the number formula_10.
#The chain formula_11 represents the number formula_12 (see Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation)
#The chains formula_13 and formula_14 represent the same number as the chain formula_5
#Else, the chain formula_16 represents the same number as the chain formula_17.

==Properties==

Let formula_18 denote sub-chains of length 1 or greater.
#A chain evaluates to a perfect power of its first number
#Therefore, formula_19 is equal to formula_2
#formula_21 is equivalent to formula_22
#formula_23 is equal to formula_24
#formula_25 is equivalent to formula_26

==Interpretation==
One must be careful to treat an arrow chain &quot;as a whole&quot;. Arrow chains do not describe the iterated application of a binary operator. Whereas chains of other infixed symbols (e.g. 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) can often be considered in fragments (e.g. (3 + 4) + 5 + (6 + 7)) without a change of meaning (see associativity), or at least can be evaluated step by step in a prescribed order, e.g. 34567 from right to left, that is not so with Conway&#x27;s arrow chains.

For example:
* formula_27
* formula_28
* formula_29

The sixth definition rule is the core: A chain of 4 or more elements ending with 2 or higher becomes a chain of the same length with a (usually vastly) increased penultimate element. But its &quot;ultimate&quot; element is decremented, eventually permitting the fifth rule to shorten the chain. After, to paraphrase Knuth, &quot;much detail&quot;, the chain is reduced to three elements and the fourth rule terminates the recursion.

==Examples==
Examples get quite complicated quickly. Here are some small examples:

formula_30

:formula_31 (By rule 2)

formula_32

:formula_33 (By rule 3)
:Thus, formula_34

formula_35

:formula_36 (By rule 4)
:formula_37
:formula_38
:formula_39
:formula_40 formula_41
:formula_42

formula_43

:formula_44 (By rule 4)
:formula_45 (see Knuth&#x27;s up arrow notation)

formula_46

:formula_47 (By rule 4)
:formula_48
:formula_49
:formula_50
:formula_51
:formula_52
:formula_53
:formula_54 (see tetration)

formula_55

:formula_56 (By rule 6)
:formula_57 (By rule 3)
:formula_58 (By rule 5)
:formula_59 (By rule 6)
:formula_60 (By rule 6)
:formula_61 (By rule 4)

:= &quot;much larger than previous number&quot;

formula_62

:formula_63 (By rule 6)
:formula_64 (By rule 3)
:formula_65 (By rule 5)
:formula_66 (By rule 6)
:formula_67 (By rule 4)
:= &quot;much, much larger than previous number&quot;

===Systematic examples===
The simplest cases with four terms (containing no integers less than 2) are:
* formula_68&lt;br&gt;formula_69&lt;br&gt;formula_70&lt;br&gt;formula_71&lt;br&gt;formula_72
: (equivalent to the last-mentioned property)
* formula_73&lt;br&gt;formula_74&lt;br&gt;formula_75&lt;br&gt;formula_76&lt;br&gt;formula_77
* formula_78&lt;br&gt;formula_79&lt;br&gt;formula_80

We can see a pattern here. If, for any chain formula_22, we let formula_82 then formula_83 (see functional powers).

Applying this with formula_84, then formula_85 and formula_86

Thus, for example, formula_87.

Moving on:
* formula_88&lt;br&gt;formula_89&lt;br&gt;formula_90&lt;br&gt;formula_91&lt;br&gt;formula_92

Again we can generalize. When we write formula_93 we have formula_94, that is, formula_95. In the case above, formula_96 and formula_97, so formula_98

==Ackermann function==
The Ackermann function can be expressed using Conway chained arrow notation:

:formula_99 for formula_100 (Since formula_101 in hyperoperation)

hence

:formula_102 for formula_103
:(formula_104 and formula_105 would correspond with formula_106 and formula_107, which could logically be added).

==Graham&#x27;s number==
Graham&#x27;s number cannot be expressed in Conway chained arrow notation, but it is bounded by the following:

formula_108

Proof: We first define the intermediate function formula_109, which can be used to define Graham&#x27;s number as formula_110. (The superscript 64 denotes a functional power.)

By applying rule 2 and rule 4 backwards, we simplify:

formula_111
:formula_112 (with 64 formula_113&#x27;s)
:formula_114
:formula_115
formula_116

formula_117
:formula_118 (with 64 formula_113&#x27;s)
formula_120

formula_121
:formula_122 (with 64 formula_113&#x27;s)
:formula_124 (with 65 formula_113&#x27;s)
:formula_126 (computing as above).
:formula_127 
formula_128

Since &quot;f&quot; is strictly increasing,
:formula_129
which is the given inequality.

With chained arrows, it is very easy to specify a number much greater than Graham&#x27;s number, for example, formula_130.

formula_131
:formula_132
:formula_133
:formula_134
formula_135
which is much greater than Graham&#x27;s number, because the number formula_136 formula_137 is much greater than formula_138.

== CG function ==
Conway and Guy created a simple, single-argument function that diagonalizes over the entire notation, defined as:

formula_139

meaning the sequence is:

formula_140

formula_141

formula_142

formula_143

formula_144

This function, as one might expect, grows extraordinarily fast.

== Extension by Peter Hurford ==
Peter Hurford, a web developer and statistician, has defined an extension to this notation:

formula_145

formula_146

All normal rules are unchanged otherwise.

formula_147 is already equal to the aforementioned formula_148, and the function formula_149 is much faster growing than Conway and Guy&#x27;s formula_150.

Note that expressions like formula_151 are illegal if formula_152 and formula_153 are different numbers; a chain must have only one type of right-arrow.

However, if we modify this slightly such that:

formula_154

then not only does formula_151 become legal, but the notation as a whole becomes much stronger.

<text>Kandy ( &quot;Mahanuwara&quot;, ; Kandy, ) is a major city located in the Central Province of Sri Lanka. It was the last capital of the Sinhalese monarchy from 1469 to 1818, under the Kingdom of Kandy. The city is situated in the midst of hills in the Kandy plateau, which crosses an area of tropical plantations, mainly tea. Kandy is both an administrative and religious city and the capital of the Central Province. Kandy is the home of the Temple of the Tooth Relic (&quot;Sri Dalada Maligawa&quot;), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988. Historically the local Buddhist rulers resisted Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonial expansion and occupation.

== Etymology ==
The city and the region have been known by many different names and versions of those names. Some scholars suggest that the original name of Kandy was Katubulu Nuwara located near the present Watapuluwa. However, the more popular historical name is Senkadagala or Senkadagalapura, officially Senkadagala Siriwardhana Maha Nuwara (meaning &#x27;great city of Senkadagala of growing resplendence&#x27;), generally shortened to &#x27;Maha Nuwara&#x27;. According to folklore, this name originated from one of the several possible sources. One being the city was named after a brahmin with the name Senkanda who lived in a cave nearby, and another being a queen of Vikramabahu III was named Senkanda, and after a coloured stone named Senkadagala. The Kingdom of Kandy has also been known by various names. The English name Kandy, which originated during the colonial era, is derived from an anglicised version of the Sinhala Kanda Uda Rata (meaning the land on the mountain) or Kanda Uda Pas Rata (the five counties/countries on the mountain). The Portuguese shortened this to &quot;Candea&quot;, using the name for both the kingdom and its capital. In Sinhala, Kandy is called &quot;Maha Nuwara&quot;, meaning &quot;Great City&quot; or &quot;The Capital&quot;, although this is most often shortened to &quot;Nuwara&quot; in daily use.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
Historical records suggest that Kandy was first established by the Vikramabahu III (1357–1374 AD), who was the monarch of the Kingdom of Gampola, north of the present city, and named &quot;Senkadagalapura&quot; at the time.

Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu (1473–1511) was the first king of the Kingdom of Kandy. He was a royal from the Kotte Royal Bloodline and ruled Kandy as a semi-independent kingdom under the Kingdom of Kotte, making it the new capital of the Kandyan Kingdom. Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu was followed by his son Jayaweera Astana (1511–1551) and then by Karaliyadde Bandara (1551–1581) who was succeeded by his daughter Dona Catherina of Kandy (1581–1581). Dona Catherina was succeeded by Rajasinha I. Rajasinha I, however, preferred to rule the hill country from the Kingdom of Sitawaka on the west of the island. A period of turmoil for power ended with the ascent to the throne by Konappu Bandara who came to be known as Vimaladharmasuriya I. Having embraced Buddhism, he consolidated his authority further by bringing the tooth relic of the Buddha to Kandy from a place called Delgamuwa.

In 1592 Kandy became the capital city of the last remaining independent kingdom in the island after the coastal regions had been conquered by the Portuguese. Several invasions by the Portuguese were repelled, most notably in the campaign of Danture. After the Sinhalese–Portuguese War and the establishment of Dutch Ceylon, attempts by the Dutch to conquer the kingdom were repelled.

The kingdom tolerated a Dutch presence on the coast of Sri Lanka, although attacks were occasionally launched. The most ambitious offensive was undertaken in 1761, when King Kirti Sri Rajasinha attacked and overran most of the coast, leaving only the heavily fortified Negombo intact. When a Dutch retaliatory force returned to the island in 1763, Kirti Sri Rajasinha abandoned the coastline and withdrew into the interior. When the Dutch continued to the jungles the next year, they were constantly harassed by disease, heat, lack of provisions, and Kandyan sharpshooters, who hid in the jungle and inflicted heavy losses on the Dutch.

The Dutch launched a better-adapted force in January 1765, replacing their troops&#x27; bayonets with machetes and using more practical uniforms and tactics suited to jungle warfare. The Dutch were initially successful in capturing the capital, which was deserted, and the Kandyans withdrew to the jungles once more, refusing to engage in open battle. However, the Dutch were again worn down by constant attrition warfare. A peace treaty was signed in 1766. The Dutch remained in control of the coastal areas until 1796, when Great Britain took them over (while the Netherlands was under French control) due to the Kew letters during the Napoleonic wars. British possession of these areas was formalized with the treaty of Amiens in 1802. The next year the British also invaded Kandy in what became known as the First Kandyan War but were repulsed.

As the capital, Kandy had become home to the relic of the tooth of the Buddha which symbolizes a 4th-century tradition that used to be linked to the Sinhalese monarchy, since the protector of the relic was the ruler of the land. Thus the Royal Palace and the Temple of the Tooth were placed in close proximity to each other.

The last ruling dynasty of Kandy was the Nayaks. Kandy stayed independent until the early 19th century.
In the Second Kandyan War, the British launched an invasion that met no resistance and reached the city on 10 February 1815. The first time Sri Lanka fully fell into the hands of a foreign power was in Kandy with the signing of the Kandyan Convention in 1815 at the Sri Dalada Maligawa. The king, Vikrama Rajasinha of Kandy who was of South Indian ancestry faced powerful opposition from the Sinhalese chieftains and sought to reduce his power. A successful coup was organized by the Sinhalese chieftains in which they accepted the British crown as their new king. This ended over 2500 years of Sinhalese monarchs and the line of Kandyan monarchs and Rajasinha was taken as prisoner. By 2 March 1815 the island&#x27;s sovereignty was under that of the British Empire. A treaty known as the Kandyan Convention was signed between the British and the Radalas (Kandyan aristocrats). The treaty was not signed by the deposed King but by members of his court and other dignitaries of the Kandyan Kingdom. With this treaty, Kandy recognized George III as its King and became a British protectorate. The last king of the kingdom Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was captured and taken as a royal prisoner by the British to Vellore Fort in southern India along with all claimants to the throne. Some of the family members were also exiled to Tanjore (now known as Thanjavur, in Tamil Nadu). Their erstwhile living place is still referred to as &quot;Kandy Raja Aranmanai&quot; on the eastern part of Thanjavur town on Old Mariamman Koil Road.

=== Colonial era ===
During the British period in Sri Lanka, the history of Kandy and its townscape witnessed a rapid and drastic change and particularly after the Uva Rebellion. Sir Lowry is noted for recording in his Gazetteer &quot;The story of English rule in the Kandyan country during the rebellion of 1818 cannot be related without shame...Hardly a member of the leading families remained alive...Those whom the sword and the gun had spared, cholera and small pox and privations had slain by the hundreds...Others became ignorant and apathetic. Any subsequent development efforts of the government for many years were only attempts begun and abandoned&quot;.

In 1848 led by Gongalegoda Banda and Puran Appu saw the rebellion known as the Matale Rebellion. Prior to that the city and the country had been under British rule for 32 years, during which the British had expropriated the common land of the peasantry and reduced them to extreme poverty. The Kandyan villagers were forced to abandon their traditional way of life and become wage-workers in the abominable conditions that prevailed on these new estates and plantations that had been introduced. Despite all the pressure exerted by the colonials, the Kandyans refused. This forced the British to bring in hundreds of thousands of Tamil coolies from southern India.

The rebellion began on 26 July 1848 with Gongalegoda Banda, crowned as king, and Puran Appu, as prime minister, and their main objective was to capture Kandy back from the British. The Matale Rebellion was a peasant revolt in the hands of the Common people, the Kandyan leadership being totally wiped out after the Uva Rebellion, marked the first step in a transition from the classic feudal form of anti-colonial revolt to modern independence struggles. The leadership was for the first time passed from the Kandyan provinces into the hands of ordinary people or non-aristocrats.

In 1944, during World War II, the South East Asia Command of the allies was moved to Kandy, where it remained until the end of the war.

=== Contemporary Kandy ===
It is the second-largest city of the island and the capital of the Central Province of modern Sri Lanka. Its geographic location has made it a major transportation hub in the island: while Kandy being the gateway to the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka, the city can be reached by major motorways in every direction of the island. The railway line from Colombo, the seaport on the western coast runs via Kandy to the farthest point of Badulla in the Central Highlands. The main roads Colombo-Kandy and Kandy-Nuwara Eliya are two of the most scenic roads of Sri Lanka; Colombo-Kandy road passes through the rubber, tea plantations and rice paddies, Kandy-Nuwara Eliya road cuts through paddy fields and seamless tea plantations. Both roads claw their way up winding, rounding over the rings of hills. Currently, feasibility studies are afoot for another highway between Colombo and Kandy via Kadawata and the scenic city of Katugastota.

== Geography and climate ==

=== Topography ===
Kandy is located in the mountainous and thickly forested interior of the island. The city is located in between multiple mountain ranges including the Knuckles mountain range and the Hanthana Mountain Range, giving the city an elevation of above sea level. It lies adjacent to the artificial Kandy Lake and south of Udawatta Kele Sanctuary. Today Udawatte Kele is reducing its area.

=== Climate ===
In Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, its climate is tropical rainforest (Af). With Kandy located in the centre of the island and in a high elevation, the city has a relatively wetter and cooler temperatures than that of the tropical climate of the rest of the country, especially the coastal regions. Nuwara Eliya is south to it and has a cooler climate due to its higher elevation. Nevertheless, Kandy&#x27;s climate is still tropical as mean temperatures year round are above 18 °C on average. The city does experience a drier period from January to April. From May through to July and October to December the region experiences its monsoon season, during this time the weather is rough and unstable. From March through the middle of May is the intermonsoonal period, during this time there is light rain and strong humidity. The humidity is generally between 70% and 79%.
== Cityscape ==

The city of Kandy lies at an elevation of above sea level. Its plan developed around two open spaces: an elongated square, at the end of which are the administration buildings of the old capital, and an artificial lake that is quadrangular in form. A public garden adds to the openness of the city&#x27;s spatial organization.

Kandy has now grown out to encompass Peradeniya, home to the University of Peradeniya and the Botanical Gardens, Katugastota to the north, and east to Kundasale, Tennekumbura and Gurudeniya.

Reconstructed in the 18th century, the Sri Dalada Maligawa is built on a base of granite that was inspired by the temples of Sri Lanka&#x27;s former capital city, Anuradhapura. An array of materials (limestone, marble, sculpted wood, ivory, etc.) contribute to the richness of this temple. Throughout this small &quot;holy city&quot;, a number of recent Buddhist monasteries can be found.

=== Leisure and entertainment ===

Kandyans do many things for leisure and entertainment in the city. Kandy is popular due to the annual procession known as the Esala Perahera, in which one of the inner caskets used for covering the tooth relic of Buddha is taken in a grand procession through the streets of the city. This casket is taken on a royal tusker. The procession includes traditional dancers and drummers, flag bearers of the provinces of the old Kandyan kingdom, the Nilames (lay custodians of temples ) wearing their traditional dresses, torch-bearers, and also the grandly attired elephant. This ceremony which is annually held in the months of July or August attracts large crowds from all parts of the country and also many foreign tourists.

=== Sport ===
Kandy has produced national-level competitors in a wide range of sports, including cricket, rugby union, association football, swimming, field hockey, athletics, table tennis, boxing, basketball, golf, and even baseball, which has only been introduced into Kandy recently. Kandy has produced national captains of cricket and rugby and athletes that play at the highest level of all sports.

Unlike the rest of the country rugby is the most popular sport in the region. This is because of the local rugby union club, Kandy Sports Club being the reigning Club Rugby Champions in the national league for almost a decade, as well as the fondness and support the local schools treat the sport with. The Sri Lanka Sevens tournament is an annual international rugby union event held at the local Bogambara Stadium, attracting nations from all over the world.

Cricket is widely played in Kandy with the city having three first-class teams in the Premier Trophy, Saracens, Kandy Cricket Club and Kandy Youth Cricket Club, as well as being the main city for the Lanka Premier League side Kandy Falcons. Kandy is host to the Sri Lanka national cricket team with two Test status grounds, Asgiriya International Stadium and the newly built state-of-the-art Pallekele International Cricket Stadium. Both stadiums have held World Cup matches. Other cricket venues are Katugastota Oval (St.Anthony&#x27;s College ground), Lake View ground at Dharmaraja College, and Police ground Kandy.

Sports like field hockey, volleyball (the national sport of Sri Lanka), and association football however have not taken off in Kandy as much as other sports, due to the lack of proper playing fields, funding, and support. Cue games like billiards and snooker have hardly anyone playing. However, basketball, table tennis, badminton, and swimming are common due to the high participation of students and schools.

<doc id="305463" wikidata="Q2092313" url="?curid=305463" title="Steinhaus–Moser notation">
<text>In mathematics, Steinhaus–Moser notation is a notation for expressing certain large numbers. It is an extension (devised by Leo Moser) of Hugo Steinhaus&#x27;s polygon notation.

== Definitions ==
: a number in a triangle means .

: a number in a square is equivalent to &quot;the number inside triangles, which are all nested.&quot;

: a number in a pentagon is equivalent to &quot;the number inside squares, which are all nested.&quot;

etc.: written in an ()-sided polygon is equivalent to &quot;the number inside nested -sided polygons&quot;. In a series of nested polygons, they are associated inward. The number inside two triangles is equivalent to inside one triangle, which is equivalent to raised to the power of .

Steinhaus defined only the triangle, the square, and the circle , which is equivalent to the pentagon defined above.

== Special values ==
Steinhaus defined:
*mega is the number equivalent to 2 in a circle: 
*megiston is the number equivalent to 10 in a circle: ⑩

Moser&#x27;s number is the number represented by &quot;2 in a megagon&quot;. Megagon is here the name of a polygon with &quot;mega&quot; sides (not to be confused with the polygon with one million sides).

Alternative notations:
*use the functions square(x) and triangle(x)
*let be the number represented by the number in nested -sided polygons; then the rules are:
**formula_1
**formula_2
**formula_3
* and
**mega = formula_4
**megiston = formula_5
**moser = formula_6

==Mega==
A mega, ②, is already a very large number, since ② =
square(square(2)) = square(triangle(triangle(2))) =
square(triangle(22)) = 
square(triangle(4)) =
square(44) =
square(256) =
triangle(triangle(triangle(...triangle(256)...))) [256 triangles] =
triangle(triangle(triangle(...triangle(256256)...))) [255 triangles] ~
triangle(triangle(triangle(...triangle(3.2317 × 10616)...))) [255 triangles]

Using the other notation:

mega = formula_7

With the function formula_8 we have mega = formula_9 where the superscript denotes a functional power, not a numerical power.

We have (note the convention that powers are evaluated from right to left):
*formula_10 formula_11
*formula_12 formula_13≈formula_14
Similarly:
*formula_15 formula_16
*formula_17 formula_18
*formula_19 formula_20
etc.

Thus:
*mega = formula_21, where formula_22 denotes a functional power of the function formula_23.

Rounding more crudely (replacing the 257 at the end by 256), we get mega ≈ formula_24, using Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation.

After the first few steps the value of formula_25 is each time approximately equal to formula_26. In fact, it is even approximately equal to formula_27 (see also approximate arithmetic for very large numbers). Using base 10 powers we get:
*formula_28
*formula_29 (formula_30 is added to the 616)
*formula_31 (formula_32 is added to the formula_33, which is negligible; therefore just a 10 is added at the bottom)
*formula_34
*mega = formula_35, where formula_36 denotes a functional power of the function formula_37. Hence formula_38

==Moser&#x27;s number==

It has been proven that in Conway chained arrow notation,

:formula_39

and, in Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation,

:formula_40

Therefore, Moser&#x27;s number, although incomprehensibly large, is vanishingly small compared to Graham&#x27;s number:

:formula_41

<text>Mascot is an inner south suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Mascot is located 7 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is one of the administrative centres of the Bayside Council. A small part of Mascot is located in the Inner West Council. Mascot is on the northwest side of Botany Bay and contains Sydney Airport.

== History ==

The first land grants in the area were made in 1835, with market gardening being the main land use. Subdivision followed the construction of Botany Road in 1875 and a municipality known as North Botany was formed in 1888. A racecourse operated in this area in 1904 on land that was formerly owned by the Australian Golf Club. The race course was known as Ascot, named after its famous counterpart in England. Residents wanted the area to have an individual identity and a referendum was held in 1911 to choose between Ascot, and Booralee. An objection from the postal authorities to the use of &#x27;Ascot&#x27; led the council to alter the name to Mascot.

In 1920, Mascot was chosen as the site of a public airfield. Nigel Love was leasing from the Kensington Race club and in 1921 the Commonwealth Government purchased for this purpose. The first regular flights began in 1924. The suburb became the headquarters of Qantas as its hub in 1935. The Cooks River was diverted away from the area between 1947 and 1953 to provide more land for the airport.

In the early 1970s a large meeting of residents successfully requested that the NSW Builders Labourers Federation place a ban on the construction of town-house type dwellings if there was not sufficient green area retained around them.

== Heritage listings ==
Mascot has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: 1024 Botany Road: Botany Water Reserves and General Holmes Drive: Sewage Pumping Station 38

== Commercial area ==
Mascot has a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial areas. The main shopping centre is located on Botany Road. The area around Mascot railway station is being redeveloped to contain high-density commercial and residential developments. The Police Headquarters for the local Botany Bay Area Command is on Botany Road and Mascot Ambulance Station is situated directly opposite. Mascot Fire Station is located in Coward Street, beside the City of Botany Bay Council Chambers.

Sydney Airport, Australia&#x27;s principal airport, is an influential presence and key employer. The head office of Qantas is the Qantas Centre at 203 Coward Street in Mascot. There is also a number of airport hotels in the suburb.

== Transport ==
Mascot is serviced by a number of bus routes, which are operated by Transdev John Holland and Transit Systems. Routes 303, 306, 309, 310 and 350, routes travel down Botany Road. Routes 343 and 356 services travel down Gardeners Road and route 305 departs from the Qantas Centre.

The suburb is served by three railway stations on the Airport &amp; South Line. Mascot railway station is located in the residential and business area of the suburb. The International and Domestic railway stations are situated below the respective terminals of the airport. The Sydenham to Botany branch of the Metropolitan Goods railway line passes through the suburb and includes a yard in Mascot.

Recent improvements to Kingsford-Smith Airport have resulted in the creation of a bicycle path between Mascot (Coward Street) and the M5 East Freeway at Arncliffe. Other bike paths pass through Mascot to Botany Bay, the University of New South Wales and the Sydney CBD.

== Population ==

At the , the population of Mascot was 21,591, of which 35.1% were born in Australia. The most common foreign countries of birth were China 11.4%, Indonesia 9.8%, Mongolia 2.6%, India 2.6% and Ireland 2.2%. Some 37.9% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 12.5%, Indonesian 8.3%, Cantonese 4.2%, Spanish 3.8% and Greek 2.7%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 34.7% and Catholic 23.5%. Of occupied private dwellings in Mascot, 74.3% were flats or apartments; 21.0% were separate houses; and 3.9% were semi-detached, row- or terrace houses, townhouses etc.

<doc id="305465" wikidata="Q146701" url="?curid=305465" title="Lens (vertebrate anatomy)">
<text>The lens, or crystalline lens, is a transparent biconvex structure in most land vertebrate eyes. Relatively long, thin fiber cells make up the majority of the lens. These cells vary in architecture and are arranged in concentric layers. New layers of cells are recruited from a thin epithelium at the front of the lens, just below the basement membrane surrounding the lens. As a result the vertebrate lens grows throughout life. The surrounding lens membrane referred to as the lens capsule also grows in a systematic way, ensuring the lens maintains an optically suitable shape in concert with the underlying fiber cells. Thousands of suspensory ligaments are embedded into the capsule at its largest diameter which suspend the lens within the eye. Most of these lens structures are derived from the epithelium of the embryo before birth.

Along with the cornea, aqueous, and vitreous humours, the lens refracts light, focusing it onto the retina. In many land animals the shape of the lens can be altered, effectively changing the focal length of the eye, enabling them to focus on objects at various distances. This adjustment of the lens is known as &quot;accommodation&quot; (see also below). In many fully aquatic vertebrates, such as fish, other methods of accommodation are used, such as changing the lens&#x27;s position relative to the retina rather than changing the shape of the lens. Accommodation is analogous to the focusing of a photographic camera via changing its lenses. In land vertebrates the lens is flatter on its anterior side than on its posterior side, while in fish the lens is often close to spherical.

Accommodation in humans is well studied and allows artificial means of supplementing our focus, such as glasses, for correction of sight as we age. The refractive power of a younger human lens in its natural environment is approximately 18 dioptres, roughly one-third of the eye&#x27;s total power of about 60 dioptres. By 25 years of age the ability of the lens to alter the light path has reduced to 10 dioptres and accommodation continues to decline with age.

==Structure==
===Position in the eye===
The lens is located towards the front part of the vertebrate eye, called the anterior segment, which includes the cornea and iris positioned in front of the lens. The lens is held in place by the suspensory ligaments (Zonule of Zinn), attaching the lens at its equator to the rest of the eye through the ciliary body. Behind the lens is the jelly-like vitreous body which helps hold the lens in place. At the front of the lens is the liquid aqueous humor which bathes the lens with nutrients and other things. Land vertebrate lenses usually have an ellipsoid, biconvex shape. The front surface is less curved than the back. In a human adult, the lens is typically about 10mm in diameter and 4mm thick, though its shape changes with accommodation and its size grows throughout a person&#x27;s lifetime.

===Anatomy===
 The lens has three main parts: the lens capsule, the lens epithelium, and the lens fibers. The lens capsule is a relatively thick basement membrane forming the outermost layer of the lens. Inside the capsule, much thinner lens fibers form the bulk of the lens. The cells of the lens epithelium form a thin layer between the lens capsule and the outermost layer of lens fibers at the front of the lens but not the back. The lens itself lacks nerves, blood vessels, or connective tissue. Anatomists will often refer to positions of structures in the lens by describing it like a globe of the world. The front and back of the lens are referred to as the anterior and posterior &quot;poles&quot;, like the North and South poles. The &quot;equator&quot; is the outer edge of the lens often hidden by the iris and is the area of most cell differentiation. As the equator is not generally in the light path of the eye, the structures involved with metabolic activity avoid scattering light that would otherwise affect vision.

====Lens capsule====

 The lens capsule is a smooth, transparent basement membrane that completely surrounds the lens. The capsule is elastic and its main structural component is collagen. It is presumed to be synthesized by the lens epithelium and its main components in order of abundance are heparan sulfate proteoglycan (sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)), entactin, type IV collagen and laminin. The capsule is very elastic and so allows the lens to assume a more spherical shape when the tension of the suspensory ligaments is reduced. The human capsule varies from 2 to 28 micrometres in thickness, being thickest near the equator (peri-equatorial region) and generally thinner near the posterior pole.
The photos from electron and light microscopes show an area of the capsule lens equator where the capsule grows and adjacent to where thousands of suspensory ligaments attach. Attachment must be strong enough to stop the ligaments being detached from the lens capsule. Forces are generated from holding the lens in place and the forces added to during focusing. While the capsule is thinnest at the equator where its area is increasing, the anterior and posterior capsule is thinner than the area of ligament attachment.

====Lens epithelium====
The lens epithelium is a single layer of cells at the front of the lens between the lens capsule and the lens fibers. By providing the lens fibers with nutrients and removing waste, the cells of the epithelium maintain lens homeostasis. As ions, nutrients, and liquid enter the lens from the aqueous humor, Na+/K+-ATPase pumps in the lens epithelial cells pump ions out of the lens to maintain appropriate lens osmotic concentration and volume, with equatorially positioned lens epithelium cells contributing most to this current. The activity of the Na+/K+-ATPases keeps water and current flowing through the lens from the poles and exiting through the equatorial regions.

The cells of the lens epithelium also divide into new lens fibers at the lens equator. The lens lays down fibers from when it first forms in embryo until death.

====Lens fibers====
The lens fibers form the bulk of the lens. They are long, thin, transparent cells, firmly packed, with diameters typically 4–7 micrometres and lengths of up to 12mm long in humans. The lens fibers stretch lengthwise from the posterior to the anterior poles and, when cut horizontally, are arranged in concentric layers rather like the layers of an onion. If cut along the equator, cells have a hexagonal cross section, appearing as a honeycomb. The approximate middle of each fiber lies around the equator. These tightly packed layers of lens fibers are referred to as laminae. The lens fiber cytoplasms are linked together via gap junctions, intercellular bridges and interdigitations of the cells that resemble &quot;ball and socket&quot; forms.
The lens is split into regions depending on the age of the lens fibers of a particular layer. Moving outwards from the central, oldest layer, the lens is split into an embryonic nucleus, the fetal nucleus, the adult nucleus, the inner and outer cortex. New lens fibers, generated from the lens epithelium, are added to the outer cortex. Mature lens fibers have no organelles or nuclei.

====Cell fusion, voids and vacuoles====
 With the advent of other ways of looking at cellular structures of lenses while still in the living animal it became apparent that regions of fiber cells, at least at the lens anterior, contain large voids and vacuoles. These are speculated to be involved in lens transport systems linking the surface of the lens to deeper regions. Very similar looking structures also indicate cell fusion in the lens. The cell fusion is shown by micro-injection to form a stratified syncytium in whole lens cultures.

=== Development ===
 Development of the vertebrate lens begins when the human embryo is about 4mm long. The accompanying picture shows the process in a more easily studied chicken embryo. Unlike the rest of the eye which is derived mostly from the inner embryo layers, the lens is derived from the skin around the embryo. The first stage of lens formation takes place when a sphere of cells formed by budding of the inner embryo layers comes close to the embyro&#x27;s outer skin. The sphere of cells induces nearby outer skin to start changing into the lens placode. The lens placode is the first stage of transformation of a patch of skin into the lens. At this early stage, the lens placode is a single layer of cells.

As development progresses, the lens placode begins to deepen and bow inwards. As the placode continues to deepen, the opening to the surface ectoderm constricts and the lens cells bud off from the embryo&#x27;s skin to form a sphere of cells known as the &quot;lens vesicle&quot;. When the embryo is about 10mm long the lens vesicle has completely separated from the skin of the embryo.

The embryo then sends signals from the developing retina, inducing the cells closest to the posterior end of the lens vesicle to elongate toward the anterior end of the vesicle. These signals also induce the synthesis of proteins called crystallins. As the name suggests the crystallins can form a clear highly refractive jelly. These elongating cells eventually fill in the center of the vesicle with cells, that are long and thin like a strand of hair, called fibers. These primary fibers become the nucleus in the mature lens. The epithelial cells that do not form into fibers nearest the lens front give rise to the lens epithelium.

Additional fibers are derived from lens epithelial cells located at the lens equator. These cells lengthen towards the front and back wrapping around fibers already laid down. The new fibers need to be longer to cover earlier fibers but as the lens gets larger the ends of the newer fibers no longer reach as far towards the front and back of the lens. The lens fibers that do not reach the poles form tight, interdigitating seams with neighboring fibers. These seams being less crystalline than the bulk of the lens are more visible and are termed &quot;sutures&quot;. The suture patterns become more complex as more layers of lens fibers are added to the outer portion of the lens.

The lens continues to grow after birth, with the new secondary fibers being added as outer layers. New lens fibers are generated from the equatorial cells of the lens epithelium, in a region referred to as the &quot;germinative zone&quot; and &quot;bow region&quot;. The lens epithelial cells elongate, lose contact with the capsule and epithelium at the back and front of the lens, synthesize crystallin, and then finally lose their nuclei (enucleate) as they become mature lens fibers. In humans, as the lens grows by laying down more fibers through to early adulthood, the lens becomes more ellipsoid in shape. After about age 20 the lens grows rounder again and the iris is very important for this development.

Several proteins control the embryonic development of the lens though PAX6 is considered the master regulator gene of this organ. Other effectors of proper lens development include the Wnt signaling components BCL9 and Pygo2. The whole process of differentiation of the epithelial cells into crystallin filled fiber cells without organelles occurs within the confines of the lens capsule. Older cells cannot be shed and are instead internalized towards the center of the lens. This process results in a complete temporally layered record of the differentiation process from the start at the lens surface to the end at the lens center. The lens is therefore valuable to scientists studying the process of cell differentiation.

===Variations in lens structure===
In many aquatic vertebrates, the lens is considerably thicker, almost spherical resulting in increased light refraction. This difference helps compensate for the smaller angle of refraction between the eye&#x27;s cornea and the watery environment, as they have more similar refractive indices than cornea and air. The fiber cells of fish are generally considerably thinner than those of land vertebrates and it appears crystallin proteins are transported to the organelle free cells at the lens exterior to the inner cells through many layers of cells. Some vertebrates need to see well both above and below water at times. One example is diving birds which have the ability to change focus by 50 to 80 dioptres. Compared with animals adapted for only one environment diving birds have a somewhat altered lens and cornea structure with focus mechanisms to allow for both environments. Even among terrestrial animals the lens of primates such as humans is unusually flat going some way to explain why our vision, unlike diving birds, is particularly blurry under water.

==Function==

===Focusing===
In humans the widely quoted Helmholtz mechanism of focusing, also called accommodation, is often referred to as a &quot;model&quot;. Direct experimental proof of any lens model is necessarily difficult as the vertebrate lens is transparent and only functions well in the living animals. When considering all vertebrates aspects of all models may play varying roles in lens focus.

====The shape changing lens of many land based vertebrates====
==== External forces ====
The model of a shape changing lens of humans was proposed by Young in a lecture on the 27th Nov 1800. Others such as Helmholtz and Huxley refined the model in the mid-1800s explaining how the ciliary muscle contracts rounding the lens to focus near and this model was popularized by Helmholtz in 1909. The model may be summarized like this. Normally the lens is held under tension by its suspending ligaments being pulled tight by the pressure of the eyeball. At short focal distance the ciliary muscle contracts relieving some of the tension on the ligaments, allowing the lens to elastically round up a bit, increasing refractive power. Changing focus to an object at a greater distance requires a thinner less curved lens. This is achieved by relaxing some of the sphincter like ciliary muscles. While not referenced this presumably allows the pressure in the eyeball to again expand it outwards, pulling harder on the lens making it less curved and thinner, so increasing the focal distance. There is a problem with the Helmholtz model in that despite mathematical models being tried none has come close enough to working using only the Helmholtz mechanisms.
Schachar has proposed a model for land based vertebrates that was not well received. The theory allows mathematical modeling to more accurately reflect the way the lens focuses while also taking into account the complexities in the suspensory ligaments and the presence of radial as well as circular muscles in the ciliary body. In this model the ligaments may pull to varying degrees on the lens at the equator using the radial muscles while the ligaments offset from the equator to the front and back are relaxed to varying degrees by contracting the circular muscles. These multiple actions operating on the elastic lens allows it to change lens shape at the front more subtly. Not only changing focus, but also correcting for lens aberrations that might otherwise result from the changing shape while better fitting mathematical modeling.

The &quot;catenary&quot; model of lens focus proposed by Coleman demands less tension on the ligaments suspending the lens. Rather than the lens as a whole being stretched thinner for distance vision and allowed to relax for near focus, contraction of the circular ciliary muscles results in the lens having less hydrostatic pressure against its front. The lens front can then reform its shape between the suspensory ligaments in a similar way to a slack chain hanging between two poles might change its curve when the poles are moved closer together. This model requires fluid movement of the lens front only rather than trying to change the shape of the lens as a whole.

==== Internal forces ====
 When Thomas Young proposed the changing of the human lens&#x27;s shape as the mechanism for focal accommodation in 1801 he thought the lens may be a muscle capable of contraction. This type of model is termed intracapsular accommodation as it relies on activity within the lens. In a 1911 Nobel lecture Allvar Gullstrand spoke on &quot;How I found the intracapsular mechanism of accommodation&quot; and this aspect of lens focusing continues to be investigated. Young spent time searching for the nerves that could stimulate the lens to contract without success. Since that time it has become clear the lens is not a simple muscle stimulated by a nerve so the 1909 Helmholtz model took precedence. Pre-twentieth century investigators did not have the benefit of many later discoveries and techniques. Membrane proteins such as aquaporins which allow water to flow into and out of cells are the most abundant membrane protein in the lens. Connexins which allow electrical coupling of cells are also prevalent. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescent microscopy show fiber cells to be highly variable in structure and composition. Magnetic resonance imaging confirms a layering in the lens that may allow for different refractive plans within it. The refractive index of human lens varies from approximately 1.406 in the central layers down to 1.386 in less dense layers of the lens. This index gradient enhances the optical power of the lens. As more is learned about mammalian lens structure from &quot;in situ&quot; Scheimpflug photography, MRI and physiological investigations it is becoming apparent the lens itself is not responding entirely passively to the surrounding ciliary muscle but may be able to change its overall refractive index through mechanisms involving water dynamics in the lens still to be clarified. The accompanying micrograph shows wrinkled fibers from a relaxed sheep lens after it is removed from the animal indicating shortening of the lens fibers during near focus accommodation. The age related changes in the human lens may also be related to changes in the water dynamics in the lens.

====Lenses of birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and others====
 In reptiles and birds, the ciliary body which supports the lens via suspensory ligaments also touches the lens with a number of pads on its inner surface. These pads compress and release the lens to modify its shape while focusing on objects at different distances; the suspensory ligaments usually perform this function in mammals. With vision in fish and amphibians, the lens is fixed in shape, and focusing is instead achieved by moving the lens forwards or backwards within the eye using a muscle called the retractor lentus.

In cartilaginous fish, the suspensory ligaments are replaced by a membrane, including a small muscle at the underside of the lens. This muscle pulls the lens forward from its relaxed position when focusing on nearby objects. In teleosts, by contrast, a muscle projects from a vascular structure in the floor of the eye, called the &quot;falciform process&quot;, and serves to pull the lens backwards from the relaxed position to focus on distant objects. While amphibians move the lens forward, as do cartilaginous fish, the muscles involved are not similar in either type of animal. In frogs, there are two muscles, one above and one below the lens, while other amphibians have only the lower muscle.

In the simplest vertebrates, the lampreys and hagfish, the lens is not attached to the outer surface of the eyeball at all. There is no aqueous humor in these fish, and the vitreous body simply presses the lens against the surface of the cornea. To focus its eyes, a lamprey flattens the cornea using muscles outside of the eye and pushes the lens backwards.

While not vertebrate, brief mention is made here of the convergent evolution of vertebrate and Molluscan eyes. The most complex Molluscan eye is the Cephalopod eye which is superficially similar structure and function to a vertebrate eye, including accommodation, while differing in basic ways such as having a two part lens and no cornea. The fundamental requirements of optics must be filled by all eyes with lenses using the tissues at their disposal so superficially eyes all tend to look similar. It is the way optical requirements are met using different cell types and structural mechanisms that varies among animals.

=== Crystallins and transparency ===
 Crystallins are water-soluble proteins that compose over 90% of the protein within the lens. The three main crystallin types found in the human eye are α-, β-, and γ-crystallins. Crystallins tend to form soluble, high-molecular weight aggregates that pack tightly in lens fibers, thus increasing the index of refraction of the lens while maintaining its transparency. β and γ crystallins are found primarily in the lens, while subunits of α -crystallin have been isolated from other parts of the eye and the body. α-crystallin proteins belong to a larger superfamily of molecular chaperone proteins, and so it is believed that the crystallin proteins were evolutionarily recruited from chaperone proteins for optical purposes. The chaperone functions of α-crystallin may also help maintain the lens proteins, which must last a human for their entire lifetime.

Another important factor in maintaining the transparency of the lens is the absence of light-scattering organelles such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria within the mature lens fibers. Lens fibers also have a very extensive cytoskeleton that maintains the precise shape and packing of the lens fibers; disruptions/mutations in certain cytoskeletal elements can lead to the loss of transparency.

The lens blocks most ultraviolet light in the wavelength range of 300–400 nm; shorter wavelengths are blocked by the cornea. The pigment responsible for blocking the light is 3-hydroxykynurenine glucoside, a product of tryptophan catabolism in the lens epithelium. High intensity ultraviolet light can harm the retina, and artificial intraocular lenses are therefore manufactured to also block ultraviolet light. People lacking a lens (a condition known as aphakia) perceive ultraviolet light as whitish blue or whitish-violet.

=== Nourishment ===
The lens is metabolically active and requires nourishment in order to maintain its growth and transparency. Compared to other tissues in the eye, however, the lens has considerably lower energy demands.

By nine weeks into human development, the lens is surrounded and nourished by a net of vessels, the tunica vasculosa lentis, which is derived from the hyaloid artery. Beginning in the fourth month of development, the hyaloid artery and its related vasculature begin to atrophy and completely disappear by birth. In the postnatal eye, Cloquet&#x27;s canal marks the former location of the hyaloid artery.

After regression of the hyaloid artery, the lens receives all its nourishment from the aqueous humor. Nutrients diffuse in and waste diffuses out through a constant flow of fluid from the anterior/posterior poles of the lens and out of the equatorial regions, a dynamic that is maintained by the Na+/K+-ATPase pumps located in the equatorially positioned cells of the lens epithelium. The interaction of these pumps with water channels into cells called aquaporins, molecules less than 100 daltons in size among cells via gap junctions, and calcium using transporters/regulators (TRPV channels) results in a flow of nutrients throughout the lens.

Glucose is the primary energy source for the lens. As mature lens fibers do not have mitochondria, approximately 80% of the glucose is metabolized via anaerobic metabolism. The remaining fraction of glucose is shunted primarily down the pentose phosphate pathway. The lack of aerobic respiration means that the lens consumes very little oxygen.

==Clinical significance==
* Cataracts are opacities of the lens. While some are small and do not require any treatment, others may be large enough to block light and obstruct vision. Cataracts usually develop as the aging lens becomes more and more opaque, but cataracts can also form congenitally or after injury to the lens. Nuclear sclerosis is a type of age-related cataract. Diabetes is another risk factor for cataract. Cataract surgery involves the removal of the lens and insertion of an artificial intraocular lens.
* Presbyopia is the age-related loss of accommodation, which is marked by the inability of the eye to focus on nearby objects. The exact mechanism is still unknown, but age-related changes in the hardness, shape, and size of the lens have all been linked to the condition.
* Ectopia lentis is the displacement of the lens from its normal position.
* Aphakia is the absence of the lens from the eye. Aphakia can be the result of surgery or injury, or it can be congenital.

<text>Rose O&#x27;Neal Greenhow (1813– October 1, 1864) was a famous Confederate spy during the American Civil War. A socialite in Washington, D.C., during the period before the war, she moved in important political circles and cultivated friendships with presidents, generals, senators, and high-ranking military officers including John C. Calhoun and James Buchanan. She used her connections to pass along key military information to the Confederacy at the start of the war. In early 1861, she was given control of a pro-Southern spy network in Washington, D.C., by her handler, Thomas Jordan, then a captain in the Confederate Army. She was credited by Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, with ensuring the South&#x27;s victory at the First Battle of Bull Run in late July 1861.

The government found that information was being leaked and the trail led to Rose Greenhow&#x27;s residence. As punishment, Greenhow was subject to house arrest; found to have continued her activities, in 1862 after an espionage hearing, she, with her daughter &quot;Little Rose&quot;, was jailed for nearly five months in Washington, D.C., and deported to the Confederacy. She traveled to Richmond, Virginia, and began new tasks. Running the blockade, she sailed to Europe to represent the Confederacy on a diplomatic mission to France and Britain from 1863 to 1864. In 1863, she also wrote and published her memoir in London, which was popular in Britain. In 1864 off the coast of Wilmington, North Carolina, when Greenhow and other sailors saw a Yankee Craft pursuing their ship, Greenhow demanded a lifeboat for her and two other Confederates. She had gotten gold from the book she had written, and her money was sewn into her dress. When the other boat was driven to the ground, her lifeboat flipped, because she was weighed down by $2,000 worth of gold sewn into her underclothes and hung around her neck and she drowned. She was honored with a Confederate military funeral.

In 1993, the women&#x27;s auxiliary of the Sons of Confederate Veterans changed its name to the Order of the Confederate Rose in Greenhow&#x27;s honor, following publicity about her exploits in a TV movie the previous year.

==Early life==
She was born in 1813 as Maria Rosetta O&#x27;Neale on a small plantation in Montgomery County, Maryland, northwest of Washington, D.C. (Note: The biographical note on Greenhow at the National Archives and Records Administration, which holds a collection of her papers, says that O&#x27;Neal was born in 1817 in Port Tobacco, Maryland, but it is unclear what the documentation is for this.) She was the third of five daughters of John O&#x27;Neale, a planter and slaveholder, and his wife Eliza Henrietta Hamilton, who were Catholic. Called Rose as a child, O&#x27;Neal was the third born and close to her next older sister, Ellen (Mary Eleanor) and the final &quot;e&quot; was dropped off the family name in Rose&#x27;s early childhood. Their father died in 1817, murdered by his black valet. His widow, Eliza O&#x27;Neal, had four daughters to support and a cash-poor farm.

After being orphaned as children, Greenhow and her sister Ellen were invited to live with their aunt in Washington, D.C., around the year 1830. Their aunt, Mrs. Maria Ann Hill, ran a stylish boarding house at the Old Capitol Building (later the Old Capitol Prison) and the girls met many important figures in the Washington area. Her olive skin &quot;delicately flushed with color&quot; earned her the nickname &quot;Wild Rose.&quot;

In the 1830s, she met Robert Greenhow Jr., a prominent doctor, lawyer, and linguist from Virginia. Their courtship was well received by Washington society, including famed society matron Dolley Madison. In 1833, Greenhow&#x27;s sister Ellen O&#x27;Neal married Dolley&#x27;s nephew James Madison Cutts. In 1856, their daughter Adele Cutts married the widower Stephen A. Douglas, the senator from Illinois.

==Marriage and family==
In 1835, Rose married Dr. Robert Greenhow Jr. with Dolley&#x27;s blessing, and by the 1850s had long been an established socialite in the capital. Robert Greenhow worked at the U.S. Department of State. Robert&#x27;s step-sister, Mary Greenhow Lee, would visit him and Greenhow and the two women became close friends.

The Greenhows had four daughters: Florence, Gertrude, Leila, and Rose. Their youngest child was named Rose O&#x27;Neal Greenhow (her middle name being her mother&#x27;s maiden), and was nicknamed &quot;Little Rose&quot;. In 1871, Little Rose married Army officer William P. Duvall. They were the parents of two children, son William (died 1874) and daughter Lee, who later took the name Mary and was the wife of Louis Eugene Marié. The Duvalls divorced in 1899.

Robert&#x27;s work with the State Department prompted the family to move with him to Mexico City in 1850 and then to San Francisco, California. In 1852, Greenhow returned East with her children, a journey of months, giving birth to her last daughter in 1853. Her husband died in an accident in San Francisco in 1854. Being a widow did not disrupt Greenhow&#x27;s popularity in the capital. A short time later, their oldest child Florence married Seymour Treadwell Moore, a West Point graduate, career army officer, and Mexican War veteran. The couple moved west to Ohio.

==Confederate spy==
After losing her husband, Greenhow became more sympathetic to the Confederate cause. Greenhow was an advocate for secession and &quot;preserving the Southern way of life,&quot; including slavery. She was strongly influenced by her friendship with U.S. Senator John C. Calhoun from South Carolina. Greenhow&#x27;s loyalty to the Confederacy was noted by those with similar sympathies in Washington, and she was recruited as a spy. Her recruiter was U.S. Army captain Thomas Jordan, who had set up a pro-Southern spy network in Washington. He supplied her with a 26-symbol cipher for encoding messages.

After passing control of the espionage network to Greenhow, Jordan left the US Army, went South, and was commissioned as a captain in the Confederate Army. He continued to receive and evaluate her reports. Jordan appeared to be Greenhow&#x27;s handler for the Confederate Secret Service during its formative phase.

On July 9 and July 16 of 1861, Greenhow passed secret messages to Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard containing critical information regarding Union military movements for what would be the First Battle of Bull Run, including the plans of General Irvin McDowell. Assisting in her conspiracy were pro-Confederate members of Congress, Union officers, courier Betty Duvall, and her dentist, Aaron Van Camp, as well as his son who was also a Confederate soldier, Eugene B. Van Camp. Confederate President Jefferson Davis credited Greenhow&#x27;s information with the Confederates securing victory at Manassas over the Union Army on July 21.

After the battle she received the following telegram from Jordan: &quot;Our President and our General direct me to thank you. We rely upon you for further information. The Confederacy owes you a debt&quot;. (Signed) JORDAN, Adjutant-General.&quot; She became known as &quot;Rebel Rose&quot; for her work for the South.

===Capture and prison===
Knowing she was suspected of spying for the Confederacy, Greenhow feared for her remaining daughters&#x27; safety. Leila was sent to Ohio to join her older sister Florence Greenhow Moore, whose husband Seymour Treadwell Moore had become a captain in the Union Army. (He was breveted a brigadier general in May 1865 for his services and achieved a rank of lieutenant colonel after the war in his army career.) Only Little Rose stayed with Greenhow in Washington.

Allan Pinkerton was made head of the recently formed Secret Service and one of his first orders was to watch Greenhow, because of her wide circle of contacts on both sides of the sectional split. Due to the activities of visitors, he arrested Greenhow and placed her under house arrest at her 16th Street residence on August 23, 1861, along with one of her couriers, Lily Mackall. His agents traced other leaked information to Greenhow&#x27;s home. While searching her house, Pinkerton and his men found extensive intelligence materials left from evidence she tried to burn, including scraps of coded messages, copies of what amounted to eight reports to Jordan over a month&#x27;s time, and maps of Washington fortifications and notes on military movements.

The materials included numerous love letters supposedly from the abolitionist Republican U.S. Senator Henry Wilson from Massachusetts. She considered him her prize source, and claimed he gave her data on the &quot;number of heavy guns and other artillery in the Washington defenses,&quot; but he likely knew far more from his work on the Military Affairs Committee. The seized Greenhow papers are now held by the National Archives and Records Administration, with some available online. Contemporary biographers of Wilson have regarded the letters as likely not sent by Wilson as his handwriting and signature do not match those in the letters.

Pinkerton supervised visitors to Greenhow&#x27;s house and moved other suspected Southern sympathizers into it, giving rise to the nickname Fort Greenhow. He was pleased to oversee the visitors and messages, as it gave him more control of the Southern flow of information. While messages continued to be sent to Jordan, he discounted them after Pinkerton mounted his control. When a letter from Greenhow to Seward complained of her treatment was publicized, there was Northern criticism for what was perceived as too lenient treatment of a spy. Pinkerton transferred Greenhow on January 18, 1862, to Old Capitol Prison, shutting down Fort Greenhow. So many political prisoners were detained that a two-man commission was set up to review their cases at what were called espionage hearings. Greenhow was never subjected to trial. Her youngest daughter, &quot;Little Rose&quot;, then eight years old, was permitted to stay with her.

Greenhow continued to pass along messages while imprisoned. Passers-by could see Rose&#x27;s window from the street. Historians believe that the position of the blinds and number of candles burning in the window had special meaning to the &quot;little birdies&quot; passing by. Another account lists her prison room facing the prison yard &quot;so that she could not see or be seen&quot; and &quot;every effort was made to keep Mrs. Greenhow away from the windows.&quot; Greenhow also on one occasion flew the Confederate Flag from her prison window.

==International acclaim==
On May 31, 1862, Greenhow was released without trial (with her daughter), on condition she stay within Confederate boundaries. After they were escorted to Fortress Monroe at Hampton Roads, she and her daughter went on to Richmond, Virginia, where Greenhow was hailed by Southerners as a heroine. President Jefferson Davis welcomed her return and enlisted her as a courier to Europe. Greenhow ran the blockade and, from 1863 to 1864, traveled through France and Britain on a diplomatic mission building support for the Confederacy with the aristocrats.

Many European aristocrats had sympathy for the South&#x27;s elite; there were also strong commercial ties between Britain and the South. While in France, Greenhow was received in the court of Napoleon III at the Tuileries. In Britain, she had an audience with Queen Victoria. Greenhow met, and in 1864 became engaged to, Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville. The details of her mission to Europe are recorded in her personal diaries, dated August 5, 1863, to August 10, 1864, when she wrote, &quot;A sad sick feeling crept over me, of parting perhaps forever, from many dear to me...A few months before I had landed a stranger--I will not say in a foreign land--for it was the land of my ancestors--and many memories twined around my heart when my feet touched the shores of Merry England--but I was literally a stranger in the land of my fathers and a feeling of cold isolation was upon me.&quot;

Two months after arriving in London, Greenhow wrote her memoir, titled &quot;My Imprisonment and the First Year of Abolition Rule at Washington.&quot; She published it that year in London and it sold well throughout Britain.

==Death==
On August 19, 1864, Greenhow left Europe to return to the Confederacy, carrying dispatches. She traveled on the &quot;Condor,&quot; a British blockade runner. On October 1, 1864, the &quot;Condor&quot; ran aground at the mouth of the Cape Fear River near Wilmington, North Carolina, while being pursued by the Union gunboat USS &quot;Niphon&quot;. Fearing capture and reimprisonment, Greenhow fled the grounded ship by rowboat. A wave capsized the rowboat, and Greenhow drowned. She was weighed down by $2,000 worth of gold sewn into her underclothes and hung around her neck, returns from her memoir royalties.

When Greenhow&#x27;s body was recovered from the water near Wilmington, searchers found a small notebook and a copy of her book &quot;Imprisonment&quot; hidden on her. Inside the book was a note meant for her daughter, Little Rose. She was honored with a military funeral at St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church in Wilmington, North Carolina, and the Ladies Memorial Association, in 1888, marked her grave in Oakdale Cemetery with a cross that read &quot;Mrs. Rose O&#x27;Neal Greenhow. A Bearer of Dispatches to the Confederate Government.&quot;

== Legacy ==
*Since the mid-20th century, two biographies have been published about Greenhow.

*Greenhow&#x27;s exploits were dramatized in the 1990 television film &quot;The Rose and the Jackal,&quot; in which she was played by Madolyn Smith.
*Greenhow was a featured character played by Sue-Ann Leeds in the 1993 television drama &quot;Class of &#x27;61&quot;.
* In 1993, the women&#x27;s auxiliary of the Sons of Confederate Veterans changed its name to the Order of the Confederate Rose in her honor.
* In &quot;The Pinkertons&quot; episode &quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot;, Greenhow&#x27;s daughter (named Leila in the episode) is about to publish a scandalous biography of her late mother. The book&#x27;s publisher is murdered in an attempt to steal the manuscript.

<doc id="305472" wikidata="Q1422924" url="?curid=305472" title="Holden Commodore">
<text>The Holden Commodore is a series of automobiles that were sold by now-defunct Australian manufacturer Holden from 1978 until 2020. They were manufactured from 1978 to 2017 in Australia and from 1979 to 1990 in New Zealand, with production of the locally manufactured versions in Australia ending on 20 October 2017.

The first three generations of Holden produced Commodores (1978–2006) were based on the Opel designed V-body rear-wheel drive automotive platform, which was the basis of GM&#x27;s largest European models, but were structurally strengthened, mechanically modified, and, in time, enlarged by Holden for Australian road conditions, production needs, and market demands. The styling of these cars was generally similar to that of the Opel Commodore C, and later, the Opel Omega A/B and their Vauxhall sister models the Vauxhall Carlton and Omega.

The fourth generation Holden Commodore models VE and VF, manufactured by Holden from 2006 until 2017, were entirely designed in-house and based on the Holden-developed, rear-wheel drive Zeta platform.

Between 2018 and 2020, a rebadged, front-wheel drive Opel Insignia, built by Opel in Germany, was sold in Australia as the Holden Commodore (ZB). All sales of the last Commodore ended at the end of 2020, coinciding with the complete discontinuation of Holden as a subsidiary company, marque, and nameplate.

==History==
The Commodore replaced the long-serving Holden Kingswood and Holden Premier. Initially introduced as a single sedan body style, the range expanded in 1979 to include a station wagon. From 1984, Holden began branding the flagship model as Holden Calais, with the Commodore Berlina introduced in 1984 gaining independent Holden Berlina nomenclature in 1988. Long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice derivatives and Commodore utility body variants followed in 1990. The third generation architecture spawned the most body styles, with a new Holden utility launched in 2000 (known officially as the Holden Ute), reborn Monaro coupé in 2001, four-door Holden Crewman utility and all-wheel drive (AWD) Holden Adventra crossover in 2003. Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) in 1987 began official modification of high performance variants of the Commodore and its derivatives, under its own nameplate.

Rivalry came predominantly from the Ford Falcon—also locally built. Prior to the second generation Commodore of 1988, the Holden was positioned a full class below the full-size Falcon. To varying degrees, competition also came from mid-size offerings from Toyota Australia as well as Chrysler Australia, which morphed into Mitsubishi Motors Australia. Moreover, between 1989 and 1997, Australian federal government policy saw the launch of the Toyota Lexcen, which was a rebadged version of the second generation Commodore. With the introduction of the third generation in 1997, Holden implemented its largest export programs involving Commodore and its derivatives. In the Middle East and South Africa the Commodore sold as a Chevrolet. High-performance export versions followed in North America, sold as Pontiac and later Chevrolet. HSV also exported to the United Kingdom as Vauxhall, in the Middle East as Chevrolet Special Vehicles (CSV) and in New Zealand and Singapore as HSV.

In December 2013, Holden announced that it would cease its local production by the end of October 2017 committing, however, to use the long-standing Commodore nameplate on its fifth-generation fully imported replacement, moving to a front-wheel drive (FWD)/all-wheel drive (AWD) platform.

On 10 December 2019, Holden announced that the Commodore nameplate would be discontinued in 2020, in what is, according to Holden&#x27;s interim chairman and managing director Kristian Aquilina, &quot;decisive action to ensure a sharp focus on the largest and most buoyant market segments&quot;, focusing on their SUV and Ute range, which had accounted for over 76% of their lineup during 2019. This marks the end of the Commodore nameplate&#x27;s 41 years. On 17 February 2020, General Motors announced that the Holden marque in its entirety would be retired from sale in Australia and New Zealand by 2021.

== First generation (1978–1988)==
=== VB (1978–1980) ===


Introduced in October 1978, the VB Commodore development covered a period with the effects of the 1973 oil crisis still being felt. Hence, when Holden decided to replace the successful full-size HZ Kingswood with a new model line, they wanted the new car to be smaller and more fuel efficient. Originally, Holden looked at developing a new WA Kingswood, but that project was abandoned. With no replacement in development, Holden looked to Opel to provide the design foundations of the VB, basing it on the four-cylinder Rekord E body shell, with the front grafted on from the Opel Senator A, both constructed using GM&#x27;s V-body platform. This change was necessitated to accommodate the larger Holden six- and eight-cylinder engines. Holden also adopted the name &quot;Commodore&quot; from Opel, which had been using the name since 1967. Opel went on to use Holden&#x27;s Rekord-Senator hybrid as a foundation for its new generation Commodore C, slotting in between the two donor models.

During the VB&#x27;s development, Holden realised that when driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Opel Rekord would effectively break apart at the firewall. This forced Holden to re-engineer the entire car for the often harsh Australian road conditions, resulting in only 35 percent commonality with the Rekord. Among other changes, the Rekord&#x27;s MacPherson strut front suspension was modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These and other mechanical and structural modifications massively blew out development costs to a reported —a figure then close to the cost of developing an all-new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances for the development of a station wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end to the rear of the Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. Despite these issues, the VB Commodore was widely praised for its value for money sophistication, especially in regards to its steering, handling, braking, and ride quality. thus securing the &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year award for 1978.

The VB series retained 96 percent of the preceding HZ Kingswood&#x27;s interior space but was only 86 percent the HZ&#x27;s external size, although five percent larger than the Torana. With the Commodore dropping a full class below the Kingswood and its Ford Falcon competitor, the smaller Commodore was predictably more fuel-efficient. This downsizing was first seen as a major disadvantage for Holden, as they had effectively relinquished the potential of selling Commodores to the fleet and taxi industries. These sales losses were thought to be unrecoverable; however, the 1979 energy crisis saw Australian oil prices rise by 140 percent, putting substantial strain on the automotive industry to collectively downsize, a change that Holden had already done.

=== VC (1980–1981) ===

The most significant change to the VC Commodore of March 1980 was the engine upgrading to &quot;XT5&quot; specification. Now painted blue and thus known as the &quot;Blue&quot; straight-sixes and Holden V8s, these replaced the &quot;Red&quot; units fitted to the VB and earlier cars. Changes included a new twelve-port cylinder head, redesigned combustion chambers, inlet and exhaust manifolds, a new two-barrel carburettor . Tweaks and changes to the V8s surrounded the implementation of electronic ignition, revised cylinder head and inlet manifold design and the fitment of a four-barrel carburettor on the 4.2-litre variant. These changes brought improved efficiency, increased outputs and aided driveability. In response to increasing oil prices, a four-cylinder variant was spawned in June 1980. Displacing 1.9-litres, this powerplant known as &quot;Starfire&quot; was effectively Holden&#x27;s existing straight-six with two cylinders removed. The four&#x27;s peak power output of and torque rated at meant its performance was compromised. Reports indicate that the need to push the engine hard to extract performance led to real-world fuel consumption similar to the straight-sixes.

Holden&#x27;s emphasis on fuel economy extended beyond powertrains, with a fuel consumption vacuum gauge replacing the tachometer throughout the range, although this could be optioned back with the sports instrumentation package. Visual changes were limited: the relocation of the corporate crest to the centre of the redesigned grille, black-coloured trim applied to the tail lamp surrounds on sedans, and the embossment of model badging into the side rubbing strips. The previously undesignated base car, was now the Commodore L, opening up the range for a new unbadged sub-level car. This delete option model, was de-specified and available only to fleet customers. On the premium Commodore SL/E, a resurrected &quot;Shadowtone&quot; exterior paint option became available in a limited range of dark-over-light colour combinations. According to contemporary reviews, changes made to the VC&#x27;s steering produced a heavier feel and inclined understeer, while the revised suspension gave a softer ride and addressed concerns raised while riding fully laden.

=== VH (1981–1984) ===


The VH series Commodore introduced in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, with a new bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, wrap-around chrome rear bumper extensions to the wheel arches, and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.

Mechanical specifications carried over, except for a new five-speed manual transmission, optional on the 1.9-litre four-cylinder and 2.85-litre six-cylinder versions. In an attempt to improve sales figures of the straight-four engine, Holden spent considerable time improving its performance and efficiency. Modifications were also made to the 2.85-litre six to lift economy, and the powerplants managed to reduce fuel consumption by as much as 12.5 and 14 percent, correspondingly. Holden released the sports-oriented Commodore SS sedan in September 1982—reintroducing a nameplate used briefly ten years prior with the HQ series. Provisioned with a choice of 4.2- or optional 5.0-litre V8 engines, both versions of the VH SS were teamed with a four-speed manual transmission. Racing driver Peter Brock&#x27;s Holden Dealer Team (HDT) high performance outfit produced three upgraded versions, known as &quot;Group One&quot;, &quot;Group Two&quot; and &quot;Group Three&quot;, the latter version available in either 4.2-litre or more commonly 5.0-litre V8 configuration.

By the time of the VH series, Commodore sales were beginning to decline. Holden&#x27;s six-cylinder engine, which was carried over from the Kingswood, could trace its roots back to 1963 and was no longer competitive. Continual improvements made to Commodore&#x27;s Ford Falcon rival meant the VH was not significantly more fuel-efficient or better performing despite the smaller size. This was curtailed by the absence of any major powertrain revisions by the time of the VH and the lack of visual departure from the original VB. Holden also had to deal with the influx of their own mid-size Camira from 1982, which presented comparable interior volume with lower fuel consumption, and for less than the Commodore pricing point. Camira sales were strong initially, but as fuel prices had stabilised, buyers gravitated away from Camira and Commodore towards the larger Falcon, which overtook the Commodore as Australia&#x27;s bestselling car for the first time in 1982.

=== VK (1984–1986) ===


Representing the first major change since the VB original, the VK model of 1984 introduced a six-window glasshouse, as opposed to the previous four-window design, to make the Commodore appear larger. The revised design helped stimulate sales, which totalled 135,000 in two years. This did not put an end to Holden&#x27;s monetary woes. Sales of the initially popular Camira slumped due to unforeseen quality issues, while the Holden WB series commercial vehicle range and the Statesman WB luxury models were starting to show their age; their 1971 origins compared unfavourably with Ford&#x27;s more modern Falcon and Fairlane models.

New names for the trim levels were also introduced, such as Commodore Executive (an SL with air conditioning and automatic transmission), Commodore Berlina (replacing SL/X) and Calais (replacing SL/E). The 3.3-litre &quot;Blue&quot; straight-six engine was replaced by the &quot;Black&quot; specification, gaining computer-controlled ignition systems on the carburettor versions and optional electronic fuel injection boosting power output to . The 5.0-litre V8 engine continued to power high specification variants, but was shrunk from 5,044 cc to 4,987 cc in 1985 due to new Group A racing homologation rules. The new car cut its predecessor&#x27;s weight by and models were fitted with an upgraded braking system. As high oil prices became a thing of the past, Holden decided to drop the 2.85- six and 4.2-litre V8, while the 1.9-litre four-cylinder was limited to New Zealand.

=== VL (1986–1988) ===

Marking a high point in terms of sales, the last-of-the-series VL Commodore sold in record numbers, finally managing to outsell the Ford Falcon in the private sector. The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and would be the last of the mid-size Commodores for 30 years. Designers distanced the Commodore further away from its Opel origins, by smoothing the lines of the outer body and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler. A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek, narrow headlamps and a shallower grille, while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps.

By this stage, Holden&#x27;s 24‑year‑old six-cylinder was thoroughly outmoded and would have been difficult to re-engineer to comply with pending emission standards and the introduction of unleaded fuel. This led Holden to sign a deal with Nissan of Japan to import their &quot;RB30E&quot; engine. This seemed a good idea in 1983 when the Australian dollar was strong; however by 1986 the once viable prospect became rather expensive. The public quickly accepted what was at first a controversial move, as reports emerged of the improvements in refinement, 33 percent gain in power and 15 percent better economy over the carburettor version of the VK&#x27;s &quot;Black&quot; straight-six. An optional turbocharger appeared six months later and lifted power output to . In October 1986, an unleaded edition of Holden&#x27;s carburettored V8 engine was publicised. Holden had originally planned to discontinue the V8 to spare the engineering expense of converting to unleaded. However, public outcry persuaded them to relent. VLs in New Zealand, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand were also available with the 2.0-litre six-cylinder &quot;RB20E&quot; engine.

The VL suffered from some common build quality problems, such as poor windshield sealing, that can lead to water leakages and corrosion. Awkward packaging under the low bonnet coupled with Holden&#x27;s decision to utilise a cross-flow radiator (as opposed to the up-down flow radiator installed to the equivalent Nissan Skyline) meant the six-cylinder engine was especially susceptible to cracked cylinder heads, a problem not displayed on the Nissan Skyline with which it shares the &quot;RB30E&quot; engine. The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that first generation Commodores (VB–VL), similarly to the Ford Falcons manufactured during the same years, provide a &quot;worse than average&quot; level of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident. It is perhaps noteworthy however, that the Monash University publication includes in its averages, vehicles manufactured as late as 2006. As such, and with reasonable necessity, the 2008 Used Car Safety Ratings include comparison of some non-airbag vehicles with later vehicles fitted with airbags. In 1988, it would still be some years before airbags became available to the public on vehicles manufactured in Australia, and, outside of the very high end luxury market, available in Australia at all. As airbag technology later become more available, the Holden Commodore would become one of the first to offer the option (see VR Commodore below).

== Second generation (1988–1997)==
=== VN (1988–1991) ===

The VN Commodore of 1988 and subsequent second generation models took their bodywork from the larger Opel Senator B and new Opel Omega A. However, this time, the floor plan was widened and stretched; now matching the rival Ford Falcon for size. Continuing financial woes at Holden meant the wider VN body was underpinned by narrow, carry-over VL chassis components in a bid to save development costs. In Australia, for the VN and succeeding models, the Commodore Berlina became known simply as the Berlina (but in New Zealand the V6 VN Berlina, assembled locally until the Trentham factory was closed in 1990, was badged Executive. The Berlina nameplate was not launched, as a new entry level grade, with trim and equipment equivalent to the Australian V6 Executive, until the locally built four cylinder model, using the Australian-made, Opel designed, two-litre Family Two fuel injected engine, was added some months after the V6s). The range expanded in 1990 to include a utility variant, given the model designation VG. This was built on a longer-wheelbase platform that it shared with the station wagon and luxury VQ Statesman sedans released earlier in the year. During this time, the rival Ford EA Falcon was plagued with initial quality issues which tarnished its reputation. Buyers embraced the VN Commodore, helping Holden to recover and post an operating profit of for 1989. The team at &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine awarded the VN Car of the Year in 1988: the second Commodore model to receive this award.

Changes in the relative values of the Australian dollar and Japanese yen made it financially impractical to continue with the well-regarded Nissan engine of the VL. Instead, Holden manufactured their own 3.8-litre V6 engine based on a Buick design, adapted from FWD to RWD. The 5.0-litre V8 remained optional and received a power boost to courtesy of multi-point fuel injection. Although not known for its refinement, the new V6 was nevertheless praised for its performance and fuel efficiency at the time. The 2.0-litre &quot;Family II&quot; engine offered in New Zealand was also offered in some other export markets including Singapore where the model also was badged Berlina. Accompanying the changes to engines, the VL&#x27;s four-speed automatic transmission was replaced by the &quot;Turbo-Hydramatic&quot; and a Borg-Warner five-speed manual. A Series II update of the VN appeared in September 1989, featuring a revised V6 engine known internally as the &quot;EV6&quot;. With the update came a power hike of rising to from .

Under an unsuccessful model sharing arrangement that was part of the Hawke Labor government reforms in 1989, which saw the formation of the United Australian Automobile Industries alliance between Holden and Toyota Australia, the latter began selling badge engineered versions of the VN Commodore manufactured by Holden. The rebadged Commodores were sold as the &quot;Toyota Lexcen&quot;, named after Ben Lexcen, who was the designer of the Australia II yacht that won the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup. The original T1 Lexcen offered sedan and station wagon body forms in three levels of trim: base, GL and GLX. Moreover, they were only available with a 3.8-litre V6 engine and automatic transmission combination.

=== VP (1991–1993) ===


The VP update of 1991 featured cosmetic and mechanical changes, while carrying over the 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were also a part of the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.

A new wider front track was introduced to address issues with the previous carried-over VL chassis components. In August 1992, anti-lock brakes were introduced as an option on the Calais and SS trim levels, later becoming optional on all Series II variants. This January 1993 update also included a colour-coded grille for the Executive and alloy wheels for the Commodore S.

Toyota&#x27;s pattern of updating their Lexcen model tended to follow Commodore&#x27;s model cycle. The T2 (VP) Lexcen from 1991 pioneered new specification designations: CSi, VXi and Newport. All future updates (T3 (VR), T4 (VS) and T5 (VS II) Lexcens) made use of the new naming system until 1997, when the badge engineering scheme ceased. To give further differentiation to the Lexcen from the Commodore, the Lexcens from the VP model onwards had unique front-end styling treatments.

=== VR (1993–1995) ===


The 1993 VR Commodore represented a major facelift of the second generation architecture leaving only the doors and roof untouched. Approximately 80 percent of car was new in comparison to the preceding model. Exterior changes brought an overall smoother body, semicircular wheel arches and the &quot;twin-kidney&quot; grille—a Commodore styling trait which remained until the VY model of 2002.

The rear-end treatment saw raised tail lights, implemented for safety reasons, and a driver&#x27;s side airbag was introduced as an option: a first for an Australian-built car. Other safety features such as anti-lock brakes and independent rear suspension were only available with the new electronic &quot;GM 4L60-E&quot; automatic transmission. Along with a driver&#x27;s airbag and cruise control, these features were packaged into a new Acclaim specification level: a family-oriented safety spec above the entry-level Executive. Holden&#x27;s strong focus on safety can be seen in the Used Car Safety Ratings. The findings show that in an accident, VN/VP Commodores provide a &quot;worse than average&quot; level of occupant protection. However, the updated VR/VS models were found to provide a &quot;better than average&quot; level of safety protection. Holden issued a Series II revision in September 1994 bringing audible warning chimes for the handbrake and fuel level among other changes.

The latest revision of the Buick 3.8-litre V6 engine was fitted to the VR Commodore, featuring rolling-element bearings in the valve rocker arms and increased compression ratios. These changes combined to deliver an increase in power to and further improvement in noise, vibration, and harshness levels. &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine awarded the VR Commodore Car of the Year in 1993.

=== VS (1995–1997) ===


The 1995 VS Commodore served as a mechanical update of the VR, destined to maintain sales momentum before the arrival of an all-new VT model. The extent of exterior changes amounted to little more than a redesigned Holden logo and wheel trims. An overhauled &quot;Ecotec&quot; (Emissions and Consumption Optimisation through TEChnology) version of the Buick V6 engine coincided with changes to the engine in the United States. The &quot;Ecotec&quot; engine packed 13 percent more power for a total of , cut fuel consumption by 5 percent, increased the compression ratio from 9.0:1 to 9.4:1 and improved on the engine&#x27;s previous rough characteristics. Holden mated the new engine with a modified version of the &quot;GM 4L60-E&quot; automatic transmission, improving throttle response and smoothing gear changes. The Series II update of June 1996 included elliptical side turn signals, interior tweaks and the introduction of a supercharged V6 engine for selected trim levels, and the introduction of a new Getrag manual transmission. The new supercharged engine slotted between the existing V6 and V8 engines in the lineup and was officially rated at , just below the V8.

The VS Commodore was the last to be sold as a Toyota Lexcen, as Holden and Toyota ended their model-sharing scheme. The last Lexcens were built during 1997. This model was also sold as the VS Commodore Royale in New Zealand. Similar in specification to the Calais also sold in New Zealand, the Royale featured a standard VS Commodore body with the front end from the VS Caprice and an Opel 2.6-litre &quot;54-Degree&quot; V6 engine. The Royale was also sold between 1995 and 1997 in small numbers to Malaysia and Singapore as the Opel Calais.

== Third generation (1997–2007)==
=== VT (1997–2000) ===

With the VT Commodore of 1997, Holden looked again to Opel in Germany for a donor platform. The proposal was to take the Opel Omega B and broaden the vehicle&#x27;s width and mechanical setup for local conditions. In the early days, Holden considered adopting the Omega as is, save for the engines and transmissions, and even investigated reskinning the existing VR/VS architecture. Later on, the VT bodywork spawned a new generation of Statesman and Caprice (again based on the long-wheelbase wagons), and even went as far as resurrecting the iconic Monaro coupé of the 1960s and 1970s via a prototype presented at the 1998 Sydney Motor Show.

The VT heralded the fitment of semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension as standard across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as Traction Control. However, in terms of suspension, the original Opel design was simplified by removing the toe control links that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces.

Notably, Holden&#x27;s performance arm HSV re-added the toe control link on the flagship GTS 300 model. The 1999 Series II update replaced the venerable Holden 5.0-litre V8 engine with a new 5.7-litre &quot;Generation III&quot; V8 sourced from the United States. The V8 was detuned to from the original US version, but would receive incremental power upgrades to throughout its time in the Commodore, before finally being replaced by the related &quot;Generation 4&quot; in the VZ. The supercharged V6 was uprated to from the VS. Safety wise, side airbags became an option for the Acclaim and higher models, a first for Holden.

From the onset, parent company General Motors was interested in incorporating a left-hand drive Commodore in its Buick lineup, as manifested by the unveiling of the Buick XP2000 concept car in 1996. Although this idea was ultimately abandoned (due to pressures by the North American automotive trade unions to retain local production), the GM-funded project allowed Holden to enter into a range of left-hand export markets. Thus began the Commodore&#x27;s rapid expansion into parts of Indochina, the Middle East and South Africa badged as the Chevrolet Lumina and Brazil as the Chevrolet Omega 3.8 V6. In its home market, the VT series was awarded the 1997 &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year award, the fourth such award in Commodore&#x27;s history. It found ready acceptance in the market as many buyers steered away from the slow selling Ford AU Falcon, becoming the best selling Commodore to date and cementing its place as number one in Australian sales.

The sedan and wagon range comprised: Commodore Executive (base and fleet package); Commodore Acclaim (family and safety package); Berlina (luxury package) and Calais (sedan-only sport luxury package). Limited editions included a &quot;Sydney 2000&quot; Olympic version and Holden 50th Anniversary based on better equipped Executive models (e.g. Berlina alloy wheels on the former but no climate control).

=== VX (2000–2002) ===

The VX update from 2000 featured a revised headlamp design. The VT&#x27;s rear tail lamp panel was replaced by two separate light assemblies. Conversely, the luxury-oriented Berlina and Calais sedans continued using a full-width boot-lid panel incorporating the registration plate and tail lamps.

The VX series also formed the basis for a new Holden Ute, designated the VU-series. Earlier utility models were instead entitled &quot;Commodore utility&quot;. An updated Series II was launched in early 2002, featuring revised rear suspension system now equipped with toe control links to address the VT&#x27;s issues. The VX series also spawned the production version of the re-launched Holden Monaro (allowing Holden to commence exports to the United States, with this coupé sold as the Pontiac GTO).

Safety played a substantial role in the development of the VX model. Bosch 5.3 anti-lock brakes were made standard on all variants, a first for an Australian manufactured car; and traction control was made available on vehicles equipped with manual transmission. Extensive research was undertaken to reduce the effects from a side-impact collision through modification of the B-pillars. The risk presented by a side-impact collision in a VX fitted without side airbags is reduced by 50 percent when compared to a similarly specified VT model.

=== VY (2002–2004) ===


The VY mid-cycle update of 2002 represented the first major styling shift since the 1997 VT. Designers discarded the rounded front and rear styling of the VT and VX models, adopting more aggressive, angular lines. The same approach was applied to the interior, whereby the curvaceous dashboard design was orphaned in favour of an angular, symmetrical design. Satin chrome plastic now dominated the façade of the centre console stack, and high-end models received fold-out cup holders borrowed from fellow GM subsidiary Saab. Leaving Eurovox behind, Holden turned towards German electronics manufacturer Blaupunkt to source audio systems, an arrangement that remained in place until the end of the Holden brand.

Engineering wise, Holden kept the changes low key. A revised steering system and tweaked suspension tuning were among some of the changes to sharpen handling precision. Further improvements were made to the &quot;Generation III&quot; V8 engine to produce peak power of for sports variants. In a bid to recapture the market for low-cost, high-performance cars, Holden created a new SV8 specification level. Based on the entry-level Executive, the SV8 inherited the V8 mechanical package from the SS but made do without the luxury appointments and was sold at a correspondingly lower price. Holden also experimented by releasing a limited edition wagon version of its high-performance SS variant, of which only 850 were built. The Series II update added a front strut bar as standard to the SS, which was claimed to increase rigidity and hence handling. As became the trend, the update raised V8 power, now up . Amendments in the remaining models were confined to new wheels, trims and decals, however, the Calais has taken on a sports-luxury persona as opposed to the discrete luxury character seen in previous models. This repositioning in turn affected the Berlina&#x27;s standing. The once second-tier model now became the sole luxury model, only overshadowed by the more expensive Calais. Coinciding with the VY II models was the first four-door utility model dubbed the Holden Crewman. Crewman&#x27;s underpinnings and body structure while somewhat unusual, shared a fair amount in common with the Statesman/Caprice, One tonner and the two-door Ute.

In 2003, Holden launched an AWD system that it developed for the VY platform dubbed &quot;Cross Trac&quot;, at a cost of . Unveiled after the Series II updates, the first application of this electronically controlled system was the Holden Adventra, a raised VY wagon crossover. The system was only available in combination with the V8 and automatic transmission. Holden chose not to spend extra engineering resources on adapting the AWD system to the 3.8-litre V6, due to be replaced in the upcoming VZ model. Unfortunately for Holden, the Adventra fell well short of expected sales, despite modest targets.

=== VZ (2004–2007) ===

The final chapter of the third generation series was the VZ Commodore. Debuting in 2004 with a new series of V6 engines known as the &quot;Alloytec V6&quot;, both and versions of the 3.6-litre engine were offered. These were later upgraded to respectively in the VE model. When compared to the previous &quot;Ecotec&quot; engines, the &quot;Alloytec&quot; benefits from increased power output, responsiveness and fuel efficiency. The new engines were mated to a new five-speed &quot;5L40E&quot; automatic transmission on the luxury V6 variants, and a new six-speed &quot;Aisin AY6&quot; manual transmission on the six-cylinder SV6 sports variant. However, the long serving four-speed automatic carried on in other variants, albeit with further tweaks in an attempt to address complaints about refinement. A new 6.0-litre &quot;Generation 4&quot; V8 engine was added to the range in January 2006 to comply with Euro III emission standards. Compared to the American version, both Active Fuel Management and variable valve timing were removed. The &quot;Alloytec&quot; V6 was also affected by the new standards, which saw the peak output reduced to .

Along with the new powertrain, Holden also introduced new safety features such as electronic stability control and brake assist. The Used Car Safety Ratings evaluation found that VT/VX Commodores provide a &quot;better than average&quot; level of occupant protection in the event of an accident, with VY/VZ models uprated to &quot;significantly better than average&quot;. ANCAP crash test results rate the fourth generation VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the third generation VY/VZ Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing model due to improved side impact protection.

== Fourth generation (2006–2017)==

=== VE (2006–2013) ===


Launched in 2006 after GM&#x27;s 2003 abandonment of their last European rear-drive sedan, the Opel Omega, the VE is the first Commodore model designed entirely in Australia, as opposed to being based on an adapted Opel-sourced platform. Given this and high public expectations of quality, the budget in developing the car reportedly exceeded . Underpinned by the new Holden developed GM Zeta platform, the VE features more sophisticated independent suspension all round and near-even 50:50 weight distribution, leading to improved handling. Engines and transmissions are largely carried over from the previous VZ model. However, a new six-speed &quot;GM 6L80-E&quot; automatic transmission was introduced for V8 variants, replacing the original four-speed automatic now relegated to base models. The design of this new model included innovative features to help minimise export costs, such as a symmetrical centre console that houses a flush-fitting hand brake lever to facilitate its conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the Commodore is again badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina and Chevrolet Omega, along with its new export market in the United States as the Pontiac G8 (discontinued as of 2010 along with the Pontiac brand).

Variants by Holden&#x27;s performance arm, HSV, were released soon after the sedan&#x27;s debut, followed by the long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice models. The VE Ute did not enter production until 2007 whilst the Sportwagon began production in July 2008. A VE V8 Calais was awarded &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year, being the fifth Commodore/Calais model to do so.

In late 2008 Holden made changes to the VE Commodore, including the addition of a passenger seatbelt-reminder system. The rollout of such modifications allowed the VE range to be upgraded in stages (dependent on model) to the five-star ANCAP safety rating during 2008 and 2009.

The September 2009 MY10 update to the VE Commodore platform introduces a new standard engine–a 3.0-litre Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) V6 on the Omega and Berlina, with a 3.6-litre version of the same reserved for all other V6 variants. The standard transmission is now a six-speed &quot;GM 6L50&quot; automatic, replacing the four-speed in Omega and Berlina models and the five-speed in higher luxury levels. A six-speed manual is still available in sport models. Holden claims the newer powertrains would provide better fuel economy than some smaller four-cylinder cars; the 3.0-litre version is rated at . The 3.0L produces , more than the earlier 3.6L and more than the old 5.0L Holden V8. The new 3.6 produces a fraction more at although the difference is negligible in real world driving.

In mid-2010 Holden released the VE Series 2 (VEII). The major difference saw the introduction of the Holden iQ system, a centre-mounted LCD display that provides navigation, Bluetooth, and controls to the stereo. There were also small alterations to the styling and a number of other changes.

=== VF (2013–2017) ===

The VF Commodore, a major overhaul of the VE, was officially revealed on 10 February 2013 in Melbourne.

The body shell, suspension and electrics of the GM Zeta platform were thoroughly reworked to reduce weight, improving handling and fuel efficiency. Changes to the model line-up saw the deletion of the Berlina nameplate (which was merged with the standard Calais variant, represented the smallest share of sales in Commodore&#x27;s line-up) and the base model renamed from Omega to Evoke.

Standard features across the Commodore range includes front and rear parking sensors, reverse camera and auto park assist, whereas high specifications models such as the Calais-V and SS-V redline models also feature, as standard, forward and reverse collision alert system and a colour heads-up display - all possible thanks to the VF&#x27;s electronics now being compatible with those of more developed GM cars, resulting in the new Commodore being cheaper to manufacture. Indeed, the recommended retail pricing was substantially reduced across the range, from for the base model and up to for the Calais V V8 and SS V Redline.

A day after the Australian range reveal and in the lead up to the Daytona 500 weekend, a more powerful and better equipped export version of the VF Commodore SS also made its debut in Daytona, Florida, as the MY14 Chevrolet SS. To maximise the SS&#x27;s profile in the United States, GM also replaced in NASCAR the Chevrolet Impala with the SS, which raced in NASCAR&#x27;s premier series through 2017, when it was replaced by the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 for the 2018 season.

A Series II update (VF II) was launched in late 2015, introducing minor styling revisions at the front, while the biggest change was the arrival of a &quot;LS3&quot; across the entire V8 range. In addition, the V8&#x27;s final drive ratio and the Redline&#x27;s suspension tune were also revised.

== Fifth generation (2018–2020)==
=== ZB (2018–2020) ===


In 2017, Holden announced that the Commodore would end production in Australia and confirmed that the Commodore badge would be inherited by its replacement – now fully imported. That decision was made on the basis of a survey revealing that a majority of customers were in favour of retaining the long-standing Australian badge, introduced in 1978.

In October 2016, Holden provided selected journalists an opportunity to test drive early prototypes of the 2018 Commodore.

The ZB Commodore was revealed on 6 December 2016, as a rebadged version of the Opel Insignia B. The ZB Commodore was offered with four or six-cylinder engine options, as well as front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive. This was a major departure from the V8 and rear-wheel drive variants available on the previous generation Commodore.

There was significant controversy regarding Holden&#x27;s decision to retain the Commodore name for the 2018 model, despite it being considerably smaller than its predecessor and lacking both the traditional V8 engine and rear-wheel drive configuration. The decision was considered to be a safe choice in order to preserve sales, but the retention of the long-respected Commodore name was criticised for missing the opportunity to re-brand the sedan range and push the vehicle into the more lucrative semi-premium segment of the market.

, the ZB Commodore had the lowest resale value, as a proportion of its new price, of any car on the Australian market.

Due to slow sales and Holden&#x27;s interest in other vehicle segments, it was announced on 10 December 2019 that the ZB Commodore would be discontinued in early 2020, shortly before GM&#x27;s decision to retire the Holden brand entirely.

== Australian export models ==
Since the late 1990s, Commodores have been sent abroad as the Chevrolet Lumina in the Middle East until 2011 and South Africa until 2013, and as the Chevrolet Omega in Brazil until 2008 and, then again, in 2010. Vauxhall VXR8 sales began in 2007. Versions have also been previously exported in the mid-1990s to Southeast Asia as the Opel Calais and to North America from 2008 to 2009 as the Pontiac G8. From 2014 to 2017, the VF Commodore was sold in the United States as the Chevrolet SS and the sport version from HSV sold in the United Kingdom as the Vauxhall VXR8.

=== Chevrolet Lumina ===
The Commodore was sold as the Chevrolet Lumina in the Middle East and South Africa, and previously in South East Asia.

A coupe version based on the Holden Monaro was also sold in the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina Coupe. In Arabia, the Lumina was offered in four different trims: LS (Omega), LTZ (Berlina), S (SV6) and SS (SS). The LTZ and S came standard with a 3.6 L Alloytec V6 and a six-speed automatic transmission for the S and four-speed for the LTZ, while the SS came standard with a 6.0 L Alloytec V8 with the option of active fuel management. A six-speed manual was standard with the option of a six-speed automatic on the SS. The LTZ was the luxury model, while the S and SS models focused on sportiness. Exports to the Middle East ceased in 2011.

Lumina models sold in South Africa dropped the V6 engine in favour of 6.0 litre V8 engine mated to a six-speed manual or automatic. Fuel injection and a 10.4:1 compression ratio help contribute to a max power output of at 5,700 rpm, and a max torque of at 4,400 rpm for vehicles equipped with the manual. Automatic cars make at 5,800 rpm and at 4,400 rpm. All cars were equipped with Brembo brake calipers and a ZF limited-slip differentials. The car received updates for the 2011 model year. These changes were introduced to coincide with the release of the VE Series II Commodore. Changes included revised bumpers, there is a chrome moulding above the number plate on the boot lid, refreshed alloy wheel designs and the Holden IQ system. Also the SSV model was introduced. The Holden Ute was sold as the &quot;Lumina Ute&quot; in South Africa and has the same equipment as the sedan.

== Australian production ==
Australian production of the first Commodore launched in 1978 was initially spread between Holden&#x27;s Pagewood (New South Wales) and Dandenong (Victoria) plants. In August 1978, Holden announced a $6.7 million program to enable assembly of the Commodore range at the Elizabeth (South Australia) plant, which resulted in the closure of the Pagewood plant a year later. The Australian production of the Commodore was consolidated at Elizabeth in 1988, coinciding with the launch of the then new VN Commodore.

The Commodore and its derivatives have been the basis of modified variants by companies separate to Holden. Officially, Holden&#x27;s performance partner is HSV, although other prominent high performance brands include HDT Special Vehicles, Corsa Specialized Vehicles (CSV) and Walkinshaw Performance (WP), since the first, third and fourth generation Commodore, respectively.

In December 2013, Holden announced that it would cease production of the Commodore in Australia in 2017. This was followed, in December 2015, by &quot;Project Erich&quot; involving Belgian entrepreneur Guido Dumarey. His plans involve buying the Holden production facilities, with a view to continue producing in Australia a rebadged range of RWD and AWD premium vehicles based on the GM Zeta platform, for local and export sales. Dumarey&#x27;s company, Punch Powerglide, already supplies automatic transmissions for Holden&#x27;s V6-powered models made in Australia. The last Commodore - the last Holden vehicle to be manufactured in Australia - rolled off the line at the Elizabeth plant on 20 October 2017.

<doc id="305473" wikidata="Q190094" url="?curid=305473" title="Allen Iverson">
<text>Allen Ezail Iverson ( ; born June 7, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player. Nicknamed &quot;the Answer&quot;, he played 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as both a shooting guard and point guard. As an NBA rookie with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1997, Iverson was named NBA Rookie of the Year. He was an 11-time NBA All-Star, won the All-Star Game MVP Award in 2001 and 2005, and was the NBA&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2001. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016. In October 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. Iverson is regarded as one of the game&#x27;s greatest scorers, ball handlers, guards, and among the most influential athletes in all of American sports.

Iverson attended Bethel High School in Hampton, Virginia, and was a dual-sport athlete. He earned the Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both football and basketball, and won the Division 5 AAA Virginia state championship in both sports. After high school, Iverson played college basketball with the Georgetown Hoyas for two years, where he set the school record for career scoring average (23.0 points per game) and won the Big East Defensive Player of the Year award both years.

Following two successful years at Georgetown University, Iverson declared eligibility for the 1996 NBA draft, and was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick. He was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in the 1996–97 season. A four-time scoring champion, winning the NBA scoring title during the 1998–99, 2000–01, 2001–02, and 2004–05 seasons, Iverson was one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, despite his relatively small stature (listed at 6 feet, 0 inches, or 183 centimeters). His regular season career scoring average of 26.7 points per game ranks seventh all-time, and his playoff career scoring average of 29.7 points per game trails only Michael Jordan and Luka Dončić. Iverson was also the NBA Most Valuable Player of the 2000–01 season, and led his team to the 2001 NBA Finals the same season. Iverson represented the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal.

Later in his career, Iverson played for the Denver Nuggets, Detroit Pistons, and the Memphis Grizzlies, before ending his NBA career with the 76ers during the 2009–10 season. He was rated the fifth-greatest NBA shooting guard of all time by ESPN in 2008. He finished his career in Turkey with Beşiktaş in 2011. He returned as a player-coach for 3&#x27;s Company in the inaugural season of the BIG3.

==Early life==
Iverson was born in Hampton, Virginia, to a single 15-year-old mother, Ann Iverson. His father, Allen Broughton, was not involved in raising him.

During his early childhood years in Hampton, Iverson was given the nickname &quot;Bubba Chuck&quot;. A childhood friend, Jaime Rogers, said that Iverson would always &quot;look out for the younger kids&quot; and that &quot;he could teach anybody.&quot; When Iverson was 13, father figure Michael Freeman was arrested in front of Iverson for dealing drugs. Iverson then failed the eighth grade because of excessive absences and moved to get out of the projects.

He attended Bethel High School, where he started as quarterback for the school football team while also playing running back, kick returner, and defensive back. He also started at point guard for the school basketball team. During his junior year, Iverson was able to lead both teams to Virginia state championships, and was awarded the Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both sports.

Iverson played for the &quot;Boo&quot; Williams-led AAU basketball team and won the 1992 17-and-under AAU national championship. This team was coached by Williams, who has been credited by Iverson as his most inspirational coach of all time.

===Incarceration===
On February 14, 1993, Iverson and several of his friends were involved in an altercation with several other patrons at a bowling alley in Hampton, Virginia. Allegedly, Iverson&#x27;s crowd was raucous and had to be asked to quiet down several times, and eventually a shouting duel began with another group of youths. Shortly after that a fight erupted, pitting the white crowd against the black crowd. During the fight Iverson allegedly struck a woman in the head with a chair. He and three of his friends, who were also black, were the only people arrested. Iverson, who was 17 at the time, was convicted as an adult of the felony charge of maiming by mob, a rarely used Virginia statute that was designed to combat lynching. A videotape surfaced of the incident that shows Iverson leaving shortly after the fighting began. Of the incident, Iverson said: &quot;For me to be in a bowling alley where everybody in the whole place know who I am and be crackin&#x27; people upside the head with chairs and think nothin&#x27; gonna happen? That&#x27;s crazy! And what kind of a man would I be to hit a girl in the head with a damn chair? I rather have &#x27;em say I hit a man with a chair, not no damn woman.&quot;

Iverson was sentenced to 15 years in prison with 10 years suspended. After he spent four months at Newport News City Farm, a correctional facility in Newport News, he was granted clemency by Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder, and the Virginia Court of Appeals eventually overturned the conviction in 1995 for insufficient evidence. This incident and its impact on the community is explored in the documentary film &quot;No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson&quot;. Iverson&#x27;s high school basketball coach stated: &quot;They wanted to make an example out of Iverson.&quot; James Elleson, Iverson&#x27;s lawyer, said: &quot;Only defendants not given bond are capital murderers.&quot; Tom Brokaw and the public played a huge role in the release of Iverson. There were rallies and marches for all four black men who were incarcerated, and Brokaw did a special interview with Iverson from the jail. In this special, Iverson was very apologetic and somber. Brokaw even said: &quot;I thought the sentence was surprisingly harsh.&quot;

Of his time in prison, Iverson said: &quot;I had to use the whole jail situation as something positive. Going to jail, someone sees something weak in you, they&#x27;ll exploit it. I never showed any weakness. I just kept going strong until I came out.&quot; The prison sentence forced him to complete his senior year of high school at Richard Milburn High School, a school for at-risk students, instead of competing in sports at Bethel. However, the three years Iverson spent at Bethel were enough to convince Georgetown University head coach John Thompson to come out and meet Iverson, and offer him a full scholarship to join the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team.

==College career==
In his first season at Georgetown in 1994–95, Iverson won the Big East Rookie of the Year award and was named to the All Rookie Tournament First Team. That season, Iverson averaged 20.4 points and led the Hoyas to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to the North Carolina Tar Heels.

In his second and final season at Georgetown in 1995–96, Iverson led the team to a Big East championship and all the way to the Elite Eight round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to the Massachusetts Minutemen. He ended his college career as the Hoyas&#x27; all-time leader in career scoring average, at 22.9 points per game. Iverson was named as a first-team All-American. Iverson was also named the Big East Defensive Player of the Year in each of his two seasons at Georgetown.

Following his sophomore year, Iverson declared for the 1996 NBA draft. He was the first player under Coach Thompson to leave Georgetown early for the NBA.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia 76ers (1996–2006)===
====Early years (1996–2000)====

After two seasons at Georgetown, Iverson was selected with the 1st overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft to the Philadelphia 76ers. Listed at tall, he became the shortest first overall pick ever, in a league normally dominated by taller players.

Iverson came to a Philadelphia team that had just finished the previous season with a dismal 18–64 record. In his NBA debut, Iverson recorded 30 points and 6 assists on a 103–111 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. He tied Willie Anderson for the third highest scoring output by a rookie guard in his debut. On November 12, 1996, Iverson recorded a then career-high of 35 points to go along with 7 rebounds, 6 assists and 2 steals on a 101–97 road win over the New York Knicks. In a game against the 55–8 Chicago Bulls, Iverson scored 37 points and memorably crossed over Michael Jordan. He broke Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s rookie record of three straight games with at least 40 points, doing so in five straight games, including a 50-point effort in Cleveland against the Cavaliers. Averaging 23.5 points per game, 7.5 assists per game and 2.1 steals per game for the season, Iverson was named the NBA Rookie of the Year. Iverson was only able to help the Sixers to a 22–60 record in 1996–97.

Aided by the arrivals of Theo Ratliff, Eric Snow, Larry Hughes, Aaron McKie, and new coach Larry Brown, Iverson continued to help the 76ers move forward the following season, as they improved nine games to finish 31–51. During their time together in Philadelphia, Iverson and fellow guard Hughes were nicknamed &quot;the Flight Brothers&quot;, for their above-the-rim and athletic play style.

On January 26, 1999, Iverson signed a six-year, $70.9 million max contract extension. The lockout-shortened 1998–1999 season would mark great improvement for the 76ers. Iverson averaged 26.8 points (which led the league, earning his first scoring title) and was named to his first All-NBA First Team. The Sixers finished the season at 28–22, earning Iverson his first trip to the playoffs. He started all ten playoff games and averaged 28.5 points per game despite being hampered by a number of nagging injuries. Iverson led the Sixers to an upset over the number three seeded Orlando Magic in four games, before losing to the Indiana Pacers in the second round in six games.

During the 1999–2000 NBA season, the Sixers would continue to improve under Iverson&#x27;s leadership, as they finished 49–33, once again qualifying for the playoffs (this time earning the fifth seed, one spot higher than the previous year&#x27;s sixth seed). In the playoffs, Iverson averaged 26.2 points, 4.8 assists, 4 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. Philadelphia would advance past the Charlotte Hornets in the opening round, but was eliminated by Indiana in the second round in six games for the second straight year.

That season, Iverson was selected to the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the first time of what would be 11 straight selections. He was the only player other than Shaquille O&#x27;Neal to receive an MVP vote that year. In the 2000 off-season, the 76ers actively tried to trade Iverson after his numerous disagreements with then-coach Larry Brown, and had agreed to terms with the Detroit Pistons before Matt Geiger, who was included in the deal, refused to forfeit his $5 million trade kicker.

====MVP season and trip to the NBA Finals (2000–2001)====
During the 2000–01 season, Iverson led his team to a franchise record 10–0 start to the season, and was named a starter at the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, where he won the game MVP. The Sixers posted a 56–26 record on the season, the best in the Eastern Conference, earning the top seed. Iverson also averaged a then-career-high 31.1 points, winning his second NBA scoring title in the process. At the same time, Iverson won the NBA steals title with 2.5 a game. Iverson was named NBA Most Valuable Player; at 6 feet and 165 pounds, he became the shortest and lightest player to win the MVP award. He had 93 first-place votes out of a possible 124. He was also named to the All NBA First team for his accomplishments. On top of Iverson&#x27;s awards, recently acquired big man Dikembe Mutombo won NBA Defensive Player of the Year, fellow guard Aaron McKie won Sixth Man of the Year, and Larry Brown won the NBA Coach of the Year, all of which contributed hugely to the Sixers&#x27; success that year on top of Iverson. In the playoffs, Iverson and the Sixers defeated the Indiana Pacers in the first round, before meeting Vince Carter-led Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Semifinals. The series went the full seven games. In the next round, the Sixers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, also in seven games, to advance to the 2001 NBA Finals against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, featuring the duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.

Iverson led the Sixers to their first finals since their 1983 championship. In game one of the 2001 NBA Finals, Iverson scored a playoff-high 48 points and beat the heavily favored Lakers 107–101; it was the Lakers&#x27; only playoff loss that year. In the game, he notably stepped over Tyronn Lue after hitting a crucial shot. Iverson would go on to score 23, 35, 35, and 37 in games 2–5, all losing efforts though the Sixers were not swept like many predicted. Iverson enjoyed his most successful season as an individual and as a member of the Sixers during the 2000–01 NBA season.

Iverson began using a basketball sleeve during this season during his recovery from bursitis in his right elbow. Other players, including Carmelo Anthony and Kobe Bryant, adopted the sleeves as well, as did fans who wore the sleeve as a fashion statement. Iverson continued wearing his sleeve long after his elbow had healed. Some believed that the sleeve improved Iverson&#x27;s shooting ability. Steven Kotler of &quot;Psychology Today&quot; suggested that such sleeves may act as a placebo to prevent future injuries.

After the 2001 Season came to a close, Allen Iverson decided to partner with Reebok and signed a 10-year $50 million contract. This contract also included $800,000 annually and access to a 32 million dollar trust fund when he turns 55. 

====Early playoff exits and Larry Brown&#x27;s departure (2001–2003)====

Fresh off their trip to the NBA Finals, Iverson and the Sixers entered the 2001–2002 season with high expectations, but were plagued by injuries, and only able to muster a 43–39 record to barely get into the playoffs. Despite playing in only 60 games that season and being hampered by injuries, Iverson averaged 31.4 points per game to earn his second consecutive scoring title. The 76ers lost to the Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs 3–2 in the five-game series. After the defeat, Brown criticized Iverson for missing team practices. Iverson responded by saying, &quot;We sittin&#x27; here, I&#x27;m supposed to be a franchise player, and we in here talkin&#x27; about practice,&quot; and went on a rant that included the word &quot;practice&quot; 22 times. He repeatedly said &quot;We talkin&#x27; about practice. Not a game.&quot;

The 2002–2003 season started off poorly for the Sixers, who had just traded defensive-standout Dikembe Mutombo to New Jersey, and saw a decrease in both offensive and defensive production from Aaron McKie and Eric Snow, all three of whom were key components to their Finals appearance two years prior. Iverson would once again put up stellar scoring numbers (27.6 points per game) however, and the Sixers regrouped following the All-Star break to make the playoffs with a 48–34 record. They were able to defeat Baron Davis and the New Orleans Hornets in the opening round of the playoffs. Iverson later described Davis as the most difficult opposing point guard to defend in his career. In the six-game second round series, the 76ers were eliminated by the Detroit Pistons.

Head Coach Larry Brown left the 76ers in 2003, following the playoff loss. After his departure from the 76ers, both he and Iverson indicated that the two were on good terms and genuinely fond of one another. Iverson later reunited with Brown when Iverson became the co-captain of the 2004 United States men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team. In 2005, Iverson said that Brown was without a doubt &quot;the best coach in the world&quot;.

====Disappointment and frustration (2003–2006)====

Randy Ayers became the next coach of the 76ers, but failed to develop any chemistry with his players, and was fired following a 21–31 start to the season. During the latter part of the 2003–04 NBA season, Iverson bristled under the disciplinarian approach of the Sixers&#x27; interim head coach Chris Ford. This led to a number of contentious incidents, including Iverson being suspended for missing practice, fined for failing to notify Ford that he would not attend a game because he was sick, and refusing to play in a game because he felt &quot;insulted&quot; that Ford wanted Iverson to come off the bench as he worked his way back from an injury. Iverson missed a then-career-high 34 games in a disastrous season that saw the Sixers miss the postseason for the first time since 1998.

The 2004–2005 season saw Iverson and the Sixers bounce back under the tutelage of new head coach Jim O&#x27;Brien, and additions of their first round draft pick Andre Iguodala, and All-Star forward Chris Webber, who was acquired in a mid-season trade.

On February 12, 2005, Iverson scored a career-high 60 points on 24-for-27 shooting from the free throw line to go along with 6 assists and 5 steals in a 112–99 win over the Orlando Magic. On April 8, 2005, Iverson recorded 23 points, 7 rebounds and a career-high 16 assists in a 103–98 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.

A rejuvenated Iverson won his fourth NBA scoring title with 31 points and averaged 8 assists for the year, and helped the 76ers climb back into the postseason with a 43–39 record. They would go on to lose to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons, who were led by Larry Brown, in the first round. In the series, Iverson had three double-doubles, including a 37-point, 15-assist performance in Philadelphia&#x27;s lone win of the series.

Despite O&#x27;Brien helping the team back into the postseason, disagreements with players and management led to his firing after just one season. He was replaced by Sixers&#x27; legend Maurice Cheeks, in a personnel move Iverson praised, as Cheeks had been an assistant coach with the team when they reached the NBA Finals in 2001. During the 2005–2006 season, Iverson averaged a career-high 33.0 points per game. The Sixers, however, missed the playoffs for the second time in three years.

On April 18, 2006, Iverson and Chris Webber arrived late to the Sixers&#x27; fan appreciation night and home game finale. Players were expected to report 90 minutes before game time, but both Iverson and Webber arrived around tipoff. Coach Maurice Cheeks notified the media that neither would be playing, and general manager Billy King announced that Iverson and Webber would be fined. During the 2006 off-season, trade rumors had Iverson going to Denver, Atlanta, or Boston. None of the deals were completed. Iverson had made it clear that he would like to stay a Sixer.

Iverson and the Sixers began the 2006–07 NBA season at 3–0 before stumbling out to a 5–10 record through 15 games. Following the disappointing start, Iverson reportedly demanded a trade from the Sixers (which he denied). As a result, Iverson was told he would not play in any more games. During the following game against the Washington Wizards, which was televised nationally on ESPN, Sixers Chairman Ed Snider confirmed the trade rumors by stating &quot;We&#x27;re going to trade him. At a certain point, you have to come to grips with the fact that it&#x27;s not working. He wants out and we&#x27;re ready to accommodate him.&quot;

Iverson ended his 10-year Philadelphia tenure with the highest scoring average in team history (28.1), and is second all-time on the points list (19,583), and the Sixers did not win another playoff series after his departure until 2012.

===Denver Nuggets (2006–2008)===

On December 19, 2006, the Philadelphia 76ers sent Iverson and forward Ivan McFarlin to the Denver Nuggets for Andre Miller, Joe Smith, and two first-round picks in the 2007 NBA draft. At the time of the trade, Iverson was the NBA&#x27;s number two leading scorer, with new teammate Carmelo Anthony being number one.

On December 23, 2006, Iverson played his first game for the Nuggets. He had 22 points and 10 assists in a losing effort to the Sacramento Kings. In his first year as a Nugget they made the playoffs. They won the first game and lost the next four to the San Antonio Spurs.

Iverson was fined $25,000 by the NBA for criticizing referee Steve Javie following a game between the Nuggets and Iverson&#x27;s former team, the Philadelphia 76ers, played January 2, 2007. During the game, he committed two technical fouls and was ejected from the game. After the game, Iverson said, &quot;I thought I got fouled on that play, and I said I thought that he was calling the game personal I should have known that I couldn&#x27;t say anything anyway. It&#x27;s been something personal with me and him since I got in the league. This was just the perfect game for him to try and make me look bad.&quot;

Former referee Tim Donaghy supported the claim that Javie had a longstanding hatred for Iverson in his book, &quot;Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal that Rocked the NBA&quot;, which a Florida business group published through a self-publishing arm of Amazon after it was dropped by a division of Random House, who cited liability issues after reviewing the manuscript.

In a December 2009 interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Donaghy said he and fellow referees thought the punishment was too light. Before Iverson&#x27;s Nuggets played the Utah Jazz on January 6, 2007, Donaghy said he and the two other officials working the game agreed not to give Iverson favorable calls as a way to &quot;teach him a lesson.&quot; Iverson attempted 12 free throws, more than any other player on either team. On 12 drives to the basket, he drew five fouls, three of which Donaghy whistled himself, and did not receive a call on one play in which Utah&#x27;s Mehmet Okur clearly fouled him.

Iverson returned to Philadelphia on March 19, 2008, to a sell-out crowd and received a standing ovation after scoring a game-leading 32 points in a 115–113 loss.

===Detroit Pistons (2008–2009)===

On November 3, 2008, Iverson was dealt from the Denver Nuggets to the Detroit Pistons for guard Chauncey Billups, forward Antonio McDyess and center Cheikh Samb. Due to Rodney Stuckey already wearing Iverson&#x27;s preferred #3 jersey, Iverson switched to number 1 for the Pistons, which Billups previously wore for the team.

Iverson scored at least 24 in four of his first five games with Detroit (they won 3 of the 5), and would score 20 or more with 6 or more assists on a consistent basis, but as the season wore on, he would lose playing time to Rodney Stuckey. Some speculated that Pistons President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars did not envision a long-term role for Iverson on the team, but traded for him to make Stuckey the point guard of the future and free cap space with Iverson&#x27;s expiring contract.

On April 3, 2009, it was announced that Iverson would not play the remainder of the 2008–09 season. Dumars cited Iverson&#x27;s ongoing back injury as the reason for his deactivation, although two days prior Iverson stated publicly that he&#x27;d rather retire than be moved to the bench as Pistons coach Michael Curry had decided.

=== Memphis Grizzlies (2009) ===
On September 10, 2009, Iverson signed a one-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies. He stated that &quot;God chose Memphis as the place that I will continue my career,&quot; and that &quot;I feel that they are committed to developing a winner.&quot;

However, Iverson again expressed his displeasure at being a bench player, and left the team on November 7, 2009, for &quot;personal reasons.&quot; On November 16, the Grizzlies announced the team terminated his contract by &quot;mutual agreement.&quot; He played three games for the Grizzlies, averaging 12.3 ppg, 1.3 rpg, and 3.7 apg in 22.3 mpg.

===Return to the 76ers (2009–2010)===

On November 25, 2009, analyst Stephen A. Smith published on his blog a statement attributed to Iverson announcing plans for retirement, which also said, &quot;I feel strongly that I can still compete at the highest level.&quot;

Less than a week later on November 30, Iverson and his representatives met with a Philadelphia 76ers delegation about returning to his former team, and accepted a contract offer two days later. General manager Ed Stefanski declined to go into the terms of the agreement, but an unnamed source told the Associated Press that Iverson agreed to a one-year non-guaranteed contract at the league minimum salary. Iverson would receive a prorated portion of the $1.3 million minimum salary for players with at least 10 years of experience, and the contract would become guaranteed for the remainder of the 2009–10 season if he remained on the roster on January 8, 2010. Stefanski said the team made the decision to pursue Iverson after starting guard Lou Williams suffered a broken jaw and was expected to miss at least 30 games.

On December 7, 2009, Iverson made his return to Philadelphia, garnering a thunderous ovation from the sold-out crowd, in a loss against his former team, the Denver Nuggets. He finished the game with 11 points, 6 assists, 5 rebounds, a steal, and no turnovers. Iverson&#x27;s first win in his return to Philadelphia came one week later, in a 20-point effort against the Golden State Warriors, ending the Sixers&#x27; 12-game losing streak (which stood at 9 games before Iverson returned). He shot 70 percent from the field in the game.

On January 3, 2010, he returned to Denver to face the Nuggets; Iverson scored 17 points and had seven assists in the 108–105 win. He was voted as a starter for the All-Star Game for the 11th straight season. He scored a season-high 23 points (on 56% shooting from the field) in a 99–91 loss to Kobe Bryant and the defending champion Lakers.

On February 22, 2010, Iverson left the 76ers indefinitely, citing the need to attend to his 4-year-old daughter Messiah&#x27;s health issues, which he revealed years later as Kawasaki Disease. On March 2, Stefanski announced Iverson would not return to the 76ers for the rest of the season to deal with the personal matter. His final NBA game was a road loss against Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls on February 20, 2010.

===Beşiktaş (2010–2011)===
On October 26, 2010, Yahoo! Sports reported that Iverson agreed in principle to a two-year, $4 million net income contract with Beşiktaş, a Turkish Super League team competing in the second-tier level of pan-European professional basketball, the EuroCup, the competition level below the EuroLeague level. The club announced the signing at a press conference in New York City, on October 29, 2010. Wearing jersey No. 4, Iverson made his debut for Beşiktaş on November 16, 2010, in a EuroCup 91–94 loss to Serbian side Hemofarm. Iverson scored 15 points in 23 minutes.

Iverson returned to the United States in January 2011 for calf surgery. He only played ten games for Beşiktaş that season, and did not play professional basketball after that.

===Official retirement===
In January 2013, Iverson received an offer to play for the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League, but he declined.

On October 30, 2013, Iverson announced his retirement from basketball, citing he lost his desire to play. At the 76ers 2013–14 season home opener that night, he received a standing ovation at the beginning of the second quarter. The news conference at which he announced his retirement was attended by former Georgetown coach John Thompson and Sixers great Julius Erving. Iverson said he would always be a Sixer &quot;until I die,&quot; and that while he always thought the day he retired would be a &quot;tough&quot; day, he instead stated it was rather a &quot;happy&quot; day.

In November 2013, the 76ers announced that they would officially retire Iverson&#x27;s number 3 in a special halftime ceremony on March 1, 2014, when the Sixers hosted the Washington Wizards. The ceremony took place in front of 20,000 spectators and 76ers greats such as Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and former team president Pat Croce. He headlined the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2016 along with Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Yao Ming. Iverson highlighted John Thompson and Larry Brown when speaking to the media on who he credited for a Hall of Fame career.

In 2017, the creation of the 3-on-3 professional basketball league BIG3 was announced, with Iverson set to be a player and coach on 3&#x27;s Company. In March, it was announced that Iverson&#x27;s co-captain would be DerMarr Johnson. 3&#x27;s Company drafted Andre Owens, Mike Sweetney, and Ruben Patterson during the 2017 BIG3 Draft. On June 25, 3&#x27;s Company played its first game of the inaugural BIG3 season against the Ball Hogs. In the game, Iverson scored 2 points on 1-for-6 shooting in 9 minutes of play. On only playing 9 minutes, Iverson stated, &quot;I signed up to be a coach, player and captain. Coach part is going to go on throughout the game. Playing part is not going to be what you expect. You&#x27;re not going to see the Allen Iverson of old out there.&quot;

==National team career==
===1995 World University Games===

Iverson was a member of the USA World University Games Team in Japan in 1995, that included future NBA stars Ray Allen and Tim Duncan, and others. Iverson led all USA players in scoring, assists, and steals, averaging 16.7 points, 6.1 assists, and 2.9 steals per game. He helped lead the team to an undefeated record en route to a 141–81 victory over the host country, Japan, for the gold medal.

===2003 FIBA Americas championship===
Iverson was selected to be part of Team USA for the 2003 FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Puerto Rico in August of that year. USA had a perfect 10–0 record, and won the gold medal as well as qualifying for a berth in the 2004 Olympics. Iverson started all eight games that he played in, and was second on the team with 14.3 points per game, while also posting 3.8 assists per game, 2.5 rebounds per game, 1.6 steals per game, and shooting 56.2 percent (41–73 FGs) from the field, 53.6 percent (15–28 3pt FGs) from 3-point and 81.0 percent (17–21 FTs) from the foul line.

In the USA&#x27;s 111–71 victory over Canada on August 25, he accounted for a USA Olympic Qualifying single-game record 28 points and made a single-game record seven 3-pointers. Playing just 23 minutes, he shot 10-for-13 overall, 7-for-8 from the 3-point line, 1-for-1 from the foul line and added three assists, three steals, and one rebound. All seven of his 3-point field goals were made during the final 7:41 of the third quarter.

He finished the tournament ranked overall tied for 10th in scoring, tied for fourth in steals, fifth in 3-point percentage, tied for seventh in assists, and ninth in field goal percentage (.562). Iverson also missed the USA&#x27;s final two games because of a sprained right thumb which was suffered in the first half of the August 28 Puerto Rico game. In a game against Puerto Rico, he recorded 9 points on 4-for-6 shooting from the field overall, and added five assists and three rebounds in 26 minutes of action in the USA&#x27;s 101–74 exhibition game victory on August 17 in New York. He was also named to the 2003 USA Senior National Team on April 29, 2003.

==Personal life==

Iverson has three younger half-siblings: Brandy (b. 1979), Ieisha (b. 1990), and Mister (b. 2003).

During the 2000 offseason, Iverson recorded a rap single called &quot;40 Bars&quot;. However, after being criticized for its controversial lyrics, he eventually was unable to release it. Going under his moniker, &quot;Jewelz&quot;, the album was alleged to have made derogatory remarks about homosexuals. After criticism from activist groups and NBA Commissioner David Stern, he agreed to change the lyrics, but ultimately never released the album.

Iverson had an on-again, off-again relationship with rapper Da Brat. Da Brat claimed she ended the relationship due to Iverson&#x27;s infidelity.

On May 14, 2015, Iverson appeared on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; in support of a Showtime Network documentary on his life, &quot;Iverson&quot;, during which he addressed long-discussed rumors of financial struggles, denying any notion that he was struggling. &quot;That&#x27;s a myth. That&#x27;s a rumor... The fact that I&#x27;m struggling in any part of my life&quot;, he said.

In 2021, Iverson and former NBA player Al Harrington announced a business partnership through which a line of cannabis products would be launched named &quot;The Iverson Collection&quot;. Iverson will also aid in the development of various business initiatives for the company that Harrington founded, Viola Brands. The pair will also collaborate on educational efforts to reduce stigma surrounding cannabis use.

In October 2023, Iverson was named Reebok&#x27;s Vice President of Basketball.

===Legal troubles===
In August 1997, during the offseason, Iverson and his friends were stopped by a police officer for speeding late at night. He was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and for possession of marijuana. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to community service.

In 2002, Iverson was alleged to have thrown his wife Tawanna out of their home after a domestic dispute and later threatening two men with a gun while looking for her. All charges against him were later dropped after the judge cited lack of evidence with contradictory statements from witnesses.

On February 24, 2004, Iverson urinated in a trash can at Bally&#x27;s Atlantic City casino and was told by casino management not to return.

On December 9, 2005, after the Sixers defeated the Charlotte Bobcats, Iverson paid a late-night visit to the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. After winning a hand at a three-card-stud poker table, Iverson was overpaid $10,000 in chips by a dealer. When the dealer quickly realized the mistake and requested the chips back, Iverson refused, and a heated head-turning argument between him and the casino staff began. Atlantic City casino regulations reportedly state that when a casino makes a payout mistake in favor of the gambler, the gambler must return the money that they did not legitimately win.

Also in 2005, Iverson&#x27;s bodyguard Jason Kane was accused of assaulting a man at a Washington, D.C. nightclub after the man, Marlin Godfrey, refused to leave the club&#x27;s VIP section so Iverson&#x27;s entourage could enter. Godfrey suffered a concussion, a ruptured eardrum, a burst blood vessel in his eye, a torn rotator cuff, cuts and bruises, and emotional distress. Although Iverson did not touch Godfrey himself, Godfrey sued Iverson for the injuries caused by his bodyguard. In 2007, a jury awarded Godfrey $260,000. In March 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the verdict on appeal.

In August 2011, an Ohio man sued Iverson for $2.5 million in damages, claiming Iverson&#x27;s security guard assaulted him in a 2009 bar fight in Detroit. The federal judge dismissed the case, finding no evidence that Iverson or his bodyguard struck the plaintiff, Guy Walker.

In 2013, Iverson was accused of kidnapping his children and refusing to return them to their mother. He denied the claim and his ex-wife later recanted.

===Marriage and family===
Iverson started dating his high school sweetheart Tawanna Turner when they were 16, and married her at The Mansion on Main Street in Voorhees, New Jersey. They have five children: Tiaura, Allen II, Isaiah, Messiah, and Dream.

On March 2, 2010, Tawanna Iverson filed for divorce, seeking custody of their children, child support, and alimony payments. According to Iverson, the couple were back together less than a month after the divorce was finalized in 2013.

Iverson&#x27;s cousin, Kuran Iverson, is also a basketball player.

==Legacy==
Several media outlets credit Iverson with transforming the culture of the NBA and American sports culture as a whole with his mainstream introduction of the cornrow hairstyle, the marriage of rap music with basketball, and being among the first in promoting non-ceremonial tattoos in popular culture. In 2024, 76ers unveiled a statue of Iverson outside their practice facility. Recognizing Iverson&#x27;s investments in his hometown, the city of Newport News named a street &quot;Allen Iverson Way&quot; and governor of Virginia Glenn Youngkin declared March 5 to be Allen Iverson Day.

On August 14, 2015, American singer Post Malone released the song &quot;White Iverson&quot; mentioning Iverson himself in the title and lyrics of the song. The song debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 14, and would hit over a billion streams on Spotify and a billion views on YouTube. Allen himself responded to the song when it received a billion streams on Spotify: &quot;Congrats on 1 billion Spotify streams. The whole world loves this song and I&#x27;m honored to be a part of it. Keep that same form, Post.&quot;

<text>Alberto Olmedo (24 August 1933 – 5 March 1988) was an Argentine comedian and actor, popularly regarded as one of the most important comedians in the history of his country, for his outstanding work in television, cinema and theater.

Olmedo was born in the city of Rosario. In his teens, he was a gifted gymnast and an aspiring actor who tried his luck with several amateur theater companies and enjoyed some local success.

Olmedo moved to Buenos Aires in 1954. One year later, while working as a technician in Canal 7, Argentina&#x27;s first television station, his improvisation skills caught the attention of the management, whom gave him acting jobs in several TV shows.

While Olmedo had a string of successful children&#x27;s programs during the 1960s, he gained the most notoriety when allowed to mix slapstick, nonsense and adult-oriented entertainment.

== Career ==

=== Film ===
Starting with &quot;Gringalet&quot; in 1959, Olmedo starred in 49 movies, including: &quot;Los Doctores las Prefieren Desnudas&quot; (&quot;Doctors Prefer Them Naked&quot;), in 1973, &quot;Maridos en Vacaciones&quot;, (&quot;Husbands on Vacation&quot;, 1975), &quot;Fotógrafo de Señoras&quot; (&quot;Ladies&#x27; Photographer&quot;, 1978), &quot;Las Mujeres Son Cosas de Guapos&quot; (&quot;Women Are for the Brave&quot;, 1981), &quot;Los Fierecillos Indomables&quot; (&quot;The Indomitable Little Beasts&quot;, 1982), &quot;Sálvese Quien Pueda&quot; (&quot;Every Man for Himself&quot;, 1984) and &quot;Rambito y Rambón, Primera Misión&quot; (&quot;Little Rambo and Big Rambo, First Mission&quot;, 1986). His last movie was &quot;Atracción Peculiar&quot;, released shortly after his death. &quot;Los Fierecillos Indomables&quot; had a sequel in 1983.

Many of Olmedo&#x27;s movies in the 1980s were adult-oriented comedies featuring Jorge Porcel and &quot;vedettes&quot; Moria Casán and Susana Giménez. Conservative Argentine authorities rated these movies as PM-18 (age 18 and above), save for a few tamer films aimed at family audiences.

The &quot;Olmedo and Porcel&quot; movies are considered to be the pinnacle of Argentina&#x27;s sexploitation movie genre. Most of these movies were directed by Gerardo Sofovich or his brother Hugo, who also directed Olmedo&#x27;s TV shows &quot;El Chupete&quot; (&quot;The Pacifier&quot;) and &quot;No Toca Botón!&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Touch That Button!&quot;).

=== Television ===
Olmedo&#x27;s &quot;Capitán Piluso&quot; show was a hit with children in the 1960s, but he preferred working for adult audiences. After acting in the successful &quot;Operación Ja Ja&quot; weekly show, Olmedo landed his first leading role in &quot;El Chupete&quot;.

In 1976, shortly after the beginning of the military dictatorship known as the National Reorganization Process, Olmedo had his own death announced on the show. Once the truth was revealed, the actor was punished for his prank and banished from the airwaves for two years.

In the 1980s, &quot;No Toca Botón!&quot; was the highest-rated show in Argentina. In fits of improvisation, Olmedo would stray from script, tear down props, dash past the cameras and verbally abuse his fellow actors. He created popular characters such as &quot;General González&quot;, &quot;Rucucu&quot; the Ukrainian magician, the dictator of Costa Pobre (a parody of a banana republic ruler; its name is a pun on Costa Rica, since the country&#x27;s name means &quot;rich coast&quot; and Costa Pobre means &quot;poor coast&quot;), and above all &quot;el Manosanta&quot; (&quot;the miracle healer&quot;), a multi-level parody on charlatans of all stripes and Argentines&#x27; reckless pursuit of sex and money.

Those years saw the blooming of a partnership with character actor Javier Portales, who provided a counterweight to Olmedo&#x27;s wild improvising.

Olmedo, who was nicknamed &quot;el Negro&quot;, would evoke his Rosario background by using Rosario slang and narrating implausible stories about his childhood exploits.

== Death ==

Olmedo died in the resort city of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires, on 5 March 1988. According to police reports, he slipped off his eleventh-floor apartment&#x27;s balcony. It is believed that he tried, possibly under the influence of alcohol or cocaine, to perform a high-wire stunt on the balcony and lost his balance. The only witness to his last moments was girlfriend Nancy Herrera, who was pregnant with his posthumous son Alberto Jr.

Olmedo married and divorced twice and had six children (including Alberto Jr.). He is buried in La Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

<text>The following lists events that happened during [[1911]] in [[Afghanistan]].

==Incumbents==
* Monarch – Habibullah Khan

==1911-1918==
An Afghan nationalist, Mahmud Tarzi, publishes the periodical &quot;Seraj ol-Akbar&quot; (&quot;Torch of the News&quot;). It is the country&#x27;s first medium for the intellectual exchange of ideas, and its political influence extends beyond the boundaries of Afghanistan.

==1911==
Again Afghanistan is &quot;happy in having no history&quot;. The &quot;amir&quot; is loyal in carrying out the agreement for the removal of outlaws to beyond fifty miles of the Indian frontier, but this has not wholly stopped the raids. In Afghanistan itself the road between Kabul and Jalalabad is for a considerable time unsafe for traders, but matters improve towards the end of the year. The &quot;amir&quot; directs much attention to the improvement of the main roads throughout the country, more especially in the direction of Jalalabad and Kandahar.

<doc id="305481" wikidata="Q241498" url="?curid=305481" title="Geraldine Farrar">
<text>Alice Geraldine Farrar (February 28, 1882 – March 11, 1967) was an American lyric soprano who could also sing dramatic roles. She was noted for her beauty, acting ability, and &quot;the intimate timbre of her voice.&quot; In the 1910s, she also found success as an actress in silent films. She had a large following among young women, who were nicknamed &quot;Gerry-flappers&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Farrar was born in Melrose, Massachusetts, the daughter of baseball player Sidney Farrar, and his wife Henrietta Barnes. At age five, she began studying music in Boston and by 14 was giving recitals. Later she studied voice with the American soprano Emma Thursby in New York City, in Paris, and finally with the Italian baritone Francesco Graziani in Berlin. Farrar created a sensation at the Berlin Hofoper with her debut as Marguerite in Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; in 1901 and remained with the company for three years, during which time she continued her studies with famed German soprano Lilli Lehmann. (She had been recommended to Lehmann by another famous soprano of the previous generation, Lillian Nordica.) She appeared in the title roles of Ambroise Thomas&#x27; &quot;Mignon&quot; and Jules Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;, as well as Juliette in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;. Her admirers in Berlin included Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany, with whom she is believed to have had a relationship beginning in 1903.

==Career in Grand opera==

After three years with the Monte Carlo Opera, Farrar made her debut at the New York Metropolitan Opera in &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; on November 26, 1906. She appeared in the first Met performance of Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; in 1907 and remained a member of the company until her retirement in 1922, singing 29 roles there in 672 performances. She developed a great popular following, especially among New York&#x27;s young female opera-goers, who were known as &quot;Gerry-flappers&quot;. Farrar created the title roles in Pietro Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Amica&quot; (Monte Carlo, 1905), Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Suor Angelica&quot; (New York City, 1918), Umberto Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Madame Sans-Gêne&quot; (New York, 1915), as well as the Goosegirl in Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Königskinder&quot; (New York, 1910), for which Farrar trained her own flock of geese. According to a review in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; of the first performance, &quot;at the close of the opera Miss Farrar caused &#x27;much amusement&#x27; by appearing before the curtain with a live goose under her arm.&quot;

According to her biographer:

She recorded extensively for the Victor Talking Machine Company and was often featured prominently in that firm&#x27;s advertisements. 

==Film career==
Farrar also appeared in silent films, which were produced between opera seasons. Literary and film critic Edward Wagenknecht describes Geraldine Farrar as “the most illustrious artist Paramount brought to the screen.” The acquisition of Farrar by producer Jesse Lasky in 1915 was regarded as “the most sensational coup in motion-picture history” at the time. As a prima donna of the Metropolitan Opera, Farrar’s arrival in Hollywood was greeted with great anticipation and fanfare:

She starred in more than a dozen films from 1915 to 1920, including Cecil B. De Mille&#x27;s 1915 adaptation of Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen.&quot;&quot; The film’s premiere at Symphony Hall in Boston was preceded by a fulsome publicity campaign and garnered effusive reviews by critics. San Francisco Call &amp; Post wrote: 

For her performance, she came in first among the women in the 1916 &quot;Screen Masterpiece&quot; contest held by &quot;Motion Picture Magazine&quot;. One of her other notable screen roles —and the one that Farrar personally ranked her finest—was as Joan of Arc in the 1917 film Joan the Woman.

In June 1931, Farrar made her debut radio broadcast over the National Broadcasting Company&#x27;s nationwide &quot;Red&quot; network.

In 1960, Farrar was awarded two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in the music and film categories, located at 1620 and 1709 Vine Street.

==Personal life==
Beginning in 1908, Farrar had a seven-year love affair with the Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini. Her ultimatum, that he leave his wife and children and marry her, resulted in Toscanini&#x27;s abrupt resignation as principal conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in 1915. Farrar was a close friend to the Met&#x27;s star tenor Enrico Caruso and there has been speculation that they too had a love affair. It is said that Caruso coined her motto: &quot;Farrar farà&quot; (&quot;Farrar will do it&quot;).

Her marriage to actor Lou Tellegen on February 8, 1916, was the source of considerable scandal. The marriage ended, as a result of her husband&#x27;s numerous affairs, in a very public divorce in 1923. The circumstances of the divorce were brought again to public recollection by Tellegen&#x27;s bizarre 1934 suicide in Hollywood. Farrar reportedly said &quot;Why should that interest me?&quot; when told of Tellegen&#x27;s death.

Farrar retired from opera in 1922 at the age of 40. Her final performance was as Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Zazà&quot;. By this stage, her voice was in premature decline due to overwork. According to the American music critic Henry Pleasants, the author of &quot;The Great Singers from the Dawn of Opera to Our Own Time&quot; (first published 1967), she gave between 25 and 35 performances each season at the Met alone. They included 95 appearances as Madama Butterfly and 58 as Carmen in 16 seasons. The title role in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, which she had added to her repertoire in 1909, was another one of her favourite Met parts.

Farrar quickly transitioned into concert recitals, and was signed (within several weeks of announcing her opera retirement) to an appearance at Hershey Park on Memorial Day 1922. She continued to make recordings and give recitals throughout the 1920s and was briefly the intermission commentator for the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts during the 1934–35 season. Her unusual autobiography, &quot;Such Sweet Compulsion&quot;, published in 1938, was written in alternating chapters purporting to be her own words and those of her deceased mother, with Mrs. Farrar rather floridly recounting her daughter&#x27;s many accomplishments.

In 1967, Farrar died in Ridgefield, Connecticut of heart disease aged 85, and was buried in Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. She had no children.

<text>The Archdiocese of St. Louis () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory, or archdiocese, of the Catholic Church in the eastern part of the U.S. state of Missouri.

As of November 2024, the archdiocese is led by Archbishop Mitchell Thomas Rozanski, formerly the Bishop of Springfield in Massachusetts. The archdiocesan cathedral is the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis in St. Louis.

== Structure ==
The Archdiocese of St. Louis covers the City of St. Louis and the Missouri counties of Franklin, Jefferson, Lincoln, Perry, Saint Charles, Saint Francois, Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, Warren, and Washington. It is the metropolitan see of the ecclesiastical province containing three suffragan sees:

* Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau in southern Missouri
* Diocese of Jefferson City in northeastern Missouri
* Diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph in western Missouri

==History==

=== 1600 to 1800 ===
The first Catholic presence in present-day Missouri was that of the Jesuit missionary Reverend Jacques Marquette in 1673, who stopped in Perry County while voyaging down the Mississippi River. In 1759, French-Canadian settlers established St. Genevieve, the first parish in the archdiocese, in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri. During this period, the Catholics in the region were under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of San Cristobal de la Habana, based in Havana, Cuba. With the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, Spain took control of the French territories west of the Mississippi River.

In 1793, after the American Revolution, Pope Pius VI erected the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas, based in New Orleans. It encompassed all the Spanish territories on the continent, including the Missouri area. Due to politics in Europe, the new diocese did not receive a bishop until 1815.

=== 1800 to 1826 ===
In 1803, with the signing of the Louisiana Purchase, the United States took control from France of a vast area of the continent, including Missouri. Pope Pius VII in 1815 named Reverend Louis Dubourg from the Diocese of Baltimore as the first bishop of Louisiana and the Two Floridas. Due to concerns about his personal safety in New Orleans, Dubourg chose the City of St. Louis as his episcopal see. He founded St.Louis Parish, the first parish in the city.

Wanting to train American priests for his vast diocese, DuBourg established St. Mary&#x27;s of the Barrens Seminary in Perryville in 1818, placing it under the charge of the Lazarist fathers. In August 1818, he recruited Sister Rose Philippine Duchesne from the Society of the Sacred Heart in France, to open girls schools in the diocese. Duchesne founded the Academy of the Sacred Heart in St. Charles, the first free school west of the Mississippi River, along with another girls school in Florissant. DuBourg also invited the Sisters of Loretto to establish a school for girls. In 1818, DuBourg founded the Saint Louis Academy, later known as Saint Louis College, to educate Catholic laymen. In 1823, at DuBourg&#x27;s invitation, the Society of Jesus sent several Belgian priests to Florissant, where they began ministering to Native American converts.

In 1824, Pope Leo XII appointed Bishop Joseph Rosati as coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas. After Rosati&#x27;s appointment, Dubourg moved his episcopal see back to New Orleans, leaving Rosati in control of St. Louis.

=== 1826 to 1847 ===

On July 18, 1826, Pope Leo XII divided the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas. One of the new dioceses was the Diocese of St. Louis, which included Missouri along with vast areas of the American Midwest and Great Plains. Because of its size, the diocese was often referred to as the Rome of the West. Leo XII named Rosati as the first bishop of St. Louis.

In 1827, Rosati transferred Saint Louis College to the Jesuits. They converted the lower division of the college into St. Louis University High School. The Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul opened Mullanphy Hospital in St. Louis in 1828. The Jesuits established Saint Louis College as Saint Louis University in 1829. Rosati dedicated the Cathedral of St. Louis in 1834, making it the first Catholic cathedral west of the Mississippi River.

As Catholic communities started increasing outside of St. Louis, the Vatican erected new dioceses from the Diocese of St. Louis. In 1837, Pope Gregory XVI erected the Diocese of Dubuque, covering the present-day states of Iowa, Minnesota, and the Dakotas. The same pope appointed Reverend Peter Kenrick as coadjutor bishop in St. Louis to assist Rosati in 1841. When Kenrick became coadjutor bishop, the diocese was heavily in debt due to the $90,000 cost of the new cathedral. With Rosati&#x27;s assistance, the diocese received financial aid from Catholic organizations in Europe. Kenrick&#x27;s brother Francis Kenrick, bishop of the Diocese of Philadelphia, also provided the diocese with assistance.

In early 1843, the Vatican took more territory from St. Louis to found the Diocese of Little Rock in Arkansas and the Diocese of Chicago in Illinois. After Rosati died in Rome in late 1843, Kenrick automatically succeeded him as bishop of St. Louis.

After receiving a $300,000 bequest, Kenrick was able to stabilize the diocesan finances through some shrewd real estate dealings. He took many trips by horseback throughout the diocese, reaching Catholics who did not have priests serving their communities. In St. Louis, Kenrick instructed the cathedral priests to celebrate masses in English instead of French, as most of the congregation was now English-speaking.

=== 1847 to 1900 ===

Pope Pius IX elevated the Diocese of St. Louis to the Archdiocese of St. Louis on July 20, 1847, naming Kenrick as its first archbishop. By 1850, the archdiocese was operating ten parishes in the City of St. Louis.

During the American Civil War, Kenrick maintained a neutral position in a strongly divided Missouri. After the war, he urged his priests to refuse to take the ironclad oath to the United States Government. The oath was a tactic promoted by Republicans to block former officials of the Confederacy from holding influential positions in society. Reverend John A. Cummings challenged the legality of the oath in a case that reached the United States Supreme Court. It later ruled that the government could not force individuals to take the oath.

In May 1893, Pope Leo XIII appointed Bishop John Kain from the Diocese of Wheeling as coadjutor archbishop to assist Kenrick. When Kenrick died in June 1895, Kain automatically succeeded him as archbishop. During his tenure as archbishop, Kain purchased property in St. Louis for a new cathedral. However, a tornado in the archdiocese depleted its funds, delaying the start of its construction.

=== 1900 to 1950 ===
Pope Pius X named Coadjutor Bishop John J. Glennon from the Diocese of Kansas City to serve as coadjutor archbishop of St. Louis in 1903 to assist the ailing Kain. When Kain died in October 1903, Glennon automatically succeeded him as archbishop. He opened the new Kenrick Seminary in St. Louis in 1915, followed by the minor seminary in Shrewsbury.

During the early 1940s, many local Jesuit priests challenged the segregationist policies at the St. Louis Catholic schools. In 1943, Glennon blocked a young African-American woman from enrolling at Webster College. When some priests confronted Glennon about this, he called the integration plan a &quot;Jesuit ploy&quot;. He transferred one of the complaining priests from an African-American parish. Saint Louis University began admitting African American students in the summer of 1943 after its president, Reverend Patrick Holloran, gained Glennon&#x27;s approval. Glennon died in 1946.

Pope Pius XII appointed Archbishop Joseph Ritter of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis as the fourth archbishop of St. Louis in 1946. The archdiocese grew quickly during the post-World War II economic boom. Ritter opened an average of three parishes per year in St. Louis city and county. He raised more than $125,000,000 () to build 60 new parishes and 16 high schools.

As one of his first acts as archbishop, Ritter announced that Webster College would now accept African-American students. In 1947, Ritter also allowed the senior class of St. Joseph&#x27;s High School, then the city&#x27;s only African-American Catholic high school, to celebrate graduation for the first time at the cathedral, alongside white students.

On August 9, 1947, Ritter announced an end to racial segregation in the archdiocesan high schools. He declared, &quot;The cross on top of our schools must mean something,&quot; and expressed his belief in &quot;the equality of every soul before Almighty God&quot;. The Catholic Parents Association of Saint Louis and Saint Louis County, a group of white parents, threatened to sue Ritter, stating that his desegregation order violated Missouri state law. Ritter then issued a pastoral letter, warning about possible excommunication for Catholics &quot;interfering with ecclesiastical office authority by having recourse to authority outside of the church&quot;. Ritter later ordered all the parish schools to &quot;accept all children into parish schools without regard to race&quot;. Ritter also desegregated all Catholic hospitals in the archdiocese.

Ritter started fundraising for the Cardinal Glennon Memorial Hospital for Children in St. Louis in 1949. Ritter also developed what is now known as the Annual Catholic Appeal, which remains a primary source of financial support for many archdiocesan educational and charitable activities.

=== 1950 to 1980 ===

In 1950, Ritter created 31 classrooms for special needs students in archdiocesan schools and two group homes. In 1956, he established a mission in La Paz, Bolivia, one of the first foreign missions sponsored by an American diocese. Until that time, religious institutes or societies of apostolic life had run most foreign missions. Parishioners in the archdiocese regularly contributed more money to foreign missions than any other comparable archdiocese. In 1964, following reforms of the Second Vatican Council, Ritter celebrated the world&#x27;s first authorized mass in English at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis. Ritter died in 1967.

On February 14, 1968, Pope Paul VI named Bishop John Carberry of the Diocese of Columbus as the fifth archbishop of St. Louis. In 1969, Carberry removed 60 seminarians from a class at the Saint Louis University Divinity School because a Presbyterian scholar was teaching a segment on Pauls&#x27; epistles.

In 1971, Carberry closed McBride High school in North St. Louis, a largely black area. He was criticized for closing the school while subsidizing a swimming pool at John F. Kennedy High School in Manchester, a wealthy white suburb. Carberry moved his own residence from the episcopal residence in St. Louis to suburban Creve Coeur. In 1972, he established the Urban Services Apostolate for inner-city parishes. Carberry initially opposed the reception of communion by hand, another Second Vatican Council reform. He believed that it was irreverent and risked the possibility of recipients stealing hosts to use at black masses. However, he finally permitted this practice in 1977. That same year, he ordained the first permanent deacons in the archdiocese. Carberry retired in 1979.

=== 1980 to 1990 ===
On January 24, 1980, Bishop; John L. May from the Diocese of Mobile was appointed the sixth archbishop of St. Louis by Pope John Paul II. During his 12-year tenure, May encouraged an active dialogue between Christians of all denominations. He ordained Reverend J. Terry Steib as the first African American auxiliary bishop in the archdiocese. May also appointed the archdiocese&#x27;s first chief financial officer and the first woman to serve as superintendent of Catholic schools. He started a self-insurance program in the archdiocese and improved the retirement program for lay employees.

An advocate for the poor and homeless, May greatly expanded the programs of Catholic Charities, and initiated a program for pregnant women. Due to a decline in the number of seminarians, May was forced to consolidate the archdiocesan seminary system. In 1987, he merged Cardinal Glennon College and Kenrick Seminary to form Kenrick-Glennon Seminary in Shrewsbury.

=== 1990 to 2000 ===

In 1990, with Sister Mary Ann Eckhoff and businessman Robert A. Brooks, May co-founded the Today and Tomorrow Educational Foundation. Due to health reasons, May retired in 1992.

In 1994, John Paul II named Bishop Justin Rigali from the Roman Curia as the seventh archbishop of St. Louis. During his tenure at St. Louis, Rigali visited every Catholic high school in the archdiocese. However, Rigali opposed collective bargaining by teachers and their efforts to unionize. Rigali was widely credited as an able administrator and effective fundraiser, although observers said that his popularity dimmed as his tenure continued.

In January 1999, Rigali hosted the visit of John Paul II to St. Louis. The pope reportedly decided to visit the archdiocese because of his longtime close friendship with Rigali in Rome. According to the &quot;St. Louis Business Journal&quot;, Rigali &quot;brought financial stability to the St. Louis Archdiocese, overseeing successful capital campaigns to address immediate needs and raising endowment funds for the future.&quot;

=== 2000 to 2010 ===

In 2003, Rigali was appointed archbishop of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. To replace him, John Paul II that same year named Bishop Raymond Burke from the Diocese of La Crosse as the next archbishop of St. Louis. Burke invited the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (ICKSP), a traditionalist Catholic order, into the archdiocese. He ordained two ICKSP priests in 2007, marking the first use in 40 years of the Tridentine rite of ordination in the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis.

During his tenure, Burke escalated a long-running dispute over the closing of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church in St. Louis. In 2005, its pastor, Reverend Marek Bozek, led a Christmas Eve mass at the church, despite the archdiocese having closed it. Burke then &quot;declare[d] that the church was in &#x27;schism&#x27;&quot;, and excommunicated Bozek and the church lay board. The church then broke away from the archdiocese and sued it for ownership of its assets. In 2012, a court awarded the assets to St. Stanislaus.

In 2006, when voters approved an amendment to the Missouri State Constitution permitting embryonic stem cell research, Burke said it meant that &quot;our tiniest brothers and sisters ... will be made legally the subjects, the slaves, of those who wish to manipulate and destroy their lives for the sake of supposed scientific and technological progress.&quot; In 2008, the Vatican named Burke as prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura in Rome.

Pope Benedict XVI named Bishop Robert Carlson from the Diocese of Saginaw as the ninth archbishop of St. Louis on April 21, 2009.

=== 2010 to present ===
In 2014, after trying to reconcile with the St. Stanislaus Kostka board and parishioners, Carlson surrendered its property claims to the church. As part of the agreement, the church administration agreed not to claim any affiliation with the Catholic Church.

In response to the 2018 grand jury report concerning clerical sexual abuse in Pennsylvania, Carlson invited the Missouri attorney general&#x27;s office to inspect the archdiocesan files and to produce a report on clerical abuse in Missouri. Carlson retired in 2020.

To replace Carlson, Pope Francis named Bishop Mitchell T. Rozanski from Springfield in Massachusetts as the next archbishop of St. Louis. In 2022, the archdiocese ended its participation in the National School Lunch Program, established in 1946 to provide lunch to poor students, stating that it did not want to comply with regulations under the Civil Rights Act. The archdiocese stated that it would start its own free lunch program.

In May 2023, Rozanski announced All Things New, a plan to reduce the number of parishes in the archdiocese from 178 to 134 with closures and mergers. Seven parishes filed appeals of the closures in August 2023 with the Dicastery for the Clergy in Rome, which decided to accept appeals from two parishes. The Dicastery in June 2024 rejected the two appeals. Rozanski noted;&quot;The church experience in our parishes today is not the same as it was 50 years ago, yet we are still functioning in many ways out of the same mode of evangelization with the same structures. We have inherited a great treasure of Catholic institutions from previous generations, but many of them are no longer as effective or sustainable as they once were.”In June 2024, the archdiocese released its report &quot;Slavery in the Historic Archdiocese of St. Louis&quot;. It identified 70 enslaved people who had been owned by Bishop Dubourg, Bishop Rosati and diocesan clergy prior to the end of the American Civil War.

===Sexual abuse ===
In 2004, the Archdiocese of St. Louis paid $1.7 million to settle sexual abuse claims.

In 2018, Archbishop Carlson testified in court that he was unsure whether he knew in the 1980s that sexual assault of a minor was a crime. He also stated that he did not know when he realized that fact.

In July 2019, the archdiocese released the names of 64 clergy who were credibly accused of committing acts of sexual abuse. On August 16, 2019, the &quot;sexually violent priest&quot; Reverend Frederick Lenczycki, who had served prison time in Illinois between 2004 and 2009 for acts of sexual abuse, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to sexually abusing a boy in St. Louis County. In 2019, the Missouri Attorney General identified over 160 instances of archdiocesan priests and deacons sexually abusing minors.

In June 2023, the archdiocese agreed to pay $1 million to settle a lawsuit by a man who alleged he was raped when an altar boy from fourth through sixth grade by a since-defrocked priest who has been required to register as a sex offender.

In July 2024, 25 former attendees of archdiocesan churches and schools sued the archdiocese, stating that its leadership knew about rampant incidents of sexual abuse. One former altar boy says he was sexually abused between 2008 and 2011 by Reverend William Vatterott, who was later convicted of possession of child pornography. Another plaintiff says he was caught wearing red socks, which were prohibited at Catholic summer camp, and was sent to a priest for discipline. The priest abused the child, then told him he would &quot;burn in hell for all eternity&quot; unless he kept the abuse secret. A woman said that in 1999, when she was age nine, she was abused by Reverend James Grady and a nun called &quot;Sister Annette&quot;.

=== Cathedral of Saint Louis ===
The Cathedral of Saint Louis was dedicated to King Louis IX of France. Its co-patrons are Reverend Vincent de Paul and Sister Rose Philippine Duchesne. The cathedral contains the largest collection of mosaics in the world. It was dedicated in 1926 on the 100th anniversary of the establishment of St. Louis as a diocese, and was started by Archbishop Glennon and completed by Archbishop May. Work on the cathedral mosaics would not be completed for 60 years. The Vatican designated the Cathedral of St. Louis as a basilica in 1997 on the 150th anniversary of the archdiocese.

<text>Michael Francis Foley (born June 7, 1965) is an American retired professional wrestler and author. He is signed to WWE, under a Legends contract while also serving as an ambassador.

Foley worked for many wrestling promotions, including the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), as well as numerous promotions in Japan. He is widely regarded as one of the biggest stars of the Attitude Era and one of the greatest wrestlers in the history of professional wrestling, and headlined the 2000 edition of WWE&#x27;s premier annual event, WrestleMania. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2013.

Foley has wrestled under his real name and various personas. His main persona during his time in WCW and ECW from 1991 to 1996 was Cactus Jack, a dastardly, bloodthirsty and uncompromisingly physical brawler from Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, who wore cowboy boots and often used sharp metallic objects, such as barbed wire, thumbtacks, and trashcans. When Foley first appeared in the WWF in 1996, he debuted the persona known as Mankind, an eerie, masochistic, mentally deranged lunatic who was masked and spent his spare time dwelling in mechanical rooms. The following year, Foley debuted Dude Love, a relaxed, fun-loving, jive-talking, tie-dyed shirt-wearing hippie. These personas were known as the &quot;Three Faces of Foley&quot;, with Cactus Jack making his debut in the WWF also in 1997. All three characters appeared in the 1998 Royal Rumble, making Foley the only competitor to enter the same Royal Rumble match three times under different personas.

Foley is a four-time world champion (three WWF Championships and one TNA World Heavyweight Championship), an 11-time world tag team champion (eight WWF Tag Team Championships, two ECW World Tag Team Championships, and one WCW World Tag Team Championship), a one-time TNA Legends Champion, and the inaugural WWF Hardcore Champion. Foley&#x27;s Hell in a Cell match against The Undertaker is regarded as one of his most memorable and controversial matches and widely acknowledged as the greatest Hell in a Cell Match of all time. Foley&#x27;s dedicated and physical style of wrestling led him to often participate in violent and brutal matches that involved him taking dangerous bumps and putting his body through a considerable physical toll, eventually earning him the moniker &quot;The Hardcore Legend&quot;.

== Early life ==
Michael Francis Foley was born in Bloomington, Indiana, on June 7, 1965. He is of Irish descent, and has an older brother named John. Shortly after his birth, he moved with his family to the Long Island town of East Setauket, about 40 miles east of New York City, where he attended Ward Melville High School. At school, he wrestled and played lacrosse, and was a classmate and wrestling teammate of actor Kevin James. In October 1983, while a student at the State University of New York at Cortland, Foley hitchhiked to Madison Square Garden to see his favorite wrestler, &quot;Superfly&quot; Jimmy Snuka, in a steel cage match against Don Muraco. He has said that Snuka&#x27;s flying body splash from the top of the cage inspired him to pursue a career in professional wrestling. He had a seat close to the front row and is visible in the video of the event.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1986–1989) ===

Foley formally trained at Dominic DeNucci&#x27;s wrestling school in Freedom, Pennsylvania, driving several hours weekly from his college campus in Cortland, New York. He debuted on June 23, 1986, in Clarksburg, West Virginia, under the ring name &quot;Cactus Jack&quot;. In addition to appearing on DeNucci&#x27;s cards, Foley and several other students also took part in some squash matches as jobbers for World Wrestling Federation TV tapings of &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;, &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot; and &quot;Superstars of Wrestling&quot;, where Foley wrestled under the ring names &quot;Jack Foley&quot; and &quot;Nick Foley.&quot; Notably, a ring announcer once mispronounced Foley&#x27;s last name as &quot;Faley&quot; before a match against Kamala on a 1987 episode of WWF Wrestling Challenge. In another match (the second episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;), Foley and Les Thornton faced the British Bulldogs, during which the Dynamite Kid (who had a long earned reputation as a stiff worker in the ring) clotheslined Foley with such force that he was unable to eat solid food for several weeks. During these squash matches, Foley also faced other top-level talents at the time, such as Hercules Hernandez. His run would not last long, as he had not signed a contract with the promotion at the time. During this run, he was also billed from different hometowns and at different weights.

After two years of relative obscurity on the independent circuit, Foley began receiving offers from various regional promotions, including Bill Watts&#x27; Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). In 1988, he joined the Memphis, Tennessee–based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), where he teamed with Gary Young as part of the Stud Stable. Cactus and Young briefly held the CWA Tag Team Championship in late 1988. In November 1988, Foley left the CWA for the Texas-based World Class Wrestling Association (WCWA). In the WCWA, &quot;Cactus Jack&quot;, billed as &quot;Cactus Jack Manson&quot;, was a major part of Skandor Akbar&#x27;s stable (the addition of &quot;Manson&quot; to Foley&#x27;s name, due to its implied connection to Charles Manson, made him uncomfortable). Foley also won several titles, including the WCWA World Light Heavyweight Championship and WCWA World Tag Team Championship. He left the company in August 1989 after losing a loser leaves town match to Eric Embry in nine seconds. He then briefly competed in Alabama&#x27;s Continental Wrestling Federation.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1989–1990) ===
In November 1989, Foley began wrestling for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as &quot;Cactus Jack&quot;. His debut match, which aired on &quot;NWA World Championship Wrestling&quot;, saw him partnered with a one-time jobber named Rick Fargo to face the rising tag team of brothers Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner – two of the stiffest and toughest workers in wrestling at the time. After taking brutal bumps from both Steiner brothers and losing the match, Cactus then began fighting with Fargo, and then jumped nearly off the apron to elbow Fargo in the abdomen, per Kevin Sullivan&#x27;s instructions. Lead WCW booker Ric Flair, Sullivan, and other WCW executives were impressed with this to the point that they offered Foley a contract, and Foley finally found some financial stability after years of hardship. Over the following months, Cactus Jack would generally team with jobbers. When the jobber would lose the match for the team, Cactus Jack would attack his partner, throw them out of the ring, and deliver his infamous ring apron flying elbow drop onto the concrete floor.

Foley&#x27;s biggest match to date came in February 1990 against Mil Máscaras at &quot;Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout&quot;, where he took a particularly brutal bump backward off the high apron and landed on the concrete floor, with his head and back taking the impact. Later that month, he formed the villainous &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Slaughterhouse&quot; stable with Kevin Sullivan and Bam Bam Bigelow and began a long feud with Norman the Lunatic. At the Capital Combat pay-per-view in May 1990, the Slaughterhouse lost to Norman the Lunatic and the Road Warriors in a six-man tag team match. It was during this period that Foley was involved in a car accident that resulted in the loss of his two front teeth, adding to the distinctive look for which he is famous. Foley left WCW in June 1990 after a conversation with booker Ole Anderson in which Anderson critiqued his style.

=== Various Promotions; All Japan Pro Wrestling (1990–1991) ===
After leaving WCW in June 1990, Foley briefly returned to the United States Wrestling Association in Dallas, where he wrestled both as &quot;Cactus Jack&quot; and under a mask as &quot;Zodiac #2&quot;. In July 1990, he wrestled for Tommy Dee at the Riverhead Raceway in Riverhead, New York, where he met his future wife Colette Christie. In September 1990, he began appearing with the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania–based Tri-State Wrestling Alliance (TWA), the precursor to Eastern Championship Wrestling, whose high-impact and violent wrestling style fit Foley well. In the same month he began wrestling for Herb Abrams&#x27; Reseda, California–based Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF), appearing on its &quot;UWF Fury Hour&quot; program. Foley wrestled for both the TWA and the UWF until March 1991.

In March 1991, Foley (as Cactus Jack) made his first excursion to Japan, wrestling for Giant Baba&#x27;s All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) promotion as part of its Champion Carnival round-robin tournament. He scored zero points in the tournament, losing to Jumbo Tsuruta, Danny Spivey, Johnny Smith, Toshiaki Kawada, Akira Taue, and Danny Kroffat. In addition to competing in the tournament, Foley and Texas Terminator Hoss wrestled several tag team matches, facing opponents including André the Giant, Dory Funk Jr., Terry Funk, and Johnny Ace. During one bout, Foley accidentally broke the elbow of Ace – the favorite wrestler of Giant Baba&#x27;s wife – which Foley attributes to his not being invited back to AJPW, coupled with Baba&#x27;s reservations about Foley&#x27;s dress sense and wrestling style (which had drawn unwelcome comparisons to Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, regarded by Baba as garbage wrestling).

Returning to the United States in April 1991, Foley resumed wrestling for TWA and the UWF. In May 1991 at the TWA&#x27;s &quot;Spring Spectacular II&quot; event, Foley faced Eddie Gilbert in a barbed wire match – a sight not often seen in professional wrestling in the United States, and an object Foley would often be associated with. Barbed wire would be wrapped with the ropes all around the ring, and Cactus and Gilbert both bled heavily; the match ended when Gilbert threw Cactus into the ring ropes and he did a hangman — a planned move where a wrestler&#x27;s head is tangled between the top two ring ropes – only this time his head was tangled with the ring ropes and barbed wire. The following month, at UWF&#x27;s Beach Brawl pay-per-view, Foley teamed with Bob Orton in a loss to Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild (Steve Ray and Sunny Beach).

In July and August 1991, Foley appeared with the Dallas-based Global Wrestling Federation, where he formed a short-lived tag team with Makhan Singh known as &quot;Cartel&quot;. Cartel took part in a tournament for the newly created GWF Tag Team Championship, losing to Chris Walker and Steve Simpson in the semi-finals. Foley also competed in a tournament for the GWF North American Heavyweight Championship, losing to Terry Gordy in the quarter-finals.

In August 1991 at TWA&#x27;s Summer Sizzler event, Cactus Jack and Eddie Gilbert had three matches in one night: Cactus won a falls count anywhere match, lost a stretcher match, and then fought to a double disqualification in a cage match. These matches caught the attention of World Championship Wrestling promoters, in large part due to widespread photo circulation, and in August 1991, Foley re-joined WCW.

=== Return to World Championship Wrestling (1991–1994) ===

==== Early years (1991–1993) ====
Foley returned to WCW in August 1991 as &quot;Cactus Jack&quot;, wrestling on house shows. On September 5, 1991, at Clash of the Champions XVI: Fall Brawl, Cactus Jack burst out of a giant box and attacked Sting, the then-WCW World Heavyweight Champion. After feuds with Van Hammer and Abdullah the Butcher, Cactus Jack faced Sting in a non-title falls count anywhere match at Beach Blast in 1992, which Sting won. For a long time, Foley considered this the best match he ever worked. Unlike Jack&#x27;s first stint in WCW, where his personality was quieter, he was now outwardly maniacal; laughing hysterically, shrieking into the air while choking his opponents and yelling his signature catchphrase &quot;Bang-Bang!&quot;.

At Clash of the Champions XX in September 1992, Cactus Jack unsuccessfully challenged Ron Simmons for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.

After spending a year and a half with WCW as a heel, Cactus Jack transitioned into a fan favorite after engaging in a feud with Paul Orndorff, Harley Race, and Big Van Vader. Jack and Orndorff wrestled each other in a match for a spot on WCW World Heavyweight Champion Vader&#x27;s team at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXII&quot;. After the match, Race and Orndorff beat up Jack. At the following Clash of Champions event, Cactus Jack helped Sting&#x27;s team win the match. He engaged in a feud with Orndorff, winning a falls-count-anywhere match against Orndorff at SuperBrawl III. He then moved on to face Big Van Vader.

==== Feud with Big Van Vader (1993–1994) ====
Cactus Jack wrestled Big Van Vader on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out after being severely beaten. Although talented and athletic, the 400 lb (180 kg) Vader was a notoriously stiff wrestler who had been trained in the Japanese &quot;strong&quot; style, and he hit so hard that most other wrestlers outright refused to work with him, out of fear of severe injury. However, Foley decided to continue his program with Vader, and as a result of Cactus&#x27;s victory, in a rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Harley Race removed the protective mats at ringside and Vader powerbombed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot. While Foley was away, WCW ran an angle where Cactus Jack&#x27;s absence was explained with a farcical comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, then escaped, and then developed amnesia. Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy vignettes that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; that they were the brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved. The angle was awarded &quot;Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic&quot; by the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;.

In one of WCW&#x27;s most violent and brutal matches of all time, Cactus Jack faced Vader in a Texas Deathmatch (a variation of a Last Man Standing match) at Halloween Havoc 1993 in New Orleans on October 24 after having a wheel being spun and the wheel stopping at this match choice. After 15 minutes of brawling and brutal spots which left both Cactus and Vader covered in blood, Race won the match for Vader by using a stun gun on Cactus, knocking him out. The level of violence and brutality involved in this match left the crowd and commentators Tony Schiavone and Jesse Ventura in stunned disbelief; both did not commentate much throughout the second half of the match. It also caused WCW, a promotion marketing itself as family friendly to refuse to book Cactus Jack against Vader on a pay-per-view again.

On March 16, 1994, during WCW&#x27;s &quot;Battle Stars 1994&quot; tour of Germany, Cactus and Big Van Vader had one of the most infamous matches in wrestling history as part of WCW&#x27;s European Cup tournament. Cactus began a hangman, but neither wrestler was aware that the ring ropes had been drawn extra tight before the event, and Cactus could barely move. When Cactus finally freed himself from the ropes and fell out of the ring, his ears were badly split at the back. When Cactus re-entered the ring, the two wrestlers began trading blows. During this time, Vader reached up and grabbed Cactus&#x27;s right ear, and ripped it off. The two men continued wrestling as the referee picked up the ear and gave it to the ring announcer. Vader claimed for years after that the ear had come off during the botched Hangman maneuver, however in a WWE Network video, Vader admits that after seeing footage that he had indeed removed Cactus&#x27;s ear.

Cactus Jack and Vader wrestled their final match in WCW – a Texas death match – in April 1994, a year to the day since their first match. During the bout, Vader once again powerbombed Cactus Jack on the floor, mirroring his actions of the prior year. Upon watching the match on &quot;WCW WorldWide&quot;, Foley was disgruntled by the commentary of Tony Schiavone and Bobby Heenan, which failed to reference the events of the prior year. Frustrated by WCW and the company&#x27;s new head Eric Bischoff&#x27;s reluctance to work a storyline with Vader around losing his ear. This frustration turned into a realization for Foley- after being unable to see a positive or lucrative future for himself with Bischoff in charge, Foley decided not to renew his contract with WCW.

==== World Tag Team Champion; departure (1994) ====
At Spring Stampede in April 1994, Cactus Jack and Maxx Payne faced WCW World Tag Team Champions the Nasty Boys in a violently brutal and chaotic tag team Chicago Street Fight, where Cactus Jack lost the match after he was shoved off a high stage and landed back first on the concrete. Later that month, Cactus Jack formed a tag team with Kevin Sullivan, with the duo feuding with the Nasty Boys. Cactus Jack and Sullivan were scheduled to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship at Slamboree in May 1994. Foley had to choose between surgically reconstructing his ear or wrestling at the pay-per-view and winning the titles. Foley opted to wrestle and won his only championship in WCW, defeating the Nasty Boys in a &quot;Broad Street Bully match&quot; with Dave Schultz as the special guest referee.

During Cactus Jack&#x27;s reign as WCW World Tag Team Champion, WCW shared a brief co-promotion with ECW during this time in which Cactus Jack represented WCW on &quot;ECW Hardcore TV&quot; as the WCW Tag Team Champion, culminating in a bout against Sabu at Hostile City Showdown on June 24, 1994. During a promo, Cactus Jack spat on his title belt and threw it to the ground to appeal to the ECW fans who shunned the mainstream promotions, an act for which he was later forced to apologize to booker Ric Flair.

Following successful defenses against the Nasty Boys and Harlem Heat, Cactus Jack and Sullivan lost the WCW World Tag Team Championship to Pretty Wonderful at Bash at the Beach in July 1994. After turning on Sullivan, Foley wrestled his final match for the company at Fall Brawl &#x27;94: War Games in September 1994, losing to Sullivan in a &quot;loser leaves WCW&quot; match.

=== Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1994) ===
In October 1994, Foley joined Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) as Cactus Jack, causing Boo Bradley to lose the SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship. He often teamed with Brian Lee to feud with Bradley and Chris Candido. Cactus then began a crusade to rid Bradley of his valet Tamara Fytch. He ignited a feud between Candido and Bradley when he accused Candido of having sexual relations with Fytch. Cactus Jack left SMW in December 1994 before the feud was resolved.

=== Eastern Championship Wrestling / Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994–1996) ===
Cactus Jack&#x27;s first appearance for the NWA-affiliated Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion came on the May 31, 1994, episode, with Cactus revealed as Sabu&#x27;s opponent for the Hostile City Showdown event on June 24 at the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After being part of a talent exchange between ECW and WCW, Foley brought his WCW World Tag Team Championship belt and spit on it for a recorded ECW TV segment. Foley continued with ECW and began a feud with Sabu. Foley then began working the ECW tag team division on teams with Terry Funk, Mikey Whipwreck, and Kevin Sullivan. Cactus had two ECW World Tag Team Championship reigns with Whipwreck while in ECW, while at the same time he was training the young Whipwreck.

After a stint in Smoky Mountain Wrestling, Foley returned to ECW to feud with The Sandman. Funk returned to team up with Sandman, and during a particularly violent spot, the pair hit Cactus Jack with a kendo stick forty-six times in a barbed wire rope match. Cactus then defeated Funk at Hostile City Showdown 1995. Later, he repeatedly fought Sandman for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. During their match at Barbed Wire, Hoodies &amp; Chokeslams, Cactus knocked Sandman unconscious and was declared the winner. Referee Bill Alfonso, however, reversed his decision because the title cannot change hands by knockout. Foley then continued to have a series of violent encounters with the Sandman while challenging him and claiming that he had never been beaten in a Falls Count Anywhere match. He then started to team with Tommy Dreamer. According to Heyman, the hardcore style differentiated Foley from other traditional wrestlers, so in ECW, Foley was right at home. However, Foley did not enjoy working with Sandman, as Sandman was often intoxicated during matches and could not perform properly; drinking large amounts of beer and smoking cigarettes made up a large part of Sandman&#x27;s overall gimmick.

But 1995 proved to be an interesting year for Foley, particularly during his time in ECW. Two incidents caused him to change his opinion of a promotion that most thought made him feel like he was at home. There was a sign in the front of the audience one night that said &quot;Cane Dewey&quot; (this was done with Foley&#x27;s permission, when he didn&#x27;t know what this meant, but later understood), a reference to using a Singapore cane on Foley&#x27;s real-life eldest son, who was three years old then (Foley would sometimes mention his family in his promos), and then witnessing a botch in the opening match of Wrestlepalooza on August 5, 1995, where J. T. Smith did a dive, slipped off the ring apron and landed head-first on the concrete. Smith was so severely concussed that his head began swelling on the spot, and the audience&#x27;s response to Smith&#x27;s botch was &quot;you fucked up&quot;. These incidents angered the normally jovial Foley so much that he furiously cut several memorable and scathing promos during this period to channel his intense frustration and anger toward ECW fans, who he felt asked too much from him and the ECW roster. Foley then began a gimmick where he criticized hardcore wrestling and sought to renounce his status as a hardcore wrestling icon and used a slow and technical wrestling style as a way to punish the audience. He said that he was on a mission to save his partner from making the mistake of trying to please bloodthirsty fans. Foley later admitted in an interview in 2015 that after Wrestlepalooza he became indifferent toward ECW and its fanbase.

The mismatched partnership between Cactus Jack and Dreamer lasted until Wrestlepalooza, when Cactus turned on Dreamer while they were teaming with the Pitbulls against Raven, Stevie Richards and the Dudley Brothers (Dudley Dudley and Big Dick Dudley). Cactus DDT&#x27;ed his partner and joined Raven&#x27;s Nest, as he wished to serve Raven&#x27;s &quot;higher purpose&quot;. He remained one of Raven&#x27;s top henchmen for the remainder of his time in ECW. On August 28, Cactus beat the previously undefeated 911. As part of Foley&#x27;s heel gimmick, he began praising WWF and WCW on ECW television, which angered ECW fans. Their anger intensified once word began to spread that Foley was leaving to join the WWF (In &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;, Foley recounted an incident where he asked an ECW roadie to sell T-shirts for him at an event held in a Queens, New York venue where he had been popular even as a heel; the man came back after being spat upon numerous times by angry fans, who made him fear for his life). Even when he tried to give sincere good-byes to the fans, Foley was met with chants of &quot;You sold out&quot; by the ECW fanbase everywhere he went. In February 1996 at CyberSlam, Cactus Jack was booked to face WWF hater Shane Douglas, who won after he handcuffed Cactus and then hit him with no fewer than ten consecutive chair shots, and when he put Jack into a figure four leglock, this allowed Mikey Whipwreck to get into the arena and land one last hard chair shot to Cactus&#x27;s face, knocking him unconscious.

Foley&#x27;s last ECW match was against Whipwreck on March 9, 1996, at Big Ass Extreme Bash, and he recounts that he was not looking forward to it due to the increasingly hostile reactions he got even when he wasn&#x27;t in character. The ECW fans, who knew that this was Foley&#x27;s last match, finally returned his affection. They cheered him throughout the match and chanted, &quot;Please don&#x27;t go!&quot;. After the match, Foley told the audience that their reaction made everything worthwhile and made his exit by dancing with Stevie Richards and The Blue Meanie to Frank Sinatra&#x27;s song &quot;New York, New York&quot;. Foley has said that this exit was his favorite moment in wrestling.

=== International Wrestling Association of Japan (1995–1996) ===

In 1995, during his time in ECW and other promotions in the United States, Foley also went to Japan and wrestled in International Wrestling Association of Japan (IWA Japan), where he engaged in feuds with Terry Funk and Shoji Nakamaki. During his brief stint in Japan, Foley had the nickname &quot;Tsunami Stopper.&quot; The level of violence and brutality in hardcore wrestling matches in Japan was at a much higher level than in Western promotions (except for ECW), something Western wrestlers were not accustomed to. On January 6, Cactus faced Funk in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Scramble Bunkhouse Deathmatch at the Honjo Gymnasium in Saitama, just north of Tokyo in front of 150 people in a match that involved barbed wire as the ring ropes and objects set on fire. This turned out to be a particularly chaotic and brutal match where Foley and Funk mostly brawled in the seating area amongst the crowd, with folding chairs flying everywhere. After several brutal spots involving flaming chairs, flaming iron rods, Funk Hip-tossing Cactus into a flaming chair and Funk slamming Cactus&#x27;s head into a wooden table, Funk reversed a Spinebuster by Cactus into a DDT and pinned him to win the match. In 2010 Foley wrote that, &quot;looking back that match in Honjo is probably the performance I&#x27;m proudest of.&quot; Cactus Jack later began a feud with the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface, whom he had betrayed during a tag team match.

But perhaps the most notable matches of Foley&#x27;s time in Japan were on August 20, where IWA organized a King of the Death Match tournament at their Kawasaki Dream event at the outdoor Kawasaki Stadium in its namesake city, which featured some of the bloodiest, most violent and most brutal matches of Foley&#x27;s career. The tournament was seen live by tens of thousands of people, and each level of the tournament featured a new and deadly gimmick: Cactus Jack&#x27;s first-round during the day was a barbed-wire baseball bat, thumbtack deathmatch, in which he defeated Terry Gordy; the second round was a barbed-wire board, bed of nails deathmatch where Cactus Jack defeated Shoji Nakamaki. At night against Terry Funk, the final was a barbed-wire rope, exploding barbed wire boards and exploding ring time bomb deathmatch, which Cactus Jack won with help from Tiger Jeet Singh. After the match, both men were covered in blood, ravaged by flesh cuts from the wire, and badly burned by the C-4 explosions. Foley later said that he only received $300 () for the entire night. After the tournament, Foley&#x27;s right arm had second-degree burns from the C-4 explosions from the match with Funk and his arm smelt of explosive chemicals. After a 14-hour flight from Tokyo&#x27;s Narita Airport to JFK Airport his father picked him up from the airport to take him back to his Long Island home, and immediately smelt something unusual. When Foley got home, his father and wife kept asking him about the awful smell, but he would not say anything, not wanting them to worry. After his father left, his wife persisted, so he revealed the burns to her.

Foley continued wrestling in Japan, Later on, he teamed with Tracy Smothers, Tiger Jeet Singh, the Headhunters, and Bob Bargail for multiple runs at the W*ING World Tag Team Championship, and a few runs at Tarzan Goto&#x27;s IWA World Heavyweight Championship. True to his hardcore style, other matches Foley took part in were more deathmatches that involved objects like bricks, body bags, thumbtacks, barbed wire and window panes, and some matches even involved fire. He would continue wrestling in Japan until June 1996; the last notable match Foley had as Cactus Jack in Japan was a &quot;Caribbean barbed wire barricade glass deathmatch&quot; against W*ING Kanemura, which Cactus won.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1996–2001) ===
==== Three faces of Foley (1996–1998) ====

In 1996, at the persistence of Jim Ross, whom Foley had known in his days in WCW, WWF head Vince McMahon had Foley sign a contract with WWF, and this time it wasn&#x27;t to use Foley as &quot;enhancement talent&quot;.

McMahon was not a fan of Cactus Jack and wanted to cover up Foley&#x27;s face, so he was shown several designs for a new heel character–a man with a leather mask and chains, called &quot;Mason the Mutilator&quot;. However, WWF decided that character as a whole was too dark and only kept the mask. Although interested in the concept of the character, Foley did not like the name, so he came up with the new name &quot;Mankind&quot;, which McMahon liked and approved of.

Mankind was an eerie and mentally deranged miscreant who dwelled in the boiler rooms of buildings, constantly squealed (even throughout his matches), randomly shrieked &quot;Mommy!&quot;, spoke to a rat named George, regularly took to acts of masochism (such as by pulling out his hair), and wore a mask seemingly constructed of oddly shaped pieces of leather that were patched together with rivets. Mankind&#x27;s finishing move was the &quot;Mandible Claw&quot;. The move is based on the &quot;Mandibular Nerve Pinch&quot;, a finishing move developed and utilized by former osteopathic physician and neurosurgeon-turned-wrestler, Sam Sheppard. This finishing maneuver is a nerve hold that&#x27;s applied when the aggressor plunges their middle and ring fingers into the opponent&#x27;s mouth, under their tongue and into the soft tissue at the bottom of the mouth, while simultaneously forcing their jaw upwards with the thumb or palm of the same hand; clamping pressure is then applied between the fingers inside the mouth, and the thumb or palm under the jaw. If applied genuinely and correctly, it purportedly compresses the two nerves within the tissues of the mandible which render the opponent&#x27;s jaw paralyzed, thus preventing the opponent from breaking the hold by biting the aggressing wrestler&#x27;s fingers. Its proper application purportedly causes a significant amount of legitimate pain that&#x27;s so intense it can inhibit the opponent&#x27;s vision, and if applied long enough, can force the opponent to black out. The creatively inclined and dedicated Foley initially would prepare for playing Mankind by researching the character, often spending the night in the respective arena&#x27;s boiler room and sometimes under the wrestling ring for the first few months, but after that, he could get into character almost instantly.

His catchphrase, ever perplexing, was &quot;Have a nice day!&quot; and his association with boiler rooms led to his specialty match, dubbed the boiler room brawl. This specialty match is chaotic and dangerous with significant violent use of weaponry all taking place inside an arena&#x27;s mechanical/boiler room. Combatants involved made use of everything from foreign objects to all sorts of exposed metal piping with large bolts, concrete flooring to solid electrical equipment, all allowed by the match&#x27;s no disqualification and no count-out rules. The objective of the match, in most cases, was to escape the boiler room first.

On the April 1, 1996, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; in San Bernardino, California, the day after WrestleMania XII, Mankind debuted on television and defeated Bob &quot;Spark Plug&quot; Holly, quickly moving into a feud with The Undertaker. At In Your House 7: Good Friends, Better Enemies later that month, The Undertaker defeated Mankind in a dark match. The two wrestlers then faced one another in a series of dark matches and house show matches until their first broadcast match against one another at King of the Ring in June 1996, where Mankind defeated The Undertaker using the Mandible Claw after The Undertaker&#x27;s manager Paul Bearer accidentally struck The Undertaker with an urn. The feud culminated in the first-ever &quot;Boiler Room Brawl&quot; at SummerSlam 1996, and in addition to escaping the arena&#x27;s boiler room, the combatant also had to reach the ring and take the urn from Paul Bearer. After more than 20 minutes of brawling in the boiler room, the backstage corridors, and the entrance ramp, and both men taking some bumps involving metal trash cans, tables, ladders, metal poles, hot coffee, and the exposed concrete floor, The Undertaker appeared to have won, but Paul Bearer refused to hand him the urn, allowing Mankind to win, thus (for the time being) ending the relationship between Paul and The Undertaker. While Paul Bearer was Mankind&#x27;s manager, Mankind referred to him as &quot;Uncle Paul&quot;. Mankind then became the number one contender to face the then WWF Champion Shawn Michaels at In Your House: Mind Games. Michaels won by disqualification via interference by Vader and The Undertaker.

The Mankind and Undertaker rivalry continued with the first-ever buried alive match at In Your House 11: Buried Alive. Undertaker won the match, but Paul Bearer, the Executioner, Mankind and other heels attacked The Undertaker and buried him alive. Afterward, The Undertaker challenged Mankind to a match at Survivor Series 1996, which the Undertaker won. The feud continued after another match at In Your House 14: Revenge of the &#x27;Taker for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which Undertaker had won at WrestleMania 13. Undertaker won the match and Bearer took a leave of absence, continuing the feud. Jim Ross then began conducting a series of interviews with Mankind. During the interviews, Ross brought up the topic of Foley&#x27;s home videos, the hippie-inspired character he played in them, Dude Love, and his tormented journey in wrestling. The interviews also affected the fans, who began cheering Mankind, even though he was still a heel at this point.

Around this time, Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels won the WWF Tag Team Championships from Owen Hart and the British Bulldog, but Michaels was injured and could no longer compete. Mankind tried to replace him, but Austin said he wanted &quot;nothing to do with a freak&quot; and resigned himself to facing Hart and the Bulldog alone the next week. Halfway into the match, however, Foley debuted a new face persona known as &quot;Dude Love&quot;, who helped Austin take the victory, becoming the new Tag Team Champions. Dude Love had some new and renamed moves, such as the &quot;Love Handle&quot; (a renamed Mandible Claw) and &quot;Sweet Shin Music&quot; (a simple kick to the shins, a play on Shawn Michaels&#x27;s superkick finishing move). Austin and Foley vacated their tag team titles when Austin suffered a neck injury in a match at SummerSlam in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Dude Love feuded with Hunter Hearst Helmsley, as the two competed in a falls count anywhere match. One of Foley&#x27;s most memorable vignettes aired before the match began, in which Dude Love and Mankind discussed who should wrestle the upcoming match. Eventually, &quot;they&quot; decided that it should be Cactus Jack, and Foley&#x27;s old character made his WWF debut as a face. Cactus Jack won the match with a piledriver through a table.

In September 1997, Foley (as Mankind) wrestled Sabu at Terry Funk&#x27;s WrestleFest, an event organized to mark the retirement of Foley&#x27;s friend Terry Funk. Funk, however, broke his retirement soon after the event, and in December 1997, he joined the WWF as &quot;Chainsaw Charlie&quot;, aligning himself with Foley.

At the 1998 Royal Rumble, Foley participated under all three personas, Cactus Jack (1st entrant), Mankind (16th), and Dude Love (28th). Charlie and Cactus defeated the New Age Outlaws at WrestleMania XIV in a dumpster match to win the tag team titles (which was originally supposed to be a barbed-wire rope match- but this often violent and bloody match was scrapped due to the high-profile appearance of Mike Tyson taking part at the event). The next night, however, Vince McMahon stripped them of the belts, citing that Charlie and Cactus had put the Outlaws in a random backstage dumpster and not the original dumpster brought ringside and scheduled a rematch in a steel cage, which the Outlaws won with help from their new allies, D-Generation X. On April 6, 1998, Foley turned heel when Cactus explained that the fans would not see him anymore because they did not appreciate him, and only cared about Stone Cold Steve Austin: after a hard-fought match with Terry Funk in Albany, fans started to leave the arena a minute or so before their match ended. Howard Finkel, the ring announcer there announced that Austin, who was the hottest wrestler in the WWE at the time would be making an appearance- and the crowd exploded at the news, and many rushed back to their seats. Foley later admitted that this crowd reaction emotionally hurt him, that his hard work could not compete with Austin&#x27;s popularity and that he would be just another wrestler to face the company&#x27;s megastar. Vince McMahon explained to Austin the next week that he would face a &quot;mystery&quot; opponent at . That opponent turned out to be Dude Love, who won the match by disqualification, meaning that Austin retained the title. McMahon, displeased with the outcome, required Foley to prove he deserved another shot at Austin&#x27;s title with a number one contenders match against his former partner, Terry Funk. The match was both the WWF&#x27;s first-ever &quot;hardcore match&quot; and the first time that Foley wrestled under his name. Foley won, and after the match, a proud McMahon came out to Dude Love&#x27;s music and presented Foley with the Dude Love costume. At Over the Edge: In Your House, Dude Love took on Austin for the title. McMahon designated his subordinates Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson as the timekeeper and ring announcer and made himself the special referee. However, the Undertaker came to ringside to ensure McMahon called the match fairly, and with his presence, Dude Love lost the match and was &quot;fired&quot; by McMahon on the June 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

On that same episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley reverted to his Mankind character, who had become a more human and less creature-like character and began wearing an untucked dress shirt with a loose necktie, and also resumed his feud with The Undertaker. At King of the Ring 1998 in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Civic Arena on June 28, the two performed in the third Hell in a Cell match, which became one of the most notable matches in professional wrestling history. Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential bumps – the first being tossed off the top of the high Cell by The Undertaker, crashing through the Spanish announcer&#x27;s wooden table and landing on the arena&#x27;s concrete floor. Barely five minutes after the first bump, Foley, with a separated shoulder, climbed back up to the top of the Cell structure after Terry Funk and others tried to stop him. The second bump, which was an unplanned botch, occurred when The Undertaker chokeslammed Foley and the fenced panel Foley landed on broke and gave way. Foley then plunged through the Cell and landed on the ring mat, losing a tooth. Mankind lost the match to conclude their storyline.

==== WWF Champion (1998–2000) ====

Following a couple of months of teaming with Kane who together won the WWF Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions and various feuds with Kane, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Undertaker, Foley decided that crowds might respond better if Mankind were more of a comedy character, and so he abandoned the tortured soul characteristics and became more of a goofy, broken down oaf. He began the transition into this character following SummerSlam in 1998 after Kane turned on him and the two lost the tag team championships.

The following month, Foley began an angle with Vince McMahon, with Mankind trying to be a friend to the hated Mr. McMahon. On the October 5 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, while McMahon was in a hospital nursing wounds suffered at the hands of The Undertaker and Kane, Mankind arrived with a female clown called Yurple in an attempt to cheer him up. Having succeeded only in irritating McMahon, Mankind then took a disgusting sock off his foot and placed it on his hand to create a sock puppet named &quot;Mr. Socko&quot;. Intended to be a one-time joke and suggested by Al Snow, Socko became an overnight sensation. Mankind began putting the sock on his hand before applying his finisher, the Mandible Claw, stuffing a smelly sock in the mouths of opposing wrestlers. Mankind also became a smelly sock puppeteer, having the sock “speak” in a high-pitched voice. The sweatsock became massively popular with the fans, mainly because it was marketed (mostly by Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler during the events) as being a dirty, smelly, sweaty, repulsive, and vile sock. McMahon manipulated Mankind, who saw the WWF owner as a father figure, into doing his bidding. McMahon created the WWF Hardcore Championship and awarded it to Mankind, making him the first-ever champion of the hardcore division. Mankind was then pushed as the favorite to win the WWF Championship at Survivor Series, as McMahon appeared to be manipulating the tournament so that Mankind would win. He and The Rock both reached the finals, where McMahon turned on Mankind. As The Rock placed Mankind in the Sharpshooter, McMahon ordered the timekeeper to ring the bell even though Mankind did not submit, a reference to the Montreal Screwjob from the year before. As a result of the Survivor Series, Mankind officially turned face, while The Rock turned heel and became the crown jewel in McMahon&#x27;s new faction, the Corporation.

After weeks of trying to get his hands on the Corporation, Mankind received a title shot against The Rock at Rock Bottom: In Your House. Mankind won the match by using his mandible claw hold (with the Mr. Socko prop on his hand) and the referee declared The Rock had become unresponsive. But McMahon overruled the title change because Mankind didn&#x27;t keep his pre-match promise to make The Rock submit. After several weeks of going after the Corporation, Mankind defeated The Rock to win his first WWF Championship on December 29 in Worcester, Massachusetts. The taped show was broadcast on January 4, 1999, so that is the date WWE recognizes as beginning the title run. Having title changes on broadcast television rather than pay-per-view was uncommon in professional wrestling, but because of the Monday Night War, television ratings became more important. The head of rival promotion WCW Eric Bischoff, attempting to take advantage of the fact that their show &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; aired live while Mankind&#x27;s title victory was taped the week before, had announcer Tony Schiavone reveal the ending of the Mankind-Rock match before it aired. He then added sarcastically, &quot;That&#x27;s gonna put some butts in the seats.&quot; The move backfired for WCW, as Nielsen ratings showed that Raw won the ratings battle that night, despite the Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash main event which led to the reformation of the New World Order (nWo). Foley said that the ratings indicate that large numbers of viewers switched from &quot;Nitro&quot; to &quot;Raw&quot; to see him win the title and took great personal pride from this – and WCW never beat the WWF in the television ratings ever again.

Mankind lost the WWF Championship to The Rock in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match (a type of submission match) at the Royal Rumble at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, California, near Los Angeles, in what is regarded as one of the company&#x27;s most brutal matches. During the match, Foley took several violent and dangerous bumps from The Rock all over the arena, including repeated steel chair shots to the head and a fall from the stands onto solid electrical objects, which sparked upon impact. Although steel chair shots to the head were commonplace in the Attitude Era, the most a wrestler would take in a single ten-minute match was two, or sometimes three, with their hands in front of their head to ease the blow and lessen a chance of a concussion. However, Foley had taken eleven in the span of two and a half minutes, all unprotected, because he had been handcuffed just before The Rock began his repeated onslaught. Foley was originally supposed to take five chair shots to the head with the final match-ending shot being two-thirds up the entrance ramp; but, after the sixth shot, Foley was still at ringside and, even after Foley signaled to The Rock to hit him in the back, The Rock decided to keep to the match&#x27;s brutal tone based on Foley&#x27;s previous on-the-fly calling of similar shots on the spot, and he hit Foley five more times in the head until they got to the two-thirds mark. This match is featured in Barry Blaustein&#x27;s documentary &quot;Beyond the Mat&quot;, which shows the impact the match had on Foley, his family, and even the rest of the audience at ringside, and at one point Foley&#x27;s wife Collette and five-year-old daughter Noelle both cried and screamed in horror, with Noelle believing her father was dying as The Rock pummeled Foley with repeated chair shots. The match at this point had become so brutal that some people in the audience sitting in the front furiously showed signs of disapproval at The Rock and shouted at him and the referee to stop the match. The match ended after Mankind lost consciousness, and The Rock&#x27;s allies played a recording of Mankind saying &quot;I Quit&quot; from an earlier interview he did with Shane McMahon.

Mankind won the title back in a rematch on Halftime Heat, which aired during halftime of Super Bowl XXXIII, in the WWF&#x27;s first-ever empty arena match in Tucson, Arizona, on January 31. After 20 minutes of brawling in the ring, the empty grandstands, a kitchen, the arena&#x27;s hallways, an office, and the catering hall, Mankind took a filthy sock off his foot and stuffed it into The Rock&#x27;s mouth and then used a forklift to pin a subdued Rock in a basement loading area. The two then competed in a Last Man Standing match at St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre: In Your House, which ended without a winner, meaning that Mankind retained the title. The next night, Mr. McMahon booked a ladder match for the championship, which The Rock won with help from The Big Show. Mankind would go on to WrestleMania XV to defeat The Big Show and again at Backlash a month later in a violent and brutal Boiler Room Brawl (the first in the WWF since July 1996), where the objective of the match had been simplified from the 1996 match to only having to escape the boiler room. Shortly after, Big Show would team with Mankind, Test and Shamrock to take on the Corporation at Over The Edge. Later in the year, Foley and The Rock patched up their friendship and teamed up to form a comedy team called the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection, becoming one of the most popular teams during that time. The pair won the tag team titles on three occasions. One notable match was a Buried Alive match that pitted the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection against The Undertaker and The Big Show, who were out for revenge after losing the tag titles one week earlier. This match included a spot where The Big Show tossed Mankind off the stage, landing hard on the dirt and falling into the grave- Mankind traveled nearly in total. Foley then helped &quot;Raw is War&quot; achieve its highest ratings ever with a segment featuring himself (as Mankind) and The Rock. The &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; segment aired on September 27, 1999, and received an 8.4 rating, with Yurple the Clown making another appearance. Foley briefly reverted to his Cactus Jack persona for a Hardcore handicap match against Ministry of Darkness members Viscera and Mideon on May 10, 1999, which Cactus won; the match saw Cactus enter using two basketballs as weapons.

In August 1999, Foley returned after a three-month absence recovering from knee surgery to resume his feud with Triple H, who had kayfabe injured Foley&#x27;s left knee with his sledgehammer. On an episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Mankind drew with Triple H in a match for the number one contender for the WWF Championship, which resulted in a Triple Threat match between Steve Austin, Triple H and Mankind at SummerSlam where Mankind won the WWF Championship for a third time by pinning the reigning champion Austin. Mankind&#x27;s win led to an enraged Triple H to assault Austin, justifying Austin&#x27;s absence while he healed a knee injury. The next night on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Triple H defeated Mankind to win his first WWF championship. A feud then developed between Mankind and Triple H. This included Triple H defeating Mankind in another Boiler Room Brawl on the September 23 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, as part of a five-match &quot;gauntlet&quot; challenge set upon Triple H by Vince McMahon. It was around this time that Foley began to realize he was going to have to retire soon- in addition to the massive physical toll he had inflicted on his body, Foley then began to develop cognitive problems such as forgetting simple bodily motions and trouble remembering how to write and spell basic words. Foley&#x27;s last match was supposed to be a tag team match with Al Snow in November 1999, but with the WWF having to go on with the absence of their biggest star Stone Cold Steve Austin at the time (who was out with a broken neck), Foley felt that the company would suffer too badly if another one of its biggest stars disappeared from the roster, even with The Rock surging in popularity. So Foley, even in the poor condition he was in, decided to go on for a few more months until Austin returned, and this is when he continued his feud with Triple H.

Mankind received a title shot against Triple H on an episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot; on October 25, 1999. Mankind appeared to have the title won after he forced Triple H to pass out by ramming a smelly sock down Triple H&#x27;s gullet, but Val Venis interfered and cost Mankind the match. Mankind continued his feud with Triple H when he was supposed to have the last Boiler Room Brawl match with &quot;Santa Claus&quot;. He ended up being attacked by the Mean Street Posse, Billy Gunn and Road Dogg, all dressed up as Santa Claus. Mankind defeated all 5 of these Santa Clauses until Triple H appeared as a 6th Santa Claus and brought down Mankind, escaping the Boiler Room and winning as &quot;Santa Claus&quot;. On the December 27, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Mick Foley and the Rock had a &quot;Pink Slip on a Pole match&quot;, where whoever was first to grab the pink slip first stayed in WWF with the loser having to leave, in which Foley lost. Foley then showed up as Mankind on the January 13, 2000, edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and then reverted to his Cactus Jack persona in front of the crowd to promote Cactus Jack facing Triple H for the WWF Championship at Royal Rumble, in a Street Fight. Cactus used a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire, and thumbtacks- trademark weapons from his pre-WWF days, but Triple H won the match after delivering two pedigrees, the second slamming Cactus face-first onto a pile of tacks. This feud culminated with a rematch at No Way Out in a Hell in a Cell match, where stipulations held that Cactus could not use foreign metallic objects he used in the Royal Rumble, and if he did not win the title, Foley had to retire from wrestling. During the match, they had made their way onto the top of the cell and Cactus was preparing to piledrive Triple H onto a barbed wire 2x4 on fire, but Triple H reversed it into a backdrop, causing the cage to give way, and Cactus fell through the canvas. Triple H then pinned an exhausted Cactus, winning the match and Foley&#x27;s career was over. Foley left for a few weeks, but returned at the request of Linda McMahon to wrestle for the title by replacing Chris Jericho&#x27;s spot at the main event of WrestleMania 2000 against Triple H, The Rock and Big Show. Triple H won, and Foley did not wrestle again for four years.

==== Commissioner and departure (2000–2001) ====

After retiring from active competition, Foley served as storyline WWF Commissioner under his real name rather than one of his personas. Foley has said that he intended for his Commissioner Foley character to be a &quot;role model for nerds,&quot; cracking lame jokes and making no attempt to appear tough or scary. He also had a knack during this time to have no one spot for his office; rather, Foley would have an office in all sorts of odd places (for example, closets). Foley turned getting cheap pops into something of a catchphrase, as he shamelessly declared at each WWF show that he was thrilled to be &quot;right here in (whatever city in which he was performing (e.g., New York))!&quot; punctuated with an intentionally cheesy thumbs-up gesture. During this time, Commissioner Foley engaged in rivalries with Kurt Angle, Edge and Christian, and Vince McMahon without actually wrestling them. He left the position in December 2000 after being &quot;fired&quot; onscreen by McMahon during which he received a brutal beat down at the hands of Angle, Edge and Christian.

Foley made a surprise return on the &quot;Raw&quot; just before WrestleMania X-Seven and announced that he would be the special guest referee in the match between Mr. McMahon and his son Shane at WrestleMania. After WrestleMania, Foley made sporadic appearances on WWF programming throughout the middle of the year, at one point introducing Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura during a taping of &quot;Raw&quot; in the state as a foil to Mr. McMahon, as well as serving as the guest referee for the Earl Hebner versus Nick Patrick referee match and a tag-team bra and panties match between WWF wrestlers Lita and Trish Stratus vs. WCW wrestlers Stacy Keibler and Torrie Wilson at the Invasion pay-per-view. Foley returned as commissioner in October 2001, near the end of The Invasion angle. During this brief tenure, Foley had the opportunity to shoot on the WWF&#x27;s direction and how dissatisfied he was with it. Saying that there were far too many championships in the company, he booked unification matches before the final pay-per-view of the storyline, Survivor Series. After Survivor Series, he ended his commissionership at Vince McMahon&#x27;s request and left the company.

=== Various promotions; Ring of Honor (2003, 2004–2005) ===
On December 12, 2003, Foley served as the special guest referee for a Terry Funk vs. Dusty Rhodes match promoted by the International Wrestling Cartel.

On September 11, 2004, Foley made his debut for Ring of Honor (ROH) and cut a promo, praising ROH and referring to it as &quot;Ring of Hardcore&quot;, thus establishing himself as a face. On October 15, Foley returned to ROH where he confronted Ricky Steamboat, who claimed that traditional wrestling was better than hardcore wrestling. During this confrontation Foley also cut a scathing promo on Ric Flair, as part of his real-life animosity over Flair referring to Foley as a &quot;glorified stuntman&quot; in his autobiography. The next day, both Foley and Steamboat cut promos on each other, leading to a match between two teams of wrestlers handpicked by both men, with Nigel McGuiness and Chad Collyer representing Steamboat and Dan Maff and B. J. Whitmer representing Foley, which was won by McGuiness and Collyer. On November 6, Foley teased a heel turn when he called ROH Champion Samoa Joe &quot;softcore&quot;. On December 26 at ROH&#x27;s Final Battle event, Foley returned to ROH and had his final confrontation with Ricky Steamboat, where the two made peace. On January 15, 2005, Foley turned heel after being confronted by Samoa Joe and hit Joe over the head with a steel chair. On February 19, Foley resumed his feud with Samoa Joe in ROH, teasing a return to the ring but instead choosing Vordell Walker to fight Joe. After Joe defeated Walker, Foley introduced his &quot;backup plan&quot; New Cactus Jack to fight Joe in a second match, which Joe won as well. On July 8, Foley returned to ROH as a face, confronting ROH Champion CM Punk, who had turned heel and mocked ROH and the championship after he had signed with WWE and threatened to take the title with him to WWE. Foley acted as a direct line to Vince McMahon, attempting to convince Punk to defend his title one last time on McMahon&#x27;s orders before he departed from ROH. On August 20, Foley returned to ROH again, as a face, to rescue Jade Chung from Prince Nana. Foley was then attacked from behind by Alex Shelley and The Embassy until Austin Aries and Roderick Strong chased them off. Foley made his final regular appearance with ROH on September 17, when he was in A.J. Styles&#x27; corner in a match against Embassy member Jimmy Rave, which Styles won. Afterward, Foley spoke highly of Ring of Honor.

=== Return to WWE (2003–2008) ===
==== Various feuds (2003–2006) ====
Foley returned to WWE to referee the Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and Kevin Nash at Bad Blood on June 15, 2003. On the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; broadcast from Madison Square Garden, he was honored for his achievements in the ring and presented with the retired WWE Hardcore Championship belt. The evening ended with Foley taking a beating and kicked down a flight of stairs by Randy Orton and Ric Flair. On the December 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley returned to replace Stone Cold Steve Austin as co-general manager of the Raw brand. He soon grew tired of the day-to-day travel and left his full-time duties to write and spend time with his family. In the storyline, Foley was afraid to wrestle a match with WWE Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton on the December 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and walked out of the match rather than face him, the result of the match was ruled a draw. After Foley walked backstage, Orton confronted him asking why he walked out of the match and calling him a coward before spitting in his face. Foley walked out of the arena afterward.

Foley returned briefly to wrestling, competing in the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004 and eliminating both Orton and himself with his trademark Cactus Jack clothesline. He and The Rock reunited as the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection and lost a handicap match to Evolution at WrestleMania XX on March 14. Foley and Orton continued to feud, culminating in a hardcore match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship at Backlash on April 18, where a thumbtack-covered Orton defeated Foley, as his Cactus Jack persona, to retain the title after hitting Foley with his signature move, the &quot;RKO&quot; onto a barbed-wire covered baseball bat. Foley regards this match as possibly the best of his career.

Foley appeared as a color commentator at WWE&#x27;s ECW One Night Stand on June 12, 2005, and subsequently renewed his contract with WWE. Foley returned in a match where fans were able to vote on which persona he would appear as—Mankind, Dude Love, or Cactus Jack—against Carlito at Taboo Tuesday on November 1. The fans voted for Mankind, who went on to defeat Carlito- this was the last time Foley ever wrestled as Mankind. On the February 16, 2006 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley returned to referee the WWE Championship match between Edge and John Cena. After Cena won, Edge attacked Foley, and the following week, Foley (who from now on would resemble Cactus Jack in his wrestling show appearances and matches, but would still wrestle under his own name) challenged Edge to a hardcore match at WrestleMania 22 on April 2. In the intensely brutal match, the heavily bloodied and thumbtack-covered Edge defeated Foley after spearing him through a flaming table, where both performers suffered second-degree burns after anti-flame material was sweated off of both performers and was not applied to the flaming table, at their own request. In the weeks after the match, an &quot;impressed&quot; Foley aligned himself with Edge against the newly rejuvenated ECW on the May 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, turning heel in WWE for the first time since 1998. At ECW One Night Stand on June 11, Foley, Edge and Lita defeated Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer and Beulah McGillicutty in a violent and brutal tag-team hardcore match, which included a spot where Funk hit Foley with a barbed wire 2x4 plank lit on fire, and the flame latched onto Foley, and he then fell onto a plywood board covered in more barbed wire.

Foley then engaged in a storyline rivalry with Ric Flair, inspired by real-life animosity between them. In &quot;Have a Nice Day!&quot;, Foley wrote that Flair was &quot;every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it.&quot; In response, Flair wrote in his autobiography that Foley was &quot;a glorified stuntman&quot; and that he was able to climb the ladder in the WWF only because he was friends with the bookers. The two had a backstage confrontation at a &quot;Raw&quot; event in December 2004 in Huntsville, Alabama, but Foley has said that they have largely reconciled. To spark the feud, Flair again called Foley a &quot;glorified stuntman&quot; and Foley called Flair a &quot;washed-up piece of crap&quot; and challenged him to a match. The result was a Two-out-of-Three Falls match at Vengeance on June 25, where Flair beat Foley in two straight falls. The two then wrestled in an intensely brutal and bloody &quot;I Quit&quot; match at SummerSlam on August 20. In the beginning of the match, Foley stuffed his smelly gym sock, Mr. Socko, down Flair&#x27;s gullet to apply the Mandible claw. Flair nearly passed out from the sock&#x27;s foul smell, but since the match was an “I Quit” match, Foley was unable to capitalize. Flair, who was covered in blood, thumbtacks and cuts from barbed wire, won the match when he forced Foley to quit by threatening Melina with a barbed-wire bat. On the August 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley kissed Vince McMahon&#x27;s buttocks as part of McMahon&#x27;s &quot;Kiss My Ass Club&quot; gimmick after he threatened to fire Melina. Shortly thereafter, Melina betrayed Foley and announced that he was fired.

==== Sporadic appearances and SmackDown color commentator (2007–2008) ====
Seven months later, Foley returned on the March 5, 2007 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; with the storyline being that he tricked McMahon into giving him his job back, turning face once again. At on June 24, Foley wrestled in a WWE Championship Challenge match involving WWE Champion John Cena, Randy Orton, King Booker, and Bobby Lashley. Cena retained by pinning Foley. A month later, Foley made an appearance on &quot;Raw&quot; as the special guest referee for a match between Jonathan Coachman and Mr. McMahon&#x27;s storyline illegitimate son Hornswoggle. Foley then made an appearance on &quot;SmackDown&quot; the same week, where he defeated Coachman with Hornswoggle as the special guest referee. On the January 7, 2008, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley and his tag team partner Hornswoggle qualified for the Royal Rumble on January 27 by defeating The Highlanders, but Foley was eliminated by Triple H during the Royal Rumble match.

Foley debuted as a color commentator for SmackDown alongside Michael Cole at Backlash on April 27, replacing Jonathan Coachman. On the August 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Foley was kayfabe attacked by Edge during Edge&#x27;s promo for his Hell in a Cell match against The Undertaker at SummerSlam on August 17. Foley sat out the August 8 &quot;SmackDown&quot; to sell his recovery from the injuries. Tazz filled in for Foley as a color commentator on &quot;SmackDown&quot;, while Raw wrestler Matt Striker filled in for Tazz on &quot;ECW&quot;. Foley told Long Island Press pro wrestling columnist Josh Stewart in August 2008 that &quot;creatively, the announcing job wasn&#x27;t working out too well&quot;. He expanded with Dave Meltzer on the Observer radio show that the environment was creatively frustrating. Foley allowed his contract with WWE to expire on September 1, 2008, and quietly left the company.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling / Impact Wrestling (2008–2011, 2020) ===

==== Championship reigns (2008–2009) ====
On September 3, 2008, Foley&#x27;s agency, Gillespie Talent, issued a press release that stated Foley had signed a short-term deal with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Foley claimed in the statement to be &quot;very excited about the specifics of this agreement and the potential it holds&quot;. Foley made his TNA debut on September 5, at a TNA house show giving a short speech about how he loved the product, in which he also belittled WWE. The official TNA Wrestling website featured an image of a smiley face with a variation of Foley&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Have a nice day!&quot; (and, before No Surrender on September 14, &quot;Have a nice Sunday!&quot;).

On the September 18 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Foley made his first televised appearance for TNA, where Jeff Jarrett introduced him to the audience on the arena&#x27;s video wall. Two weeks later, Foley made his full television debut in a promo making comments about the WWE roster, Vince McMahon and Kurt Angle. At Bound for Glory IV on October 12, he was the special guest enforcer for Jarrett and Angle&#x27;s match. Later, on &quot;Impact!&quot;, Foley said goodbye, but was then approached by Jeff Jarrett with a new offer; he later indicated that they had come to terms on a new contract and would make a major announcement the next week. On the October 23 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Foley announced that he was now co-owner of TNA along with Jarrett, just after Kurt Angle headbutted him.

On the November 27 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, TNA presented the Turkey Bowl. Alex Shelley ended up being pinned by Rhino, and Foley handed Rhino the check. Afterward, the defeated Shelley had to put on a Turkey Suit in compliance with the match rules, albeit with much refusal. However, Shelley &quot;flipped off&quot; Foley and proceeded to beat him up. In the aftermath, Mick mentioned that Shelley is lucky he still has his job. The Main Event Mafia&#x27;s Kevin Nash, Booker T, and Scott Steiner were going to take on Brother Devon, A.J. Styles, and Mick Foley in his debut matchup at Genesis on January 11, 2009. Nash, however, suffered a legitimate staph infection and missed Genesis. He was replaced by Cute Kip. Foley got the pin when he hit Scott Steiner with a double arm DDT onto a chair.

At Lockdown on April 19, he defeated Sting to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for his first-ever championship in TNA, and his fourth World title overall. At Sacrifice on May 24, Foley put his title on the line against Kurt Angle, Jeff Jarrett and Sting. During the match, Foley stuffed a dirty old sock into the mouths of Jarrett and Sting, but Sting pinned Angle to become the new leader of the Main Event Mafia. Due to the rules of the match, Foley retained the title.

Foley had also stated on &quot;Impact!&quot; tapings that if he retained the TNA World Heavyweight Title at the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary on June 21, he would only put the title up in a match once a year. However, he lost the title to Kurt Angle in the King of The Mountain match at Slammiversary. He received a rematch at Victory Road on July 19, commenting he had only submitted once in his career (to Terry Funk, in a spinning toe hold) and swore he&#x27;d never do it again. He lost the match when Angle forced him to submit again with the ankle lock.

On July 30, on the 200th episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Foley won the TNA Legends Championship by pinning champion Kevin Nash in a tag team match where Nash teamed with Angle and Foley with Bobby Lashley. At Hard Justice on August 16, Nash defeated Foley to regain the title, following interference from Traci Brooks.

==== Various storylines (2009–2011, 2020) ====
On the September 24 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Foley turned heel when he attacked Abyss during and after a TNA World Tag Team Championship match against Booker T and Scott Steiner. Foley revealed Abyss as the one who tore up his picture and attacked him with a videotape and the baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire. Abyss then challenged Foley to a Monster&#x27;s Ball match which Foley accepted. At Bound for Glory on October 18, Abyss defeated Foley in the match. Two weeks later on the October 29 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Foley turned on Dr. Stevie and saved Abyss from him, turning face once again. The following week he explained that he had played Dr. Stevie all along and had challenged Abyss to a match at Bound for Glory to see how tough he was. On the edition of November 12 of &quot;Impact!&quot; Raven returned to TNA and saved Stevie&#x27;s future in the company by costing Abyss a match and throwing a fireball in Foley&#x27;s face.

After this, Foley turned his attention away from Abyss and Dr. Stevie and concentrated on Hulk Hogan&#x27;s arrival in TNA, appearing to be paranoid about Hogan taking over TNA. On the edition of December 3 of &quot;Impact!&quot; Foley teased another heel turn by booking face Kurt Angle in a handicap match, after Angle refused to give him information on who Hogan is bringing to TNA. At Final Resolution on December 20, Abyss and Foley defeated Stevie and Raven in a &quot;Foley&#x27;s Funhouse&quot; tag team match. On the live January 4, 2010 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the day of Hulk Hogan&#x27;s debut for TNA, Foley was assaulted by the reunited Kevin Nash, Scott Hall and Sean Waltman, when trying to get a meeting with Hogan. On the January 21 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; new Executive Producer Eric Bischoff fired Foley, after claiming to have been attacked by him. On the February 11 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Bischoff and Foley &quot;talked it over&quot;, as Hogan had suggested two weeks prior, and Foley was entered in the 8 Card Stud Tournament at Against All Odds on February 14. The match was a No Disqualification match against Abyss, who won the match and advanced. On the March 15 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Bischoff announced that he would be shaving Foley bald as a punishment for trying to help Jeff Jarrett in a handicap match the previous week. At first, Foley was seemingly going along with the plan, but at the last second he shoved Mr. Socko down Bischoff&#x27;s throat, put him on the barber&#x27;s chair and shaved him nearly bald. On the following edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Foley lost to Jarrett in a No Disqualification Career vs. Career match set up by Bischoff, forcing Foley to kayfabe leave TNA. In reality, Foley was taken off television due to him being on his way to exceed the maximum number of dates per year on his contract, at the pace he was making appearances.

Foley returned to TNA on the July 15 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, leading an invasion of fellow ECW alumni TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam, Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Stevie Richards, Rhino, Brother Devon, Pat Kenney and Al Snow forming the team of EV 2.0. The following week, TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay–per–view event, Hardcore Justice: The Last Stand on August 8, as a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to ECW. At Hardcore Justice, Foley refereed a Final Showdown match between Tommy Dreamer and Raven. On the following edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, the ECW alumni, known collectively as Extreme, Version 2.0 (EV 2.0), were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair&#x27;s stable, who thought they didn&#x27;t deserve to be in TNA. In August, Foley began writing a weekly column for TNA&#x27;s website. On the October 7, 2010, live edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Foley defeated Ric Flair in a Last Man Standing match. the Last Man Standing match with Flair turned out to be Foley&#x27;s last match in TNA. At Bound for Glory on October 10, Foley was in EV 2.0&#x27;s corner, when Dreamer, Raven, Rhino, Richards and Sabu defeated members Styles, Kazarian, Morgan, Roode and Storm in a Lethal Lockdown match. After not appearing for two months, Foley returned on the December 23 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, confronting Fortune and Immortal. After Genesis on January 9, 2011, Foley once again disappeared from TNA television, but kept making regular appearances at TNA house shows. At the tapings of the May 12 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Foley made his return to television as he was revealed as the &quot;Network&quot; consultant, who had been causing problems for Immortal for the past months. On May 23, Foley, who had expressed frustration with TNA and said that he did not plan to renew his contract with TNA once it would expire in the fall of 2011, made a joke on Twitter, comparing his Empty Arena match with The Rock to a TNA house show. On the following edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; on June 2, Hulk Hogan announced that Foley had been fired as the Network Executive. This was done to write Foley, who had asked for his release from TNA, off television. His departure from TNA was confirmed on June 5, 2011.

On October 24, 2020, Foley made a brief return to Impact Wrestling at the 2020 Bound for Glory via video message to congratulate Ken Shamrock for his induction into the Impact Hall of Fame.

=== Second return to WWE (2011–present) ===
==== Last matches and final retirement (2011−2012) ====

Foley returned to WWE at a house show in Dublin, Ireland, taking a break from his UK comedy tour, on November 2, 2011, making an in-ring promo with The Miz and R-Truth and then guest refereed the tag team match, appearing again in Manchester on November 5. Foley returned to television on the November 14 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot;, which featured him presenting a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; celebration for John Cena (he presented a similar segment for The Rock 12 years earlier). Among those brought out were Cena&#x27;s former tag team partner Bull Buchanan, his former baseball coach (kayfabe), and his father; however the segment was interrupted by The Rock, who delivered a Rock Bottom to Foley before leaving the ring, ending the segment. Foley was the special guest host on the live edition of &quot;SmackDown&quot; on November 29.

Foley appeared on the January 16, 2012 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot; to announce his intentions to participate in the Royal Rumble match at the 2012 Royal Rumble pay-per-view later in the night during a six-man tag team match CM Punk needing a tag Foley came down to the ring and got tagged in the match; he defeated David Otunga but John Laurinaitis reversed the decision because Foley was not an official participant of the match. The next week, he also appeared, wishing Zack Ryder good luck in his match against Kane that night. Foley participated in the Royal Rumble match at the 2012 Royal Rumble pay-per-view where he entered at number 7 and eliminated Justin Gabriel (with the help of Ricardo Rodriguez), Epico, and Primo, eventually being eliminated by Cody Rhodes after 6 minutes and 34 seconds. The match was ultimately won by Sheamus. This was Foley&#x27;s last night as an active wrestler. Foley later appeared in a segment alongside Santino Marella at WrestleMania XXVIII. On April 10, 2012, Foley made an appearance on &quot;WWE SmackDown: Blast from the Past&quot;. He returned on the June 18 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot; announcing that he would be serving as the temporary general manager of both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; for the week. On July 23, at the 1000th episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he appeared as Dude Love, danced with Brodus Clay and performed the mandible claw on Jack Swagger with a tie dyed Mr. Socko. In 2012, he hosted the &quot;WWE: Falls Count Anywhere – The Greatest Street Fights and other Out of Control Matches&quot; DVD. On the September 24, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley made an appearance to confront CM Punk, telling him to accept a match against John Cena. Later in the show, however, Punk attacked Foley backstage. At Hell in a Cell, CM Punk successfully retained his WWE Championship against Ryback due to interference from the referee, Brad Maddox. The next day on &quot;Raw&quot;, CM Punk announced he would be facing Team Foley at Survivor Series in a traditional Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination match for which Foley had accepted the challenge. However Punk had been removed from the match the following week. On the November 12, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley was appointed the Special Guest Enforcer in the match between CM Punk and John Cena. Foley&#x27;s hand-picked Survivor Series team of The Miz, Randy Orton, Kofi Kingston and Team Hell No failed to defeat Team Ziggler in the Traditional 5-on-5 Survivor Series Elimination Tag Match. Foley portrayed Santa Claus on the December 24 pre-taped edition of&quot; Monday Night Raw&quot;. Foley as Santa was run over by Alberto Del Rio. However, he managed to recover later in the night and help Cena defeat Del Rio in a Miracle on 34th Street Fight match.

In August 2012, Foley was originally scheduled to have a match with the debuting Dean Ambrose at SummerSlam. However, doctors could not medically clear Foley, so Foley announced his final retirement from in-ring competition.

==== Hall of Famer and various appearances (2013−2016) ====
On January 11, 2013, WWE.com announced that Foley would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2013 by his longtime friend Terry Funk. The official announcement was made on the 20th Anniversary of &quot;Raw&quot; on January 14. At the February 26 taping of &quot;Saturday Morning Slam&quot; (that aired March 16), Foley was named as the new general manager for the show. Foley returned on April 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to confront Ryback until he was saved by John Cena. Foley appeared as part of the Extreme Rules post-show to provide an analysis. On the December 18 episode of &quot;Main Event&quot; he appeared As &#x27;Foley Claus&#x27;, helping The Miz defeat Curtis Axel. In April 2014, Foley didn&#x27;t re-sign his Legends contract with WWE.

On the October 20, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley returned during a segment with Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins where he discussed the cases of their match at Hell in a Cell. Throughout December 2014, Foley appeared in segments on &quot;Raw&quot; as Saint Mick alongside his daughter Noelle. In 2015, Foley appeared at SummerSlam, where he kicked off the event with host Jon Stewart. Foley returned to &quot;Raw&quot; on March 14, 2016, in a backstage segment with Dean Ambrose, in which he gave him a pep talk for his upcoming WrestleMania 32 match against Brock Lesnar and a passing of the torch in the form of his iconic barbed wire baseball bat, &quot;Barbie&quot;. On April 3, 2016, at WrestleMania 32, Foley returned in-ring alongside Shawn Michaels and Stone Cold Steve Austin in a post-match interruption where the trio of Hall of Famers took on The League of Nations after they had defeated The New Day and proclaimed &quot;No three people can ever defeat us.&quot; Foley brought out Mr. Socko and executed the Mandible Claw two times during the fight, once on Sheamus and once on King Barrett. The latter was part of a three-way finishing move sequence where Barrett was first hit with Sweet Chin Music by Shawn Michaels, staggered and fell into Mr. Socko, and finally hit with a Stone Cold Stunner.

==== Raw General Manager (2016–2017) ====

On the July 18, 2016, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley was appointed by Stephanie McMahon as the general manager of Raw. Foley unveiled new titles exclusive to the Raw brand, while also making fair decisions to favor the faces and occasionally disagreeing with Stephanie McMahon. One of Foley&#x27;s first decisions as Raw General Manager was pitting the feuding Sheamus and Cesaro against one another in a Best of 7 series. Going into Clash of Champions the duo were tied 3–3. At Clash of Champions, both men would be counted out resulting in a draw and the best of seven series being declared a draw. On the next night&#x27;s episode of &quot;Raw&quot; Foley who had promised the victor a championship opportunity would put the two in a tag team. On the November 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley would place Sami Zayn in a match against Braun Strowman after Zayn failed to defeat The Miz at Survivor Series for the WWE Intercontinental Championship to bring the title to &quot;Raw&quot;. During the match, Foley would order the match to be stopped, deeming Zayn unable to continue. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Zayn would demand a rematch against Strowman, but Foley would decline, telling Zayn he could not beat him, making Zayn storm off in anger. On the December 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Zayn would once again ask for a rematch with Strowman but was once again rejected by Foley. Zayn would then tell Foley he was pondering going to &quot;SmackDown&quot; because Foley did not believe in him. Later that night, after Zayn defeated Jinder Mahal, Foley would tell him he has arranged a trade with &quot;SmackDown&quot; for him in exchange for Eva Marie. Zayn would angrily refuse the trade and once again demanded a rematch with Strowman. Foley would yield, giving Zayn his match with Strowman at with a ten-minute time limit.

On the March 13, 2017, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Stephanie McMahon forced Foley to fire a member of the &quot;Raw&quot; roster by the end of the night. Foley chose to fire Stephanie McMahon herself, which prompted Triple H to come out and confront Foley. After being insulted and ordered to leave the ring, Foley instead attacked Triple H, stuffing a stinky sock in Triple H&#x27;s mouth via &quot;Mr. Socko&quot; before being low blowed by McMahon. Seth Rollins would then come out to aid Foley, only to be attacked by Triple H. On the March 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Stephanie McMahon would fire Foley for his actions the previous week. A few weeks later Foley made an appearance at the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2017 ceremony.

==== Sporadic appearances (2018–present) ====
On the September 10, 2018, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Foley interrupted Elias with the announcement that in speaking with Stephanie McMahon regarding the upcoming 20th anniversary of his Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker at King of the Ring that he would be appointed special guest referee for the WWE Universal Championship match between Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman at the September Hell in a Cell PPV event. At Hell in a Cell, Brock Lesnar would interfere in the contest with Paul Heyman spraying Foley in the eyes with pepper spray, as a result; the match was ruled a no-contest. Following the show, a Mick Foley 20 Years of Hell special was aired on the WWE Network. On the May 20, 2019, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Foley returned to unveil a new championship. He unveiled the 24/7 Championship announcing a scramble for the title. In July, he announced that he wanted to challenge R-Truth for the championship. However, that didn&#x27;t occur due to being attacked by Bray Wyatt, now appearing as &quot;The Fiend&quot; on &quot;Raw&quot;.

On the November 7, 2023, episode of NXT, Foley announced who will be in the qualifiers for the Iron Survivor Challenge at NXT Deadline.

== Writing career ==

Foley is a multi-time &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author, particularly known for his ongoing series of memoirs. His writing has generally received favorable reviews.

From May 7 to July 1, 1999, Foley wrote his autobiography – without the aid of a ghostwriter, as he noted in the introduction – in almost 800 pages of longhand. The book, &quot;Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks&quot; was released on October 31, 1999, and topped &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; non-fiction bestseller list for several weeks. The follow-up, &quot;Foley Is Good: And the Real World Is Faker than Wrestling&quot;, was released on May 8, 2001.

The third part of his autobiography, &quot;The Hardcore Diaries&quot;, highlights his 2004 feud with Randy Orton, his match and later partnership with Edge, and program with Ric Flair in 2006. &quot;The Hardcore Diaries&quot; was released on March 6, 2007, also spent time on the New York Times bestseller list. Foley&#x27;s &quot;Countdown to Lockdown&quot; was released on October 1, 2010. On September 30, 2010, Joey Styles interviewed Foley on WWE.com – even though Foley was under contract with TNA – about his new book, while Michael Cole plugged the book on the edition of September 27 of &quot;Raw&quot; and a piece was published by Foley in &quot;Slate&quot; of which portions were adapted from &quot;Countdown&quot;. WWE&#x27;s promotion of a product released by an employee of a rival company was a quite unusual move and a welcome surprise for Foley, who has since stated that he was delighted at the respect shown by his former employer. On November 10, 2010, Foley appeared on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and &quot;Off the Record&quot; to discuss the book and his charity work. &quot;Countdown to Lockdown&quot; became Foley&#x27;s first memoir to not make the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

His fifth autobiography, &quot;Saint Mick&quot;, was released on October 17, 2017.

Foley has also written four children&#x27;s books, &quot;Mick Foley&#x27;s Halloween Hijinx&quot;, &quot;Mick Foley&#x27;s Christmas Chaos&quot;, &quot;Tales from Wrescal Lane&quot; and &quot;A Most Mizerable Christmas&quot;, in addition to two novels: &quot;Tietam Brown&quot;, a coming-of-age story which was nominated for the WHSmith People&#x27;s Choice Award in 2004 and &quot;Scooter&quot;, was published in August 2005.

One of Foley&#x27;s earliest acting roles was in 1996. Shortly before he joined the WWF, Foley appeared in Atlanta filmmakers Barry Norman and Michael Williams&#x27; short subject &quot;Deadbeats&quot; as &quot;Bird&quot;, an armed robber turned debt collector. One of Foley&#x27;s first TV guest appearances was as a wrestler on USA Network&#x27;s short-lived action-comedy &quot;G vs E&quot;.

The event was billed the &quot;Total Xtreme Comedy show&quot; and also featured comedians Brad Williams, Bret Ernst and Ring of Honor&#x27;s Colt Cabana, who was also making his stand-up debut.

=== Filmography ===



== Activism ==
Much of Foley&#x27;s charitable work revolves around children. Among his involvement, Foley has volunteered with &quot;Camp Adventure&quot; helping kids coping with cancer, has participated in numerous Make-a-Wish Foundation events, has made surprise visits to children in hospitals, and has visited schools and libraries to talk to students about the value of education and the importance of reading. Foley sponsors seven children with ChildFund International (formerly Christian Children&#x27;s Fund), a group he has been affiliated with since 1992. In recent years, he has become one of the fund&#x27;s leading donors, helping fund childhood education centers in the remote areas of the Philippines and Mexico, as well as four small community schools in the West African nation of Sierra Leone. After visiting the country in November 2008, an experience he called &quot;one of the best experiences of my life; maybe the best,&quot; Foley committed to funding a larger primary school, which was completed in September 2009.

Foley has visited U.S. troops at various military bases and military hospitals. For several years Foley visited wounded soldiers at Washington, D.C.–based military hospitals on almost a monthly basis, becoming known as a &quot;Legend among hurt troops,&quot; according to a &quot;Washington Times&quot; article.

Having become a devoted fan of Tori Amos&#x27; music in 1993, (particularly the song &quot;Winter&quot; from the &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot; album), and following a meeting with Amos at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, Foley became involved with the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN), a group Amos co-founded in 1994. Since then, he has worked as a volunteer on their online hotline and as a member of their National Leadership Council. During a 15-month period ending in April 2011, Foley logged more than 550 hours talking to victims online. The same month, Foley offered to mow anyone&#x27;s lawn who donated at least $5,000 to the organization, stating, &quot;If you want to help survivors of sexual assault, or just want to see a big guy with long hair mowing your lawn in front of your friends, please take part...&quot;

Continuing his campaign for the organization, in May 2011, Foley auctioned off on eBay two famous items associated with his wrestling career: his Cactus Jack lace-up &quot;leopard skin&quot; boots (still embedded with 149 thumbtacks from his &quot;Impact&quot; match with Ric Flair); and the white shirt that he wore as Mankind during 1998&#x27;s &quot;Hell in a Cell&quot; match, among other items.

Foley has been outspoken in his support for the Democratic Party. During the 2004 election cycle, Foley argued the Democratic point of view in a WWE-sponsored debate against John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield, who spoke for the Republican side. He was a contributor to Barack Obama&#x27;s campaign for the U.S. presidency in 2008. In a video uploaded to his official YouTube channel on October 23, 2024, Foley endorsed Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election after denouncing Donald Trump&#x27;s threats to deploy the military to purge &quot;the enemy from within&quot;.

<text>Sonic Corporation, founded as Sonic Drive-In and more commonly known as Sonic (stylized in all caps), is an American drive-in fast-food chain owned by Inspire Brands, the parent company of Arby&#x27;s, Jimmy John&#x27;s, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Dunkin&#x27; Brands. Sonic, founded by Troy N. Smith Sr., opened its first location in 1953, under the name Top Hat Drive-In. Originally a walk-up root beer stand outside a log-cabin steakhouse selling soda, hamburgers, and hotdogs, Sonic currently has 3,545 locations in the United States. Sonic is known for its use of carhops on roller skates, and hosts an annual competition (in most locations) to determine the top skating carhop in the company. The company&#x27;s core products include the &quot;Chili Cheese Coney&quot;, &quot;Sonic Cheeseburger Combo&quot;, &quot;Sonic Blasts&quot;, &quot;Master Shakes&quot;, and &quot;Wacky Pack Kids Meals&quot;.

==History==

Following World War II, Sonic founder Troy N. Smith Sr., returned to his hometown of Seminole, Oklahoma, where he became employed as a milkman. He decided to work delivering bread because bread is lighter than milk. Soon afterwards, Smith purchased the Cottage Cafe, a little diner in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Before long, he sold it and opened a fast-food service, Troy&#x27;s Pan Full of Chicken, on the edge of town. In 1953, Smith joined with a business partner to purchase a five-acre parcel of land that had a log house and a walk-up root beer stand named the Top Hat. The two continued operating the root beer stand and converted the log house into a steak restaurant. After realizing that the stand was averaging $700 a week in the sale of root beer, hamburgers, and hot dogs, Smith decided to focus on the more-profitable root beer stand. He bought out his business partner.

Initially, Top Hat customers parked their automobiles anywhere on the gravel parking lot and walked up to place orders. In Louisiana, Smith saw a drive-in that used speakers for ordering. He suspected that he could increase his sales by controlling the parking and having the customers order from speakers at their cars, with carhops delivering the food to the cars. Smith borrowed several automobiles from a friend who owned a used-car lot to establish a layout for controlled parking. He also had some so-called &quot;jukebox boys&quot; wire an intercom system in the parking lot. Sales immediately tripled. Charles Woodrow Pappe, an entrepreneur, saw the Shawnee drive-in and was impressed. Smith and he negotiated the first franchise location in Woodward, Oklahoma, in 1956, based on a handshake. By 1958, two more drive-ins were built, in Enid and Stillwater.
Upon learning that the Top Hat name was already trademarked, Smith and Pappe changed the name to Sonic in 1959. The new name worked with their existing slogan, &quot;Service with the Speed of Sound&quot;. After the name change, the first Sonic sign was installed at the Stillwater Top-Hat Drive-In. This was the first of three Sonics in Stillwater. The original Sonic with the first sign was demolished and renovated in May 2015. Although Smith and Pappe were being asked to help open new franchise locations, no real royalty plan was in place. The pair decided to have their paper company charge an extra penny for each Sonic-label hamburger bag it sold. The proceeds would then be split between Smith and Pappe. The first franchise contracts under this plan were drawn up, but still no joint marketing plan, standardized menu, or detailed operating requirements were in place.

===1960s and 1970s===
Sonic&#x27;s founders formed Sonic Supply as a supply and distribution division in the 1960s. Under Smith, longtime franchise holders Marvin Jirous and Matt Kinslow were hired to run the division. In 1973, Sonic Supply was restructured as a franchise company that was briefly named Sonic Systems of America. It provided franchisees with equipment, building plans, and basic operational instructions. As the company grew into a regionally known operation during the 1960s and 1970s, the drive-ins were mainly in small towns in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Missouri, and Arkansas. In 1967, the year Pappe died, the brand had 41 drive-ins. By 1972, this number had risen to 165, and by 1978, 1000.

In 1968, Sonic introduced the Pickle-O&#x27;s, fried pickle slices.

In 1977, the company established the Sonic School for manager training. Franchisees operated most of the drive-ins and often made the store manager a business partner, which is the case even to the present day.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1983, the company&#x27;s board of directors hired C. Stephen Lynn as president. In 1984, Lynn hired attorney J. Clifford Hudson to head the legal department. Under Lynn, Sonic and its major franchisees began to encourage the development of local-advertising cooperatives, under the leadership of Keith Sutterfield as advertising manager and later as VP of marketing in which Sutterfield developed a field structure to work with the franchisees. New franchises began to expand the company into new areas and redevelop markets that had been unsuccessful in the past. These developments, combined with a major advertising campaign featuring singer and actor Frankie Avalon, led to significant growth and a new image that made Sonic a nationally recognized name. In 1986, Lynn, with a group of investors, completed a $10-million leveraged buyout and took the company private. The next year, Sonic moved its offices to leased space in downtown Oklahoma City and began to assume a higher profile in the community.

In 1991, Sonic became a publicly traded company again. By 1994, the corporation had renegotiated the franchise agreements with its franchisees.

During the mid-1990s, Sonic opened 100–150 new stores a year. Beginning in 1998, Sonic began a retrofit program, called &quot;Sonic 2000&quot;, to redesign and update all stores in its chain to what was called a &quot;retro-future&quot; look.

===2000s===
Hudson was named chairman of Sonic Corp. in January 2000.

In September of 2002, Sonic Corporation introduced PartnerNet to its franchisees, an intranet array of services which for the first time, digitally linked all Sonic Drive-in locations to Sonic Corporation. The new intranet was via Hughes Satellite Services and provided advancements like credit card processing and video training. The compulsory service package was headlined with the introduction of Sonic Live Radio by StudioStream Signature Sound, featuring a toll-free request line, 866-SONIC-FM, and live on-air personalities. The live radio style was first of its kind for corporate America, later emulated by the likes of Walmart. Sonic Live Radio, in beta since 2001, was released to all locations in February of 2003.

Sonic gained further attention in 2003 following the release of comedic reality show &quot;The Simple Life&quot; starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. Hilton and Richie, previously with no experience in having a job, had to work in a Sonic site in Altus, Arkansas.

Celebrating its 50th birthday in 2003, Sonic briefly added the Birthday Cake Shake to the menu. As a part of the anniversary celebration, Pickle-O&#x27;s made another appearance as a recurring item. Development milestones celebrated in the 2000s include the opening of the th Sonic Drive-In in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and the th Sonic Drive-In in the Chicago market (Algonquin, Illinois). In October 2004, President Pattye Moore stepped down to spend more time with her family.
On June 28, 2005, helped by new menu items and increased advertising exposure, Sonic Corp. reported double-digit increases in net income and revenue in the third quarter that year. On January 5, 2005, the company started to install card readers in the drive-in stalls at its 544 company-owned locations by the end of January that year. In 2007, the company opened its first stores in the Northeastern United States, in Waretown, New Jersey.

In 2009, Sonic partnered with DonorsChoose.org on a collaborative effort, Limeades for Learning, the chain&#x27;s first systemwide cause marketing initiative. Public school teachers request needed supplies and materials and Sonic customers vote on how to allocate over $500,000 each autumn. In the first seven years of the program, Sonic and its franchisees donated more than $6 million and impacted learning for more than 349,000 students nationwide.

In September 2009, Omar Janjua joined the company as president of its restaurant operating subsidiary, Sonic Restaurants, Inc. and left in 2015.

Despite growth into new markets outside their traditional footprint, the company was hit hard by the recession of 2008–2009. In 2009, the brand had multiple quarters of declines in same-store sales. Plans to bring Sonic to Alaska had not yet come to fruition. On October 26, 2015, Sonic opened its first Rhode Island location in Smithfield, reporting to have received 500 orders on its opening day. In the mid-2010s, the company began a refranchising effort and began to add to its numbers of stores again.

===2010s===
In January 2010, Sonic announced that they would begin switching to cage-free eggs, gestation crate-free pork, and chickens killed using controlled-atmosphere stunning methods instead of traditional shackling and electrical stunning. However, the company has subsequently backtracked on these commitments and has faced widespread public criticism.

Sonic reformulated its soft-serve ice cream to meet the FDA standards of identity that define what constitutes real ice cream and introduced Real Ice Cream on May 17, 2010. Several new hot dog items were also introduced in June 2010 and February 2011.

Craig Miller was hired as chief information officer in January 2012. In June 2010, Danielle Vona was hired as chief marketing officer.

In late 2010, Sonic announced the end of its 17-year relationship with advertising agency Barkley. A group of specialized agencies was selected to represent the company, and in early 2011, San Francisco-based Goodby Silverstein and Partners was named as the new creative agency for the company. In 2017, Sonic announced it would be adding seven new stores in Hawaii in the near future.

On September 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Inspire Brands, owner of Arby&#x27;s and Buffalo Wild Wings, announced that it would acquire Sonic for $2.3 billion. The acquisition was completed on December 7, 2018.

In September 2017, Sonic opened its first location in Alaska in Wasilla, and a year later it opened its second Alaska location in Fairbanks.

===2020s===
In 2020, Sonic unveiled a new drive-in design with an updated, wider layout for car docks and the drive-thru lane, a new kitchen layout built for efficiency, and an aesthetic makeover.

By March 2020, all locations indefinitely suspended patio dining due to COVID-19, but continued to serve take-away and pickup customers.

On November 21, 2020, a mass shooting occurred at the drive-thru of a Sonic Drive-In in Bellevue, Nebraska. Two people were killed, and two others were injured. A 23-year-old man was arrested; he had also allegedly made a bomb threat to the location before. In March 2022, the man pled guilty to all charges filed against him, including murder, attempted murder and arson. He asked to be sentenced to death, but was ordered to undergo mental health evaluation, and has not yet been sentenced as of 2023.

In 2020, Sonic was ranked 14th in &quot;QSR &quot;magazine&#x27;s rankings of the top-50 quick-service and fast-casual food brands in the nation.

==Company profile==

Although Sonic has operated since the early 1950s, Sonic Corp. incorporated in Delaware in 1990. It has its corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City; the headquarters building features a dine-in Sonic restaurant in an adjacent building. Prior to its acquisition by Inspire Brands, its stock traded on NASDAQ with the symbol SONC. Most restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees. Total 2016 revenues were around $100 million with net income of $18 million.

==Employee relations and opportunities==

In February 2019, employees of three Ohio locations resigned&quot; en masse&quot; due to management changes, as well as what they alleged was a 50% reduction of the employee hourly pay rate, a claim denied by Sonic.

As of 2019, Sonic carhops are still not able to receive tips from customers paying by credit or debit card. Tips can only be paid in cash, though some carhops make less than minimum wage. A petition on Change.org started in 2017 garnered over 33,000 signatures, but no change was made to Sonic&#x27;s policy. In 2020, Sonic added a tipping feature via the online ordering app. In 2021, Sonic added an option to tip at the stalls.

==Sonic Beach==

In June 2011, the first location under the name Sonic Beach was opened in Homestead, Florida. A second location, opened in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in November 2011, lacked drive-in stalls due to its beach-side location. Both locations included outdoor seating and flatscreen televisions, but have since closed. A third location was opened in Miami Gardens. The fourth location was opened January 2014 in Lauderhill.

Along with the traditional menu items, Sonic Beach offered several new items, including popcorn shrimp, Philly cheesesteaks, and pulled pork sandwiches. Sonic Beach serves beer and wine. Remaining locations have been rebranded under the traditional Sonic name, although retaining the Sonic Beach logo.

==Advertising==
Sonic ran its first television advertisement in 1977. One of the company&#x27;s most memorable advertising campaigns, which ran from 1987 to 1993, featured Frankie Avalon. In May 1999, the company began a new campaign featuring the character Katie the Carhop.

Sonic was also involved with NASCAR. The company contracted with Richard Childress Racing in late 2000 to be an associate sponsor for Dale Earnhardt Sr. during the 2001 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season. After Earnhardt died in an accident at the 2001 Daytona 500, the company continued its sponsorship with his replacement driver Kevin Harvick, through the end of the 2003 season. Sonic returned to NASCAR several years later to sponsor Sam Hornish Jr. and Richard Petty Motorsports in 2015.

In 2004, the company became more widely known nationally by advertising in television markets hundreds of miles from its nearest franchise. Improvisational actors T. J. Jagodowski and Peter Grosz became known to American television viewers from their &quot;Two Guys&quot; series of commercials. Similar series of ads for the company have featured other duos of improvisational performers, including Molly Erdman and Brian Huskey, Katie Rich and Sayjal Joshi, and Emily Wilson and Tim Baltz. In 2010, national auditions were held and a new series of commercials began airing, some of which featured carhops from Wisconsin and Austin, Texas. In 2012 the &quot;Two Guys&quot; returned to the company&#x27;s television ads. In 2018 Sonic supplemented their &quot;Two Guys&quot; commercials with complementary &quot;Two Gals&quot; commercials. The &quot;Two Gals&quot; are played by Ellie Kemper and Jane Krakowski. In 2020, Sonic shifted their &quot;Two Guys&quot; campaign to a new campaign known as &quot;Everyday People&quot; with the same formula but with families instead of guys.

<text>Harris Flanagin (November 3, 1817October 23, 1874) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 7th governor of Arkansas from 1862 to 1864, and in exile from 1864 to 1865. Prior to this he was a Confederate States Army officer who commanded infantry in the Western Theater of the American Civil War.

== Early life and education ==
Flanagin was born in the Roadstown section of Hopewell Township, Cumberland County, New Jersey, to James, a farmer and cabinetmaker, and Mary (née Harris) Flanagin. He was educated at a Quaker school in New Jersey and then went on to teach at Clermont Seminary in Frankford (present-day Philadelphia). Soon after he moved to Illinois, where he again tried teaching and while at this work studied law. In 1838 Flanagin moved to Arkansas, settling first at Pine Bluff, then Little Rock, then Clark County in 1839, and Arkadelphia in 1842. He served in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1842 to 1844 and the Arkansas Senate from 1848 to 1850. He was married on July 3, 1851, to Miss Martha Eliza Nash of Lafayette County. During the American Civil War Flanagin was promoted to colonel, commanding the 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles.

== Governor of Arkansas ==
In 1862, Flanagin was elected governor of Arkansas and resigned from the Army to take office. His administration dealt primarily with war related measures and maintaining order and continuing government while undergoing an invasion. The government was faced with shortages of critical items, rising prices, care of fallen soldier&#x27;s families, and related problems. During the American Civil War, the state government was forced to suspend the collection of taxes and financed the war with paper &quot;war bonds&quot;. When on September 10, 1863, the capital of Little Rock fell to Union forces and Arkansas&#x27;s state government fled the city, he seized as many government documents as he could and reestablished the capital at Washington, Arkansas. While governor Flanagin remained in Confederate controlled southwest Arkansas, a Union administration under provisional governor Isaac Murphy was inaugurated April 18, 1864, in the Arkansas State House at Little Rock.

== Later life and death ==
After the American Civil War, Flanagin returned the state archives and resumed his law practice in Arkadelphia. He died and is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery, Arkadelphia.

<text>Robert Beamon (born August 29, 1946) is an American former track and field athlete, best known for his world record in the long jump at the Mexico City Olympics in 1968. By jumping , he broke the existing record by a margin of and his world record stood for almost 23 years until it was broken in 1991 by Mike Powell. The jump is still the Olympic record and the second-longest in history unassisted by wind.

==Early life==
Robert Beamon was born in South Jamaica, Queens, New York, to Naomi Brown Beamon and grew up in the New York Housing Authority&#x27;s Jamaica Houses. When Beamon was eight months old, his mother died from tuberculosis, and, as a result of his stepfather&#x27;s incarceration, he was placed into the care of his maternal grandmother, Bessie.

When Beamon was attending Jamaica High School, Larry Ellis, a renowned track coach, discovered him. Beamon later became part of the All-American track and field team. Beamon began his college career at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University to be close to his ill grandmother. After her death, he transferred to the University of Texas at El Paso, where he received a track and field scholarship.

In 1965, Beamon set a national high school triple jump record and was second in the long jump. In 1967, he won the AAU indoor title and earned a silver medal at the Pan American Games, both in the long jump.

Beamon along with eleven other Black athletes were dropped from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) track and field team the week following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. for participating in a boycott of competition with Brigham Young University because of what has been described as the Book of Mormon&#x27;s racist teachings. Despite losing his athletic scholarship, Beamon returned to UTEP to continue his studies after the Mexico City Olympics. Fellow Olympian Ralph Boston became his unofficial coach.

==1968 Summer Olympics==

Beamon entered the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City as the favorite to win the gold medal, having won 22 of the 23 meets he had competed in that year, including a career-best of and a world&#x27;s best of that was ineligible for the record books due to excessive wind assistance. That year, he won the AAU and NCAA indoor long jump and triple jump titles and the AAU outdoor long jump title. He came close to missing the Olympic final, overstepping on his first two attempts in qualifying. With only one chance left, Beamon re-measured his approach run from a spot in front of the board and made a fair jump that advanced him to the final. There, he faced the two previous gold-medal winners, fellow American Ralph Boston (1960) and Lynn Davies of Great Britain (1964), and twice bronze medallist Igor Ter-Ovanesyan of the Soviet Union.

On October 18, Beamon set a world record for the long jump with a first jump of , bettering the existing record by . When the announcer called out the distance for the jump, Beamon—unfamiliar with metric measurements—still did not realize what he had done. When his teammate and coach Ralph Boston told him that he had broken the world record by nearly two feet, his legs gave way and an astonished and overwhelmed Beamon suffered a brief cataplexy attack brought on by the emotional shock, and collapsed to his knees, his body unable to support itself, placing his hands over his face. The defending Olympic champion Lynn Davies told Beamon, &quot;You have destroyed this event&quot;, and in sports jargon, a new adjective—&quot;Beamonesque&quot;—came into use to describe spectacular feats.

Before Beamon&#x27;s jump, the world record had been broken thirteen times since 1901, with an average increase of and the largest increase being . In the years following the jump, the mark was considered unbeatable. It took 12 years for another human being to jump 28 feet, much less 29. Beamon&#x27;s world record stood for 23 years until it was finally broken in 1991 when Mike Powell jumped at the World Championships in Tokyo, but Beamon&#x27;s jump is still the Olympic record and years later remains the second-longest wind-legal jump in history.

==Later life==
Shortly after the Mexico City Olympics, Beamon was drafted by the Phoenix Suns in the 15th round of the 1969 NBA draft but never played in an NBA game. In 1972, he graduated from Adelphi University with a degree in sociology.

In 1977, Beamon became a track coach at Alliant International University (formerly known as U.S. International University) in San Diego.

Beamon has worked in various roles to promote youth athleticism, including collaborations with former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Beamon&#x27;s work at the athletic programs of several universities. He is a graphic artist with work exhibited by the Art of the Olympians (AOTO), and was the former chief executive of the Art of the Olympians Museum in Fort Myers, Florida. In 2024, Beamon played percussion on a hip-hop jazz recording.

He is also a Global Ambassador for Special Olympics International.

==Honors==
Beamon is in the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, and when the United States Olympic Hall of Fame started to induct athletes in 1983, Beamon was one of the first inductees. There is a Bob Beamon Street in El Paso, Texas.
