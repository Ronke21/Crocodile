<text>Chaves () is a city and a municipality in the north of Portugal. It is 10 km south of the Spanish border and 22 km south of Verín (Spain). The population of the entire municipality in 2011 was 41,243, in an area of 591.23 km2. The municipality is the second most populous of the district of Vila Real (the district capital, Vila Real, is 60 km south on the A24 motorway). With origins in the Roman civitas Aquæ Flaviæ, Chaves has developed into a regional center. The urban area or city proper has 17,535 residents (2001).

==History==


Artefacts discovered in the region of Chaves identify the earliest settlement of humans dating back to the Paleolithic. Remnants discovered in Mairos, Pastoria and São Lourenço, those associated with transient proto-historic settlements and castros, show a human presence in the Alto Tâmega dating to the Chalcolithic. The region has seen persistent human settlement since Roman legions conquered and occupied the fertile valley of the Tâmega River, constructing a nascent outpost and taking over the existing castros in the area. The settlement was located at the convergence of three important Roman roads: the Bracara Augusta, Asturica, and Lamecum that crossed the Roman Province of Gallaecia, linking Rome to the region&#x27;s natural resources. It was a military centre known for its baths, which lasted until the 16th century. This civilization constructed protective walls to protect the local population; spanned the river with the bridge; promoted the baths (with its warm medicinal waters); exploited local mines and alluvial deposits and other natural resources. Its importance led to the urban nucleus being elevated to the status of &quot;municipality&quot; in 79 AD, during the reign of the first Flavian Caesar, Titus Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus. Its benefactor consequently influenced its toponymy, becoming known as Aquae Flaviae. Artefacts from the area around the Matriz church indicate that Aquae Flaviae&#x27;s centre was located in this place, in addition to an ancient headstone showing gladiatorial combat.

Rome&#x27;s hegemony lasted until the 3rd century, when, successively, the proto-Germanic tribes of the Suebi and Visigoths as well as the Alani colonized the imperial settlements of Chaves. Wars between Remismund and Frumar followed over their claims to the throne, which almost completely destroyed the village (it was settled in favour of Frumar, who imprisoned Idácio, the notable Bishop of Aquae Flaviae). Ironically, the Romans were complicit in Aquae Flaviae&#x27;s near destruction. Barbarian dominion lasted until the Moors invaded from North Africa, defeating the Visigoth King Roderic at the beginning of the 8th century.

In course, the name of Aquae Flaviae began to disappear, being supplanted by the more Hispanic-sounding &quot;Aquae Calidae&quot; ().

The area around Chaves surrendered to invading Islamic forces at around 714-716, forcing many resisting Christians to escape from Chaves into the mountains in the northwest. The city was conquered by Alfonso I of Asturias in 773, alongside Braga, Porto and Lamego, and repopulated in 868 by Alfonso III of Asturias. Battles between the Christians and Muslim forces then continued until the 11th century, when Alfonso V of León permanently reconquered Coimbra, establishing a firm buffer-zone to the south. He reconstructed, settled and encircled the settlement of Chaves with walls, in addition to establishing a Jewish quarter in the community. It was in the reign of Afonso I of Portugal that it was taken from León and firmly integrated into the Kingdom of Portugal domain (1160). Owing to its geographic location (on Portugal&#x27;s northern frontier with Spain), King Denis, ordered the construction of a castle to protect the kingdom&#x27;s border.

During the reign of Afonso II, when the king continued to provoke the ire of the Papacy, Portuguese knights attacked the Galician tenancy of his half-brother Martin Sanches (who lived in the kingdom of Alfonso IX of León), possibly since the Bishop of Braga had estates in that region. Provoking Sanches to invade northern Portugal. The Leonese fought battles in Barcelos, Braga and Guimarães, where they defeated Portuguese forces, before retiring to Galicia with their spoils. At the same time, Alfonso IX of León seized Chaves, which remained in Leonese hands until the reign of King Sancho II, when he and Ferdinand III met in 1230/1231. This was likely a self-serving decision on Fernando&#x27;s part, as he was fearful that Leonese barons would support Sancho against him. Alfonso IX continued to occupy Chaves as a method of ensuring his wife, Teresa, would be able to enjoy her properties in Portugal.

During the Portuguese Interregnum, the nobility of Chaves supported Beatrice of Portugal, as she was heir presumptive to King Ferdinand I, since he left no male heirs. The potential loss of independence of Portugal, through her marriage to John I of Castile resulted in the rebellion by the Master of the Order of Aviz (later King John I of Portugal), who would garner the support of the Portuguese Cortes, thus laying the seeds for his triumph at the Battle of Aljubarrota. Yet, many nobles refused to break their oaths of fealty to Beatrice (including in Chaves), necessitating John&#x27;s travel to Porto in force and scaring the nobles of Chaves and Bragança into capitulating.

The remnants of the Roman baths, and the houses used to assist the invalid, were demolished by the Count of Mesquitella at the end of the 17th century, in order to reinforce the defense of Chaves.

French forces invaded and attacked in 1807, during the Siege of Chaves, part of the Peninsular Wars. On 7 March 1808, Soult&#x27;s forces invaded northern Portugal to remove British forces from Iberia. Brigadier Francisco Silveira was charged with the defense of Chaves, but his 6000 men were unable to support its defense, and quickly abandoned the castle. An attempt to defend Chaves by Francisco Pizarro was futile, and the city surrendered to French forces shortly after the engagement. With too many troops to imprison Soult released many under oath, in order to continue the attack on the main forces who had retreated to the south. But Francisco Silveira did not quit, and as the main French went on to defeat the Anglo-Portuguese alliance at the First Battle of Porto, Silveira retook Chaves.

On 20 September 1837, the Convention of Chaves, which followed the Battle of Ruivães and which ended Chartist or Marshall&#x27;s Revolt, was signed in Chaves. Chaves was also a site of various religious apparitions, during the decade of 1830, eventually resulting in the construction of the &quot;Santuário da Nossa Senhora Aparecida&quot; ().

On 8 July 1912, forces loyal to the former monarchy, under the command of Henrique Paiva Couceiro, confronted government forces, commanded by Colonel Ribeiro de Carvalho, during the second monarchist incursion.

On 12 March 1929, the town of Chaves was elevated to the category of city.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===

Chaves is in the extreme north of Portugal, bounded on the north by Galicia (Spain), on the east by the municipalities of Vinhais and Valpaços, on the south by the municipality of Vila Pouca de Aguiar and on the west by the municipalities of Montalegre and Boticas. Chaves is one of the six municipalities of the Alto Tâmega, situated in the district of Vila Real, strategically positioned in the northwest of the Iberian peninsula and accessed by important international highways.

The region is dominated by the Quaternary Chaves sedimentary basin, a graben aligned on a north-northeast to south-southwest orientation bounded by the Hercynian massif and metamorphic schistose formations. Mixed with the schistose complex, there are bands of graphitic slates, mainly in the southern part of the urbanized area of Chaves and south-east of Faiões. To the north, and into Galicia, the basin extends into the depression of the Verin Basin. One of the oldest formations in the region, it dates back to the Ordovician period ( between 488.3±1.7 to 443.7±1.5 million years ago), is composed of schist and graywacke deposits. During the Ordovician-Silurian geological periods quartzites and schists were formed, metamorphosed by Hercynian granitic intrusions, at the end of the Paleozoic.

The Alpine orogeny was the main cause of extensive tectonic activities and it was responsible for the formation of the hydrothermal field within the region. The Chaves graben was formed by the relative motion of the block with different types of sediments being settled. The most recent formations are a sedimentary series (lacustrine, alluvial, colluvial, detritic, etc.) with variable thickness that had their origin during the Miocene. Two main faults cross and influence the tectonic activities: the north-northeast by south-southeast Chaves-Verin Fault and a fault system crossing near Faiões and Santo Estêvão. The first fault developed from late Hercynian tectonic episode occurring between 280 and 300 million years ago, that developed into an almost north–south direction into the lithosphere. Intense neotectonic activity reactivated these old fractures, originating in a complex pattern of faults in the sedimentary basin.

====Thermal springs====
Mineral waters are the clearest evidence of these recent tectonic fractures. The Penacova-Régua-Verín Fault, is an active formation that extends longitudinally for 500 kilometres, intermingled with other faults resulting in subterranean hydrology. The thermal springs, principally those in Campilho and Salus Vidago (in Vila de Vidago) have developed from this mixture of circumstances. With temperatures reaching , these mineral springs (bicarbonates, sodium, silicates and fluoride) in the vicinity of the city of Chaves, have provided a potential source of income.

The hot springs () were known since the Roman period, when the town was Aquae Flaviae; the &quot;Waters of Flavius&quot; were an important social gathering point, but fell into disuse as the town was slowly abandoned by attacks. The spas belong to a vast area of hydrothermal springs that stretch from Verín (in Galicia) to Pedras Salgadas, 30 km from Chaves (on the road to Vila Real). Despite its vastness and abundance of water, this thermal system is little utilized; of the nine groups of thermal springs there are only adequate installations in four of them: Chaves, Carvalhelhos, Vidago, Pedras Salgadas, and Verín. The waters of the spring, that are captured in three springs within Chaves, have mean temperatures of (the hottest bicarbonate waters in Europe). The modern spa industry in Chaves use these waters for numerous treatments, including stomach, liver, intestinal, and kidney ailments, through oral ingestion. Many small guesthouses in the old part of the town are dependent on the influx of these visitors. The thermal spas are located between the castle and the river, in front of a large area of grass-covered park with playgrounds and tennis courts.

===Climate===
Chaves has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with continental and oceanic influences.

The mountains between the Minho region and Trás-os-Montes serve as a climatic barrier and lessen rainfall closer to the interior. Places such as the Peneda-Gerês National Park, only away, can have up to five times the amount of precipitation Chaves gets in a year. Winters can be cold; January highs rarely surpass and lows are often below zero (54 days per year on average). Fog often hovers over the valley during the winter, usually lifting by midday, but on rare occasions can last for days, and can potentiate the development of rime ice. Cold fronts in the winter can often cause daytime temperatures to drop below . Snow is infrequent, especially in recent years, although the surrounding hills often receive a dusting. Temperatures in July and August frequently pass with nighttime temperatures dropping to . Summer brush fires can often make this season unpleasant although in recent years they have diminished, perhaps because most of the forest cover has been burnt. Chaves is one of the few places in Portugal with a dry March. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Chaves was on 22 January 1983.

====Demographics====

In the past 127 years, the municipality has seen a 29% increase in local population (from 31815 in 1864 to 40940 in 1991). This was not a gradual nor homogeneous increase, since there were periods of extreme growth or rapid decline. During the 20th century, growth after 1920 is notably influenced by the restriction of trans-Atlantic emigration, just like after 1991, the population decreases were associated with liberal emigration policies as a result of the Maastricht Treaty.

The parish populations have seen fluctuations, although the most recent census show that 31 of these agglomerations had population levels in 1991 much lower than their first tabulation. Further, analysis of the data identifies that the municipal increase (29%) was primarily from the more urbanized parishes, while peripheral rural/mountainous parishes show net decreases. Many of the local people have emigrated to settlements in northern Europe in addition to France, but commonly return or visit their villages for weddings or village festivals. Many residents of Chaves have also immigrated to Connecticut and New Jersey in the United States. 

Chaves has been isolated from the coastal urban centers and has suffered from a lack of convenient road communications. Recently, a new four-lane highway (A24) was opened to traffic. It links Chaves to Vila Real, and to the border with Spain. In Vila Pouca de Aguiar the highway also connects with the A7 that leads to Porto.

====City====

The population of the city encompasses 17,535 residents in the parishes of Santa Cruz-Trinidade, Madalena, and Santa Maria Maior: these parishes form the urbanized population of the city of Chaves.

Although many of the older buildings outside the historical walls were demolished to make way for apartment blocks, the medieval quarter with its &quot;Rua Direita&quot; and &quot;Rua de Santo António&quot; have been declared historic zones. In these areas there are narrow multi-story dwellings, whose origin has been limited by the walled city. Historically, the old quarter was the city, and few buildings were located outside its walls, since its frontier location and the imminent risk of invasion impeded the construction of homes outside the barriers. Consequently, space was limited and land primarily used for multi-purpose dwellings, resulting in very narrow streets and multi-story structures (with balconies that extend over the streets and protected the citizenry). Many of the lower floors were occupied by shops or small businesses, while the residents lived in the upper stories. Remnants of these verandas are still visible in the medieval quarter.

The walled city was at the forefront of the political turmoils during the Reconquista, transited by armies and sacked by enemies. Chaves was built, destroyed, and rebuilt several times by either faction (Christian and Muslim), when they occupied the castle (it is likely that for some periods the town was completely abandoned). In 1253, Afonso III supported the reconstruction of the castle. By 1258, Chaves was granted the status of a &quot;vila&quot; (or &quot;town&quot;). While the walls were eventually rebuilt, the advent of artillery would make the castle&#x27;s fortifications obsolete, and its importance waned, while the historical battlements fell into ruins.

On 15 November 2009 an extensive green space on the east side of the Tâmega River, between the Engenheiro Carmona Bridge and the Public Gardens, was opened to the public. It is an area with playgrounds, pedestrian and cycling paths, a beach football pitch, and a large grassy area. A modern pedestrian bridge was constructed to link the park and recreational area with the hot springs on the west bank of the river. At the same time cycling and walking paths were built on both banks of the river extending north for several kilometers. The pedestrian bridge, which is approximately 90 ft, is Chave&#x27;s tallest and most expensive bridge.

==Economy==
Agriculture and services are still the main sources of income. The traditional prosperity of Chaves comes, mainly, from a highly fertile plain, nine kilometres long and three to five wide, referred to as the&quot;veiga&quot;. Since the land can be irrigated with canals there is intensive farming of potatoes, corn, rye, hay, while plots of vegetables are also commonplace in the local market. The main canal begins near Vila Verde da Raia and crosses the valley on the right bank of the Tâmega as far as Nantes. On the whole, the land is made up of small plots that are rarely economically viable. There is some dairy farming, and a milk production unit on the south side of town, but few cows can be seen in the valley. In general most of the farmers are of retirement age and farming is often pursued more as a hobby than as a profession.

In addition to agriculture there are some small industries producing glass, tiles, and food products. Like Vila Pouca de Aguiar, located thirty kilometres south, this is a land of granite; there are several granite extraction and finishing industries located in Chaves, in addition to three brickworks, located on the south side of the city. Further, two mineral water plants, located in Vidago, belong to the municipality.

===Transportation===
It is serviced by A24 motorway, which links Chaves with the south, to Viseu, Coimbra and Figueira da Foz, connecting to Vila Pouca de Aguiar by the A7 (which acts as the gateway to the southern Trás-os-Montes), and the N103 from Bragança to Braga. Chaves is located 415 kilometres from Lisbon, 105 kilometres from Porto and just 55 kilometres from the district capital, Vila Real.

Between 1921 and 1990 Chaves was the northern terminus station of the Corgo line, a narrow gauge railway line which linked Chaves with Vila Real and Regua (the junction station for main line trains to Porto). The section between Chaves and Vila Real closed in 1990 and the remainder of the line closed in 2009.

Chaves Airport, a small, single runway airport for light aircraft, also serves the town.

==Architecture==

The town of Chaves is built upon a long military history, that includes many fortifications or vestiges of battlements. Apart from the medieval castle and 17th century forts (&quot;Forte de São Francisco&quot; and&quot;Forte de São Neutel&quot;), two medieval fortifications still exist: Santo Estêvão Tower (in the village of the same name north of Chaves) and Monforte Castle (in the hills east of the town).

<text>The Rutan Model 76 Voyager was the first aircraft to fly around the world without stopping or refueling. It was piloted by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager. The flight took off from Edwards Air Force Base&#x27;s 15,000 foot (4,600 m) runway in the Mojave Desert on December 14, 1986, and ended 9 days, 3 minutes and 44 seconds later on December 23, setting a flight endurance record. The aircraft flew westbound 26,366 statute miles (42,432 km; the FAI accredited distance is 40,212 km) at an average altitude of 11,000 feet (3,350 m).

==Design and development==
The aircraft was first imagined by Burt Rutan and his brother Dick Rutan in 1980. Burt sketched his concept for the aircraft for Dick and Jeana Yeager during a lunch in 1981. The idea was sketched out on the back of a napkin. Voyager was built in Mojave, California over a period of five years, mainly by volunteers working under both the Rutan Aircraft Factory and an organization named Voyager Aircraft. Burt Rutan served as the lead designer for the project, and the chief aerodynamicist was John Roncz.

The airframe made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, and Kevlar weighed when empty. With the engines included, the unladen weight of the plane was . When it was fully loaded with fuel for its historic flight it weighed . The aircraft had an estimated lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) of 27. The canard and wing airfoils were custom-designed, and the aircraft was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. Vortex generators were added to the canard to reduce sensitivity to surface contamination by rain. 

Voyager had front and rear propellers, powered by separate engines. It was originally flown on June 22, 1984, powered by Lycoming O-235 engines with fixed-pitch propellers. In November 1985, the aircraft was rolled out, fitted with world-flight engines, an air-cooled Teledyne Continental O-240 in the forward location and a liquid-cooled Teledyne Continental IOL-200 in the aft location. Both were firstly fitted with wooden, variable-pitch electrically actuated MT-Propellers. The plan was for the rear engine to be operated throughout the flight. The front engine was intended to provide additional power for takeoff and the initial part of the flight under heavy load.

On July 15, 1986, Dick Rutan and Yeager completed a test flight off the coast of California, in which they flew for 111 hours and 44 minutes, traveling in twenty circuits between San Luis Obispo and Stewarts Point, breaking the previous record held since 28 May 1931 by a Bellanca CH-300 fitted with a Packard DR-980 diesel engine, piloted by Walter Edwin Lees and Frederic Brossy which had set a record by staying aloft for 84 hours and 32 minutes without being refueled. The first attempt at the Voyager test flight was ended by the failure of a propeller pitch-change motor that resulted in an emergency landing at Vandenberg Air Force Base. On a test flight on September 29, 1986, the airplane had to make an emergency landing due to a propeller blade departing the aircraft. As a result, the decision was made to switch to aluminium Hartzell hydraulically actuated propellers. In a crash program, Hartzell made custom propellers for the aircraft, which were first flown on November 15, 1986.

==World flight==
Voyager&#x27;s world flight takeoff took place on the longest runway at Edwards AFB at 8:01 am local time on December 14, 1986, with 3,500 of the world&#x27;s press in attendance. As the plane accelerated, the tips of the wings, which were heavily loaded with fuel, were damaged as they unexpectedly flew down and scraped against the runway, ultimately causing pieces (winglets) to break off at both ends (the pilot had wanted to gain enough speed for the inner wings, rather than the fragile outer wings, to lift the plane; in 67 test flights, the plane had never been loaded to capacity). The aircraft accelerated very slowly and needed approximately 14,200 feet (2.7 mi; 4.3 km) of the runway to gain enough speed to lift from the ground, the wings arching up dramatically just before take-off. The two damaged winglets remained attached to the wings by only a thin layer of carbon fiber and were removed by flying the Voyager in a slip, which introduced side-loading, tearing the winglets off completely. Some of the carbon fiber skin was pulled off in the process, exposing the blue foam core. Burt Rutan following with pilot Mike Melvill determined that Voyager was still within its performance specifications despite the damage and decided to allow the flight to continue. During the flight, the two pilots had to deal with extremely cramped quarters. To reduce stress, the two had originally intended to fly the plane in three-hour shifts, but flight handling characteristics while the plane was heavy prevented routine changeovers, and they became very fatigued. Dick Rutan reportedly stayed at the controls without relief for almost the first three days of the flight.
The plane also continuously reminded the pilots of its pitch instability and fragility. They had to maneuver around bad weather numerous times, most perilously around the Typhoon Marge. Libya denied access to the country&#x27;s airspace in response to Operation El Dorado Canyon earlier that year. There were contentious radio conversations between the Rutan brothers as Dick flew around weather and, at one time, turned around and began doubling back. As they neared California to land, a fuel pump failed and had to be replaced with its twin pumping fuel from the other side of the aircraft.

In front of 55,000 spectators and a large press contingent, including 23 live feeds breaking into scheduled broadcasting across Europe and North America, the plane safely came back to earth, touching down at 8:06 a.m. at the same airfield 9 days after take-off. Rutan made three low passes over the landing field before putting Voyager down. The average speed for the flight was . There were of fuel remaining in the tanks, only about 1.5% of the fuel they had at take-off.

Sanctioned by the FAI and the AOPA, the flight was the first successful aerial nonstop, non-refueled circumnavigation of the Earth that included two passes over the Equator (as opposed to shorter ostensible &quot;circumnavigations&quot; circling the North or South Pole). This feat has since been accomplished only one other time, by Steve Fossett in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer (also designed by Rutan). For the feat, Yeager, the Rutans, and crew chief/builder Bruce Evans received the 1986 Collier Trophy.

<doc id="294065" wikidata="Q1053357" url="?curid=294065" title="Block size (cryptography)">
<text>In modern cryptography, symmetric key ciphers are generally divided into stream ciphers and block ciphers. Block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits. The length of this bit string is the block size. Both the input (plaintext) and output (ciphertext) are the same length; the output cannot be shorter than the input this follows logically from the pigeonhole principle and the fact that the cipher must be reversibleand it is undesirable for the output to be longer than the input.

Until the announcement of NIST&#x27;s AES contest, the majority of block ciphers followed the example of the DES in using a block size of 64 bits (8 bytes). However, the birthday paradox indicates that after accumulating several blocks equal to the square root of the total number possible, there will be an approximately 50% chance of two or more being the same, which would start to leak information about the message contents. Thus even when used with a proper encryption mode (e.g. CBC or OFB), only 232 × 8 B = 32 GB of data can be safely sent under one key. In practice a greater margin of security is desired, restricting a single key to the encryption of much less data  — say a few hundred megabytes. At one point that seemed like a fair amount of data, but today it is easily exceeded. If the cipher mode does not properly randomise the input, the limit is even lower.

Consequently, AES candidates were required to support a block length of 128 bits (16 bytes). This should be acceptable for up to 264 × 16 B = 256 exabytes of data, and would suffice for many years after introduction. The winner of the AES contest, Rijndael, supports block and key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, but in AES the block size is always 128 bits. The extra block sizes were not adopted by the AES standard.

Many block ciphers, such as RC5, support a variable block size. The Luby-Rackoff construction and the Outerbridge construction can both increase the effective block size of a cipher.

Joan Daemen&#x27;s 3-Way and BaseKing have unusual block sizes of 96 and 192 bits, respectively.

<text>The Solidarity Federation (SF; SolFed) is a British anarcho-syndicalist political organisation. It advocates for the abolition of capitalism and the state through industrial action, which it agitates for in industrial networks and local groups.

Originally established as the Syndicalist Workers Federation (SWF) in 1950, it became the British section of the International Workers&#x27; Association (IWA). In 1979, it reorganised into the Direct Action Movement (DAM), which participated in a number of industrial disputes during the 1980s and organised a short-lived couriers&#x27; union. Splits of anarchist communists from the organisation preceded its reorganisation into the Solidarity Federation, which it took the form of in 1994.

==History==
===Background===
During the Spanish Civil War, many British anarchists moved towards anarcho-syndicalism and formed syndicalist organisations to support the Spanish National Confederation of Labour (CNT). After the defeat of the Spanish anarchists in the war, the British anarchist movement attempted to reorganise itself, culminating in the establishment of the Anarchist Federation of Britain (AFB), which included anarchists of various different tendencies.

===Syndicalist Workers Federation===
By the end of World War II, syndicalists had risen to the leadership of the AFB, causing a split in the organisation. In August 1950, the syndicalists that were left over in the AFB reorganised into the Syndicalist Workers Federation (SWF). The SWF affiliated itself to the International Workers&#x27; Association (IWA), a syndicalist political international, as the organisation&#x27;s British section. The SWF was broadly syndicalist in orientation, rather than specifically anarcho-syndicalist. Many of the initial members of the SWF were pacifists, who rejected violence as a means of class conflict.

The SWF experienced a period of growth through the 1950s and 1960s. In 1965, an estimated 150 syndicalists were organising in Britain; 100 were affiliated with the exiled CNT and 50 with the SWF. During the late 1970s, the structures of the SWF began to change under the influence of new members, who had filtered into the organisation from the punk subculture. By the end of the decade, it only had one remaining local branch, located in Manchester.

===Direct Action Movement===
In March 1979, the remaining members of the SWF reorganised themselves into the Direct Action Movement (DAM), which experienced a period of growth throughout the early 1980s. The DAM initially sought support from the international syndicalist movement, but its organisational capacity was weak and British trade unionism was comparatively strong, so it was only capable of supporting existing industrial unions in Britain. Although the successor to an older organisation, the DAM themselves acknowledged that &quot;syndicalism in this country has not really existed since the early 1920s.&quot; Its &quot;Direct Action&quot; magazine, initially edited in the cut-and-paste style of a punk fanzine, took a more serious and professional editorial style when reporting on the industrial disputes of the 1980s.

The DAM supported the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–1985, which it recognised as a movement directed by the union rank-and-file, in spite of its own criticisms of the authoritarian politics of NUM leader Arthur Scargill. The DAM raised funds for miners&#x27; support groups, protested on picket lines and organised a congress to encourage solidarity actions from workers in other industrial sectors. One member of the DAM, the Doncaster-based Dave Douglass, was one of the few striking miners that self-identified as an anarchist; he was also critical of the NUM leadership and organised direct actions to &quot;improve the effectiveness of the miners&#x27; strike&quot;. In 1985, the DAM co-founded Anti-Fascist Action, within which it was active into the 1990s. The DAM later participated in the opposition to the poll tax and the protests against it. 

In the late 1980s, the DAM began attempting to establish its own anarcho-syndicalist unions as an alternative to the reformist unions. Its only success on this front was the establishment of the Dispatch Industry Workers Union (DIWU), which organised delivery couriers from 1989 to 1992. This change in policy provoked a number of splits from the organisation, as some members thought all unions were inherently reformist, even if they were anarcho-syndicalist in orientation. In 1986, the group Syndicalist Fight (SyF) split off and later merged into the Anarchist Communist Federation (ACF); and in 1987, the Anarchist Workers Group (AWG) split off and later merged into the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP).

===Solidarity Federation===
In 1994, the remnants of the DAM reorganised into the Solidarity Federation (SF), which adopted a new strategy. Rather than attempting to establish independent anarcho-syndicalist unions, the SF instead seeks to create networks of workers within existing unions, with the intention of participating in workplace struggles and propagandising for anarcho-syndicalism. After its formation, the SF became the British section of the IWA. It also took over publication of the magazine &quot;Direct Action&quot;, which was previously published by the DAM.

==Campaigns==

SolFed has carried out a series of direct action campaigns within the industries its members work in. One SolFed member, working within the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), organised a &quot;workmates experience&quot; campaign in the London Underground, where they organised against outsourcing and built solidarity between union and non-union workers. At Brighton University, SolFed established a &quot;pop-up union&quot; to organise precarious workers, despite the opposition of the University and College Union (UCU).

SolFed has formed close ties with the British branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and the two frequently collaborate, despite ideological and organisational differences. In Nottingham, the local SolFed group has participated in the Nottingham Association of Subversive Activists (NASA). On International Workers&#x27; Day, in 2000, SolFed participated in an anti-capitalist demonstration in London, during which a statue of Winston Churchill was vandalised. Following the rise of far-right politics in the United Kingdom in the 21st century, SolFed rejected working with Unite Against Fascism, which it criticised for &quot;class collaboration&quot;, and instead called for anti-fascism to be carried out through class struggle. This culminated in the early 2010s, SolFed supported the establishment of the Anti-Fascist Network, formed to provide an organised anarchist opposition to the English far-right.

Solidarity Federation&#x27;s 2012 national campaign against workfare initially focused specifically on Holland and Barrett, a health supplement corporation making use of placements staffed by unpaid benefits claimants. On 5 July 2012, after a sustained series of pickets at Holland and Barrett stores across the UK, the company announced via social media and its website that it was pulling out of the workfare scheme, citing negative publicity.

In October 2013, Brighton SolFed launched its Hospitality Workers Campaign, which aimed to bring together hospitality workers facing precarity and encourage solidarity and mutual aid between them. The campaign attracted support from the city&#x27;s Spanish migrant workers, many of whom worked in hospitality or healthcare for low pay and in poor working conditions. SolFed interviewed hospitality workers in order to identify abusive employers and inform them of their rights as workers in the UK. Workers were also provided with legal representation and encouraged to take industrial action. The campaign attracted significant support from hospitality workers, who for the most part were not unionised. 

In 2013, SolFed members in Liverpool participated in the People&#x27;s Assembly Against Austerity, but they later expressed disappointment with the experience, reporting that it had consisted largely of speeches without any organisation of political action. The following year, they collaborated with members of the Left Unity party to organise social centres, International Women&#x27;s Day events and political demonstrations against austerity.

==Organisation==
The Solidarity Federation is organised into industrial networks and local groups. SolFed has a federal structure, based on decentralised and autonomous groups, which it sees as both a means and an end. Following the organisational principles of anarcho-syndicalism, SolFed upholds participatory decision-making, in which individuals have the right to self-determination and decisions are driven by popular consensus. Members of SolFed are required to pay dues, which enables them to elect local representatives and a secretariat. SolFed opposes participation in political parties, as exemplified in its slogan &quot;The union not party&quot;. Unlike other anarcho-syndicalist organisations, SolFed is not itself a trade union, but rather a political organisation dedicated to the promotion of self-organisation and class consciousness.

Its industrial networks are organised as non-hierarchical and federal structures, which they intend to act as a synecdoche of post-capitalist social structures. This practice reflects a prefigurative politics, in which SolFed seeks to build &quot;a new society within the shell of the old&quot;; although unlike other anarcho-syndicalists, who see their own organisations as a prefiguration of a post-capitalist society, SolFed has resisted characterising itself as a universal form for organising society. Through its industrial networks, SolFed has organised in several economic sectors, including in the communication, education, public administration and transportation sectors.

Although their primary focus is on organising industrial workers, in the 21st century, SolFed has increasingly emphasised other forms of organising outside the setting of the workplace. SolFed has established a number of local organisations, which engage in community organising and social activism, alongside support for workplace activities. By the 2010s, SolFed counted 10 local groups, with 4 more locals in formation. It is relatively small organisation, with only a few hundreds members; as of 2015, it claimed to have 200 members.

SolFed refuses to pay for professional union officials, as it believes their interests would become separate from those of the rank-and-file and therefore make them more likely to seek compromises with employers. All official positions in the SF, whether taking minutes, chairing meetings or negotiating with other organisations, are temporary and unpaid positions, in order to keep their interests in line with that of the rank-and-file.

==Ideology==
The Solidarity Federation advocates for solidarity, which it views as a means for workers&#x27; empowerment. SolFed believes that profit-seeking is the main cause of the exploitation of labour, political repression and economic inequality. As anarcho-syndicalists, SolFed considers the workplace to be the venue best suited for class conflict and favours the organisation of workers into industrial unions. SolFed&#x27;s preferred tactics include various different direct actions, from strike actions to workplace occupations and sabotage.

SolFed seeks short-term improvements to working conditions, and in the long-term, desires the abolition of the state and capitalism. They ultimately advocate for the establishment of an industrial economy based on workers&#x27; self-management, in which individual needs are prioritised over profit. SolFed considers the general strike to be a means to achieve such a social revolution.

In a break from traditional anarcho-syndicalism, which upholds &quot;strategic centralism&quot;, SolFed argues for a diversity of tactics in order to oppose all forms of oppression and hierarchical power. While agitating against economic oppression, SolFed also proposes the establishment of localised organisations to oppose other forms of oppression, including environmental degradation, sexism, racism and homophobia. SolFed is also opposed to existing institutions of mass media, which it considers to be a mouthpiece for the ruling class, and has called instead for the establishment of independent media.

As a means to achieve workers&#x27; self-management, SolFed historically preferred workplace occupations over strike actions; they believed that in order to deny the managerial class access to the workplace, the workers themselves would be required to have a higher level of solidarity and cohesive self-organisation than any strike action. In his book &quot;Rebel Alliances&quot;, historian Benjamin Franks criticised this argument against strike actions, which he said constituted a &quot;hierarchy of industrial action, which freezes methods according to their predetermined position&quot;.

<doc id="294068" wikidata="Q1482170" url="?curid=294068" title="Police Service of Northern Ireland">
<text>The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI; ; Ulster-Scots: &quot;&quot;), is the police service responsible for law enforcement and the prevention of crime within Northern Ireland.

It is the successor to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) after it was reformed and renamed in 2001 on the recommendation of the Patten Report.

The PSNI is the third largest police service in the United Kingdom in terms of officer numbers (after the Metropolitan Police and Police Scotland) and the second largest in terms of geographic area of responsibility, after Police Scotland. The PSNI is approximately half the size of Garda Síochána in terms of officer numbers.

==Background==
As part of the Good Friday Agreement, there was an agreement to introduce a new police service initially based on the body of constables of the RUC. As part of the reform, an Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland (the Patten Commission) was set up, and the RUC was replaced by the PSNI on 4 November 2001. The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 named the new police service as the Police Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating the Royal Ulster Constabulary); shortened to Police Service of Northern Ireland for operational purposes.

Although the majority of PSNI officers are Ulster Protestants, this dominance is not as pronounced as it was in the RUC because of positive action policies. The RUC was a militarised police force and played a key role in policing the violent conflict known as the Troubles.

Initially, Sinn Féin, which represented about a quarter of Northern Ireland voters at the time, refused to endorse the PSNI until the Patten Commission&#x27;s recommendations were implemented in full. However, as part of the St Andrews Agreement, Sinn Féin announced its full acceptance of the PSNI in January 2007. All major political parties in Northern Ireland now support the PSNI.

==Organisation==
The senior officer in charge of the PSNI is its chief constable. The chief constable is appointed by the Northern Ireland Policing Board, subject to the approval of the Minister of Justice for Northern Ireland. The Chief Constable of Northern Ireland is the third-highest paid police officer in the UK (after the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police). The current chief constable is Jon Boutcher, who was appointed on an interim basis after the resignation of Simon Bryne in September 2023 and successful in being officially confirmed as chief constable on 7 November 2023.

The police area is divided into eight districts, each headed by a chief superintendent. Districts are divided into areas, commanded by a chief inspector; these in turn are divided into sectors, commanded by inspectors. In recent years, under new structural reforms, some chief inspectors command more than one area as the PSNI strives to make savings.

In 2001 the old police divisions and sub-divisions were replaced with 29 district command units (DCUs), broadly coterminous with local council areas. In 2007 the DCUs were replaced by eight districts (&#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;H&#x27;) in anticipation of local government restructuring under the Review of Public Administration. Responsibility for policing and justice was devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 9 March 2010, although direction and control of the PSNI remains under the chief constable.

In addition to the PSNI, there are other agencies which have responsibility for specific parts of Northern Ireland&#x27;s transport infrastructure:
* Belfast Harbour Police
* Belfast International Airport Constabulary

==Jurisdiction==
PSNI officers have full powers of a constable throughout Northern Ireland and the adjacent United Kingdom waters. Other than in mutual aid circumstances they have more limited powers of a constable in the other two legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom—England and Wales, and Scotland. Police staff, although non-warranted members of the service, contribute to both back-office, operational support and front-line services, sometimes operating alongside warranted colleagues.

===Co-operation with Garda Síochána===
The Patten Report recommended that a programme of long-term personnel exchanges should be established between the PSNI and the Garda Síochána, the national police force of Ireland. This recommendation was enacted in 2002 by an Inter-Governmental Agreement on Policing Cooperation, which set the basis for the exchange of officers between the two services. There are three levels of exchanges:
* Personnel exchanges, for all ranks, without policing powers and for a term up to one year
* Secondments: for ranks from sergeant to chief superintendent, with policing powers, for up to three years
* Lateral entry by the permanent transfer of officers for ranks above inspector and under assistant commissioner

The protocols for these movements of personnel were signed by both the Chief Constable of the PSNI and the Garda Commissioner on 21 February 2005.

==Accountability==
The PSNI is supervised by the Northern Ireland Policing Board.

The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland deals with any complaints regarding the PSNI, and investigates any allegations of misconduct by police officers. Police staff do not fall under the ombudsman&#x27;s jurisdiction. The current Police Ombudsman is Marie Anderson, who took over from Michael Maguire in July 2019.

The PSNI is also internally regulated by its Professional Standards Department, who can direct local &quot;professional standards champions&quot; (superintendents at district level) to investigate relatively minor matters, while a &quot;misconduct panel&quot; will consider more serious misconduct issues. Outcomes from misconduct hearings include dismissal, a requirement to resign, reduction in rank, monetary fines and cautions.

==Recruitment==
The PSNI was initially legally obliged to operate an affirmative action policy of recruiting 50% of its trainee officers from a Catholic background and 50% from a non-Catholic background, as recommended by the Patten Report, in order to address the under-representation of Catholics that had existed for many decades in policing; in 2001 the RUC was almost 92% Protestant. Many unionist politicians said the &quot;50:50&quot; policy was unfair, and when the Bill to set up the PSNI was going through Parliament, Minister of State Adam Ingram stated: &quot;Dominic Grieve referred to positive discrimination and we hold our hands up. Clause 43 refers to discrimination and appointments and there is no point in saying that that is anything other than positive discrimination.&quot; However, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission cited international human rights law to show that special measures to secure minority participation were in accordance with human rights standards and did not in law constitute &#x27;discrimination&#x27;.

By February 2011, 29.7% of the 7,200 officers were from a Catholic background, but among the 2,500 police staff (non-warranted members), where the 50:50 rule operated only for larger recruitment drives, the proportion of Catholics was just 18%. The British Government nevertheless proposed to end the 50:50 measure, and provisions for &#x27;lateral entry&#x27; of Catholic officers from other police forces, with effect from the end of March 2011. Following a public consultation the special measures were ended in respect of police officers and police staff in April 2011.

Deloitte conducted recruitment exercises on behalf of the PSNI, and was the dominant firm in the Consensia Partnership which existed from 2001 to 2009.

As of 2017, the PSNI have announced that it will be introducing new schemes to increase the number of Catholics in the force. The PSNI is focusing on tackling the fear factor of joining the service as violent dissident Republicans are discouraging Catholics from joining and continue to attack Catholic officers.

==Policies==
In September 2006 it was confirmed that Assistant Chief Constable Judith Gillespie approved the PSNI policy of using children as informants including in exceptional circumstances to inform on their own family but not their parents. The document added safeguards including having a parent or &quot;appropriate adult&quot; present at meetings between juveniles and their handler. It also stressed a child&#x27;s welfare should be paramount when considering the controversial tactics and required that any risk had been properly explained to them and a risk assessment completed.

==Structure==
As of April 2023, the PSNI is structured with the following departments:
; Crime Department
:* Organised Crime Branch
:* Serious Crime Branch
:* Intelligence Branch
:* Specialist Operations Branch

==Specialist units==
===Armed Response Unit===
Specially-trained Armed Response Unit (ARU) officers support other parts of PSNI when faced with people who are carrying weapons such as knives and firearms.

===Headquarters Mobile Support Unit===
Headquarters Mobile Support Unit (HMSU) is the tactical unit of the PSNI. HMSU officers are trained to Specialist Firearms Officer (SFO) and Counter Terrorist Specialist Firearms Officer (CTSFO) standards. They undergo a 26-week training program including firearms, unarmed combat, roping, driving and photography.

===Tactical Support Group===
Tactical Support Group (TSG) officers provide a range of core and specialist services to district policing teams.

Core TSG functions include public order, counter terrorism and crime reduction, community safety, crime scene response, and surveillance capability.

==Uniform==

The colour of the PSNI uniform is bottle green. Pre-1970s RUC uniforms retained a dark green called rifle green, which was often mistaken as black. A lighter shade of green was introduced following the Hunt Report in the early 1970s, although Hunt recommended that British blue should be introduced. The Patten report, however, recommended the retention of the green uniform (Recommendation No. 154). The RUC officially described this as &#x27;rifle green&#x27;. When the six new versions of the PSNI uniform were introduced, in March 2002, the term &#x27;bottle green&#x27; was used for basically the same colour to convey a less militaristic theme.
In 2018 a formal review was launched about the current uniform after officers gave feedback on it.

On 31 January 2022, a new uniform was introduced for frontline officers. This change replaced the white shirt and tie that was worn since 2001 with a green wicking material t-shirt. This new style shirt is embroidered with the PSNI crest on the left breast and the word Police on the left collar and both sleeves. The new shirt also facilitates the wearing of epaulettes to display rank and numerals. This modern workwear is similar to that of Police Scotland aside from colour and to uniforms of some police services in England and Wales. Officer headwear has remained the same and traditionally consists of peaked caps for males and kepi style hats for females. Baseball style caps are worn by tactical units.

===Badge and flag===
The precise brand colours of the Service Flag and Service Emblem are as follows.

Under the &quot;Police Emblems and Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002&quot; no other flag can be used by the PSNI and it is the only one permitted to be flown on any PSNI building, vehicle, aircraft or vessel.

In November 2001, the British government published proposals for the emblem of the nascent PSNI - some featured the flax flower or St. Patrick&#x27;s Saltire, while others lacked any discernible symbols at all. The proposals were roundly rejected by unionists, with the DUP&#x27;s Ian Paisley Jr branding them &quot;meaningless&quot;. UUP policing board member Lord Kilclooney criticised the government for &quot;pre-empting&quot; the decision of the board - he doubted agreement on a symbol could be reached.

An ad hoc committee of the Policing Board was established to carry out further research into a potential design, comprising six Policing Board members, including three of the Board&#x27;s &#x27;political members&#x27; (i.e. holders of elected political office at that time) and three of its &#x27;independent members&#x27;. The committee comprised Pauline McCabe as Chair (McCabe was a business consultant who would later become Prisoner Ombudsman), the DUP&#x27;s Sammy Wilson, the UUP&#x27;s Fred Cobain, the SDLP&#x27;s Eddie McGrady, former SDLP communications director Tom Kelly, and crossbench hereditary peer Viscount Brookeborough.

This committee reached agreement on the PSNI emblem the following month, which has been used ever since. Notably, the emblem contradicted the Patten recommendations, which called for neutral symbols to be used - instead, a crown, harp and shamrock were all incorporated, thus including symbols to satisfy each side of the community. The Secretary of State accordingly used the powers granted to them the previous year by new legislation, to adopt the new symbol.

The UUP, SDLP and DUP all commended the design they had agreed to - these parties had previously won two-thirds of all seats in the Assembly elections in 1998, and together made up 83% of unionists and 57% of nationalists.

However, reception was tepid among some unionist politicians. While DUP Foyle MLA and Policing Board member William Hay was enthusiastic about the badge, calling it &quot;genuinely representative of both communities&quot;, then-councillor for the DUP, Gregory Campbell, said he was disappointed at the symbol but remakred that &#x27;it could have been a lot worse&#x27;. In the UUP, future MLA Norah Beare condemned the badge as &quot;an insult to the memory of the Royal Ulster Constabulary&quot;, while UUP councillor Ian Burns suggested there was &quot;little on the new badge to symbolise the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland&quot;.

As Sinn Féin did not participate in the Policing Board, they had no input into this process of designing or selecting a logo. The unionist News Letter commented that &quot;the absence of Sinn Fein undoubtedly made the task of reaching a consensus a lot easier for all concerned&quot;.

Also not participating were smaller parties - namely, Alliance (6 MLAs), the Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s Coalition (2 MLAs), the Progressive Unionist Party (2 MLAs), as well as 3 independent unionist MLAs and Robert McCartney, the lone UK Unionist Party MLA (after the other 4 MLAs for the party broke off and became the Northern Ireland Unionist Party in 1999). Together, they represented 18 of the Assembly&#x27;s 108 MLAs - one-sixth. But individually, none of them had enough Assembly seats to be eligible to sit on the Policing Board (the 10 &#x27;political&#x27; seats are filled based on each party&#x27;s strength in the Assembly, via the d&#x27;Hondt method).

As well as refusing to support the PSNI for several years, Sinn Féin specifically criticised the symbol itself. Derry Sinn Féin councillor Paul Fleming called for the PSNI &quot;to adopt a new badge and symbol which were entirely free from any association with either the British or Irish states&quot;. Fleming further described the inclusion of the crown and harp (both of which had been present previously in the RUC&#x27;s badge) as &quot;at odds with Patten&quot;, and criticised the SDLP for &#x27;capitulating&#x27; in the face of &quot;unionist pressure&quot;. Later, the SDLP&#x27;s West Belfast MLA Alex Attwood hit back at the Sinn Féin criticisms, saying &quot;There is no British crown. There is a crown, a common and shared symbol throughout these islands.&quot;

In the 2003 Assembly election, Sinn Féin displaced the SDLP as the majority party of nationalism. While Sinn Féin had no formal input into the design of the emblem, in 2007 their ard fheis voted to support the PSNI, and Sinn Féin has not proposed any change to the emblem - either at that time or since.

Alliance had called for an emblem in line with Patten recommendations, which did not contain specifically British or Irish symbols, but rather neutral symbols, and symbols specific to Northern Ireland, stating:

On the emblem&#x27;s adoption, one Alliance councillor, Frank McQuaid, expressed his like for the symbol, but that he desired &quot;to get on with the job of policing the people&quot; and that &#x27;far too much time had been wasted&#x27; regarding the symbols.

==Equipment==
===Body armour===
PSNI officers wear overt body armour vests featuring RF1 standard ballistic plates, designed to stop high-velocity rifle rounds.

Beginning in December 2007 body armour was required for PSNI officers operating in the Greater Belfast and Greater Derry City areas owing to the threat from dissident republicans.

As of 2020, all officers are issued with ballistic body armour, however in some lower-risk areas officers are permitted, on an optional basis, to wear stab vests, such as those worn by most UK police officers and the Gardaí.

In 2019 the PSNI introduced a new integrated body armour system similar to the Osprey body armour used by the British Army, intended to be lighter and more comfortable to wear.

===Firearms===
Due to the elevated threat posed by armed paramilitary groups, and in contrast to the majority of police services in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, all PSNI officers are routinely armed while on duty, with officers also permitted to carry firearms while off-duty.

Historically, RUC officers were issued with the Ruger Speed-Six revolver and had access to the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine gun and the Heckler &amp; Koch G3 and Heckler &amp; Koch HK33 rifles (which replaced the earlier Sterling submachine guns and Ruger AC-556 select-fire rifles between 1992 and 1995), with the PSNI inheriting these weapons upon formation.

The PSNI&#x27;s standard issue firearm is the Glock 17 pistol, which is carried by every operational officer on the ground. The Glock 17 began superseding the Ruger Speed-Six revolvers from 2002 onwards, with only fifteen revolvers remaining in service by 2012.

The primary long-arm used in the service is the Heckler &amp; Koch G36K carbine, which was procured to supplement and eventually replace the MP5, G3, and HK33.

L104 riot guns are available for crowd control purposes.

Long arms are still routinely carried in areas of higher threat such as Derry, Belfast (particularly north and west), and various border areas.

===Vehicles===
The best known PSNI vehicle is the Land Rover Tangi armoured vehicle, used extensively during the volatile period of the Troubles. In 2011, however, it was announced that some of the aging Tangi fleet were to be replaced in response to officer safety concerns following the 2010 Northern Ireland riots, and as of 2021, only four remained in frontline service. Replacements sourced by the PSNI from 2012 onwards included 176 OVIK PANGOLIN Armoured Public Order Vehicles and 124 Penman Public Order vehicles, both of which are based on the Land Rover Defender chassis.

The PSNI today uses mostly conventional vehicles as part of its fleet of up to 2,690 vehicles for regular patrols across Northern Ireland, most of which consist of marked and unmarked estate cars and SUVs. These can be categorised as either armoured or &quot;soft skin&quot; unarmoured vehicles, with the former receiving armoured panels and bulletproof windows. In November 2020, 50 Škoda Kodiaqs and five Škoda Superbs were supplied to the PSNI as part of a programme to modernise the force&#x27;s fleet; vehicles either currently or previously operated by the PSNI include Škoda Octavias, Vauxhall Vectras, Volkswagen Passats, Ford Mondeos and Audi A6 and A4s, as well as BMW R1200RT motorcycles.

In addition to using cars, vans and motorcycles, the PSNI also have a fleet of 242 bicycles which are used for city centres and walkway patrols.

===Air support===
In 2014 the Air Support Unit responded to over 4,000 callouts, 12 were Casualty evacuations and participated in over 250 missing people searches. All aircraft are used for investigations, anti-crime operations, traffic management, search and rescue, public order situations, crime reduction initiatives and tackling terrorism.

====Helicopters====

In May 2005, the PSNI took delivery of its first helicopter, a Eurocopter EC 135, registration G-PSNI and callsign Police 44. In 2010, the PSNI took delivery of its second aircraft, a Eurocopter EC 145 registration G-PSNO and callsign Police 45 at a cost of £7million. In July 2013, a third helicopter entered service, Eurocopter EC 145, registration G-PSNR and callsign Police 46.

====Fixed wing aircraft====
The PSNI operates two fixed wing aircraft for aerial surveillance. In August 1992, a Britten-Norman BN-2T Islander entered service with registration G-BSWR and callsign Scout 1. In July 2011, the aircraft sustained damage during a crash-landing at Aldergrove. In June 2013, prior to the G8 summit, a Britten-Norman Defender 4000 entered service with registration G-CGTC and callsign Scout 2.

Until 2019 when NPAS purchased four planes, the PSNI was for many years the only UK police service operating fixed-wing aircraft.

===Other items===
Other items of equipment include:
* Folding Hiatt Speedcuffs
* Monadnock 26&quot; friction-lock baton with Hindi cap
* First Aid pouch
* TETRA radio (Motorola MTP3550)
* Torch with traffic wand
* Limb-restraints, also known as fast-straps

The PSNI previously issued BlackBerry devices to officers, which have now been replaced by various models of Android smartphones.

As of 2019 the service began replacing the previously issued CS spray with PAVA spray.

==Headquarters==
The service&#x27;s headquarters are located in Knock, an area in east Belfast, and since the 1980s has included the Service&#x27;s Museum.

== 2023 data breach and ICO fine ==

On 8 August 2023, the PSNI suffered a major data breach when personal information of approximately 9,500 police officers and staff was accidentally published online in response to a freedom of information request. The disclosed data included surnames, initials, ranks, work locations and departments for all PSNI employees.

On 26 September 2024, the UK Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO) issued a monetary penalty notice fining the PSNI £750,000 for infringements of data protection law related to the breach. The ICO found that the PSNI had failed to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data from 25 May 2018 to 14 June 2024, in violation of the UK General Data Protection Regulation.

The ICO noted the sensitive nature of the data given the security situation in Northern Ireland, stating the breach &quot;could lead to the most severe consequences imaginable for officers, staff and their families.&quot; While the ICO initially calculated a £5.6 million fine based on the seriousness of the infringements, this was reduced to £750,000 in line with the ICO&#x27;s revised approach to public sector enforcement.

==Chief constables==
==Ranks==
In the PSNI there are also part-time Special constables known as a Reserve Constable. In contrast to most Special constables elsewhere in the UK, this is a paid position.

The ranks and their insignia correspond to those of other UK police services, with a few modifications: Sergeants&#x27; chevrons are worn point-up as is done in the United States, rather than point-down as is done in other police and military services of the United Kingdom. The six-pointed star &amp; saltire device from the PSNI badge is used in place of the Crown in the insignia of superintendents, chief superintendents and the chief constable.

The rank insignia of the chief constable, unlike those in other parts of the UK, are similar to those of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and the Commissioner of the City of London Police.

==Controversy==
===Officer misconduct===
In 2021 the BBC reported on news of 39 internal investigations into sexual misconduct or domestic abuse by PSNI officers over the past five years.

In January 2023 9 PSNI officers were fired in for sexual misconduct or domestic abuse.

In 2023 the Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service (PPSNI) charged two PSNI officers for taking pictures of dead bodies. This was first reported on in 2022 by the BBC news program Spotlight, after they spoke with family members of a man who committed suicide in 2017. The family of the man was concerned about the behaviour of officers on the scene.

This 2023 disciplinary decision came about as a result of an internal investigation titled &quot;Operation Warwick&quot;, by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. For these charges, one officer was dismissed, and one was suspended.

===2023 data breaches===

The PSNI suffered two data breaches in 2023, in which personal details of thousands of PSNI officers and staff was inadvertedly published on a public website.

Following the 2023 data breaches, a LucidTalk opinion poll revealed that 38% of people in Northern Ireland had &quot;no&quot; or &quot;mostly no&quot; confidence in the PSNI. The poll also found that unionist voters were more likely to have confidence in the police service than nationalists, though support for the PSNI was highest amongst &quot;other&quot; voters.

==Police Fund==
The Fund was set up in 2002 to provide care and financial assistance to police officers and ex-officers who have been injured or disabled from being the direct target of a terrorist attack and to the widows, widowers and families of police officers killed or injured through terrorism.

<doc id="294075" wikidata="Q17254" url="?curid=294075" title="Connect Four">
<text>Connect Four (also known as Connect 4, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain&#x27;s Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one&#x27;s own tokens. It is therefore a type of &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;-game (7, 6, 4) with restricted piece placement. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

The game was created by Howard Wexler, and first sold under the &quot;Connect Four&quot; trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974.
==Gameplay==
A gameplay example (right), shows the first player starting Connect Four by dropping one of their yellow discs into the center column of an empty game board. The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, until the second player, with red discs, achieves a diagonal four in a row, and wins the game. If the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw.

==Mathematical solution==
Connect Four is a two-player game with perfect information for both sides, meaning that nothing is hidden from anyone. Connect Four also belongs to the classification of an adversarial, zero-sum game, since a player&#x27;s advantage is an opponent&#x27;s disadvantage.

One measure of complexity of the Connect Four game is the number of possible games board positions. For classic Connect Four played on a 7-column-wide, 6-row-high grid, there are 4,531,985,219,092 (about 4.5 trillion) positions for all game boards populated with 0 to 42 pieces.
The game was first solved by James Dow Allen (October 1, 1988), and independently by Victor Allis (October 16, 1988). Allis describes a knowledge-based approach, with nine strategies, as a solution for Connect Four. Allen also describes winning strategies in his analysis of the game. At the time of the initial solutions for Connect Four, brute-force analysis was not deemed feasible given the game&#x27;s complexity and the computer technology available at the time.

Connect Four has since been solved with brute-force methods, beginning with John Tromp&#x27;s work in compiling an 8-ply database. The artificial intelligence algorithms able to strongly solve Connect Four are minimax or negamax, with optimizations that include alpha-beta pruning, move ordering, and transposition tables. The code for solving Connect Four with these methods is also the basis for the Fhourstones integer performance benchmark.

The solved conclusion for Connect Four is first-player-win. With perfect play, the first player can force a win, on or before the 41st move by starting in the middle column. The game is a theoretical draw when the first player starts in the columns adjacent to the center. For the edges of the game board, column 1 and 2 on left (or column 7 and 6 on right), the exact move-value score for first player start is loss on the 40th move, and loss on the 42nd move, respectively. In other words, by starting with the four outer columns, the first player allows the second player to force a win.

==Rule variations==
There are many variations of Connect Four with differing game board sizes, game pieces, and gameplay rules. Many variations are popular with game theory and artificial intelligence research, rather than with physical game boards and gameplay by persons.

The most commonly-used Connect Four board size is 7 columns × 6 rows. Size variations include 5×4, 6×5, 8×7, 9×7, 10×7, 8×8, Infinite Connect-Four, and Cylinder-Infinite Connect-Four.

Several versions of Hasbro&#x27;s Connect Four physical gameboard make it easy to remove game pieces from the bottom one at a time. Along with traditional gameplay, this feature allows for variations of the game. Some earlier game versions also included specially-marked discs, and cardboard column extenders, for additional variations to the game.

===PopOut===
&quot;PopOut&quot; starts the same as traditional gameplay, with an empty board and players alternating turns placing their own colored discs into the board. During each turn, a player can either add another disc from the top, or if one has any discs of their own color on the bottom row, remove (or &quot;pop out&quot;) a disc of one&#x27;s own color from the bottom. Popping a disc out from the bottom drops every disc above it down one space, changing their relationship with the rest of the board and changing the possibilities for a connection. The first player to connect four of their discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

===Pop 10===
Before play begins, &quot;Pop 10&quot; is set up differently from the traditional game. Taking turns, each player places one of their own color discs into the slots filling up only the bottom row, then moving on to the next row until it is filled, and so forth until all rows have been filled.

Gameplay works by players taking turns removing a disc of one&#x27;s own color through the bottom of the board. If the disc that was removed was part of a four-disc connection at the time of its removal, the player sets it aside out of play and immediately takes another turn. If it was not part of a &quot;connect four&quot;, then it must be placed back on the board through a slot at the top into any open space in an alternate column (whenever possible) and the turn ends, switching to the other player. The first player to set aside ten discs of their color wins the game.

===Five-in-a-Row===
The &quot;Five-in-a-Row&quot; variation for Connect Four is a game played on a 6 high, 9 wide grid. Two additional board columns, already filled with player pieces in an alternating pattern, are added to the left and right sides of the standard 6-by-7 game board. The game plays similarly to the original Connect Four, except players must now get five pieces in a row to win. This is still a 42-ply game since the two new columns added to the game represent twelve game pieces already played, before the start of a game.

===Power Up===
In this variation of Connect Four, players begin a game with one or more specially-marked &quot;Power Checkers&quot; game pieces, which each player may choose to play once per game. When playing a piece marked with an anvil icon, for example, the player may immediately pop out all pieces below it, leaving the anvil piece at the bottom row of the game board. Other marked game pieces include one with a wall icon, allowing a player to play a second consecutive non-winning turn with an unmarked piece; a &quot;×2&quot; icon, allowing for an unrestricted second turn with an unmarked piece; and a bomb icon, allowing a player to immediately pop out an opponent&#x27;s piece.

==Other versions==

Hasbro also produces various sizes of Giant Connect Four, suitable for outdoor use. The largest is built from weather-resistant wood, and measures 120 cm in both width and height. Connect Four was released for the Microvision video game console in 1979, developed by Robert Hoffberg. It was also released for the Texas Instruments 99/4 computer the same year.

With the proliferation of mobile devices, Connect Four has regained popularity as a game that can be played quickly and against another person over an Internet connection.

In 2007, Milton Bradley published Connect Four Stackers. Instead of the usual grid, the game features a board to place colored discs on. Just like standard Connect Four, the object of the game is to try get four in a row of a specific color of discs.

In 2008, another board variation Hasbro published as a physical game is Connect 4x4. This game features a two-layer vertical grid with colored discs for four players, plus blocking discs. The object of the game is also to get four in a row for a specific color of discs.

In 2013, Bay Tek Games released a Connect Four ticket redemption arcade game under license from Hasbro. There are standard and deluxe versions of the game. Two players move and drop the checkers using buttons. If only one player is playing, the player plays against the computer. Both the player that wins and the player that loses get tickets. The player that wins gets to play a bonus round where a checker is moving and the player needs to press the button at the right time to get the ticket jackpot.

In 2015, Winning Moves published Connect Four Twist &amp; Turn. This game variant features a game tower instead of the flat game grid. The tower has five rings that twist independently. Gameplay is similar to standard Connect Four where players try to get four in a row of their own colored discs. However, with Twist &amp; Turn, players have the choice to twist a ring after they have played a piece. It adds a subtle layer of strategy to the gameplay.

In 2018, Bay Tek Games released their second Connect Four arcade game, Connect 4 Hoops. Players throw basketballs into basketball hoops, and they show up as checkers on the video screen. The game can be played by two players, or by one player against the computer. Both the player that wins and the player that loses get tickets.

In 2018, Hasbro released Connect 4 Shots. This version requires the players to bounce coloured balls into the grid until one player achieves four in a row.

==Popular culture==
*Broadcaster and writer Stuart Maconie—while working at the &quot;NME&quot;—started a rumour that Connect Four was invented by David Bowie, which became an urban myth.
*On The Hub&#x27;s game show &quot;Family Game Night&quot;, there is a game under the name &quot;Connect 4 Basketball&quot; in which teams use colored balls.
*In the video game &quot;A Way Out&quot;, Vincent and Leo can play Connect Four as a minigame.

<text>Steve Di Giorgio (born November 7, 1967) is an American bass guitarist. He is known for his work with numerous heavy metal bands such as Sadus (of which he was a co-founder), Death, Testament, Megadeth, Sebastian Bach, Iced Earth, Autopsy, Obituary, Control Denied, Dragonlord and Charred Walls of the Damned, and he has performed on over 50 albums as a guest, session or full-time band musician.

== Career ==
Di Giorgio has played bass guitar in heavy metal and death metal bands such as Death, Autopsy, Control Denied, Ephel Duath, Obscura, Artension, Faust, Memorain, Painmuseum, Suicide Shift, Soen, Vintersorg, Dragonlord, Iced Earth, Sebastian Bach, Obituary, Megadeth, and is a founding member of Sadus. He is a founding member of the jazz band Dark Hall and has played bass in other bands such as Testament, Futures End, Synesis Absorption, Mythodea, Charred Walls of the Damned, Anatomy of I, Gone in April, and Spirits of Fire. Along with his bass duties in Sadus, he also plays keyboards. In October 2019, he founded the fusion-world-metal group Quadvium with fellow fretless bass player Jeroen Paul Thesseling. A year later, he formed the death metal supergroup Act of Denial.

==Musical style and influences==

Within his genre, Di Giorgio is respected for his highly technical playing skills. He is also credited with being the first bassist to bring fretless bass playing into the heavy/extreme metal genre, and often plays bass by using his fingers, although he has been seen using a pick on certain songs. Di Giorgio has stated that his main influences as a bassist are Geddy Lee, Chris Squire, Geezer Butler, Steve Harris, Stanley Clarke, Jaco Pastorius, Billy Sheehan, Dave Pegg and Charles Meeks.

== Personal life ==
Di Giorgio has been married for years, and is the father of a daughter who was born in April 1994. The family currently resides in Antioch, California.

== Equipment ==
Di Giorgio endorses Ibanez Guitars and primarily plays a number of different fretted and fretless BTB basses. He previously played two custom Mjolnir basses by Thor Bass; a custom made 5-string fretless model which he has converted to a 3-string and a custom-built 6 string fretless. He&#x27;s also played custom ESP basses, mostly a F-series fretless 5-string bass in a dark green finish, but also uses a very unusual double-neck construction with a fretted and a fretless neck in one body. He currently uses an EBS Fafner head as his main sound, but has also used Ampeg and Randall in the past.

<text>A Tale of a Tub was the first major work written by Jonathan Swift, composed between 1694 and 1697 and published in 1704. The &quot;Tale&quot; is a prose parody divided into sections of &quot;digression&quot; and a &quot;tale&quot; of three brothers, each representing one of the main branches of western Christianity from the 17th-century English perspective. A satire on the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches and English Dissenters, it was famously attacked for its profanity and irreligion, starting with William Wotton, who wrote that it made a game of &quot;God and Religion, Truth and Moral Honesty, Learning and Industry&quot; to show &quot;at the bottom [the author&#x27;s] contemptible Opinion of every Thing which is called Christianity.&quot; The work continued to be regarded as an attack on religion well into the nineteenth century. One commentator complained that Swift must be &quot;a compulsive cruiser of Dunghils … Ditches, and Common-Shores with a great Affectation [sic] for every thing that is nasty. When he spies any Objects that another Person would avoid looking on, that he Embraces&quot;.

The &quot;Tale&quot; was enormously popular, presenting both a satire of religious excess and a parody of contemporary writing in literature, politics, theology, Biblical exegesis, and medicine through its comically excessive front matter and series of digressions throughout. The overarching parody is of enthusiasm, pride, and credulity. At the time it was written, politics and religion were still closely linked in England, and the religious and political aspects of the satire can often hardly be separated. &quot;The work made Swift notorious, and was widely misunderstood, especially by Queen Anne herself who mistook its purpose for profanity.&quot; It &quot;effectively disbarred its author from proper preferment&quot; in the Church of England.

==The tale==

===Overview===
&quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; comprises the tale itself, an allegory of the Reformation in the story of brothers Peter, Martin, and Jack as they attempt to make their way in the world, along with various digressions interspersed throughout. Each brother represents one of the primary branches of Christianity in the West. This part of the book is a pun on &quot;tub&quot;, which Alexander Pope says was a common term for a Dissenter&#x27;s pulpit, and a reference to Swift&#x27;s own position as a clergyman. Peter (named for Saint Peter) stands in for the Roman Catholic Church. Jack (named for John Calvin, but whom Swift also connects to John of Leiden) represents the various dissenting Protestant churches such as Baptists, Presbyterians, Quakers, Congregationalists and Anabaptists. The third brother, middle born and middle standing, is Martin (named for Martin Luther), whom Swift uses to represent the &#x27;via media&#x27; of the Church of England. The brothers have inherited three wonderfully satisfactory coats (representing religious practice) by their father (representing God), and they have his will (representing the Bible) to guide them. Although the will says that the brothers are forbidden from making any changes to their coats, they do nearly nothing but alter their coats from the start. In as much as the will represents the Bible and the coat represents the practice of Christianity, the allegory of the narrative is supposed to be an apology for the Anglican church&#x27;s refusal to alter its practice in accordance with Puritan demands and its continued resistance to ally with the Roman church.

From its opening (once past the prolegomena, which comprises the first three sections), the book alternates between Digression and Tale. However, the digressions overwhelm the narrative, both in their length and in the forcefulness and imaginativeness of writing. Furthermore, after Chapter X (the commonly anthologised &quot;Digression on Madness&quot;), the labels for the sections are incorrect. Sections then called &quot;Tale&quot; are Digressions, and those called &quot;Digression&quot; are also Digressions.

&quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; is an enormous parody with a number of smaller parodies within it. Many critics have followed Swift&#x27;s biographer Irvin Ehrenpreis in arguing that there is no single, consistent narrator in the work. One difficulty with this position, however, is that if there is no single character posing as the author, then it is at least clear that nearly all of the &quot;personae&quot; employed by Swift for the parodies are so much alike that they function as a single identity. In general, whether a modern reader would view the book as consisting of dozens of impersonations or a single one, Swift writes the &quot;Tale&quot; through the pose of a Modern or New Man. See the abridged discussion of the &quot;Ancients and Moderns&quot;, below, for more on the nature of the &quot;modern man&quot; in Swift&#x27;s day.

Swift&#x27;s explanation for the title of the book is that the Ship of State was threatened by a whale (specifically, the &quot;Leviathan&quot; of Thomas Hobbes) and the new political societies (the Rota Club is mentioned). His book is intended to be a tub that the sailors of state (the nobles and ministers) might toss over the side to divert the attention of the beast (those who questioned the government and its right to rule). Hobbes was highly controversial in the Restoration, but Swift&#x27;s invocation of Hobbes might well be ironic. The narrative of the brothers is a faulty allegory, and Swift&#x27;s narrator is either a madman or a fool. The book is not one that could occupy the &quot;Leviathan,&quot; or preserve the Ship of State, so Swift may be intensifying the dangers of Hobbes&#x27;s critique rather than allaying them to provoke a more rational response.

The digressions individually frustrate readers who expect a clear purpose. Each digression has its own topic, and each is an essay on its particular sidelight. In his biography of Swift, Ehrenpreis argued that each digression is an impersonation of a different contemporary author. This is the &quot;persona theory,&quot; which holds that the &quot;Tale&quot; is not one parody, but rather a series of parodies, arising out of chamber performance in the Temple household. Prior to Ehrenpreis, some critics had argued that the narrator of the &quot;Tale&quot; is a character, just as the narrator of a novel would be. Given the evidence of A. C. Elias about the acrimony of Swift&#x27;s departure from the Temple household, evidence from Swift&#x27;s &quot;Journal to Stella&quot; about how uninvolved in the Temple household Swift had been, and the number of repeated observations about himself by the &quot;Tale&#x27;s&quot; author, it seems reasonable to propose that the digressions reflect a single &quot;type&quot; of man, if not a particular character.

In any case, the digressions are each readerly tests; each tests whether or not the reader is intelligent and sceptical enough to detect nonsense. Some, such as the discussion of ears or of wisdom being like a nut, a cream sherry, a cackling hen, etc., are outlandish and require a militantly aware and thoughtful reader. Each is a trick, and together they train the reader to sniff out bunk and to reject the unacceptable.

===Cultural setting===
During the Restoration the print revolution began to change every aspect of British society. It became possible for anyone to spend a small amount of money and have his or her opinions published as a broadsheet, and to gain access to the latest discoveries in science, literature, and political theory, as books became less expensive and digests and &quot;indexes&quot; of the sciences grew more numerous. The difficulty lay in discerning truth from falsehood, credible claims from impossible one. Swift writes &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; in the guise of a narrator who is excited and gullible about what the new world has to offer, and feels that he is quite the equal or superior of any author who ever lived because he, unlike them, possesses &#x27;technology&#x27; and newer opinions. Swift seemingly asks the question of what a person with no discernment but with a thirst for knowledge would be like, and the answer is the narrator of &quot;Tale of a Tub.&quot;

Swift was annoyed by people so eager to possess the newest knowledge that they failed to pose sceptical questions. If he was not a particular fan of the aristocracy, he was a sincere opponent of democracy, which was often viewed then as the sort of &quot;mob rule&quot; that led to the worst abuses of the English Interregnum. Swift&#x27;s satire was intended to provide a genuine service by painting the portrait of conspiracy minded and injudicious writers.

At that time in England, politics, religion and education were unified in a way that they are not now. The monarch was the head of the state church. Each school (secondary and university) had a political tradition. Officially, there was no such thing as &quot;Whig and Tory&quot; at the time, but the labels are useful and were certainly employed by writers themselves. The two major parties were associated with religious and economic groups. The implications of this unification of politics, class, and religion are important. Although it is somewhat extreme and simplistic to put it this way, failing to be for the Church was failing to be for the monarch; having an interest in physics and trade was to be associated with dissenting religion and the Whig Party. When Swift attacks the lovers of all things modern, he is thereby attacking the new world of trade, of dissenting religious believers, and, to some degree, an emergent portion of the Whig Party.

===Authorial background===
Born of English parents in Ireland, Jonathan Swift was working as Sir William Temple&#x27;s secretary at the time he composed &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; (1694–1697). The publication of the work coincided with Swift&#x27;s striking out on his own, having despaired of getting a good &quot;living&quot; from Temple or Temple&#x27;s influence. There is speculation about what caused the rift between Swift and his employer, but, as A. C. Elias persuasively argues, it seems that the final straw came with Swift&#x27;s work on Temple&#x27;s &quot;Letters.&quot; Swift had been engaged to translate Temple&#x27;s French correspondence, but Temple, or someone close to Temple, edited the French text to make Temple seem both prescient and more fluent. Consequently, the letters and the translations Swift provided did not gibe, and, since Swift could not accuse Temple of falsifying his letters, and because the public would never believe that the retired state minister had lied, Swift came across as incompetent.
Even though Swift published the &quot;Tale&quot; as he left Temple&#x27;s service, it was conceived earlier, and the book is a salvo in one of Temple&#x27;s battles. Swift&#x27;s general polemic concerns an argument (the &quot;Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns&quot;) that had been over for nearly ten years by the time the book was published. The &quot;Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns&quot; was a French academic debate of the early 1690s, occasioned by Fontenelle arguing that modern scholarship had allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge. Temple argued against this position in his &quot;On Ancient and Modern Learning&quot; (where he provided the first English formulation of the commonplace that modern critics see more only because they are dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants), and Temple&#x27;s somewhat naive essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were Richard Bentley (classicist and editor) and William Wotton (critic).

The entire discussion in England was over by 1696, and yet it seems to have fired Swift&#x27;s imagination. Swift saw in the opposing camps of Ancients and Moderns a shorthand of two general ways of looking at the world (see the historical background, below, for some of the senses in which &quot;new men&quot; and &quot;ancients&quot; might be understood). The &quot;Tale of a Tub&quot; attacks all who praise modernity over classical learning. Temple had done as much, but Swift, unlike Temple, has no praise for the classical world, either. There is no normative value in Rome, no lost English glen, no hearth ember to be invoked against the hubris of modern scientism. Some critics have seen in Swift&#x27;s reluctance to praise mankind in any age proof of his misanthropy, and others have detected in it an overarching hatred of pride. At the same time, the &quot;Tale&quot; revived the Quarrel of Ancients and Moderns at least enough to prompt Wotton to come out with a new edition of his pamphlet attacking Temple, and he appended to it an essay against the author of &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot;. Swift was able to cut pieces from Wotton&#x27;s &quot;Answer&quot; to include in the fifth edition of the &quot;Tale&quot; as &quot;Notes&quot; at the bottom of the page. Swift&#x27;s satire also gave something of a framework for other satirists in the Scriblerian circle, and Modern vs. Ancient is picked up as one distinction between political and cultural forces.

If Swift hoped that the &quot;Tale of a Tub&quot; would win him a living, he would have been disappointed. Swift himself believed that the book cost him any chance of high position within the church. It is most likely, though, that Swift was not seeking a clerical position with the &quot;Tale.&quot; Instead, it was probably meant to establish him as a literary and political figure and to strike out a set of positions that would win the notice of influential men. This it did. As a consequence of this work, and his activity in Church causes, Swift became a familiar of Robert Harley, future Earl of Oxford, and Henry St. John, the future Viscount Bolingbroke. When the Tories gained the government in 1710, Swift was rewarded for his work. By 1713–14, however, the Tory government had fallen, and Swift was made Dean of Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin—an appointment he considered an exile.

===Nature of the satire===

Upon publication the public realised both that there was an allegory in the story of the brothers and that there were particular political references in the Digressions. A number of &quot;Keys&quot; appeared soon thereafter, analogous to contemporary services like CliffsNotes or Spark Notes. &quot;Keys&quot; offered the reader a commentary on the &quot;Tale&quot; and explanations of its references. Edmund Curll rushed out a &quot;Key&quot; to the work, and William Wotton offered up an &quot;Answer&quot; to the author of the work.

Swift&#x27;s targets included indexers, note-makers, and, above all, people who saw &quot;dark matter&quot; in books. Attacking criticism generally, he appears delighted that one of his enemies, William Wotton, offered to explain the &quot;Tale&quot; in an &quot;answer&quot; to the book and that one of the men he had explicitly attacked, Curll, offered to explain the book to the public. In the fifth edition of the book in 1710, Swift provided an apparatus to the work that incorporated Wotton&#x27;s explanations and Swift&#x27;s narrator&#x27;s notes. The notes appear to occasionally provide genuine information and just as often to mislead, and William Wotton&#x27;s name, a defender of the Moderns, was appended to a number of notes. This allows Swift to make the commentary part of the satire itself, as well as to elevate his narrator to the level of self-critic.

The &quot;Tale&#x27;s&quot; satire is most consistent in attacking misreading of all sorts. Both in the narrative sections and the digressions, the single human flaw that underlies all the follies Swift attacks is over-figurative and over-literal reading, both of the Bible and of poetry and political prose. The narrator is seeking hidden knowledge, mechanical operations of things spiritual, spiritual qualities to things physical, and alternate readings of everything.

Within the &quot;tale&quot; sections of the book, Peter, Martin, and Jack fall into bad company (becoming the official religion of the Roman empire) and begin altering their coats (faith) by adding ornaments. They then begin relying on Peter to be the arbitrator of the will. He begins to rule by authority (he remembered the handyman saying that he once heard the father say that it was acceptable to don more ornaments), until such a time that Jack rebels against the rule of Peter. Jack begins to read the will (the Bible) overly literally. He rips the coat to shreds to restore the original state of the garment which represents the &quot;primitive Christianity&quot; sought by dissenters. He begins to rely only upon &quot;inner illumination&quot; for guidance and thus walks around with his eyes closed, after swallowing candle snuffs. Eventually, Peter and Jack begin to resemble one another, and only Martin is left with a coat that is at all like the original.

An important factor in the reception of Swift&#x27;s work is that the narrator of the work is an extremist in every direction. Consequently, he can no more construct a sound allegory than he can finish his digressions without losing control (eventually confessing that he is insane). For a Church of England reader, the allegory of the brothers provides small comfort. Martin has a corrupted faith, one full of holes and still with ornaments on it. His only virtue is that he avoids the excesses of his brothers, but the original faith is lost to him. Readers of the &quot;Tale&quot; have picked up on this unsatisfactory resolution to both &quot;parts&quot; of the book, and &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; has often been offered up as evidence of Swift&#x27;s misanthropy.

As has recently been argued by Michael McKeon, Swift might best be described as a severe sceptic, rather than a Whig, Tory, empiricist, or religious writer. He supported the Classics in the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, and he supported the established church and the aristocracy, because he felt the alternatives were worse. He argued elsewhere that there is nothing inherently virtuous about a noble birth, but its advantages of wealth and education made the aristocrat a better ruler than the equally virtuous but unprivileged commoner. &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; is a perfect example of Swift&#x27;s devastating intellect at work. By its end, little seems worth believing in.

Formally, the satire in the &quot;Tale&quot; is historically novel for several reasons. First, Swift more or less invented prose parody. In the &quot;Apology for the &amp;c.&quot; (added in 1710), Swift explains that his work is, in several places, a &quot;parody,&quot; which is where he imitates the style of persons he wishes to expose. What is interesting is that the word &quot;parody&quot; had not been used for prose before, and the definition he offers is arguably a parody of John Dryden defining &quot;parody&quot; in the Discourse of Satire (the Preface to Dryden&#x27;s translations of Juvenal&#x27;s and Persius&#x27; satires). Prior to Swift, parodies were imitations designed to bring mirth, but not primarily in the form of mockery. Dryden imitated the Aeneid in &quot;MacFlecknoe&quot; to describe the apotheosis of a dull poet, but the imitation made fun of the poet, not Virgil.

Swift&#x27;s satire offers no resolutions. While he ridicules any number of foolish habits, he never offers the reader a positive set of values to embrace. While this type of satire became more common as people imitated Swift, later, Swift is quite unusual in offering the readers no way out. He does not persuade &quot;to&quot; any position, but he does persuade readers &quot;from&quot; an assortment of positions. This is one of the qualities that has made the &quot;Tale&quot; Swift&#x27;s least-read major work.

===Historical background===
In the historical background to the period of 1696–1705, the most important political events might be the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the Test Act, and the English Settlement or Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689. Politically, the English had suffered a Civil War that had culminated with the beheading of the king, years of the Interregnum under the Puritan, Oliver Cromwell, and then Parliament inviting the king back to rule in 1660. Upon Charles II&#x27;s death, his brother, James II of England took the throne. However, when James, a Roman Catholic, married a Roman Catholic as his second wife, the English parliament invited William of Orange to rule in his stead, forcing James to flee the country under military threat. Parliament decided on the way in which all future English monarchs would be chosen. This method would always favour Protestantism over blood line.
For politically aware Englishmen, Parliament had essentially elected a king. Although officially he was supreme, there could be no doubt that the Commons had picked the king and could pick another instead. Although there was now a law demanding that all swear allegiance to the monarch as head of the church, it became less and less clear why the nation was to be so intolerant.

Religious conflict at the time was primarily between the Church of England and the dissenting churches. The threat posed by the dissenters was keenly felt by Establishment clerics like Jonathan Swift. It was common enough for Puritans and other dissenters to disrupt church services, to accuse political leaders of being the anti-Christ, and to move the people toward violent schism, riots, and peculiar behaviour including attempts to set up miniature theocracies. Protestant dissenters had led the English Civil War. The pressure of dissenters was felt on all levels of British politics and could be seen in the change of the British economy.

The Industrial Revolution was beginning in the period between the writing and publication of &quot;A Tale of a Tub,&quot; though no one at the time would have known this. What Englishmen did know, however, was that what they called &quot;trade&quot; was on the rise. Merchants, importers/exporters, and &quot;stock jobbers&quot; were growing very wealthy. It was becoming more common to find members of the aristocracy with less money than members of the trading class. Those on the rise in the middle class professions were perceived as being more likely to be dissenters than members of the other classes were, and such institutions as the stock exchange and Lloyd&#x27;s of London were founded by Puritan traders. Members of these classes were also widely ridiculed as attempting to pretend to learning and manners that they had no right to. Further, these &quot;new men&quot; were not, by and large, the product of the universities nor the traditional secondary schools. Consequently, these now wealthy individuals were not conversant in Latin, were not enamored of the classics, and were not inclined to put much value on these things.

Between 1688 and 1705, England was politically unstable. The accession of Queen Anne led to a feeling of vulnerability among Establishment figures. Anne was rumoured to be immoderately stupid and was supposedly governed by her friend, Sarah Churchill, wife of the Duke of Marlborough. Although Swift was a Whig for much of this period, he was allied most nearly with the Ancients camp (which is to say Establishment, Church of England, aristocracy, traditional education), and he was politically active in the service of the Church. He claims, both in &quot;The Apology for the &amp;c.&quot; and in a reference in Book I of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels,&quot; to have written the &quot;Tale&quot; to defend the crown from the troubles of the monsters besetting it. These monsters were numerous. At this time, political clubs and societies were proliferating. The print revolution had meant that people were gathering under dozens of banners, and political and religious sentiments previously unspoken were now rallying supporters. As the general dissenting position became the monied position, and as Parliament increasingly held power, historically novel degrees of freedom had brought an historically tenuous equipoise of change and stability.

==Publication history==
The &quot;Tale&quot; was originally published in 1704 by John Nutt. Swift had used Benjamin Tooke previously when publishing for Sir William Temple. He would use Tooke for both the fifth edition of the &quot;Tale&quot; (1710) and later works. Tooke&#x27;s successor, Benjamin Motte, published Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. This difference in printer is only one of the things that led to debate over authorship of the work. The first, second and third editions of the &quot;Tale&quot; appeared in 1704; with the fifth edition following in 1710. In &quot;The Apology for the &amp;c.&quot;, Swift indicates that he originally gave his publisher a preliminary copy of the work, while he kept a blotted copy at his own hand and lent other copies including one to Thomas Swift, Jonathan&#x27;s &quot;parson cousin&quot;. As a consequence, the first edition appeared with many errors. The second edition was a resetting of the type. The third edition was a reprint of the second, with corrections, and the fourth edition contained corrections of the third.

The first substantially new edition of the work is the fifth edition of 1710. This is largely the text modern editors will use. It was in this edition that the Notes and the &quot;Apology for the &amp;c.&quot; (&quot;&amp;c.&quot; was Swift&#x27;s shorthand for &quot;Tale of a Tub&quot;: Nutt was supposed to expand the abbreviation out to the book&#x27;s title but did not do so; the mistake was left) were added, which many contemporary readers and authors found a heating up of an already savage satire.

==Authorship debate==
Although today very little of this debate remains, questions of the authorship of the &quot;Tale&quot; occupied many notable critics both in the 18th and 19th centuries. Famously, Samuel Johnson said &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; was a work of true genius (in contrast to &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; where once one imagines &quot;big people and little people&quot; the rest is easy) and too good to be Swift&#x27;s. In the 19th century, many critics who saw misanthropy and madness in Swift&#x27;s later work wished to reject the &quot;Tale&quot; as his. In a way, a critic&#x27;s view on who wrote the &quot;Tale&quot; reflected that critic&#x27;s politics. Swift was such a powerful champion of Tory, or anti-Whig, causes that fans of the &quot;Tale&quot; were eager to attribute the book to another author from nearly the day of its publication.

The work appeared anonymously in 1704. It was Swift&#x27;s habit to publish anonymously throughout his career, partially as a way of protecting his career, and partially his person. As a struggling churchman, Swift needed the support of nobles to gain a living. Additionally, nobles were still responsible for Church affairs in the House of Lords, so his political effectiveness in church affairs depended upon the lords. Swift needed to be at some distance from the sometimes bawdy and scatological work that he wrote.

The &quot;Tale&quot; was immediately popular and controversial. Consequently, there were rumours of various people as the author of the work—Jonathan Swift then being not largely known except for his work in the House of Lords for the passage of the &quot;First Fruits and Fifths&quot; bill for tithing. Some people thought that William Temple wrote it. Francis Atterbury said people at Oxford thought it had been written by Edmund Smith and John Philips, though he thought it was by Jonathan Swift. Some people thought it belonged to Lord Somers. However, Jonathan Swift had a cousin, also in the church, named Thomas Swift. Thomas and Jonathan were in correspondence during the time of the composition of the &quot;Tale,&quot; and Thomas Swift later claimed to have written the work. Jonathan responded by saying that Thomas had no hand in anything but the smallest of passages, and he would welcome hearing Thomas &#x27;explain&#x27; the work, if he had written it. The controversy over authorship is aggravated by the choice of publisher. Not only did Swift use Tooke after the publication of the &quot;Tale,&quot; he had used Tooke before its publication as well, so the appearance of the work in John Nutt&#x27;s shop was atypical.

Stylistically and in sentiment, the &quot;Tale&quot; is undeniably Swift&#x27;s. Most important in this regard is the narrative pose and the creation of narrative parody. The dramatic pretense of writing as a character is in keeping with Jonathan Swift&#x27;s lifelong practice. Furthermore, Thomas Swift has left few literary remains. Thomas Swift&#x27;s authorship is examined in the summary of A. C. Guthkelch and D. Nichol Smith&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; (1920 and 1958), where they say, &quot;all the evidence for Thomas Swift&#x27;s participation in the &quot;Tale&quot;... [is] nothing but rumour and [Edmund] Curll&#x27;s &quot;Key&quot;.&quot; Indeed, in 1710 Swift had the fifth edition republished by Tooke, and he explained in a letter how the rumour had been started. He said that, when the publication initially took place, Swift was abroad in Ireland and &quot;that little Parson-cousin of mine&quot; &quot;affected to talk suspiciously, as if he had some share in it.&quot; In other words, anonymity conspired with Thomas Swift&#x27;s desire for fame to create the confusion. Afterward, only critical preference seems to account for anyone holding Thomas Swift the author.

Robert Hendrickson notes in his book &quot;British Literary Anecdotes&quot; that &quot;Swift was always partial to his strikingly original &quot;The Tale of a Tub&quot; (1704). On reading the work again in later years, he exclaimed &#x27;Good God! What a genius I had when I wrote that book!&#x27;&quot;

<text>Graham Leslie Coxon (born 12 March 1969) is an English guitarist, singer and songwriter who came to prominence as a founding member of the rock band Blur. As the group&#x27;s lead guitarist and secondary vocalist, Coxon is featured on all of Blur&#x27;s studio discography (although 2003&#x27;s &quot;Think Tank&quot; only features his playing on one album track, plus two B-side tracks, due to his temporary departure from the band during recording sessions for the album). He has also led a solo career since 1998, producing and playing all instrumentation on his solo albums. As well as being a musician, Coxon is a visual artist: he designed the cover art for all his solo albums as well as Blur&#x27;s &quot;13&quot; (1999).

Coxon plays several instruments and records his albums with little assistance from session musicians. &quot;Q&quot; magazine critic Adrian Deevoy has written: &quot;Coxon is an astonishing musician. His restless playing style – all chord slides, rapid pulloffs, mini-arpeggios and fractured runs – seems to owe more to his saxophone training than any conventional guitar tuition.&quot; An innovative lead guitarist, he has been described by Oasis bandmember Noel Gallagher as &quot;one of the most talented guitarists of his generation.&quot; Coxon was voted the 15th greatest guitarist of the last 30 years in a 2010 BBC poll.

==Early life==
Coxon was born on 12 March 1969 in Rinteln, West Germany, where his father, Bob Coxon, was stationed as a clarinet player and band leader in the British Army. As a child, he moved first to Spondon, Derby, England, a period during which he became a fan of Derby County. He then moved to Colchester, Essex, England, where he grew up and met fellow Blur member Damon Albarn at The Stanway School, then known as Stanway Comprehensive, at the age of 11. At the beginning of their relationship, Coxon would play the saxophone on Albarn&#x27;s original songs before playing the guitar in several small Colchester bands. He appeared on the popular BBC children&#x27;s show &quot;Blue Peter&quot; twice.

==Music career==

===Blur ===
Coxon studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College, London, for two years, where early on he met bassist Alex James. In his time there he mixed with upcoming talents such as Damien Hirst, Michael Landy, Sam Taylor-Wood, and Abigail Lane, some of the future leading lights of the Britart movement. His musical interests were heavily influenced by Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett, whose work he had discovered by 1986.

He quit college due to the increasing success of his band at the time, Seymour, which later changed its name to Blur because the recording company, Food Records, thought Seymour was too &#x27;student-ish&#x27;. They presented a list to the band of preferred names which included &quot;The Shining Path&quot; and &quot;Blur&quot;. As well as providing all guitars, backing vocals, and occasional drums, Coxon&#x27;s lo-fi and alternative musical style and tastes influenced the band&#x27;s less commercial music in the late 1990s. He sang lead vocals on songs including &quot;Red Necks&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re So Great&quot; from the album &quot;Blur&quot;, and &quot;Coffee &amp; TV&quot;, as well as a section of the chorus of &quot;Tender&quot;, the bridge of &quot;Lonesome Street&quot; and a section of &quot;Thought I Was a Spaceman&quot; on &quot;The Magic Whip&quot;.

During the 1995 period of the media-dubbed &#x27;Battle of Britpop&#x27;, Coxon became increasingly weary and suspicious of the music industry. His behaviour was occasionally awkward, such as refusing to appear in the video for Blur song &quot;Country House&quot; unless he could dress as a milkman and take no part in any action with which he felt uncomfortable.

In November 2001, Coxon was admitted to the Priory Hospital for 28 days to be treated for alcoholism. During this time, Blur began the recording sessions that would produce the material for their next album, &quot;Think Tank&quot;. In February 2002, Coxon rejoined the band in the studio for the rest of the recording of &quot;Think Tank&quot; but after five days was asked by then manager Chris Morrison not to go back into the studio as the other members of the band had reported that the session was not going too well with him present. Coxon took this as a sign and left the band. As he stated in an interview in 2006, &quot;I had a breakthrough, I think my life just became calmer, I gave up drinking. My priorities changed as I had a young daughter. The group didn&#x27;t want me to record for the &quot;Think Tank&quot; album, so I took it as a sign to leave&quot;. His last contribution to Blur was a song called &quot;Battery in Your Leg&quot;, the closing song on Blur&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Think Tank&quot;, before leaving the line-up. Damon Albarn later revealed that the song &quot;Sweet Song&quot; was written after he had been looking at a photograph of Coxon.

After Damon Albarn&#x27;s revealing that he and Coxon had rebuilt their relationship, on 9 December 2008, Blur announced that the whole band would reunite for a show at Hyde Park on 3 July 2009. More dates were announced and the band played festival dates at Glastonbury, T in the Park and Oxegen 2009 as well as headlining shows in Manchester, Newcastle, Wolverhampton, Goldsmiths College and the East Anglian Railway Museum in Colchester. Blur also played one show in Lyon, France.

On 17 April 2010, the band released their first single since 2003, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Day&quot;, for the Record Store Day event as a 7&quot; limited to 1000 copies. The band released the single as a free download on their official website the next day. More recently Blur announced via the NME website that they would reunite every so often and record more singles, preferably on 7 inch. However, Damon also stated that an album was not on its way as they were all too busy with their own individual projects.

On 19 February 2015, Coxon and the band announced on social media that they would be releasing their eighth studio album on 27 April, titled &quot;The Magic Whip&quot;, Blur&#x27;s first album in 12 years and first in 16 years in their original lineup.

After 8 years, the band released their ninth studio album, &quot;The Ballad of Darren&quot;. The band went on an international tour, during which they performed in various festivals, including Coachella, and two sold out concerts at Wembley Arena. On 19th July 2024 the band released a documentary about their latest reunion and tour, &quot;blur: To The End&quot;.

===Solo work ===

Coxon had already released three solo albums while a member of Blur before his 2002 departure. His first, &quot;The Sky Is Too High&quot; was released on his own Transcopic label in 1998. This was followed by &quot;The Golden D&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Crow Sit on Blood Tree&quot; in 2001. After going solo full-time, he released &quot;The Kiss of Morning&quot; in 2002. The album was promoted with the single &quot;Escape Song&quot;. In 2004, Coxon released his fifth solo album &quot;Happiness in Magazines&quot;, produced by ex-Blur and The Smiths producer Stephen Street. This proved to be his most successful album to date, and he received the NME Award for Best Solo Artist in 2005. 

In March 2006 he released his sixth solo album, called &quot;Love Travels at Illegal Speeds&quot;, again produced by Stephen Street. It marked Coxon&#x27;s first album away from his now-defunct indie label &#x27;Transcopic&#x27;. The LP was preceded by the singles &quot;Standing on My Own Again&quot; on 27 February and &quot;You &amp; I&quot;. Coxon embarked on a tour of the UK, starting at Newcastle University. He was also involved in a single supporting the England national football team at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The song was a re-working of the Sham 69 hit &quot;Hurry Up Harry&quot;, and was released as &quot;Sham 69 and The Special Assembly&quot; (as well as Coxon and Sham 69, Virgin Radio DJ Christian O&#x27;Connell, who had run a competition on his show to find a band to record a song in support of the team, was involved in the recording of the song). &quot;Hurry Up England&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 10.

In October 2006, Coxon released a double live album &quot;Burnt to Bitz: At the Astoria&quot; immediately after his sold-out London Astoria show. The album features 27 songs, with at least one song from each of his albums. In July 2007 Coxon released a single with Paul Weller, called &quot;This Old Town&quot;. The single peaked at No. 39 in the UK Singles Chart.

Coxon&#x27;s seventh 15-track studio album titled &quot;The Spinning Top&quot;, produced again by Stephen Street, was released on 11 May 2009. Coxon stated that the LP, which is primarily acoustic, followed a narrative – the story of a man from birth to death. &quot;The album is mainly an acoustic journey although there is, of course, some explosive electric guitar action,&quot; he explained. &quot;There are some guests too! Robyn Hitchcock supplies some counter-attack guitar, Jas Singh plays dilruba and jori with his friends Gurjit Sembhi on taus and Jaskase Singh on esraj. Danny Thompson plays the legendary Victoria, Graham Fox gives plenty of swing on the drums and sizzle cymbals and Louis Vause tinkles the ivories.&quot; Pre-release response had been positive, with Monday Field of &quot;Frank Booth Review&quot; dubbing the album &quot;a staggering artistic achievement, and Coxon&#x27;s best solo release to date.&quot;

His eighth solo album &quot;A+E&quot; was released in April 2012.

Coxon wrote and recorded the score for the 2017 Channel 4 / Netflix television series &quot;The End of the F***ing World&quot;; it was his first original score. The soundtrack was released in January 2018. In September of the same year, Coxon embarked on a solo tour in North America that featured some of the songs from his score.

In February 2020, Coxon released an album for the fictional band Bloodwitch, to be a part of the soundtrack of the Netflix series I Am Not Okay with This, featuring singer Tatyana Richaud.

In 2021, Coxon published &quot;Superstate&quot;, a graphic novel accompanied by a studio album of the same name, bringing the concept of a dystopian futuristic universe. The cover art, much like most of his solo works, was illustrated by himself.

Following in 2023, the folk rock band the Waeve, consisting of Graham Coxon and Rose Elinor Dougall as members, released their debut self-titled album, with an England-wide tour. The duo released their second album, called &quot;City Lights&quot;, in September 2024.

===Transcopic and other contributions===
Coxon&#x27;s independent label, Transcopic, was co-managed with his friend, and then business partner, Jamie Davis. Davis now runs Independent label Ark Recordings. Coxon illustrated and designed all of his own album art, and collaborated with his friend Nick Craske creating abstract digital work for the release of &quot;The Spinning Top&quot;; they also filmed two music videos, &quot;Sorrow&#x27;s Army&quot; and &quot;&#x27;In The Morning&quot;. Coxon also continued painting a series of personal work, most of which remained unseen until 2004, when he exhibited at the ICA in London.

Coxon has also been involved in remixing other peoples tracks, including Idlewild and Lowgold both of which were released as B-sides and the latter remix was later re-released on the band&#x27;s anthology release Keep Music Miserable.

In September 2006, Coxon revealed a musical soundscape, &quot;english shoes squeek,&quot; created especially for &quot;Verheaven&quot; an exhibition at London&#x27;s Riflemaker Gallery of the work of artist Julie Verhoeven.

Coxon appeared on John McCusker&#x27;s &quot;Under One Sky&quot;, providing the song &quot;All Has Gone&quot;.

In 2009, Coxon was involved in the creation of the Pete Doherty solo album &quot;Grace/Wastelands&quot;. Doherty had entered a period of sobriety, during which he holed up with Coxon to work on his debut solo album, &quot;Grace/Wasteland&quot;, (released 24 March 2009) a diverse collection of 12 songs that bounce between reggae and Doherty&#x27;s standard post-punk. Coxon played on all but one track on the album.
Coxon has also produced albums by Mower and Assembly Line People Programme from his Transcopic label.

In 2013, Coxon was involved in a musical project where artists re-recorded the classic Beatles album &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. He recorded the song &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot; live as part of a 10-hour recording session hosted by BBC Radio 2 to mark the 50th anniversary of a challenge set by recording company EMI to The Beatles to record a whole studio album in one session.

In February 2019, Coxon became involved with the writing process of the Duran Duran album Future Past, which reached No.3 on the UK Album Charts and No.1 on the UK Independent charts. He told the UK Independent Newspaper that Duran Duran are &quot;All really nice and they’re not, as individuals, dissimilar to Blur.&quot; Coxon performed with Duran Duran at the 2021 Billboard Awards Show.

==Instruments and equipment==
Coxon has primarily used Fender Telecasters throughout his career, particularly a &#x27;52 reissue and a customised 1968 model with a Gibson PAF humbucker in the neck position, the latter was reissued by Fender as the Graham Coxon signature model although with some minor changes. Since the Blur reunion in 2009 he almost exclusively used a vintage Telecaster Deluxe. During the &quot;Leisure&quot; era Coxon also used Gibson Les Pauls and a Fender Jaguar, whilst on some later songs, such as No Distance Left to Run and This Is a Low, Coxon uses a Gibson ES-335. He has occasionally used a heavily modified Fender Musicmaster which can be seen in the Coffee &amp; TV and Beetlebum videos. Coxon plays all the instruments featured in his solo work, and has used a variety of guitars, notably Gibson SGs, and a Burns London Sonic. He has been recently seen playing a Telecaster Custom.

Graham recently received a custom-made guitar from Gray Guitars; it is a Telecaster-type instrument and features a semi-acoustic body and P90 style pickups.

Coxon&#x27;s playing makes significant use of effects pedals such as distortion, delay (a significant example being &quot;Essex Dogs&quot;) and flange (as heard in the pre-chorus of &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;). He uses a custom made Mike Hill pedalboard which over the years has included: Akai Headrush E2, Boss BF-2 Flanger, Boss CS-3 Compressor/Sustainer, Boss DD-3 Digital Delay, Boss DM-2 Analogue Delay, Boss OD-3, Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor, Boss PN-2 Tremolo/Pan, Boss RV-5 Digital Reverb, Boss TR-2 Tremolo, Boss TU-2 Tuner, Boss VB-2 Vibrato, DOD Punkifier, Electro-Harmonix HOG, Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail, Line 6 FM4 Filter Modeller, ProCo RAT, Shin-Ei FY-2 Companion Fuzz, T-Rex Mudhoney Distortion.

For amplification, he uses two Marshall 1959 SLP heads going in to individual 1968 4x12 cabinets.

A detailed gear diagram of Graham Coxon&#x27;s 1993 Blur guitar rig is well-documented.

==Other artistic endeavours==
Coxon is a visual artist and designs all his album sleeves. He has also designed album sleeves for other artists. In July 2006, he wrote and had published a foreword for a new edition of Hermann Hesse&#x27;s &quot;Narcissus and Goldmund&quot; novel. His work also featured on the cover of English folk singer Kate Rusby&#x27;s album &quot;The Girl Who Couldn&#x27;t Fly&quot;.

In October 2022 his memoir &quot;Verse, Chorus, Monster!&quot; was published by Faber and Faber. 

==Personal life==
Coxon became a teetotaler as a recovering alcoholic. Having previously been married, he is now in a relationship with his Waeve collaborator Rose Elinor Dougall, with whom he has a daughter.

<doc id="294085" wikidata="Q3655892" url="?curid=294085" title="Arithmetization of analysis">
<text>The arithmetization of analysis was a research program in the foundations of mathematics carried out in the second half of the 19th century which aimed to abolish all geometric intuition from the proofs in analysis. For the followers of this program, the fundamental concepts of calculus should also not make references to the ideas of motion and velocity. This ideal was pursued by Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Bernard Bolzano, Karl Weierstrass, among others, who considered that Isaac Newton&#x27;s calculus lacked rigor.

==History==
Kronecker originally introduced the term &quot;arithmetization of analysis&quot;, by which he meant its constructivization in the context of the natural numbers (see quotation at bottom of page). The meaning of the term later shifted to signify the set-theoretic construction of the real line. Its main proponent was Weierstrass, who argued the geometric foundations of calculus were not solid enough for rigorous work. 

==Research program==
The highlights of this research program are:
* the various (but equivalent) constructions of the real numbers by Dedekind and Cantor resulting in the modern axiomatic definition of the real number field;
* the epsilon-delta definition of limit; and
* the naïve set-theoretic definition of function.

==Legacy==
An important spinoff of the arithmetization of analysis is set theory. Naive set theory was created by Cantor and others after arithmetization was completed as a way to study the singularities of functions appearing in calculus. 

The arithmetization of analysis had several important consequences:
* the widely held belief in the banishment of infinitesimals from mathematics until the creation of non-standard analysis by Abraham Robinson in the 1960s, whereas in reality the work on non-Archimedean systems continued unabated, as documented by P. Ehrlich;
* the shift of the emphasis from geometric to algebraic reasoning: this has had important consequences in the way mathematics is taught today;
* it made possible the development of modern measure theory by Lebesgue and the rudiments of functional analysis by Hilbert; 
* it motivated the currently prevalent philosophical position that all of mathematics should be derivable from logic and set theory, ultimately leading to Hilbert&#x27;s program, Gödel&#x27;s theorems and non-standard analysis.

==Quotation==
* &quot;God created the natural numbers, all else is the work of man.&quot; — Kronecker

<text>The Battle of Tolvajärvi ([&#x27;tol.va.jær.vi]; , ) was fought on 12 December 1939 between Finland and the Soviet Union. It was the first large offensive victory for the Finns in the Winter War.

The battle took place on territory of so-called Ladoga Karelia () which today is part of the Republic of Karelia.

==Background==
On 2 December, the Red Army captured Suojärvi, threatening the railroad to the Karelian Isthmus and the rear of the Mannerheim Line. On 6 December, the IV Army Corps was reorganized by Mannerheim into a Group commanded by Talvela. Pajari was immediately ordered by Talvela to defend the western shore of Lake Tolvajärvi, while Per Ole Ekholm was ordered to continue the defense of Ilomantsi. On 10 December, Talvela issued counteroffensive orders to both Pajari and Ekholm for the next day. 

On 11 December, Talvela reorganized the planned attack over frozen lakes Hirvasjärvi and Tolvajärvi, following the Battle of Varolampi Pond on the night of 10–11 December. On 12 December, a reinforced battalion under J.A. Malkamäki, would attack of northern Lake Hirvasjärvi and the rear of northeast Kotisaari Island. Pajari would then advance from the western shore of Lake Tolvajäri across Hevossalmi Strait.

==Composition==
* Finnish side (4,000):
** Talvela Group of the 4th Corps (16th Infantry Regiment)
** Räsänen detachment (4 separate battalions and one artillery battalion of the 6th Artillery Regiment)

The Finnish side consisted of 7 infantry battalions and 30 pieces of artillery.

The Finnish 16th Infantry Regiment was composed of workers out of Tampere city and headed by the chief of police of Tampere.

* Soviet side (20,000):
** 139th Rifle Division of the 8th Army (718th, 609th, 364th Rifle regiments)

The Soviet side consisted of 9 infantry battalions, 60 artillery pieces, one scout battalion, one signal battalion, one sapper battalion, 30 tanks, and 376 planes.

==Battle==
Malkamäki&#x27;s attack was delayed until daylight when it encountered two battalions of the Soviet 718th Regiment preparing to make its own attack on the Finnish flank. The opposing attacks cancelled each other. The Finnish Third Company retreated back to the Tolvajärvi-Kokkari road, while the Second Company crossed the lake and turned south before stalling near the Hirvasvaara ridge. By noon, Malkamäki ordered a retreat around the northern end of the lake. However, parts of the Second Company remained in the Hirvasaara area in support of Pajari&#x27;s flank. Simultaneously, the Finnish First and Second Companies of ErP 112 attacked the southern end of Kotisaari Island, but were forced to retreat to the south by early afternoon. 

Pajari&#x27;s attack across the Tolvajärvi peninsula was also delayed until 9:15, meeting resistance 200 yards west of the tourist hotel. Three Soviet tanks were disabled, and Pajari committed his reserves in an attack on the hill containing the hotel, and Hirvasharju. Becoming demoralized by the renewed attacks, the Soviets began to retreat. ErP 112 renewed its attack on Kotisaari Island and threatened the Soviet supply road at Kivisalmi. The Soviet commander Belyaev then ordered the withdrawal of his 139th Division as far as Ristisalmi. 

On 14 December, the Finns renewed their counteroffensive, now encountering the Soviet 75th Division, reserves sent in to replace the 139th. Yet, by the end of the day the Finnish troops had secured the Ristisalmi Strait and the Soviets continued their retreat towards Metsänvaara. On 17 Talvela committed all of his reserves to Pajari. On 18 December, the battle had reached Ägläjärvi, which fell on 22 December. On 23 December, the Finnish troops reached the Aittojoki River.

==Aftermath==
Mannerheim called a halt to the advance along the Aittojoki River, and ordered defensive positions prepared. The Red Army&#x27;s losses along the Tolvajärvi-Aittojoki road included 4000 dead, 580 prisoners, 59 tanks, and 220 machine guns. Yet, by this time the Finnish losses were also accumulating, especially after the frontal attacks at Tolvajärvi and Ägläjärvi. According to Allen Chew, for the Finns, &quot;Proportionally, these were the heaviest losses of the entire war,&quot; with 630 killed and 1320 wounded. Yet despite the Finnish losses associated with their first offensive victory, according to Chew, &quot;It would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of the Finnish victory,&quot; eliminating the threat to Ladoga-Karelia, and ensuring national survival with a sense of optimism. The arrival of Talvela and Pajari, according to Erik Heinrichs, &quot;...overturned the depressed mood and fatigue...a fascinating example of what, in a war, can be accomplished by strong will power and strong mind.&quot; During the battle, Talvela was promoted to Major General and Pajari to full Colonel.

General Belyaev was dismissed from commanding on 16 December 1939, but preserved his rank. In June 1940 after re-attestation he was granted the rank of major general.

<doc id="294090" wikidata="Q3278180" url="?curid=294090" title="Mail on Sunday (album)">
<text>Mail on Sunday is the debut studio album by American rapper Flo Rida, and was released on March 18, 2008 under Atlantic, and Poe Boy Entertainment. It spawned three singles; the first, &quot;Low&quot; was number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for 10 weeks. The second, and third singles, &quot;Elevator&quot;, and &quot;In the Ayer&quot;, were successful as well, being top 20 hits. &quot;Roll&quot; featuring Sean Kingston was not an official single, but it managed to peak at number 59 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number 43 on the Canadian Hot 100 due to digital sales in both countries.

==Music==
T-Pain, who laced the first single, is only one of the many featured guests throughout the album. Timbaland, who produced the second single &quot;Elevator&quot;, is also featured on the track. Rick Ross, and Trey Songz made appearances as well. Lil Wayne has also been added to the list with assistance by young Memphian, Jamil Smith, while Sean Kingston appears on the J. R. Rotem-produced &quot;Roll&quot; the concept was created, and co-written by Compton rapper Spitfiya, from The Bullets Production Team, Various other guests include Birdman, Brisco. The third single is &quot;In the Ayer&quot; featuring will.i.am. The fourth single was scheduled to be &quot;Money Right&quot; featuring Brisco, and Rick Ross, but was canceled due to the release of his upcoming second studio album R.O.O.T.S. His second collaboration with T-Pain, &quot;I Bet&quot;, his collaboration with Trina, named &quot;Bout It&quot; and as well as his second collaboration with Sean Kingston named &quot;OG&quot;, all three didn&#x27;t make the final track list, but were recorded. As for production, J. R. Rotem, DJ Montay, and Timbaland all provided tracks for &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;, among others.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; garnered mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 54, based on 12 reviews.

Steve &#x27;Flash&#x27; Juon of &quot;RapReviews&quot; praised the album for containing great production and tracks that are potential singles but found the artist on said album lacking in identity, concluding with, &quot;When you try to come up with positive comparisons to other artists, you realize just how derivative Flo Rida is. He&#x27;s a little bit Twista, a little bit Trick Daddy, and a whole lot Nelly. None of those things are negative, but the fact he can&#x27;t distinguish himself from any of them isn&#x27;t a positive. I&#x27;d like to see Flo Rida convince me why he&#x27;s special with his next album - until then he&#x27;s just another MC with a well produced album who came out of a cookie cutter hitmaking mold.&quot; Joseph Barracato of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also praised the production for having &quot;ferocious beats&quot; and &quot;infectious hooks,&quot; and gave credit to Flo Rida for delivering female anatomy metaphors in a creative way. &quot;Billboard&quot; writer Jeff Vrabel said that, &quot;Flo Rida&#x27;s flow is an engaging/ringy-dingy/he-sounds-like-Nelly thing. But his hooks can be rock-solid (&quot;Ack Like You Know&quot;) and his interest in gleaming synthesizerism (opener &quot;American Superstar&quot; comes into &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; territory, really) helps set him off from the legions of rappers clawing over each other to break out of the South.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s Andy Kellman said that, &quot;Though Flo Rida has his own identity – for all the tough talk and the automotives fixation, he does come off as big-hearted, and he could just as easily make an R&amp;B album – and covers more bases than what is typical from other mainstream-yet-street rap albums of 2007 and 2008, he&#x27;s not nearly as distinctive as any of his predecessors.&quot; Robert Christgau graded the album as a &quot;dud&quot;, indicating &quot;a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Christian Hoard found the album trying hard to replicate the success of &quot;Low&quot; but found the tracks to be &quot;generic pop rap&quot; and both the production and vocal delivery &quot;standard-issue.&quot; Wilson McBee of Slant Magazine criticized the record&#x27;s tired use of party tracks, phoned in contributions, and misogynistic lyrical content, concluding that &quot;unless he can once again catch the coattails of T-Pain or some other hit-magnet, odds are that he’ll be beginning his descent back into anonymity very soon.&quot;

==Sales==
&quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; debuted at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 86,000 copies in its first week. As of May, 2009, the album has sold 390,000 copies in the US. It has been certified silver for sales in the UK.

<doc id="294091" wikidata="Q1096120" url="?curid=294091" title="Classic rock">
<text>Classic rock is a radio format that developed from the album-oriented rock (AOR) format in the early 1980s. In the United States, it comprises rock music ranging generally from the mid-1960s through the mid-1990s, primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format. The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s.

Although classic rock has mostly appealed to adult listeners, music associated with this format received more exposure with younger listeners with the presence of the Internet and digital downloading. Some classic rock stations also play a limited number of current releases which are stylistically consistent with the station&#x27;s sound, or by heritage acts which are still active and producing new music.

Among academics and historians, classic rock has been discussed as an effort by critics, media, and music establishments to canonize rock music and commodify 1960s Western culture for audiences living in a post-baby boomer economy. The music selected for the format has been identified as predominantly commercially successful songs by white male acts from the Anglosphere, expressing values of Romanticism, self-aggrandizement, and politically undemanding ideologies. It has been associated with the album era (1960s–2000s), particularly the period&#x27;s early pop/rock music.

==History==

The classic rock format evolved from AOR radio stations that were attempting to appeal to an older audience by including familiar songs of the past with current hits. In 1980, AOR radio station M105 in Cleveland began billing itself as &quot;Cleveland&#x27;s Classic Rock&quot;, playing a mix of rock music from the mid-1960s to the present. Similarly, WMET called itself &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Classic Rock&quot; in 1981. In 1982, radio consultant Lee Abrams developed the &quot;Timeless Rock&quot; format, which combined contemporary AOR with rock hits from the 1960s and 1970s.

KRBE, an AM station in Houston, was an early classic rock radio station. In 1983, program director Paul Christy designed a format which played only early album rock, from the 1960s and early 1970s, without current music or any titles from the pop or dance side of Top 40. Another AM station airing classic rock, beginning in 1983, was KRQX in Dallas-Fort Worth. KRQX was co-owned with an album rock station, 97.9 KZEW. Management saw the benefit in the FM station appealing to younger rock fans and the AM station appealing a bit older. The ratings of both stations could be added together to appeal to advertisers. Classic rock soon became the widely used descriptor for the format and became the commonly used term among the general public for early album rock music.

In the mid-1980s, the format&#x27;s widespread proliferation came on the heels of Jacobs Media&#x27;s (Fred Jacobs) success at WCXR, in Washington, D.C., and Edinborough Rand&#x27;s (Gary Guthrie) success at WZLX in Boston. Between Guthrie and Jacobs, they converted more than 40 major market radio stations to their individual brand of classic rock over the next several years.

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Kim Freeman posits that &quot;while classic rock&#x27;s origins can be traced back earlier, 1986 is generally cited as the year of its birth&quot;. By 1986, the success of the format resulted in oldies accounting for 60–80% of the music played on album rock stations. Although it began as a niche format spun off from AOR, by 2001, classic rock had surpassed album rock in market share nationally.

During the mid-1980s, the classic rock format was mainly tailored to the adult male demographic ages 25–34, which remained its largest demographic through the mid-1990s. As the format&#x27;s audience aged, its demographics skewed toward older age groups. By 2006, the 35–44 age group was the format&#x27;s largest audience; by 2014, the 45–54 year-old demographic was the largest.

Typically, classic rock stations play rock songs from the mid-1960s through the 1980s and began adding 1990s music in the early 2010s. Most recently, there has been a &quot;newer classic rock&quot; under the slogan of the next generation of classic rock. Stations such as WLLZ in Detroit, WBOS in Boston, and WKQQ in Lexington play music focusing more on harder edge classic rock from the 1980s to the 2000s.

Some of the artists that are featured heavily on classic rock radio are The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Quiet Riot, Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp, Def Leppard, Boston, The Cars, Fleetwood Mac, Billy Joel, Elton John, Eric Clapton, The Who, Van Halen, Rush, Black Sabbath, U2, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Eagles, the Doors, Styx, Queen, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix. The songs of the Rolling Stones, particularly from the 1970s, have become staples of classic rock radio. &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; (1965), &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; (1966), &quot;Paint It Black&quot; (1966), and &quot;Miss You&quot; (1978) are among their most popular selections, with &quot;Complex&quot; calling the latter &quot;an eternal mainstay on classic-rock radio&quot;.

A 2006 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article noted that teens were surprisingly interested in classic rock and speculated that the interest in the older bands might be related to the absence of any new, dominant sounds in rock music since the advent of grunge.

== Characteristics and academic response ==
Classic-rock radio programmers largely play &quot;tried and proven&quot; hit songs from the past based on their &quot;high listener recognition and identification&quot;, says media academic Roy Shuker, who also identifies white male rock acts from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;-era Beatles through the late 1970s as the focus of their playlists. As Catherine Strong observes, classic rock songs are generally performed by white male acts from either the United States or the United Kingdom, &quot;have a four-four time, very rarely exceed the time limit of four minutes, were composed by the musicians themselves, are sung in English, played by a &#x27;classical&#x27; rock formation (drums, bass, guitar, keyboard instruments) and were released on a major label after 1964.&quot; Classic rock has also been associated with the album era (1960s–2000s), by writers Bob Lefsetz and Matthew Restall, who says the term is a relabeling of the &quot;virtuoso pop/rock&quot; from the era&#x27;s early decades.

The format&#x27;s origins are traced by music scholar Jon Stratton to the emergence of a classic-rock canon. This canon arose in part from music journalism and superlative lists ranking certain albums and songs that are consequently reinforced to the collective and public memory. Robert Christgau says the classic-rock concept transmogrified rock music into a &quot;myth of rock as art-that-stands-the-test-of-time&quot;. He also believes it was inevitable that certain rock artists would be canonized by critics, major media, and music establishment entities such as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2018, Steven Hyden recalls how the appearance of classic rock as a timeless music lent it a distinction from the &quot;inherently nihilistic&quot; pop he had first listened to on the radio as a teenager in the early 1990s. &quot;[I]t seemed to have been around forever,&quot; he writes of the classic rock format. &quot;It was there long before I was born, and I was sure it was still going to be around after I was gone.&quot;

Politically, the mindset underlying classic rock is regarded by Christgau as regressive. He says the music in this format abandoned ironic sensibilities in favor of unintellectual, conventional aesthetics rooted in Victorian era Romanticism, while downplaying the more radical aspects of 1960s counterculture, such as politics, race, African-American music, and pop in the art sense. &quot;Though classic rock draws its inspiration and most of its heroes from the &#x27;60s, it is, of course, a construction of the &#x27;70s,&quot; he writes in 1991 for &quot;Details&quot; magazine. &quot;It was invented by prepunk/predisco radio programmers who knew that before they could totally commodify &#x27;60s culture they&#x27;d have to rework it—that is, selectively distort it till it threatened no one ... In the official rock pantheon the Doors and Led Zeppelin are Great Artists while Chuck Berry and Little Richard are Primitive Forefathers and James Brown and Sly Stone are Something Else.&quot;

Regarding the relationship of economics to the rise of classic rock, Christgau believes there was compromised socioeconomic security and diminishing collective consciousness of a new generation of listeners in the 1970s, who succeeded rock&#x27;s early years during baby-boomer economic prosperity in the United States: &quot;Not for nothing did classic rock crown the Doors&#x27; mystagogic middlebrow escapism and Led Zep&#x27;s chest-thumping megalomaniac grandeur. Rhetorical self-aggrandizement that made no demands on everyday life was exactly what the times called for.&quot; Shuker attributes the rise of classic-rock radio in part to &quot;the consumer power of the aging post-war &#x27;baby boomers&#x27; and the appeal of this group to radio advertisers&quot;. In his opinion, classic rock also produced a rock music ideology and discussion of the music that was &quot;heavily gendered&quot;, celebrating &quot;a male homosocial paradigm of musicianship&quot; that &quot;continued to dominate subsequent discourse, not just around rock music, but of popular music more generally.&quot;

<text>Stocks are feet restraining devices that were used as a form of corporal punishment and public humiliation. The use of stocks is seen as early as Ancient Greece, where they are described as being in use in Solon&#x27;s law code. The law describing its use is cited by the orator Lysias: &quot;&#x27;He shall have his or her foot confined in the stocks for five days, if the court shall make such addition to the sentence.&#x27; The &#x27;stocks&#x27; there mentioned, Theomnestus, are what we now call &#x27;confinement in the wood&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Lys&quot;. 10.16).

==Form and applications==
The stocks, pillory, and pranger each consist of large wooden boards with hinges; however, the stocks are distinguished by their restraint of the feet.

The stocks consist of placing boards around the ankles and wrists, whereas with the pillory, the boards are fixed to a pole and placed around the arms and neck, forcing the punished to stand.

Victims may be insulted, kicked, tickled, spat on especially between the toes, or subjected to other inhumane acts. In the Bible, the treatment of Paul and Silas, disciples of Jesus, was detailed in the Acts of the Apostles: &quot;Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.&quot; The Old Testament&#x27;s book of Job also describes the stocks, referring to God:
:&quot;He puts my feet in the stocks, he watches all my paths.&quot;

The stocks were employed by civil and military authorities from medieval to early modern times including Colonial America. Public punishment in the stocks was a common occurrence from around 1500 until at least 1748. The stocks were especially popular among the early American Puritans, who frequently employed the stocks for punishing the &quot;lower class&quot;.

In the American colonies, the stocks were also used, not only for punishment, but as a means of restraining individuals awaiting trial.

The offender would be exposed to whatever treatment those who passed by could imagine. This could include tickling of the feet. As noted by the &quot;New York Times&quot; in an article dated November 13, 1887, &quot;Gone, too, are the parish stocks, in which offenders against public morality formerly sat imprisoned, with their legs held fast beneath a heavy wooden yoke, while sundry small but fiendish boys and girls improved the occasion by deliberately pulling off their socks and shoes and tickling the soles of their defenseless feet.&quot;
England&#x27;s Statute of Labourers 1351 prescribed the use of the stocks for &quot;unruly artisans&quot; and required that every town and village erect a set of stocks. In towns and cities they were commonly placed in prominent central locations, such as the one before Bristol&#x27;s High Cross. The 1351 Act was repealed in 1863. Sources indicate that the stocks were used in England for over 500 years and have never been formally abolished.

Their last recorded use in the United Kingdom was on 11 June 1872 at Newbury, Berkshire, England.

In Toronto, Ontario, Canada, court records from 1811 required the building of a set of stocks for punishment.
The Spanish conquistadores introduced stocks as a popular form of punishment and humiliation against those who impeded the consolidation of their settlements in the new world. They were still used in the 19th century in Latin America to punish indigenous miners in many countries for rebelling against their bosses.

== Modern use ==
=== United States ===
In 1989, the Arkansas town of Dermott passed a curfew law punishable by up to thirty days in jail for the offender and up to two days in the stocks for the offender&#x27;s parents. The city almost immediately remitted the punishment because, among other things, the city did not have a set of stocks and had allocated no funds to build one.

===United Kingdom===
The British town of Thame made international headlines in 2016 when it took up a proposal to build stocks in the town. Introduced by Councillor David Bretherton, the stocks would be used for hire and for charitable events. As noted by Bretherton, &quot;Perhaps for charity we could do something like that, get people in the stocks and have others donate money for the time they last while having their feet tickled and syrup poured between their toes for laughs.&quot; Bretherton noted that the stocks were still legal in England. It is not believed that the stocks would be used for actual punishment purposes. Currently, further study of the topic is ongoing.

=== Colombia ===
In Colombia in 2012, married thirty-four-year-old Alfreda Blanco Basilio and her eighteen-year-old lover Luis Martinez were placed in stocks by the Sampues tribe in Colombia due to Basilio&#x27;s adultery. Basilio spent 72 hours barefoot in the stocks for her offense.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, police in Chinu, Colombia, placed residents who broke quarantine in stocks for a few hours. 

==Examples==
Stocks are occasionally preserved in churches or museums; as wooden devices they are naturally subject to rotting and decay. Some have been heavily restored in the 19th and 20th centuries. Most are protected as listed buildings.

<text>Paavo Juho Talvela (born Paavo Juho Thorén; 19 February 1897 – 30 September 1973) was a Finnish general of the infantry, Knight of the Mannerheim Cross and a member of the Jäger movement. He participated in the Eastern Front of World War I, the Finnish Civil War, the Finnish Kinship Wars, the Winter War and the Continuation War.

Talvela was also active in Finnish far-right politics, being involved in both the founding of the Academic Karelia Society and in the Lapua Movement. In 1940, he was also involved in talks with Germany about forming a Finnish Jäger battalion as part of the Wehrmacht. 

== Early life ==

Paavo Juho Talvela (originally Thorén) was born 19 January 1897 to farmer parents Johan Fredrik Thorén and Helena Uino in Helsingin maalaiskunta. One of eleven children, Talvela enrolled in secondary education, but became involved in the Jäger Movement, where Finnish volunteers received military training in Germany, leaving for Germany in 1916. While in Germany, the Finnish volunteers formed the 27th Royal Prussian Jäger Battalion, fighting for the Imperial German Army on the Eastern Front of World War I. During this time, Talvela saw combat in battles in the regions of Misa and Gulf of Riga, but was sent to Sweden and Finland for &quot;special tasks&quot; in 1917. He was arrested on the Finno-Swedish border and detained by Swedish authorities for multiple months. In late 1917, Talvela was able to enter Finland by traveling to Turku via Åland. In December 1917, Talvela moved from Turku to Vimpeli, where he would act as a military instructor. During 1918, Talvela took part in the Finnish Civil War on the side of the Whites under the pseudonym Strömsten. In 1918, Talvela was promoted from the private-equivalent rank of jäger directly to a lieutenant of the Finnish Army.

Talvela was promoted to a major after the civil war, briefly commanding both a battalion and a regiment, but resigned in 1919 to participate as a regimental commander in the Kinship Wars of the 1920s. Talvela became the commander-in-chief of the Aunus expedition after it had reached Petrozavodsk. After the failure of the Aunus expedition, Talvela re-joined the Finnish Army, but continued to view efforts to integrate East Karelia to Finland as crucial for both the security and the economy of the newly-independent Finland. As such, Talvela resigned again in 1921 to command a battalion during the Viena expedition which also failed. Following the failed military expeditions, Talvela joined the Finnish army the third time in 1922. He was also involved behind-the-scenes in the founding of the Academic Karelia Society, a student association that was also the first Finnish radical nationalistic movement.

Having returned to service, Talvela graduated from the English Coast Artillery School in 1923 before acting as the chief of coastal artillery in 1925. In 1926, he graduated from the Finnish War College, taking on the duties of commander of the Savo Jäger Regiment in 1926–1927. Following a 1925 promotion to lieutenant colonel, he was promoted a colonel in 1928. In 1930, he acted as the head of the Finnish General HQ&#x27;s Operations Section, but conflicts with the head of the Finnish General Staff Martti Wallenius led to Talvela&#x27;s third resignation.

Following his resignation, Talvela became politically active. He was a member of the electoral college for the President of Finland in 1931. He also became active in the radically nationalistic and &quot;fascist-style&quot; Lapua Movement, organizing the Peasant March. The movement was disbanded in the wake of the Mäntsälä Rebellion. Talvela ran for parliament as a member of Kokoomus in 1936 but was not elected. Talvela was also active in various economic affairs, working as the deputy director of Suomi-Filmi from 1929 to 1932 and the Finnish state alcohol monopoly Oy Alkoholiliike Ab from 1932 to 1937, following the end of the Finnish prohibition. From 1937 to 1939, Talvela worked as the deputy director of , the association of Finnish cellulose producers. Concurrently with these duties, Talvela continued his activities in national defense, working as the chair of the Jäger Union to 1934 and in the governmental Defense Council.

== Winter War and Continuation War ==

The Finno-Soviet Winter War broke out on the morning of 30 November 1939 with a Soviet assault over the Finno-Soviet border on the Karelian Isthmus. In the lead-up to the war, Talvela had been promoted to a major general and became a member of the war materiel council, but just two days after the start of the war he approached the Finnish commander-in-chief Mannerheim asking for a field command. Talvela proposed that he should be given command of a regiment of the 7th Division, which was being held as commander-in-chief&#x27;s reserve. On 6 December, Mannerheim ordered that the Finnish IV corps would be split into two commands, with one being given to Talvela. Talvela&#x27;s orders were to halt and throw back the Soviet advance in the area of Tolvajärvi. 

The Finnish position in the Tolvajärvi region was in severe danger, and upon arriving in his area of operations Talvela&#x27;s first task was to halt the retreat of Infantry Regiment 16. The following Battle of Tolvajärvi resulted in a Soviet retreat and the first Finnish victory of the war: The Soviet 139th Rifle Division lost its headquarters and most of its artillery. The 139th Division was replaced with the 75th Division, which was also forced to retreat just a few days later. Following these victories, the area saw only limited action to the end of the war. In February, Talvela was given command of the III Corps on the Karelian Isthmus in the area of Vuoksi and Lake Sukhodolskoye.

During the Interim Peace, in 1940, Talvela took part in the Finno-German negotiations regarding weapons shipments and the movement of German troops through Finland. He was made the chair of Suomen Aseveljien Liitto, the Union of Finnish Brothers-in-Arms. Talvela was also involved in 1940 talks about establishing a Finnish jaeger battalion within the German Wehrmacht. While these talks didn&#x27;t lead to results, the Germans recruited some 1400 Finnish volunteers into the Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS between 1941 and 1943.

At the start of the Continuation War in 1941, Talvela commanded the II Corps, but immediately following the start of the hostilities he was given command of the VI Corps. Under his command, the VI Corps participated in the Finnish invasion of Ladoga Karelia. As part of the Army of Karelia, VI Corps surrounded parts of the Soviet 7th Army north of Lake Ladoga. On 3 August 1941, Talvela was granted the Mannerheim Cross. The VI Corps reached Svir in September 1941, with the Finnish forces forming a 100 kilometer wide, 20 kilometer deep bridgehead over the river, thus cutting the Murmansk railroad. The Finns&#x27; refusal to advance further from Svir caused strain in the Finno-German relations, as German forces were able to reach a point some 80 kilometers to the southwest of the Finnish positions. The Germans had even moved the German 163rd Division to the Svir to help in securing the flanks for the &quot;handshake at the Svir&quot;. The issue resolved itself once Soviet counter-attacks pushed the Germans further from the Svir in the south. In January 1942, Talvela was removed from his position as the commander of VI Corps and transferred to Germany, where he was the representative of the Finnish army in the German high command.

Talvela was recalled to Finland in February 1944. Having been promoted to lieutenant general in 1942, he was given command of the Aunus Group, which was in charge of the Finnish forces along the Svir. Following a Soviet landing in Tuloksa as part of the Soviet Svir–Petrozavodsk Offensive in 1944, the Finnish IV Corps, part of Talvela&#x27;s Aunus Group, was in danger of being cut off. When the commander of VI Corps, general Aarne Blick, requested permission to pull back, Talvela refused and ordered the corps to instead conduct a delaying action. Blick ignored the orders, pulling VI Corps back, causing significant strain in the two commanders&#x27; personal relations. The animosity resulted in the replacement of Blick on 6 July. 

On 16 July 1944, the Aunus Group was disbanded and Talvela was ordered to return to Germany. He would stay in Germany until the Finno-Soviet cease-fire and the breaking of the Finno-German relations, both of which came as a surprise to him. Before leaving Germany, Talvela was approached by Himmler, who requested that Talvela would lead Finnish armed resistance. Talvela indicated that he would be willing to lead a resistance movement, but only under orders from Mannerheim.

== Later life and legacy ==

Talvela left the army in September 1944, returning to his job as the director of Pohjolan Liikenne which he had taken during the Interim Peace. As a result of the time he had spent in Germany during the war, he found working in Finland difficult, and lived in Rio de Janeiro selling cellulose between 1946 and 1949. Talvela returned to Finland in 1949, serving as a member of the City Council of Helsinki between 1954 and 1960. In 1958, he was the head consul for Philippines. He continued to be active in various activities related to paper production until his retirement. Talvela received his final promotion to the rank of general of the infantry () in 1966.

Talvela married twice during his life. His first marriage with Martta Sofia Nikoskelainen ran from 1919 to 1922, ending in a divorce. He remarried in 1923 to Karin Johanna Tengman. During his marriages, Talvela had a total of four children, born between 1919 and 1926. He secretly had a fifth child born out of wedlock, Swedish writer Gunilla Boëthius in 1945; this wasn&#x27;t discovered until long after his death. Talvela died on 30 September 1973 in Helsinki. He is buried in the Kulosaari Cemetery in Helsinki.

During his career, Talvela was granted several awards. The most notable of these is the Mannerheim Cross, which Talvela was the second to receive. He also received the Finnish Order of the Cross of Liberty and the Order of the White Rose. He also received the German Iron Cross (both 1st and 2nd class), German Cross in Gold and the Order of Merit of the German Eagle; the Swedish Order of the Sword and Order of Vasa; the Order of the Crown of Italy; and the Norwegian Order of St. Olav.

<text>In cryptography, 3-Way is a block cipher designed in 1994 by Joan Daemen. It is closely related to BaseKing; the two are variants of the same general cipher technique.

3-Way has a block size of 96 bits, notably not a power of two such as the more common 64 or 128 bits. The key length is also 96 bits. The figure 96 arises from the use of three 32 bit words in the algorithm, from which also is derived the cipher&#x27;s name. When 3-Way was invented, 96-bit keys and blocks were quite strong, but more recent ciphers have a 128-bit block, and few now have keys shorter than 128 bits. 3-Way is an 11-round substitution–permutation network.

3-Way is designed to be very efficient in a wide range of platforms from 8-bit processors to specialized hardware, and has some elegant mathematical features which enable nearly all the decryption to be done in exactly the same circuits as did the encryption.

3-Way, just as its counterpart BaseKing, is vulnerable to related key cryptanalysis. John Kelsey, Bruce Schneier, and David Wagner showed how it can be broken with one related key query and about formula_1 chosen plaintexts.

<text>The Jet d&#x27;Eau (, &quot;Water-Jet&quot;) is a large fountain in Geneva, Switzerland and is one of the city&#x27;s most famous landmarks, being featured on the city&#x27;s official tourism web site and on the official logo for Geneva&#x27;s hosting of group stage matches at UEFA Euro 2008. Situated where Lake Geneva exits as the Rhône, it is visible throughout the city and from the air, even when flying over Geneva at an altitude of .

 of water per second are jetted to an altitude of by two 500 kW pumps, operating at 2,400 V, consuming one megawatt of electricity and costing 510,000 CHF per year. The water leaves the nozzle at a speed of . At any given moment, there are about of water in the air. Unsuspecting visitors to the fountain—which can be reached via a stone jetty from the left bank of the lake—may be surprised to find themselves drenched after a slight change in wind direction.

== History ==
The first Jet d&#x27;Eau was installed in 1886 at the Usine de la Coulouvrenière, a little further downstream from its present location. It was used as a safety valve for a hydraulic power network and could reach a height of about . In 1891, its aesthetic value was recognised and it was moved to its present location to celebrate the Federal Gymnastics Festival and the 600th anniversary of the Swiss Confederation, when it was operated for the first time. Its maximum height was about . The present Jet d&#x27;Eau was installed in 1951 in a partially submerged pumping station to pump lake water instead of city water.

Since 2003, the fountain has operated during the day all year round, except in case of frost or particularly strong wind. It also operates in the evenings between spring and autumn, when it is lit by a set of 21 lights consuming 9 kW.

On 25 August 2016, the fountain celebrated its 125th anniversary at its present location. Between 30 March and 11 June 2020, the jet was shut off while the city was under public health measures due to COVID-19.

The Jet d&#x27;Eau featured in the titles and cut scenes of the late 1960s British television series &quot;The Champions&quot;.

<text>Gudrid Thorbjarnardóttir (Old Norse: ; Modern Icelandic: ; born possibly around 980–1019) was an Icelandic explorer, born at Laugarbrekka in Snæfellsnes, Iceland.

She appears in the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; and the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, known collectively as the &quot;Vinland sagas&quot;. She and her husband Thorfinn Karlsefni led an expedition to Vinland where their son Snorri Thorfinnsson was born, the first known European birth in the Americas (outside of Greenland).

In Iceland, Gudrid is known by her byname víðförla (lit. &quot;wide-fared&quot; or &quot;far-travelled&quot;).

==Biography==
As recorded in &quot;The Saga of Erik the Red&quot;, Gudrid was the daughter of a chieftain by the name of Thorbjorn of Laugarbrekka. As the story goes, a young man by the name of Einar asked for her hand in marriage, but because his father was a slave, Gudrid&#x27;s father refused to give her hand in marriage. Gudrid and her father promptly left Iceland and voyaged to Greenland to accompany Erik the Red. Thirty others went with them on the journey, but the group experienced complications due to poor weather, which slowed their progress during the summer. After this setback, illness plagued the group and half of the company died. Despite these failures, Gudrid and her father landed safely in Greenland in the winter. Although it is not mentioned in &quot;The Saga of Erik the Red&quot;, according to the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, at the time Gudrid was married to a Norwegian merchant named Thorir. According to this account, Leif Erikson rescued Gudrid and fifteen men from a skerry, brought them safely to Brattahlíð, and invited Thorir and Gudrid to stay there with him. That winter, Thorir died of illness.

In Eirik the Red&#x27;s Saga, Gudrid exemplifies the transition from the pagan Norse religion to Christianity. One winter, Gudrid, her father Thorbjorn, and his companions feast at the home of Thorkel, who is visited by a seeress named Thorbjorg. Thorbjorg arrives at Thorkel&#x27;s home, intending to carry out several magic rites, specifically ward songs, for which she needs the women present to help chant. Gudrid is the only woman present who knows the songs, having been taught them by her foster-mother Halldis, but she tells Thorbjorg that &quot;These are the sort of actions in which I intend to take no part, because I am a Christian woman&quot;. With minimal effort, however, Thorbjorg and Thorkel convince Gudrid that taking part in the chants will help the people present, and not damage her status as a Christian woman. Gudrid performs the songs with admirable skill.

According to both sagas, Gudrid then married Thorstein Eiriksson, Leif Eiriksson&#x27;s younger brother and Eirik the Red&#x27;s son. According to the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, Gudrid then accompanied her husband on his quest to Vinland, with the hope that he could retrieve the body of his brother Thorvald. The two spent the winter in Lysufjord with a man by the name of Thorstein the Black and his wife Grimhild, but illness soon struck the group and both Grimhild and Gudrid&#x27;s husband Thorstein died. According to this account, Thorstein temporarily rises from his dead bed to tell Gudrid that she will be married to an Icelander and that they will have a long life together with many descendants. He stated that she would leave Greenland to go to Norway and then Iceland, and after a pilgrimage south, she would return to Iceland, where a church would be built near her farm. According to the &quot;Saga of Eirik the Red&quot;, Thorstein makes the voyage to Vinland by himself, and it is only upon his return that the two marry. According to the Saga, &quot;Thorstein had a farm and livestock in the western settlement at a place called Lysufjord&quot; and another man by the name of Thorstein (whose wife in this version is named Sigrid) owned a half-share on this farm. The couple moved to the farm and, as in the &quot;Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, Thorstein died and told Gudrid of her future, although in this version he focuses more on the importance of Christianity, asking Gudrid to &quot;donate their money to the poor.&quot;

After his death, Gudrid moved back to Brattahlíð, where she married a merchant named Thorfinn Karlsefni, who is described in the &quot;Saga of Eirik the Red&quot; as being &quot;a man of good family and good means&quot; and &quot;a merchant of good repute&quot;. According to &quot;The Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, after their marriage, and at Gudrid&#x27;s urging, the two led an attempt to settle Vínland with sixty men, five women, and a cargo of various livestock (while it is implied in &quot;The Saga of Eirik the Red&quot; that she accompanies him, Gudrid is never actually mentioned in the account of the journey). While in Vínland, the couple had a son whom they named Snorri Thorfinnsson, who is the first European reported to be born in the Western Hemisphere. There is speculation about the birth date of Snorri with birth years such as 1005, 1009, and 1012 being postulated, but all sources agree that he was born between 1005 and 1013. According to the Vinland sagas, when Snorri was 3 years old, the family left Vinland because of hostilities with indigenous peoples (called &quot;Skrælingar&quot; by the settlers, meaning &quot;barbarians&quot;). The family returned to the Glaumbær farm in Seyluhreppur, Iceland.

According to &quot;The Saga of Eirik the Red&quot;, the couple had another son named Thorbjorn. Although it is only mentioned in &quot;The Saga of the Greenlanders&quot;, Thorfin died, leaving Gudrid to live as a widow.

Christianisation of Iceland during this period meant that religious conversions were common. Gudrid converted to Christianity and, when Snorri married, went on a pilgrimage to Rome. While some have discussed the possibility that Gudrid spoke with the Pope on her journey, there is no proof of it. While she was away, Snorri built a church near the estate, fulfilling the prediction that Thorstein had made. When she came back from Rome, she became a nun and lived in the church as a hermit.

==Genealogy==
Her son Snorri Thorfinnsson had two children: a daughter named Hallfrid, and a son named Thorgeir. Hallfrid was the mother of Thorlak Runolfsson, bishop of Skálholt in the south of Iceland. Thorgeir was the father of Yngvild, the mother of the first Bishop Brand. One of the descendants of her son Thorbjorn, Bjorn Gilsson, was also a bishop of Hólar.

Below is the genealogy of descendants of Snorri, as given in the close of each saga, &quot;Grœnlendinga saga&quot; ch. 9 and &quot;Eiríks saga&quot; ch. 14. It is supplemented with further ancestral information from (&quot;Eiríks saga&quot; ch. 7 and &quot;Landnámabók&quot;), a more complete family tree for which, see Thorfinn Karlsefni.







==Memorials==

There is a statue created by the sculptor Ásmundur Sveinsson in 1938 for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair of Gudrid on display at Glaumbær, in Iceland. Its original Icelandic title refers to Gudrid as &quot;Fyrsta hvíta móðirin í Ameríku&quot; (The first white mother in America). Other copies of this statue, which typically refer to Gudrid as the &quot;first European mother in America,&quot; are on display in Laugarbrekka in the Snæfellsnes peninsula on Iceland, in Ottawa, Canada, and at the Vatican. The statue depicts her on a boat, carrying her son Snorri on her shoulder.

==In popular culture==
Gudrid features as a main character in many modern literary works including Maurice Hewlett&#x27;s &quot;Gudrid the Fair&quot; (1918), Harry Harrison&#x27;s &quot;The Technicolor Time Machine&quot; (1967), Constance Irwin&#x27;s &quot;Gudrid&#x27;s Saga&quot; (1974), Elizabeth Boyer&#x27;s &quot;Freydis and Gudrid&quot; (1976), John Andrew&#x27;s &quot;A Viking&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1989), Kirsten Seaver&#x27;s &quot;Gudrids saga&quot; (1994), Jónas Kristjánsson&#x27;s &quot;Veröld við&quot; (1998), Margaret Elphinstone&#x27;s &quot;The Sea Road&quot; (2000), Nancy Marie Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Saga of Gudrid the Far-Traveler&quot; (2015), Gert Maarløw Nicolaisen&#x27;s &quot;Nornespind&quot; (2018), Mathijs Deen&#x27;s &quot;Over oude wegen&quot; (2018), a collection of historical European travelogues, and numerous others. Gudrid is also featured in Makoto Yukimura&#x27;s manga &quot;Vinland Saga&quot; which follows the story of Thorfinn Karlsefni and his journey to Vinland.

<text>In cryptography, SEAL (Software-Optimized Encryption Algorithm) is a stream cipher optimised for machines with a 32-bit word size and plenty of RAM with a reported performance of around 4 cycles per byte. SEAL is actually a pseudorandom function family in that it can easily generate arbitrary portions of the keystream without having to start from the beginning. This makes it particularly well suited for applications like encrypting hard drives.

The first version was published by Phillip Rogaway and Don Coppersmith in 1994. The current version, published in 1997, is 3.0. SEAL, covered by two patents in the United States, both of which are assigned to IBM.

<text>Alexander Claud Cockburn ( ; 6 June 1941 – 21 July 2012) was a Scottish-born Irish-American political journalist and writer. Cockburn was brought up by British parents in Ireland, but lived and worked in the United States from 1972. Together with Jeffrey St. Clair, he edited the political newsletter &quot;CounterPunch&quot;. Cockburn also wrote the &quot;Beat the Devil&quot; column for &quot;The Nation&quot;, and another column for &quot;The Week&quot; in London, syndicated by Creators Syndicate.

==Background==

Alexander Cockburn was born on June 6, 1941, in Scotland and grew up in Youghal, County Cork, Ireland. He was the eldest son of journalist, Claud Cockburn, a former Communist author, and his third wife, Patricia Byron, née Arbuthnot. (She wrote an autobiography, &quot;Figure of Eight&quot;). His ancestral family included Sir George Cockburn, 10th Baronet, who was responsible for the burning of Washington, DC in the War of 1812. His two younger brothers, Andrew Cockburn and Patrick, are also journalists. 

His half-sister, Sarah Caudwell, a barrister and mystery writer, died in 2000. His half-sister Claudia Cockburn and her husband Michael Flanders have two daughters, who are both journalists: Laura and Stephanie Flanders. Actress Olivia Wilde is the daughter of his brother Andrew. 

Cockburn grew up between his family home in Ireland and Glenalmond College, an independent boys&#x27; boarding school, in Perthshire, Scotland. He later studied English at Keble College, University of Oxford.

==Career==

===United Kingdom===
Cockburn graduated from Oxford in 1963, after which he worked at the &quot;New Left Review&quot;, becoming its managing editor in 1966. He was also assistant editor at the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, and in 1967 worked at &quot;New Statesman&quot;. In 1967 Cockburn co-edited &quot;The Incompatibles: Trade Union Militancy and the Consensus&quot; with Robin Blackburn. Blackburn described the book as &quot;[bringing] together trade-union organizers, leftwing journalists including Paul Foot, Marxist economists and two liberals—Michael Frayn and Philip Toynbee—who mocked the demonization of union activists by Labour as well as Conservative pundits.&quot; In 1969 the pair co-edited &quot;Student Power: Problems, Diagnosis, Action&quot;, with contributors including Herbert Marcuse, Perry Anderson, and Tom Nairn. In 1968, Cockburn published a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; supporting British socialists protesting the Vietnam War.

===United States===

Cockburn moved to the United States in 1972 and lived there for the rest of his years. He contributed pieces to &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and, from 1973 to 1983, &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. For the latter, he initiated the longstanding &quot;Press Clips&quot; column. His interview of Rupert Murdoch in &quot;The Voice&quot; preceded Murdoch&#x27;s purchase of the paper. James Ridgeway later noted that &quot;Murdoch, when he owned the &quot;Voice&quot;, was said to gag on some of Alex&#x27;s pointed epithets, but he never did anything about it.&quot; 

In 1975 Cockburn wrote &quot;Idle Passion: Chess and the Dance of Death.&quot; In 1979 Cockburn and Ridgeway co-wrote &quot;Political Ecology.&quot;

In 1982 Cockburn was suspended from &quot;The Voice&quot; for &quot;accepting a $10,000 grant from an Arab studies organization in 1982.&quot; In 1984, Cockburn became a regular contributor to &quot;The Nation&quot; with a column called &quot;Beat the Devil&quot;, titled for the novel of the same name written by his father. During the 1980s Cockburn also contributed to the &quot;New York Press&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, the &quot;Anderson Valley Advertiser&quot;, &quot;The Week&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;Chronicles&quot;.

In 1987, Cockburn completed the first of a series of books collecting columns, diary entries, letters, and essays dating from 1976, titled &quot;Corruptions of Empire&quot;; the cover featured a portrayal of Admiral George Cockburn torching the White House. Follow-up books included &quot;The Golden Age Is In Us: Journeys and Encounters&quot; (1995) and &quot;A Colossal Wreck: A Road Trip Through Political Scandal, Corruption, and American Culture&quot; (2013). 
In the 1990s Cockburn contributed to, and eventually became co-editor of, the newsletter &quot;CounterPunch&quot;.

Cockburn became a United States citizen in 2009. He lived in New York City for many years, before moving to Petrolia in Humboldt County in northern California in 1992.

==Political views and activities==
===Anti-war positions===
In a January 1980, &quot;Village Voice&quot; column, Cockburn criticized the US media&#x27;s coverage of the Soviet–Afghan War, and described Afghanistan as &quot;An unspeakable country filled with unspeakable people, sheepshaggers and smugglers ... I yield to none in my sympathy to those prostrate beneath the Russian jackboot, but if ever a country deserved rape it&#x27;s Afghanistan.&quot; Cockburn later said that his comments were &quot;satirical,&quot; &quot;tasteless,&quot; and that he &quot;shouldn&#x27;t have written it ... it was a joke.&quot;

The USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; fired a missile in 1988 that brought down Iran Air Flight 655, killing 290 people. With Ken Silverstein, in reaction the two men co-wrote articles critical of the United States military and its commanders. Cockburn also criticized economic and political sanctions imposed on the Iraqi government by the United Nations. He said that such policies targeted &quot;rogue states (most of which, like the Taliban or Saddam Hussein, started off as creatures of US intelligence).&quot; After the September 11 attacks, he criticized the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq by United States-led forces.

===Opposition to conspiracy theories===
Cockburn opposed conspiracism, particularly in regard to 9/11 conspiracy theories. He interpreted the rise of these ideas as a sign of the decline of the American Left. Cockburn also criticized conspiracy theories related to the 1963 assassination of US president Kennedy and the Country Walk case. He did suggest in writing that the US government had prior knowledge of the 1941 Japanese military attack on Pearl Harbor.

===Support of US constitutional rights===

Cockburn supported free speech, writing that &quot;Free speech counts most when it&#x27;s most risky&quot;. He said, &quot;America is well on its way to making it illegal to say anything nasty about gays, Jews, blacks and women [...] with the First Amendment gone the way of the dodo.&quot; Cockburn wrote approvingly of the right-wing Patriot movement and militia rallies.

Asked about his position on the Second Amendment and gun control, Cockburn once said, &quot;a native Mexican turkey wandered onto my property in Humboldt County, unaware that the California Fish and Game regulations permitted a window of vulnerability for the aforementioned wild turkey. I then proceeded to my 12-gauge and brought that turkey down, thirteen and a half pounds, plucked it, drew it, and ate it, with my loved ones as they say,&quot; but also said &quot;I think that people shouldn&#x27;t carry Howitzers.&quot; Following the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, Cockburn wrote, &quot;There have been the usual howls from the anti-gun lobby, but it&#x27;s all hot air. America is not about to dump the Second Amendment giving people the right to bear arms.&quot; He suggested several alternative measures to increased gun control around institutions of mandatory and elective education.

===Social topics===
Among other social topics, Cockburn wrote extensively about his opposition to “scaremongering” about illegal immigration to the United States, anti-Semitism and use of anti-Semitism accusations in modern politics (for which he received criticism), and his support of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Cockburn also wrote about same-sex marriage and Scientology.

==Personal life and death==

In December 1968, Cockburn married writer Emma Tennant; their daughter Daisy Alice Cockburn was born in February 1969. Cockburn and Tennant divorced in 1973. 

Cockburn had a complicated personal and professional relationship with British author and journalist Christopher Hitchens. Robin Blackburn commented that Cockburn “sort of invented Christopher. He showed him what could be done.&quot;

Cockburn died on 21 July 2012, in Bad Salzhausen, Germany, age 71, after suffering from cancer for two years. 

In &quot;CounterPunch&quot;, Jeffrey St. Clair wrote, &quot;[Cockburn] didn&#x27;t want the disease to define him. He didn&#x27;t want his friends and readers to shower him with sympathy. He didn&#x27;t want to blog his own death as Christopher Hitchens had done. Alex wanted to keep living his life right to the end.&quot;

<text>The  (, or &quot;People&#x27;s Guard&quot;) is the autonomous police force for the Basque Country, largely replacing the Spanish Policía Nacional (National Police) and Guardia Civil (Civil Guard). An Ertzaintza member is called an &quot;ertzaina&quot; ().

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The origins of the current Ertzaintza can be traced back to the old municipal militias, which were popular organizations at the service of local bodies, created to satisfy the need for public safety. But it was not until the 19th century when the almost permanent police corps of a professional nature were created.

It was a response to the banditry caused by the continuous social and political upheaval occurring from the end of the 18th century and well into the 19th. The decisive argument for its configuration was the First Carlist War, when the &quot;Miqueletes&quot; of Biscay and Guipuzcoa and the &quot;Miñones&quot; of Alava commenced their activities.

Once the urgencies of the war were overcome, the Spanish government attempted to recover the functions carried out by these regional forces and transfer them to the Civil Guard, which was created in 1844. Nevertheless, due to difficulties encountered when recruiting forces for this corps in the Basque provinces, plus the pressure posed by the other regional Governments, the very same regional forces were able to more or less carry on with their task.

=== After Carlist Wars ===
After the end of the Second Carlist War (1876), the Spanish government wished to curtail the regional autonomy. The Basque police forces had to adapt to this new centralist tendency, and these changes mostly manifested themselves in a reduction of personnel &amp; operational capabilities.
When the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed in 1931, political activity surged and so did the Basque claim to re-establish regional liberties that had been abolished in 1876. Thus, various projects for the Autonomy Statute were promoted.

On October 1, 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, the Basque Statute of Autonomy come into force, leading to the establishment of an autonomous government with actual authority over the provinces of Biscay and Guipuzcoa.
One of the priorities of the new government was the re-establishment of public order.

The Basque Interior Minister Telesforo Monzón set up several institutions, such as the International Police Force, the Maritime Police and the Public Order Body. Their main task was the creation of a police force named &quot;Ertzaña&quot; (a Basque neologism for &quot;People care&quot;), with 500 infantry and 400 motorised (&quot;Ertzañ Igiletua&quot;) men, totalling joint forces of around 1,200 agents.
Most of the British Riley Motor cars acquired for the motorised police did not arrive due to the Non-Intervention Pact. 
The majority of the Ertzaña were Basque speakers from the Basque Nationalist Party
Its headquarters were in Bilbao, at the Ibaigane Palace (currently the headquarters of Athletic Bilbao).

When the war on the Basque front concluded, the Ertzaña was dissolved, and Franco&#x27;s Nationalist regime pretended that this institution had never existed in the first place.

Having allied themselves with the losing Republican side, Biscay and Guipuzcoa were considered &quot;traitor provinces&quot; and most of their autonomy was annulled.
However, since at the outbreak of the civil war Alava and Navarre had thrown their lot in with the Nationalists, the &quot;Miñones&quot; and &quot;Miqueletes&quot; continued on duty, with assignments such as traffic patrols and custody of the regional institutions.

=== During transition ===

After the Spanish transition to democracy, the autonomous Basque Government was restored. Its government once again took up the spirit of the Ertzaña of 1936 to design, in 1980, the new autonomous police force of the Basque Country, the Ertzaintza (a more grammatical form). Previously, a Royal Decree re-established the &quot;Forales&quot; and the &quot;Miqueletes&quot; in Biscay and Guipuzcoa and gave a new configuration to the &quot;Miñones&quot; corps in Alava. These institutions were incorporated into the new Basque Police Force.

Navarre, during the events surrounding Spain&#x27;s 1978 Constitution, ended up with the status of Autonomous Community and was not lumped in with the Basque autonomous community, and its police force (Policía Foral) remains independent of the Ertzaintza.

===Officers===

The first officers were members of the Basque Nationalist Party. Although the law required that Ertzaintza commissioned officers had to be previous members of the Spanish army or the State police forces, this was often ignored.

This new police force, made up of Basque citizens, developed in an organized manner from 1982, and was progressively deployed starting from the countryside towards the cities.

Like many other Spanish Military and Police agencies Ertzaintza issues the H&amp;K USP Compact chambered in 9mm.

== Problems with ETA and controversies ==
Ertzaintza is not accepted by the Basque nationalist parties ETA and Batasuna, who deride it as &quot;zipaioak&quot;, or sepoys, an indigenous force serving the colonial power. As Ertzaintza took a more relevant role in the fight against ETA, it has become a target for them. It was soon infiltrated by ETA members, like Iñaki de Juana Chaos. In the areas where support for ETA is higher, &quot;ertzainas&quot; are forced to reside elsewhere and commute to work.
Fourteen ertzainas have been killed or injured by ETA, sometimes being specifically targeted.

The Spanish government has had reservations about Ertzaintza. Spanish parties have often accused the Basque Home Office (in most terms held by the Basque Nationalist Party) of being soft on the fight against ETA and its supporting party Batasuna. Two police officers of Ertzaintza said that the former nationalist government &quot;gave them orders not to act against ETA members and its social environment&quot;. Because of infiltration, Ertzaintza is not allowed by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior to access the Interpol intelligence network.
On 1 March 2010, Ertzaintza joined the Center for Police and Customs Cooperation in Hendaye, France, near the Spanish border.
It is a joint police station for information exchange with the French police.
The Spanish Civil Guard, the Spanish National Police Corps and the Customs Watch Services of the Spanish Tax Agency are also part of the center.

Lack of communication has occasionally led to shootings among police forces.

Some councillors of the Basque Country said that they have perceived a &quot;decrease of the pro-ETA menace because of the current important role of the Ertzaintza against terrorism&quot;.

== Etymology ==

 was a Basque neologism from (&quot;people&quot;) and (&quot;guard&quot;) created by the Nationalist poet Esteban Urkiaga .
The generic Basque word for &quot;police&quot; is .
Following the standardization of Basque in the 1960s, the name of the restored force became &quot;&quot; from the respelled and (compare with , &quot;shepherd&quot; from + ), with the suffix (compare , the Basque health service).
However to maintain a link to the past, the silent H was not included.
The Basque pop group (&quot;The policemen&quot;) chose their name prior to the re-establishment of the corps and applied the modern spelling rules.

<text>The Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra (; ), also known as the Policia de la Generalitat de Catalunya and informally as Mossos, is the autonomous police force in Catalonia. They trace their origins back to squads formed in 1719.

==History==
On 21 July 1950 the Deputation of Barcelona was authorised to create a small security force using the historical title &quot;Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra&quot;. These new Mossos were a militarized corps having little similarity to the earlier incarnations, with limited powers and small numbers, which was in charge of protecting the government buildings of the Province of Barcelona. With the return of democracy to Spain, the &quot;Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra&quot; grew in number and powers. Since 25 October 1980 the force has been under the authority of the Generalitat de Catalunya (the Government of Catalonia).

==Previous Catalan forces==

The , later known as the , (and informally known as the ), were men-at-arms who had fought as irregulars in the War of the Spanish Succession, and were brought together by the mayor of the town of Valls near Tarragona between 1719 and 1721. The corps was constituted as a militia to provide security to trade routes and fairs. It was created as a complement to the regular troops of the Bourbon army, which opposed the Miquelets, who survived as rebel supporters of Archduke Charles.

The Mossos was manned by local people, who had to speak Catalan and be familiar with local paths, caves, and hiding places. It was eventually placed under military jurisdiction, but was less centralised than the Spanish police force (then known as the &quot;Intendencia General de Policía&quot;) formed in 1817, or the yet-to-be-established &quot;Guardia Civil&quot;. Throughout the centuries, control of the Mossos passed back and forth several times from Catalan authority to Spanish military command. 

The Mossos were dissolved in 1868 by General Prim after the fall of Queen Isabella II of Spain, since the Mossos had always been royalists. They were reinstated in 1876 under the reign of Isabella&#x27;s son king Alfonso XII of Spain, but only in the province of Barcelona. Under his son Alfonso XIII of Spain, the Mossos were not well regarded in Catalonia, especially by the Commonwealth of Catalonia, who paid them but had no control over them. 

The Mossos flourished under Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorship; despite this, when the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, the Mossos sided with the Generalitat de Catalunya. After the Spanish Civil War, the last Mossos left Catalonia with the President of the Generalitat, and the corps was dissolved by the Francoist authorities.

==Current role==

The Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra have now replaced the Guardia Civil and National Police within the territory of Catalonia. This process of substitution began in 1994 and was completed in 2008.

The Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (Catalan: &quot;Estatut d&#x27;Autonomia de Catalunya&quot;) defines the scope of action of the Generalitat Police Force – Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra as the whole of the Catalan territory, and states that it exercises all the functions of a police force in the following fields:

* Public safety and public order
* Administrative policing, including that deriving from State regulations
* Judicial policing and criminal investigation, including the various forms of organised crime and terrorism, in the terms established by law
* Patrolling and ensuring the safety of highways within Catalonia

The Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra operate under the authority of the Generalitat de Catalunya within the territory of the autonomous community of Catalonia (through the Catalan Ministry of Home Affairs; Catalan: &quot;Departament d&#x27;Interior&quot;). The National Police and the Civil Guard, by contrast, are commanded directly by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. The Mossos keep some officers in Catalonia to support anti-terrorism operations, handle identity documents, police immigration, and execute other limited responsibilities of the central government. 

The sidearms officers can pick from are the Heckler &amp; Koch USP or the Walther P99 both of which are chambered for 9×19mm. Regular Mossos can also use the Heckler &amp; Koch UMP sub-machine gun, used by the Mossos during the 2017 Barcelona attacks.

The Mossos are trained in the &quot;Institut de Seguretat Pública de Catalunya&quot; (Public Safety Institute of Catalonia), which also trains local police officers.

==Special intervention group (GEI)==
The Special Intervention Group (GEI; in Catalan: &quot;Grup Especial d&#x27;Intervenció&quot;) is a Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra body that specializes in situations with a high risk of armed violence such as terrorist detention, rescues of hostages, and VIP protection. This group is under the command of the Intervention Division.

This group was created in 1984 with the collaboration of Spezialeinsatzkommando (SEK) of Germany. It was kept secret in anticipation of the security challenges that would be posed with the holding of the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992. Another rationale for its creation was to transfer responsibility for prisons to the Generalitat de Catalonia; this was felt to require a protocol to deal with riots or hostage-taking.

==Armament==
The force has a large quantity and variety of weapons. Each of the weapons is assigned only to one GEI.

==Vehicles==

* The Mossos employs several makes of vehicles, for both patrol and undercover operations. These vehicles are high-powered SUVs, vans, motorbikes and 4x4 vehicles. They also operate helicopters and drones for aerial operations.

== Controversies and legal cases ==
Controversies related to the Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra include:

* In 2008, three Mossos were sentenced to six years of imprisonment for the torture and injury of an alleged delinquent who was later proven not guilty. In 2009, the Tribunal Supremo reduced the sentence. In 2012, the offending Mossos were paroled.
* In 2016, six agents were detained for their involvement in a cardiac failure of a businessman in the Raval neighbourhood.
* In 2017, the central government suspended the Chief of Police Major Trapero during the 2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis, and also placed the force under investigation. The Mossos were eventually cleared of any wrongdoing and Trapero was reinstated.

<text>A twelve-string guitar (or 12-string guitar) is a steel-string guitar with 12 strings in six courses, which produces a thicker, more ringing tone than a standard six-string guitar. Typically, the strings of the lower four courses are tuned in octaves, with those of the upper two courses tuned in unison. The gap between the strings within each dual-string course is narrow, and the strings of each course are fretted and plucked as a single unit. The neck is wider, to accommodate the extra strings, and is similar to the width of a classical guitar neck. The sound, particularly on acoustic instruments, is fuller and more harmonically resonant than six-string instruments. The 12-string guitar can be played like a 6-string guitar as players still use the same notes, chords and guitar techniques like a standard 6-string guitar, but advanced techniques can be challenging as players need to play or pluck two strings simultaneously.

Structurally, 12-string guitars, especially those built before 1970, differ from six-string guitars in the following ways:
*The headstock is elongated to accommodate 12 tuning machines.
*The added tension of the six additional strings necessitates stronger reinforcement of the neck.
*The body is also reinforced, and built with a stronger structure, to withstand the higher tension.
*The fretting scale is generally shorter to reduce the overall string tension.

Twelve-string guitars are made in both acoustic and electric forms. However, the acoustic type is more common.

==&quot;Chorus&quot; effect==

The double ranks of strings of the 12-string guitar produce a shimmering effect, because even the strings tuned in unison can never vibrate with precise simultaneity—that is, they vibrate out of phase. The result to the ear is a sound that seems to &quot;shimmer&quot;, which some describe as resembling strings that are slightly detuned. The interference between the out-of-phase vibrations produces a phenomenon known as a beat that results in a periodic rise and fall of intensity which is, in music, often considered pleasing to the ear. Pete Seeger described the distinctive sound of the 12-string guitar as &quot;the clanging of bells.&quot;

==Origin and history==
The origin of the modern 12-string guitar is not clear, but it arose in the closing years of the 19th century. The most likely ancestors using courses of doubled strings are some Mexican instruments of Spanish ancestry such as the &quot;bandolón&quot;, the &quot;guitarra séptima,&quot; the &quot;guitarra quinta huapanguera,&quot; and the &quot;bajo sexto.&quot; Pictures such as the 1901 &quot;Mexican Typical Orchestra&quot; at the Pan-American Exposition show a guitar with 12 strings. At the end of the 19th century, the archtop mandolin was one of the first instruments with courses of doubled strings designed in the United States.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, 12-strings were regarded as &quot;novelty&quot; instruments. The 12-string guitar did not become a major part of blues and folk music till the 1920s and the 1930s, when their &quot;larger than life&quot; sound made them ideal as solo accompaniment for vocalists, especially Lead Belly and Blind Willie McTell. The 12-string guitar has since occupied roles in certain varieties of folk, rock, jazz, and popular music. In the 1930s, Mexican-American guitarist and singer Lydia Mendoza popularized the instrument. In the 1950s, Lead Belly&#x27;s protégé, Fred Gerlach, brought the instrument into the American folk music world. Initially, it was primarily used for accompaniment, owing to the greater difficulty of picking or executing string &quot;bends&quot; on its double-strung courses. The Delta Blues guitar virtuoso Robert Lockwood Jr was presented a handcrafted acoustic 12-string guitar made by an outstanding Japanese luthier in the end of the sixties, and this became the instrument of choice for Lockwood thereafter. In the later 20th century, however, a number of players devoted themselves to producing solo performances on the 12-string guitar, including Leo Kottke, Peter Lang, John McLaughlin, Larry Coryell, Ralph Towner, Robbie Basho, Roger Whittaker, Jack Rose, and James Blackshaw.

===Electric 12-string guitars===

Electric 12-strings became a staple in pop and rock music in the 1960s. Early use of the instrument was pioneered by the guitarists of The Wrecking Crew; in 1963, Carol Kaye used a converted Guild six-string on The Crystals&#x27; hit &quot;Then He Kissed Me,&quot; and on Jackie DeShannon&#x27;s song &quot;When You Walk in the Room,&quot; Glen Campbell played a well-known guitar figure, composed by DeShannon, on an electric 12-string.

One of the first mass-produced electric 12-strings was the Bellzouki. Introduced by Danelectro in 1961, from a design by session guitarist Vinnie Bell, it was initially considered a cross between an electric guitar and a bouzouki rather than an electric version of the traditional 12-string guitar. In the UK in 1963, JMI briefly produced the Vox Bouzouki, later produced in Italy as The Vox Tempest XII, which was used by Vic Flick on the Peter and Gordon hit single &quot;A World Without Love&quot; in 1964. In late 1963, Burns developed the Double Six, supplying a prototype to Hank Marvin of The Shadows, who used it on a number of songs for the soundtrack of the 1964 Cliff Richard movie &quot;Wonderful Life;&quot; the Double Six was also used on The Searchers&#x27; cover version of De Shannon&#x27;s &quot;When You Walk in the Room.&quot;

The electric 12-string gained prominence with the introduction in 1964 of the Rickenbacker 360, made famous through George Harrison&#x27;s use of it on The Beatles&#x27; album &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and many subsequent recordings. In 1965, inspired by Harrison, Roger McGuinn made the Rickenbacker 12-string central to The Byrds&#x27; folk rock sound, further popularising the instrument. 
By the mid-1960s, most major guitar manufacturers were producing competing instruments, including the Fender Electric XII (used by Roy Wood of The Move), and the Vox Phantom XII (used by Tony Hicks of The Hollies). Gretsch, Guild, and Gibson also produced electric 12-string models from the mid-Sixties and following decades, with Gretsch promoting theirs by supplying a number of custom made 12-strings for The Monkees guitarist Michael Nesmith, for use on &quot;The Monkees&quot; TV series.
Standard electric 12-strings became less popular with the end of the American folk rock scene in the late sixties; Fender and Gibson ceased production of the Electric XII and ES-335 12-string variant respectively, in 1969. However, from the 1970s, some progressive rock, hard rock, and jazz fusion guitarists, most notably Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Don Felder of the Eagles, John McLaughlin of The Mahavishnu Orchestra and Alex Lifeson of Rush used double-necked guitars such as the Gibson EDS-1275, with six-string and 12-string necks, for live appearances, allowing easy transition between different sounds mid-song.

The post punk era of the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s saw a resurgence of electric 12-string guitar use among &#x27;60s-influenced alternative rock, pop, and indie guitarists. Players such as Johnny Marr of The Smiths, Dave Gregory of XTC, Susanna Hoffs of The Bangles, Marty Willson-Piper of The Church, Peter Buck of R.E.M., and Tom Petty and Mike Campbell of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers often chose 12-strings (particularly Rickenbackers) for many songs.

In the 1980s John C Hall, president of Rickenbacker, invited Roger McGuinn to participate in a limited-edition signature model. McGuinn was delighted. Roger McGuinn&#x27;s signature model Rickenbacker 12-string was introduced in 1988 as the 370/12 RME1.

==Design==
The strings are placed in courses of two strings each that are usually played together. The two strings in each of the lower four courses are normally tuned an octave apart, while each pair of strings in the top two courses are tuned in unison. The strings are generally arranged such that the higher string of each pair is struck first on a downward strum. However, Rickenbacker usually reverses this arrangement on its electric 12-string guitars. The tuning of the second string in the third course (G) varies. Some players use a unison string, while most prefer the distinctive high-pitched, bell-like quality an octave string makes in this position. Another common variant is to tune the octave string in the sixth (lowest) course &quot;two&quot; octaves above the lower string, rather than one. Some players, either in search of distinctive tone or for ease of playing, remove some doubled strings. For example, removing the higher octave from the three bass courses simplifies playing running bass lines, but keeps the extra treble strings for the full strums. Some manufacturers have produced 9-string instruments based on this setup, in which either the lower three courses are singular, or the upper three courses are singular. Additionally; some players adapted more unconventional stringing: for example, Big Joe Williams used doubled strings on the 1st, 2nd and 4th courses of his guitars; at first adapted six-string instruments and into the sixties and later usually adapted 12-strings.

The extra tension placed on the instrument by the doubled strings is high, and because of this additional stress on their necks and soundboards, 12-string guitars long had a reputation for warping after a few years of use. (This is less of a problem in modern instruments, built after 1970.) Until the wide spread adoption by American makers of the truss rod after WWII, 12-string guitars were frequently tuned lower than the traditional EADGBE to reduce the stresses on the instrument. For example, Lead Belly often used a low-C tuning, but in some recordings, his tunings can be recognized as low-B and A tunings, partially due to the unusually long scale length (~26.5-27&quot;) of the particular models of guitar that he preferred in combination with the heavy strings that were commonly available (14-70). Some 12-string guitars have nontraditional structural supports to prevent or postpone warping, at the expense of appearance and tone. To additionally reduce string tension, 12-string guitars built prior to 1970 typically had shorter necks and scale lengths than six-string guitars, which made frets more closely spaced, with some notable exceptions such as the instruments made by the Oscar Schmidt company before their bankruptcy, which usually had scale lengths of around 26.5&quot;. Their bridges, especially in acoustic guitars, had a larger reinforcement plate for the same reason, and tailpiece and floating-bridge setups were far more common than on six string instruments as another way to combat the effect of the high tension.

Advances in materials, design, and construction in such guitars made after 1970 have eliminated most of these accommodations. Contemporary 12 string guitars are commonly built to the same dimensions and scale as their six-string counterparts, albeit still usually with heavier build and bracing.

==Tuning==

The most common tuning, considered standard today, is a variation on the standard six-string guitar tuning: , moving from lowest (sixth) course to highest (first) course. Lead Belly and some other players have doubled the lowest course two octaves above instead of one, producing a third string in unison with the top course, and some stringing the third course in unison as well, and some others all courses except the top in octaves.

Some performers use open tunings and other non-standard guitar tunings on 12-string guitars. Some performers have experimented with tuning the two strings within a course to intervals other than octaves or unisons: jazz guitarists such as Ralph Towner (of Oregon), Larry Coryell, and Philip Catherine have tuned the bass courses of their 12-string guitars to the upper fifths and trebles to the lower fourths instead of octaves and unisons; Michael Gulezian tuned strings in the top two courses to whole-tone intervals (and possibly some of the other strings an octave lower) to achieve a very rich, complex sound. The greater number of strings offers almost endless possibilities.

===Nashville tuning===
Nashville Tuning is a way of simulating a 12-string guitar sound, using two six-string guitars playing in unison. This is achieved by replacing the lower four courses on one six-string with the higher octave strings for those four courses from a 12-string set, and tuning these four strings an octave higher than normal tuning for those courses on a six-string. Double-tracking this guitar with the standard-tuned six-string is commonly used in recording studios to achieve a &quot;cleaner&quot; 12-string effect.

===Mexican 12-String tuning===
Mexican 12-String, also known as requinto style or Sierreño style, are modified 12-string guitars that can approximate the sound of a bajo sexto or bajo quinto and play regional Mexican styles, such as norteño (music of Northern Mexico), Tejano (Tex-Mex), and conjunto (música mexicana-tejana). In a traditional 12-string setup, the lower four strings (E, A, D, and G) have octave pairs, while the top two (B and E) have unison pairs. However, for Regional Mexican styles, all strings are set up with identical unison pairs instead of the traditional octave courses. This configuration yields a resonant timbre reminiscent of the venerable bajo sexto, but adds significantly more tension on the bridge and neck. Furthermore, it usually requires the nut to be modified, the neck compensated, and the bridge to be reinforced.

==Playing==
The 12-string guitar&#x27;s greater number of strings and higher cumulative string tension complicates playing, in both hands. Fretting chords requires greater force, and the width of the neck and the added string tension combine to make soloing and string-bending challenging. The gap between the dual-string courses is usually narrower than that between the single-string courses of a conventional six-string guitar, so more precision is required with the pick or fingertip when not simply strumming chords. Consequently, the instrument is most commonly used for accompaniment, though several players have taken the time to develop the 12-string guitar as a solo instrument. Flat-picking solos are more frequently seen with electric players, whereas a few acoustic players, such as Leo Kottke, have adapted fingerstyle techniques to the instrument; players such as Ralph Towner have applied classical playing techniques. 

Roger McGuinn developed his own style of playing a 12-string guitar. The neck of a Rickenbacker 360/12 12-string guitar is as wide as the 6-string guitar. Solos are therefore easier to play and he used his banjo techniques to play chords. In addition to applying a compressor, this determined the sound of The Byrds. Lead Belly adapted both the traditional, simple strum style and the finger-style method that was becoming popular at the time as well; Blind Willie McTell also played finger-style 12 string.

<text>A rebreather is a breathing apparatus that absorbs the carbon dioxide of a user&#x27;s exhaled breath to permit the rebreathing (recycling) of the substantial unused oxygen content, and unused inert content when present, of each breath. Oxygen is added to replenish the amount metabolised by the user. This differs from open-circuit breathing apparatus, where the exhaled gas is discharged directly into the environment. The purpose is to extend the breathing endurance of a limited gas supply, while also eliminating the bubbles otherwise produced by an open circuit system. The latter advantage over other systems is useful for covert military operations by frogmen, as well as for undisturbed observation of underwater wildlife. A rebreather is generally understood to be a portable apparatus carried by the user. The same technology on a vehicle or non-mobile installation is more likely to be referred to as a life-support system.

Rebreather technology may be used where breathing gas supply is limited, such as underwater, in space, where the environment is toxic or hypoxic (as in firefighting), mine rescue, high-altitude operations, or where the breathing gas is specially enriched or contains expensive components, such as helium diluent or anaesthetic gases.

Rebreathers are used in many environments: underwater, diving rebreathers are a type of self-contained underwater breathing apparatus which have provisions for both a primary and emergency gas supply. On land they are used in industrial applications where poisonous gases may be present or oxygen may be absent, firefighting, where firefighters may be required to operate in an atmosphere immediately dangerous to life and health for extended periods, in hospital anaesthesia breathing systems to supply controlled concentrations of anaesthetic gases to patients without contaminating the air that the staff breathe, and at high altitude, where the partial pressure of oxygen is low, for high altitude mountaineering. In aerospace there are applications in unpressurised aircraft and for high altitude parachute drops, and above the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, in space suits for extra-vehicular activity. Similar technology is used in life-support systems in submarines, submersibles, atmospheric diving suits, underwater and surface saturation habitats, spacecraft, and space stations, and in gas reclaim systems used to recover the large volumes of helium used in saturation diving.

The recycling of breathing gas comes at the cost of technological complexity and specific hazards, some of which depend on the application and type of rebreather used. Mass and bulk may be greater or less than open circuit depending on circumstances. Electronically controlled diving rebreathers may automatically maintain a partial pressure of oxygen between programmable upper and lower limits, or set points, and be integrated with decompression computers to monitor the decompression status of the diver and record the dive profile.

==General concept==
As a person breathes, the body consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Base metabolism requires about 0.25 L/min of oxygen from a breathing rate of about 6 L/min, and a fit person working hard may ventilate at a rate of 95 L/min but will only metabolise about 4 L/min of oxygen. The oxygen metabolised is generally about 4% to 5% of the inspired volume at normal atmospheric pressure, or about 20% of the available oxygen in the air at sea level. Exhaled air at sea level contains roughly 13.5% to 16% oxygen.

The situation is even more wasteful of oxygen when the oxygen fraction of the breathing gas is higher, and in underwater diving, the compression of breathing gas due to depth makes the recirculation of exhaled gas even more desirable, as an even larger proportion of open circuit gas is wasted. Continued rebreathing of the same gas will deplete the oxygen to a level which will no longer support consciousness, and eventually life, so gas containing oxygen must be added to the breathing gas to maintain the required concentration of oxygen.

However, if this is done without removing the carbon dioxide, it will rapidly build up in the recycled gas, resulting almost immediately in mild respiratory distress, and rapidly developing into further stages of hypercapnia, or carbon dioxide toxicity. 
A high ventilation rate is usually necessary to eliminate the metabolic product carbon dioxide (CO2). The breathing reflex is triggered by CO2 concentration in the blood, not by the oxygen concentration, so even a small buildup of CO2 in the inhaled gas quickly becomes intolerable; if a person tries to directly rebreathe their exhaled breathing gas, they will soon feel an acute sense of suffocation, so rebreathers must remove the CO2 in a component known as a carbon dioxide scrubber.

By adding sufficient oxygen to compensate for the metabolic usage, removing the carbon dioxide, and rebreathing the gas, most of the volume is conserved.

===Endurance===

The endurance of a rebreather, the duration for which it can be safely and comfortably used, is dependent on the oxygen supply at the oxygen consumption rate of the user, and the capacity of the scrubber to remove carbon dioxide at the rate it is produced by the user. These variables are closely linked, as the carbon dioxide is a product of metabolic oxygen consumption, though not the only product. This is independent of depth, except for work of breathing increase due to gas density increase.

==Architecture==

There are two basic arrangements controlling the flow of breathing gas inside the rebreather, known as the pendulum and loop systems.

===Pendulum===

In the pendulum configuration, the user inhales gas from the counterlung through a breathing hose, and exhaled gas returns to the counterlung by flowing back through the same hose. The scrubber is usually between the breathing hose and the counterlung bag, and gas flow is bi-directional. All of the flow passages between the user and the active absorbent in the scrubber are dead space – volume containing gas which is rebreathed without modification by the rebreather. The dead space increases as the absorbent is depleted. Breathing hose volume must be minimised to limit dead space.

===Loop===

In the loop configuration, the user inhales gas through one hose, and exhales through a second hose. Exhaled gas flows into the scrubber from one side, and exits at the other side. There may be one large counterlung, on either side of the scrubber, or two smaller counterlungs, one on each side of the scrubber. Flow is in one direction, enforced by non-return valves, which are usually in the breathing hoses where they join the mouthpiece. Only the flow passage in the mouthpiece before the split between inhalation and exhalation hoses is dead space, and this is not affected by hose volume.

==Components==
There are some components that are common to almost all personal portable rebreathers. These include the ambient pressure breathing volume components, usually called the breathing loop in a circulating flow rebreather, and the make-up gas supply and control system.

===Counterlung===
The counterlung is an airtight bag of strong flexible material that holds the volume of the exhaled gas until it is inhaled again. There may be a single counterlung, or one on each side of the scrubber, which allows a more even flow rate of gas through the scrubber, which can reduce work of breathing and improve scrubber efficiency by a more consistent .

===Scrubber===
The scrubber is a container filled with carbon dioxide absorbent material, mostly strong bases, through which the exhaled gas passes to remove the carbon dioxide. The absorbent may be granular or in the form of a moulded cartridge. Granular absorbent may be manufactured by breaking up lumps of lime and sorting the granules by size, or by moulding granules at a consistent size and shape. Gas flow through the scrubber may be in one direction in a loop rebreather, or both ways in a pendulum rebreather. The scrubber canister generally has an inlet on one side and an outlet on the other side.

A typical absorbent is soda lime, which is made up of calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2, and sodium hydroxide NaOH. The main component of soda lime is calcium hydroxide, which is relatively cheap and easily available. Other components may be present in the absorbent. Sodium hydroxide is added to accelerate the reaction with carbon dioxide. Other chemicals may be added to prevent unwanted decomposition products when used with standard halogenated inhalation anaesthetics. An indicator may be included to show when carbon dioxide has dissolved in the water of the soda lime and formed carbonic acid, changing the pH from basic to acid, as the change of colour shows that the absorbent has reached saturation with carbon dioxide and must be changed.

The carbon dioxide combines with water or water vapor to produce a weak carbonic acid: CO2 + H2O –&gt; H2CO3. This reacts with the hydroxides to produce carbonates and water in an exothermic reaction. In the intermediate reaction, the carbonic acid reacts exothermically with sodium hydroxide to form sodium carbonate and water: H2CO3 + 2NaOH –&gt; Na2CO3 + 2H2O + heat. In the final reaction, the sodium carbonate reacts with the slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) to form calcium carbonate and sodium hydroxide: Na2CO3 + Ca(OH)2 –&gt; CaCO3 + 2NaOH. The sodium hydroxide is then available again to react with more carbonic acid. of this absorbent can remove about of carbon dioxide at standard atmospheric pressure. This process also heats and humidifies the air, which is desirable for diving in cold water, or climbing at high altitudes, but not for working in hot environments.

Other reactions may be used in special circumstances. Lithium hydroxide and particularly lithium peroxide may be used where low mass is important, such as in space stations and space suits. Lithium peroxide also replenishes the oxygen during the scrubbing reaction.

Another method of carbon dioxide removal occasionally used in portable rebreathers is to freeze it out, which is possible in a cryogenic rebreather which uses liquid oxygen. The liquid oxygen absorbs heat from the carbon dioxide in a heat exchanger to convert the oxygen to gas, which is sufficient to freeze the carbon dioxide. This process also chills the gas, which is sometimes, but not always, desirable.

===Breathing hoses===

A breathing hose or sometimes &quot;breathing tube&quot; on a rebreather is a flexible tube for breathing gas to pass through at ambient pressure. They are distinguished from the low-, intermediate-, and high-pressure hoses which may also be parts of rebreather apparatus. They have a wide enough bore to minimise flow resistance at the ambient pressure in the operational range for the equipment, are usually circular in cross section, and may be corrugated to let the user&#x27;s head move about without the tube collapsing at kinks.

Each end has an airtight connection to the adjacent component, and they may contain a one-way valve to keep the gas circulating the right way in a loop system. Depending on the service, they may be made of a flexible polymer, an elastomer, a fibre or cloth reinforced elastomer, or elastomer covered with a woven fabric for reinforcement or abrasion resistance. If the woven layer is bonded to the outside surface it protects the rubber from damage from scrapes but makes it more difficult to wash off contaminants. Breathing hoses typically come in two types of corrugation. Annular corrugations, as depicted in the photo, benefit from easier field repair if a tear or hole while helical corrugations allow efficient drainage after cleaning.

Breathing hoses are usually long enough to connect the apparatus to the user&#x27;s head in all attitudes of their head, but should not be unnecessarily long, which will cause additional weight, hydrodynamic drag, risk snagging on things, or contain excess dead space in a pendulum rebreather. Breathing hoses can be tethered down to a diver&#x27;s shoulders or ballasted for neutral buoyancy to minimise loads on the mouthpiece.

===Mouthpiece or facemask===
A mouthpiece with bite-grip, an oro-nasal mask, a full-face mask, or a sealed helmet is provided so that the user can breathe from the unit hands-free.

===Oxygen supply===
A store of oxygen, usually as compressed gas in a high pressure cylinder, but sometimes as liquid oxygen, that feeds gaseous oxygen into the ambient pressure breathing volume, either continuously, or when the user operates the oxygen addition valve, or via a demand valve in an oxygen rebreather, when the volume of gas in the breathing circuit becomes low and the pressure drops, or in an electronically controlled mixed gas rebreather, after a sensor has detected insufficient oxygen partial pressure, and activates a solenoid valve.

===Valves===
Valves are needed to control gas flow in the breathing volume, and gas feed from the storage container. They include:
* Non-return valves in the breathing loop of loop rebreathers, which enforce one-directional flow to minimise dead space,
* Dive/surface valves on diving rebreathers, which prevent water from entering the breathing volume when the mouthpiece is removed, or the user elects to breathe ambient air at the surface.
* Gas supply valves, including a cylinder valve, to allow high pressure gas to flow from the cylinder. This may be manually operated by the user to directly supply make-up gas, or may provide the gas to a pressure regulator which reduces the pressure to a few bar above ambient pressure, and supplies this intermediate pressure gas to the gas feed system, which may contain one or more of:
** Manually operated feed valve,
** Constant mass flow orifice or needle valve, to provide a continuous feed,
** Demand valve which automatically adds gas when the volume of the counterlung(s) is too low, and pressure in the breathing volume drops below ambient pressure.
* Overpressure valve, to release excess gas. This is mainly used in diving rebreathers to compensate for expansion during ascent. Excess gas may also be vented past the skirt seal of a full-face mask, or through the nose when a mouthpiece is used.

===Oxygen sensors===

Oxygen sensors may be used to monitor partial pressure of oxygen in mixed gas rebreathers to ensure that it does not fall outside the safe limits, but are generally not used on oxygen rebreathers, as the oxygen content is fixed at 100%, and its partial pressure varies only with the ambient pressure.

==System variants==
Re breathers can be primarily categorised as diving rebreathers, intended for hyperbaric use, and other rebreathers used at pressures from slightly more than normal atmospheric pressure at sea level to significantly lower ambient pressure at high altitudes and in space. Diving rebreathers must often deal with the complications of avoiding hyperbaric oxygen toxicity, while normobaric and hypobaric applications can use the relatively trivially simple oxygen rebreather technology, where there is no requirement to monitor oxygen partial pressure during use providing the ambient pressure is sufficient.

Rebreathers can also be subdivided by functional principle as closed circuit and semi-closed circuit rebreathers.
*: A closed circuit rebreather adds oxygen to the loop gas to make up for oxygen used by metabolic processes. These processes do not use diluent gas, so none is added unless the volume of the loop is reduced for other reasons, such as intentional dumping, flushing, or an ambient pressure change. Gas is dumped from the loop when it expands during a pressure reduction, or too much is added.
*, also known as a gas extender: A semi-closed circuit rebreather either dumps some loop gas nearly constantly or constantly adds gas to the loop, and consequently needs an inflow of both diluent and oxygen to make up the volume. Changes in ambient pressure also require changes in the number (mass) of gas in the loop to maintain the working volume.

===Oxygen rebreathers===

This is the earliest type of rebreather and was commonly used by navies for submarine escape and shallow water diving work, for mine rescue, high altitude mountaineering and flight, and in industrial applications from the early twentieth century. Oxygen rebreathers can be remarkably simple and mechanically reliable, and they were invented before open-circuit scuba. They only supply oxygen, so there is no requirement to control the gas composition other than removing the carbon dioxide.

====Oxygen feed options====

In some rebreathers the oxygen cylinder has oxygen supply mechanisms in parallel. One is constant flow; the other is a manual on-off valve called a bypass valve; both feed into the same hose which feeds the counterlung. Others are supplied via a demand valve on the counterlung. This will add gas at any time that the counterlung is emptied and the diver continues to inhale. Oxygen can also be added manually by a button which activates the demand valve. Some simple oxygen rebreathers had no automatic supply system, but only the manual feed valve, and the diver had to operate the valve at intervals to refill the breathing bag as the volume of oxygen decreased below a comfortable level.

===Mixed gas rebreathers===

All rebreathers other than oxygen rebreathers may be considered mixed gas rebreathers, as the breathing gas is a mixture of oxygen and metabolically inactive diluent gas. These can be divided into semi-closed circuit, where the supply gas is a breathable mixture containing oxygen and inert diluents, usually nitrogen and helium, and which is replenished by adding more of the mixture as the oxygen is used up, sufficient to maintain a breathable partial pressure of oxygen in the loop, and closed circuit rebreathers, where two parallel gas supplies are used: the diluent, to provide the bulk of the gas, and which is recycled, and oxygen, which is metabolically expended. Carbon dioxide is considered a waste product, and in a correctly functioning rebreather, is effectively removed when the gas passes through the scrubber.

===Rebreathers using an absorbent that releases oxygen===
There have been a few rebreather designs (e.g. the Oxylite) which use potassium superoxide, which gives off oxygen as it absorbs carbon dioxide, as the carbon dioxide absorbent: 4KO2 + 2CO2 = 2K2CO3 + 3O2. A small volume oxygen cylinder is needed to fill and purge the loop at the start of use. This technology may be applied to both oxygen and mixed gas rebreathers, and can be used for diving and other applications. Potassium superoxide reacts vigorously with liquid water, releasing considerable heat and oxygen, and causing a fire hazard, so the more successful applications have been for space-suits, fire-fighting and mine rescue.

=== Rebreathers which use liquid oxygen ===
A liquid oxygen supply can be used for oxygen or mixed gas rebreathers. If used underwater, the liquid-oxygen container must be well insulated against heat transfer from the water. Industrial sets of this type may not be suitable for diving, and diving sets of this type may not be suitable for use out of water due to conflicting heat transfer requirements. The set&#x27;s liquid oxygen tank must be filled immediately before use. Examples of the type include:
* Blackett&#x27;s Aerophor
* Aerorlox

==== Cryogenic rebreather ====

A cryogenic rebreather removes the carbon dioxide by freezing it out in a &quot;snow box&quot; by the low temperature produced as liquid oxygen evaporates to replace the oxygen used.

==Fields of application==

*Underwater – as a self-contained breathing apparatus, where it is sometimes known as &quot;closed circuit scuba&quot; as opposed to &quot;open circuit scuba&quot; where the diver exhales breathing gas into the surrounding water. Surface-supplied diving equipment may incorporate rebreather technology either as a gas reclaim system, where the surface-supplied breathing gas is returned and scrubbed at the surface, or as a carried by the diver. Rebreathers may also be used as self-contained diver bailout systems for either scuba or surface-supplied diving.
*Mine rescue and other industrial applications – where poisonous gases may be present or oxygen may be absent.
*Fire fighting, where personnel may be required to operate in an atmosphere immediately dangerous to life and health for longer periods than open-circuit Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) can provide air.
*Crewed spacecraft and space suits – outer space is, effectively, a vacuum without oxygen to support life.
*Himalayan or high-altitude mountaineering. High altitude reduces the partial pressure of oxygen in the ambient air, which reduces the ability of the climber to function effectively. Mountaineering rebreathers are closed-circuit oxygen sets that provide a higher partial pressure of oxygen to the climber than the ambient air.
*Medical anaesthesia breathing systems – to supply controlled concentrations of anaesthetic gases to patients without contaminating the air that the staff breathe, and to conserve anaesthetic gas.
*Life-support systems of submarines, underwater habitats, and saturation diving systems use a scrubber system working on the same principles as a rebreather.

This may be compared with some applications of open-circuit breathing apparatus:
*The oxygen enrichment systems primarily used by medical patients, high altitude mountaineers and commercial aircraft emergency systems, in which the user breathes ambient air which is enriched by the addition of pure oxygen,
*Open circuit breathing apparatus used by firefighters, underwater divers and some mountaineers, which supplies fresh gas for each breath, which is then discharged into the environment.
*Gas masks and respirators which filter contaminants from ambient air which is then breathed.

===Diving rebreathers===
The widest variety of rebreather types is used in diving, as the consequences of breathing under pressure complicate the requirements, and a large range of options are available depending on the specific application and available budget. A diving rebreather is safety-critical life-support equipment – some modes of failure can kill the diver without warning, others can require immediate appropriate response for survival.

==== Surface supplied diving gas reclaim systems ====

A helium reclaim system (or push-pull system) is used to recover helium based breathing gas after use by the diver when this is more economical than losing it to the environment in open circuit systems. The recovered gas is passed through a scrubber system to remove carbon dioxide, filtered to remove odours, and pressurised into storage containers, where it may be mixed with oxygen to the required composition for re-use, either immediately, or at a later date.

==== Saturation diving life-support systems ====

The life support system provides breathing gas and other services to support life for the personnel under pressure in the accommodation chambers and closed diving bell. It includes the following components:
*Breathing gas supply, distribution and recycling equipment: scrubbers, filters, boosters, compressors, mixing, monitoring, and storage facilities
*Chamber climate control system – control of temperature and humidity, and filtration of gas
*Instrumentation, control, monitoring and communications equipment
*Fire suppression systems
*Sanitation systems

The life support system for the bell provides and monitors the main supply of breathing gas, and the control station monitors the deployment and communications with the divers. Primary gas supply, power and communications to the bell are through a bell umbilical, made up from a number of hoses and electrical cables twisted together and deployed as a unit. This is extended to the divers through the diver umbilicals.

The accommodation life support system maintains the chamber environment within the acceptable range for health and comfort of the occupants. Temperature, humidity, breathing gas quality, sanitation systems, and equipment function are monitored and controlled.

===Atmospheric diving suits===
An atmospheric diving suit is a small one-man articulated submersible of roughly anthropomorphic form, with limb joints which allow articulation under external pressure while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. Breathing gas supply may be surface supplied by umbilical, or from a rebreather carried on the suit. An emergency gas supply rebreather may also be fitted to a suit with either surface supply or rebreather for primary breathing gas. As the internal pressure is maintained at one atmosphere, there is no risk of acute oxygen toxicity. This is an underwater diving application, but has more in common with industrial applications than with ambient pressure scuba rebreathers.

===Industrial and rescue self-contained rebreathers===

Different design criteria apply to SCBA rebreathers for use only out of the water:
*There is no variation in ambient pressure on the components. The counterlung may be placed for comfort and convenience.
*Cooling of the gas in the breathing loop may be desirable, as the absorbent produces heat as it reacts with carbon dioxide, and the warming of the gas is not welcome in hot industrial situations such as firefighting and deep mines.
*Absorbent containers may in some cases rely on gravity for preventing channeling.
*If a full-face mask is used, it may have viewports designed for convenience or improved field of vision, and they do not need to be flat and parallel to prevent visual distortion as when underwater.
*In firefighting rebreathers, consideration must be given to making the set reasonably flame-proof and protecting it from heat and debris impacts.
*The need to ditch the set quickly may not arise, and harness straps may not need a quick-release.
*Buoyancy is not a consideration, but weight may be critical. Good ergonomic design for ease of carrying, comfort, and balance are important where the unit may be worn in confined spaces, while climbing and crawling through small gaps.
*A spring loaded counterlung pressurisation system may be used to provide slight positive pressure in the breathing loop, to prevent noxious gas entry if the mask seal is not perfect.
*There are no constraints due to the physiological effects of breathing under pressure. Complex gas mixtures are unnecessary. Oxygen rebreathers can usually be used, which makes the design considerably simpler, and the mechanism more reliable.
*A system allowing the user to access drinking water from a bag may be fitted, A bite operated valve van be used to control flow.
*Radio voice communications may be fitted.
*A constant mass flow system may be used to ensure a minimum fresh gas supply, with a demand valve to add gas if the loop is emptied.
*Gas supply and absorbent duration would usually be matched for efficiency 
*Insulation may be needed for the breathing loop for use in sub-zero temperatures where freezing of the absorbent would reduce its effectiveness.
*A water trap may be provided to collect condensed water from the absorbent reaction and from metabolic product.
*Monitoring functions may include:
**Cylinder pressure (analog and digital)
**Estimated remaining duration of use until residual low pressure warning is activated
**Temperature indication
**Automatic recording of warning signals
*Optical and/or acoustic warning signals may be provided for:
**Low gas pressure in the cylinder
**Alarm triggered by lack of user movement
**Manually triggered alarm.

===Mountaineering rebreathers===
Mountaineering rebreathers provide oxygen at a higher concentration than available from atmospheric air in a naturally hypoxic environment. They need to be lightweight and to be reliable in severe cold including not getting choked with deposited frost. A high rate of system failures due to extreme cold has not been solved. Breathing pure oxygen results in an elevated partial pressure of oxygen in the blood: a climber breathing pure oxygen at the summit of Mount Everest has a greater oxygen partial pressure than breathing air at sea level. This results in being able to exert greater physical effort at altitude. The exothermic reaction helps keep the scrubber contents from freezing, and helps reduce heat loss from the user.

Both chemical and compressed gas oxygen have been used in experimental closed-circuit oxygen systems – the first on Mount Everest in 1938. The 1953 expedition used closed-circuit oxygen equipment developed by Tom Bourdillon and his father for the first assault team of Bourdillon and Evans; with one &quot;dural&quot; 800l compressed oxygen cylinder and soda lime canister (the second (successful) assault team of Hillary and Tenzing used open-circuit equipment).

===Rebreathers for unpressurised aircraft and high altitude parachuting===
Similar requirement and working environment to mountaineering, but weight is less of a problem. The Soviet IDA71 rebreather was also manufactured in a high altitude version, which was operated as an oxygen rebreather.

===Anaesthesia systems===

Anaesthetic machines can be configured as rebreathers to provide oxygen and anaesthetic gases to a patient during surgery or other procedures that require sedation. An absorbent is present in the machine to remove the carbon dioxide from the loop.

Both semi-closed and fully closed circuit systems may be used for anaesthetic machines, and both push-pull (pendulum) two directional flow and one directional loop systems are used. The breathing circuit of a loop configured machine has two unidirectional valves so that only scrubbed gas flows to the patient while expired gas goes back to the machine.

The anaesthetic machine can also provide gas to ventilated patients who cannot breathe on their own. A waste gas scavenging system removes any gasses from the operating room to avoid environmental contamination.

===Space suits===

One of the functions of a space suit is to provide the wearer with breathing gas. This can be done via an umbilical from the life-support systems of the spacecraft or habitat, or from a primary life support system carried on the suit. Both of these systems involve rebreather technology as they both remove carbon dioxide from the breathing gas and add oxygen to compensate for oxygen used by the wearer.
Space suits usually use oxygen rebreathers as this allows a lower pressure in the suit which gives the wearer better freedom of movement.

===Habitat life-support systems===
Submarines, underwater habitats, bomb shelters, space stations, and other living spaces occupied by several people over medium to long periods on a limited gas supply, are equivalent to closed circuit rebreathers in principle, but generally rely on mechanical circulation of breathing gas through the scrubbers.

==Safety==

There are several safety issues with rebreather equipment, and these tend to be more severe in diving rebreathers.

===Hazards===
Some of the hazards are due to the way the equipment works, while others are related to the environment in which the equipment is used, as rebreathers are usually used where no breathable ambient atmosphere is available.

====Hypoxia====
Hypoxia can occur in any rebreather which contains enough inert gas to allow breathing without triggering automatic gas addition.

In an oxygen rebreather this can occur if the loop is not sufficiently purged at the start of use. Purging is the replacement of the original gas content by fresh gas, and may have to be repeated to completely remove inert gas. Purging should be done while breathing off the unit so that the inert gas in the user&#x27;s lungs and body tissues that finds its way into the loop is also removed from the system.

====Carbon dioxide buildup====
Carbon dioxide buildup will occur if the scrubber medium is absent, badly packed, inadequate or exhausted. The normal human body is fairly sensitive to carbon dioxide partial pressure, and a buildup will be noticed by the user. However, there is not often much that can be done to rectify the problem except changing to another breathing gas supply until the scrubber can be repacked. Continued use of a rebreather with an ineffective scrubber is not possible for very long, as the levels will become toxic and the user will experience extreme respiratory distress, ultimately leading to loss of consciousness and death. The rate at which these problems develop depends on the volume of the circuit and the metabolic rate of the user at the time.

Carbon dioxide buildup can also occur when a combination of exertion and work of breathing exceeds the capacity of the user. If this occurs where the user cannot reduce exertion sufficiently, it may be impossible to correct. This problem is more likely to occur with diving rebreathers at depths where the density of the breathing gas is severely elevated. The only recourse is to vent the expelled breath outside the closed system, therefore not reusing the oxygen, and thereby increasing use of the gas mixture, but this is not an option in every field of application.

====Leakage of toxic gases into the breathing loop====
Industrial rebreathers are often used where the ambient air is contaminated and may be toxic. Parts of the loop will be at a slightly lower than external ambient pressure during inhalation, and if the circuit is not airtight external gases may leak in. This is a particular issue around the edge of a full-face mask, where the rubber mask skirt must seal against the user&#x27;s face.

====Fire hazards of high concentration of oxygen====
High partial pressures of oxygen greatly increase fire hazard, and many materials which are self-extinguishing in atmospheric air will burn continuously in a high oxygen concentration. This is more of a hazard for terrestrial applications such as rescue and firefighting than for diving, where the ignition risk is relatively low.

====Caustic cocktail====
Caused by a loop flood reaching the absorbent canister, so only applicable in immersed applications.

===Failure modes===
====Scrubber failure====
The term &quot;break-through&quot; means the failure of the scrubber to continue removing sufficient carbon dioxide from the gas circulating in the loop. This will inevitably happen if the scrubber is used too long, but can happen prematurely in some circumstances. There are several ways that the scrubber may fail or become less efficient:
*Complete consumption of the active ingredient in a &quot;general break through&quot;. Depending on scrubber design and user workload, this may be gradual, allowing the user to become aware of the problem in time to make a controlled exit or bailout to open circuit, or relatively sudden, triggering an urgent or emergency response. 
*Bypassing the absorbent. The absorbent granules must be packed closely so that all exhaled gas comes into contact with the surface of soda lime and the canister is designed to avoid any large spaces or gaps between the absorbent granules or between the granules and the canister walls that would let gas bypass contact with the absorbent. If any of the seals, such as O-rings, or spacers that prevent bypassing of the scrubber, are not present or not fitted properly, or if the scrubber canister has been incorrectly packed or fitted, it may allow the exhaled gas to bypass the absorbent, and the scrubber will be less effective. This failure mode is also called &quot;tunneling&quot; when absorbent settles to form void spaces inside the canister. Bypass will cause an unexpected early break-through. 
*When the gas mix is under pressure at depth, the gas molecules are more densely packed, and the carbon dioxide molecules&#x27; mean path between collisions is shorter, so they are not so free to move around to reach the absorbent surface, and require a longer dwell time. Because of this effect, the scrubber must be bigger for deep diving than is needed for a shallow-water, industrial or high altitude rebreather. 
*Carbon dioxide absorbent can be caustic and can cause burns to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin. A mixture of water and absorbent occurs when the scrubber floods and depending on the chemicals used, can produce a chalky taste or a burning sensation if the contaminated water reaches the mouthpiece, which should prompt the diver to switch to an alternative source of breathing gas and rinse their mouth out with water. This is known to rebreather divers as a &quot;caustic cocktail&quot;. The excessive wetting of the absorbent also reduces the rate of carbon dioxide removal and can cause premature break-through even if no caustic liquid reaches the diver. Work of breathing may also increase. Many modern diving rebreather absorbents are designed not to produce this caustic fluid if they get wet. 
*In below-freezing operation (primarily mountain climbing), wet scrubber chemicals can freeze when oxygen bottles are changed, while there is a pause in the exothermic reaction of taking up the carbon dioxide, thus preventing carbon dioxide from reaching the scrubber material, and slowing the reaction when used again.

====Other failure modes====
*Flooding of the ambient pressure volume can occur in diving rebreathers.
*Gas leakage to or from the ambient pressure volume can occur. Since the volume of gas lost or gained is likely to be very small, it is most relevant when the surroundings contain toxic gases or fumes.
*Oxygen monitoring failure can lead to incorrect partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas. This is only relevant in mixed gas rebreathers used for diving.
*Gas injection system failure is also mainly a problem of mixed gas diving rebreathers. Oxygen rebreathers gas injection systems are generally robust and reliable and can be manually overridden if they fail, and this form of failure is identifiable by an inappropriate volume of gas in the ambient pressure volume of the rebreather.

==History==
===Early history===
Around 1620, Cornelius Drebbel discovered that heating saltpetre (potassium nitrate) would generate oxygen.

The first basic rebreather based on carbon dioxide absorption was patented in France in 1808 by Pierre-Marie Touboulic from Brest, a mechanic in Napoleon&#x27;s Imperial Navy. This early rebreather design worked with an oxygen reservoir, the oxygen being delivered progressively by the diver and circulating in a closed circuit through a sponge soaked in limewater, a solution of calcium hydroxide in water. Touboulic called his invention &quot;Ichtioandre&quot; (Greek for &#x27;fish-man&#x27;). There is no evidence of a prototype having been manufactured.

A prototype rebreather was built in 1849 by Pierre Aimable De Saint Simon Sicard,

In 1853 Professor T. Schwann presented a rebreather at the Belgian Academy of Science. It had a large back mounted oxygen tank with working pressure of about 13.3 bar, and two scrubbers containing sponges soaked in a caustic soda solution.

===Working rebreathers===
The first commercially practical closed-circuit scuba was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His self-contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with (estimated) 50–60% O2 supplied from a copper tank and CO2 scrubbed by rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash; the system giving a duration of about three hours. Fleuss tested his device in 1879 by spending an hour submerged in a water tank, then one week later by diving to a depth of 5.5 m in open water, upon which occasion he was slightly injured when his assistants abruptly pulled him to the surface.

His apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by Alexander Lambert, the lead diver on the Severn Tunnel construction project, who was able to travel 1000 feet in the darkness to close several submerged sluice doors in the tunnel; this had defeated his best efforts with standard diving dress due to the danger of the air supply hose becoming fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings. In 1880 Fleuss, used a rebreather to inspect Seaham Colliery in the UK after a gas explosion.

Fleuss and Siebe Gorban developed the Proto breathing apparatus for mine rescue in 1911.

Fleuss continually improved his apparatus, adding a demand regulator and tanks capable of holding greater amounts of oxygen at higher pressure. Sir Robert Davis, head of Siebe Gorman, improved the oxygen rebreather in 1910 with his invention of the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, the first practical rebreather to be made in quantity. While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for submarine crews, it was soon also used for diving, being a handy shallow water diving apparatus with a thirty-minute endurance, and as an industrial breathing set.
The rig comprised a rubber breathing/buoyancy bag containing a canister of barium hydroxide to scrub exhaled CO2 and, in a pocket at the lower end of the bag, a steel pressure cylinder holding approximately 56 litres of oxygen at a pressure of 120 bar. The cylinder was equipped with a control valve and was connected to the breathing bag. Opening the cylinder&#x27;s valve admitted oxygen to the bag and charged it to the pressure of the surrounding water. The rig also included an emergency buoyancy bag on the front of to help keep the wearer afloat. The DSEA was adopted by the Royal Navy after further development by Davis in 1927. Various industrial oxygen rebreathers such as the Siebe Gorman Salvus and the Siebe Gorman Proto, both invented in the early 1900s, were derived from it.

Professor Georges Jaubert invented the chemical compound Oxylithe in 1907. It was a form of sodium peroxide (Na2O2) or sodium superoxide (NaO2). As it absorbs carbon dioxide in a rebreather&#x27;s scrubber it emits oxygen. This compound was first incorporated into a rebreather design by Captain S.S. Hall and Dr. O. Rees of the Royal Navy in 1909. Although intended for use as a submarine escape apparatus, it was never accepted by the Royal Navy and was instead used for shallow water diving.

In 1912 the German firm Dräger began mass production of their own version of standard diving dress with the air supply from a rebreather. The apparatus had been invented some years earlier by Hermann Stelzner, an engineer at the Dräger company, for mine rescue.

In the 1930s, after some tragic accidents in the 1920s, the United States Navy began to equip Porpoise- and Salmon-class submarines with primitive rebreathers called Momsen lungs, which were in use until the 1960s.

===Rebreathers during World War II===

In the 1930s, Italian sport spearfishers began to use the Davis rebreather; Italian manufacturers received a licence from the English patent holders to produce it. This practice soon came to the attention of the Italian Navy, which developed an extensively upgraded model designed by Teseo Tesei and that was used by its frogman unit Decima Flottiglia MAS with good results during World War II.

During the Second World War, captured Italian frogmen&#x27;s rebreathers influenced improved designs for British rebreathers. Many British frogmen&#x27;s breathing sets used aircrew breathing oxygen cylinders salvaged from shot-down German Luftwaffe aircraft. The earliest of these breathing sets may have been modified Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus; their fullface masks were the type intended for the Siebe Gorman Salvus, but in later operations different designs were used, leading to a fullface mask with one big face window, at first circular or oval and later rectangular (mostly flat, but the sides curved back to allow better vision sideways). Early British frogman&#x27;s rebreathers had rectangular counterlungs on the chest like Italian frogman&#x27;s rebreathers, but later designs had a square recess in the top of the counterlung so it could extend further up toward the shoulders. In front they had a rubber collar that was clamped around the absorbent canister. Some British armed forces divers used bulky thick diving suits called Sladen suits; one version of it had a flip-up single faceplate for both eyes to let the user get binoculars to his eyes when on the surface.

The Dräger rebreathers, especially the DM20 and DM40 model series, were used by the German helmet divers and German frogmen during World War II. Rebreathers for the US Navy were developed by Dr. Christian J. Lambertsen for underwater warfare. Lambertsen held the first closed-circuit oxygen rebreather course in the United States for the Office of Strategic Services maritime unit at the Naval Academy on 17 May 1943.

During and after WWII, needs arose in the armed forces to dive deeper than allowed by pure oxygen. That prompted, at least in Britain, design of simple constant-flow &quot;mixture rebreather&quot; variants of some of their diving oxygen rebreathers (= what is now called &quot;nitrox&quot;): SCMBA from the SCBA (Swimmer Canoeist&#x27;s Breathing Apparatus), and CDMBA from the Siebe Gorman CDBA, by adding an extra gas supply cylinder. Before a dive with such a set, the diver had to know the maximum or working depth of his dive, and how fast his body used his oxygen supply, and from those to calculate what to set his rebreather&#x27;s gas flow rate to.

===Post-WWII===
The diving pioneer Hans Hass used Dräger oxygen rebreathers in the early 1940s for underwater cinematography.

Due to the military importance of the rebreather, amply demonstrated during the naval campaigns of the Second World War, most governments were reluctant to issue the technology into the public domain. In Britain rebreather use for civilians was negligible, and the BSAC formally prohibited rebreather use by its members. The Italian firms Pirelli and Cressi-Sub at first each sold a model of sport diving rebreather, but after a while discontinued those models. Some home made rebreathers were used by cave divers to penetrate cave sumps.

Most high-altitude mountaineers use open-circuit oxygen equipment; the 1953 Everest expedition used both closed-circuit and open-circuit oxygen equipment: see bottled oxygen.

Eventually the Cold War ended, and in 1989 the Communist Bloc collapsed, and as a result the perceived risk of sabotage attacks by combat divers dwindled, and Western armed forces had less reason to requisition civilian rebreather patents, and automatic and semi-automatic recreational diving rebreathers with oxygen partial pressure sensors started to appear.

<text>Grains of paradise (Aframomum melegueta) is a species in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and closely related to cardamom. Its seeds are used as a spice (ground or whole); it imparts a pungent, black-pepper-like flavor with hints of citrus. It is also known as melegueta pepper, Guinea grains, ossame, or fom wisa, and is sometimes confused with alligator pepper. The terms &quot;African pepper&quot; and &quot;Guinea pepper&quot; have also been used, but are ambiguous as they can apply to other spices such as grains of Selim (&quot;Xylopia aethiopica&quot;).

It is native to West Africa, which is sometimes named the Pepper Coast (or Grain Coast) because of this commodity. It is also an important cash crop in the Basketo district of southern Ethiopia.

==Characteristics==
&quot;Aframomum melegueta&quot; is an herbaceous perennial plant native to swampy habitats along the West African coast. Its trumpet-shaped, purple flowers develop into pods long, containing numerous small, reddish-brown seeds.

The pungent, peppery taste of the seeds is caused by aromatic ketones, such as (6)-paradol (systematic name: 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-one). Essential oils, which are the dominating flavor components in the closely related cardamom, occur only in traces.

The stem at times can be short, and usually shows signs of scars and dropped leaves. The leaves are narrow and similar to those of bamboo, with a well-structured vascular system. The flowers of the herbaceous plant are aromatic, with an orange-colored lip and rich pinkish-orange upper part. The fruits contain numerous, small, golden red-brown seeds.
==Ecology==
Melegueta is a major component in the diet of Western Lowland gorilla—around 80 to 90 percent. The gorillas eat the entire fruit and act as a source of seed dispersal for melegueta. In addition to food, the plant is also the most common material used to make nests and beds.

==Uses==
Melegueta pepper is commonly used in the cuisines of West and North Africa, from where it has been traditionally transported by camel caravan routes through the Sahara desert and distributed to Sicily and the rest of Italy. Mentioned by Pliny as &quot;African pepper&quot; but subsequently forgotten in Europe, they were renamed &quot;grains of paradise&quot; and became a popular substitute for black pepper in Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. The &quot;Ménagier de Paris&quot; recommends it for improving wine that &quot;smells stale&quot;. Through the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, the theory of the four humors governed theories about nourishment on the part of doctors, herbalists, and druggists. In this context, John Russell characterized grains of paradise in &quot;The Boke of Nurture&quot; as &quot;hot and moist&quot;.

In 1469, King Afonso V of Portugal granted the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea to Lisbon merchant Fernão Gomes. This included the exclusivity in trade of &quot;Aframomum melegueta&quot;, then called malagueta pepper. The grant came at the cost of 100,000 annually and agreement to explore of the coast of Africa per year for five years; this gives some indication of the European value of the spice. After Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492 and brought the first samples of the chili pepper (&quot;Capsicum frutescens&quot;) back with him to Europe, the name , and Spanish and Portuguese spelling, was then applied to the new chili &quot;pepper&quot; because its piquancy was reminiscent of grains of paradise. Malagueta, thanks to its low price, remained popular in Europe even after the Portuguese opened the direct maritime route to the Spice Islands around 1500. This namesake, the malagueta chili, remains popular in Brazil, the Caribbean, Portugal, and Mozambique.

The importance of the &quot;A. melegueta&quot; spice is shown by the designation of the area from the St. John River (near present-day Buchanan) to Harper in Liberia as the Grain Coast or Pepper Coast in honor of the availability of grains of paradise. Later, the craze for the spice waned, and its uses were reduced to a flavoring for sausages and beer. In the 18th century, its importation to Great Britain collapsed after an act of Parliament during the reign of George III forbade its use in alcoholic beverages. In 1855, England imported about per year legally (duty paid). By 1880, the 9th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; reported: &quot;Grains of paradise are to some extent used in veterinary practice, but for the most part illegally to give a fictitious strength to malt liquors, gin, and cordials&quot;.

The presence of the seeds in the diets of lowland gorillas in the wild seems to have some sort of beneficial effect on their cardiovascular health. They also eat the leaves, and use them for bedding material. The absence of the seeds in the diets of captive lowland gorillas may contribute to their occasionally poor cardiovascular health in zoos.

Today the condiment is sometimes used in gourmet cuisine as a replacement for pepper, and to give unique flavor in some craft beers, gins, and Norwegian . Grains of paradise are starting to enjoy a slight resurgence in popularity in North America due to their use by some well-known chefs. Alton Brown is a fan of the condiment, and he uses it in okra stew and his apple-pie recipe on an episode of the TV cooking show &quot;Good Eats&quot;. Grains of paradise are also used by people on certain diets, such as a raw food diet, because they are considered less irritating to digestion than black pepper.

==Folk medicine and ritual uses==
In West African folk medicine, grains of paradise are valued for their warming and digestive properties, and among the Efik people in Nigeria have been used for divination and ordeals determining guilt. &quot;A. melegueta&quot; has been introduced to the Caribbean and Latin America, where it is used in Voodoo religious rites. It is also found widely among Protestant Christian practitioners of African-American hoodoo and rootwork, where the seeds are employed in luck-bringing and may be held in the mouth or chewed to prove sincerity.

<text>The Pike stream cipher was invented by Ross Anderson to be a &quot;leaner and meaner&quot; version of FISH after he broke FISH in 1994. Its name is supposed to be a humorous allusion to the pike fish.

The cipher combines ideas from A5 with the lagged Fibonacci generators used in FISH. It is about 10% faster than FISH, yet believed to be much stronger. It potentially has a huge key length, and no attacks have been published .

== Inner workings ==

Pike consists of three lagged Fibonacci generators with relations
formula_1

The clock control is based on the carry bits.
If all carry bits agree we step all three LFG&#x27;s, otherwise we step the two who do agree.

This control will be delayed 8 cycles.
The final output is the XOR of the least significant words of all three generators.

<text>Avinash C. Kak (born 1944) is a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University who has conducted pioneering research in several areas of information processing. His most noteworthy contributions deal with algorithms, languages, and systems related to networks (including sensor networks), robotics, and computer vision. Born in Srinagar, Kashmir, he did his Bachelors in BE at University of Madras and Phd in Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. He joined the faculty of Purdue University in 1971.

His brother is the computer scientist Subhash Kak and sister the literary theorist Jaishree Odin.

== Robotics and computer vision ==
His contributions include the 3D-POLY, which is the fastest algorithm for recognizing 3D objects in depth maps
In 1992, Kosaka and Kak published FINALE, which is considered to be a computationally efficient and highly robust approach to vision-based navigation by indoor mobile robots. In 2003, a group of researchers that included Kak developed a tool for content-based image retrieval that was demonstrated by clinical trials to improve the performance of radiologists. This remains the only clinically evaluated system for content-based image retrieval for radiologists. His book &quot;Digital Picture Processing&quot;, co-authored with Azriel Rosenfeld, is also considered a classic and has been one of the most widely referenced sources in literature dealing with digital image processing and computer vision.

Kak is not a believer in Strong AI as evidenced by his provocative/amusing essay &quot;Why Robots Will Never Have Sex&quot;. This essay a rejoinder to those who believe that robots/computers will someday take over the world.

== Image reconstruction algorithms ==
The SART algorithm (Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique) proposed by Andersen and Kak in 1984 has had a major impact in CT imaging applications where the projection data is limited. As a measure of its popularity, researchers have proposed various extensions to 
SART: OS-SART, FA-SART, VW-OS-SART, SARTF, etc. Researchers have also studied how SART can best be implemented on different parallel processing architectures. SART and its proposed extensions are used in emission CT in nuclear medicine, dynamic CT, and holographic tomography, and other reconstruction applications. Convergence of the SART algorithm was theoretically established in 2004 by Jiang and Wang. His book &quot;Principles of Computerized Tomographic Imaging&quot;, now re-published as a classic in applied mathematics by SIAM (Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics), is widely used in courses dealing with modern medical imaging. It is one of the most frequently cited books in the literature on image reconstruction.

==Software engineering and open source==
The three books written by Kak in the course of his 17-year-long Objects Trilogy Project cover object-oriented programming, object-oriented scripting, and object-oriented design. The first of these, &quot;Programming with Objects&quot;, presents a comparative approach to the teaching and learning of two large object-oriented languages, C++ and Java. This book is now used in several universities for teaching object-oriented programming with C++ and Java simultaneously. The second book, &quot;Scripting with Objects&quot; does the same with Perl and Python. The last book of the trilogy is &quot;Designing with Objects&quot;. Regarding the teaching of programming languages in universities, Kak is critical of programs that start the students off with relatively easier-to-learn languages like Java. and 

Over the years, Kak has also contributed to several open-source projects. 
The software modules developed through these projects are widely used for data analytics and computer security. In addition, during the last decade, Kak has collaborated with people in industry and developed metrics for measuring the quality of large software systems and the usability of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

== Computer and network security ==
In computer security research, together with Padmini Jaikumar he has presented a robust solution to the difficult problem of botnet detection in computer networks. He has authored popular online lecture notes that are updated regularly. These notes provide comprehensive overview of computer and network security.

<doc id="294136" wikidata="Q8055091" url="?curid=294136" title="Yonkers Raceway &amp; Empire City Casino">
<text>Yonkers Raceway &amp; Empire City Casino, founded in 1899 as the Empire City Race Track, is a one-half-mile standardbred harness racing dirt track and slots racino located at the intersection of Central Park Avenue and Yonkers Avenue in Yonkers, New York, near the New York City border. It is owned by Vici Properties and operated by MGM Resorts International.

==History==
The original horse racing facility was opened in 1899 as Empire City Race Track by William H. Clark&#x27;s &#x27;Empire City Trotting Club. Clark died in 1900 and, with much litigation by his heirs over its proposed sale, the track remained closed for most of the next seven years except for special events. One such event occurred in 1902 when Barney Oldfield set a one-mile (1.6 km) record in an automobile at Empire City Race Track. Driving the Ford &#x27;999&#x27;, he covered the distance in 55.54 seconds.

The facility was purchased by New York grocery store magnate James Butler, who reopened it for Thoroughbred horse racing in 1907. Among the notable thoroughbreds who raced at Empire City, in 1936 Seabiscuit won the Scarsdale Handicap and in 1937 the Butler Handicap. After Butler&#x27;s death in 1934, the track continued to host &quot;the flats&quot; until 1942 when it was converted back to being a harness track. Some of its feature races were taken over by other New York area racetracks.

In 1950, William H. Cane, for whom the Cane Pace is named, headed a syndicate formed as the Algam Corporation which acquired Empire City and converted it to Yonkers Raceway. Its popularity having greatly declined since the 1960s (when crowds would occasionally reach 50,000), the entire property, according to some, had become an eyesore due to its owners leaving it in a state of disrepair.

In 1972, the Rooney family acquired Yonkers Raceway. It underwent some cosmetic changes in the late 1990s. It was used as a flea market, and hosted the annual Westchester County Fair, sponsored by the county&#x27;s Parks Department. In 1996, the finish line was relocated to the end of the stretch, increasing the length of the stretch from to the current . The following year, the grandstand was demolished. There was consideration on selling the site to the National Football League’s New York Jets which would have included a stadium; however, the plan was shelved after the environmental impact statement showed there would be significant traffic from elsewhere in the metropolitan area, and there was not enough political support for it.

In 2015, Yonkers Raceway applied for permission from the New York State Gaming Commission to relocate its finish line back by approximately 100 feet. This proposal was endorsed by the New York division of the Standardbred Owners Association. As of 2018, the new finish line has been in use for a considerable period of time. In January 2018, Yonkers eliminated the &quot;passing lane&quot; in the stretch that allowed horses to be in the second spot on the inside in the stretch to move inside one spot and come up in the inside.

In January 2019, MGM Resorts International bought the racetrack and casino from the Rooney family for $850 million in cash and stock. MGM then immediately sold the land and buildings to its affiliated REIT, MGM Growth Properties, for $625 million, leasing back the property and structures for $50 million per year. Vici Properties acquired MGM Growth, including Empire City, in 2022.

===Historic Thoroughbred flat races===
*Empire City Handicap (1900–1953)
*Mount Vernon Handicap (1907-1930)
*Yonkers Handicap (1907–1946)
*Fleetwing Handicap (1908–1953)
*Whirl Stakes (1908–1930)
*Empire City Derby (1917–1933)
*Scarsdale Handicap (1918–1947)
*Butler Handicap (1935–1953)
*Empire City Gold Cup (1947–1953)

==Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway==

Yonkers Raceway had a $225-million renovation designed by EwingCole to put in more than 7,500 slot machines. The first phase opened on October 11, 2006, with 1,870 machines. Despite a &quot;soft opening&quot;, with no major advertising or promotional campaigns, Yonkers netted $3.8 million in revenue in its first week, outpacing its nearest competitor, Saratoga Casino and Raceway, by two-thirds. The second phase of the project, which opened on December 28, 2006, added of space to bring the total number of slot machines to 4,000. On March 12, 2007, the third phase opened to bring the slot machine total to 5,300. Because the facility falls under state lottery laws, the minimum age to play the slot machines at Empire City is 18, unlike the other area casinos, where it is 21.

In a report released in 2012, Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway was the state&#x27;s &quot;most successful casino and racing venue&quot;. Through 2011, the facility provided more than 3,000 jobs and contributed $262 million in &quot;economic output&quot;.

In January 2013, Empire City Casino completed a new $50 million expansion designed by Studio V Architecture that added 66,000 square feet to the casino. The expansion featured a porte-cochere sculptural entrance; the largest window in the Northeast, a 300-foot-long and 27-foot-high depiction of the New York City skyline made entirely of nails; a new gaming floor with nearly 700 slot machines; and two new restaurants.

As of 2015, the casino hosts blackjack, craps, roulette, and baccarat tables in addition to the slot machines. The games are fully automated.

===Expansion proposal===
MGM Resorts is bidding for one of three downstate New York casino licenses. If awarded a license, they will expand the property. They will redesign the casino floor, develop a 5,000 seat performance venue and a sportsbook. There will also be additional restaurants and convention space. 

==Restaurants==

*Dan Rooney&#x27;s Café &amp; Bar: The first restaurant to open in Empire City Casino&#x27;s $50 million expansion is an Irish Pub styled after the original Dan Rooney’s Café &amp; Bar which was established in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s by the Rooney family. The train car dining room hosts 35 flat-screen televisions and nightly dueling pianos. “Two-time Michelin star winner and local New Yorker, Chef Christopher Lee” created the pub&#x27;s menu which contains a burger that won the Greenwich Food &amp; Wine Festival Burger Battle in 2012. 
*Pinch: The second restaurant in Empire City Casino&#x27;s expansion, Pinch, was created by Ducasse Studio, the consulting service of the “French chef and culinary impresario”, Alain Ducasse.

===History===

Yonkers used to be the site of the Cane Pace, one of the legs of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. It is now the host track for another leg, the Messenger Stakes. Yonkers is also home to the Yonkers Trot, one of the legs of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters. Due to the renovations at Yonkers, the Messenger and Yonkers Trot were moved to different racetracks for the 2004 and 2005 editions. The Messenger was moved to Harrington Raceway in Delaware in both years, and the Yonkers Trot was moved to Hawthorne Race Course in Stickney, IL in 2004, and Freehold Raceway in New Jersey in 2005.

Yonkers Raceway ran the Yonkers Trot and the Messenger on November 25, 2006, becoming the first harness track in America to host two Triple Crown races on the same day. Glidemaster, by virtue of winning the $728,000 Yonkers Trot, became the eighth horse to clinch the Trotting Triple Crown; the trotter would go on to be named 2006 &quot;Harness Horse of the Year&quot;.

Yonkers Raceway is also home to the Art Rooney Pace for three-year-olds. However, continued delays in the reopening of the track forced the 2006 edition of the race to be moved to Monticello Raceway. The final of the 2007 Art Rooney Pace, run on June 2, 2007, was the richest race in Yonkers history, with a $1 million purse. It was won by Southwind Lynx, driven by Tim Tetrick, with a late outside run in 1:52 3/5. The current track record for a trotting race horse is 1:54 3/5 set by Shutter Boy on October 30, 2009, with the trainer John McDermott and driver Yannick Gingras; this was not a stakes race.

<text>Fish (sometimes capitalised as FISH) was the UK&#x27;s GC&amp;CS Bletchley Park codename for any of several German teleprinter stream ciphers used during World War II. Enciphered teleprinter traffic was used between German High Command and Army Group commanders in the field, so its intelligence value (Ultra) was of the highest strategic value to the Allies. This traffic normally passed over landlines, but as German forces extended their geographic reach beyond western Europe, they had to resort to wireless transmission.

Bletchley Park decrypts of messages enciphered with the Enigma machines revealed that the Germans called one of their wireless teleprinter transmission systems &quot;&quot; (&#x27;sawfish&#x27;) which led British cryptographers to refer to encrypted German radiotelegraphic traffic as &quot;Fish.&quot; The code &quot;Tunny&quot; (&#x27;tuna&#x27;) was the name given to the first non-Morse link, and it was subsequently used for the Lorenz SZ machines and the traffic enciphered by them.

== History ==
In June 1941, the British &quot;Y&quot; wireless intercept stations, as well as receiving Enigma-enciphered Morse code traffic, started to receive non-Morse traffic which was initially called NoMo. NoMo1 was a German army link between Berlin and Athens, and NoMo2 a temporary air force link between Berlin and Königsberg. The parallel Enigma-enciphered link to NoMo2, which was being read by Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, revealed that the Germans called the wireless teleprinter transmission systems &quot;Sägefisch&quot; (sawfish). This led the British to use the code Fish dubbing the machine and its traffic Tunny.

The enciphering/deciphering equipment was called a &quot;Geheimschreiber&quot; (secret writer) which, like Enigma, used a symmetrical substitution alphabet. The teleprinter code used was the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2)—Murray&#x27;s modification of the 5-bit Baudot code.

When the Germans invaded Russia, during World War II, the Germans began to use a new type of enciphered transmission between central headquarters and headquarters in the field. The transmissions were known as Fish at Bletchley Park. (See Lorenz cipher, Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher.) The German army used Fish for communications between the highest authorities in Berlin and the high-ranking officials of the German Army in the field. The Fish traffic which the personnel at Bletchley Park intercepted, contained discussions, orders, situation reports and many more details about the intentions of the German Army. However, these transmissions were so challenging to decrypt that even with the assistance of the high speed Colossus computer, the messages could not be read until several days later. “Vital intelligence was obtained about Hitler’s intentions in the run up to D-Day 1944.”

== Traffic code names ==
===Tunny===

The NoMo1 link was initially named Tunny (for tunafish), a name which went on to be used both for the Lorenz SZ40/42 machines and for the Bletchley Park analogues of them. The NoMo1 link was subsequently renamed Codfish. A large number of Tunny links were monitored by the Y-station at Knockholt and given names of fish. Most of these were between the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (German High Command, OKW) in Berlin and German army commands throughout occupied Europe. 

The Tunny links were based on two central transmitting and receiving points in Strausberg near Berlin for Army generals in the West and one in Königsberg in Prussia for the Eastern Front. The number of radio links jumped from eight in mid-1943 to fourteen or fifteen. In 1941 the initial experimental Tunny link was between Berlin and Athens/Salonoka. 
By D-Day in 1944 there were twenty-six links, based on Konigsberg and Straussberg. Other links were usually mobile; in two trucks, one with radio equipment and one with a &quot;send&quot; Tunny machine and a receive &quot;Tunny&quot; machine. The links carried very high-grade intelligence: messages from Hitler and the High Command to various Army Group commanders in the field. 

Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher at Bletchley Park was assisted initially by a machine called Heath Robinson and later by the Colossus computers yielded a great deal of valuable high-level intelligence.
Tunny decrypts provided high-grade intelligence in an unprecedented quality. Walter Jacobs, a US Army codebreaker who worked at Bletchley Park, wrote in an official report on the operation to break Tunny that in March 1945 alone &#x27;upward of five million letters of current transmission, containing intelligence of the highest order, were deciphered&#x27;.

===Sturgeon===
This was the name given to traffic encoded with the Siemens and Halske T52 &quot;Geheimschreiber&quot;. In May 1940, after the German invasion of Norway, the Swedish mathematician and cryptographer Arne Beurling used traffic intercepted from telegraph lines that passed through Sweden to break this cipher. Although Bletchley Park eventually diagnosed and broke Sturgeon, the relatively low value of the intelligence gained, compared to the effort involved, meant that they did not read much of its traffic.

===Thrasher===
This was the name used for traffic enciphered on a &quot;Geheimschreiber&quot; that was probably the Siemens T43 one-time tape machine. This was used only on a few circuits, in the later stages of the war and was diagnosed at Bletchley Park, but considered to be unbreakable.

<text>Ciutat Vella (, meaning in English &quot;Old City&quot;) is a district of Barcelona, numbered District 1. The name means &quot;old city&quot; in Catalan and refers to the oldest neighborhoods in the city of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. &quot;Ciutat Vella&quot; is nestled between the Mediterranean Sea and the neighborhood called &quot;l&#x27;Eixample&quot; (&quot;the Extension&quot;). 

There are four administrative neighborhoods (some of them include former or traditional neighborhoods):
*La Barceloneta
*El Gòtic
*El Raval
*Sant Pere, Santa Caterina i la Ribera:
**Sant Pere
**Santa Caterina
**La Ribera

==Les Rambles==

Running down the center of the &quot;Ciutat Vella&quot; (dividing the &quot;Raval&quot; and &quot;Barri Gòtic&quot;) are the boulevards &quot;Les Rambles&quot;, popularly known as &quot;La Rambla&quot; (in singular) since they are continuous, like a single street. &quot;Les Rambles&quot; stretches from &quot;Plaça Catalunya&quot; to the Mediterranean Sea and, since the 1990s, now extends out over the sea into one of Barcelona&#x27;s newest centers of entertainment, &quot;Maremàgnum&quot;. Each of &quot;Les Rambles&quot; has its own specialty. &quot;La Rambla de les Flors&quot; (The Flowers &quot;Rambla&quot;) is devoted to flower stands, another &quot;Rambla&quot; to animal vendors (selling mainly birds), and the lowest &quot;Rambla&quot; hosts temporary art fairs. &quot;El Mercat de Sant Josep&quot; (more commonly known as &quot;La Boqueria&quot;) and &quot;Gran Teatre del Liceu&quot; (Barcelona&#x27;s Opera House) are both located here. &quot;Les Rambles&quot; are among the most frequently travelled streets by pedestrians in Barcelona.

At the bottom, there is the &quot;Museu Marítim&quot; (naval museum), which chronicles the history of life on the Mediterranean, including a full-scale model of a galley. The museum is housed in the medieval &quot;Drassanes&quot; (shipyards), where the ships that made Catalonia a great sea power in the Mediterranean were built.

==Raval==

This portion of the city is often referred to as &quot;el Barri Xinès&quot;, or &quot;Chinatown&quot;. The &quot;Museu d&#x27;Art Contemporani de Barcelona&quot; (Contemporary Art Museum of Barcelona), the &quot;Rambla del Raval&quot; (a walkway to the sea) and the &quot;Filmoteca de Catalunya&quot; are in this neighborhood.

==Gothic Quarter==

On the other side of La Rambla, is the Gothic Quarter. This neighborhood houses the Barcelona Cathedral, the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya, and the Barcelona City Hall. Tourists visit this neighborhood to see Royal Square (a Spanish-style plaza) and to shop in one of the tourist shops along Ferran street. The Museu Picasso can be found in the area known as &quot;el Born&quot;, within the Barri Gótic, in addition to the historic restaurant &quot;Els Quatre Gats&quot; (The Four Cats), which was a popular hang-out for artists, including Pablo Picasso.

To the north of the Gothic Quarter lie the &quot;Jardins de Fonseré i Mestre&quot; which contain modernist buildings housing zoological and geological collections. The adjacent &quot;&quot; includes both the Parliament of Catalonia and the Barcelona Zoo whose most famous resident was an albino gorilla, Snowflake, who died in 2003 of skin cancer.

<text>Srinagar (; ) is a city in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir in the disputed Kashmir region. It is the largest city and summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an Indian-administered union territory. It lies in the Kashmir Valley along the banks of the Jhelum River, and the shores of Dal Lake and Anchar Lakes, between the Hari Parbat and Shankaracharya hills. The city is known for its natural environment, various gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. It is also known for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts like the Kashmir shawl (made of pashmina and cashmere wool), papier-mâché, wood carving, carpet weaving, and jewel making, as well as for dried fruits. It is the second-largest metropolitan area in the Himalayas (after Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal).

Founded in the 6th century during the rule of the Gonanda dynasty according to the Rajatarangini, the city took on the name of an earlier capital thought to have been founded by the Mauryas in its vicinity. The city remained the most important capital of the Kashmir Valley under the Hindu dynasties, and was a major centre of learning. During the 14th–16th centuries the city&#x27;s old town saw major expansions, particularly under the Shah Mir dynasty, whose kings used various parts of it as their capitals. It became the spiritual centre of Kashmir, and attracted several Sufi preachers. It also started to emerge as a hub of shawl weaving and other Kashmiri handicrafts. In the late 16th century, the city became part of the Mughal Empire, many of whose emperors used it as their summer resort. Many Mughal gardens were built in the city and around Dal lake during this time, of which Shalimar and Nishat are the most well-known.

After passing through the hands of the Afghan Durranis and the Sikhs in the late 18th and early 19th century, it eventually became the summer capital of the Dogra kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846. The city became a popular tourist destination among Europeans and Indian elites during this time, with several hotels and its iconic houseboats being built. In 1952, the city became the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, a region administered by India as a state, with Jammu being its winter capital. It was the flashpoint of violence during the 1990s and early 2000s insurgency in the region. In 2019, it became the summer capital of a smaller region which is administered by India as a union territory, after the former state&#x27;s reorganisation.

== Name ==
The earliest records, such as Kalhana&#x27;s &quot;Rajatarangini&quot;, mentions the Sanskrit name &quot;shri-nagara&quot; which have been interpreted distinctively by scholars in two ways: one being &quot;&quot;The city of &quot;Shri&quot; (श्री), the Hindu goddess of prosperity, meaning &quot;City of Lakshmi&quot;
and other being &quot;sūrya-nagar&quot;, meaning &quot;City of the Surya&quot; (trans) &quot;City of Sun&quot;.&quot; The name was used for an older capital in the vicinity of the present-day city, before being used for it. Between the 14th and 19th centuries, and especially during Mughal rule, the city was also referred to simply as &quot;Kashmir&quot; or &quot;Shahr-i-Kashmir&quot; ().

==History==
===Early history===
According to the Rajatarangini of Kalhana, a capital city by the name of &quot;Srinagari&quot; was built in the Kashmir valley by Ashoka. Kalhana calls this capital &quot;puranadhisthana&quot;, Sanskrit for &#x27;old capital&#x27;, identified as present-day Pandrethan, 3.5 kilometres south-east of Srinagar. A &#x27;new capital&#x27; was built by king Pravarasena, called &quot;Parvarapura&quot;, in 6th century CE. &quot;Srinagari&quot; continued to be used as a name for this capital. This new capital was located at the base of the Hari Parbat hill on the right bank of the Jhelum, corresponding to the location of modern-day Srinagar. Kalhana describes the capital having several markets, mansions, wooden houses, grand temples and canals, and also refers to the Dal lake and Jhelum river. A long embankment was constructed on the Jhelum by Pravarasena to protect the city from floods, parts of which have survived to the present day. The two capitals are also mentioned in the chronicle of Chinese traveller Huein Tsang who visited the city in 631 CE. Although several other capitals of Kashmir were constructed by other rulers over the next few centuries, Pravarasena&#x27;s Srinagar survived as the capital. The city was divided into several parts, each with its own guardian deity, which continue to be worshipped by Hindu Kashmiris. The 8th century scholar Adi Shankara visited the city and founded the Shankaracharya Temple here, at the site of the earlier Jyeshteshwara Temple. The city gradually extended to the left bank of the Jhelum river, and in the early 12th century the royal palace was shifted to this side.

===Sultanate period===

Rinchana, a Buddhist convert to Islam who briefly ruled Kashmir in the early 14th century, built the first mosque in Kashmir on the site of a Buddhist temple in a colony of Srinagar built by him. The Muslim rulers that came after him established their capitals in areas of present-day old city Srinagar. During the rule of the Sultans, the city became synonymous with the Kashmir valley, and &#x27;Srinagar&#x27; fell into disuse as a name for it. During the rule of Qutbuddin, Islamic preacher Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani visited the valley and established his seat of preaching in Srinagar. Sultan Sikandar Shahmiri (1389–1413 CE) built the &quot;Khanqah-e-Moula&quot; at this location, and also built the Jamia Mosque at Nowhatta in 1402. The oldest surviving example of forcible conversion of a Hindu place of worship into Muslim shrine in Kashmir also appears from Srinagar under Sikandar&#x27;s rule. Sikandar&#x27;s successor Zain-ul-Abidin undertook several constructions in and around Srinagar. He built the &quot;Zainakadal&quot; bridge connecting the two halves of the city on either side of the Jhelum river, the Mar canal and two islands inside Dal lake called Sona Lank and Rupa Lank. He also built a stone shrine for his Islamic teacher at Madin Sahib, and a brick mausoleum for his mother constructed using materials from a Hindu structure and showing Timurid influences, where he was also buried after his death. He is also credited with establishing industries around the arts of shawl and carpet weaving, papier-maché, and wood carving in Srinagar.

===Mughal rule===

The Mughals annexed Kashmir in 1586 after a period of internal instability in the valley, and added it to their Kabul province. Mughal emperor Akbar visited the valley three times. During his second visit in 1592, an elaborate Diwali celebration was held in Srinagar. On the final such visit, he was accompanied by the first recorded European visitors to the area. Akbar built fortifications around the Hari Parbat hill, and established a township called &quot;Nagar Nagar&quot; there. He also built a shrine for Hamza Makhdoom, a Sufi mystic of Kashmir&#x27;s Rishi order, on the southern slope of Hari Parbat which was later expanded several times. His successor Jahangir was particularly fond of the Kashmir valley and frequently visited it. His rule brought prosperity to Srinagar, and several Mughal gardens were built in the city and around the Dal lake during his and his successor Shah Jahan&#x27;s reign, including the Shalimar and Nishat Bagh. Empress Nur Jahan built the Pathar Mosque on the left bank of Jhelum river opposite the &quot;Khānqāh-e-Moula&quot; in 1623, the mosque was however deemed unfit for worship soon after its construction and used instead for non-religious purposes. Shah Jahan made Kashmir into a separate &quot;Subah&quot; (province) with its administrative seat at Srinagar in 1638. The Aali Masjid was built during the reign of Aurangzeb (1658–1707), as was the Safa kadal bridge over the Jhelum. The &quot;moi muqaddas&quot;, a relic believed to be the hair strand of prophet Muhammad&#x27;s beard, also arrived in Kashmir during this time, and was housed in a Mughal palace at Hazratbal, which became the Hazratbal Dargah. A number of Europeans visited the city during the later Mughal period.

===Afghan and Sikh rule===
In 1753, Kashmir passed into the hands of the Afghan Durrani Empire. The Afghans undertook reconstructions in Srinagar and built the palace at Shergarhi at the site of a pre-existing ancient palace, as well as the fort atop Hari Parbat. However, contemporary accounts describe the city as filthy and deteriorating, and it also saw worsening inter-community relations during Afghan rule, with repeated Hindu-Muslim and Shia-Sunni riots, and state persecution of Pandits. In 1819, the Sikh Empire assumed control of Kashmir. Under them, &quot;Srinagar&quot;, the old name of the city, was restored. The situation in the city did not improve much under Sikh rule, and the city remained in a state of decay. They also imposed several restrictions on Muslim religious expression, and closed the gates of the Jamia Mosque, which remained closed until 1843. A Shia-Sunni riot happened in the city in 1837.

===Dogra rule===

With the establishment of Dogra rule following the 1846 Treaty of Amritsar, Srinagar became the capital of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. Taxes were increased and the production of silk, saffron, paper, tobacco, wine, and salt, as well as the sale of grain, became the monopoly of the state. It was a capital offence for a Muslim to kill a cow as late as the 1920s; later, the penalty was reduced to ten years of imprisonment and still later to seven years (Section 219 of Ranbir Penal Code). The Dogras found Srinagar deteriorating, filthy and overcrowded. The city used to see several break-outs of cholera, as well as earthquakes, floods, fires and famines. The famine of 1877–79 is said to have halved the city&#x27;s population. Consequently, due to the famine and forced labour in the villages, a considerable number of people migrated to Srinagar.

The Darbar Move was introduced in 1872 by Ranbir Singh, whereby the capital moved to Jammu for six months during the winter albeit later phased down by Hari Singh who &quot;fixed his headquarters permanently at Jammu&quot;. The Ministers and Heads of Departments continued to followed it, nevertheless, it was still a move which was resented by Kashmiris, particularly Pandits. The Raghunath Temple was also completed during Ranbir Singh&#x27;s rule. With a global decline in shawl trade during late 19th century, the shawl weaving class of the city was upended. Several changes were ushered in during the reign of Pratap Singh (1885–1925). A British Residency was established in Srinagar and direct British influence on the administration of the state grew. During this time, Srinagar, and in turn the Kashmir Valley, was connected to the rest of India via roads, which saw increased trade with Punjab. In 1886, a municipality was established for the city of Srinagar. Works for sanitation and urban development undertaken by the municipality were often met with stiff opposition by the residents, who were averse to changes. In the late 19th and early 20th century, modern tourism began to take hold in the city, especially on and around the Dal lake, with houseboats being built to accommodate British officers and their families who came in the summers seeking respite from the heat of the plains of northern India. The Shergarhi Palace was greatly modified by the Dogras, who used it as their official residence in the city. Pratap Singh and his successor Hari Singh also laid out several parks in the city. The city expanded rapidly between 1891 and 1941, partly due to increased migration from the countryside as a result of famines and due to improvements in sanitation and urban development as well as economic expansion, in particular the growth of the textile and tourism industries in the city. Many Punjabis also settled in Srinagar during this time for trade, commerce and administration.

Srinagar emerged as the hub of political activity within the Kashmir valley during later Dogra rule. Kashmiris at large despised the Dogra rule and considered the dynasty an &quot;alien rule&quot;. Many Muslim leaders competed for influence and control over Muslim shrines in the city through which they sought to become representatives of Kashmiri Muslims. Sheikh Abdullah, and his National Conference (NC), eventually succeeded in doing so.

===Partition and Independence===
In 1947, after the princely state&#x27;s accession to India following an invasion of the state by Pakistani irregulars in the aftermath of the partition of India, Indian forces were airlifted to Srinagar on 27 October to defend the city and the larger Kashmir valley. The National Conference also established a popular people&#x27;s militia in the city to aid the army in their defence of the territory. Srinagar became the summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir when it was established in 1952.

In 1963–1964, the relic at the Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar briefly disappeared, causing political turmoil. Following this, the shrine was reconstructed between 1968 and 1979 in a Mughal-inspired style.
In 1989, Srinagar became the focus of the insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir. The city saw increased violence against the minority Hindus—particularly the Kashmiri Pandits—during the insurgency which resulted in their ultimate exodus. Kashmiri Hindus constituted 8.39% of Srinagar&#x27;s population in the 1981 census and 2.75% in the 2011 census. The Gawakadal massacre took place in the city in January 1990, resulting in 50–100 deaths. As a result, bunkers and checkpoints are found throughout the city, although their numbers have come down in the past few years as militancy has declined. However, protests still occur against Indian rule, with large demonstrations happening in 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2016. After revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and the subsequent devolution of the state into a union territory in August 2019, a lockdown was imposed in Kashmir, including in Srinagar.

==Geography==

The city is located on both the sides of the Jhelum River, called &quot;Vyath&quot; in Kashmir. The river passes through the city and meanders through the valley, moving onward and deepening in the Wular Lake. The city is known for its nine old bridges, connecting the two parts of the city.

There are a number of lakes and swamps in and around the city. These include the Dal, the Nigeen, the Anchar, Khushal Sar, Gil Sar and Hokersar.

Hokersar is a wetland situated near Srinagar. Thousands of migratory birds come to Hokersar from Siberia and other regions in the winter season. Migratory birds from Siberia and Central Asia use wetlands in Kashmir as their transitory camps between September and October and again around spring. These wetlands play a vital role in sustaining a large population of wintering, staging and breeding birds.

Hokersar is north of Srinagar, and is a world class wetland spread over including lake and marshy area. It is the most accessible and well-known of Kashmir&#x27;s wetlands which include Hygam, Shalibug and Mirgund. A record number of migratory birds have visited Hokersar in recent years.

Birds found in Hokersar are migratory ducks and geese which include brahminy duck, tufted duck, gadwall, garganey, greylag goose, mallard, common merganser, northern pintail, common pochard, ferruginous pochard, red-crested pochard, ruddy shelduck, northern shoveller, common teal, and Eurasian wigeon.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Srinagar has a four-season humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot summers and cool winters. The valley is surrounded by the Himalayas on all sides. Due to influence from Himalayan rain shadow and western disturbances, Srinagar has year-round precipitation; the spring season is the wettest while autumn is the driest. The region also has less rain in the summer due to lying in the leeward side of the rain shadow which blocks the monsoon winds from the south. Winters are colder in the region than most areas with monsoon climates due to these influences and its elevation, with daily maximum temperatures averaging in January and dropping below freezing point at night. 

Moderate to heavy snowfall occurs in winter and the highway connecting Srinagar with the rest of India faces frequent blockades due to icy roads, landslides and avalanches. Summers are warm to hot, slightly moderated from its elevation, with a July daytime average of . The average annual rainfall is around . The highest temperature reliably recorded is recorded on 10 July 1946, and the lowest is recorded on 6 February 1895.
Srinagar has been ranked 43rd best “National Clean Air City” (under Category 1 &gt;10L Population cities) in India.

==Economy==

In November 2011, the City Mayors Foundationan advocacy think tankannounced that Srinagar was the 92nd fastest growing urban areas in the world in terms of economic growth, based on actual data from 2006 onwards and projections to 2020.

===Tourism===
Srinagar is one of several places that have been called the &quot;Venice of the East&quot;. Lakes around the city include Dal Lakenoted for its houseboats and Nigeen Lake. Apart from Dal Lake and Nigeen Lake, Wular Lake and Manasbal Lake both lie to the north of Srinagar. Wular Lake is one of the largest fresh water lakes in Asia.

Srinagar has some Mughal gardens, forming a part of those laid by the Mughal emperors across the Indian subcontinent. Those of Srinagar and its close vicinity include Chashma Shahi (the royal fountains); Pari Mahal (the palace of the fairies); Nishat Bagh (the garden of spring); Shalimar Bagh; the Naseem Bagh.
Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Botanical Garden is a botanical garden in the city, set up in 1969. The Indian government has included these gardens under &quot;Mughal Gardens of Jammu and Kashmir&quot; in the tentative list for sites to be included in world Heritage sites.

The Sher Garhi Palace houses administrative buildings from the state government. Another palace of the Maharajas, the Gulab Bhavan, has now become the Lalit Grand Palace hotel.

The Shankaracharya Temple lies on a hill top in the middle of the city.

==Government and politics==
The city is run by the Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) under the leadership of a Mayor. The Srinagar district along with the adjoining Budgam and Ganderbal districts forms the Srinagar Parliamentary seat.Established in 1886, Srinagar Municipal Corporation comprises 74 wards and stretches over 227.34 sqkm within boundaries from North up to Pandach-Nagbal, North-East up to Harwan Bridge, East up to Zawoora-Zaafraan Colony, South-East up to Mahjoor Nagar-Natipora, South up to Baagh-i-Mahtaab, South-West up to Hamdaaniyah Colony, West up to Sozieth-Lawaypora and North-West up to Mujgund-Abdullahpora. SMC is organized into two wings - The deliberative wing (Mayor) and the Executive wing (Commissioner). The last elections were held in 2018.

SMC is involved in Sanitation, Town Planning, Revenue, Birth and Death, Development and Grievances. SMC has been successful in its efforts of e-Governance, Collection and Disposal of Solid Waste, Beautification and Creation of Green Spaces and Improvement of Drainage Networks. The organization has, however, failed to prevent Dood Ganga Pollution for which the J&amp;K Pollution Control Committee (JKPCC), on the direction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), has imposed a penalty as Environmental Compensation of more than Rs 41.67 crores on Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC).

===Stray dog controversy===
Srinagar&#x27;s city government attracted brief international attention in March 2008 when it announced a mass poisoning program aimed at eliminating the city&#x27;s population of stray dogs. Officials estimate that 100,000 stray dogs roam the streets of the city, which has a human population of just under 900,000. In a survey conducted by an NGO, it was found that some residents welcomed this program, saying the city was overrun by dogs, while critics contended that more humane methods should be used to deal with the animals.

The situation has become alarming with local news reports coming up at frequent intervals highlighting people, especially children being mauled by street dogs.

==Demographics==

As of 2011 census Srinagar urban agglomeration had a population of 1,206,419. Both the city and the urban agglomeration has average literacy rate of approximately 70%. The child population of both the city and the urban agglomeration is approximately 12% of the total population. Males constituted 53.0% and females 47% of the population. The sex ratio in the city area is 888 females per 1000 males, whereas in the urban agglomeration it is 880 per 1,000.

The predominant religion of Srinagar is Islam with 96% of the population being Muslim. Hindus constitute the second largest religious group representing 2.75% of the population, nearly all migrant workers from outside Kashmir as most local Kashmiri Hindus fled the city in the 1990s. The remaining population constitutes Sikhs, Buddhist and Jains. Kashmiri Hindus constituted 21.9% of Srinagar&#x27;s population as per 1891 census and 2.75% as per 2011 census.

At the time of the 2011 census, 95.14% spoke Kashmiri and 1.49% Hindi as their first language.

==Transport==

===Road===
The city is served by many highways, including National Highway 1A and National Highway 1D.
===Air===
Srinagar International Airport has regular domestic flights to Leh, Jammu, Chandigarh, Delhi and Mumbai and occasional international flights. An expanded terminal capable of handling both domestic and international flights was inaugurated on 14 February 2009 with Air India Express flights to Dubai. Hajj flights also operate from this airport to Saudi Arabia.

===Rail===

Srinagar is a station on the long Banihal-Baramulla line that started in October 2009 and connects Baramulla to Srinagar, Anantnag and Qazigund. The railway track also connects to Banihal across the Pir Panjal mountains through a newly constructed 11 km long Banihal tunnel, and subsequently to the Indian railway network after a few years. It takes approximately 9 minutes and 30 seconds for a train to cross the tunnel. It is the longest rail tunnel in India. This railway system, proposed in 2001, is not expected to connect the Indian railway network until 2017 at the earliest, with a cost overrun of 55 billion INR.
The train also runs during heavy snow.

There are proposals to develop a metro system in the city. The feasibility report for the Srinagar Metro is planned to be carried out by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.

===Cable car===

In December 2013, the 594m cable car allowing people to travel to the shrine of the Sufi saint Hamza Makhdoom on Hari Parbat was unveiled. The project is run by the Jammu and Kashmir Cable Car Corporation (JKCCC), and has been envisioned for 25 years. An investment of 300 million INR was made, and it is the second cable car in Kashmir after the Gulmarg Gondola.

===Boat===
While popular since the 7th century, water transport is now mainly confined to Dal Lake, where shikaras (wooden boats) are used for local transport and tourism. There are efforts to revive transportation on the River Jhelum.

<text>A5/1 is a stream cipher used to provide over-the-air communication privacy in the GSM cellular telephone standard. It is one of several implementations of the A5 security protocol. It was initially kept secret, but became public knowledge through leaks and reverse engineering. A number of serious weaknesses in the cipher have been identified.

==History and usage==
A5/1 is used in Europe and the United States. A5/2 was a deliberate weakening of the algorithm for certain export regions. A5/1 was developed in 1987, when GSM was not yet considered for use outside Europe, and A5/2 was developed in 1989. Though both were initially kept secret, the general design was leaked in 1994 and the algorithms were entirely reverse engineered in 1999 by Marc Briceno from a GSM telephone. In 2000, around 130 million GSM customers relied on A5/1 to protect the confidentiality of their voice communications.

Security researcher Ross Anderson reported in 1994 that &quot;there was a terrific row between the NATO signal intelligence agencies in the mid-1980s over whether GSM encryption should be strong or not. The Germans said it should be, as they shared a long border with the Warsaw Pact; but the other countries didn&#x27;t feel this way, and the algorithm as now fielded is a French design.&quot;

==Description==

A GSM transmission is organised as sequences of &quot;bursts&quot;. In a typical channel and in one direction, one burst is sent every 4.615 milliseconds and contains 114 bits available for information. A5/1 is used to produce for each burst a 114 bit sequence of keystream which is XORed with the 114 bits prior to modulation. A5/1 is initialised using a 64-bit key together with a publicly known 22-bit frame number. Older fielded GSM implementations using Comp128v1 for key generation, had 10 of the key bits fixed at zero, resulting in an effective key length of 54 bits. This weakness was rectified with the introduction of Comp128v3 which yields proper 64 bits keys. When operating in GPRS / EDGE mode, higher bandwidth radio modulation allows for larger 348 bits frames, and A5/3 is then used in a stream cipher mode to maintain confidentiality.

A5/1 is based around a combination of three linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) with irregular clocking. The three shift registers are specified as follows:
These degrees were not chosen at random: since the degrees of the three registers are relatively prime, the period of this generator is the product of the periods of the three registers. Thus the period of A5/1 (before repetition) is 2^64 bits (2 to the power of 64).

The bits are indexed with the least significant bit (LSB) as 0.

The registers are clocked in a stop/go fashion using a majority rule. Each register has an associated clocking bit. At each cycle, the clocking bit of all three registers is examined and the majority bit is determined. A register is clocked if the clocking bit agrees with the majority bit. Hence at each step at least two or three registers are clocked, and each register steps with probability 3/4.

Initially, the registers are set to zero. Then for 64 cycles, the 64-bit secret key K is mixed in according to the following scheme: in cycle formula_1, the &quot;i&quot;th key bit is added to the least significant bit of each register using XOR —
:formula_2
Each register is then clocked.

Similarly, the 22-bits of the frame number are added in 22 cycles. Then the entire system is clocked using the normal majority clocking mechanism for 100 cycles, with the output discarded. After this is completed, the cipher is ready to produce two 114 bit sequences of output keystream, first 114 for downlink, last 114 for uplink.

==Security==
A number of attacks on A5/1 have been published, and the American National Security Agency is able to routinely decrypt A5/1 messages according to released internal documents.

Some attacks require an expensive preprocessing stage after which the cipher can be broken in minutes or seconds. Originally, the weaknesses were passive attacks using the known plaintext assumption. In 2003, more serious weaknesses were identified which can be exploited in the ciphertext-only scenario, or by an active attacker. In 2006 Elad Barkan, Eli Biham and Nathan Keller demonstrated attacks against A5/1, A5/3, or even GPRS that allow attackers to tap GSM mobile phone conversations and decrypt them either in real-time, or at any later time.

According to professor Jan Arild Audestad, at the standardization process which started in 1982, A5/1 was originally proposed to have a key length of 128 bits. At that time, 128 bits was projected to be secure for at least 15 years. It is now believed that 128 bits would in fact also still be secure until the advent of quantum computing. Audestad, Peter van der Arend, and Thomas Haug says that the British insisted on weaker encryption, with Haug saying he was told by the British delegate that this was to allow the British secret service to eavesdrop more easily. The British proposed a key length of 48 bits, while the West Germans wanted stronger encryption to protect against East German spying, so the compromise became a key length of 54 bits.

===Known-plaintext attacks===
The first attack on the A5/1 was proposed by Ross Anderson in 1994. Anderson&#x27;s basic idea was to guess the complete content of the registers R1 and R2 and about half of the register R3. In this way the clocking of all three registers is determined and the second half of R3 can be computed.

In 1997, Golic presented an attack based on solving sets of linear equations which has a time complexity of 240.16 (the units are in terms of number of solutions of a system of linear equations which are required).

In 2000, Alex Biryukov, Adi Shamir and David Wagner showed that A5/1 can be cryptanalysed in real time using a time-memory tradeoff attack, based on earlier work by Jovan Golic. One tradeoff allows an attacker to reconstruct the key in one second from two minutes of known plaintext or in several minutes from two seconds of known plain text, but he must first complete an expensive preprocessing stage which requires 248 steps to compute around 300 GB of data. Several tradeoffs between preprocessing, data requirements, attack time and memory complexity are possible.

The same year, Eli Biham and Orr Dunkelman also published an attack on A5/1 with a total work complexity of 239.91 A5/1 clockings given 220.8 bits of known plaintext. The attack requires 32 GB of data storage after a precomputation stage of 238.

Ekdahl and Johansson published an attack on the initialisation procedure which breaks A5/1 in a few minutes using two to five minutes of conversation plaintext. This attack does not require a preprocessing stage. In 2004, Maximov &quot;et al.&quot; improved this result to an attack requiring &quot;less than one minute of computations, and a few seconds of known conversation&quot;. The attack was further improved by Elad Barkan and Eli Biham in 2005.

===Attacks on A5/1 as used in GSM===

In 2003, Barkan &quot;et al.&quot; published several attacks on GSM encryption. The first is an active attack. GSM phones can be convinced to use the much weaker A5/2 cipher briefly. A5/2 can be broken easily, and the phone uses the same key as for the stronger A5/1 algorithm. A second attack on A5/1 is outlined, a ciphertext-only time-memory tradeoff attack which requires a large amount of precomputation.

In 2006, Elad Barkan, Eli Biham, Nathan Keller published the full version of their 2003 paper, with attacks against A5/X сiphers. The authors claim: 

In 2007 Universities of Bochum and Kiel started a research project to create a massively parallel FPGA-based cryptographic accelerator COPACOBANA. COPACOBANA was the first commercially available solution using fast time-memory trade-off techniques that could be used to attack the popular A5/1 and A5/2 algorithms, used in GSM voice encryption, as well as the Data Encryption Standard (DES). It also enables brute force attacks against GSM eliminating the need of large precomputed lookup tables.

In 2008, the group The Hackers Choice launched a project to develop a practical attack on A5/1. The attack requires the construction of a large look-up table of approximately 3 terabytes. Together with the scanning capabilities developed as part of the sister project, the group expected to be able to record any GSM call or SMS encrypted with A5/1, and within about 3–5 minutes derive the encryption key and hence listen to the call and read the SMS in clear. But the tables weren&#x27;t released.

A similar effort, the A5/1 Cracking Project, was announced at the 2009 Black Hat security conference by cryptographers Karsten Nohl and Sascha Krißler. It created the look-up tables using Nvidia GPGPUs via a peer-to-peer distributed computing architecture. Starting in the middle of September 2009, the project ran the equivalent of 12 Nvidia GeForce GTX 260. According to the authors, the approach can be used on any cipher with key size up to 64-bits.

In December 2009, the A5/1 Cracking Project attack tables for A5/1 were announced by Chris Paget and Karsten Nohl. The tables use a combination of compression techniques, including rainbow tables and distinguished point chains. These tables constituted only parts of the 1.7 TB completed table and had been computed during three months using 40 distributed CUDA nodes and then published over BitTorrent. More recently the project has announced a switch to faster ATI Evergreen code, together with a change in the format of the tables and Frank A. Stevenson announced breaks of A5/1 using the ATI generated tables.

Documents leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013 state that the NSA &quot;can process encrypted A5/1&quot;.

===Using A5/1 as pseudorandom generator===

Since the degrees of the three LFSRs are relatively prime, the period of this generator is the product of the periods of the three LFSRs, which represents 2^64 bits (2 to the power of 64).

One might think of using A5/1 as pseudo-random generator with a 64-bit initialization seed (key size), but it is not reliable. It loses its randomness after only 8 MB (which represents the period of the largest of the three registers).

<doc id="294156" wikidata="Q164904" url="?curid=294156" title="Taishan, Guangdong">
<text>Taishan (), alternately romanized in Cantonese as Toishan or Toisan, in local dialect as Hoisan, and formerly known as Xinning or Sunning (), is a county-level city in the southwest of Guangdong province, China. It is administered as part of the prefecture-level city of Jiangmen. During the 2020 census, there were 907,354 inhabitants (941,095 in 2010), but only 433,266 were considered urban. Taishan calls itself the &quot;First Home of the Overseas Chinese&quot;. An estimated half a million Chinese Americans are of Taishanese descent.

==Geography==
Taishan is in the Pearl River Delta, in southwestern Jiangmen Prefecture. It has 95 islands and islets, including Shangchuan Island, Guangdong&#x27;s largest island now that Hainan is a separate province. Taishan is one of Guangdong&#x27;s &quot;Four Counties&quot; (&quot;Sze Yup&quot;), which excluded Heshan and is now part of the Greater Taishan Region.

===Climate===
==History==
During the Ming dynasty, the area of present-day Taishan was carved out of Xinhui County on 12 February 1499 as &quot;Xinning County&quot;. By the 19th century, Xinning was already a source of migrant and emigrant workers, but a series of subsequent natural and political disasters in the area exacerbated the situation. Aside from the disruption of the Sea Ban regulations (&quot;Haijin&quot;) themselves, their revocation led to an influx of northern settlers who began long-running feuds with the returning locals; this erupted into full-scale war in the 1850s and &#x27;60s. The 1842 Treaty of Nanking that ended the First Opium War opened China to greater foreign trade just before the California Gold Rush made the prospect of emigration to the United States appealing. Many also served as contract workers abroad, as in Hawaii, Peru and Cuba and—most famously—for the Central Pacific half of America&#x27;s Transcontinental Railroad, where the Chinese made up 80% of the company&#x27;s workforce as they laid track over the mountains and deserts of the west. By 1870, there were 63,000 Chinese in the U.S., almost all in California.

Chin Gee Hee&#x27;s Sun Ning Railway Company connected Sun Ning (Xinning) with its hinterland in 1908 and reached Jiangmen (Kongmoon) in 1913. It was notable as one of only three railways financed, built, owned, and run by the Chinese themselves before the 1949 Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War.

In 1914, the new Republican government renamed the area Taishan County to avoid confusion with other places named Xinning. (Foreign sources now frequently confuse it with Mount Tai in Shandong.) During the Second World War, the Sun Ning Railway was destroyed to prevent its use by the Japanese. Japanese soldiers entered Taicheng, the county seat, in March 1941 and killed nearly 280 people. One quarter of the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;, a joint American and Chinese group of airmen who fought the Japanese before the U.S. entered the Second World War, hailed from Taishan.

Taishan was promoted to county-level city status on 17 April 1992, reflecting its increasing level of urbanization.

==Administration==

Taishan administers one subdistrict and 16 towns, which in turn are subdivided into 313 administrative villages (), and residential communities (). The city has 3,655 natural villages, but they do not function as administrative divisions ().

Taishan&#x27;s township-level divisions are:
Some of the city&#x27;s natural villages include Annanjiangchao (), Bihou (), Jilong, and Guanbuli ().

==Demographics==
Counting the total Greater Taishan Region or Sze Yap Region, which includes Kaiping, Xinhui, Enping and Taishan, there are about 8 to 9 million Taishanese people worldwide. According to American historian Him Mark Lai, approximately 430,000 or 70% of Chinese Americans in the 1980s were Taishanese according to 1988 data. About 500,000 Chinese Americans claim Taishanese origins today.

While Taishan itself has a population of about 1 million, there are around 1.3 million Taishanese people overseas, distributed in 91 countries and regions. It is estimated that, up to the mid- to late-20th century, over 75% of all overseas Chinese in North America claimed origin in Taishan, so Taishan has been called the &quot;Home of Overseas Chinese&quot;.

===Language===
Taishan&#x27;s main dialect is Taishanese (). Most Taishanese today use Mandarin in school or formal occasions, but Taishanese is the &quot;lingua franca&quot;. Schools require their students to speak Mandarin in the classroom, and teachers are required to lecture in Mandarin.

Taishanese is a language of the Yue Chinese, a large group that includes, but is broader than, the Cantonese spoken in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Cantonese and Taishanese are thus related but distinct. Cantonese is also widely known in Taishan, as it serves as Guangdong Province&#x27;s &quot;lingua franca&quot;.

Before the 1980s, Taishanese was the predominant Chinese language spoken throughout North America&#x27;s Chinatowns.

== Economy ==
In 2018, Taishan&#x27;s GDP reached 43.25 billion Yuan, government revenue was 2.92 billion Yuan, fixed-asset investment was 27.33 billion Yuan, retail sales totaled 25.52 billion Yuan, and foreign trade totaled 13.76 billion Yuan.

=== Power generation ===
Taishan is home to two major power plants: the Guohua Taishan Power Station and the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant.

==Culture==
=== Sports ===
Taishan is nicknamed the &quot;hometown of volleyball&quot;, after the game was introduced to the city in 1915 by Lingnan University student Wu Xiumin (). Many prominent Chinese volleyball players have hailed from Taishan. In recent years, local governments in the city have invested in the area&#x27;s volleyball programs, and the city hosted a number of Volleyball Women&#x27;s Nations League matches in 2018. 9-man is a form of volleyball from Taishan brought to American Chinatowns by Taishanese immigrants.

=== Music and Entertainment ===
Taishan and Guangzhou are the birthplaces of Guangdong music.

Parts of the movie &quot;Let the Bullets Fly&quot; were filmed in Taishan in 2010.

==Education==
Education enjoys significant support from Overseas Chinese professionals and businessmen. Many secondary schools were built and financed by Chinese living in China&#x27;s Special Administrative Regions, as well as various foreign countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Brazil. To honor their benefactors, these schools often bear either their names or the names of said donor&#x27;s parents.

The Peng Quan School () is a prime example, which was constructed during 1999–2001 and is now integrated into Taishan&#x27;s public school system. It is situated on the west side of Taicheng and was built by a Hong Kong businessman.

There are many middle schools and high schools in Taishan but no academic universities. Students must study rigorously in order to be accepted at universities located in other cities.

Taishan schools include:

University:
* Taishan Panshi Television University ()

Secondary schools (including combined junior-senior high schools and senior high schools):

* Taishan No. 1 High School ()
* Taishan Overseas Chinese Middle School ()
* Taishan Peiying Vocational Technical School ()

<text>William Vacanarat Shadrach Tubman (29 November 1895 – 23 July 1971) was a Liberian politician. He was the 19th president of Liberia and the longest-serving president in the country&#x27;s history, serving from his election in 1944 until his death in 1971.

Tubman is regarded as the &quot;father of modern Liberia&quot; in that during his presidency sufficient foreign investment was attracted to modernize the country&#x27;s economy and infrastructure. During his tenure, Liberia experienced a period of prosperity. He also led a policy of national unification to reduce the social and political differences between his fellow Americo-Liberians and the indigenous Liberians.

==Early life and family background==
William Tubman was born on 29 November 1895, in Harper, which is located in southeastern Liberia. He was one of 5 children, who grew up poor. He was also a descendant of people who were formerly enslaved in the U.S. Tubman&#x27;s grandfather, Alexander Tubman, was a stonemason, general in the Liberian army, and a former Speaker of the Liberian House of Representatives, as well as a Methodist preacher. Tubman&#x27;s father was a strict disciplinarian. He required his five children to attend daily family prayer services, and to sleep on the floor because he thought beds were too soft and &quot;degrading to character development&quot;. Tubman&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Rebecca (née Barnes) Tubman, was from Atlanta, Georgia. Alexander&#x27;s parents, Sylvia and William Shadrach Tubman, were freedmen, part of a group of 69 freed slaves whose transportation to Liberia in 1844 was paid by their former mistress Emily Harvie Thomas Tubman, a widow and philanthropist in Augusta, Georgia.

Emily Tubman was instrumental in the manumission of enslaved African Americans and paying for their transportation to Liberia for &quot;repatriation&quot;. Initially, she had great difficulty freeing her slaves in ante-bellum Georgia. Despite appeals to the Georgia State Legislature and financial donations to the University of Georgia, her efforts to manumit numerous slaves were disapproved. After Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion in 1831, the state legislature had greatly restricted manumissions, requiring a legislative act for each, and posting of expensive bonds by the owner to guarantee the free black would leave the state within a short period of time.

Tubman sought the help of her friend and mentor, Henry Clay of Kentucky, president of the American Colonization Society. This organization, made up of both abolitionists and slaveholders, had proposed colonization in Africa as a solution for freedmen, rather than allowing them to remain in the United States. Their presence was considered to unsettle slaves in the South, and in both the North and South, lower-class whites resented competing with them for jobs. Clay assured her that sending her former slaves to Liberia would be a safe and suitable option. After arriving in Liberia, this group of freedmen took &quot;Tubman&quot; as their surname and settled together. They named their community &quot;Tubman Hill&quot; after their benefactress.

==Education==
William Tubman, the second son, went to primary school in Harper, followed by the Methodist Cape Palmas Seminary, and Harper County High School. Beginning in 1910, when he was 15, he participated in several military operations within the country through 1917, being promoted from private to officer.

Planning to become a preacher, at age 19 Tubman was named as a Methodist lay preacher. After studying law under various private tutors, he passed the bar examination and became a lawyer in 1917.

==Early career==
Tubman was soon appointed as a recorder in the Maryland County Monthly and Probate Court a tax collector, teacher, and as colonel in a militia.

He was a Freemason and belonged to lodges of Prince Hall Freemasonry.

==Elective office==
Having joined the True Whig Party (TWP), which had been the dominant political party in Liberia since 1878, Tubman began his career in politics. In 1923, aged 28, he was elected to the Senate of Liberia from Maryland County, holding the record as the youngest senator in the history of Liberia. Identifying as the &quot;Convivial Cannibal from the Downcoast Hinterlands,&quot; he fought for constitutional rights for the members of indigenous tribal groups, who comprised the overwhelming number of Liberians.

Re-elected as senator in 1929, Tubman became the legal adviser to vice president Allen Yancy. He resigned from the Senate in 1931 to defend Liberia before the League of Nations amid allegations that his country was using slave labor. Tubman was reelected to the national legislature in 1934; he resigned in 1937 after being appointed by President Edwin Barclay as associate justice of the Supreme Court of Liberia, where he served until 1943. An official biography speculates that Barclay appointed Tubman to the Liberian Supreme Court to remove him as a competitor for the presidency.

==President of Liberia==
In December 1942, Liberia had to elect a successor to President Edwin Barclay. Six candidates ran for office; the two favorites were Tubman and Foreign Minister Clarence L. Simpson. Tubman was elected president on 4 May 1943, at the age of 48, and was inaugurated 3 January 1944.

While the United States, its ally, began to base military operations in the country after it entered World War II, Liberia did not declare war on Germany and Japan until 27 January 1944. In April 1944, Liberia joined the Allied cause by signing the Declaration by United Nations.

Choosing to sever diplomatic relations with Germany and expel German citizens from Liberia was a difficult decision for Tubman for economic and social reasons: (1) German merchants were integral to the Liberian economy; (2) Germany was Liberia&#x27;s major trading partner; and (3), most of the doctors in Liberia were Germans. Under the above declaration, Tubman agreed to expel all German residents and oppose the Axis powers.

===Foreign relations===

In foreign policy, Tubman aligned his country with the US, which he hailed as &quot;Our strongest, closest, and most reliable friend.&quot; In June 1944, he and former president, Edwin Barclay, traveled to the White House as guests of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and became the first African heads of state to be received there. Following the war, which resulted in an anti-colonial movement on the African continent, Tubman strengthened ties among fellow Africans by participating in the Asian-African Conference of 1955, and the First Conference of Independent African States in Accra, organized in 1958 by Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana. In 1959, Tubman organized the Second Conference of African States.

In 1951 the United States and Liberia signed a mutual agreement of defense.

In 1957, the United States erected a Voice of America relay facility, one of several U.S. communications facilities to be placed on Liberian soil during the Cold War.

In 1961, following a Pan-African conference held in Monrovia, Tubman helped to found the African Union. This association of &quot;moderate&quot; African leaders worked for gradual unification of Africa, unlike the &quot;revolutionary&quot; group based at Casablanca.

A U.S Peace Corps program began in Liberia which would run until 1990 when Civil war broke out.

Tubman&#x27;s government was critical of communism, and avoided establishing diplomatic relations with most of the communist countries (Yugoslavia, which was regarded highly by the Liberian government, was the lone exception); however, Liberia did exchange trade and goodwill missions with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European states.

===Economic development===

When Tubman was appointed to the Supreme Court in the 1930s, Liberia was seriously underdeveloped, lacking basic infrastructure of roads, railways, and sanitation systems. Tubman said that Liberia had never received the &quot;benefits of colonization&quot;, by which he meant the investment by a wealthy major power to develop the infrastructure of the country. He established an economic policy, known as the &quot;porte ouverte&quot; (&quot;open door&quot;), to attract foreign investment. Working to facilitate and encourage foreign businesses to locate in Liberia, he encouraged development. Between 1944 and 1970, the value of foreign investments, mainly from the United States, increased by 200%. From 1950 to 1960, Liberia experienced an average annual growth of 11.5%.

With the expansion of the economy, Tubman gained revenues for the government to construct and modernize infrastructure: the streets of Monrovia were paved, a public sanitation system was installed, hospitals were built, and a literacy program was launched in 1948. During Tubman&#x27;s administration, several thousand kilometers of roads were built, as was a railway line to connect the iron mines to the coast for transport of this commodity for export. During this period, he transformed the Port of Monrovia into a free port to encourage trade.

By early 1960, Liberia began to enjoy its first era of prosperity, thanks in part to Tubman&#x27;s policies and implementation of development. It was during this time that Tubman became regarded as a pro-Western, stabilizing influence in West Africa, at a period when other countries were achieving independence—often amid violence. During the 1960s, Tubman was courted by many Western politicians, notably U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.

In the past, the bulk of Liberia&#x27;s production depended on rubber. But with the modernization of the state&#x27;s infrastructure at the hands of Tubman, Liberia started to use its other national resources. Several Americo-Liberian nationalities, German, and Swedish companies became involved in the exploitation of iron mines—making Liberia the first source of iron in Africa, and the fourth worldwide. Tubman wanted to diversify the economy, rather than basing it on rubber and iron resources, which made up 90% of the country&#x27;s exports. He encouraged the development of coffee plantations, palm oil, sugar cane, and especially rice cultivation in 1966 (with the help of Taiwan).

In his personal life, Tubman courted Amy Ashwood Garvey, and had a long-term relationship with her.

=== Role in the Cold War ===
As World War II gave way to the Cold War, the United States viewed Liberia as an ideal post from which to fight the spread of communism through Africa. Under Tubman, Liberia voted with the U.S. on most key matters at the United Nations, although it sometimes sided with other African states, particularly on decolonization and anti-apartheid issues. Tubman gradually extended ties to the Soviet bloc, but he supported the United States on the Vietnam War, as did his successor, William R. Tolbert.

=== Assessment ===

His former ally and later political opponent S. David Coleman and his son John were hunted down and killed by Liberian soldiers for allegedly plotting to overthrow him. The Coleman funeral was poorly attended, as people were afraid of being seen as Coleman sympathizers. That same year the constitution was changed to allow Tubman to stay in office for more than two terms.

In 1961 Tubman declared a state of emergency after riots and a strike took place. In July 1965, Raymond J. Horace and three other individuals involved in the 1955 attempted assassination of Tubman were released from prison. As a result of labor unrest, Tubman was granted emergency powers by the parliament for twelve months.

By the time Tubman died, Liberia had the largest mercantile fleet in the world.

<doc id="294164" wikidata="Q7331708" url="?curid=294164" title="Rick Salutin">
<text>Rick Salutin (born August 30, 1942) is a Canadian novelist, playwright, journalist, and critic and has been writing for more than forty years. Until October 1, 2010, he wrote a regular column in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;; on February 11, 2011, he began a weekly column in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;.

He currently teaches a half course on Canadian media and culture in University College (CDN221) at the University of Toronto. He is a contributing editor of &quot;This Magazine&quot;. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Near Eastern and Jewish Studies at Brandeis University and got his Master of Arts degree in religion at Columbia University. He also studied philosophy at the New School for Social Research in New York City. He was once a trade union organizer in Toronto and participated in the Artistic Woodwork strike.

Salutin is interested in communication and has praised Harold Innis, an economist who taught at the University of Toronto and conceived of the staples thesis, for his outlook in communications. Salutin has a child with &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; journalist Theresa Burke, whom he has cited as the model for the characters Amy Bert and Antia in &quot;The Womanizer&quot;.

==Journalism==
Salutin has written in many magazines, including &quot;Harpers&quot;, &quot; Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Canadian Business&quot;, &quot;Toronto Life&quot;, &quot;Weekend&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;Quest&quot;, &quot;TV Times&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, and &quot;This Magazine&quot;. He wrote &quot;The Culture Vulture&quot; column for many years in &quot;This Magazine&quot; and received National Newspaper awards for it. He won the National Newspaper Award for best columnist for a column he wrote in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

He introduced cartoon strips to &quot;This Magazine&quot; and convinced Margaret Atwood to regularly collaborate. She made a cartoon strip called &quot;Kanadian Kultchur Komics&quot;.

In &quot;Waiting for Democracy: A Citizen&#x27;s Journal&quot; (1989), he expresses his thoughts on the federal election in 1989 and writes about interviewing people before the election.

==Drama==
Salutin has an interest in drama and performing arts. His first play, &quot;Fanshen&quot;, unpublished, was adapted from William Hinton&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; and was produced by Toronto Workshop Productions. &quot;The Adventures of an Immigrant&quot; shows that he is concerned about poverty and other hardships in Western society. His unpublished &quot;Maria&quot; was a drama on CBC Television about a woman fighting to put factory workers in the union.

His first published play was &quot;1837: The Farmers&#x27; Revolt&quot; about the revolt led by William Lyon Mackenzie. This play was created at Theatre Passe Muraille and produced on CBC Television in 1975. &quot;1837&quot; won the Chalmers award for best Canadian play in 1977.

His most successful play, &quot;Les Canadiens&quot; (1977), written with help from goaltender Ken Dryden, won him the Chalmers Outstanding Play award.

Salutin helped found the Guild of Canadian Playwrights and in 1978 became chairman. Another play he wrote is &quot;Joey&quot; (1981).

==Novels==
His first novel, &quot;A Man of Little Faith&quot;, is about a religious man discovering himself in a Jewish community. It received the W.H. Smith Books in Canada First Novel Award. His books &quot;Marginal Notes: Challenges to the Mainstream&quot; and &quot;Living in a Dark Age&quot; are based on many of his articles from &quot;This Magazine&quot;. He won the Toronto Arts award for writing and publishing.

==Book review==
Taken from a book review of &quot;The Womanizer&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s both lively and witty, but not as light as it might seem on first glance.&quot;

<doc id="294165" wikidata="Q287908" url="?curid=294165" title="United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379">
<text>United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, adopted on 10 November 1975, &quot;&quot;Determines&quot; that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination&quot; with 72 votes in favour, 35 votes against, and 32 abstentions. It was revoked by Resolution 46/86, adopted on 16 December 1991 with 111 votes in favour, 25 votes against, and 13 abstentions. The vote for Resolution 3379 was held nearly one year after the adoption of Resolution 3236 and Resolution 3237: the former recognized the &quot;Question of Palestine&quot; and invited the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to participate in international diplomacy; and the latter designated the PLO as a non-member Assembly observer following the &quot;&quot; by Palestinian political leader Yasser Arafat.

In the context of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, adopted on 10 November 1963, Resolution 3379 officially condemned the national ideology of the State of Israel. It was sponsored by the Arab League and a number of Muslim-majority countries, and was chiefly supported by in-favour votes from the Second World and many African countries. Israel, which had been granted United Nations membership in 1949, voted against Resolution 3379 and subsequently condemned it, and was chiefly supported by the First World.

== Background ==
=== Jewish nationalism in Palestine ===
In July 1920, at the San Remo conference, a Class &quot;A&quot; League of Nations mandate over Palestine was allocated to the British. The preamble of the mandate document declared:
Whereas the Principal Allied Powers have also agreed that the Mandatory should be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on November 2nd, 1917, by the Government of His Britannic Majesty, and adopted by the said Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. 

=== UN Partition Plan for Palestine ===
On 29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution recommending &quot;to the United Kingdom, as the mandatory Power for Palestine, and to all other Members of the United Nations the adoption and implementation, with regard to the future government of Palestine, of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union&quot; as Resolution 181 (II). The plan contained a proposal to terminate the British Mandate for Palestine and partition Palestine into &quot;independent Arab and Jewish States and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem.&quot; On 14 May 1948, the day on which the British Mandate over Palestine expired, the Jewish People&#x27;s Council gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum, and approved a proclamation which declared &quot;the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel&quot;.

On 11 May 1949, Israel was admitted to membership in the United Nations.

== Votes of Resolution 3379 ==


== Response ==
=== Israel ===

In his address to the United Nations General Assembly the same day, 10 November 1975, Israeli Ambassador Chaim Herzog stated:
Herzog ended his statement, while holding a copy of the resolution, with these words: As he concluded his speech, Herzog tore the resolution in half.

The name of the &quot;UN Avenue&quot; in Haifa, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv was switched to the &quot;Zionism Avenue&quot; as a response to the UN&#x27;s decision.

=== United States ===
Before the vote, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, warned that, &quot;The United Nations is about to make anti-Semitism international law.&quot; He delivered a speech against the resolution, including the famous line, &quot;[The United States] does not acknowledge, it will not abide by, it will never acquiesce in this infamous act ... A great evil has been loosed upon the world.&quot;

In Campbell, California, in the United States, a group of high school students attempted to solicit signatures on the premises of a local shopping center for a petition against Resolution 3379. The result was the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins&quot; (1980) that supported states&#x27; rights to expand the exercise of free speech, which California held was legal in what were considered public areas of a shopping mall.

Mexico&#x27;s vote in favor of the resolution led some United States Jews to organize a tourism boycott of Mexico. This ended after Mexican foreign minister Emilio Óscar Rabasa made a trip to Israel (Rabasa shortly afterward was forced to resign).

== Revocation ==

United Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/86, adopted on 16 December 1991, revoked Resolution 3379&#x27;s designation of Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. Israel had made the revocation a condition for its participation in the Madrid Conference of 1991. The vote on Resolution 46/86 was held shortly after the Gulf War with sponsorship by 88 countries, including the overwhelming majority of both the First World and the Second World, and was chiefly supported by many African countries. The Arab League, most Muslim-majority countries, and four other countries (Cuba, North Korea, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam) voted against it.

In total, the motion to revoke Resolution 3379 received 111 votes in favour, 25 votes against, and 13 abstentions.

=== Motion by the United States ===
Resolution 46/86 was raised under pressure from the United States, and American president George H. W. Bush personally introduced the motion to revoke Resolution 3379 with the following statement:

=== Text of Resolution 46/86 ===
The full text of the revocation was simply:

&quot;The General Assembly decides to revoke the determination contained in its resolution 3379 (XXX) of 10 November 1975.&quot;

=== Votes of Resolution 46/86 ===

== Legacy ==
On 21 June 2004, while inaugurating the first United Nations conference on the issue of antisemitism, the Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan stated that &quot;the actions of the United Nations on the issue of antisemitism have not always been worthy of its ideals. It is deplorable that the General Assembly adopted in 1975 a resolution which assimilated Zionism with racism and I welcome that it later came back on its position&quot;.

<text>Winthrop Rockefeller (May 1, 1912 – February 22, 1973) was an American politician and philanthropist. Rockefeller was the fourth son and fifth child of American financier John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. He was one of the grandchildren of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller. As an entrepreneur in Arkansas, he financed many local projects, including a number of new medical clinics in poorer areas, before being elected state governor in 1966, as the first Republican governor of Arkansas since Reconstruction. Despite accusations of lacking insight into the concerns of low-income voters, Rockefeller was re-elected in 1968, and went on to complete the integration of Arkansas schools.

==Early life==
Winthrop Rockefeller was born in New York, to philanthropists John Davison Rockefeller Jr. and socialite, Abigail Greene &quot;Abby&quot; Aldrich. He is one of the grandsons of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller. He had one elder sister named Abby, three elder brothers John III, Nelson, and Laurance, and a younger brother named David. Nelson served as Governor of New York and Vice President of the United States under Gerald Ford.

Winthrop attended Yale University (1931–1934) before resigning to go work in the oil industry. Prior to attending Yale, he graduated from the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut.

On January 22, 1941, he enlisted as a private in the Army, while the United States was still neutral during World War II. He was initially assigned to the 26th Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division. He was later assigned to the 77th Infantry Division. He eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the 77th Division he served in the invasions of Guam and Leyte in the Philippines. He earned a Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Clusters and a Purple Heart for his actions aboard the troopship USS &quot;Henrico&quot;, after a kamikaze attack during the invasion of Okinawa. His image appears in the Infantry Officer Hall of Fame at Fort Benning, Georgia.

==Political career==
===First campaigns===
Rockefeller resigned his position with the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission and conducted his first campaign for governor in 1964 against Orval Faubus. His campaign was ultimately unsuccessful, but Rockefeller energized and reformed the tiny Republican Party to set the stage for the future. In 1964, Osro Cobb, a Republican former state chairman who had also served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, refused to endorse Rockefeller but openly endorsed Faubus, who subsequently gave Cobb a temporary appointment to the Arkansas Supreme Court.

In his memoirs, Cobb recalls that Rockefeller

had used ruthless tactics to convert the fine Republican state organization into a one-man Rockefeller machine, loyal not to party but to Rockefeller personally. In rapid succession, Mr. Rockefeller captiously took over most of the functions of the state chairman and in a matter of months succeeded in taking over and exercising absolute right of dictation as to each and every important party function at the state level. Such one-man dictatorship is clearly the deadly enemy of any semblance of two-party government. ... Faithful Republican leaders who have worked tirelessly over the years have been pushed aside or replaced. ... A stranger passing through Arkansas at this time and seeing Mr. Rockefeller&#x27;s advertising on billboards would not know whether Mr. Rockefeller belonged to any political party. Certainly the fact that he is the Republican nominee has not been included. The evidence simply is unanswerable that Mr. Rockefeller is working for his own personal interest to the exclusion of all other considerations, which leaves the Republican Party in Arkansas hanging precariously at the whims of one individual ... .

===1966 gubernatorial election===
When Rockefeller made his second run in the 1966 election, only 11 percent of Arkansans considered themselves Republicans. But Arkansans had tired of Faubus after six terms as governor and as head of the Democratic &quot;machine&quot;. Democrats themselves seemed to be more interested in the reforms that Rockefeller offered in his campaign than &quot;winning another one for the party&quot;. An odd coalition of Republicans and Democratic reform voters catapulted Rockefeller into the governor&#x27;s office, as he defeated a segregationist Democratic former Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, James D. Johnson of Conway in Faulkner County, who preferred the appellation &quot;Justice Jim&quot;.

Former state Republican chairman Osro Cobb reversed himself in 1966 and endorsed Rockefeller. He explains:

Arkansas Republicans were eager to work with Winthrop Rockefeller on another race for governor if he could be led to run as a true Republican to help build the party in the state. I liked him personally. He showed me many courtesies, and I still thought [despite feelings in 1964] that he would make a good governor and could be elected on the Republican ticket. ... He had learned a lesson. And he won his next two races for governor. ... His service contributed greatly to the enormous benefits of two-party government in Arkansas.

At the time Winthrop became governor, his brother Nelson Rockefeller had been the governor of New York since 1959, and remained so throughout Winthrop&#x27;s four years in office. They are often erroneously cited as the first two brothers to be governors at the same time, but they were actually the third case; the previous instances were Levi and Enoch Lincoln from 1827 to 1829, and John and William Bigler from 1852 to 1855. More recently, George W. and Jeb Bush were both governors from 1999 to 2000.

At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Winthrop Rockefeller received backing from members of the Arkansas delegation as a &quot;favorite son&quot; presidential candidate. He received all of his state&#x27;s 18 votes; his brother Nelson, then concluding a major presidential bid against Richard M. Nixon, received 277. This was the only time in the 20th century that the names of two brothers were placed into nomination at the same time.

===Governor of Arkansas 1967-1971===
The Rockefeller administration enthusiastically embarked on a series of reforms but faced a hostile Democratic legislature. Rockefeller endured a number of personal attacks and a concerted whispering campaign regarding his personal life.

Scholars Diane Blair and Jay L. Barth continue: &quot;As long as Rockefeller led the Arkansas Republicans, the party had a progressive, reformist cast, and those whom Rockefeller had brought into the party continued to dominate party offices and shape presidential preferences until 1980,&quot; when the nomination and election of Ronald Reagan of California as president and Frank D. White as governor moved power within the state GOP &quot;sharply to the right.&quot; Ultimately the growth of the Republican Party was slower in Arkansas than in the other southern states in the post-segregation era. Blair and Barth attribute sluggish GOP development to &quot;tradition, [which] is important to rural people. They are looking for ways to stay with the Democratic Party; they have to be run off.&quot;

According to his biographer, Cathy Kunzinger Urwin, Rockefeller&#x27;s &quot;good-government&quot; reform proposals included: revision of the Arkansas State Constitution, governmental administrative reorganization, election law reform (a &quot;little Hatch Act&quot; to prohibit state employees from engaging in political activities on the job), teacher tenure, taxpayer-funded kindergarten under Amendment 53, adult and continuing education programs, rehabilitation and vocational training in the corrections system, and the recurring attempts at industrial recruitment. One of Rockefeller&#x27;s most publicized &quot;good-government&quot; reforms was the ending of illegal gambling in the resort city of Hot Springs. He also made headway in streamlining state government and secured passage of a state minimum-wage law.

Urwin determined that Rockefeller&#x27;s negatives created public perceptions of &quot;his personal flaws, rather than his accomplishments or lack of them, as governor.&quot; Considered a weak administrator, he depended too heavily on staff, so improperly managed that the employees often failed to answer mail. He was habitually tardy to meetings. A special legislative session in May 1968 was particularly disastrous. An Oliver Quayle poll in 1968 declared that Rockefeller seemed &quot;strange, alien, and foreign&quot; to many voters. The poll maintained that many thought Rockefeller sought too much power, that he drank too much, and that he spent too little time in his office. A majority said that the wealthy Rockefeller, despite his interest in &quot;good government,&quot; could not understand the problems of common people on restricted incomes or those in the middle class with limited investment opportunities.

Rockefeller had a particular interest in the reform of the Arkansas prison system. Soon after his election he had received a shocking report from the Arkansas State Police on the brutal conditions within the prison system. He decried the &quot;lack of righteous indignation&quot; about the situation and created a new Department of Corrections. He appointed a new warden, academic Tom Murton, the first professional penologist that the state had ever retained in that capacity. However, he fired Murton less than a year later, when Murton&#x27;s aggressive attempts to expose decades of corruption in the system subjected Arkansas to nationwide contempt.

Rockefeller also focused on the state&#x27;s lackluster educational system and proposed funding increases for new buildings and teacher salaries when the legislature allowed.

Much of Rockefeller&#x27;s second term was spent in conflict with the opposition legislature. In 1969, he told the lawmakers that his reelection the previous November had meant that a slim majority of voters had approved of tax increases. He proposed to spend half of the new revenues sought on education, 12 percent on health and welfare, 10 percent on local government, and the remainder on state employee salaries and streamlined services. &quot;There are no frills in what I am proposing ... . no luxuries ... . no monuments to me as an individual ... . I implore every member of the General Assembly as I have myself: Listen to the voice of the people ... . not to the selfish interests.&quot;

Ernest Dumas, then with the since defunct &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; in Little Rock noted that the Rockefeller revenue package was essentially dead-on-arrival in both houses of the legislature though parts of the program were enacted piecemeal in the subsequent administration of the Democrat Dale Bumpers. Dumas describes Rockefeller as the &quot;most liberal governor in Arkansas history&quot; in light of his attempts to increase taxes to augment the size and scope of state government as well as steadfast support for civil rights and opposition to capital punishment.

During this term Rockefeller quietly and successfully completed the integration of Arkansas schools that had been such a political bombshell only a few years before. He established the Council on Human Relations despite opposition from the legislature. Draft boards in the state boasted the highest level of racial integration of any U.S. state by the time that Rockefeller left office. He was also the only governor from a Southern state to hold a public memorial for Martin Luther King Jr.

In 1970, the Arkansas GOP under Rockefeller hired its first paid executive director, Neal Sox Johnson of Nashville in Howard County. Johnson left the position in 1973 to take a high position with the former Farmers Home Administration in Washington, D.C., and was replaced by Ken Coon, who carried the party&#x27;s gubernatorial banner in 1974 against David Pryor.

===1970 gubernatorial election===
In the 1970 campaign, Rockefeller expected to face Orval Faubus, who led the old-guard Democrats, but the previously unknown Dale Bumpers of Charleston in Franklin County rose to the top of the Democratic heap by promising reforms. Bumpers&#x27; charisma and &quot;fresh face&quot; were too much for an incumbent Republican to overcome. Rockefeller lost his third-term bid, but he had inadvertently propelled the Democrats to reform their own party.

With the 1970 elections, the Republicans were reduced to a single member of each legislative chamber, Preston Bynum of Siloam Springs in the House and Jim Caldwell in the Senate. Danny Patrick, elected with Rockefeller in 1966 and 1968, went down to defeat in Madison and Carroll counties at the hands of Stephen A. Smith, who at twenty-one became Arkansas&#x27; youngest-ever state legislator, a designation that Patrick himself had taken only four years earlier. Smith later became a top aide to Bill Clinton in his first term as Governor.

As a dramatic last act, Governor Rockefeller, a longtime death penalty opponent, commuted the sentences of every prisoner on Arkansas&#x27;s death row and urged the governors of other states to do likewise. Thirty-three years later, in January 2003, Illinois&#x27; lame duck governor, George Ryan, would do the same, granting blanket commutations to the 167 inmates then sentenced to death in the state.

==Personal life==

An article in Texas Monthly alleges Candace Johnson née Weatherby, later to become the well-known Houston socialite Candy Mossler, was involved with Winthrop Rockefeller during his military service in the South.

On February 14, 1948, Winthrop married actress Jievute &quot;Bobo&quot; Paulekiute (September 6, 1916 – May 19, 2008). She was previously married to Boston Brahmin socialite John Sears Jr. The wedding took place in Florida, and at the reception, a choir sang Negro spirituals. On September 17, 1948, she gave birth to their son, Winthrop Paul &quot;Win&quot; Rockefeller.

The couple separated in 1950 and divorced in 1954. Bobo got custody of Win.

On June 11, 1956, Rockefeller wed the Seattle-born socialite Jeanette Edris (1918–1997). She had two children, Bruce and Ann Bartley, from a previous marriage. Winthrop and Jeanette had no children together and divorced shortly after he left the governorship in 1971.

As the state&#x27;s First Lady, Jeanette Rockefeller took a special interest in mental health issues.

In September 1972, Rockefeller was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer and endured a devastating round of chemotherapy. When he returned to Arkansas the populace was shocked at his gaunt and haggard appearance.

Winthrop Rockefeller died February 22, 1973, in Palm Springs, California, at the age of sixty. His body was cremated, and his ashes were interred at Winrock Farms in Morrilton, Arkansas.

==Legacy==
The legacy of Winthrop Rockefeller lives on in the form of numerous charities, scholarships, and the activities of the &quot;Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation&quot; and the &quot;Winthrop Rockefeller Charitable Trust&quot;, including Winrock International, an international nonprofit organization based in Little Rock, Arkansas whose mission is to empower disadvantaged people, increase economic opportunity, and sustain natural resources. The Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation provides funding for projects across Arkansas to encourage economic development, education, and racial and social justice. In 1964, he founded Museum of Automobiles on Petit Jean Mountain, which after his death in 1973 was given to the Arkansas State Parks system; a non-profit organization was formed to run the museum; in March 2007, the Charitable Trust pledged $100,000 for its ongoing operations if the museum raised an equal amount by the end of that year.

Founded in 2005, the Winthrop Rockefeller Institute (commonly called the Institute) is a nonprofit organization on Petit Jean Mountain that seeks to continue Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller’s collaborative approach to creating transformational change and a 509(a)(3) supporting organization of the University of Arkansas System. The &quot;Winthrop Rockefeller Charitable Trust&quot; gifted the Institute a $100 million endowment in 2018, which is held by the University of Arkansas Foundation.

Rockefeller&#x27;s political legacy lives on in both the Republican and Democratic parties of Arkansas, both of which were forced to reform as a result of his presence on the state scene.

Rockefeller was the subject of the December 2, 1966, cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

Winthrop Rockefeller&#x27;s son and only child, Win, served as Arkansas lieutenant governor, having won a special election in 1996 to succeed Mike Huckabee. Winthrop Paul Rockefeller then won two full four-year terms in 1998 and 2002. Like his father, Win Paul Rockefeller&#x27;s political career was cut short by a devastating cancer.

The Winrock Shopping Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is named for Rockefeller. He developed the center in a relationship with the University of New Mexico.

During his tenure as chairman of Colonial Williamsburg, Winthrop was a frequent visitor at the foundation&#x27;s Carter&#x27;s Grove Plantation eight miles away in James City County, Virginia. He is credited with helping develop a plan with Gussie Busch in the early 1970s to turn a portion of the large tract of undeveloped land between the two points into the massive Anheuser-Busch (AB) investment there, which included building a large brewery, the Busch Gardens Williamsburg theme park, the Kingsmill planned resort community, and McLaws Circle, an office park. AB and related entities from that development plan now are the source of the area&#x27;s largest employment base, surpassing both Colonial Williamsburg and the local military bases.

<doc id="294171" wikidata="Q70827" url="?curid=294171" title="Water Margin">
<text>Water Margin, also called Outlaws of the Marsh or All Men Are Brothers, is a Chinese novel from the Ming dynasty that is one of the preeminent Classic Chinese Novels. Attributed to Shi Nai&#x27;an, &quot;Water Margin&quot; was one of the earliest Chinese novels written in vernacular Mandarin Chinese. 

The story, which is set in the Northern Song dynasty (around 1120), tells of how a group of 108 outlaws gathers at Mount Liang (or &quot;Liangshan&quot; Marsh) to rebel against the government. Later they are granted amnesty and enlisted by the government to resist the nomadic conquest of the Liao dynasty and other rebels. While the book&#x27;s authorship is traditionally attributed to Shi Nai&#x27;an (1296–1372), the first external reference to the novel only appeared in 1524 during the Jiajing reign of the Ming dynasty, sparking a long-lasting academic debate on when it was actually written and which historical events the author had witnessed that inspired him to write the book.

The novel is considered one of the masterpieces of early vernacular fiction and Chinese literature. It has introduced readers to some of the best-known characters in Chinese literature, such as Wu Song, Lin Chong, Pan Jinlian, Song Jiang and Lu Zhishen. &quot;Water Margin&quot; also exerted a significant influence on the development of fiction elsewhere in East Asia, such as on Japanese literature.

==Historical context and development==
&quot;Water Margin&quot; is based on the exploits of the outlaw Song Jiang and his 108 companions (The 36 &quot;Heavenly Spirits&quot; (三十六天罡) and the 72 &quot;Earthly Demons&quot; (七十二地煞)). The group was active in the Huainan region and surrendered to the Song government in 1121. They were recorded in the historical text &quot;History of Song&quot; in the annals of Emperor Huizong of Song, which states:

Zhang Shuye&#x27;s biography further describes the activities of Song Jiang and the other outlaws, and tells they were eventually defeated by Zhang.

Folk stories about Song Jiang circulated during the Southern Song. The first known source to name Song Jiang&#x27;s 36 companions was &quot;Miscellaneous Observations from the Year of Guixin&quot; (癸辛雜識) by Zhou Mi, written in the 13th century. Among the 36 are Lu Junyi, Guan Sheng, Ruan Xiao&#x27;er, Ruan Xiaowu, Ruan Xiaoqi, Liu Tang, Hua Rong and Wu Yong. Some of the characters who later became associated with Song Jiang also appeared around this time. They include Sun Li, Yang Zhi, Lin Chong, Lu Zhishen and Wu Song.

A palace memorial by Hou Meng, included in the &quot;History of Song&quot;, states: &quot;Song Jiang and 36 others cross Qi and Wei (the central belt of the North China Plain) at will. Government troops number tens of thousands but no one dares oppose him. His abilities must be extraordinary. Since we also face plunders by Fang La and his outlaws from Qingxi, why not grant Song Jiang and his men amnesty and request them to lead a campaign against Fang La to redeem themselves?&quot;

A direct precursor of &quot;Water Margin&quot; is &quot;Old Incidents in the Xuanhe Period of the Great Song Dynasty&quot; (大宋宣和遺事), which appeared around the mid-13th century. The text is a written version of storytellers&#x27; tales based on supposed historical events. It is divided into ten chapters, roughly covering the history of the Song dynasty from the early 11th century to the establishment of the Southern Song regime in 1127. The fourth chapter covers the adventures of Song Jiang and his 36 companions, and their eventual defeat by Zhang Shuye. Versions of some of the stories and characters in &quot;Water Margin&quot; are clearly visible, including &quot;Yang Zhi Sells His Precious Sabre&quot;, &quot;Robbing the Convoy of Birthday Gifts&quot;, &quot;Song Jiang Kills Yan Poxi&quot;, and &quot;Fighting Fang La&quot;. Song Jiang and his outlaws are said to operate in the Taihang Mountains.

Stories about the outlaws became a popular subject for Yuan dynasty drama. During this time, the material on which &quot;Water Margin&quot; was based evolved into its current form. The number of outlaws increased to 108. Even though they come from different backgrounds, and include scholars, fishermen, imperial drill instructors, officers, and others, all of them eventually come to occupy Mount Liang (or Liangshan Marsh).

===Author&#x27;s inspiration and dates===
While the book&#x27;s authorship is attributed to Shi Nai&#x27;an (1296–1372), there is an extensive academic debate on what historical events the author had witnessed that inspired him to write the book, which forms a wider debate on when the book was written. The first external reference of this book, which dated to 1524 during a discussion among Ming dynasty officials, is a reliable evidence because it presents strong falsifiability. Other scholars put the date to the mid-14th century, sometime between the fall of the Mongol-ruled Yuan dynasty and the early Ming dynasty.

Both the Jiajing reign of the Ming dynasty (1521–1568) and the closing years of the Mongol-ruled Yuan dynasty (1360s) were marked by a chain of rebellions, which confused scholars a lot as to which of the two inspired the author, and hence when was the book written. The proponents of the Yuan dynasty argued that &quot;Water Margin&quot; became popular during the Yuan as the common people (predominantly Han Chinese) resented the Mongol rulers. The ambivalence persisted into later times, and the Chongzhen Emperor of the Ming dynasty, acting on the advice of his ministers, banned the book.

==Plot==
The opening episode in the novel is the release of the 108 Spirits, imprisoned under an ancient stele-bearing tortoise.

The next chapter describes the rise of Gao Qiu, one of the primary antagonists of the story. Gao abuses his status as a Grand Marshal by oppressing Wang Jin; Wang&#x27;s father taught Gao a painful lesson when the latter was still a street-roaming ruffian. Wang Jin flees from the capital with his mother and by chance he meets Shi Jin, who becomes his apprentice. The next few chapters tell the story of Shi Jin&#x27;s friend Lu Zhishen, followed by the story of Lu&#x27;s sworn brother Lin Chong. Lin Chong is framed by Gao Qiu for attempting to assassinate him, and almost dies in a fire at a supply depot set by Gao&#x27;s henchmen. He slays his foes and abandons the depot, eventually making his way to Liangshan Marsh, where he becomes an outlaw. Meanwhile, the &quot;Original Seven&quot;, led by Chao Gai, rob a convoy of birthday gifts for the Imperial Tutor Cai Jing, another primary antagonist in the novel. They flee to Liangshan Marsh after defeating a group of soldiers sent by the authorities to arrest them, and settle there as outlaws with Chao Gai as their chief. As the story progresses, more people come to join the outlaw band, including military personnel and civil officials who grew tired of serving the corrupt government, as well as men with special skills and talents. Stories of the outlaws are told in separate sections in the following chapters. Connections between characters are vague, but the individual stories are eventually pieced together by chapter 60 when Song Jiang succeeds Chao Gai as the leader of the band after the latter is killed in a battle against the Zeng Family Fortress.

The plot further develops by illustrating the conflicts between the outlaws and the Song government after the Grand Assembly of the 108 outlaws. Song Jiang strongly advocates making peace with the government and seeking redress for the outlaws. After defeating the imperial army in a great battle at Liangshan Marsh, the outlaws eventually receive amnesty from Emperor Huizong. The emperor recruits them to form a military contingent and sends them on campaigns against invaders from the Liao dynasty and rebel forces led by Tian Hu, Wang Qing and Fang La within the Song dynasty&#x27;s domain. Although the former outlaws eventually emerge victorious against the rebels and Liao invaders, the campaigns also lead to the tragic dissolution of the 108 heroes. At least two-thirds of them die in battle while the surviving ones either return to the imperial capital to receive honours from the emperor and continue serving the Song government, or leave and spend the rest of their lives as commoners elsewhere. Song Jiang himself is eventually poisoned to death by the &quot;Four Treacherous Ministers&quot; – Gao Qiu, Yang Jian, Tong Guan and Cai Jing.

===Characters===
The 108 Heroes (一百单八将) are at the core of the plot of &quot;Water Margin&quot;. Based on the Taoist concept that each person&#x27;s destiny is tied to a &quot;Star of Destiny&quot; (宿星), the 108 Stars of Destiny are stars representing 108 demonic overlords who were banished by the deity Shangdi. Having repented since their expulsion, the 108 Stars are accidentally released from their place of confinement, and are reborn in the world as 108 heroes who band together for the cause of justice. They are divided into the 36 Heavenly Spirits and 72 Earthly Fiends.

===Table of chapters===
This outline of chapters is based on a 100 chapters edition. Yang Dingjian&#x27;s 120 chapters edition includes other campaigns of the outlaws on behalf of Song dynasty, while Jin Shengtan&#x27;s 70 chapters edition omits the chapters on the outlaws&#x27; acceptance of amnesty and subsequent campaigns.

The extended version includes the Liangshan heroes&#x27; expeditions against the rebel leaders Tian Hu and Wang Qing prior to the campaign against Fang La.

Other stories are told such as the heroes fighting the Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty or moving to Siam.

==Reception and themes==

&quot;Water Margin&quot;, praised as an early &quot;masterpiece&quot; of vernacular fiction, is renowned for the &quot;mastery and control&quot; of its mood and tone. The novel is also known for its use of vivid, humorous and especially racy language. However, it has been denounced as &quot;obscene&quot; by various critics since the Ming dynasty.
Susan L. Mann writes that the &quot;desire for male camaraderie&quot; is &quot;far from a mere plotline,&quot; for it is a basic theme of this and other classic novels. She places the novel&#x27;s male characters in a tradition of men&#x27;s culture of mutual trust and reciprocal obligation, such as figures known as the Chinese knight-errant. Sima Qian, the Han dynasty historian, devoted a section to biographies: &quot;Their words were always sincere and trustworthy, and their actions always quick and decisive. They were always true to what they promised, and without regard to their own persons, they would rush into dangers threatening others.&quot; She finds such figures in this and other novels, such as &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, all of which dramatized the &quot;empathic emotional attraction between men who appreciate and play off against one another&#x27;s complementary qualities.&quot;

Licentious and treacherous women are another recurring theme. Modern critics have debated whether &quot;Water Margin&quot; is misogynistic. Most beautiful women in the novel are depicted as immoral and cruel, and they are often involved in schemes against the protagonists. Among them is Pan Jinlian, the sister-in-law of Wu Song, who has later become an archetypal femme fatale and one of the most notorious villainesses of Chinese culture. On the other hand, the few &quot;good&quot; women in the story, like Sun Erniang and Gu Dasao, are not particularly noted for their beauty, or are even described as being plain or ugly. The leader of the outlaws, Song Jiang admonishes: &quot;Any outlaw that meddles with women is contemptible.&quot;

Critics offer various explanations for &quot;Water Margin&quot;&#x27;s prejudice against women. Most common among modern Chinese critics is the patriarchal society of the Imperial China. Professor Sun Shuyu of The Chinese University of Hong Kong argues that the author(s) of &quot;Water Margin&quot; intentionally vilified women in order to discipline their would-be-outlaw audiences.

In addition, the novel is notable for its gruesome and often gory and over-the-top depictions of violence. Some of the protagonists of the novel engage in &quot;wanton killing, excessive retribution, and various forms of cannibalism&quot;. When celebrating a victory, it is suggested they sometimes &quot;share their enemies&#x27; flesh piece by piece, an action combining cannibalism with &quot;lingchi&quot;&quot;, the slow slicing of somebody to death. This type of violent imagery in the novel is mentioned in a &quot;causal tone&quot;, with human flesh being eaten not just &quot;in acts of revenge&quot;, but also &quot;as a way of living&quot;. Noting that the outlaws celebrated in the novel were nevertheless widely regarded as &quot;heroes and heroines&quot; over centuries, educator William Sin states that one cannot divide &quot;the meanings of [their] actions&quot; from &quot;the cultural background under which they [were] performed&quot; and that it would be &quot;hasty&quot; to project concepts and values of today &quot;onto the situation of a distant culture&quot; where they may not have applied.

==Authorship==
Since fiction was not at first a prestigious genre in the Chinese literary world, authorship of early novels was often not carefully attributed and may be unknowable. The authorship of &quot;Water Margin&quot; is still in some sense uncertain, and the text in any case derived from many sources and involved many editorial hands. While the novel was traditionally attributed to Shi Nai&#x27;an, of whose life nothing is reliably known, recent scholars think that the novel, or portions of it, may have been written or revised by Luo Guanzhong (the author of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;). Other contenders include Shi Hui (施惠) and Guo Xun (郭勛).

===Shi Nai&#x27;an===
Many scholars believe that the first 70 chapters were indeed written by Shi Nai&#x27;an; however the authorship of the final 30 chapters is often questioned, with some speculating that it was instead written by Luo Guanzhong, who may have been a student of Shi. Another theory, which first appeared in Gao Ru&#x27;s &quot;Baichuan Shuzhi&quot; (百川書志) during the Ming dynasty, suggests that the whole novel was written and compiled by Shi, and then edited by Luo.

Shi drew from oral and written texts that had accumulated over time. Stories of the Liangshan outlaws first appeared in &quot;Old incidents in the Xuanhe period of the great Song dynasty&quot; (大宋宣和遺事) and had been circulating since the Southern Song dynasty, while folk tales and opera related to &quot;Water Margin&quot; have already existed long before the novel itself came into existence. This theory suggests that Shi Nai&#x27;an gathered and compiled these pieces of information to write &quot;Water Margin&quot;.

===Luo Guanzhong===
Some believe that &quot;Water Margin&quot; was written entirely by Luo Guanzhong. Wang Daokun (汪道昆), who lived during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor in the Ming dynasty, first mentioned in &quot;Classification of Water Margin&quot; (水滸傳敘) that: &quot;someone with the family name Luo, who was a native of Wuyue (Yue (a reference to the southern China region covering Zhejiang), wrote the 100-chapter novel.&quot; Several scholars from the Ming and Qing dynasties, after Wang Daokun&#x27;s time, also said that Luo was the author of &quot;Water Margin&quot;. During the early Republican era, Lu Xun and Yu Pingbo suggested that the simplified edition of &quot;Water Margin&quot; was written by Luo, while the traditional version was by Shi Nai&#x27;an.

However, Huikang Yesou (惠康野叟) in &quot;Shi Yu&quot; (識餘) disagree with Wang Daokun&#x27;s view on the grounds that there were significant differences between &quot;Water Margin&quot; and &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, therefore these two novels could not have been written by the same person.

Hu Shih felt that the draft of &quot;Water Margin&quot; was done by Luo Guanzhong, and could have contained the chapters on the outlaws&#x27; campaigns against Tian Hu, Wang Qing and Fang La, but not invaders from the Liao dynasty.

Another theory states that Luo Guanzhong was from the Southern Song period vice the Ming dynasty. Cheng Muheng (程穆衡) suggested in &quot;Notes on Water Margin&quot; (水滸傳注略) that Luo lived in the late Southern Song dynasty and early Yuan era. Huang Lin&#x27;gen (黃霖根) pointed out that the name of one of the compilers of &quot;Anecdotes of Jingkang&quot; (靖康稗史) was Nai&#x27;an, and suggested that this &quot;Nai&#x27;an&quot;, who lived during the Southern Song dynasty, was Shi Nai&#x27;an. He also felt that Shi wrote a simplified version of &quot;Water Margin&quot;, which is not the current edition.

===Shi Hui===
Another candidate is Shi Hui (施惠), a &quot;nanxi&quot; (&quot;southern opera&quot;) playwright who lived between the late Yuan dynasty and early Ming dynasty. Xu Fuzuo (徐復祚) of the Ming dynasty mentioned in &quot;Sanjia Cunlao Weitan&quot; (三家村老委談) that Junmei (君美; Shi Hui&#x27;s courtesy name)&#x27;s intention in writing &quot;Water Margin&quot; was to entertain people, and not to convey any message. During the Qing dynasty, Shi Hui and Shi Nai&#x27;an were linked, suggesting that they are actually the same person. An unnamed writer wrote in &quot;Chuanqi Huikao Biaomu&quot; (傳奇會考標目) that Shi Nai&#x27;an&#x27;s given name was actually &quot;Hui&quot;, courtesy name &quot;Juncheng&quot; (君承), and he was a native of Hangzhou. Sun Kaidi (孫楷第) also wrote in &quot;Bibliography of Chinese Popular Fiction&quot; that &quot;Nai&#x27;an&quot; was Shi Hui&#x27;s pseudonym. Later studies revealed that &quot;Water Margin&quot; contained lines in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang variety of Chinese, and that &quot;You Gui Ji&quot; (幽闺记), a work of Shi Hui, bore some resemblance to &quot;Water Margin&quot;, hence the theory that &quot;Water Margin&quot; was authored by Shi Hui.

===Guo Xun===
Early scholars attributed the authorship to Guo Xun (郭勛), a politician who lived in the Ming dynasty. Shen Defu (沈德符), a late Ming dynasty scholar, mentioned in &quot;Wanli Yehuo Bian&quot; (萬曆野獲編) that Guo wrote &quot;Water Margin&quot;. Shen Guoyuan (沈國元) added in &quot;Huangming Congxin Lu&quot; (皇明從信錄) that Guo mimicked the writing styles of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Water Margin&quot; to write &quot;Guochao Yinglie Ji&quot; (國朝英烈記). Qian Xiyan (錢希言) also stated in &quot;Xi Gu&quot; (戲嘏) that Guo edited &quot;Water Margin&quot; before. Hu Shih countered in his &quot;Research on Water Margin&quot; (水滸傳新考) that Guo Xun&#x27;s name was used as a disguise for the real author of &quot;Water Margin&quot;. Dai Bufan (戴不凡) had a differing view, as he suspected that Guo wrote &quot;Water Margin&quot;, and then used &quot;Shi Nai&#x27;an&quot; to conceal his identity as the author of the novel 

==Editions==

The textual history of the novel is extraordinarily complex for there are early editions of varying lengths, different parts, and variations. The scholar Scott Gregory comments that the text could be freely altered by later editors and publishers who also could add prefaces or commentaries. Not until the early 20th-century were there studies which began to set these questions in order, and there is still disagreement. The earliest components of the &quot;Water Margin&quot; (in manuscript copies) were from the late 14th century. A printed copy dating from the Jiaqing reign (1507–1567) titled &quot;Jingben Zhongyi Zhuan&quot; (京本忠義傳), is preserved in the Shanghai Library. The earliest extant complete printed edition of &quot;Water Margin&quot; is a 100-chapter version published in 1589. An edition, with 120 chapters and an introduction by Yang Dingjian (楊定見), has been preserved from the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1573–1620) in the Ming dynasty. Yet other editions were published in the early Qing dynasty.

The most widely read version is a truncated recension published by Jin Shengtan in 1643, reprinted many times, which became the standard text for later editions and most translations. Jin provided three introductions that praised the novel as a work of genius and inserted commentaries into the text that explained how to read the novel. He cut matter that he thought irrelevant, reduced the number of chapters to 70 by turning chapter 1 into a prologue, and added an ending in which all 108 heroes are executed.

The various editions can be classified into simplified and complex. The simplified editions, edited for less sophisticated audiences, can contain all the events but in less detail. There is no way of knowing whether a simplified edition came before or was derived from another by adding or cutting text.

===Simplified editions===
The simplified editions include stories on the outlaws being granted amnesty, followed by their campaigns against the Liao dynasty, Tian Hu, Wang Qing and Fang La, all the way until Song Jiang&#x27;s death. At one point, the later chapters were compiled into a separate novel, titled &quot;Sequel to Water Margin&quot; (續水滸傳), which is attributed to Luo Guanzhong.

Known simplified editions of &quot;Water Margin&quot; include:

* A 115-chapter edition, &quot;Masterpieces of the Han and Song dynasties&quot; (漢宋奇書)
* A 110-chapter edition, &quot;Chronicles of Heroes&quot; (英雄譜)
* A 164-chapter edition, combined with &quot;Sequel to Water Margin&quot;
* A 109-chapter edition, &quot;2-Carved Heroes&#x27; Compendium&quot;
* A 124-chapter version, &quot;Daodao Tang Edition&quot;
* A 104-chapter edition, &quot;Water Margin Chronicles Commentary&quot;

===Complex editions===
The complex editions are more descriptive and circulated more widely than their simplified counterparts. The three main versions of the complex editions are a 100-chapter, a 120-chapter and a 70-chapter edition. The most commonly modified parts of the complex editions are the stories on what happened after the outlaws are granted amnesty.

* 100-chapter edition: Includes the outlaws&#x27; campaigns against the Liao dynasty and Fang La after they have been granted amnesty.
* 120-chapter edition: An extended version of the 100-chapter edition, includes the outlaws&#x27; campaigns against Tian Hu and Wang Qing (chapters 91 to 110).
* 71-chapter edition: Edited by Jin Shengtan in the late Ming dynasty, this edition uses chapter 1 as a prologue and ends at chapter 71 of the original version, and does not include the stories about the outlaws being granted amnesty and their campaigns.
* There is another 120-chapter version known as &quot;Mei&#x27;s Collection Water Margin&quot;. The first 70 chapters of this version are consistent with Jin Shengtan&#x27;s Guanhuatang version, but the last 50 chapters are completely different from other versions. There is no plot of recruiting and Liangshan still fights against the government. There is controversy about the authenticity of the last 50 chapters of this version and the value of this version itself, with many people believing that the last 50 chapters were forged by Mei Jihe.

==Translations==
&quot;Water Margin&quot; has been translated into many languages. The book was translated into Manchu as Möllendorff: Sui hū bithe. Japanese translations date back to at least 1757, when the first volume of an early &quot;Suikoden&quot; (&quot;Water Margin&quot; rendered in Japanese) was printed. Other early adaptations include Takebe Ayakari&#x27;s 1773 &quot;Japanese Water Margin&quot; (&quot;Honcho suikoden&quot;), the 1783 &quot;Women&#x27;s Water Margin&quot; (&quot;Onna suikoden&quot;), and Santō Kyōden&#x27;s 1801 &quot;Chushingura Water Margin&quot; (&quot;Chushingura suikoden&quot;).

In 1805, Kyokutei Bakin released a Japanese translation of the &quot;Water Margin&quot; illustrated by Hokusai. The book, called the &quot;New Illustrated Edition of the Suikoden&quot; (&quot;Shinpen Suikogaden&quot;), was a success during the Edo period and spurred a Japanese &quot;Suikoden&quot; craze.

In 1827, publisher Kagaya Kichibei commissioned Utagawa Kuniyoshi to produce a series of woodblock prints illustrating the 108 heroes in &quot;Water Margin&quot;. The 1827–1830 series, called &quot;108 Heroes of the Water Margin&quot; or &quot;Tsuzoku Suikoden goketsu hyakuhachinin no hitori&quot;, catapulted Kuniyoshi to fame. It also brought about a craze for multicoloured pictorial tattoos that covered the entire body from the neck to the mid-thigh.

Following the great commercial success of the Kuniyoshi series, other ukiyo-e artists were commissioned to produce prints of the &quot;Water Margin&quot; heroes, which began to be shown as Japanese heroes rather than the original Chinese personages.

Among these later series was Yoshitoshi&#x27;s 1866–1867 series of 50 designs in Chuban size, which are darker than Kuniyoshi&#x27;s and feature strange ghosts and monsters.
A recent Japanese translation is 

The book was first translated into Thai in 1867, originally in Samud Thai (Thai paper book) format, consisting of 82 volumes in total. It was printed in western style in 1879 and distributed commercially by Dan Beach Bradley, an American Protestant missionary to Siam.

Jacques Dars translated the 70 chapter version into French in 1978, reprinted several times.

Pearl S. Buck was the first English translator of the entire 70-chapter version. Titled &quot;All Men are Brothers&quot; and published in 1933. The book was well received by the American public. However, it was also criticised for its errors, such as the mistranslation of Lu Zhishen&#x27;s nickname &quot;Flowery Monk&quot; as &quot;Priest Hua&quot;. In 1937, another complete translation appeared, titled &quot;Water Margin,&quot; by J. H. Jackson, edited by Fang Lo-Tien. A translation of Jin&#x27;s Preface was published in 1935 by the Shanghai journal, &quot;The China Critic&quot;.

Later translations of the 70 chapter version include Chinese-naturalised scholar Sidney Shapiro&#x27;s &quot;Outlaws of the Marsh&quot; (1980), which also does not include the verse. However, as it was published during the Cultural Revolution, this edition received little attention then. It is a translation of a combination of both the 70-chapter and 100-chapter versions.

The most recent translation, titled &quot;The Marshes Of Mount Liang&quot; (1994), by Alex and John Dent-Young, is a five-volume translation of the 120-chapter version. It includes a prologue but omits the foreword by Shi Nai&#x27;an and some passages related to the official details of the Ming Dynasty.

These translations differ in the selection of texts and completeness. The Jackson translation is the only translation to contain Shi Nai&#x27;an&#x27;s foreword. The Shapiro translation omits the prologue, the foreword, and most of the poems. The Dent-Young translation omits the author&#x27;s foreword and the passages concerning the Ming Dynasty administration and the translators admitted to compromising some details and retaining inconsistencies in their &quot;Brief Note on the Translation&quot;.

==Influence and adaptations==
===Literature===
&quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; is an erotic novel written under the pen-name Lanling Xiaoxiao Sheng (蘭陵笑笑生) (&quot;The Scoffing Scholar of Lanling&quot;) in the late Ming dynasty. The novel is based on the story of Wu Song avenging his brother in &quot;Water Margin&quot;, but the focus is on Ximen Qing&#x27;s sexual relations with other women, including Pan Jinlian. In &quot;Water Margin&quot;, Ximen Qing is killed by Wu Song for murdering the latter&#x27;s brother, while in &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; he dies a horrible death due to an accidental overdose of aphrodisiac pills.

&quot;Shuihu Houzhuan&quot; (水滸後傳), which roughly translates to &quot;The Later Story of Water Margin&quot;, is a novel written by Chen Chen (陳忱) in the Qing dynasty. The story is set after the end of the original &quot;Water Margin&quot;, with Li Jun as the protagonist. It tells of how the surviving Liangshan heroes are forced to become outlaws again due to corruption in the government. When the armies of the Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty invade the Song dynasty, the heroes rise up to defend their nation from the invaders. The heroes eventually decide to leave China for good and sail to distant lands. Apart from the surviving Liangshan heroes from the original novel, &quot;Shuihu Houzhuan&quot; also introduces new characters such as Hua Rong&#x27;s son Hua Fengchun (花逢春), Xu Ning&#x27;s son Xu Sheng (徐晟) and Huyan Zhuo&#x27;s son Huyan Yu (呼延鈺).

&quot;Dang Kou Zhi&quot; (蕩寇志), which roughly translates to &quot;The Tale of Eliminating Bandits&quot;, is a novel written by Yu Wanchun (俞萬春) during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor in the Qing dynasty. Yu disagreed that the Liangshan outlaws are loyal and righteous heroes, and was determined to portray them as ruthless mass murderers and destroyers, hence he wrote &quot;Dang Kou Zhi&quot;. The novel, which starts at the Grand Assembly of the 108 outlaws at Liangshan Marsh, tells of how the outlaws plundered and pillaged cities before they are eventually eliminated by government forces led by Zhang Shuye (張叔夜) and his lieutenants Chen Xizhen (陳希真) and Yun Tianbiao (雲天彪).

The Qing dynasty writer Qian Cai intertwined the life stories of Yue Fei and the outlaws Lin Chong and Lu Junyi in &quot;The Story of Yue Fei&quot; (1684). He stated that the latter were former students of the general&#x27;s martial arts tutor, Zhou Tong. However, literary critic C. T. Hsia commented that the connection was a fictional one created by the author. The Republican era folktale &quot;Swordplay Under the Moon&quot;, by Wang Shaotang, further intertwines Yue Fei&#x27;s history with the outlaws by adding Wu Song to the list of Zhou&#x27;s former students. The tale is set in the background of Wu Song&#x27;s mission to Kaifeng, prior to the murder of his brother. Zhou tutors Wu in the &quot;rolling dragon&quot; style of swordplay during his one-month stay in the capital city. It also said that Zhou is a sworn brother of Lu Zhishen and shares the same nickname with the executioner-turned-outlaw Cai Fu.

Frank Chin&#x27;s novel, &quot;Donald Duk&quot;, contains many references to the &quot;Water Margin&quot;. Song Jiang and Li Kui make several appearances in the protagonist&#x27;s dreams.

&quot;Rise of the Water Margin&quot; (水滸再起) is a novel launched in 2022 by the American author Christopher Bates in which all of the Chinese characters and their approximate character arcs are 21st century modernizations of people in &quot;The Water Margin&quot;. In this cyber-thriller, the characters of Lin Chong, Lu Da, Gao Qiu, Gao Yanei, Zhang Zhenniang, Fu An, Cai Jing, Chai Jin, Wang Lun, Zhu Gui, Zhao Ji, Li Shishi and many others appear. The location of Liangshanpo is a deserted ghost city known to its investors as Mount Liang Swamp, repurposed as a hacker enclave.

Eiji Yoshikawa wrote &quot;Shin Suikoden&quot; (新水滸伝), which roughly translates to &quot;New Tales from the Water Margin&quot;.

&quot;The Water Outlaws&quot;, a novel by S. L. Huang, is a gender-flipped version of the story in which the outlaws are queer women.

In addition to its colossal popularity in China, &quot;Water Margin&quot; has been identified as one of the most influential works in the development of early modern Japanese literature.

===Comics===
&quot;Water Margin&quot; is referred to in numerous Japanese manga, such as Tetsuo Hara and Buronson&#x27;s &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, and Masami Kurumada&#x27;s &quot;Fūma no Kojirō&quot;, &quot;Otokozaka&quot; and &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;. In both works of fiction, characters bearing the same stars of the &quot;Water Margin&quot; characters as personal emblems of destiny are featured prominently. A Japanese manga called &quot;&quot;, based on the story of &quot;Water Margin&quot;, was serialised in &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;.

A Hong Kong manhua series based on &quot;Water Margin&quot; was also created by the artist Lee Chi Ching. A reimagined series based on &quot;Water Margin&quot;, &quot;108 Fighters&quot;, was created by Andy Seto.

Between 1978 and 1988, the Italian artist Magnus published four acts of his work &quot;I Briganti&quot;, which places the &quot;Water Margin&quot; story in a setting that mixes Chinese, Western and science fiction (in Flash Gordon style) elements. Before his death in 1996, the four completed &quot;acts&quot; were published in a volume by Granata Press; two following &quot;acts&quot; were planned but never completed.

In 2007, Asiapac Books published a graphic narrative version of portions of the novel.

===Film===
Most film adaptations of &quot;Water Margin&quot; were produced by Hong Kong&#x27;s Shaw Brothers Studio and mostly released in the 1970s and 1980s.

<doc id="294172" wikidata="Q1293910" url="?curid=294172" title="John Godber">
<text>John Harry Godber (born 18 May 1956) is an English playwright, known mainly for observational comedies. The &quot;Plays and Players Yearbook&quot; of 1993 rated him the third most performed playwright in the UK after William Shakespeare and Alan Ayckbourn. He has been creative director of the Theatre Royal Wakefield since 2011.

==Early life and education==
Godber was born in Upton, West Riding of Yorkshire. He trained as a teacher of drama at Bretton Hall College, which was affiliated to the University of Leeds, and became artistic director of Hull Truck Theatre Company in 1984.

==Career==
Before venturing into plays, he was head of drama at Minsthorpe High School, the school he had attended as a student, and then wrote for the TV series &quot;Brookside&quot; and &quot;Grange Hill&quot;. While he was at Minsthorpe he taught future actors Adrian Hood (&quot;Preston Front&quot;, &quot;Up &#x27;n&#x27; Under&quot; film) and Chris Walker (&quot;Doctors&quot;, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;). A 1993 survey for &quot;Plays and Players&quot; magazine cited Godber as the third most performed playwright in the UK, after Shakespeare and Alan Ayckbourn. In 2005 he won two British Academy Children&#x27;s Awards for &quot;Oddsquad&quot;, written and directed on location in Hull and screened by BBC children&#x27;s television. His plays are performed across the world, &quot;Bouncers&quot; (1977) being the most popular.

In 2004 he became a visiting professor of Popular Theatre at Liverpool Hope University. He has also been professor of drama at Hull University. In 2011, Godber became creative director at Theatre Royal Wakefield and set up the John Godber Company as its resident company.

==Style==
Godber&#x27;s earlier style utilises an interest in German Expressionism, an economic and physical style inspired by this and the inspiration of Bretton Hall Head of School (Drama) John Hodgson. His later and more naturalistic style reflects his growth as a member of the middle classes and an Ayckbournesque world of drama. He says that the &quot;new Godber&quot; is perhaps a writer like Tim Firth.

==Personal life==
Godber is married to the writer and actress Jane Thornton, also known as Jane Clifford and Jane Godber.

==Legacy==
Godber is a Patron of the Second Chance Headway centre’s charity in Wakefield. 

The theatre facility at New College, Pontefract, a college near his birthplace, is named the John Godber Theatre. It opened in 2012.

<doc id="294174" wikidata="Q450197" url="?curid=294174" title="Frances Willard">
<text>Frances Elizabeth Caroline Willard (September 28, 1839 – February 17, 1898) was an American educator, temperance reformer, and women&#x27;s suffragist. Willard became the national president of Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in 1879 and remained president until her death in 1898. Her influence continued in the next decades, as the Eighteenth (on Prohibition) and Nineteenth (on women&#x27;s suffrage) Amendments to the United States Constitution were adopted. Willard developed the slogan &quot;Do Everything&quot; for the WCTU and encouraged members to engage in a broad array of social reforms by lobbying, petitioning, preaching, publishing, and education. 

Willard&#x27;s accomplishments include raising the age of consent in many states and passing labor reforms, most notably including the eight-hour work day. She also advocated for prison reform, scientific temperance instruction, Christian socialism, and the global expansion of women&#x27;s rights.

==Early life and education==

Willard was born in 1839 to Josiah Flint Willard and Mary Thompson Hill Willard in Churchville, near Rochester, New York. She was named after English novelist Frances (Fanny) Burney, the American poet Frances Osgood, and her sister, Elizabeth Caroline, who had died the previous year. She had two other siblings: her older brother, Oliver, and her younger sister, Mary. Her father was a farmer, naturalist, and legislator. Her mother was a schoolteacher. In 1841 the family moved to Oberlin, Ohio, where, at Oberlin College Josiah Willard studied for the ministry, and Mary Hill Willard took classes. They moved to Janesville, Wisconsin in 1846 for Josiah Willard&#x27;s health. In Wisconsin, the family, formerly Congregationalists, became Methodists. Frances and her sister Mary attended Milwaukee Normal Institute, where their mother&#x27;s sister taught.

In 1858, the Willard family moved to Evanston, Illinois, and Josiah Willard became a banker. Frances and Mary attended the North Western Female College (no affiliation with Northwestern University) and their brother Oliver attended the Garrett Biblical Institute.

==Teaching career==

After graduating from North Western Female College, Willard held various teaching positions throughout the country. She worked at the Pittsburgh Female College, and, as preceptress at the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary in New York (later Syracuse University). She was appointed president of the newly founded Evanston College for Ladies in 1871. When the Evanston College for Ladies became the Woman&#x27;s College of Northwestern University in 1873, Willard was named the first Dean of Women at the university. However, that position was to be short-lived with her resignation in 1874 after confrontations with the University President, Charles Henry Fowler, over her governance of the Woman&#x27;s College. Willard had previously been engaged to Fowler and had broken off the engagement.

==Activist (WCTU and suffrage)==
After her resignation, Willard focused her energies on a new career: the women&#x27;s temperance movement. In 1874, Willard participated in the founding convention of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) where she was elected the first Corresponding Secretary. In 1876, she became head of the WCTU Publications Department, focusing on publishing and building a national audience for the WCTU&#x27;s weekly newspaper, &quot;The Union Signal&quot;. In 1885 Willard joined with Elizabeth Boynton Harbert, Mary Ellen West, Frances Conant, Mary Crowell Van Benschoten (Willard&#x27;s first secretary) and 43 others to found the Illinois Woman&#x27;s Press Association.

In 1879, she sought and successfully obtained presidency of the National WCTU. Once elected, she held the post until her death. Her tireless efforts for the temperance cause included a 50-day speaking tour in 1874, an average of 30,000 miles of travel a year, and an average of 400 lectures a year for a 10-year period, mostly with the assistance of her personal secretary, Anna Adams Gordon.

Meanwhile, Willard sought to expand WCTU membership in the South, and met Varina Davis, the wife of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was secretary of the local chapter of the Women&#x27;s Christian Association in Memphis (where one daughter lived). Willard had tried and failed to convince Lucy Hayes (wife of President Rutherford B. Hayes) to assist the temperance cause, but writer Sallie F. Chapin, a former Confederate sympathizer who had published a temperance novel, supported Willard and was a friend of the Davises. In 1887, Davis invited Willard to her home to discuss the future of her unmarried daughter Winnie Davis, but both Davis women declined to become public supporters, in part because Jefferson Davis opposed legal prohibition. In 1887, Texas held a referendum on temperance, in part because former Confederate postmaster John Reagan supported temperance laws. When newspapers published a photograph of Willard handing Jefferson Davis a temperance button to give to his wife, Jefferson Davis publicly came out against the referendum (as contrary to states&#x27; rights) and it lost. Although Varina Davis and Willard would continue to correspond over the next decade (as Varina moved to New York after her husband&#x27;s death, and Willard spent most of her last decade abroad); another temperance referendum would not occur for two decades.

As president of the WCTU, Willard also argued for female suffrage, based on &quot;Home Protection,&quot; which she described as &quot;the movement … the object of which is to secure for all women above the age of twenty-one years the ballot as one means for the protection of their homes from the devastation caused by the legalized traffic in strong drink.&quot; The &quot;devastation&quot; referred to violent acts against women committed by intoxicated men, which was common both in and outside the home. Willard argued that it was too easy for men to get away with their crimes without women&#x27;s suffrage. The &quot;Home Protection&quot; argument was used to garner the support of the &quot;average woman,&quot; who was told to be suspicious of female suffragists by the patriarchal press, religious authorities, and society as a whole. The desire for home protection gave the average woman a socially appropriate avenue to seek enfranchisement. Willard insisted that women must forgo the notions that they were the &quot;weaker&quot; sex and that they must embrace their natural dependence on men. She encouraged women to join the movement to improve society: &quot;Politics is the place for woman.&quot; The goal of the suffrage movement for Willard was to construct an &quot;ideal of womanhood&quot; that allowed women to fulfill their potential as the companions and counselors of men, as opposed to the &quot;incumbrance and toy of man.&quot;

Willard&#x27;s suffrage argument also hinged on her feminist interpretation of Scripture. She claimed that natural and divine laws called for equality in the American household, with the mother and father sharing leadership. She expanded this notion of the home, arguing that men and women should lead side by side in matters of education, church, and government, just as &quot;God sets male and female side by side throughout his realm of law.&quot;

Willard&#x27;s work took to an international scale in 1883 with the circulation of the Polyglot Petition against the international drug trade. She also joined May Wright Sewall at the International Council of Women meeting in Washington, DC, laying the permanent foundation for the National Council of Women of the United States. She became the organization&#x27;s first president in 1888 and continued in that post until 1890. Willard also founded the World WCTU in 1888 and became its president in 1893. She collaborated closely with Lady Isabel Somerset, president of the British Women&#x27;s Temperance Association, whom she visited several times in the United Kingdom.

In 1892 she took part in the St. Louis convention during the formation of the People&#x27;s (or Populist) Party. The convention was brought a set of principles that was drafted in Chicago, Illinois, by her and twenty-eight of the United States&#x27; leading reformers, whom had assembled at her invitation. However, the new party refused to endorse women&#x27;s suffrage or temperance because it wanted to focus on economic issues.

After 1893, Willard was influenced by the British Fabian Society and became a committed Christian socialist.
==Death==
In 1898, Willard died quietly in her sleep at the Empire Hotel in New York City after contracting influenza while she was preparing to set sail for England and France. She is buried at Rosehill Cemetery, Chicago, Illinois.

Frances Willard and her sister Mary Thompson Hill Willard are interred at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago. She bequeathed her Evanston home to the WCTU. The Frances Willard House was opened as a museum in 1900 when it also became the headquarters for the WCTU. In 1965 it was elevated to the status of National Historic Landmark.

==Legacy==
The famous painting, &quot;American Woman and her Political Peers&quot;, commissioned by Henrietta Briggs-Wall for the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition, features Frances Willard at the center, surrounded by a convict, American Indian, lunatic, and an idiot. The image succinctly portrayed one argument for female enfranchisement: without the right to vote, the educated, respectable woman was equated with the other outcasts of society to whom the franchise was denied. 

After her death, Willard was the first woman included among America&#x27;s greatest leaders in Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. Her statue was designed by Helen Farnsworth Mears and was unveiled in 1905.
Willard is commemorated on a US postage stamp released on March 28, 1940, as part of the Famous Americans series.

The &quot;Frances Elizabeth Willard&quot; relief by Lorado Taft and commissioned by the National Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union in 1929 is in the Indiana Statehouse, Indianapolis, Indiana. The plaque commemorates the fiftieth anniversary of Willard&#x27;s election as president of the WCTU on October 31, 1879: &quot;In honor of one who made the world wider for women and more homelike for humanity Frances Elizabeth Willard Intrepid Pathfinder and beloved leader of the National and World&#x27;s Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union.&quot;

There&#x27;s a small memorial at Richardson Beach in Kingston, Ontario, Canada put there by the Kingston Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union on Sept. 28, 1939.

Willard appears as one of two main female protagonists in the young adult novel &quot;Bicycle Madness&quot; by Jane Kurtz.

In 2000, Willard was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

=== Namesakes ===

==Relationships==
Contemporary accounts described Willard&#x27;s friendships and her pattern of long-term domestic assistance from women. She formed the strongest friendships with co-workers. It is difficult to redefine Willard&#x27;s 19th-century life in terms of the culture and norms of later centuries, but some scholars describe her inclinations and actions as aligned with same-sex emotional alliance (what historian Judith M. Bennett calls &quot;lesbian-like&quot;).

==Controversy over civil rights issues==
In the 1890s, Willard came into conflict with African-American journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells. While trying to expose the evils of alcohol, Willard and other temperance reformers often depicted one of the evils as its effect to incite purported black criminality, thus implying that this was one of the serious problems requiring an urgent cure. The rift first surfaced during Wells&#x27; speaking tour of Britain in 1893, where Willard was also touring and was already a popular reformist speaker. Wells openly questioned Willard&#x27;s silence on lynching in the United States and accused Willard of having pandered to the racist myth that white women were in constant danger of rape from drunken black males to avoid endangering WCTU efforts in the South. She recounted a time when Willard had visited the South and blamed the failure of the temperance movement there on the population: &quot;The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt,&quot; and &quot;the grog shop is its center of power... The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced in a thousand localities.&quot;

Willard repeatedly denied Wells&#x27; accusations and wrote that &quot;the attitude of the society [WCTU] toward the barbarity of lynching has been more pronounced than that of any other association in the United States,&quot; and she maintained that her primary focus was upon empowering and protecting women, including the many African-American members of the WCTU. While it is true that neither Willard nor the WCTU had ever spoken out directly against lynching, the WCTU actively recruited black women and included them in its membership.

After their acrimonious exchange, Willard explicitly stated her opposition to lynching and successfully urged the WCTU to pass a resolution against lynching. She, however, continued to use the rhetoric that Wells alleged incited lynching. In her pamphlets &quot;Southern Horrors&quot; and &quot;The Red Record&quot;, Wells linked rhetoric portraying white women as symbols of innocence and purity that black men could not resist, as facilitating lynchings.

Wells also believed that Willard condoned segregation by permitting the practice within WCTU&#x27;s southern chapters. Under Willard&#x27;s presidency, the national WCTU maintained a policy of &quot;states rights&quot; which allowed southern charters to be more conservative than their northern counterparts regarding questions of race and the role of women in politics.

<doc id="294177" wikidata="Q161167" url="?curid=294177" title="Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll">
<text>Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll (Louisa Caroline Alberta; 18 March 1848 – 3 December 1939) was the sixth child and fourth daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

In her public life, she was a strong proponent of the arts and higher education and of the feminist cause. She was an influential supporter of the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science, the forerunner to Queen Margaret University, becoming the institution&#x27;s first Patron in 1891 until 1939. Her early life was spent moving among the various royal residences in the company of her family. When her father died in December 1861, the court went into a long period of mourning, to which with time Louise became unsympathetic. She was an able sculptor and artist, and several of her sculptures remain today. She was also a supporter of the feminist movement, corresponding with Josephine Butler, and visiting Elizabeth Garrett.

Before her marriage, Louise served as an unofficial secretary to the Queen from 1866 to 1871. The question of Louise&#x27;s marriage was discussed in the late 1860s. Suitors from the royal houses of Prussia and Denmark were suggested, but Victoria did not want her to marry a foreign prince, and therefore suggested a high-ranking member of the British aristocracy. Despite opposition from members of the royal family, Louise fell in love with John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, the heir of the Duke of Argyll. Victoria consented to the marriage, which took place on 21 March 1871. After a happy beginning, the two drifted apart, possibly because of their childlessness and the Queen&#x27;s constraints on their activities.

In 1878, Lorne was appointed Governor General of Canada, a post he held from 1878–1884. Louise was viceregal consort, starting a lasting interest in Canada. Her names were used to name many features in Canada, including Lake Louise and the province of Alberta. Following her mother&#x27;s death in 1901, she entered the social circle established by her elder brother, the new king, Edward VII. Louise&#x27;s marriage with Lorne survived thanks to long periods of separation; they reconciled in 1911, and Louise was devastated by Lorne&#x27;s death in 1914. After the First World War she began to retire from public life, undertaking few public duties outside Kensington Palace, where she died at the age of 91.

==Early life==
Louise was born on 18 March 1848 at Buckingham Palace, London. She was the fourth daughter and sixth child of the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria, and her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her birth coincided with revolutions which swept across Europe, prompting the queen to remark that Louise would turn out to be &quot;something peculiar&quot;.

Albert and Victoria chose the names &quot;Louisa Caroline Alberta&quot;. She was baptized on 13 May 1848 in Buckingham Palace&#x27;s private chapel by John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Though she was christened Louisa at the service, she was invariably known as Louise throughout her life. Her godparents were Duke Gustav Wilhelm of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom her great-aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy); and the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her first cousin once-removed, for whom the Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy). During the ceremony, the Duchess of Gloucester, one of the few children of King George III who were still alive, forgot where she was, and suddenly got up in the middle of the service and knelt at the queen&#x27;s feet, much to the queen&#x27;s horror.

Like her siblings, Louise was brought up with the strict programme of education devised by her father, Prince Albert, and his friend and confidant, Baron Stockmar. The young children were taught practical tasks, such as cooking, farming, household tasks and carpentry.

From her early years, Louise was a talented and intelligent child, and her artistic talents were quickly recognised. On his visit to Osborne House in 1863, Hallam Tennyson, the son of the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, remarked that Louise could &quot;draw beautifully&quot;. Because of her royal rank, an artistic career was not considered. However, the queen first allowed her to attend art school under the tutelage of the sculptor Mary Thornycroft, and later (1863) allowed her to study at the National Art Training School, now The Royal College of Art. Louise also became an able dancer, and Victoria wrote, after a dance, that Louise &quot;danced the sword dance with more verve and accuracy than any of her sisters&quot;. Her wit and intelligence made her a favourite with her father, with her inquisitive nature earning her the nickname &quot;Little Miss Why&quot; from other members of the royal family.

==Secretary==

Louise&#x27;s father, Prince Albert, died at Windsor on 14 December 1861. The queen was devastated, and ordered her household to move from Windsor to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The atmosphere of the royal court became gloomy and morbid in the wake of the prince&#x27;s death, and entertainments became dry and dull. Louise quickly became dissatisfied with her mother&#x27;s prolonged mourning. For her seventeenth birthday in 1865, Louise requested the ballroom to be opened for a debutante dance, the like of which had not been performed since Prince Albert&#x27;s death. Her request was refused, and her boredom with the mundane routine of travelling between the different royal residences at set times irritated her mother, who considered Louise to be indiscreet and argumentative.

The queen comforted herself by rigidly continuing with Prince Albert&#x27;s plans for their children. Princess Alice was married to Prince Louis, the future Grand Duke of Hesse, at Osborne House on 1 July 1862. In 1863, Edward, the Prince of Wales, married Princess Alexandra of Denmark. The queen made it a tradition that the eldest unmarried daughter become her unofficial secretary, a position which Louise filled in 1866 following the marriage of her elder sister Helena, despite the queen&#x27;s concern that she was indiscreet.

Louise, however, proved to be good at the job: Victoria wrote shortly afterwards: &quot;She is (and who would some years ago have thought it?) a clever dear girl with a fine strong character, unselfish and affectionate.&quot; However, when Louise fell in love with her brother Leopold&#x27;s tutor, the Reverend Robinson Duckworth (14 years her senior), between 1866 and 1870, the queen reacted by dismissing Duckworth in 1870. He later became Canon of Westminster Abbey.

Louise was bored at court, and by fulfilling her duties, which were little more than minor secretarial tasks, such as writing letters on the queen&#x27;s behalf; dealing with political correspondence; and providing the queen with company, she had more responsibilities. She also undertook her share of public and philanthropic duties, for example inaugurating the new North Eastern Hospital for Children in 1867 and launching the ship HMS &quot;Druid&quot; in 1869.

==Marriage==
===Suitors===
As a daughter of the queen, Louise was a desirable bride; more so as she is regarded as the queen&#x27;s most beautiful daughter by both contemporary and modern biographers. However, she was accused by the press, without substantiation, of romantic affairs. This, coupled with her liberalism and feminism, prompted the queen to find her a husband. The choice had to suit Victoria as well as Louise, and the queen insisted that her daughter&#x27;s husband should live near her, a promise which had also been extracted from the husband of Helena, Louise&#x27;s sister. Various suitors were proposed by the leading royal houses of Europe: Princess Alexandra proposed her brother, the Crown Prince of Denmark, but the queen was strongly opposed to another Danish marriage that could antagonise Prussia at a time of diplomatic tension over the Schleswig-Holstein question. Victoria, Louise&#x27;s eldest sister, proposed the tall and rich Prince Albert of Prussia, but Queen Victoria disapproved of another Prussian marriage that would have been unpopular in England. Prince Albert was also reluctant to settle in England as required. William, Prince of Orange, was also considered a suitor, but because of his extravagant lifestyle in Paris, where he lived openly with a lover, the queen quickly vetoed the idea.
Louise viewed marriage to any prince as undesirable, and announced that she wished to marry John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, heir to the Dukedom of Argyll. No marriage between a daughter of a monarch and a British subject had been given official recognition since 1515, when Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, married King Henry VIII&#x27;s sister Mary. Louise&#x27;s eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, was strongly opposed to a marriage with a non-mediatized noble. Furthermore, Lorne&#x27;s father, George Campbell, was an ardent supporter of William Ewart Gladstone, and the Prince of Wales was worried that he would drag the royal family into political disputes. Nevertheless, the opposition was crushed by the queen, who wrote to the Prince of Wales in 1869:

The queen averred that Louise&#x27;s marriage to a subject would bring &quot;new blood&quot; into the family, while all European princes were related to each other. She was convinced that this would strengthen the royal family morally and physically.

===Engagement and wedding===
Louise became engaged to the Marquess of Lorne on 3 October 1870 while they were visiting Balmoral. Lorne was invited to Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and accompanied Louise, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherley and Queen Victoria&#x27;s lady-in-waiting Lady Ely on a drive. Later that day, Louise returned and announced to the queen that Lorne had &quot;spoken of his devotion&quot; to Louise, and she accepted his proposal in the knowledge of the queen&#x27;s approval. The Queen later gave Lady Ely a bracelet to mark the occasion.

The Queen found it difficult to let go of her daughter, confiding in her journal that she &quot;felt painfully the thought of losing her&quot;. The new breach in royal tradition caused surprise, especially in Germany, and Queen Victoria wrote to the Queen of Prussia that princes of small impoverished German houses were &quot;very unpopular&quot; in Britain and that Lord Lorne, a &quot;person of distinction at home&quot; with &quot;an independent fortune&quot; was &quot;really no lower in rank than minor German Royalty&quot;.

Victoria settled an annuity on Louise shortly before her marriage. The ceremony was conducted at St George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle on 21 March 1871, and the crowd outside was so large that, for the first time, policemen had to form chain barriers to keep control. Louise wore a wedding veil of Honiton lace that she designed herself, and was escorted into the chapel by her mother, and her two eldest brothers, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh. On this occasion, the usually severe black of the queen&#x27;s mourning dress was relieved by the crimson rubies and blues of the Garter star. Following the ceremony, the queen kissed Louise, and Lorne – now a member of the royal family, but still a subject – kissed the queen&#x27;s hand.

The couple then journeyed to Claremont in Surrey for the honeymoon, but the presence of attendants on the journey, and at meal times, made it impossible for them to talk privately. The short four-day visit did not pass without an interruption from the queen, who was curious about her daughter&#x27;s thoughts on married life. Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria, now at Inveraray Castle.

Following her marriage, Louise continued her charitable and artistic interests. In 1871, the Ladies Work Society was founded in South Audley Street, promoting the making and sale of needlework and embroidery for poverty relief: Louise became its president, and designed some of their products.

The couple&#x27;s official place of residence was Rosneath House in Dumbartonshire.

==Viceregal consort of Canada==
In 1878, British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli nominated Lorne to be Canada&#x27;s Governor General, and he was duly appointed by Queen Victoria. Louise thus became his viceregal consort. 
As viceregal consort, she used her position to support the arts and higher education and the cause of female equality, although she said &quot;the subject of Domestic Economy lies at the root of the – highest life of every true woman.&quot; But her stay in Canada was unhappy as a result of homesickness, dislike of Ottawa and a bad sleighing accident.

===Inauspicious arrival===

On 15 November 1878, the couple left Liverpool and arrived in Canada for the inauguration at Halifax on 25 November.

Louise became the first royal to take up residence in Rideau Hall, officially the queen&#x27;s royal residence in Ottawa. However, the hall was far from the splendour of British royal residences, and, as each viceregal couple decorated the hall with their own furnishings, and thus took them when they departed, the Lornes found the palace sparse in décor upon their arrival. Louise put her artistic talents to work and hung many of her watercolour and oil paintings around the hall, also installing her sculpted works. Though the news that a daughter of the queen would be viceregal consort of Canada first saw a &quot;thrill of joy burst upon the Dominion&quot;, it being felt that the princess would be a strong link between Canadians and their sovereign, the arrival of the new governor general and his wife was not initially welcomed by the Canadian press, which complained about the imposition of royalty on the country&#x27;s hitherto un-regal society.

Relations with the press further deteriorated when Lorne&#x27;s private secretary, Francis de Winton, threw four journalists off the royal train. Although the Lornes had no knowledge of de Winton&#x27;s action, it was assumed by the press that they did, and they earned an early reputation for haughtiness. Louise was horrified by the negative press, and when she heard about reports of &quot;a nation of flunkies&quot; at the viceregal court, taking lessons in &quot;the backward walk,&quot; Louise declared that she &quot;wouldn&#x27;t care if they came in blanket coats!&quot; (A reference to the ubiquitous &quot;capote&quot;.) Eventually the worries of a rigid court at Rideau Hall and the &quot;feeble undercurrent of criticism&quot; turned out to be unfounded as the royal couple proved to be more relaxed than their predecessors.

===Canadian entertainments===

Louise&#x27;s first few months in Canada were tinged with sadness as her favourite sister Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine, died on 14 December 1878. Although homesick over that first Christmas, Louise soon grew accustomed to the winter climate. Sleighing and skating were two of her favourite pastimes. In Canada, as the monarch&#x27;s direct representative, Lorne always took precedence over his wife, so that at the Opening of the Parliament of Canada on 13 February 1879, Louise was ranked no differently from others in attendance. She had to remain standing with the MPs, until Lorne asked them to be seated. In order for Lorne to meet every Canadian member of Parliament, he held bi-weekly dinners for 50 people. However, some of the Canadian ladies responded negatively to the British party. One of her ladies-in-waiting reported that some had an I&#x27;m as good as you&#x27; sort of manner when one begins a conversation.&quot; Court entertainments were open; anyone who could afford the clothing to attend functions was simply asked to sign the visitor&#x27;s book. Louise&#x27;s first state ball was given on 19 February 1879, and she made a good impression on her guests when she ordered the silk cordon, separating the viceregal party from the guests, be removed. However, the ball was marred by various mishaps, including a drunken bandsman nearly starting a fire by pulling a curtain over a gas lamp. The open house practice was criticized by guests who complained about the low social status of other guests. One attendee was horrified to find the attendee&#x27;s grocer dancing in the same set.

One of her works as a sculptor is the statue of Queen Victoria, which now stands in front of the Royal Victoria College, Montreal, now the Strathcona Music Building of McGill University. Lorne&#x27;s father, The Duke of Argyll, arrived with two of his daughters in June, and in the presence of the family, Louise caught a salmon. The women&#x27;s success at fishing prompted the Duke to remark that fishing in Canada required no skill.

===Sleigh accident and Bermuda visit===

Louise, Lorne, and two attendants, were hurt in a sleigh accident on 14 February 1880. The winter was particularly severe, and the carriage in which they were traveling overturned, throwing the coachman and footman from the sleigh. The horses then panicked, and dragged the overturned carriage over more than of ground. Louise was knocked unconscious when she hit her head on the iron bar supporting the roof, and Lorne was trapped underneath her, expecting &quot;the sides of the carriage to give way at any moment&quot;. Eventually, as they overtook the sleigh ahead, the horses calmed, and the occupant of that sleigh, Princess Louise&#x27;s aide-de-camp, ordered an empty carriage to convey the injured party back to Rideau Hall.

The doctors who attended Louise reported she was severely concussed and in shock, and that &quot;it was a wonder her skull was not fractured&quot;. Louise&#x27;s ear had been injured when her earring caught on the side of the sleigh, tearing her ear lobe in two. The press played down the story on instructions from Lorne&#x27;s private secretary, an act that was described by contemporaries as &quot;stupid and ill advised&quot;. For example, one New Zealand newspaper reported, &quot;Excepting immediately after the blow, the princess was perfectly sensible during the whole time...&quot; Knowledge of Louise&#x27;s true condition might have elicited sympathy from the Canadian people. As it was, one Member of Parliament wrote: &quot;Except the cut in the lower part of the ear I think there was no injury done worth mentioning.&quot; Therefore, when Louise cancelled her immediate engagements, people thought she was malingering. News of the accident was also played down in Britain and in letters home to the anxious Queen Victoria. Princess Louise left Canada for England in 1881 while her husband remained in Canada until 1883.

She played a major role in the development of the nascent tourism industry of the colony of Bermuda, south-east of Nova Scotia. In 1883, because of her fragile health, she spent the winter in Bermuda (arriving on 29 January 1883 from Charleston, South Carolina, aboard , popularising a trend for wealthy North Americans to escape to Bermuda&#x27;s relatively mild climate during the winter months. Her visit brought such attention to Bermuda that a palatial hotel, which opened in 1885, intended to cater to these new visitors, was named after her; the Princess Hotel was built on the shore of Hamilton Harbour, in the parish of Pembroke (the Princess herself having occupied &quot;Inglewood&quot;, the home of JH Timingham, in Paget Parish, during her visit).

===Continued interest in Canada===
After returning to Britain in 1883, Louise continued to take an interest in Canada. During the North-West Rebellion of 1885 she sent a certain Dr. Boyd medical supplies and a large fund of money for distribution. Her express instructions were that assistance was to be rendered to friend and foe indiscriminately. To fulfill her wishes, Boyd accompanied the Militia Medical Staff under Dr. Thomas Roddick to the sites of the Battle of Fish Creek and the Battle of Batoche to help give medical treatment to the wounded, including the Métis opposition.

In 1905, the province of Alberta was named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta. Within the province, Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in her honour.

==Queen Victoria&#x27;s last years==
===Family conflict===

Louise returned to Britain with her husband on 27 October 1883. Queen Victoria had allocated them apartments at Kensington Palace, and the couple took up official residence in the suite that was to remain Louise&#x27;s home for the rest of her life.

Louise resumed public duties in Britain, for example, opening St George&#x27;s Gardens, Bloomsbury on 1 July 1884, and Lorne his political career, campaigning unsuccessfully for the Hampstead seat in 1885. In 1895, he won the South Manchester seat, entering parliament as a Liberal. Louise, unlike Lorne and his father, was in favour of Irish Home Rule, and disappointed when he defected from Gladstonian Liberalism to the Liberal Unionists. Relations between Louise and Lorne were strained, and, despite the queen&#x27;s attempts to keep them under one roof, they often went their separate ways. Even when he accompanied Louise, he was not always received with favour at court, and the Prince of Wales did not take to him. Out of all the royal family, Lorne was the only one to be identified closely with a political party, having been a Gladstonian liberal in the House of Commons.

Louise&#x27;s relationship with the two sisters closest to the queen, Beatrice and Helena, was strained at best. Beatrice had married the tall and handsome Prince Henry of Battenberg in a love match in 1885, and they had four children. Louise, who had a jealous nature, had grown accustomed to treating Beatrice with pity on account of the queen&#x27;s constant need for her. Beatrice&#x27;s biographer, Matthew Dennison, claims that in contrast to Beatrice, Louise remained strikingly good looking throughout her forties. Louise and her husband were no longer close, and rumours spread about Lorne&#x27;s alleged homosexuality. Thus, Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual relationship with her popular husband, which Louise was not. Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself. Certainly, following Prince Henry&#x27;s death in 1896, Louise wrote that: &quot;he [Henry] was almost the greatest friend I had—I, too, miss him more than I can say&quot;. In addition, Louise attempted to champion her late brother-in-law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice, a mere cipher, meant nothing to him.

===Rumours regarding Louise===
From late 1865 to mid 1866, the royal family was guarded by 150 Scots Fusiliers. Officially, this was to protect the family from Fenian threats, but it was whispered by members of high society that Louise had fallen pregnant by Walter Stirling, the tutor of her brother Leopold. According to Louise&#x27;s biographer, Lucinda Hawksley, her son Henry was born in 1866 and shortly after the Queen&#x27;s lawyers were summoned to her residence. The Queen&#x27;s obstetrician Frederick Locock and his wife adopted a son named Henry, immediately after the meeting. The boy supposedly grew up with other royal children and claimed to have been Louise&#x27;s child. DNA testing has been sanctioned by Henry&#x27;s descendants, but courts ruled the claims unfounded.

Further rumours spread that Louise was having an affair with Arthur Bigge, later Lord Stamfordham, the queen&#x27;s assistant private secretary. Beatrice mentioned the rumours to the queen&#x27;s physician, calling it a &quot;scandal&quot;, and Prince Henry claimed to have seen Bigge drinking Louise&#x27;s health at dinner. Louise denied the rumour, claiming that it was started by Beatrice and Helena to undermine her position at court. However, on Henry&#x27;s death, relations between the sisters sporadically improved, and it was Louise, rather than the queen, who was the first to arrive at Cimiez to be with the widowed Beatrice. Nevertheless, Louise&#x27;s jealousy did not evaporate completely. James Reid, the queen&#x27;s physician, wrote to his wife a few years later: &quot;Louise is as usual much down on her sisters. Hope she won&#x27;t stay long or she will do mischief!&quot;

Rumours of affairs did not concern only Bigge. In 1890, the sculptor Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm died in Louise&#x27;s presence at his studio in London, leading to rumours that the two were having an affair. According to historian Lucinda Hawksley, the two had a long-lasting love affair. Boehm&#x27;s assistant, Alfred Gilbert, who played a central role in comforting Louise after Boehm&#x27;s death, and supervised the destruction of Boehm&#x27;s private papers, was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor. Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. However, Jehanne Wake, Louise&#x27;s biographer, argues that there is no substantial evidence to suggest that Louise had sexual relationships with anyone other than her husband.

During Victoria&#x27;s last years, Louise carried out a range of public duties, such as opening public buildings, laying foundation stones, and officiating at special programmes. Louise, like her eldest sister Victoria, was more liberally minded, and supported the suffragist movement, completely contrary to the queen&#x27;s views. Louise privately visited Elizabeth Garrett, the first British woman openly to qualify as a physician. Queen Victoria deplored the idea of women joining professions, especially medicine, and described the training of female physicians as a &quot;repulsive subject&quot;.

===Louise as unconventional royal===

Louise was determined to be seen as an ordinary person and not as a member of the court. When travelling abroad, she often used the alias &quot;Mrs Campbell&quot;. Louise was known for her charity towards servants. On one occasion, the butler approached her and requested permission to dismiss the second footman, who was late getting out of bed. When she advised that the footman be given an alarm clock, the butler informed her that he already had one. She then went so far as to suggest a bed that would throw him out at a specified time, but she was told this was not feasible. Finally, she suggested that he might be ill, and when checked, he was found to have tuberculosis. The footman was therefore sent to New Zealand to recover.

On another occasion, when she visited Bermuda, she was invited to a reception and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a Black woman named Mrs McCarthy for a glass of water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: &quot;Well take a good look at me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges.&quot; The princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.

Louise and her sisters had another disagreement after the death of the queen&#x27;s close friend, Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill. Determined not to put her mother through more misery, Louise wanted the news to be broken to the queen gradually. When this was not done, Louise voiced sharp criticism of Helena and Beatrice. One month later, on 22 January 1901, Queen Victoria died at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. In her will, the queen bequeathed Kent House, on the Osborne Estate, to Louise as a country residence, and gave Osborne Cottage to Louise&#x27;s youngest sister, Beatrice. Louise and Beatrice were now neighbours both at Kensington Palace and Osborne.

==Later life==
===Edwardian period===

Upon Queen Victoria&#x27;s death, Louise entered the social circle of her brother, the new King Edward VII, with whom she had much in common, including smoking. She had an obsession with physical fitness, and if she was sneered at for this, she would retort by saying: &quot;Never mind, I&#x27;ll outlive you all.&quot; Meanwhile, Louise&#x27;s husband, 9th Duke of Argyll since 1900, took his seat in the House of Lords. The Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, offered him the office of Governor-General of Australia that year, but the offer was declined. Louise continued her sculpture, and in 1902, designed a memorial to the colonial soldiers who died in the Boer War. In the same year, she began a nude study of a married woman suggested by the English painter Sir William Blake Richmond.

Louise spent much of her time at Kent House, and she frequently visited Scotland with her husband. Financial pressures did not disappear when Lorne became Duke, and Louise avoided inviting the King to Inveraray, Argyll&#x27;s ancestral home, because the couple were economising. When Queen Victoria had visited the house before Lorne became Duke of Argyll, there were seventy servants and seventy-four dogs. By the time of Edward VII&#x27;s accession, there were four servants and two dogs.

The Duke of Argyll&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate. He became increasingly senile, and Louise nursed him devotedly from 1911. In these years Louise and her husband were closer than they had been before. In spring 1914 Louise stayed at Kensington Palace while her husband remained on the Isle of Wight. He developed bronchial problems followed by double pneumonia. Louise was summoned on 28 April 1914, and he died on 2 May. Following his death, Louise had a nervous breakdown and suffered from intense loneliness, writing to a friend shortly afterwards: &quot;My loneliness without the Duke is quite terrible. I wonder what he does now!&quot;

===Last years===
Louise spent her last years at Kensington Palace, occupying rooms next to her sister Princess Beatrice. She made occasional public appearances with the royal family, such as at the Cenotaph at Whitehall on 11 November 1925. In 1926, she laid the foundation stone of the Princess Louise Hospital for Children in Kensington.

In 1935, she greeted her nephew, King George V, and his wife, Queen Mary, at Kensington Town Hall during their Silver Jubilee celebrations, and was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Kensington. Her last public appearance occurred in 1937, at the Home Arts and Industries Exhibition. Between these occasions, her great nephew, King Edward VIII, abdicated on 11 December 1936. In December 1936, Louise wrote to the British prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, sympathising with him about the crisis.

However, her health deteriorated. Following the accession of Edward&#x27;s brother King George VI, she became too ill to move around, and was confined to Kensington Palace, affectionately called the &quot;Auntie Palace&quot; by Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. She developed neuritis in her arm, inflammation of the nerves between the ribs, fainting fits, and sciatica. Louise occupied herself by drafting prayers, one of which was sent to Neville Chamberlain, reading &quot;Guide our Ministers of State and all who are in authority over us ... &quot;

==Death==

Princess Louise died at Kensington Palace on the morning of 3 December 1939 at the age of 91, wearing the wedding veil she had worn almost 70 years earlier. Following a simple funeral, owing to the war, her remains were cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 8 December 1939. Her ashes were quietly placed in the Royal Vault at St. George&#x27;s Chapel on 12 December 1939, with many members of the British royal family and Argyll family present. Her ashes were moved to the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore near Windsor, on 13 March 1940. Louise&#x27;s will stated that if she died in Scotland she should be buried at the Campbell mausoleum in Kilmun next to her husband; if in England, at Frogmore near her parents. Her coffin was borne by eight NCOs of her own regiment, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Her estate was probated as £239,260, 18 shillings and sixpence, with her debts including 15 shillings for cigarettes.

==Legacy==
Louise bestowed her name on four Canadian regiments: The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise&#x27;s) in Hamilton, Ontario; the Princess Louise Dragoon Guards in Ottawa, Ontario (later the 4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards – inactive since 1965); the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise&#x27;s) in Moncton, New Brunswick; and the Princess Louise Fusiliers in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Queen Elizabeth II later recalled that Louise and her sister Beatrice would talk until they stunned their audience with their output of words.

The province of Alberta in Canada is named after her. Although the name &quot;Louise&quot; was originally planned, the princess wished to honour her dead father, so the last of her given names was chosen. Lake Louise in Alberta is also named after her, as is Mount Alberta. Although her time in Canada was not always happy, she liked the Canadian people and retained close links with her Canadian regiments. Back at home, she gained a reputation for paying unscheduled visits to hospitals, especially during her later years. Her relationship with her family was generally close. Although at times she bickered with the queen, and her sisters Helena and Beatrice, the relations did not remain strained for long. She retained a lifelong correspondence with her brother Arthur and was one of King Edward VII&#x27;s favourite sisters. Of all her siblings, she was closest to Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, and Princess Alice, and she was devastated by their deaths in 1884 and 1878 respectively.

Among the younger generations of the family, Louise&#x27;s favourite relatives were the Duke and Duchess of Kent, her grandnephew and his wife. At the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937, Louise lent the Duchess the train that she designed and wore for the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1902.

=== Art practice ===
Louise had artistic training from childhood, first with Susan Durant from 1864, then Mary Thornycroft from 1867, and further lessons with Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm. She also then attended National Art Training School. Like many women artists in the nineteenth century, Louise had to make do with training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists. There was no training from the nude model, as there was for male art students.

Louise was the most artistically talented of Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughters and was a prolific artist and sculptor. When Louise sculpted a statue of the queen, portraying her in Coronation robes, the press claimed that her tutor, Sir Edgar Boehm, was the true creator of the work. The claim was denied by Louise&#x27;s friends, who asserted her effort and independence. The work was intended to be exhibited in 1887, but production was delayed until 1893. A memorial to her brother-in-law, Prince Henry of Battenberg, and a memorial to the colonial soldiers who fell during the Second Boer War, reside at Whippingham Church on the Isle of Wight, and another statue of Queen Victoria remains at McGill University in Montreal, as well as the statue of Queen Victoria on the north side of Lichfield Cathedral.

<doc id="294178" wikidata="Q362742" url="?curid=294178" title="Robert J. Sawyer">
<text>Robert James Sawyer (born April 29, 1960) is a Canadian and American science fiction writer. He has had 25 novels published and his short fiction has appeared in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, &quot;On Spec&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot;, and numerous anthologies. He has won many writing awards, including the best-novel Nebula Award (1995), the best-novel Hugo Award (2003), the John W. Campbell Memorial Award (2006), the Robert A. Heinlein Award (2017), and more Aurora Awards than anyone else in history.

Sawyer was born in Ottawa. He has lived in the Greater Toronto Area for most of his life and has been a resident of Mississauga since 2000.

== Fiction ==

=== Style and themes ===
Sawyer&#x27;s work frequently explores the intersection between science and religion, with rationalism winning out over mysticism (see especially &quot;Far-Seer&quot;, &quot;The Terminal Experiment&quot;, &quot;Calculating God&quot;, and the three volumes of the &quot;Neanderthal Parallax&quot; (&quot;Hominids&quot;, &quot;Humans&quot;, and &quot;Hybrids&quot;), plus the short story &quot;The Abdication of Pope Mary III&quot;, originally published in &quot;Nature&quot;, July 6, 2000).

Sawyer often explores the notion of copied or uploaded human consciousness, mind uploading (most fully in his novel &quot;Mindscan&quot;), but also in &quot;Flashforward&quot;, &quot;Golden Fleece&quot;, &quot;The Terminal Experiment&quot;, &quot;Identity Theft&quot;, &quot;Biding Time&quot;, &quot;Shed Skin&quot;, and &quot;The Downloaded&quot;.

His interest in consciousness studies is also apparent in &quot;Wake&quot;, which deals with the spontaneous emergence of consciousness in the infrastructure of the World Wide Web. His interest in quantum physics, and especially quantum computing, inform the short stories &quot;You See But You Do Not Observe&quot; (a Sherlock Holmes pastiche) and &quot;Iterations,&quot; and the novels &quot;Factoring Humanity&quot; and &quot;Hominids&quot;.

SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, plays a role in the plots of &quot;Golden Fleece&quot;, &quot;Factoring Humanity&quot;, &quot;Mindscan&quot;, &quot;Rollback&quot;, the novelette &quot;Ineluctable,&quot; and the short stories &quot;You See But You Do Not Observe&quot; and &quot;Flashes.&quot; Sawyer gives cosmology a thorough discussion in his far-future &quot;Starplex&quot;. Real-life science institutions are often used as settings by Sawyer, including TRIUMF in &quot;End of an Era&quot;, CERN in &quot;Flashforward&quot;, the Royal Ontario Museum in &quot;Calculating God&quot;, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in &quot;Hominids&quot; and its sequels, the Arecibo Observatory in &quot;Rollback&quot;, the Canadian Light Source in &quot;Quantum Night&quot;, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Institute for Advanced Study in &quot;The Oppenheimer Alternative&quot;.

Sawyer&#x27;s prose has been described by Orson Scott Card as near Isaac Asimovian in its clarity.

==== SF/mystery crossovers ====
Sawyer has won both Canada&#x27;s top SF award (the Prix Aurora Award) and its top mystery-fiction award (the Arthur Ellis Award) for his 1993 short story &quot;Just Like Old Times&quot;. &quot;Illegal Alien&quot; is a courtroom drama with an extraterrestrial defendant; &quot;Hominids&quot; puts one Neanderthal on trial by his peers for the apparent murder of another Neanderthal; &quot;Mindscan&quot; has the rights of uploaded consciousnesses explored in a Michigan probate court; and &quot;Golden Fleece&quot;, &quot;Fossil Hunter&quot;, &quot;The Terminal Experiment&quot;, &quot;Frameshift&quot;, &quot;Flashforward&quot;, and &quot;Red Planet Blues&quot; are all, in part, murder mysteries. Of Sawyer&#x27;s shorter SF works, the novella &quot;Identity Theft&quot; and the short stories &quot;Biding Time&quot;, &quot;Flashes&quot;, &quot;Iterations&quot;, &quot;Shed Skin&quot;, &quot;The Stanley Cup Caper&quot;, &quot;You See But You Do Not Observe&quot;, &quot;The Hand You&#x27;re Dealt&quot;, and the aforementioned &quot;Just Like Old Times&quot; are all also crime or mystery fiction.

== Editing and scholarly work ==
In addition to his own writing, Sawyer used to edit the Robert J. Sawyer Books science-fiction imprint for Red Deer Press, part of Canadian publisher Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside; contributes to &quot;The New York Review of Science Fiction&quot;; is &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;″s authority on science fiction; and is a judge for L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s Writers of the Future contest.

Sawyer continues to use WordStar 7.0 for DOS (the final release, last updated in 1992) to write his novels. All twenty-five of his novels were written with WordStar. He runs WordStar on modern systems using the DOSBox-X emulator. Sawyer shared the &quot;Complete WordStar 7.0 Archive&quot; on his website.

== Film and television ==

In May 2009, ABC ordered 13 episodes of &quot;FlashForward&quot; (an hour-long dramatic TV series) for the 2009–2010 season. It is based on Sawyer&#x27;s similarly titled novel, after successful production in February and March 2009 of a pilot episode scripted by David S. Goyer and Brannon Braga, directed by Goyer, and starring Joseph Fiennes and Sonya Walger. After some adjustments, the first season was set to consist of 22 episodes. Sawyer was a consultant on each episode of the series and wrote the 19th episode, entitled &quot;Course Correction&quot;.

Sawyer wrote the original series bible for &quot;Charlie Jade&quot;, an hour-long science-fiction TV series that first aired in 2005–2006, and he did conceptual work in 2003 for reviving &quot;Robotech&quot;. He has also written and narrated documentaries about science fiction for CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Ideas&quot; series, and he hosted the 17-part weekly half-hour documentary series &quot;Supernatural Investigator&quot; for Canada&#x27;s Vision TV, which premiered January 27, 2009. He provided analysis of the British science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for the CBC&#x27;s online documentary &quot;The Planet of the Doctor&quot;, frequently comments on science fiction movies for TVOntario&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;, and co-edited an essay collection in honor of the fortieth anniversary of &quot;Star Trek&quot; with David Gerrold, titled &quot;Boarding the Enterprise&quot;.

== Teaching and public speaking ==

Sawyer has taught science-fiction writing at the University of Toronto, Ryerson University, Humber College, and the Banff Centre. In 2000, he served as Writer-in-Residence at the Richmond Hill, Ontario public library. In 2003, he was Writer-in-Residence at the Toronto Public Library&#x27;s Merril Collection of Science Fiction, Speculation and Fantasy (the first person to hold this post since Judith Merril herself in 1987). In 2006, he was Writer-in-Residence at the Odyssey Writing Workshop. Also in 2006, he was the Edna Staebler Writer-in-Residence at the Kitchener public library in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, following the Region of Waterloo&#x27;s choice of Sawyer&#x27;s &quot;Hominids&quot; as the &quot;One Book, One Community&quot; title that all 490,000 residents were encouraged to read in 2005. In 2007 he was the Berton House Writer-in-Residence at Berton House in Dawson City. In 2009, he was the first-ever Writer-in-Residence at the Canadian Light Source, Canada&#x27;s national synchrotron facility in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

Sawyer is a frequent keynote speaker about technology topics, and has served as a consultant to Canada&#x27;s Federal Department of Justice on the shape that future genetics laws should take.

== Influence and recognition ==
=== Canadian ===
Sawyer has long been an advocate of Canadian science fiction. He lobbied hard for the creation of the Canadian Region of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America
. The Canadian Region was established in 1992, and Sawyer served for three years on SFWA&#x27;s Board of Directors as the first Canadian Regional Director (1992–1995). He also edited the newsletter of the Canadian Region, called &quot;Alouette&quot; in honor of Canada&#x27;s first satellite; the newsletter was nominated for a Prix Aurora Award for best fanzine.

Sawyer was awarded an 
Honorary Doctor of Letters from Laurentian University in 2007 and an 
Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Winnipeg in 2014.

=== International translations ===

In addition to his popularity at home, Sawyer&#x27;s work is well received internationally. All of his novels have been issued by New York publishing houses and translated editions have appeared in Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, Hungarian, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, and Spanish.

=== Professional associations ===
In 1998, Sawyer was elected president of SFWA on a platform that promised a referendum on various contentious issues, including periodic membership requalification and the creation of a Nebula Award for best script; he won, defeating the next-closest candidate, past-SFWA-president Norman Spinrad, by a 3:2 margin. However, Sawyer&#x27;s actual time in office was marked by considerable opposition to membership requalification and negative reaction to his dismissing, with the majority support of the Board of Directors, one paid SFWA worker and one volunteer. He resigned after completing half of his one-year term, and was automatically succeeded by then-incumbent vice-president Paul Levinson. Prior to resigning, Sawyer&#x27;s promised referendum was held, resulting in significant changes to SFWA&#x27;s bylaws and procedures, most notably allowing appropriate non-North American sales to count as membership credentials, allowing appropriate electronic sales to count as membership credentials, and creating a Nebula Award for best script.

Sawyer has been active in other writers&#x27; organizations, including the Crime Writers of Canada, the Horror Writers Association, and the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada (for which he has served on the membership committee), and he is a member of scriptwriting unions Writers Guild of America and Writers Guild of Canada.

<text>Barnstaple ( or ) is a river-port town and civil parish in the North Devon district of Devon, England. The town lies at the River Taw&#x27;s lowest crossing point before the Bristol Channel. From the 14th century, it was licensed to export wool from which it earned great wealth. Later it imported Irish wool, but its harbour silted up and other trades developed such as shipbuilding, foundries and sawmills. A Victorian market building survives, with a high glass and timber roof on iron columns.

==Toponymy==
The name is first recorded in the 10th century and is thought to derive from the Early English &quot;bearde&quot;, meaning &quot;battle-axe&quot;, and &quot;stapol&quot;, meaning &quot;pillar&quot;, i.e. a post or pillar to mark a religious or administrative meeting place. The derivation from &quot;staple&quot; meaning &quot;market&quot;, indicating a market from its foundation, is likely to be incorrect, as the use of &quot;staple&quot; in that sense first appears in 1423.

Barnstaple was formerly referred to as &quot;Barum&quot;, as a contraction of the Latin form of the name &quot;ad Barnastapolitum&quot; in Latin documents such as the episcopal registers of the Diocese of Exeter. The spelling Barnstable was also used for the town but is now obsolete, although that spelling is retained in America by a town in Massachusetts and its county, which were named after Barnstaple.

Barum is a historical name, which was revived in the Victorian era in several novels. It remains in the names of a football team, a brewery and several businesses, and on numerous milestones. The former Brannam Pottery in Litchdon Street was known for its trademark &quot;Barum&quot; etched on the base of its products.

==History==

The earliest local settlement was probably at Pilton by the River Yeo, now a northern suburb. Pilton is recorded in the Burghal Hidage (c. 917) as a burh founded by Alfred the Great, and may have undergone a Viking attack in 893, but by the later 10th-century Barnstaple had taken over its local defence. It had a mint before the Norman Conquest.

The feudal barony of Barnstaple had its caput at Barnstaple Castle, granted by William the Conqueror to Geoffrey de Montbray, who appears as its holder in the 1086 Domesday Book. The barony fell to the Crown in 1095 after Montbray rebelled against William II. He transferred the barony to Juhel de Totnes, a feudal baron of Totnes. By 1107 Juhel had founded Totnes Priory and then Barnstaple Priory, of the Cluniac order, dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. After Juhel&#x27;s son died intestate, the barony was split between the de Braose and Tracy families, before reuniting under Henry de Tracy. It then passed through several families, before ending in the hands of Margaret Beaufort (died 1509), mother of King Henry VII.

A market is first recorded in 1274. The town&#x27;s wealth in the Middle Ages rested on being a staple port licensed to export wool. It had an early merchant guild of St Nicholas. In the early 14th century it was Devon&#x27;s third richest town after Exeter and Plymouth, and its largest textile centre outside Exeter until about 1600. The wool trade was aided by its port, from which five ships were contributed to a force sent to fight the Spanish Armada in 1588. Barnstaple was one of the &quot;privileged ports&quot; of the Spanish Company, (established 1577), whose armorials appear on two mural monuments to 17th-century merchants: Richard Beaple (died 1643), three times Mayor, and Richard Ferris (Mayor in 1632), who with Alexander Horwood received a payment from the Corporation of Barnstaple in 1630 for &quot;riding to Exeter about the Spanish Company.&quot; in St Peter&#x27;s Church, and on the decorated plaster ceiling of the old &quot;Golden Lion Inn&quot;, Boutport Street, now a restaurant beside the Royal and Fortescue Hotel.
The town benefited from rising trade with America in the 16th and 17th centuries, for the benefit of wealthy merchants who built impressive town houses. Some of these survive behind more recent frontages, for instance No. 62 Boutport Street, said to have one of the best plaster ceilings in Devon. The merchants also built almshouses, including Penrose&#x27;s, and backed their legacy with elaborate family monuments inside the church.

By the 18th century, Barnstaple had ceased to be a woollen manufacturing town. Its output was replaced from Ireland, for which it was the main landing place; the raw materials were then taken by land to clothmaking towns in mid and east-Devon, such as Tiverton and Honiton. However, the harbour was silting up. As early as c. 1630 Tristram Risdon reported, &quot;It hardly beareth small vessels.&quot; Bideford, lower down the estuary and benefiting from the scouring by the fast-flowing River Torridge, gradually took over the trade.

Although Barnstaple&#x27;s trade in 1680–1730 was surpassed by Bideford&#x27;s, it retained economic importance into the early 20th century, manufacturing lace, gloves, sail-cloth and fishing-nets, with extensive potteries, tanneries, sawmills and foundries, and some shipbuilding still carried on. The Bear Street drill hall dates from the early 19th century.

Between the 1930s and the 1950s the urban area grew to incorporate the villages of Pilton, Newport, and Roundswell through ribbon development.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering Barnstaple, at parish (town), district and county level: Barnstaple Town Council, North Devon Council (based just outside Barnstaple) and Devon County Council (based in Exeter). Barnstaple Town Council meets at the Guildhall on High Street and has its offices at Barum House on The Square.

===Administrative history===
Barnstaple was an ancient borough. Its early status as a borough was ambiguous; in 1340 the town&#x27;s guild claimed it had been incorporated in 930 by King Athelstan in a charter which had since been lost. The town was described as a borough in the Domesday Book of 1086, and from at least 1210 the town was being run by a guild which appointed a mayor. The claim in 1340 was made as part of a petition to Edward III seeking a new charter with additional powers. This was resisted by the lord of the feudal barony of Barnstaple. Following an inquisition ad quod damnum it was ruled that the town was in fact a lower status mesne borough answerable to the lord, rather than a free borough responsible directly to the monarch. The mayor was therefore not recognised as such by the monarch, but was deemed to be merely a bailiff of the lord. The guild made several other unsuccessful attempts to secure a charter from the king throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, including seeking confirmation of rights supposedly conferred by charters from Henry II and subsequent monarchs, but those charters were forgeries, copied from Exeter&#x27;s charters.

The town eventually secured a charter of incorporation from Mary I in 1557. The council built the Guildhall on High Street in 1828 to serve as its meeting place. It was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836, governed by a corporate body officially called the &quot;mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Barnstaple&quot;, but generally known as the corporation or town council. The borough boundaries, which had previously been identical to the parish of Barnstaple, were enlarged at the same time to include part of the parish of Pilton (including the village itself) and the Newport area from the parish of Bishop&#x27;s Tawton. The borough was further enlarged in 1899 to take in the Rolle&#x27;s Quay area from Pilton and an area on the west bank of the River Taw (including Barnstaple Junction railway station) which had previously been in the parish of Tawstock.

The town council moved its offices to Castle House in the grounds of the castle in 1927, which in turn was replaced by a new Civic Centre on North Walk in 1969. The borough of Barnstaple was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area merging with Barnstaple Rural District, South Molton Rural District and the urban districts of Ilfracombe and Lynton to become the new district of North Devon. A successor parish was created covering the area of the former borough, with its council taking the name Barnstaple Town Council. The Civic Centre passed to North Devon Council, whilst the town council was initially based at the Guildhall. In 1993 the town council acquired Barum House on The Square to serve as its offices, but continues to use the Guildhall for meetings.

===Parliamentary status===
From 1295 the Borough of Barnstaple had two members in the House of Commons until 1885, when this was reduced to one. The constituency was replaced for the 1950 general election by the large modern constituency of North Devon, held by Nick Harvey MP of the Liberal Democrats from 1992 until 2015, when Peter Heaton-Jones of the Conservative Party was elected and re-elected in 2017. Between 2019 and 2024 the MP was the Conservative Selaine Saxby. Since 2024 the MP has been the Liberal Democrat Ian Roome.

==Geography==

Barnstaple is the largest town in North Devon. It lies west-south-west of Bristol, north of Plymouth and north-west of the county town and city of Exeter. It was founded at the lowest crossing point of the River Taw, where its estuary starts to widen, about 7 miles (11 km) inland from Barnstaple Bay in the Bristol Channel. On the north side, the Taw is joined by the River Yeo, which rises on Berry Down near Combe Martin.

Most of the town lies on the east bank of the estuary, connected to the west by the ancient Barnstaple Long Bridge, with 16 arches. The town&#x27;s early medieval layout still appears from the street plan and street names, with Boutport Street (&quot;About the Port&quot;) following the curved line of a ditch outside the town walls. The area of medieval shipbuilding and repair is still called The Strand, an early word for shore.

===Climate===
Barnstaple has cool wet winters and mild wet summers. Mean high temperatures range from 9 C (48 F) in January to 21 C (70 F) in July. The record high is 34 C (94 F) and the record low −9 C (16 F). October is the wettest month with 103 mm (4.1 in) of rain. The mean annual rainfall is 862 mm (33.9 in), with rain on 138 days.

==Demography==
Barnstaple parish population in the 1801 census was 3,748, in 1901 9,698, and in 2001 22,497.

In 2011 the racial make-up was:
*White British 77.9%

As a major town, Barnstaple has a similar ethnic make-up to other south-west towns such as Truro and Cullompton. It is more diverse than the North Devon district (95.9% White British) and Devon as a whole (94.2% White British).

==Economy==

North Devon is some distance from Britain&#x27;s traditional areas of industrial activity and population. In the late 1970s it gained several industrial firms due to the availability of central government grants for opening factories and operating them on low or zero levels of local taxation. This was scarcely successful, with few lasting beyond the few years that grants were available. One success was the manufacturing of generic medicines by Cox Pharmaceuticals (now branded Allergan), which moved in 1980 from a site in Brighton, Sussex. A lasting effect on the town has been the development and expansion of industrial estates at Seven Brethren, Whiddon Valley and Pottington.

Whilst the 1989 opening of the improved A361 connection to the motorway network assisted trade in ways such as weekend tourism, it was detrimental to some distribution businesses. These had previously seen the town as a base for local distribution, a need removed when travelling time to the M5 motorway was roughly halved.

With Barnstaple as the main shopping area for North Devon, retail work contributes to the economy. There are chain stores in the town centre and in the Roundswell Business Park, on the western fringe of the town. Multi-million pound redevelopment round the former &quot;Leaderflush Shapland&quot; works at Anchorwood Bank is creating a conservation area near the River Taw, hundreds of new homes, a retail area of shops, restaurants and leisure facilities.

By far the largest employer in the region is local and central government, particularly the Royal Marines Base Chivenor, west of the town, and North Devon District Hospital, to the north.

In 2005 unemployment in North Devon was 1.8–2.4 per cent, while median per capita wage for North Devon was 73 per cent of the UK national average. The level of work in the informal or casual sector is high, partly during seasonal tourism. By 2018 unemployment in North Devon had fallen from a 2010 high to 1.2 per cent, while median weekly full-time pay stood at £440 per week and average housing prices at £230,000. The number of businesses registered has risen by 370 since 2010 to 4,895. The year 2018 also saw government investment through Coastal Community grants and Housing Infrastructure funds £83 million to upgrade the North Devon Link Road.

==Landmarks==

Barnstaple has an eclectic mix of architectural styles, with the 19th century predominant, despite remnants of early buildings and several early plaster ceilings. St Anne&#x27;s Chapel in the central churchyard can be seen as the most important ancient building to survive. Queen Anne&#x27;s Walk was erected in about 1708 as a mercantile exchange. The Georgian Guildhall is also of interest, as is the Pannier Market beneath it. The museum has an &quot;arts and crafts&quot; appearance with tessellated floors and locally made staircase and decorative fireplaces.

===Barnstaple Castle===
Barnstaple Castle, founded in the 11th or 12th century and first mentioned the 12th century, may derive from Juhel (Joel) of Totnes in the early 12th century. King Stephen granted the castle to Henry de Tracy, a supporter of his. In the 12th century, stone buildings were built over the motte, possibly during Henry de Tracy&#x27;s tenure. The castle descended through his family to another Henry de Tracy, who held the castle in 1228 when Henry III ordered the Sheriff of Devon to make sure its walls did not exceed in height. By the death of the last Henry de Tracey in 1274, the castle had begun to decay. An inquisition of 1281 found that building materials had been removed from the castle without permission; by 1326 it was a ruin. Part of the castle walls blew down in a storm in 1601.

The Neo-Gothic Manor of Tawstock, originally Tawstock House, is two miles south of Barnstaple. It replaced an earlier Tudor mansion, built in 1574 but lost to a fire in 1787.

===St Anne&#x27;s Chapel===
The Grade II listed St Anne&#x27;s Chapel was restored in 2012 and is used as a community centre that can accommodate 60 people. It was an ancient Gothic chantry chapel, whose assets were acquired by the Mayor of Barnstaple and others in 1585, some time after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. A deed of feoffment dated 1 November 1585 exists in the George Grant Francis collection in Cardiff.

===Pannier Market and Butchers&#x27; Row===
Barnstaple has been the major market for North Devon since Saxon times. Demands for health regulation of its Victorian food market saw the construction in 1855–1856 of a Pannier Market, originally known as the Vegetable Market and designed by local architect R. D. Gould. This has a high glass-and-timber roof on iron columns. At long, it runs the length of Butchers&#x27; Row. Market days are Monday – Crafts and General (April to December), Tuesday – General and Produce, Wednesday – Arts Collectables and Books, Thursday – Crafts and General, Friday – General and Produce, and Saturday – General and Produce.

Built on the far side of the street at the same time as the Pannier Market, Butchers&#x27; Row has ten shops with pilasters of Bath Stone and wrought-iron supports for an overhanging roof. Only one is still a butcher&#x27;s, although successor shops still sell local farm goods. There is a baker, a delicatessen, two fishmongers, a florist and a greengrocer.

In early 2020, the local Council web site provided a summary of the Pannier Market: &quot;Largely unchanged in over 150 years, Barnstaple&#x27;s historic Pannier Market has a wide range of stalls, with everything from fresh local produce, flowers and crafts, to prints and pictures, fashion and... two cafés.&quot;

The Pannier Market, Butchers Row, has been a Grade II listed building since 1951.

==Transport==

In 1989, the A361 North Devon Link Road was built between Barnstaple and the M5 motorway, some 40 miles (65 km) to the east. Traffic congestion in the town was severe, but in May 2007, the Barnstaple Western Bypass was opened to take traffic towards Braunton and Ilfracombe away from the town centre and ancient bridge. It consists of of new road and a long, five-span bridge, and was expected to have cost £42 million. The town&#x27;s main square was remodelled as the entrance to the town centre, and The Strand was closed to traffic. The A39, the Atlantic Highway, follows after the A361 to Bideford and to Bude and then further towards Cornwall.

Most of Barnstaple&#x27;s bus network is run by Stagecoach South West &amp; Filers. The main bus station is at the junction of Queen Street and Belle Meadow Drive. National Express has coach services to London, Heathrow Airport, Taunton, Bristol and Birmingham.

The nearest airport is Exeter Airport.

===Railway===

Barnstaple railway station is the terminus of a branch line from Exeter known as the Tarka Line after a local connection with Tarka the Otter. The station is near the end of the Long Bridge, on the opposite bank of the Taw to the town centre. Several other stations closed with the publication of the &quot;Reshaping of British Railways&quot; (the Beeching Axe) report in the 1960s. The surviving one had been opened on 1 August 1854 by the North Devon Railway (later the London and South Western Railway), although a service had operated from Fremington since 1848 for goods traffic only. The station became &quot;Barnstaple Junction&quot; on 20 July 1874, when the railway opened the branch line to , reverting to plain &quot;Barnstaple&quot; when this was closed on 5 October 1970. It is now a terminus and much reduced in size, as part of the site has been used for the Barnstaple Western Bypass.
The Ilfracombe branch line brought the railway across the river into the town centre. was situated close by the Castle Mound. It closed in 1898 in favour of a nearby station at North Walk, which was also the terminus of the narrow-gauge Lynton and Barnstaple Railway, until that closed in 1935. The narrow-gauge line&#x27;s main operating centre was at nearby .

A separate Barnstaple station, renamed Barnstaple (Victoria Road) in 1949, was opened to the east of the town in 1873 as the terminus of the Devon and Somerset Railway and later part of the Great Western Railway. A junction was provided to allow trains access to Barnstaple Junction and these ran through to Ilfracombe. It was closed in 1970.

==Education==

There are selected primary and secondary state schools and a tertiary college in Barnstaple.

In 2012, 58 per cent of Devon students achieved 5 GCSEs grade A* to C. The UK average is 59 per cent.
Petroc (formerly North Devon College) is a tertiary college offering a wide range of vocational and academic further education to more than 3,000 young people over 16. It was due to spend £100 million on a new campus to be opened on Seven Brethren in 2011, but this fell through when the Learning and Skills Council withdrew £75 million in funding in January 2009. Petroc was launched in September 2009, a year after NDC merged with Tiverton&#x27;s East Devon College.

==Religious sites==

St Peter&#x27;s Church is the parish church of Barnstaple. Its oldest parts probably date to the 13th century, though the nave, chancel and tower date from 1318, when three altars were dedicated by Bishop Stapledon. The north and south aisles were added in about 1670. The church has a notable broach spire, claimed by W. G. Hoskins to be the best of its kind in the country. Inside the church are many mural monuments to 17th-century merchants, such as Raleigh Clapham (died 1636), George Peard (died 1644) and Thomas Horwood (died 1658), reflecting the prosperity of the town at that time. The interior of the church was heavily restored by George Gilbert Scott from 1866, and then by his son John Oldrid Scott into the 1880s, leaving it &quot;dark and dull&quot;, according to Hoskins.

Other religious buildings include St Anne&#x27;s Chapel (a 14th-century chantry chapel, now a museum) in the parish churchyard. The Church of St Mary the Virgin in the suburb of Pilton is 13th-century and a Grade I listed building; Holy Trinity, built in the 1840s but necessarily rebuilt in 1867 as its foundations were unsound. It has a fine tower in the Somerset style. The Roman Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception is said to have been built to designs supplied by Pugin, in Romanesque Revival style. The late 19th-century church of St John the Baptist stands in the Newport area of the town. There is a Baptist chapel of 1870, which includes a lecture hall and classrooms.
