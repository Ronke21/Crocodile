<text>Ezola Broussard Foster (August 9, 1938 – May 22, 2018) was an American conservative political activist, writer, and politician. She was president of the interest group Black Americans for Family Values, author of the book &quot;What&#x27;s Right for All Americans&quot;, and the Reform Party candidate for vice president in the 2000 U.S. presidential election with presidential nominee Pat Buchanan. In April 2002, Foster left the Reform Party for the Constitution Party.

== Early life and career ==
Foster was born and reared in Maurice in Vermilion Parish in southwestern Louisiana, in 1938. In 1960, she graduated with a BA in Business Education from Texas Southern University. She would go on to earn, in 1973, a Master&#x27;s in School Management and Administration from Pepperdine University. In 1960, she moved to Los Angeles, California, where she was employed as a public high school teacher for thirty-three years—teaching typing, business courses, and sometimes English classes.

== Political career ==
=== Early activism ===
Foster first ran for office in 1986, securing the Republican nomination for the California Assembly&#x27;s 48th district. In the general election, she faced incumbent assemblywoman Maxine Waters; a third candidate, Libertarian José &quot;Joe&quot; Castañeda, was also in the race. In the three-person race, Foster placed second, securing 12.77 percent of the vote but losing to Waters by 72 percentage points. In 1992, she was a staunch defender of the police officers in the Rodney King beating case and organized a testimonial dinner for Laurence Powell, one of the convicted officers, in 1995.

In 1994, while teaching at Bell High School in Bell, California, Foster was a public advocate of Proposition 187, a California ballot initiative to deny government programs of social services, health care, and public education to illegal immigrants. Her position was extremely unpopular at the school where she taught, which was 90 percent Hispanic. In 1996, she appeared on PBS&#x27;s &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot; to promote her new political book, &quot;What&#x27;s Right for All Americans&quot;. During her appearance, she argued that illegal immigration was responsible for the low quality of Los Angeles schools; some of her colleagues at the school condemned her in an open letter. Two days later, she attended an anti-illegal immigration rally where several of her supporters were attacked by members of the Progressive Labor Party, who allegedly wanted to harm Foster herself. Shortly thereafter, she left her job, which she calls a necessity resulting from her treatment at work. She went on speaking tours for the John Birch Society and took workers&#x27; compensation for an undisclosed mental disorder—which she describes as &quot;stress&quot; and &quot;anxiety&quot;—until her official retirement as a teacher in 1998.

Foster has appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, &quot;CNN &amp; CO.&quot;, &quot;Nightline, NewsTalk Television&quot;, &quot;CNN Live&quot;, MSNBC, &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, and various CBS, NBC, and ABC newscasts.

=== 2000 election ===

Pat Buchanan, noting Foster&#x27;s conservative media credentials and public speaking ability, asked her to be his running mate after Jim Traficant of Ohio, Teamsters Union president James P. Hoffa, and others declined his request. His critics claimed Foster, who had never held political office, was chosen because she was African American; they likened it to affirmative action, a diversity-increasing policy that Buchanan had always opposed.

Foster, who supported Buchanan&#x27;s campaigns in 1992 and 1996, quit her speaking tour to join the race. While Buchanan was hospitalized during part of the campaign, Foster was the face of the campaign, making television and radio appearances. She is the first African American and second woman (after Geraldine Ferraro) to be nominated for vice president by a party that was recognized and funded by the Federal Election Commission. During the campaign, Foster was the source of some controversy, drawing criticism for her membership with the John Birch Society and for her alleged mental illness which kept her from teaching.

=== Congressional run ===
Foster ran for Congress in the June 5, 2001, special election in California&#x27;s 32nd district to replace deceased representative Julian Dixon as the Reform Party candidate and garnered 1.5% of the vote.

== Personal life ==
Foster was Catholic. Her first marriage ended in annulment, she said, when she found out that her husband was a convicted felon. In 1977 she married Chuck Foster, a truck driver.

<doc id="307248" wikidata="Q465728" url="?curid=307248" title="James Traficant">
<text>James Anthony Traficant, Jr. ( ; May 8, 1941 – September 27, 2014) was an American politician who served as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio. A staunch economic populist known for his flamboyant personality, he represented the , which centered on his hometown of Youngstown and included parts of three counties in northeast Ohio&#x27;s Mahoning Valley.

Traficant was expelled from the House on July 24, 2002, after being convicted of 10 felony counts, including taking bribes, filing false tax returns, racketeering, and forcing his congressional staff to perform chores at his farm in Ohio and houseboat in Washington, D.C. He was sentenced to prison and released on September 2, 2009, after serving a 7-year sentence. Traficant died on September 27, 2014, following a tractor accident at his farm in Green Township, Ohio.

==Early life and education==
Born into a working-class Catholic family in Youngstown, Ohio, Traficant was the son of Agnes (&quot;née&quot; Farkas) and James Anthony Traficant Sr. He was of mostly Italian and Hungarian ancestry. Traficant graduated from Cardinal Mooney High School in 1959 before receiving a B.S. in education from the University of Pittsburgh in 1963. He played quarterback for Pitt&#x27;s football team, and his teammates included Mike Ditka. Traficant was drafted in the NFL&#x27;s twentieth round (276th overall) by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1963, and tried out for the Steelers and the Oakland Raiders of the American Football League, but did not play professionally. He later obtained an M.S. in educational administration from the University of Pittsburgh in 1973 and a second Master&#x27;s degree in counseling from Youngstown State University in 1976.

== Early career ==
At the start of his career, Traficant was the consumer finance director for the Youngstown Community Action Program. He taught courses on drug and alcohol dependency and recovery at Youngstown State University and Kent State University, as well as lecturing on drug and alcohol abuse for colleges and government agencies outside Ohio. In addition, Traficant taught at the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy. He was the executive director of the Mahoning County Drug Program from 1971 to 1981, and Sheriff of Mahoning County from 1981 to 1985. While serving as sheriff, Traficant made national headlines by refusing to execute foreclosure orders on several unemployed homeowners. This endeared him to the local population, which was dealing with a declining economy following the closures and relocations of steel making and steel-associated businesses. Traficant&#x27;s career in Youngstown served as the focus of &quot;Crooked City: Youngstown, OH.,&quot; a podcast produced by Marc Smerling.

In 1983, he was charged with racketeering for accepting bribes. Traficant, who represented himself in the criminal trial, argued that he accepted the bribes only as part of his own alleged secret undercover investigation into corruption. Traficant was acquitted of the charges, becoming the only person ever to win a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) case while representing himself.

Publicity from the RICO trial increased Traficant&#x27;s local visibility. He was elected in 1984 as a Democrat to Congress from Ohio&#x27;s 17th District, defeating Lyle Williams, a three-term Republican incumbent. He was reelected eight times without serious opposition.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Traficant was infamous during his time in Congress for his short, rambling, and often crude rants on the House floor, often decrying his key issues such as his opposition to free trade and the IRS. He usually ended his speeches with the phrase &quot;beam me up&quot;, a &quot;Star Trek&quot; reference. He also became known for his flamboyant fashion sense - including cowboy boots and polyester suits - and his toupee.

While in Congress, Traficant was a supporter of immigration reduction. Traficant&#x27;s major legislative accomplishment in the House was the adoption of some of his proposals to constrain enforcement activities by the Internal Revenue Service against delinquent taxpayers. Traficant was also known for frequently pushing to include &quot;Buy American&quot; provisions in spending bills.

After the Republicans took control of the House in 1995, Traficant tended to vote more often with the Republicans than with his own party. On the issue of abortion, Traficant voted with the position of the National Right to Life Committee 95% of the time in the 105th Congress, and 100% of the time in the 106th and 107th Congresses. However, he voted against all four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton. After he voted for Republican Dennis Hastert for Speaker of the House in 2001, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority and refused to give him any committee assignments. Because the Republicans did not assign him to any committees either, Traficant became the first member of the House of Representatives in over a century (outside the top leadership) to lack a single committee assignment.

Traficant twice asked the FBI to investigate the missing persons case of Philip Taylor Kramer, whose family he knew. The FBI opened a case, but did not launch a new criminal investigation, although it did assist the Ventura County sheriff&#x27;s office in the matter. Traficant&#x27;s office also did some investigation of its own.

===Defense of John Demjanjuk===
Traficant championed the unpopular case of John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian-born autoworker from Seven Hills who had been convicted in Israel and sentenced to hang for having been the brutal Nazi concentration camp guard nicknamed &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;. For almost a decade, Traficant, along with Pat Buchanan, insisted that Demjanjuk had been denied a fair trial, and been the victim of mistaken identity. In 1993, the Supreme Court of Israel overturned the conviction on the basis of reasonable doubt. Demjanjuk was later deported to Germany on May 11, 2009, after the Supreme Court of the United States refused to overturn his deportation order. Demjanjuk was tried and convicted by a German criminal court of being an accessory to murder, but died before the German appellate court could hear his case, thereby voiding the conviction.

===Defense of Arthur Rudolph===
Following Buchanan&#x27;s recommendation to reconsider the denaturalization of former Nazi and NASA scientist Arthur Rudolph, who had been brought to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip, Traficant spoke to the Friends of Arthur Rudolph, an organization based in Huntsville, Alabama. He argued that denaturalization had happened because of a &quot;powerful Jewish lobby&quot; influencing Congress. He added that it was a violation of a U.S. citizen&#x27;s civil rights, and he suggested that Rudolph return to the United States nonetheless. Additionally, he &quot;introduced a resolution in Congress [...] calling for an investigation into the OSI&#x27;s handling of Rudolph&#x27;s case.&quot; Meanwhile, in 1990, Traficant had planned to meet Rudolph at Niagara Falls, on the Canadian–American border, but Rudolph was arrested by immigration officials in Toronto, and the meeting never occurred.

===Trial and expulsion===
On May 4, 2001, Traficant was indicted on federal corruption charges for taking campaign funds for personal use. Again, he opted to represent himself, insisting that the trial was part of a vendetta against him dating back to his 1983 trial. After a two-month federal trial, on April 11, 2002, he was convicted of ten felony counts including bribery, racketeering, and tax evasion.

On July 30, 2002, U.S. District Judge Lesley Wells sentenced Traficant to eight years in prison and fined him $150,000 following his conviction on 10 counts of bribery, racketeering and tax evasion.

Eventually, the House Ethics Committee recommended that Traficant be expelled from Congress. On July 24, the House voted to expel him with 420 members voting yes, 1 member voting no, 9 members voting &#x27;present&#x27;, and 4 members not voting. The sole vote against expulsion was Representative Gary Condit, who at the time was in the midst of a scandal of his own and had been defeated in his reelection primary. Traficant was the first person to be expelled from the House of Representatives since Michael Myers who was expelled in 1980 as a result of the Abscam scandal.

After his expulsion, Traficant ran as an independent candidate for another term in the House while incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary, Allenwood. He received 28,045 votes, or 15 percent. Traficant was one of only a few people in U.S. history to seek federal office while incarcerated. Tim Ryan, a former aide to Traficant, won the election.

== Prison and later life ==

=== Incarceration ===
Traficant entered the Federal Correctional Institution, Allenwood Low, on August 6, 2002, with the Federal Bureau of Prisons ID # 31213-060. He served his first seventeen months at Allenwood. He claimed that he was put in solitary confinement shortly after his arrival for incitement to riot after he told a guard, &quot;People can&#x27;t hear you. Speak up.&quot; During the seven years of his incarceration, Traficant refused any visitors, saying that he did not want anyone to see him. He was released on September 2, 2009, at age 68, and was subject to three years of supervised release.

While in prison, Traficant received support from neo-Nazi David Duke, who urged visitors to his personal website to donate to his personal fund. Duke posted a letter written by Traficant stating that he was targeted by the United States Department of Justice for, among other things, defending John Demjanjuk. Traficant also claimed, in the letter, that he knew facts about &quot;Waco, Ruby Ridge, Pan Am Flight 103, Jimmy Hoffa and the John F. Kennedy assassination&quot;, which he may divulge in the future. Author Michael Collins Piper, who wrote &quot;Target: Traficant, The Untold Story&quot; initially helped circulate Traficant&#x27;s letter, said that &quot;There&#x27;s stuff I&#x27;ve written about Traficant that&#x27;s showing up in places I don&#x27;t even know. It&#x27;s like (six) degrees of separation with the Internet now,&quot; and denied that Traficant had any direct connections to Duke.

=== Release ===
Traficant was released from prison on September 2, 2009. On September 6, 2009, 1,200 supporters welcomed him home at a banquet with an Elvis impersonator, and a Traficant lookalike contest. &quot;Welcome home Jimbo&quot; was printed on T-shirts. &quot;I think it&#x27;s time to tell the FBI and the IRS that this is our country and we&#x27;re tired—tired of the pressure, tired of the political targeting, tired of a powerful central government that is crippling America,&quot; he said. He also said he was considering running for his old seat in Congress. Traficant signed a limited, three-month contract to work as a part-time weekend talk radio host for Cleveland news/talk station WTAM in January 2010. His contract permitted him to quit if he chose to run for office.

On November 2, 2009, a column by Traficant in the &quot;American Free Press&quot; continued his defense of the accused concentration camp guard John Demjanjuk.

=== 2010 congressional campaign ===
In September 2010, Traficant was certified to run for the same seat he held before his expulsion, and said that his platform would be to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Traficant lost the election to his former aide, Tim Ryan, to whom he lost an earlier race in 2002. Traficant received 30,556 votes, or 16%.

== Post-prison life ==
After his release from prison, Traficant was featured as a guest speaker at a Tea Party protest in Columbiana, Ohio.

Traficant began a grassroots campaign in July 2014, Project Freedom USA, to, among other things, put pressure on Congress to get rid of the IRS and &quot;divorce&quot; the Federal Reserve. He continued to live on the farm that he had purchased in 1987.

==Accident and death==
Traficant was injured in an accident at his farm in Greenford, Ohio, on September 23, 2014. A tractor he was driving into a pole barn flipped over and trapped him underneath. Traficant was taken to Salem Regional Medical Center in Salem, Ohio, then airlifted to St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Health Center in Youngstown. On the evening of September 24, his wife described him as &quot;sedated and not doing well&quot;.

A text message was sent out Friday evening September 26 by Jim Condit Jr., the Constitution Party candidate for Ohio&#x27;s 8th congressional district and a close friend who had been traveling with Traficant to help promote Project Freedom USA. The text message stated that &quot;the machines were disconnected at 2:00 p.m. (Friday). He is still breathing. Thousands are praying.&quot; On September 27, 2014, Traficant died at a hospice in Poland, Ohio, aged 73. By September 29, Traficant&#x27;s body had been buried in an undisclosed location after the family had a private funeral, and announced that there would be no public funeral for him.

A subsequent medical investigation determined that Traficant had not had a heart attack or seizure before the accident, and was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In addition, he had not sustained any crushing injuries in the accident. The forensic pathologist who conducted the examination attributed Traficant&#x27;s death to positional asphyxiation, stating that he had been unable to breathe because of the weight of the tractor on top of him.

<text>Pat Choate (; born April 27, 1941) is an American economist who is most known for being the 1996 Reform Party candidate for Vice President of the United States, the running-mate of Ross Perot. Following the 1996 election, the Federal Election Commission certified the Reform Party as a national political party eligible for federal campaign matching funds, a historic first.

==Life and career==
Choate was born in Maypearl, Texas, the son of Bettie Lee (Simpson) and Frank William Choate. He is the director of the Manufacturing Policy Project, which studies long-term U.S. economic policy. He previously worked as Director of Research and Planning for the Oklahoma Industrial Development Commission; as Tennessee&#x27;s first Commissioner of Economic and Community Development; as the Director of the Appalachian and then Southern Regional Offices of the U.S. Department of Commerce&#x27;s Economic Development Administration (EDA); as Director of the EDA Office of Economic Research; as the Senior Economist in the Office of Management and Budget&#x27;s Trade Reorganization Project; as a Fellow at the Battelle Institute&#x27;s Academy for Contemporary Problems and as Vice President of Public Policy at TRW, Inc. He has served on several Presidential and Congressional commissions on education, infrastructure and national security.

He was a co-founder of the Congressional Economic Leadership Institute (CELI) in 1986 and served as its Chair or Co-Chair for 18 years. Choate is married to Kay Casey and has one grown stepson. Pat Choate and his wife live near Washington, Virginia. He has a BA from the University of Texas at Arlington and an MA and PhD from the University of Oklahoma, all in economics. In 1994, the University of Oklahoma named him the Arthur Barto Adams Alumni Fellow in recognition of his continuing scholarship. He has taught a course called Advanced Issues Management at George Washington University&#x27;s Graduate School of Political Management. He is known for his work on development economics, including infrastructure and intellectual property, and his strong stance against unfettered globalism. He is also on the Board of Directors for the American Innovators for Patent Reform.

He hosted a weekly radio show called &quot;The Week Ahead&quot; from 1994 to 1996 and &quot;The Pat Choate Show&quot; from 1997 to 2000.

<doc id="307251" wikidata="Q184751" url="?curid=307251" title="Dalmatian pelican">
<text>The Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) is the largest member of the pelican family and perhaps the world&#x27;s largest freshwater bird, although rivaled in weight and length by the largest swans. They are elegant soaring birds, with wingspans rivaling those of the great albatrosses, and their flocks fly in graceful synchrony. With a range spanning across much of Central Eurasia, from the eastern Mediterranean in the west to the Taiwan Strait in the east, and from the Persian Gulf in the south to Siberia in the north, it is a short-to-medium-distance migrant between breeding and overwintering areas. No subspecies are known to exist over its wide range, but based on size differences, a Pleistocene paleosubspecies, &quot;P. c. palaeocrispus,&quot; has been described from fossils recovered at Binagadi raion in Azerbaijan.

As with other pelicans, the males are larger than the females, and likewise their diet is mainly fish. Their curly nape feathers, grey legs and silvery-white plumage are distinguishing features, and the wings appear solid grey in flight. The adults acquire a drabber plumage in winter, however, when they may be mistaken for great white pelicans. Their harsh vocalizations become more pronounced during the mating season. They breed across the Palearctic from southeastern Europe to Russia, India and China in swamps and shallow lakes. They usually return to traditional breeding sites, where they are less social than other pelican species. Their nests are crude heaps of vegetation, which are placed on islands or dense mats of vegetation.

The species&#x27; numbers dramatically declined during the 20th century, partly due to land use, disturbance and poaching activities. The core population survives in Russia, but in its Mongolian range, it is critically endangered. Removal of power lines to prevent bird strike or electrocution and constructing nesting platforms or rafts have reversed declines locally.

==Description==

This huge bird is by a slight margin the largest of the pelican species and one of the largest living flying bird species. It measures in length, in weight and in wingspan. Its median weight is around , which makes it perhaps the world&#x27;s heaviest flying bird species, although the largest individuals among male bustards and swans may be heavier than the largest individual Dalmatian pelican. More recently, six male Dalmatians were found to average and four females , around the same average weight as the great white pelican (&quot;Pelecanus onocrotalus&quot;) and slightly lighter than mean body masses from other huge birds such as the trumpeter swan (&quot;Cygnus buccinator&quot;) or Andean condor (&quot;Vultur gryphus&quot;). Reportedly, adult males weighed a median of per another source. A mean estimated body mass for the Dalmatian pelican of was also published, around the same mass as the aforementioned largest swan and condor. It is either the heaviest or one of the heaviest birds native to Europe, its closest rival in mass being mute swans (&quot;Cygnus olor&quot;), which weighs on average around , followed closely by the cinereous vulture (&quot;Aegypius monachus&quot;) (whose average weight is not known) and the whooper swans (&quot;Cygnus cygnus&quot;), averaging at just shy of , and the great white pelican. These same five species are probably rank as the largest flying birds in Asia as well, alongside the Himalayan vulture (&quot;Gyps himalayensis&quot;). It also appears to have one of the largest wingspans of any living bird, rivaling those of the great albatrosses (&quot;Diomedea&quot; ssp., in particular the two largest species, the wandering albatross and southern royal albatross) and the great white pelican. These four species are the only modern birds with verified wingspans that range over .

The somewhat similar-looking great white pelican broadly overlaps in size but has greater size sexual dimorphism: female great whites can be noticeably smaller than female Dalmatians but male individuals of the two species are essentially the same size and weight. However, the Dalmatian differs from this other very large species in that it has curly nape feathers, grey legs and silvery-white (rather than pure white) plumage. In winter, adult Dalmatian pelicans go from silvery-grey to a brownish-grey cream colour. Immature birds are grey and lack the pink facial patch of immature white pelicans. The loose feathers around the forehead of the Dalmatian pelican can form a W-like-shape on the face right above the bill. In the breeding season it has an orange-red lower mandible and pouch against a yellow upper mandible. In winter, the whole bill is a somewhat dull yellow. The bill, at long, is the second largest of any bird, after the Australian pelican (&quot;Pelecanus conspicillatus&quot;). The bare skin around the eye can vary from yellow to purplish in colour. Among standard measurements, compared to the great white pelican, the Dalmatian&#x27;s tarsus is slightly shorter, at , but its tail and wing chord length are notably larger, at long and , respectively. When the Dalmatian pelican is in flight, unlike other pelicans, its wings are solid grayish-white with black tips. It is an elegant soaring bird. When a whole flock of Dalmatian pelicans is in flight, all its members move in graceful synchrony, their necks held back like a heron&#x27;s.

The Dalmatian pelican is often silent, as most pelicans tend to be, although it can be fairly vocal during the mating season, when it may engage in a wide range of guttural, deep vocalisations, including barks, hisses and grunts.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Dalmatian pelican is found in lakes, rivers, deltas and estuaries. Compared to the great white pelican, the Dalmatian is not as tied to lowland areas and will nest in suitable wetlands with many elevations. It is less opportunistic in breeding habitat selection than the great white, usually returning to a traditional breeding site year after year unless it becomes completely unsuitable. During the winter, Dalmatian pelicans usually stay on ice-free lakes in Europe or &quot;jheels&quot; (seasonal lakes) in India. They also visit, typically during winter, inshore areas along sheltered coasts for feeding.

==Movements==
This pelican usually migrates short distances with varying migration patterns during the year. It is dispersive in Europe, based on feeding opportunities, with most western birds staying through the winter in the Mediterranean region. In the Danube Delta, Dalmatian pelicans arrive in March and leave by the end of August. It is more actively migratory in Asia, where most of the birds that breed in Russia fly down for the winter to the central Middle East, largely around Iran through to the Indian subcontinent, from Sri Lanka, Nepal to central India. The pelicans that breed in Mongolia winter along the east coast of China, including the Hong Kong area.

In general, the species prefers relatively warm temperatures. During periods where the climate was warmer, the Dalmatian pelican was far more widespread in Europe (today its European range is restricted to the southeastern part of the continent). Notably, a large number of subfossil bones dating from 7400–5000 Before Present (BP), coinciding with the Holocene climatic optimum, have been found in Denmark, and bones dating from 1900–600 BP have been found in central Europe, Netherlands and Britain. This preference for warmer temperatures is also supported by movements recorded in recent history, as there are indications of a slow range expansion in response to climate change.

==Behaviour==
===Feeding===
This pelican feeds almost entirely on fish. Preferred prey species can include common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;), European perch (&quot;Perca fluviatilis&quot;), common rudd (&quot;Scardinius erythropthalmus&quot;), eels, catfish (especially silurids during winter), mullet and northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;), the latter having measured up to when taken. In the largest remnant colony, located in Greece, the preferred prey is reportedly the native &quot;Alburnus belvica&quot;. The Dalmatian pelican requires around of fish per day and can take locally abundant smaller fish such as gobies, but usually ignore them in favour of slightly larger fish. It usually forages alone or in groups of only two or three. It normally swims along, placidly and slowly, until it quickly dunks its head underwater and scoops the fish out, along with great masses of water. The water is dumped out of the sides of the pouch and the fish is swallowed. Occasionally it may feed cooperatively with other pelicans by corralling fish into shallow waters and may even cooperate similarly while fishing alongside great cormorants in Greece. Occasionally, the pelican may not immediately eat the fish contained in its gular pouch, so it can save the prey for later consumption. Other small wetlands-dwellers may supplement the diet, including crustaceans, worms, beetles and small water birds, usually nestlings and eggs.

===Breeding===
Among a highly social family in general, Dalmatian pelicans may have the least social inclinations. This species naturally nests in relatively small groups compared to most other pelican species and sometimes may even nest alone. However, small colonies are usually formed, which regularly include upwards of 250 pairs (especially historically). Occasionally, Dalmatian pelicans may mix in with colonies of great white pelicans. Nesting sites selected are usually either islands in large bodies of water (typically lagoons or river deltas) or dense mats of aquatic vegetation, such as extensive reedbeds of &quot;Phragmites&quot; and &quot;Typha&quot;. Due to their large size, these pelicans often trample the vegetation in the area surrounding their nests into the muddy substrate and thus nesting sites may become unsuitably muddy after around three years of usage.

The nest is a moderately-sized pile of grass, reeds, sticks, and feathers, usually measuring about deep and across. Nests are usually located on or near the ground, often being placed on dense floating vegetation. Nests tend to be flimsy until cemented together by droppings. Breeding commences in March or April, about a month before the great white pelican breeds. The Dalmatian pelican lays a clutch of one to six eggs, with two eggs being the norm. Eggs weigh between . Incubation, which is split between both parents, lasts for 30 to 34 days. The chicks are born naked but soon sprout white down feathers. Aggressive behaviors between siblings are very rare and generally non-fatal. When the young are 6 to 7 weeks of age, the pelicans frequently gather in &quot;pods&quot;. The offspring fledge at around 85 days and become independent at 100 to 105 days old. Nesting success relies on local environmental conditions, with anywhere from 58% to 100% of hatchlings successfully surviving to adulthood. Sexual maturity is thought to be obtained at three or four years of age.

===Predators===
Predation on Dalmatian pelicans is relatively poorly known despite the species&#x27; threatened status. Adult birds have no natural enemies and the nesting sites often insure limited nest predation, though carnivorous mammals which eat eggs and nestlings can access nests when water levels are low enough for them to cross, as has been recorded with wild boars (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) destroying nests in Bulgaria. Golden jackals (&quot;Canis aureus&quot;) are also known to access and destroy nests when water levels are too low and the same is possibly true of other canids such as foxes, gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) and dogs (&quot;C. l. familiaris&quot;), not to mention other predatory animals such as potentially Eurasian lynxes (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;). Some eagles may attack pelicans at colonies, although this is not verified. Large gulls are known to be virulent predators of Dalmatian pelican eggs in Russia, Albania and Turkey.

==Status==

This species of pelican has declined greatly throughout its range, more so than the white pelican. It is possible that up to 10,000–20,000 pelicans exist at the species level. During the 20th century, the species&#x27; numbers underwent a dramatic decline for reasons that are not entirely understood. The most likely reason was habitat loss due to human activities such as the drainage of wetlands and land development. Colonies are regularly disturbed by human activity, and, like all pelicans, the parents may temporarily leave their nest if threatened, which then exposes the chicks to the risk of predation. Occasionally, Dalmatian pelicans may be shot by fishermen who believe the birds are dangerously depleting the fish population and hence threatening their livelihood. While such killings are generally on a small scale, the worry that these pelicans over-exploit the fishing stock persists in many locales. Another probable reason for the decline in the species&#x27; population is poaching. In Mongolia, the local people clandestinely kill these pelicans to use or sell their bills as pouches. On a typical day in a commercial Mongolian marketplace, as many as fifty pelican bills may be on offer for sale, and they are considered such a rare prize that ten horses and thirty sheep are considered a fair price to trade for a single pelican. Due to exploitation at all stages of the life cycle, the species is critically endangered in its Mongolian range, with a total population of fewer than 130 individual birds. Dalmatian pelicans also regularly fly into power-lines and are killed by electrocution. In Greece, pelicans are often so disturbed by power boats, usually ones bearing tourists—that they become unable to feed and die of malnourishment. In 1994 in Europe there were over a thousand breeding pairs, most of them in Greece, but also in Ukraine, Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria (Srebarna Nature Reserve) and Albania (Karavasta Lagoon). They have been considered extinct in Croatia since the 1950s, although a single Dalmatian pelican was observed there in 2011. The largest single remaining colony is at Small Prespa Lake (shared between Albania and Greece), with around 1,600 pairs, with approximately 450 pairs left in the Danube Delta. The country with the largest breeding population today, including about 70% of pairs or possibly over 3,000 pairs, is Russia. Worldwide, there are an estimated 3,000–5,000 breeding pairs. One report of approximately 8,000 Dalmatian pelicans in India turned out to be a congregation of misidentified great white pelicans.

The Dalmatian pelican is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. Conservation efforts have been undertaken on behalf of the species, especially in Europe. Although they normally nest on the ground, Dalmatian pelicans have nested on platforms put out in Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania in order to encourage them to breed. Rafts over water have also been set up for the species to use in Greece and Bulgaria. Power-lines have also been marked or dismantled in areas adjacent to colonies in these countries. Additionally, water-level management and educational programs may be aiding them at a local level. Although efforts have been undertaken in Asia, there is a much higher rate of poaching, shooting and habitat destruction there, which may make conservation efforts more difficult. In 2012, when unusually frigid winter conditions caused the Caspian Sea to freeze over, it resulted in the death from starvation of at least twenty of the Dalmatian pelicans that overwinter there. Despite local authorities&#x27; initial attempts to discourage it, many people there turned out with fish and hand-fed the birds, apparently enabling the huge pelicans to survive the winter.

<text>A trade bloc is a type of intergovernmental agreement, often part of a regional intergovernmental organization, where barriers to trade (tariffs and others) are reduced or eliminated among the participating states.

Trade blocs can be stand-alone agreements between several states (such as the USMCA) or part of a regional organization (such as the European Union). Depending on the level of economic integration, trade blocs can be classified as preferential trading areas, free-trade areas, customs unions, common markets, or economic and monetary unions.

==Use==
Historic trading blocs include the Hanseatic League, a Northern European economic alliance between the 12th and 17th centuries, and the German Customs Union, formed on the basis of the German Confederation and subsequently the German Empire from 1871. Surges of trade bloc formation occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as in the 1990s after the collapse of Communism. By 1997, more than 50% of all world commerce was conducted within regional trade blocs. Economist Jeffrey J. Schott of the Peterson Institute for International Economics notes that members of successful trade blocs usually share four common traits: similar levels of per capita GNP, geographic proximity, similar or compatible trading regimes, and political commitment to regional organization.

Some advocates of global free trade are opposed to trading blocs. Trade blocs are seen by them to encourage regional free trade at the expense of global free trade. Those who advocate for it claim that global free trade is in the interest of every country, as it would create more opportunities to turn local resources into goods and services that are both currently in demand and will be in demand in the future by consumers. However, scholars and economists continue to debate whether regional trade blocs fragment the global economy or encourage the extension of the existing global multilateral trading system.

== Terminology ==
A common market is seen as a stage of economic integration towards an economic union or possibly towards the goal of a unified market.

A single market is a type of trade bloc in which most trade barriers have been removed (for goods) with some common policies on product regulation, and freedom of movement of the factors of production (capital and labour) and of enterprise and services.

<doc id="307257" wikidata="Q2093460" url="?curid=307257" title="Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter">
<text>Roscoe Henry Hillenkoetter (May 8, 1897 – June 18, 1982) was the third director of the post–World War II United States Central Intelligence Group (CIG), the third Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), and the first director of the Central Intelligence Agency created by the National Security Act of 1947. He served as DCI and director of the CIG and the CIA from May 1, 1947, to October 7, 1950, and, after his retirement from the United States Navy, was a member of the board of governors of National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) from 1957 to 1962.

==Education and military career==

Born in St. Louis, Missouri on May 8, 1897, Hillenkoetter graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, in 1919. He served with the Atlantic Fleet during World War I and joined the Office of Naval Intelligence in 1933. He served several tours in naval intelligence, including as assistant naval attaché to France, Spain, and Portugal. During the Spanish Civil War, he coordinated the evacuation of Americans from the country. After the German invasion of France, Hillenkoetter entered Vichy France and aided the underground movement. As executive officer of the , he was wounded during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and afterwards was officer in charge of intelligence on Chester W. Nimitz&#x27;s Pacific Fleet staff until 1943. He briefly served as commander of the destroyer tender USS &quot;Dixie&quot; before joining the Bureau of Naval Personnel in 1944.

After the war, then-Captain Hillenkoetter commanded the in 1946 before returning to his pre-war posting as naval attaché in Paris before becoming head of the Central Intelligence Group (CIG) in May 1947.

==Director of Central Intelligence==

President Truman persuaded a reluctant Hillenkoetter, then a rear admiral, to become Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), and run the Central Intelligence Group (September 1947). Under the National Security Act of 1947 he was nominated and confirmed by the U.S. Senate as DCI, now in charge of the newly established Central Intelligence Agency (December 1947). At first, the U.S. State Department directed the new CIA&#x27;s covert operations component, and George F. Kennan chose Frank Wisner to be its director. Hillenkoetter expressed doubt that the same agency could be effective at both covert action and intelligence analysis.

As DCI, Hillenkoetter was periodically called to testify before Congress. One instance concerned the CIA&#x27;s first major Soviet intelligence failure, the failure to predict the Soviet atomic bomb test (August 29, 1949). In the weeks following the test, but prior to the CIA&#x27;s detection of it, Hillenkoetter released the September 20, 1949 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) stating, &quot;the earliest possible date by which the USSR might be expected to produce an atomic bomb is mid-1950 and the most probable date is mid-1953.&quot; Hillenkoetter was called before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (JCAE) to explain how the CIA not only failed to predict the test, but also how they did not even detect it after it occurred. JCAE members were steaming that the CIA could be taken by such surprise. Hillenkoetter imprecisely replied that the CIA knew it would take the Soviets approximately five years to build the bomb, but the CIA misjudged when they started:

We knew that they were working on it, and we started here, and this organization [CIA] was set up after the war and we started in the middle and we didn&#x27;t know when they had started and it had to be picked up from what we could get along there. That is what I say: this thing of getting a fact that you definitely have on the exploding of this bomb has helped us in going back and looking over what we had before, and it will help us in what we get in the future. But you picked up in the mid-air on the thing, and we didn&#x27;t know when they started, sir.

The JCAE was not satisfied with Hillenkoetter&#x27;s answer, and his and the CIA&#x27;s reputation suffered among government heads in Washington, even though the press did not write about the CIA&#x27;s first Soviet intelligence failure.

The U.S. government had no intelligence warning of North Korea&#x27;s invasion (June 25, 1950) of South Korea. DCI Hillenkoetter convened an ad hoc group to prepare estimates of likely communist behavior on the Korean peninsula; it worked well enough that his successor institutionalized it.

Two days prior to North Korea&#x27;s invasion of South Korea, Hillenkoetter went before Congress (the House Foreign Affairs Committee) and testified that the CIA had good sources in Korea, implying that the CIA would be able to provide warning before any invasion. Following the invasion, the press suspected the administration was surprised by it, and wondered whether Hillenkoetter would be removed. The DCI was not influential with President Harry S. Truman, but Hillenkoetter insisted to the President that as the Director of Central Intelligence, it would be politically advantageous to testify before Congress to try to remedy the situation. After the testimony, some Senators told the Washington Post that Hillenkoetter confused them when explaining the CIA did not predict when North Korea would invade by saying it was not the CIA&#x27;s job to analyze intelligence, just to pass it on to high-ranking policymakers. Even though most senators believed Hillenkoetter ably explained the CIA&#x27;s performance, many at the CIA were embarrassed by the news reports, and by mid-August the rumors of Hillenkoetter&#x27;s removal were confirmed when President Truman announced that General Walter Bedell &quot;Beetle&quot; Smith would replace him as DCI.

President Truman installed a new DCI in October. Nebraska Congressman Howard Buffett alleged that Hillenkoetter&#x27;s classified testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee &quot;established American responsibility for the Korean outbreak,&quot; and sought to have it declassified until his death in 1964.

==Resumption of active military duty==

Admiral Hillenkoetter returned to the fleet, commanding Cruiser Division 1 of the Cruiser-Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet from October 1950 to August 1951 during the Korean War. He then commanded the Third Naval District with headquarters in New York City from July 1952 to August 1956 and was promoted to the rank of vice admiral on 9 April 1956.

His last assignment was as Inspector General of the Navy from 1 August 1956 until his retirement from the Navy on 1 May 1957.

==Board member of NICAP==

The National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena was formed in 1956, with the organization&#x27;s corporate charter being approved October 24. Hillenkoetter was on NICAP&#x27;s board of governors from about 1957 until 1962. Donald E. Keyhoe, NICAP director and Hillenkoetter&#x27;s Naval Academy classmate, wrote that Hillenkoetter wanted public disclosure of UFO evidence. Perhaps Hillenkoetter&#x27;s best-known statement on the subject was in 1960 in a letter to Congress, as reported in The New York Times: &quot;Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.&quot;

==Death==
Hillenkoetter lived in Weehawken, New Jersey, following his retirement from the Navy, until his death on June 18, 1982, at New York City&#x27;s Mount Sinai Hospital.

==In fiction==
Actor Leon Russom portrayed Hillenkoetter in an episode of &quot;Dark Skies&quot;, a 1996 television series presenting a story based conspiracies related to UFOs.

<doc id="307258" wikidata="Q1758953" url="?curid=307258" title="Le Sage's theory of gravitation">
<text>Le Sage&#x27;s theory of gravitation is a kinetic theory of gravity originally proposed by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier in 1690 and later by Georges-Louis Le Sage in 1748. The theory proposed a mechanical explanation for Newton&#x27;s gravitational force in terms of streams of tiny unseen particles (which Le Sage called ultra-mundane corpuscles) impacting all material objects from all directions. According to this model, any two material bodies partially shield each other from the impinging corpuscles, resulting in a net imbalance in the pressure exerted by the impact of corpuscles on the bodies, tending to drive the bodies together. This mechanical explanation for gravity never gained widespread acceptance.

== Basic theory ==
The theory posits that the force of gravity is the result of tiny particles (corpuscles) moving at high speed in all directions, throughout the universe. The intensity of the flux of particles is assumed to be the same in all directions, so an isolated object A is struck equally from all sides, resulting in only an inward-directed pressure but no net directional force (P1).

With a second object &quot;B&quot; present, however, a fraction of the particles that would otherwise have struck A from the direction of B is intercepted, so B works as a shield, i.e. from the direction of B, A will be struck by fewer particles than from the opposite direction. Likewise B will be struck by fewer particles from the direction of A than from the opposite direction. One can say that A and B are &quot;shadowing&quot; each other, and the two bodies are pushed toward each other by the resulting imbalance of forces (P2). Thus the apparent attraction between bodies is, according to this theory, actually a diminished push from the direction of other bodies, so the theory is sometimes called &quot;push gravity&quot; or &quot;shadow gravity&quot;, although it is more widely referred to as &quot;Lesage gravity&quot;.

=== Nature of collisions ===

If the collisions of body A and the gravific particles are fully elastic, the intensity of the reflected particles would be as strong as of the incoming ones, so no net directional force would arise. The same is true if a second body B is introduced, where B acts as a shield against gravific particles in the direction of A. The gravific particle C which ordinarily would strike on A is blocked by B, but another particle D which ordinarily would not have struck A, is re-directed by the reflection on B, and therefore replaces C. Thus if the collisions are fully elastic, the reflected particles between A and B would fully compensate any shadowing effect. In order to account for a net gravitational force, it must be assumed that the collisions are not fully elastic, or at least that the reflected particles are slowed, so that their momentum is reduced after the impact. This would result in streams with diminished momentum departing from A, and streams with undiminished momentum arriving at A, so a net directional momentum toward the center of A would arise (P3). Under this assumption, the reflected particles in the two-body case will not fully compensate the shadowing effect, because the reflected flux is weaker than the incident flux.

=== Inverse square law ===

Since it is assumed that some or all of the gravific particles converging on an object are either absorbed or slowed by the object, it follows that the intensity of the flux of gravific particles emanating from the direction of a massive object is less than the flux converging on the object. We can imagine this imbalance of momentum flow – and therefore of the force exerted on any other body in the vicinity – distributed over a spherical surface centered on the object (P4). The imbalance of momentum flow over an entire spherical surface enclosing the object is independent of the size of the enclosing sphere, whereas the surface area of the sphere increases in proportion to the square of the radius. Therefore, the momentum imbalance per unit area decreases inversely as the square of the distance.

=== Mass proportionality ===
From the premises outlined so far, there arises only a force which is proportional to the surface of the bodies. But gravity is proportional to the masses. To satisfy the need for mass proportionality, the theory posits that a) the basic elements of matter are very small so that gross matter consists mostly of empty space, and b) that the particles are so small, that only a small fraction of them would be intercepted by gross matter. The result is, that the &quot;shadow&quot; of each body is proportional to the surface of every single element of matter. If it is then assumed that the elementary opaque elements of all matter are identical (i.e., having the same ratio of density to area), it will follow that the shadow effect is, at least approximately, proportional to the mass (P5).
== Fatio ==

Nicolas Fatio presented the first formulation of his thoughts on gravitation in a letter to Christiaan Huygens in the spring of 1690. Two days later Fatio read the content of the letter before the Royal Society in London. In the following years Fatio composed several draft manuscripts of his major work &quot;De la Cause de la Pesanteur&quot;, but none of this material was published in his lifetime. In 1731 Fatio also sent his theory as a Latin poem, in the style of Lucretius, to the Paris Academy of Science, but it was dismissed. Some fragments of these manuscripts and copies of the poem were later acquired by Le Sage who failed to find a publisher for Fatio&#x27;s papers. So it lasted until 1929, when the only complete copy of Fatio&#x27;s manuscript was published by Karl Bopp, and in 1949 Gagnebin used the collected fragments in possession of Le Sage to reconstruct the paper. The Gagnebin edition includes revisions made by Fatio as late as 1743, forty years after he composed the draft on which the Bopp edition was based. However, the second half of the Bopp edition contains the mathematically most advanced parts of Fatio&#x27;s theory, and were not included by Gagnebin in his edition. For a detailed analysis of Fatio&#x27;s work, and a comparison between the Bopp and the Gagnebin editions, see Zehe. The following description is mainly based on the Bopp edition.

=== Features of Fatio&#x27;s theory ===
==== Fatio&#x27;s pyramid (Problem I) ====

Fatio assumed that the universe is filled with minute particles, which are moving indiscriminately with very high speed and rectilinearly in all directions. To illustrate his thoughts he used the following example: Suppose an object &quot;C&quot;, on which an infinite small plane zz and a sphere centered about &quot;zz&quot; is drawn. Into this sphere Fatio placed the pyramid &quot;PzzQ&quot;, in which some particles are streaming in the direction of &quot;zz&quot; and also some particles, which were already reflected by &quot;C&quot; and therefore depart from &quot;zz&quot;. Fatio proposed that the mean velocity of the reflected particles is lower and therefore their momentum is weaker than that of the incident particles. The result is &quot;one stream&quot;, which pushes all bodies in the direction of &quot;zz&quot;. So on one hand the speed of the stream remains constant, but on the other hand at larger proximity to &quot;zz&quot; the density of the stream increases and therefore its intensity is proportional to 1/&quot;r&quot;2. And because one can draw an infinite number of such pyramids around &quot;C&quot;, the proportionality applies to the entire range around &quot;C&quot;.

==== Reduced speed ====
In order to justify the assumption, that the particles are traveling after their reflection with diminished velocities, Fatio stated the following assumptions:
* Either ordinary matter, or the gravific particles, or both are inelastic, or
* the impacts are fully elastic, but the particles are not absolutely hard, and therefore are in a state of vibration after the impact, and/or
* due to friction the particles begin to rotate after their impacts.
These passages are the most incomprehensible parts of Fatio&#x27;s theory, because he never clearly decided which sort of collision he actually preferred. However, in the last version of his theory in 1742 he shortened the related passages and ascribed &quot;perfect elasticity or spring force&quot; to the particles and on the other hand &quot;imperfect elasticity&quot; to gross matter, therefore the particles would be reflected with diminished velocities. Additionally, Fatio faced another problem: What is happening if the particles collide with each other? Inelastic collisions would lead to a steady decrease of the particle speed and therefore a decrease of the gravitational force. To avoid this problem, Fatio supposed that the diameter of the particles is very small compared to their mutual distance, so their interactions are very rare.

==== Condensation ====
Fatio thought for a long time that, since corpuscles approach material bodies at a higher speed than they recede from them (after reflection), there would be a progressive accumulation of corpuscles near material bodies (an effect which he called &quot;condensation&quot;). However, he later realized that although the incoming corpuscles are quicker, they are spaced further apart than are the reflected corpuscles, so the inward and outward flow rates are the same. Hence there is no secular accumulation of corpuscles, i.e., the density of the reflected corpuscles remains constant (assuming that they are small enough that no noticeably greater rate of self-collision occurs near the massive body). More importantly, Fatio noted that, by increasing both the velocity and the elasticity of the corpuscles, the difference between the speeds of the incoming and reflected corpuscles (and hence the difference in densities) can be made arbitrarily small while still maintaining the same effective gravitational force.

==== Porosity of gross matter ====

In order to ensure mass proportionality, Fatio assumed that gross matter is extremely permeable to the flux of corpuscles. He sketched 3 models to justify this assumption:
* He assumed that matter is an accumulation of small &quot;balls&quot; whereby their diameter compared with their distance among themselves is &quot;infinitely&quot; small. But he rejected this proposal, because under this condition the bodies would approach each other and therefore would not remain stable.
* Then he assumed that the balls could be connected through bars or lines and would form some kind of crystal lattice. However, he rejected this model too – if several atoms are together, the gravific fluid is not able to penetrate this structure equally in all direction, and therefore mass proportionality is impossible.
* At the end Fatio also removed the balls and only left the lines or the net. By making them &quot;infinitely&quot; smaller than their distance among themselves, thereby a maximum penetration capacity could be achieved.

==== Pressure force of the particles (Problem II) ====
Already in 1690 Fatio assumed, that the &quot;push force&quot; exerted by the particles on a plain surface is the sixth part of the force, which would be produced if all particles are lined up normal to the surface. Fatio now gave a proof of this proposal by determination of the force, which is exerted by the particles on a certain point zz. He derived the formula &quot;p&quot; = &quot;ρv&quot;2&quot;zz&quot;/6. This solution is very similar to the formula known in the kinetic theory of gases &quot;p&quot; = &quot;ρv&quot;2/3, which was found by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738. This was the first time that a solution analogous to the similar result in kinetic theory was pointed out – long &quot;before&quot; the basic concept of the latter theory was developed. However, Bernoulli&#x27;s value is twice as large as Fatio&#x27;s one, because according to Zehe, Fatio only calculated the value &quot;mv&quot; for the change of impulse after the collision, but not 2&quot;mv&quot; and therefore got the wrong result. (His result is only correct in the case of totally inelastic collisions.) Fatio tried to use his solution not only for explaining gravitation, but for explaining the behaviour of gases as well. He tried to construct a thermometer, which should indicate the &quot;state of motion&quot; of the air molecules and therefore estimate the temperature. But Fatio (unlike Bernoulli) did not &quot;identify&quot; heat and the movements of the air particles – he used another fluid, which should be responsible for this effect. It is also unknown, whether Bernoulli was influenced by Fatio or not.

==== Infinity (Problem III) ====
In this chapter Fatio examines the connections between the term &quot;infinity&quot; and its relations to his theory. Fatio often justified his considerations with the fact that different phenomena are &quot;infinitely smaller or larger&quot; than others and so many problems can be reduced to an undetectable value. For example, the diameter of the bars is infinitely smaller than their distance to each other; or the speed of the particles is infinitely larger than those of gross matter; or the speed difference between reflected and non-reflected particles is infinitely small.

==== Resistance of the medium (Problem IV) ====
This is the mathematically most complex part of Fatio&#x27;s theory. There he tried to estimate the resistance of the particle streams for moving bodies. Supposing &quot;u&quot; is the velocity of gross matter, &quot;v&quot; is the velocity of the gravific particles and &quot;ρ&quot; the density of the medium. In the case &quot;v&quot; ≪ &quot;u&quot; and &quot;ρ&quot; = constant Fatio stated that the resistance is &quot;ρu&quot;2. In the case &quot;v&quot; ≫ &quot;u&quot; and &quot;ρ&quot; = constant the resistance is 4/3&quot;ρuv&quot;. Now, Newton stated that the lack of resistance to the orbital motion requires an extreme sparseness of any medium in space. So Fatio decreased the density of the medium and stated, that to maintain sufficient gravitational force this reduction must be compensated by changing v &quot;inverse proportional to the square root of the density&quot;. This follows from Fatio&#x27;s particle pressure, which is proportional to &quot;ρv&quot;2. According to Zehe, Fatio&#x27;s attempt to increase v to a very high value would actually leave the resistance very small compared with gravity, because the resistance in Fatio&#x27;s model is proportional to &quot;ρuv&quot; but gravity (i.e. the particle pressure) is proportional to &quot;ρv&quot;2.

=== Reception of Fatio&#x27;s theory ===
Fatio was in communication with some of the most famous scientists of his time.
There was a strong personal relationship between Isaac Newton and Fatio in the years 1690 to 1693. Newton&#x27;s statements on Fatio&#x27;s theory differed widely. For example, after describing the necessary conditions for a mechanical explanation of gravity, he wrote in an (unpublished) note in his own printed copy of the &quot;Principia&quot; in 1692:&quot;The unique hypothesis by which gravity can be explained is however of this kind, and was first devised by the most ingenious geometer Mr. N. Fatio.&quot; On the other hand, Fatio himself stated that although Newton had commented privately that Fatio&#x27;s theory was the best possible &quot;mechanical&quot; explanation of gravity, he also acknowledged that Newton tended to believe that the true explanation of gravitation was not mechanical. Also, Gregory noted in his &quot;Memoranda&quot;: &quot;Mr. Newton and Mr. Halley laugh at Mr. Fatio’s manner of explaining gravity.&quot; This was allegedly noted by him on December 28, 1691. However, the real date is unknown, because both ink and feather which were used, differ from the rest of the page. After 1694, the relationship between the two men cooled down.

Christiaan Huygens was the first person informed by Fatio of his theory, but never accepted it. Fatio believed he had convinced Huygens of the consistency of his theory, but Huygens denied this in a letter to Gottfried Leibniz. There was also a short correspondence between Fatio and Leibniz on the theory. Leibniz criticized Fatio&#x27;s theory for demanding empty space between the particles, which was rejected by him (Leibniz) on philosophical grounds. Jakob Bernoulli expressed an interest in Fatio&#x27;s Theory, and urged Fatio to write his thoughts on gravitation in a complete manuscript, which was actually done by Fatio. Bernoulli then copied the manuscript, which now resides in the university library of Basel, and was the base of the Bopp edition.

Nevertheless, Fatio&#x27;s theory remained largely unknown with a few exceptions like Cramer and Le Sage, because he never was able to formally publish his works and he fell under the influence of a group of religious fanatics called the &quot;French prophets&quot; (which belonged to the camisards) and therefore his public reputation was ruined.

== Cramer and Redeker ==
In 1731 the Swiss mathematician Gabriel Cramer published a dissertation, at the end of which appeared a sketch of a theory very similar to Fatio&#x27;s – including net structure of matter, analogy to light, shading – but without mentioning Fatio&#x27;s name. It was known to Fatio that Cramer had access to a copy of his main paper, so he accused Cramer of only repeating his theory without understanding it. It was also Cramer who informed Le Sage about Fatio&#x27;s theory in 1749. In 1736 the German physician Franz Albert Redeker also published a similar theory. Any connection between Redeker and Fatio is unknown.

== Le Sage ==

The first exposition of his theory, &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;origine des forces mortes&quot;, was sent by Le Sage to the Academy of Sciences at Paris in 1748, but it was never published. According to Le Sage, &quot;after&quot; creating and sending his essay he was informed on the theories of Fatio, Cramer and Redeker. In 1756 for the first time one of his expositions of the theory was published, and in 1758 he sent a more detailed exposition, &quot;Essai de Chymie Méchanique&quot;, to a competition to the Academy of Sciences in Rouen. In this paper he tried to explain both the nature of gravitation and chemical affinities. The exposition of the theory which became accessible to a broader public, &quot;Lucrèce Newtonien&quot; (1784), in which the correspondence with Lucretius’ concepts was fully developed. Another exposition of the theory was published from Le Sage&#x27;s notes posthumously by Pierre Prévost in 1818.
=== Le Sage&#x27;s basic concept ===

Le Sage discussed the theory in great detail and he proposed quantitative estimates for some of the theory&#x27;s parameters.
* He called the gravitational particles &quot;ultramundane corpuscles&quot;, because he supposed them to originate beyond our known universe. The distribution of the ultramundane flux is isotropic and the laws of its propagation are very similar to that of light.
* Le Sage argued that no gravitational force would arise if the matter-particle-collisions are perfectly elastic . So he proposed that the particles and the basic constituents of matter are &quot;absolutely hard&quot; and asserted that this implies a complicated form of interaction, completely inelastic in the direction normal to the surface of the ordinary matter, and perfectly elastic in the direction tangential to the surface. He then commented that this implies the mean speed of scattered particles is 2/3 of their incident speed. To avoid inelastic collisions between the particles, he supposed that their diameter is very small relative to their mutual distance.
* That resistance of the flux is proportional to &quot;uv&quot; (where &quot;v&quot; is the velocity of the particles and u that of gross matter) and gravity is proportional to &quot;v&quot;2, so the ratio resistance/gravity can be made arbitrarily small by increasing &quot;v&quot;. Therefore, he suggested that the ultramundane corpuscles might move at the speed of light, but after further consideration he adjusted this to 105 times the speed of light.
* To maintain mass proportionality, ordinary matter consists of cage-like structures, in which their diameter is only the 107th part of their mutual distance. Also the &quot;bars&quot;, which constitute the cages, were small (around 1020 times as long as thick) relative to the dimensions of the cages, so the particles can travel through them nearly unhindered.
* Le Sage also attempted to use the shadowing mechanism to account for the forces of cohesion, and for forces of different strengths, by positing the existence of multiple species of ultramundane corpuscles of different sizes, as illustrated in Figure 9.
Le Sage said that he was the first one, who drew all consequences from the theory and also Prévost said that Le Sage&#x27;s theory was more developed than Fatio&#x27;s theory. However, by comparing the two theories and after a detailed analysis of Fatio&#x27;s papers (which also were in possession of Le Sage) Zehe judged that Le Sage contributed nothing essentially new and he often did not reach Fatio&#x27;s level.

=== Reception of Le Sage&#x27;s theory ===
Le Sage&#x27;s ideas were not well-received during his day, except for some of his friends and associates like Pierre Prévost, Charles Bonnet, Jean-André Deluc, Charles Mahon, 3rd Earl Stanhope and Simon L&#x27;Huillier. They mentioned and described Le Sage&#x27;s theory in their books and papers, which were used by their contemporaries as a secondary source for Le Sage&#x27;s theory (because of the lack of published papers by Le Sage himself) .

==== Euler, Bernoulli, and Boscovich ====
Leonhard Euler once remarked that Le Sage&#x27;s model was &quot;infinitely better&quot; than that of all other authors, and that all objections are balanced out in this model, but later he said the analogy to light had no weight for him, because he believed in the wave nature of light. After further consideration, Euler came to disapprove of the model, and he wrote to Le Sage:

Daniel Bernoulli was pleased by the similarity of Le Sage&#x27;s model and his own thoughts on the nature of gases. However, Bernoulli himself was of the opinion that his own kinetic theory of gases was only a speculation, and likewise he regarded Le Sage&#x27;s theory as highly speculative.

Roger Joseph Boscovich pointed out, that Le Sage&#x27;s theory is the first one, which actually can explain gravity by mechanical means. However, he rejected the model because of the enormous and unused quantity of ultramundane matter. John Playfair described Boscovich&#x27;s arguments by saying:

A very similar argument was later given by Maxwell (see the sections below). Additionally, Boscovich denied the existence of all contact and immediate impulse at all, but proposed repulsive and attractive actions at a distance.

==== Lichtenberg, Kant, and Schelling ====
Georg Christoph Lichtenberg&#x27;s knowledge of Le Sage&#x27;s theory was based on &quot;Lucrece Newtonien&quot; and a summary by Prévost. Lichtenberg originally believed (like Descartes) that every explanation of natural phenomena must be based on rectilinear motion and impulsion, and Le Sage&#x27;s theory fulfilled these conditions. In 1790 he expressed in one of his papers his enthusiasm for the theory, believing that Le Sage&#x27;s theory embraces all of our knowledge and makes any further dreaming on that topic useless. He went on by saying: &quot;If it is a dream, it is the greatest and the most magnificent which was ever dreamed...&quot; and that we can fill with it a gap in our books, which can only be filled by a dream.

He often referred to Le Sage&#x27;s theory in his lectures on physics at the University of Göttingen. However, around 1796 Lichtenberg changed his views after being persuaded by the arguments of Immanuel Kant, who criticized any kind of theory that attempted to replace attraction with impulsion. Kant pointed out that the very existence of spatially extended configurations of matter, such as particles of non-zero radius, implies the existence of some sort of binding force to hold the extended parts of the particle together. Now, that force cannot be explained by the push from the gravitational particles, because those particles too must hold together in the same way. To avoid this circular reasoning, Kant asserted that there must exist a fundamental attractive force. This was precisely the same objection that had always been raised against the impulse doctrine of Descartes in the previous century, and had led even the followers of Descartes to abandon that aspect of his philosophy.

Another German philosopher, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, rejected Le Sage&#x27;s model because its mechanistic materialism was incompatible with Schelling&#x27;s very idealistic and anti-materialistic philosophy.

==== Laplace ====
Partly in consideration of Le Sage&#x27;s theory, Pierre-Simon Laplace undertook to determine the necessary speed of gravity in order to be consistent with astronomical observations. He calculated that the speed must be “at least a hundred millions of times greater than that of light”, in order to avoid unacceptably large inequalities due to aberration effects in the lunar motion. This was taken by most researchers, including Laplace, as support for the Newtonian concept of instantaneous action at a distance, and to indicate the implausibility of any model such as Le Sage&#x27;s. Laplace also argued that to maintain mass-proportionality the upper limit for Earth&#x27;s molecular surface area is at the most the ten-millionth of Earth&#x27;s surface. To Le Sage&#x27;s disappointment, Laplace never directly mentioned Le Sage&#x27;s theory in his works.

== Kinetic theory ==
Because the theories of Fatio, Cramer and Redeker were not widely known, Le Sage&#x27;s exposition of the theory enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the latter half of the 19th century, coinciding with the development of the kinetic theory of gases.

=== Leray ===
Since Le Sage&#x27;s particles must lose speed when colliding with ordinary matter (in order to produce a net gravitational force), a huge amount of energy must be converted to internal energy modes. If those particles have no internal energy modes, the excess energy can only be absorbed by ordinary matter. Addressing this problem, Armand Jean Leray proposed a particle model (perfectly similar to Le Sage&#x27;s) in which he asserted that the absorbed energy is used by the bodies to produce magnetism and heat. He suggested, that this might be an answer for the question of where the energy output of the stars comes from.

=== Kelvin and Tait ===

Le Sage&#x27;s &quot;own&quot; theory became a subject of renewed interest in the latter part of the 19th century following a paper published by Kelvin in 1873. Unlike Leray, who treated the heat problem imprecisely, Kelvin stated that the absorbed energy represents a very high heat, sufficient to vaporize any object in a fraction of a second. So Kelvin reiterated an idea that Fatio had originally proposed in the 1690s for attempting to deal with the thermodynamic problem inherent in Le Sage&#x27;s theory. He proposed that the excess heat might be absorbed by internal energy modes of the particles themselves, based on his proposal of the vortex-nature of matter. In other words, the original translational kinetic energy of the particles is transferred to internal energy modes, chiefly vibrational or rotational, of the particles. Appealing to Clausius&#x27;s proposition that the energy in any particular mode of a gas molecule tends toward a fixed ratio of the total energy, Kelvin went on to suggest that the &quot;energized&quot; but slower moving particles would subsequently be restored to their original condition due to collisions (on the cosmological scale) with other particles. Kelvin also asserted that it would be possible to extract limitless amounts of free energy from the ultramundane flux, and described a perpetual motion machine to accomplish this.

Subsequently, Peter Guthrie Tait called the Le Sage theory the only plausible explanation of gravitation which has been propounded at that time. He went on by saying:

Kelvin himself, however, was not optimistic that Le Sage&#x27;s theory could ultimately give a satisfactory account of phenomena. After his brief paper in 1873 noted above, he never returned to the subject, except to make the following comment:

=== Preston ===
Samuel Tolver Preston illustrated that many of the postulates introduced by Le Sage concerning the gravitational particles, such as rectilinear motion, rare interactions, &quot;etc.&quot;., could be collected under the single notion that they behaved (on the cosmological scale) as the particles of a gas with an extremely long mean free path. Preston also accepted Kelvin&#x27;s proposal of internal energy modes of the particles. He illustrated Kelvin&#x27;s model by comparing it with the collision of a steel ring and an anvil – the anvil would not be shaken very much, but the steel ring would be in a state of vibration and therefore departs with diminished velocity. He also argued, that the mean free path of the particles is at least the distance between the planets – on longer distances the particles regain their translational energy due collisions with each other, so he concluded that on longer distances there would be no attraction between the bodies, &quot;independent of their size&quot;. Paul Drude suggested that this could possibly be a connection with some theories of Carl Gottfried Neumann and Hugo von Seeliger, who proposed some sort of absorption of gravity in open space.

=== Maxwell ===

A review of the Kelvin-Le Sage theory was published by James Clerk Maxwell in the Ninth Edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; under the title &quot;Atom&quot; in 1875. After describing the basic concept of the theory he wrote (with sarcasm according to Aronson):

Maxwell commented on Kelvin&#x27;s suggestion of different energy modes of the particles that this implies the gravitational particles are not simple primitive entities, but rather systems, with their own internal energy modes, which must be held together by (unexplained) forces of attraction. He argues that the temperature of bodies must tend to approach that at which the average kinetic energy of a molecule of the body would be equal to the average kinetic energy of an ultra-mundane particle and he states that the latter quantity must be much greater than the former and concludes that ordinary matter should be incinerated within seconds under the Le Sage bombardment. He wrote:

Maxwell also argued that the theory requires &quot;an enormous expenditure of external power&quot; and therefore violating the conservation of energy as the fundamental principle of nature. Preston responded to Maxwell&#x27;s criticism by arguing that the kinetic energy of each individual simple particle could be made arbitrarily low by positing a sufficiently low mass (and higher number density) for the particles. But this issue later was discussed in a more detailed way by Poincaré, who showed that the thermodynamic problem within Le Sage models remained unresolved.

=== Isenkrahe, Ryšánek, du Bois-Reymond ===
Caspar Isenkrahe presented his model in a variety of publications between 1879 and 1915.

His basic assumptions were very similar to those of Le Sage and Preston, but he gave a more detailed application of the kinetic theory. However, by asserting that the velocity of the corpuscles after collision was reduced without any corresponding increase in the energy of any other object, his model violated the conservation of energy. He noted that there is a connection between the weight of a body and its density (because any decrease in the density of an object reduces the internal shielding) so he went on to assert that warm bodies should be heavier than colder ones (related to the effect of thermal expansion).

In another model Adalbert Ryšánek in 1887

also gave a careful analysis, including an application of Maxwell&#x27;s law of the particle velocities in a gas. He distinguished between a gravitational and a luminiferous aether. This separation of those two mediums was necessary, because according to his calculations the absence of any drag effect in the orbit of Neptune implies a lower limit for the particle velocity of 5 · 1019 cm/s. He (like Leray) argued that the absorbed energy is converted into heat, which might be transferred into the luminiferous aether and/or is used by the stars to maintain their energy output. However, these qualitative suggestions were unsupported by any quantitative evaluation of the amount of heat actually produced.

In 1888 Paul du Bois-Reymond argued against Le Sage&#x27;s model, partly because the predicted force of gravity in Le Sage&#x27;s theory is not strictly proportional to mass. In order to achieve exact mass proportionality as in Newton&#x27;s theory (which implies no shielding or saturation effects and an infinitely porous structure of matter), the ultramundane flux must be infinitely intense. Du Bois-Reymond rejected this as absurd. In addition, du Bois-Reymond like Kant observed that Le Sage&#x27;s theory cannot meet its goal, because it invokes concepts like &quot;elasticity&quot; and &quot;absolute hardness&quot; etc., which (in his opinion) can only be explained by means of attractive forces. The same problem arises for the cohesive forces in molecules. As a result, the basic intent of such models, which is to dispense with elementary forces of attraction, is impossible.

== Wave models ==
=== Keller and Boisbaudran ===
In 1863, François Antoine Edouard and Em. Keller presented a theory by using a Le Sage type mechanism in combination with longitudinal waves of the aether. They supposed that those waves are propagating in every direction and losing some of their momentum after the impact on bodies, so between two bodies the pressure exerted by the waves is weaker than the pressure around them. In 1869, Paul-Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran presented the same model as Leray (including absorption and the production of heat etc.), but like Keller and Keller, he replaced the particles with longitudinal waves of the aether.

=== Lorentz ===

After these attempts, other authors in the early 20th century substituted electromagnetic radiation for Le Sage&#x27;s particles. This was in connection with Lorentz ether theory and the electron theory of that time, in which the electrical constitution of matter was assumed.

In 1900 Hendrik Lorentz wrote that Le Sage&#x27;s particle model is not consistent with the electron theory of his time. But the realization that trains of electromagnetic waves could produce some pressure, in combination with the penetrating power of Röntgen rays (now called x-rays), led him to conclude that nothing argues against the possible existence of even more penetrating radiation than x-rays, which could replace Le Sage&#x27;s particles. Lorentz showed that an attractive force between charged particles (which might be taken to model the elementary subunits of matter) would indeed arise, but only if the incident energy were entirely absorbed. This was the same fundamental problem which had afflicted the particle models. So Lorentz wrote:

In 1922 Lorentz first examined Martin Knudsen&#x27;s investigation on rarefied gases and in connection with that he discussed Le Sage&#x27;s particle model, followed by a summary of his own electromagnetic Le Sage model – but he repeated his conclusion from 1900: Without absorption no gravitational effect.

In 1913 David Hilbert referred to Lorentz&#x27;s theory and criticised it by arguing that no force in the form 1/r2 can arise, if the mutual distance of the atoms is large enough when compared with their wavelength.

=== J.J. Thomson ===
In 1904 J. J. Thomson considered a Le Sage-type model in which the primary ultramundane flux consisted of a hypothetical form of radiation much more penetrating even than x-rays. He argued that Maxwell&#x27;s heat problem might be avoided by assuming that the absorbed energy is not converted into heat, but &quot;re-radiated&quot; in a still more penetrating form. He noted that this process possibly can explain where the energy of radioactive substances comes from – however, he stated that an internal cause of radioactivity is more probable. In 1911 Thomson went back to this subject in his article &quot;Matter&quot; in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition. There he stated, that this form of secondary radiation is somewhat analogous to how the passage of electrified particles through matter causes the radiation of the even more penetrating x-rays. He remarked:

=== Tommasina and Brush ===

Unlike Lorentz and Thomson, Thomas Tommasina between 1903 and 1928 suggested long wavelength radiation to explain gravity, and short wavelength radiation for explaining the cohesive forces of matter. Charles F. Brush in 1911 also proposed long wavelength radiation. But he later revised his view and changed to extremely short wavelengths.

== Later assessments ==
=== Darwin ===
In 1905, George Darwin subsequently calculated the gravitational force between two bodies at extremely close range to determine if geometrical effects would lead to a deviation from Newton&#x27;s law. Here Darwin replaced Le Sage&#x27;s cage-like units of ordinary matter with microscopic hard spheres of uniform size. He concluded that only in the instance of perfectly inelastic collisions (zero reflection) would Newton&#x27;s law stand up, thus reinforcing the thermodynamic problem of Le Sage&#x27;s theory. Also, such a theory is only valid if the normal &quot;and&quot; the tangential components of impact are totally inelastic (contrary to Le Sage&#x27;s scattering mechanism), and the elementary particles are exactly of the same size. He went on to say that the emission of light is the exact converse of the absorption of Le Sage&#x27;s particles. A body with different surface temperatures will move in the direction of the colder part. In a later review of gravitational theories, Darwin briefly described Le Sage&#x27;s theory and said he gave the theory serious consideration, but then wrote:

=== Poincaré ===

Partially based on the calculations of Darwin, an important criticism was given by Henri Poincaré in 1908. He concluded that the attraction is proportional to formula_1, where &quot;S&quot; is earth&#x27;s molecular surface area, &quot;v&quot; is the velocity of the particles, and ρ is the density of the medium. Following Laplace, he argued that to maintain mass-proportionality the upper limit for &quot;S&quot; is at the most a ten-millionth of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Now, drag (i.e. the resistance of the medium) is proportional to &quot;Sρv&quot; and therefore the ratio of drag to attraction is inversely proportional to &quot;Sv&quot;. To reduce drag, Poincaré calculated a lower limit for &quot;v&quot; = 24 · 1017 times the speed of light. So there are lower limits for &quot;Sv&quot; and v, and an upper limit for &quot;S&quot; and with those values one can calculate the produced heat, which is proportional to &quot;Sρv3&quot;. The calculation shows that earth&#x27;s temperature would rise by 1026 degrees per second. Poincaré noticed, &quot;that the earth could not long stand such a regime.&quot; Poincaré also analyzed some wave models (Tommasina and Lorentz), remarking that they suffered the same problems as the particle models. To reduce drag, superluminal wave velocities were necessary, and they would still be subject to the heating problem. After describing a similar re-radiation model like Thomson, he concluded: &quot;Such are the complicated hypotheses to which we are led when we seek to make Le Sage&#x27;s theory tenable&quot;.

He also stated that if in Lorentz&#x27; model the absorbed energy is fully converted into heat, that would raise earth&#x27;s temperature by 1013 degrees per second. Poincaré then went on to consider Le Sage&#x27;s theory in the context of the &quot;new dynamics&quot; that had been developed at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, specifically recognizing the relativity principle. For a particle theory, he remarked that &quot;it is difficult to imagine a law of collision compatible with the principle of relativity&quot;, and the problems of drag and heating remain.

== Predictions and criticism ==

=== Matter and particles ===
==== Porosity of matter ====
A basic prediction of the theory is the extreme porosity of matter. As supposed by Fatio and Le Sage in 1690/1758 (and before them, Huygens) matter must consist mostly of empty space so that the very small particles can penetrate the bodies nearly undisturbed and therefore every single part of matter can take part in the gravitational interaction. This prediction has been (in some respects) confirmed over the course of the time. Indeed, matter consists mostly of empty space and certain particles like neutrinos can pass through matter nearly unhindered. However, the image of elementary particles as classical entities who interact directly, determined by their shapes and sizes (in the sense of the net structure proposed by Fatio/Le Sage and the equisized spheres of Isenkrahe/Darwin), is not consistent with current understanding of elementary particles. The Lorentz/Thomson proposal of electrical charged particles as the &quot;basic constituents&quot; of matter is inconsistent with current physics as well.

==== Cosmic radiation ====
Every Le Sage-type model assumes the existence of a space-filling isotropic flux or radiation of enormous intensity and penetrating capability. This has some similarity to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) discovered in the 20th century. CMBR is indeed a space-filling and fairly isotropic flux, but its intensity is extremely small, as is its penetrating capability. The flux of neutrinos, emanating from (for example) the sun, possesses the penetrating properties envisaged by Le Sage for his ultramundane corpuscles, but this flux is not isotropic (since individual stars are the main sources of neutrinos) and the intensity is even less than that of the CMBR. Of course, neither the CMBR nor neutrinos propagate at superluminal speeds, which is another necessary attribute of Le Sage&#x27;s particles. From a more modern point of view, discarding the simple “push” concept of Le Sage, the suggestion that the neutrino (or some other particle similar to the neutrino) might be the mediating particle in a quantum field theory of gravitation was considered and disproved by Feynman.

=== Gravitational shielding ===

Although matter is postulated to be very sparse in the Fatio–Le Sage theory, it cannot be perfectly transparent, because in that case no gravitational force would exist. However, the lack of perfect transparency leads to problems: with sufficient mass the amount of shading produced by two pieces of matter becomes less than the sum of the shading that each of them would produce separately, due to the overlap of their shadows (P10, above). This hypothetical effect, called gravitational shielding, implies that addition of matter does not result in a direct proportional increase in the gravitational mass. Therefore, in order to be viable, Fatio and Le Sage postulated that the shielding effect is so small as to be undetectable, which requires that the interaction cross-section of matter must be extremely small (P10, below). This places an extremely high lower-bound on the intensity of the flux required to produce the observed force of gravity. Any form of gravitational shielding would represent a violation of the equivalence principle, and would be inconsistent with the extremely precise null result observed in the Eötvös experiment and its successors all of which have instead confirmed the precise equivalence of active and passive gravitational mass with inertial mass that was predicted by general relativity. For more historical information on the connection between gravitational shielding and Le Sage gravity, see Martins, and Borzeszkowski et al.

Since Isenkrahe&#x27;s proposal on the connection between density, temperature and weight was based purely on the anticipated effects of changes in material &quot;density&quot;, and since temperature at a given density can be increased or decreased, Isenkrahe&#x27;s comments do not imply any fundamental relation between temperature and gravitation. (There actually &quot;is&quot; a relation between temperature and gravitation, as well as between binding energy and gravitation, but these actual effects have nothing to do with Isenkrahe&#x27;s proposal. See the section below on &quot;Coupling to energy&quot;.) Regarding the prediction of a relation between gravitation and density, all experimental evidence indicates that there is no such relation.

=== Speed of gravity ===
==== Drag ====
According to Le Sage&#x27;s theory, an isolated body is subjected to drag if it is in motion relative to the unique isotropic frame of the ultramundane flux (i.e., the frame in which the speed of the ultramundane corpuscles is the same in all directions). This is due to the fact that, if a body is in motion, the particles striking the body from the front have a higher speed (relative to the body) than those striking the body from behind – this effect will act to &quot;decrease&quot; the distance between the sun and the earth. The magnitude of this drag is proportional to &quot;vu&quot;, where &quot;v&quot; is the speed of the particles and u is the speed of the body, whereas the characteristic force of gravity is proportional to &quot;v&quot;2, so the ratio of drag to gravitational force is proportional to &quot;u&quot;/&quot;v&quot;. Thus for a given characteristic strength of gravity, the amount of drag for a given speed u can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the speed &quot;v&quot; of the ultramundane corpuscles. However, in order to reduce the drag to an acceptable level (i.e., consistent with observation) in terms of classical mechanics, the speed &quot;v&quot; must be many orders of magnitude greater than the speed of light. This makes Le Sage theory fundamentally incompatible with the modern science of mechanics based on special relativity, according to which no particle (or wave) can exceed the speed of light. In addition, even if superluminal particles were possible, the effective temperature of such a flux would be sufficient to incinerate all ordinary matter in a fraction of a second.

==== Aberration ====
As shown by Laplace, another possible Le Sage effect is orbital aberration due to finite speed of gravity. Unless the Le Sage particles are moving at speeds much greater than the speed of light, as Le Sage and Kelvin supposed, there is a time delay in the interactions between bodies (the transit time). In the case of orbital motion this results in each body reacting to a retarded position of the other, which creates a leading force component. Contrary to the drag effect, this component will act to accelerate both objects away from each other. In order to maintain stable orbits, the effect of gravity must either propagate much faster than the speed of light or must not be a purely central force. This has been suggested by many as a conclusive disproof of any Le Sage type of theory. In contrast, general relativity is consistent with the lack of appreciable aberration identified by Laplace, because even though gravity propagates at the speed of light in general relativity, the expected aberration is almost exactly cancelled by velocity-dependent terms in the interaction.

=== Range of gravity ===
In many particle models, such as Kelvin&#x27;s, the range of gravity is limited due to the nature of particle interactions amongst themselves. The range is effectively determined by the rate that the proposed &quot;internal modes&quot; of the particles can eliminate the momentum defects (&quot;shadows&quot;) that are created by passing through matter. Such predictions as to the effective range of gravity will vary and are dependent upon the specific aspects and assumptions as to the modes of interactions that are available during particle interactions. However, for this class of models the observed large-scale structure of the cosmos constrains such dispersion to those that will allow for the aggregation of such immense gravitational structures.

=== Energy ===
==== Absorption ====
As noted in the historical section, a major problem for every Le Sage model is the energy and heat issue. As Maxwell and Poincaré showed, inelastic collisions lead to a vaporization of matter within fractions of a second and the suggested solutions were not convincing. For example, Aronson gave a simple proof of Maxwell&#x27;s assertion:

Likewise Isenkrahe&#x27;s violation of the energy conservation law is unacceptable, and Kelvin&#x27;s application of Clausius&#x27; theorem leads (as noted by Kelvin himself) to some sort of perpetual motion mechanism. The suggestion of a secondary re-radiation mechanism for wave models attracted the interest of JJ Thomson, but was not taken very seriously by either Maxwell or Poincaré, because it entails a gross violation of the second law of thermodynamics (huge amounts of energy spontaneously being converted from a colder to a hotter form), which is one of the most solidly established of all physical laws.

The energy problem has also been considered in relation to the idea of mass accretion in connection with the Expanding Earth theory. Among the early theorists to link mass increase in some sort of push gravity model to Earth expansion were Yarkovsky and Hilgenberg. The idea of mass accretion and the expanding earth theory are not currently considered to be viable by mainstream scientists. This is because, among other reasons, according to the principle of mass–energy equivalence, if the Earth was absorbing the energy of the ultramundane flux at the rate necessary to produce the observed force of gravity (i.e. by using the values calculated by Poincaré), its mass would be doubling in each fraction of a second.

==== Coupling to energy ====
Based on observational evidence, it is now known that gravity interacts with all forms of energy, and not just with mass. The electrostatic binding energy of the nucleus, the energy of weak interactions in the nucleus, and the kinetic energy of electrons in atoms, all contribute to the gravitational mass of an atom, as has been confirmed to high precision in Eötvös type experiments.
This means, for example, that when the atoms of a quantity of gas are moving more rapidly, the gravitation of that gas increases. Moreover, Lunar Laser Ranging experiments have shown that even gravitational binding energy itself also gravitates, with a strength consistent with the equivalence principle to high precision which furthermore demonstrates that any successful theory of gravitation must be nonlinear and self-coupling.

Le Sage&#x27;s theory does not predict any of these aforementioned effects, nor do any of the known variants of Le Sage&#x27;s theory.

== Non-gravitational applications and analogies ==
=== Mock gravity ===
Lyman Spitzer in 1941 calculated, that absorption of radiation between two dust particles lead to a net attractive force which varies proportional to 1/&quot;r&quot;2 (evidently he was unaware of Le Sage&#x27;s shadow mechanism and especially Lorentz&#x27;s considerations on radiation pressure and gravity). George Gamow, who called this effect &quot;mock gravity&quot;, proposed in 1949 that after the Big Bang the temperature of electrons dropped faster than the temperature of background radiation. Absorption of radiation lead to a Lesage mechanism between electrons, which might have had an important role in the process of galaxy formation shortly after the Big Bang. However, this proposal was disproved by Field in 1971, who showed that this effect was much too small, because electrons and background radiation were nearly in thermal equilibrium. Hogan and White proposed in 1986 that mock gravity might have influenced the formation of galaxies by absorption of pregalactic starlight. But it was shown by Wang and Field that any form of mock gravity is incapable of producing enough force to influence galaxy formation.

=== Plasma ===
The Le Sage mechanism also has been identified as a significant factor in the behavior of dusty plasma. A.M. Ignatov has shown that an attractive force arises between two dust grains suspended in an isotropic collisionless plasma due to inelastic collisions between ions of the plasma and the grains of dust. This attractive force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between dust grains, and can counterbalance the Coulomb repulsion between dust grains.

=== Vacuum energy ===
In quantum field theory the existence of virtual particles is proposed, which lead to the so-called Casimir effect. Casimir calculated that between two plates only particles with specific wavelengths should be counted when calculating the vacuum energy. Therefore, the energy density between the plates is less if the plates are close together, leading to a net attractive force between the plates. However, the conceptual framework of this effect is very different from the theory of Fatio and Le Sage.

== Recent activity ==
The re-examination of Le Sage&#x27;s theory in the 19th century identified several closely interconnected problems with the theory. These relate to excessive heating, frictional drag, shielding, and gravitational aberration. The recognition of these problems, in conjunction with a general shift away from mechanical based theories, resulted in a progressive loss of interest in Le Sage&#x27;s theory. Ultimately in the 20th century Le Sage&#x27;s theory was eclipsed by Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity.

In 1965 Richard Feynman examined the Fatio/Lesage mechanism, primarily as an example of an attempt to explain a &quot;complicated&quot; physical law (in this case, Newton&#x27;s inverse-square law of gravity) in terms of simpler primitive operations without the use of complex mathematics, and also as an example of a failed theory. He notes that the mechanism of &quot;bouncing particles&quot; reproduces the inverse-square force law and that &quot;the strangeness of the mathematical relation will be very much reduced&quot;, but then remarks that the scheme &quot;does not work&quot;, because of the drag it predicts would be experienced by moving bodies.

There are occasional attempts to re-habilitate the theory outside the mainstream, including those of Radzievskii and Kagalnikova (1960), Shneiderov (1961), Buonomano and Engels (1976), Adamut (1982), Popescu (1982), Jaakkola (1996), Tom Van Flandern (1999), and Edwards (2014).

A variety of Le Sage models and related topics are discussed in Edwards, et al.

<text>A pusher, pusher craft, pusher boat, pusher tug, or towboat, is a boat designed for pushing barges or car floats. In the United States, the industries that use these vessels refer to them as towboats. These vessels are characterized by a square bow and a shallow draft, and they typically have knees, which are large plates mounted to the bow for pushing barges of various heights. These boats usually operate on rivers and inland waterways. Multiple barges lashed together, or a boat and any barges lashed to it, are referred to as a &quot;tow&quot; and can have dozens of barges. Many of these vessels, especially the long-haul boats, include living quarters for the crew.

==Size==
Towboat engine outputs range from less than up to . Most towboats are from long, and wide. Smaller boats are used in harbors, fleeting areas and around locks while larger boats operate in &quot;line-haul&quot; operations over long distances and between major ports. In the United States, south of the Chain of Rocks Lock across from St. Louis on the Mississippi River, the river is open with no locks or impediments other than channel size and depth. Larger boats can run this segment of the river with the maximum tow size of 42 barges southbound and 40+ northbound. A typical River tow might be 35 to 42 barges, each about long by wide, configured in a rectangular shape 6 to 7 barges long and 5 to 6 barges wide, depending on the number of barges in tow. The whole tow, excluding the towboat, can easily be over long and wide, covering over and holding thousands of tons of cargo.

In the United States above St. Louis on the Upper Mississippi River and on other rivers such as the Illinois, Ohio, Arkansas, Tennessee and Cumberland, boats can handle only up to 16 barges including a &quot;hip&quot; barge due to the size of lock chambers. These boats tend to be limited to .

Towboats in line-haul service operate 24/7 and have the latest in navigational equipment, such as color radar, GPS systems, electronic river charts, and specialized radio communications.
Boats that traverse the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) are commonly referred to as &quot;ditch boats&quot; or &quot;canal boats&quot;. ICW tows usually consist of 1 to 6 barges ranging in size, usually &quot;strung out&quot; end to end when loaded or &quot;breasted up&quot; side by side when empty.

Towboats always push the &quot;tow&quot; of barges, which are lashed together with steel cables usually in diameter. 

==History==

The term towboat arises from steamboat days, when steamboat fortunes began to decline and to survive, steamboats began to &quot;tow&quot; wooden barges alongside to earn additional revenue. Eventually, the railroad expansion following the American Civil War ended the steamboat era.

During the 19th century, towboats were used to push showboats, which lacked steam engines to free up space for a theater.

==Preserved towboats==
The Binnenvaartmuseum (&#x27;Inland Shipping Museum&#x27;) in Dordrecht, South Holland, Netherlands is centered around &quot;René Siegfried&quot;, a River Rhine pusher boat which was built in 1963 and decommissioned in 1989.

The &quot;W. P. Snyder Jr.&quot;, also known as W. H. Clingerman, W. P. Snyder Jr. State Memorial, or J. L. Perry, is a historic towboat moored on the Muskingum River in Marietta, Ohio, at the Ohio River Museum. A National Historic Landmark, she is the only intact steam-driven sternwheel towboat still on the United States river system.

<text>A weir or low-head dam is a barrier across the width of a river that alters the flow characteristics of water and usually results in a change in the height of the river level. Weirs are also used to control the flow of water for outlets of lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. There are many weir designs, but commonly water flows freely over the top of the weir crest before cascading down to a lower level. There is no single definition as to what constitutes a weir. 

&quot;Weir&quot; can also refer to the skimmer found in most in-ground swimming pools, which controls the flow of water pulled into the filtering system.

==Etymology==
The word likely originated from Middle English &quot;were&quot;, Old English &quot;wer&quot;, a derivative of the root of the verb &quot;werian,&quot; meaning &quot;to defend, dam&quot;. The German cognate is &quot;Wehr&quot;, which means the same as English weir.

==Function==
Commonly, weirs are used to prevent flooding, measure water discharge, and help render rivers more navigable by boat. In some locations, the terms dam and weir are synonymous, but normally there is a clear distinction made between the structures. Usually, a dam is designed specifically to impound water behind a wall, whilst a weir is designed to alter the river flow characteristics.

A common distinction between dams and weirs is that water flows over the top (crest) of a weir or underneath it for at least some of its length. Accordingly, the crest of an overflow spillway on a large dam may therefore be referred to as a weir. Weirs can vary in size both horizontally and vertically, with the smallest being only a few centimetres in height whilst the largest may be many metres tall and hundreds of metres long. Some common weir purposes are outlined below.

===Flow measurement===
Weirs allow hydrologists and engineers a simple method of measuring the volumetric flow rate in small to medium-sized streams/rivers or in industrial discharge locations. Since the geometry of the top of the weir is known and all water flows over the weir, the depth of water behind the weir can be converted to a rate of flow. However, this can only be achieved in locations where all water flows over the top of the weir crest (as opposed to around the sides or through conduits or sluices) and at locations where the water that flows over the crest is carried away from the structure. If these conditions are not met, it can make flow measurement complicated, inaccurate, or even impossible.

The discharge calculation can be summarised as

where
: is the volumetric flow rate of fluid (the discharge),
: is the flow coefficient for the structure (on average a figure of 3.33),
: is the width of the crest,
: is the height of head of water over the crest,
: varies with structure (e.g., for horizontal weir, for V-notch weir).

However, this calculation is a generic relationship and specific calculations are available for the many different types of weir. Flow measurement weirs must be well maintained if they are to remain accurate.

===Flow over a V-notch weir===
The flow over a V-notch weir (in ft3/s) is given by the Kindsvater–Shen equation:
: formula_1

where
: &quot;Q&quot; is the volumetric flow rate of fluid in ft3/s,
: &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration due to gravity in ft/s2,
: &quot;Ce&quot; is the flow correction factor given in ,
: &quot;θ&quot; is the angle of the V-notch weir,
: &quot;h&quot; is the height of the fluid above the bottom of the V-notch,
: &quot;k&quot; is the head correction factor given in .

===Control of invasive species===
As weirs are a physical barrier, they can impede the longitudinal movement of fish and other animals up and down a river. This can have a negative effect on fish species that migrate as part of their breeding cycle (e.g., salmonids), but it also can be useful as a method of preventing invasive species moving upstream. For example, weirs in the Great Lakes region have helped to prevent invasive sea lamprey from colonising farther upstream.

===Watermills===
Mill ponds are created by a weir that impounds water that then flows over the structure. The energy created by the change in height of the water can then be used to power waterwheels and power sawmills, grinding wheels, and other equipment.

===Flood control and altering river conditions===
Weirs are commonly used to control the flow rates of rivers during periods of high discharge. Sluice gates (or in some cases the height of the weir crest) can be altered to increase or decrease the volume of water flowing downstream. Weirs for this purpose are commonly found upstream of towns and villages and can either be automated or manually operated. By slowing the rate at which water moves downstream even slightly, a disproportionate effect can be had on the likelihood of flooding. On larger rivers, a weir can also alter the flow characteristics of the waterway to the point that vessels are able to navigate areas previously inaccessible due to extreme currents or eddies. Many larger weirs will have construction features that allow boats and river users to &quot;shoot the weir&quot; and navigate by passing up or down stream without having to exit the river. Weirs constructed for this purpose are especially common on the River Thames, and most are situated near each of the river&#x27;s 45 locks.

==Issues==
===Ecology===
Because a weir impounds water behind it and alters the flow regime of the river, it can have an effect on the local ecology. Typically, the reduced river velocity upstream can lead to increased siltation (deposition of fine particles of silt and clay on the river bottom) that reduces the water oxygen content and smothers invertebrate habitat and fish spawning sites. The oxygen content typically returns to normal once water has passed over the weir crest (although it can be hyper-oxygenated), although increased river velocity can scour the river bed causing erosion and habitat loss.

===Fish migration===
Weirs can have a significant effect on fish migration. Any weir that exceeds either the maximum height a species can jump or creates flow conditions that cannot be bypassed (e.g., due to excessive water velocity) effectively limits the maximum point upstream that fish can migrate. In some cases this can mean that huge lengths of breeding habitat are lost, and over time this can have a significant impact on fish populations.

In many countries, it is now a legal requirement to build fish ladders into the design of a weir that ensure that fish can bypass the barriers and access upstream habitats. Unlike dams, weirs do not usually prevent downstream fish migration (as water flows over the top and allows fish to bypass the structure in that water), although they can create flow conditions that injure juvenile fish. Recent studies suggest that navigation locks have also potential to provide increased access for a range of biota, including poor swimmers.

===Safety===

Even though the water around weirs can often appear relatively calm, they can be extremely dangerous places to boat, swim, or wade, as the circulation patterns on the downstream side—typically called a hydraulic jump—can submerge a person indefinitely. This phenomenon is so well known to canoeists, kayakers, and others who spend time on rivers that they even have a rueful name for weirs: &quot;drowning machines&quot;. The Ohio DNR recommends that a victim should &quot;tuck the chin down, draw the knees up to the chest with arms wrapped around them. Hopefully, conditions will be such that the current will push the victim along the bed of the river until swept beyond the boil line and released by the hydraulic.&quot; The Pennsylvania State Police also recommends to victims, &quot;curl up, dive to the bottom, and swim or crawl downstream&quot;. As the hydraulic jump entrains air, the buoyancy of the water between the dam and boil line will be reduced by upward of 30%, and if a victim is unable to float, escape at the base of the dam may be the only option for survival.

==Common types==
There are many different types of weirs and they can vary from a simple stone structure that is barely noticeable, to elaborate and very large structures that require extensive management and maintenance.

===Broad-crested===
A broad-crested weir is a flat-crested structure, where the water passes over a crest that covers much or all of the channel width. This is one of the most common types of weir found worldwide.

===Compound===
A compound weir is any weir that comprises several different designs into one structure. They are commonly seen in locations where a river has multiple users who may need to bypass the structure. A common design would be one where a weir is broad-crested for much of its length, but has a section where the weir stops or is &#x27;open&#x27; so that small boats and fish can traverse the structure.

===V-notch===
A notch weir is any weir where the physical barrier is significantly higher than the water level except for a specific notch (often V-shaped) cut into the panel. At times of normal flow all the water must pass through the notch, simplifying flow volume calculations, and at times of flood the water level can rise and submerge the weir without any alterations made to the structure.

===Polynomial===
A polynomial weir is a weir that has a geometry defined by a polynomial equation of any order &quot;n&quot;. In practice, most weirs are low-order polynomial weirs. The standard rectangular weir is, for example, a polynomial weir of order zero. The triangular (V-notch) and trapezoidal weirs are of order one. High-order polynomial weirs are providing wider range of Head-Discharge relationships, and hence better control of the flow at outlets of lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.

<doc id="307267" wikidata="Q115483" url="?curid=307267" title="Max Frisch">
<text>Max Rudolf Frisch (; 15 May 1911 – 4 April 1991) was a Swiss playwright and novelist. Frisch&#x27;s works focused on problems of identity, individuality, responsibility, morality, and political commitment. The use of irony is a significant feature of his post-war output. Frisch was one of the founders of Gruppe Olten. He was awarded the 1965 Jerusalem Prize, the 1973 Grand Schiller Prize, and the 1986 Neustadt International Prize for Literature.

== Early years and education ==
Max Rudolf Frisch was born on 15 May 1911 in Zurich, Switzerland, the second son of Franz Bruno Frisch, an architect, and Karolina Bettina Frisch (née Wildermuth). He had a sister, Emma (1899–1972), his father&#x27;s daughter by a previous marriage, and a brother, Franz, eight years his senior (1903–1978). The family lived modestly, their financial situation deteriorating after the father lost his job during the First World War. Frisch had an emotionally distant relationship with his father, but was close to his mother. While at secondary school Frisch started to write drama, but failed to get his work performed and he subsequently destroyed his first literary works. While he was at school he met Werner Coninx (1911–1980), who later became a successful artist and collector. The two men formed a lifelong friendship. 

In the 1930/31 academic year Frisch enrolled at the University of Zurich to study German literature and linguistics. There he met professors who gave him contact with the worlds of publishing and journalism, and was influenced by Robert Faesi (1883–1972) and Theophil Spoerri (1890–1974), both writers and professors at the university. Frisch had hoped the university would provide him with the practical underpinnings for a career as a writer, but became convinced that university studies would not provide this. In 1932, when financial pressures on the family intensified, Frisch abandoned his studies. In 1936 Max Frisch studied architecture at the ETH Zurich and graduated in 1940. In 1942 he set up his own architecture business.

==Career ==
=== Journalism ===
Frisch made his first contribution to the newspaper &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot; (NZZ) in May 1931, but the death of his father in March 1932 persuaded him to make a full-time career of journalism in order to generate an income to support his mother. He developed a lifelong ambivalent relationship with the NZZ; his later radicalism was in stark contrast to the conservative views of the newspaper. The move to the NZZ is the subject of his April 1932 essay, titled &quot;Was bin ich?&quot; (&quot;What am I?&quot;), his first serious piece of freelance work. Until 1934 Frisch combined journalistic work with coursework at the university. Over 100 of his pieces survive from this period; they are autobiographical, rather than political, dealing with his own self-exploration and personal experiences, such as the break-up of his love affair with the 18-year-old actress Else Schebesta. Few of these early works made it into the published compilations of Frisch&#x27;s writings that appeared after he had become better known. Frisch seems to have found many of them excessively introspective even at the time, and tried to distract himself by taking labouring jobs involving physical exertion, including a period in 1932 when he worked on road construction.

=== First novel ===
Between February and October 1933 he travelled extensively through eastern and southeastern Europe, financing his expeditions with reports written for newspapers and magazines. One of his first contributions was a report on the Prague World Ice Hockey Championship (1933) for the &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot;. Other destinations were Budapest, Belgrade, Sarajevo, Dubrovnik, Zagreb, Istanbul, Athens, Bari, and Rome. Another product of this extensive tour was Frisch&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Jürg Reinhart&quot;, which appeared in 1934. In it Reinhart represents the author, undertaking a trip through the Balkans as a way to find purpose in life. In the end the eponymous hero concludes that he can only become fully adult by performing a &quot;manly act&quot;. He does so by helping his landlady&#x27;s daughter, who is terminally ill, end her life painlessly.

=== Käte Rubensohn and Germany ===
In the summer of 1934, Frisch met Käte Rubensohn, who was three years his junior. The next year the two developed a romantic liaison. Rubensohn, who was Jewish, had emigrated from Berlin to continue her studies, which had been interrupted by government-led antisemitism and race-based legislation in Germany. In 1935 Frisch visited Germany for the first time. He kept a diary, later published as &quot;Kleines Tagebuch einer deutschen Reise&quot; (&quot;Short Diary of a German Trip&quot;), in which he described and criticised the antisemitism he encountered. At the same time, Frisch recorded his admiration for the &quot;Wunder des Lebens&quot; (&quot;Wonder of Life&quot;) exhibition staged by Herbert Bayer, an admirer of the Hitler government&#x27;s philosophy and policies. (Bayer was later forced to flee the country after annoying Hitler). Frisch failed to anticipate how Germany&#x27;s National Socialism would evolve, and his early apolitical novels were published by the Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt (DVA) without encountering any difficulties from the German censors. During the 1940s Frisch developed a more critical political consciousness. His failure to become more critical sooner has been attributed in part to the conservative spirit at the University of Zurich, where several professors were openly sympathetic with Hitler and Mussolini. Frisch was never tempted to embrace such sympathies, as he explained much later, because of his relationship with Käte Rubensohn, even though the romance itself ended in 1939 after she refused to marry him.

=== Architecture ===
Frisch&#x27;s second novel, &quot;An Answer from the Silence&quot; (&quot;Antwort aus der Stille&quot;), appeared in 1937. The book returned to the theme of a &quot;manly act&quot;, but now placed it in the context of a middle class lifestyle. The author quickly became critical of the book, burning the original manuscript in 1937 and refusing to let it be included in a compilation of his works published in the 1970s. Frisch had the word &quot;author&quot; deleted from the &quot;profession/occupation&quot; field in his passport. Supported by a stipend from his friend Werner Coninx, he had in 1936 enrolled at the ETH Zurich () to study architecture, his father&#x27;s profession. His resolve to disown his second published novel was undermined when it won him the 1938 Conrad Ferdinand Meyer Prize, which included an award of 3,000 Swiss francs. At this time Frisch was living on an annual stipend from his friend of 4,000 francs.

With the outbreak of war in 1939, he joined the Swiss army as a gunner. Although Swiss neutrality meant that army membership was not a full-time occupation, the country mobilised to be ready to resist a German invasion, and by 1945 Frisch had clocked up 650 days of active service. He also returned to writing. 1939 saw the publication of &quot;From a Soldier&#x27;s Diary&quot; (&quot;Aus dem Tagebuch eines Soldaten&quot;), which initially appeared in the monthly journal, &quot;Atlantis&quot;. In 1940 the same writings were compiled into the book &quot;Pages from the Bread-bag&quot; (&quot;Blätter aus dem Brotsack&quot;). The book was broadly uncritical of Swiss military life, and of Switzerland&#x27;s position in war-time Europe, attitudes that Frisch revisited and revised in his 1974 &quot;Little Service Book&quot; (&quot;Dienstbuechlein&quot;); by 1974 he felt strongly that his country had been too ready to accommodate the interests of Nazi Germany during the war years.

At the ETH, Frisch studied architecture with William Dunkel, whose pupils also included Justus Dahinden and Alberto Camenzind, later stars of Swiss architecture. After receiving his diploma in the summer of 1940, Frisch accepted an offer of a permanent position in Dunkel&#x27;s architecture studio, and for the first time in his life was able to afford a home of his own. 

While working for Dunkel he met another architect, Gertrud Frisch-von Meyenburg, and on 30 July 1942 the two were married. The marriage produced three children: Ursula (1943), Hans Peter (1944), and Charlotte (1949). Much later, in a book of her own, &quot;Sturz durch alle Spiegel&quot; (Fall through all the mirrors), which appeared in 2009, his daughter Ursula reflected on her difficult relationship with her father.
In 1943 Frisch was selected from among 65 applicants to design the new Letzigraben (subsequently renamed &quot;Max-Frisch-Bad&quot;) swimming pool in the Zurich district of Albisrieden. Because of this substantial commission he was able to open his own architecture studio, with a couple of employees. Wartime materials shortages meant that construction had to be deferred until 1947, but the public swimming pool was opened in 1949. It is now protected under historic monument legislation. From 2006 to 2007, it underwent an extensive renovation which returned it to its original condition.

Overall Frisch designed more than a dozen buildings, although only two were actually built. One was a house for his brother Franz and the other was a country house for the shampoo magnate, K. F. Ferster. Ferster&#x27;s house triggered a major court action when it was alleged that Frisch had altered the dimensions of the main staircase without reference to his client. Frisch later retaliated by using Ferster as the model for the protagonist in his play &quot;The Fire Raisers&quot; (&quot;Biedermann und die Brandstifter&quot;). When Frisch was managing his own architecture studio, he was generally found in his office only during the mornings. Much of his time and energy was devoted to writing.

=== Theatre ===

Frisch was already a regular visitor at the Zürich Playhouse (&quot;Schauspielhaus&quot;) while still a student. Drama in Zürich was experiencing a golden age at this time, thanks to the flood of theatrical talent in exile from Germany and Austria. From 1944 the Playhouse director Kurt Hirschfeld encouraged Frisch to work for the theatre, and backed him when he did so. In &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;, his first play, written in 1944 and first performed in 1946, Frisch, who had himself been married since 1942, addressed the question of how the dreams and yearnings of the individual could be reconciled with married life. In his 1944 novel &quot;J&#x27;adore ce qui me brûle&quot; (&quot;I adore that which burns me&quot;) he had already placed emphasis on the incompatibility between the artistic life and respectable middle class existence. The novel reintroduces as its protagonist the artist Jürg Reinhart, familiar to readers of Frisch&#x27;s first novel, and in many respects a representation of the author himself. It deals with a love affair that ends badly. This same tension is at the centre of a subsequent narrative by Frisch published, initially, by Atlantis in 1945 and titled &quot;Bin oder Die Reise nach Peking&quot; (&quot;Bin or the Journey to Beijing&quot;).
Both of his next two works for the theatre reflect the Second World War. &quot;Now they sing again&quot; (&quot;Nun singen sie wieder&quot;), though written in 1945, was actually performed ahead of his first play &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;. It addresses the question of the personal guilt of soldiers who obey inhuman orders, and treats the matter in terms of the subjective perspectives of those involved. The piece, which avoids simplistic judgements, played to audiences not just in Zürich but also in German theatres during the 1946/47 season. The NZZ, then as now his native city&#x27;s powerfully influential newspaper, pilloried the piece on its front page, claiming that it &quot;embroidered&quot; the horrors of National Socialism, and they refused to print Frisch&#x27;s rebuttal. &quot;The Chinese Wall&quot; (&quot;Die Chinesische Mauer&quot;) which appeared in 1946, explores the possibility that humanity might itself be eradicated by the (then recently invented) atomic bomb. The piece unleashed public discussion of the issues involved, and can today be compared with Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s &quot;The Physicists&quot; (1962) and Heinar Kipphardt&#x27;s &quot;On the J Robert Oppenheimer Affair&quot; (&quot;In der Sache J. Robert Oppenheimer&quot;), though these pieces are all now for the most part forgotten.

Working with the theatre director Hirschfeld enabled Frisch to meet some leading fellow playwrights who would influence his later work. He met the exiled German writer, Carl Zuckmayer, in 1946, and the young Friedrich Dürrenmatt in 1947. Despite artistic differences on self-awareness issues, Dürrenmatt and Frisch became lifelong friends. 1947 was also the year in which Frisch met Bertolt Brecht, already established as a doyen of German theatre and of the political left. An admirer of Brecht&#x27;s work, Frisch now embarked on regular exchanges with the older dramatist on matters of shared artistic interest. Brecht encouraged Frisch to write more plays, while placing emphasis on social responsibility in artistic work. Although Brecht&#x27;s influence is evident in some of Frisch&#x27;s theoretical views and can be seen in one or two of his more practical works, the Swiss writer could never have been numbered among Brecht&#x27;s followers. He kept his independent position, by now increasingly marked by scepticism in respect of the polarized political grandstanding which in Europe was a feature of the early Cold War years. This is particularly apparent in his 1948 play &quot;As the war ended&quot; (&quot;Als der Krieg zu Ende war&quot;), based on eye-witness accounts of the Red Army as an occupying force.

=== Travels in post-war Europe ===
In April 1946 Frisch and Hirschfeld visited post-war Germany together.

In August 1948 Frisch visited Breslau (Wrocław) to attend an International Peace Congress organized by Jerzy Borejsza. Breslau itself, which had been more than 90% German speaking as recently as 1945, was an instructive microcosm of the post-war settlement in central Europe. Poland&#x27;s western frontier had moved, and the ethnically German majority in Breslau had escaped or been expelled from the city which now adopted its Polish name as Wrocław. The absented ethnic Germans were being replaced by relocated Polish speakers whose own formerly Polish homes were now included within the newly enlarged Soviet Union. A large number of European intellectuals were invited to the Peace Congress which was presented as part of a wider political reconciliation exercise between east and west. Frisch was not alone in quickly deciding that the congress hosts were simply using the event as an elaborate propaganda exercise, and there was hardly any opportunity for the &quot;international participants&quot; to discuss anything. Frisch left before the event ended and headed for Warsaw, notebook in hand, to collect and record his own impressions of what was happening. Nevertheless, when he returned home the resolutely conservative NZZ concluded that by visiting Poland Frisch had simply confirmed his status as a Communist sympathizer, and not for the first time refused to print his rebuttal of their simplistic conclusions. Frisch now served notice on his old newspaper that their collaboration was at an end.

=== Success as a novelist ===

By 1947 Frisch had accumulated roughly 130 filled notebooks, and these were published in a compilation titled &quot;Tagebuch mit Marion&quot; (&quot;Diary with Marion&quot;). In reality what appeared was not so much a diary as cross between a series of essays and literary autobiography. He was encouraged by the publisher Peter Suhrkamp to develop the format, and Suhrkamp provided his own feedback and specific suggestions for improvements. In 1950 Suhrkamp&#x27;s own newly established publishing house produced a second volume of Frisch&#x27;s &quot;Tagebuch&quot; covering the period 1946–1949, comprising a mosaic of travelogues, autobiographical musings, essays on political and literary theory and literary sketches, adumbrating many of the themes and sub-currents of his later fictional works. Critical reaction to the new impetus that Frisch&#x27;s &quot;Tagebücher&quot; was giving to the genre of the &quot;literary diary&quot; was positive: there was a mention of Frisch having found a new way to connect with wider trends in European literature (&quot;Anschluss ans europäische Niveau&quot;). Sales of these works would nevertheless remain modest until the appearance of a new volume in 1958, by which time Frisch had become better known among the general book-buying public on account of his novels.

The &quot;Tagebuch 1946–1949&quot; was followed, in 1951, by &quot;Count Oederland&quot; (&quot;Graf Öderland&quot;), a play that picked up on a narrative that had already been sketched out in the &quot;diaries&quot;. The story concerns a state prosecutor named Martin who grows bored with his middle-class existence, and drawing inspiration from the legend of Count Oederland, sets out in search of total freedom, using an axe to kill anyone who stands in his way. He ends up as the leader of a revolutionary freedom movement, and finds that the power and responsibility that his new position imposes on him leaves him with no more freedom than he had before. This play flopped, both with the critics and with audiences, and was widely misinterpreted as the criticism of an ideology or as being essentially nihilistic, and strongly critical of the direction that Switzerland&#x27;s political consensus was by now following. Frisch nevertheless regarded &quot;Count Oederland&quot; as one of his most significant creations: he managed to get it returned to the stage in 1956 and again in 1961, but it failed, on both occasions, to win many new friends.

In 1951, Frisch was awarded a travel grant by the Rockefeller Foundation and between April 1951 and May 1952 he visited the United States and Mexico. During this time, under the working title &quot;What do you do with love?&quot; (&quot;Was macht ihr mit der Liebe?&quot;) on what later became his novel, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; (&quot;Stiller&quot;). Similar themes also underpinned the play &quot;Don Juan or the Love of Geometry&quot; (&quot;Don Juan oder Die Liebe zur Geometrie&quot;) which in May 1953 would open simultaneously at theatres in Zurich and Berlin. In this play Frisch returned to his theme of the conflict between conjugal obligations and intellectual interests. The leading character is a parody Don Juan, whose priorities involve studying geometry and playing chess, while women are let into his life only periodically. After his unfeeling conduct has led to numerous deaths the anti-hero finds himself falling in love with a former prostitute. The play proved popular and has been performed more than a thousand times, making it Frisch&#x27;s third most popular drama after &quot;The Fire Raisers&quot; (1953) and &quot;Andorra&quot; (1961).

The novel &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; appeared in 1954. The protagonist, Anatol Ludwig Stiller starts out by pretending to be someone else, but in the course of a court hearing he is forced to acknowledge his original identity as a Swiss sculptor. For the rest of his life he returns to live with the wife whom, in his earlier life, he had abandoned. The novel combines elements of crime fiction with an authentic and direct diary-like narrative style. It was a commercial success, and won for Frisch widespread recognition as a novelist. Critics praised its carefully crafted structure and perspectives, as well as the way it managed to combine philosophical insight with autobiographical elements. The theme of the incompatibility between art and family responsibilities is again on display. Following the appearance of this book Frisch, whose own family life had been marked by a succession of extra-marital affairs, left his family, moving to Männedorf, where he had his own small apartment in a farmhouse. By this time writing had become his principal source of income, and in January 1955 he closed his architectural practice, becoming officially a full-time freelance writer.

At the end of 1955 Frisch started work on his novel, &quot;Homo Faber&quot; which would be published in 1957. It concerns an engineer who views life through a &quot;technical&quot; ultra-rational prism. &quot;Homo Faber&quot; was chosen as a study text for the schools and became the most read of Frisch&#x27;s books. The book involves a journey which mirrors a trip that Frisch himself undertook to Italy in 1956, and subsequently to America (his second visit, this time also taking in Mexico and Cuba). The following year Frisch visited Greece, which is where the latter part of &quot;Homo Faber&quot; unfolds.

=== As a dramatist ===
The success of &quot;The Fire Raisers&quot; established Frisch as a world-class dramatist. It deals with a lower-middle-class man who is in the habit of giving shelter to vagrants who, despite clear warning signs to which he fails to react, burn down his house. Early sketches for the piece had been produced, in the wake of the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia, back in 1948, and had been published in his &quot;Tagebuch 1946–1949&quot;. A radio play based on the text had been transmitted in 1953 on Bavarian Radio (BR). Frisch&#x27;s intention with the play was to shake the self-confidence of the audience that, faced with equivalent dangers, they would necessarily react with the necessary prudence. Swiss audiences simply understood the play as a warning against Communism, and the author felt correspondingly misunderstood. For the subsequent premier in West Germany he added a little sequel which was intended as a warning against Nazism, though this was later removed.

A sketch for Frisch&#x27;s next play, &quot;Andorra&quot; had also already appeared in the &quot;Tagebuch 1946–1949&quot;. &quot;Andorra&quot; deals with the power of preconceptions concerning fellow human beings. The principal character, Andri, is a youth who is assumed to be Jewish, rescued from the neighboring &quot;Blackshirts&quot; by his Andorran father, the Teacher. The boy therefore has to deal with antisemitic prejudice, and while growing up he has acquired traits which those around him regard as &quot;typically Jewish&quot;. There is also exploration of various associated individual hypocrisies that arise in the small fictional country where the action takes place. It later transpires that Andri is his father&#x27;s real son and therefore not himself Jewish, although the townsfolk are too focused on their preconceptions to accept this. The themes of the play seem to have been particularly close to the author&#x27;s heart: in the space of three years Frisch had written no fewer than five versions before, towards the end of 1961, it received its first performance. The play was a success both with the critics and commercially. It nevertheless attracted controversy, especially after it opened in the United States, from those who thought that it treated with unnecessary frivolity issues which were still extremely painful so soon after the Nazi Holocaust had been publicised in the west. Another criticism was that by presenting its theme as one of generalised human failings, the play somehow diminished the level of specifically German guilt for recent real-life atrocities.

During July 1958 Frisch got to know the Carinthian writer Ingeborg Bachmann, and the two became lovers. He had left his wife and children in 1954 and now, in 1959, he was divorced. Although Bachmann rejected the idea of a formal marriage, Frisch nevertheless followed her to Rome where by now she lived, and the city became the centre of both their lives until (in Frisch&#x27;s case) 1965. The relationship between Frisch and Bachmann was intense. Frisch remained true to his habit of sexual infidelity, but reacted with intense jealousy when his partner demanded the right to behave in much the same way. His 1964 novel &quot;Gantenbein / A Wilderness of Mirrors&quot; (&quot;Mein Name sei Gantenbein&quot;) – and indeed Bachmann&#x27;s later novel, &quot;Malina&quot; – both reflect the writers&#x27; reactions to this relationship which broke down during the bitterly cold winter of 1962/63 when the lovers were staying in Uetikon. &quot;Gantenbein&quot; works through the ending of a marriage with a complicated succession of &quot;what if?&quot; scenarios: the identities and biographical background of the parties get switched along with details of their shared married life. This theme is echoed in &quot;Malina&quot;, where Bachmann&#x27;s narrator confesses that she is &quot;double&quot; to her lover (she is herself, but she is also her husband, Malina), leading to an ambiguous &quot;murder&quot; when the husband and wife part. Frisch tests alternative narratives &quot;like clothes&quot;, and comes to the conclusion that none of the tested scenarios leads to an entirely &quot;fair&quot; outcome. Frisch himself wrote of &quot;Gantenbein&quot; that his purpose was &quot;to show the reality of an individual by having him appear as a blank patch outlined by the sum of fictional entities congruent with his personality. ... The story is not told as if an individual could be identified by his factual behaviour; let him betray himself in his fictions.&quot;

His next play &quot;Biography: A game&quot; (&quot;Biografie: Ein Spiel&quot;), followed on naturally. Frisch was disappointed that his commercially very successful plays &quot;Biedermann und die Brandstifter&quot; and &quot;Andorra&quot; had both been, in his view, widely misunderstood. His answer was to move away from the play as a form of parable, in favour of a new form of expression which he termed &quot;Dramaturgy of Permutation&quot; (&quot;Dramaturgie der Permutation&quot;), a form which he had introduced with &quot;Gantenbein&quot; and which he now progressed with &quot;Biographie&quot;, written in its original version in 1967. At the centre of the play is a behavioural scientist who is given the chance to live his life again, and finds himself unable to take any key decisions differently the second time round. The Swiss premier of the play was to have been directed by Rudolf Noelte, but Frisch and Noelte fell out in the autumn of 1967, a week before the scheduled first performance, which led to the Zurich opening being postponed for several months. In the end the play opened in the Zürich Playhouse in February 1968, the performances being directed by Leopold Lindtberg. Lindtberg was a long established and well regarded theatre director, but his production of &quot;Biografie: Ein Spiel&quot; neither impressed the critics nor delighted theatre audiences. Frisch ended up deciding that he had been expecting more from the audience than he should have expected them to bring to the theatrical experience. After this latest disappointment it would be another eleven years before Frisch returned to theatrical writing.

=== Second marriage and living in other countries ===
In summer 1962 Frisch met Marianne Oellers, a student of Germanistic and Romance studies. He was 51 and she was 28 years younger. In 1964 they moved into an apartment together in Rome, and in autumn 1965 they relocated to Switzerland, setting up home together in an extensively modernised cottage in Berzona, Ticino. During the next decade much of their time was spent living in rented apartments abroad, and Frisch could be scathing about his Swiss homeland, but they retained their Berzona property and frequently returned to it, the author driving his Jaguar from the airport: as he himself was quoted at the time on his Ticino retreat, &quot;Seven times a year we drive this stretch of road and it happens every time: lust for existence at the wheel. This is fantastic countryside.&quot; As a &quot;social experiment&quot; they also, in 1966, temporarily occupied a second home in an apartment block in Aussersihl, a residential quarter of down-town Zurich known, then as now, for its high levels of recorded crime and delinquency, but they quickly swapped this for an apartment in Küsnacht, close to the lake shore. Frisch and Oellers were married at the end of 1968.

Oellers accompanied her future husband on numerous foreign trips. In 1963 they visited the United States for the American premieres of &quot;The Fire Raisers&quot; and &quot;Andorra&quot;, and in 1965 they visited Jerusalem where Frisch was presented with the Jerusalem Prize for the Freedom of the Individual in Society. In order to try to form an independent assessment of &quot;life behind the Iron Curtain&quot; they then, in 1966, toured the Soviet Union. They returned two years later to attend a Writers&#x27; Congress at which they met Christa and Gerhard Wolf, leading authors in what was then East Germany, with whom they established lasting friendships. After they married, Frisch and his young wife continued to travel extensively, visiting Japan in 1969 and undertaking extended stays in the United States. Many impressions of these visits are published in Frisch&#x27;s &quot;Tagebuch&quot; covering the period 1966–1971.

In 1972, after returning from the US, the couple took a second apartment in the Friedenau quarter of West Berlin, and this soon became the place where they spent most of their time. During the period 1973–79 Frisch was able to participate increasingly in the intellectual life of the place. Living away from his homeland intensified his negative attitude to Switzerland, which had already been apparent in &quot;William Tell for Schools&quot; (&quot;Wilhelm Tell für die Schule&quot;) (1970) and which reappears in his &quot;Little service book&quot; (&quot;Dienstbüchlein&quot;) (1974), in which he reflects on his time in the Swiss army some 30 years earlier. More negativity about Switzerland was on show in January 1974 when he delivered a speech titled &quot;Switzerland as a homeland?&quot; (&quot;Die Schweiz als Heimat?&quot;), when accepting the 1973 Grand Schiller Prize from the Swiss Schiller Foundation. Although he nurtured no political ambitions on his own account, Frisch became increasingly attracted to the ideas of social democratic politics. He also became friendly with Helmut Schmidt who had recently succeeded the Berlin–born Willy Brandt as Chancellor of Germany and was already becoming something of a respected elder statesman for the country&#x27;s moderate left (and, as a former Defence Minister, a target of opprobrium for some on the SPD&#x27;s &quot;im&quot;moderate left). In October 1975, slightly improbably, the Swiss dramatist Frisch accompanied Chancellor Schmidt on what for them both was their first visit to China, as part of an official West German delegation. Two years later, in 1977, Frisch found himself accepting an invitation to give a speech at an SPD Party Conference.

In April 1974, while on a book tour in the US, Frisch launched into an affair with an American called Alice Locke-Carey who was 32 years his junior. This happened in the village of Montauk on Long Island, and Montauk was the title the author gave to an autobiographical novel that appeared in 1975. The book centred on his love life, including both his own marriage with Marianne Oellers-Frisch and an affair that she had been having with the American writer Donald Barthelme. There followed a very public dispute between Frisch and his wife over where to draw the line between private and public life, and the two became increasingly estranged, divorcing in 1979.

== Later life and death ==
In 1978, Frisch survived serious health problems, and the next year was actively involved in setting up the Max Frisch Foundation (&quot;Max-Frisch-Stiftung&quot;), established in October 1979, and to which he entrusted the administration of his estate. The foundation&#x27;s archive is kept at the ETH Zurich, and has been publicly accessible since 1983.

Old age and the transience of life now came increasingly to the fore in Frisch&#x27;s work. In 1976 he began work on the play &quot;Triptychon&quot;, although it was not ready to be performed for another three years. The word triptych is more usually applied to paintings, and the play is set in three triptych-like sections in which many of the key characters are notionally dead. The piece was first unveiled as a radio play in April 1979, receiving its stage premier in Lausanne six months later. The play was rejected for performance in Frankfurt am Main where it was deemed too apolitical. The Austrian premier in Vienna at the Burgtheater was seen by Frisch as a success, although the audience reaction to the complexity of the work&#x27;s unconventional structure was still a little cautious.

In 1980, Frisch resumed contact with Alice Locke-Carey and the two of them lived together, alternately in New York City and in Frisch&#x27;s cottage in Berzona, till 1984. By now Frisch had become a respected and from time to time honoured writer in the United States. He received an honorary doctorate from Bard College in 1980 and another from New York&#x27;s City University in 1982. An English translation of the novella &quot;Man in the Holocene&quot; (&quot;Der Mensch erscheint im Holozän&quot;) was published by The New Yorker in May 1980, and was picked out by critics in The New York Times Book Review as the most important and most interesting published Narrative work of 1980. The story concerns a retired industrialist suffering from the decline in his mental faculties and the loss of the camaraderie which he used to enjoy with colleagues. Frisch was able, from his own experience of approaching old age, to bring a compelling authenticity to the piece, although he rejected attempts to play up its autobiographical aspects. After &quot;Man in the Holocene&quot; appeared in 1979 (in the German language edition) the author developed writer&#x27;s block, which ended only with the appearance, in the Autumn/Fall of 1981 of his final substantial literary piece, the prose text/novella &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (&quot;Blaubart&quot;).

In 1984 Frisch returned to Zurich, where he would live for the rest of his life. In 1983 he began a relationship with his final life partner, Karen Pilliod. She was 25 years younger than he was. In 1987 they visited Moscow and together took part in the &quot;Forum for a world liberated from atomic weapons&quot;. After Frisch&#x27;s death Pilliod let it be known that between 1952 and 1958 Frisch had also had an affair with her mother, Madeleine Seigner-Besson. In March 1989 he was diagnosed with incurable colorectal cancer. In the same year, in the context of the Swiss Secret files scandal, it was discovered that the national security services had been illegally spying on Frisch (as on many other Swiss citizens) ever since he had attended the International Peace Congress at Wrocław in 1948.

Frisch now arranged his funeral, but he also took time to engage in discussion about the abolition of the army, and published a piece in the form of a dialogue on the subject titled &quot;Switzerland without an Army? A Palaver&quot; (&quot;Schweiz ohne Armee? Ein Palaver&quot;) There was also a stage version titled &quot;Jonas and his veteran&quot; (&quot;Jonas und sein Veteran&quot;). Frisch died on 4 April 1991 while in the middle of preparing for his 80th birthday. The funeral, which Frisch had planned with some care, took place on 9 April 1991 at St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Zurich-Altstadt. His friends Peter Bichsel and Michel Seigner spoke at the ceremony. Karin Pilliod also read a short address, but there was no speech from any church minister. Frisch was an agnostic who found religious beliefs superfluous. His ashes were later scattered on a fire by his friends at a memorial celebration back in Ticino at a celebration of his friends. A tablet on the wall of the cemetery at Berzona commemorates him.

== Literary output ==

=== Genres ===

==== The diary as a literary form ====

The diary became a very characteristic prose form for Frisch. In this context, &quot;diary&quot; does not indicate a private record, made public to provide readers with voyeuristic gratification, nor an intimate journal of the kind associated with Henri-Frédéric Amiel. The diaries published by Frisch were closer to the literary &quot;structured consciousness&quot; narratives associated with Joyce and Döblin, providing an acceptable alternative but effective method for Frisch to communicate real-world truths. After he had intended to abandon writing, pressured by what he saw as an existential threat from his having entered military service, Frisch started to write a diary which would be published in 1940 with the title &quot;Pages from the Bread-bag&quot; (&quot;Blätter aus dem Brotsack&quot;). Unlike his earlier works, output in diary form could more directly reflect the author&#x27;s own positions. In this respect the work influenced Frisch&#x27;s own future prose works. He published two further literary diaries covering the periods 1946–1949 and 1966–1971. The typescript for a further diary, started in 1982, was discovered only in 2009 among the papers of Frisch&#x27;s secretary. Before that it had been generally assumed that Frisch had destroyed this work because he felt that the decline of his creativity and short-term memory meant that he could no longer do justice to the diary genre. The newly discovered typescript was published in March 2010 by Suhrkamp Verlag. Because of its rather fragmentary nature Frisch&#x27;s &quot;Diary 3&quot; (&quot;Tagebuch 3&quot;) was described by the publisher as a draft work by Frisch: it was edited and provided with an extensive commentary by Peter von Matt, chairman of the Max Frisch Foundation.

Many of Frisch&#x27;s most important plays, such as &quot;Count Oederland&quot; (&quot;Graf Öderland&quot;) (1951), &quot;Don Juan or the Love of Geometry&quot; (&quot;Don Juan oder Die Liebe zur Geometrie&quot;) (1953), &quot;The Fire Raisers&quot; (1953) and &quot;Andorra&quot; (1961), were initially sketched out in the &quot;Diary 1946–1949&quot; (&quot;Tagebuch 1946–1949&quot;) some years before they appeared as stage plays. At the same time several of his novels such as &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; (1954), &quot;Homo Faber&quot; (1957) as well as the narrative work &quot;Montauk&quot; (1975) take the form of diaries created by their respective protagonists. Sybille Heidenreich points out that even the more open narrative form employed in &quot;Gantenbein / A Wilderness of Mirrors&quot; (1964) closely follows the diary format. Rolf Keiser points out that when Frisch was involved in the publication of his collected works in 1976, the author was keen to ensure that they were sequenced chronologically and not grouped according to genre: in this way the sequencing of the collected works faithfully reflects the chronological nature of a diary.

Frisch himself took the view that the diary offered the prose format that corresponded with his natural approach to prose writing, something that he could &quot;no more change than the shape of his nose&quot;. Attempts were nevertheless made by others to justify Frisch&#x27;s choice of prose format. Frisch&#x27;s friend and fellow-writer, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, explained that in &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; the &quot;diary-narrative&quot; approach enabled the author to participate as a character in his own novel without embarrassment. (The play focuses on the question of identity, which is a recurring theme in the work of Frisch.) More specifically, in the character of James Larkin White, the American who in reality is indistinguishable from Stiller himself, but who nevertheless vigorously denies being the same man, embodies the author, who in his work cannot fail to identify the character as himself, but is nevertheless required by the literary requirements of the narrative to conceal the fact. Rolf Keiser points out that the diary format enables Frisch most forcefully to demonstrate his familiar theme that thoughts are always based on one specific standpoint and its context; and that it can never be possible to present a comprehensive view of the world, nor even to define a single life, using language alone.

==== Narrative form ====

Frisch&#x27;s first public success was as a writer for theatre, and later in his life he himself often stressed that he was in the first place a creature of the theatre. Nevertheless, the diaries, and even more than these, the novels and the longer narrative works are among his most important literary creations. In his final decades Frisch tended to move away from drama and concentrate on prose narratives. He himself is on record with the opinion that the subjective requirements of story telling suited him better than the greater level of objectivity required by theatre work.

In terms of the timeline, Frisch&#x27;s prose works divide roughly into three periods.

His first literary works, up till 1943, all employed prose formats. There were numerous short sketches and essays along with three novels or longer narratives, &quot;Jürg Reinhart&quot; (1934), its belated sequel &quot;J&#x27;adore ce qui me brûle&quot; (&quot;I adore that which burns me&quot;) (1944) and the narrative &quot;An Answer from the Silence&quot; (&quot;Antwort aus der Stille&quot;) (1937). All three of the substantive works are autobiographical and all three centre round the dilemma of a young author torn between bourgeois respectability and &quot;artistic&quot; life style, exhibiting on behalf of the protagonists differing outcomes to what Frisch saw as his own dilemma.

The high period of Frisch&#x27;s career as an author of prose works is represented by the three novels &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; (1954), &quot;Homo Faber&quot; (1957) and &quot;Gantenbein&quot; / &quot;A Wilderness of Mirrors&quot; (1964), of which &quot;Stiller&quot; is generally regarded as his most important and most complex book, according to the US based German scholar Alexander Stephan, in terms both of its structure and its content. What all three of these novels share is their focus on the identity of the individual and on the relationship between the sexes. In this respect &quot;Homo Faber&quot; and &quot;Stiller&quot; offer complementary situations. If Stiller had rejected the stipulations set out by others, he would have arrived at the position of Walter Faber, the ultra-rationalist protagonist of &quot;Homo Faber&quot;. &quot;Gantenbein / A Wilderness of Mirrors&quot; (&quot;Mein Name sei Gantenbein&quot;) offers a third variation on the same theme, apparent already in its (German language) title. Instead of boldly asserting &quot;I am not (Stiller)&quot; the full title of &quot;Gantenbein&quot; uses the German &quot;Konjunktiv II&quot; (subjunctive mood) to give a title along the lines &quot;My name represents (Gantenbein)&quot;. The protagonist&#x27;s aspiration has moved on from the search for a fixed identity to a less binary approach, trying to find a midpoint identity, testing out biographical and historic scenarios.

Again, the three later prose works &quot;Montauk&quot; (1975), &quot;Man in the Holocene&quot; (&quot;Der Mensch erscheint im Holozän&quot;) (1979), and &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (&quot;Blaubart&quot;) (1981), are frequently grouped together by scholars. All three are characterized by a turning towards death and a weighing up of life. Structurally they display a savage pruning of narrative complexity. The Hamburg born critic Volker Hage identified in the three works &quot;an underlying unity, not in the sense of a conventional trilogy ... but in the sense that they together form a single literary chord. The three books complement one another while each retains its individual wholeness ... All three books have a flavour of the balance sheet in a set of year-end financial accounts, disclosing only that which is necessary: summarized and zipped up&quot;. Frisch himself produced a more succinct &quot;author&#x27;s judgement&quot;: &quot;The last three narratives have just one thing in common: they allow me to experiment with presentational approaches that go further than the earlier works.&quot;

==== Dramas ====

Frisch&#x27;s dramas up until the early 1960s are divided by the literary commentator Manfred Jurgensen into three groups: (1) the early wartime pieces, (2) the poetic plays such as &quot;Don Juan or the Love of Geometry&quot; (&quot;Don Juan oder Die Liebe zur Geometrie&quot;) and (3) the dialectical pieces. It is above all with this third group, notably the parable &quot;The Fire Raisers&quot; (1953), identified by Frisch as a &quot;lesson without teaching&quot;, and with &quot;Andorra&quot; (1961) that Frisch enjoyed the most success. Indeed, these two are among the most successful German language plays. The writer nevertheless remained dissatisfied because he believed they had been widely misunderstood. In an interview with Heinz Ludwig Arnold Frisch vigorously rejected their allegorical approach: &quot;I have established only that when I apply the parable format, I am obliged to deliver a message that I actually do not have&quot;. After the 1960s Frisch moved away from the theatre. His late biographical plays &quot;Biography: A game&quot; (&quot;Biografie: Ein Spiel&quot;) and &quot;Triptychon&quot; were apolitical but they failed to match the public success of his earlier dramas. It was only shortly before his death that Frisch returned to the stage with a more political message, with &quot;Jonas and his Veteran&quot;, a stage version of his arresting dialogue &quot;Switzerland without an army? A Palaver&quot;.

For Klaus Müller-Salget, the defining feature which most of Frisch&#x27;s stage works share is their failure to present realistic situations. Instead they are mind games that toy with time and space. For instance, &quot;The Chinese Wall&quot; (&quot;Die Chinesische Mauer&quot;) (1946) mixes literary and historical characters, while in the Triptychon we are invited to listen to the conversations of various dead people. In &quot;Biography: A game&quot; (&quot;Biografie: Ein Spiel&quot;) a life-story is retrospectively &quot;corrected&quot;, while &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; and &quot;Count Oederland&quot; (&quot;Graf Öderland&quot;) combine aspects of a dream sequence with the features of a morality tale. Characteristic of Frisch&#x27;s stage plays are minimalist stage-sets and the application of devices such as splitting the stage in two parts, use of a &quot;Greek chorus&quot; and characters addressing the audience directly. In a manner reminiscent of Brecht&#x27;s epic theatre, audience members are not expected to identify with the characters on stage, but rather to have their own thoughts and assumptions stimulated and provoked. Unlike Brecht however, Frisch offered few insights or answers, preferring to leave the audience the freedom to provide their own interpretations.

Frisch himself acknowledged that the part of writing a new play that most fascinated him was the first draft, when the piece was undefined, and the possibilities for its development were still wide open. The critic Hellmuth Karasek identified in Frisch&#x27;s plays a mistrust of dramatic structure, apparent from the way in which &quot;Don Juan or the Love of Geometry&quot; applies theatrical method. Frisch prioritized the unbelievable aspects of theatre and valued transparency. Unlike his friend, the dramatist Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Frisch had little appetite for theatrical effects, which might distract from doubts and sceptical insights included in a script. For Frisch, effects came from a character being lost for words, from a moment of silence, or from a misunderstanding. And where a Dürrenmatt drama might lead, with ghastly inevitability, to a worst possible outcome, the dénouement in a Frisch play typically involved a return to the starting position: the destiny that awaited his protagonist might be to have no destiny.

=== Style and language ===
Frisch&#x27;s style changed across the various phases of his work.

His early work is strongly influenced by the poetical imagery of Albin Zollinger, and not without a certain imitative lyricism, something from which in later life he would distance himself, dismissing it as &quot;phoney poeticising&quot; &quot;(&quot;falsche Poetisierung&quot;)&quot;. His later works employed a tighter, consciously unpretentious style, which Frisch himself described as &quot;generally very colloquial&quot; (&quot;im Allgemeinen sehr gesprochen.&quot;). Walter Schenker saw Frisch&#x27;s first language as Zurich German, the dialect of Swiss German with which he grew up. The Standard German to which he was introduced as a written and literary language is naturally preferred for his written work, but not without regular appearances by dialect variations, introduced as stylistic devices.

A defining element in Frisch was an underlying scepticism as to the adequacy of language. In &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; his protagonist cries out, &quot;I have no language for my reality!&quot; (&quot;... ich habe keine Sprache für meine Wirklichkeit!&quot;). The author went further in his &quot;Diary 1946–49&quot; (&quot;Tagebuch 1946–49&quot;): 
What is important: the unsayable, the white space between the words, while these words themselves we always insert as side-issues, which as such are not the central part of what we mean. Our core concern remains unwritten, and that means, quite literally, that you write around it. You adjust the settings. You provide statements that can never contain actual experience: experience itself remains beyond the reach of language... and that unsayable reality appears, at best, as a tension between the statements. Werner Stauffacher saw in Frisch&#x27;s language &quot;a language of searching for humanity&#x27;s unspeakable reality, the language of visualisation and exploration&quot;, but one that never actually uncovers the underlying secret of reality.

Frisch adapted the principles of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s Epic theatre both to his dramas and to his prose works. As early as 1948 he concluded a contemplative piece on the alienation effect with the observation, &quot;One might be tempted to ascribe all these thoughts to the narrative author: the linguistic application of the alienation effect, the wilfully mischievous aspect of the prose, the uninhibited artistry which most German language readers will reject because they find it &#x27;too arty&#x27; and because it inhibits empathy and connection, sabotaging the conventional illusion that the story in the narrative really happened&quot;. Notably, in the 1964 novel &quot;Gantenbein&quot; &quot;(&quot;A Wilderness of Mirrors&quot;)&quot;, Frisch rejected the conventional narrative continuum, presenting instead, within a single novel, a small palette of variations and possibilities. The play &quot;Biography: A game&quot; (&quot;Biografie: Ein Spiel&quot;) (1967) extended similar techniques to theatre audiences. Already in &quot;Stiller&quot; (1954) Frisch embedded, in a novel, little sub-narratives in the form of fragmentary episodic sections from his &quot;diaries&quot;. In his later works Frisch went further with a form of montage technique that produced a literary collage of texts, notes and visual imagery in &quot;The Holozän&quot; (1979).

=== Themes and motifs ===
Frisch&#x27;s literary work centres around certain core themes and motifs many of which, in various forms, recur through the entire range of the author&#x27;s output.

==== Image vs. identity ====
In the &quot;Diary 1946–1949&quot; Frisch spells out a central idea that runs through his subsequent work: &quot;You shall not make for yourself any graven image, God instructs us. That should also apply in this sense: God lives in every person, though we may not notice. That oversight is a sin that we commit and it is a sin that is almost ceaselessly committed against us – except if we love&quot;. The biblical instruction is here taken to be applied to the relationship between people. It is only through love that people may manifest the mutability and versatility necessary to accept one another&#x27;s intrinsic inner potential. Without love people reduce one another and the entire world down to a series of simple preformed images. Such a cliché based image constitutes a sin against the self and against the other.

Hans Jürg Lüthi divides Frisch&#x27;s work, into two categories according to how this image is treated. In the first category, the destiny of the protagonist is to live the simplistic image. Examples include the play &quot;Andorra&quot; (1961) in which Andri, identified (wrongly) by the other characters as a Jew is obliged to work through the fate assigned to him by others. Something analogous arises with the novel &quot;Homo Faber&quot; (1957) where the protagonist is effectively imprisoned by the technician&#x27;s &quot;ultra-rational&quot; prism through which he is fated to conduct his existence. The second category of works identified by Lüthi centres on the theme of libration from the lovelessly predetermined image. In this second category he places the novels &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; (1954) and &quot;Gantenbein&quot; (1964), in which the leading protagonists create new identities precisely in order to cast aside their preformed cliché-selves.

Real personal identity stands in stark contrast to this simplistic image. For Frisch, each person possesses a unique individuality, justified from the inner being, and which needs to be expressed and realized. To be effective it can operate only through the individual&#x27;s life, or else the individual self will be incomplete. The process of self acceptance and the subsequent self-actualization constitute a liberating act of choice: &quot;The differentiating human worth of a person, it seems to me, is choice&quot;. The &quot;selection of self&quot; involves not a one-off action, but a continuing truth that the &quot;real myself&quot; must repeatedly recognize and activate, behind the simplistic images. The fear that the individual &quot;myself&quot; may be overlooked and the life thereby missed, was already a central theme in Frisch&#x27;s early works. A failure in the &quot;selection of self&quot; was likely to result in alienation of the self both from itself and from the human world more generally. Only within the limited span of an individual human life can personal existence find a fulfilment that can exclude the individual from the endless immutability of death. In &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; Frisch set out a criterion for a fulfilled life as being &quot;that an individual be identical with himself. Otherwise he has never really existed&quot;.

==== Relationships between the sexes ====
Claus Reschke says that the male protagonists in Frisch&#x27;s work are all similar modern Intellectual types: egocentric, indecisive, uncertain in respect of their own self-image, they often misjudge their actual situation. Their interpersonal relationships are superficial to the point of agnosticism, which condemns them to live as isolated loners. If they do develop some deeper relationship involving women, they lose emotional balance, becoming unreliable partners, possessive and jealous. They repeatedly assume outdated gender roles, masking sexual insecurity behind chauvinism. All this time their relationships involving women are overshadowed by feelings of guilt. In a relationship with a woman they look for &quot;real life&quot;, from which they can obtain completeness and self-fulfilment, untrammelled by conflict and paralyzing repetition, and which will never lose elements of novelty and spontaneity.

Female protagonists in Frisch&#x27;s work also lead back to a recurring gender-based stereotype, according to Mona Knapp. Frisch&#x27;s compositions tend to be centred on male protagonists, around which his leading female characters, virtually interchangeable, fulfil a structural and focused function. Often they are idolised as &quot;great&quot; and &quot;wonderful&quot;, superficially emancipated and stronger than the men. However, they actually tend to be driven by petty motivations: disloyalty, greed and unfeelingness. In the author&#x27;s later works the female characters become increasingly one-dimensional, without evidencing any inner ambivalence. Often the women are reduced to the role of a simple threat to the man&#x27;s identity, or the object of some infidelity, thereby catalysing the successes or failings of the male&#x27;s existence, so providing the male protagonist with an object for his own introspection. For the most part, the action in the male-female relationship in a work by Frisch comes from the woman, while the man remains passive, waiting and reflective. Superficially the woman is loved by the man, but in truth she is feared and despised.

From her thoughtfully feminist perspective, Karin Struck saw Frisch&#x27;s male protagonists manifesting a high level of dependency on the female characters, but the women remain strangers to them. The men are, from the outset, focused on the ending of the relationship: they cannot love because they are preoccupied with escaping from their own failings and anxieties. Often they conflate images of womanliness with images of death, as in Frisch&#x27;s take on the Don Juan legend: &quot;The woman reminds me of death, the more she seems to blossom and thrive&quot;. Each new relationship with a woman, and the subsequent separation was, for a Frisch male protagonist, analogous to a bodily death: his fear of women corresponded with fear of death, which meant that his reaction to the relationship was one of flight and shame.

==== Transience and death ====

Death is an ongoing theme in Frisch&#x27;s work, but during his early and heyday periods it remains in the background, overshadowed by identity issues and relationships problems. Only with his later works does death become a core question. Frisch&#x27;s second published &quot;Diary&quot; (&quot;Tagebuch&quot;) launches the theme. A key sentence from the &quot;Diary 1966–1971&quot; (published 1972), repeated several times, is a quotation from Montaigne: &quot;So I dissolve; and I lose myself.&quot; The section focuses on the private and social problems of aging. Although political demands are incorporated, social aspects remain secondary to the central concentration on the self. The &quot;Diary&quot; fragmentary and hastily structured informality sustains a melancholy underlying mood. &quot;According to Swiss writer and literary critic Hugo Loetscher, the questionnaires are the intellectual and formal highlight of this diary: “Brilliant, precise and informative, our own person and therefore ourselves are circled using question marks&quot;. In eleven questionnaires Frisch asks seemingly innocuous questions on the topics of altruism, marriage, property, women, friendship, money, home, hope, humor, children and death. The answers reveal the complexity of the topics covered and confront the reader with contradictions. Frisch&#x27;s aim is to show, through irony, how one should think correctly.

The narrative Montauk (1975) also deals with old age. The autobiographically drawn protanonist&#x27;s lack of much future throws the emphasis back onto working through the past and an urge to live for the present. In the drama-piece, Triptychon, death is presented not necessarily directly, but as a way of referencing life metaphorically. Death reflects the ossification of human community, and in this way becomes a device for shaping lives. The narrative &quot;Man in the Holocene&quot; presents the dying process of an old man as a return to nature. According to Cornelia Steffahn there is no single coherent image of death presented in Frisch&#x27;s late works. Instead they describe the process of his own evolving engagement with the issue, and show the way his own attitudes developed as he himself grew older. Along the way he works through a range of philosophical influences including Montaigne, Kierkegaard, Lars Gustafsson and even Epicurus.

==== Political aspects ====
Frisch described himself as a socialist but never joined the political party. His early works were almost entirely apolitical. In the &quot;Blätter aus dem Brotsack&quot; (Diaries of military life), published in 1940, he comes across as a conventional Swiss patriot, reflecting the unifying impact on Swiss society of the perceived invasion risk then emanating from Germany. After Victory in Europe Day the threat to Swiss values and to the independence of the Swiss state diminished. Frisch now underwent a rapid transformation, evincing a committed political consciousness. In particular, he became highly critical of attempts to divide cultural values from politics, noting in his &quot;Diary 1946–1949&quot;: &quot;He who does not engage with politics is already a partisan of the political outcome that he wishes to avoid, because he is serving the ruling party.&quot; Sonja Rüegg, writing in 1998, says that Frisch&#x27;s aesthetics is driven by a fundamentally anti-ideological and critical animus, formed from a recognition of the writer&#x27;s status as an outsider within society. That generates opposition to the ruling order, the privileging of individual partisanship over activity on behalf of a social class, and an emphasis on asking questions.

Frisch&#x27;s social criticism was particularly sharp in respect of his Swiss homeland. In a much quoted speech that he gave when accepting the 1973 Schiller Prize he declared: &quot;I am Swiss, not simply because I hold a Swiss passport, was born on Swiss soil etc.: But I am Swiss by quasi-religious confession.&quot; There followed a qualification: &quot;Your homeland is not merely defined as a comfort or a convenience. &#x27;Homeland&#x27; means more than that&quot;. The criticism of Switzerland is already present in the aforementioned &quot;Blättern aus dem Brotsack&quot; and in &quot;Stiller&quot;, but it becomes paramount in the essays &quot;Überfremdung 1 and 2&quot;. In particular in &quot;Überfremdung 1&quot; Frisch expresses all his annoyance at the narrow-mindedness of a good part of the people and institutions of Switzerland in the face of the growing phenomenon of immigration in the fifties and sixties: &quot;A small master nation sees itself in danger: workers have been called and human beings are coming. They do not eat up prosperity, on the contrary, they are essential for prosperity&quot;. Frisch&#x27;s very public verbal assaults on the land of his birth, on the country&#x27;s public image of itself and on the unique international role of Switzerland emerged in his polemical, &quot;Achtung: Die Schweiz&quot;, and extended to a work titled, &quot;Wilhelm Tell für die Schule&quot; (&quot;William Tell for Schools&quot;) which sought to deconstruct the defining epic of the nation, reducing the William Tell legend to a succession of coincidences, miscalculations, dead-ends and opportunistic gambits. With his &quot;Little service book&quot; (&quot;Dienstbüchlein&quot;) (1974) Frisch revisited and re-evaluated his own period of service in the nation&#x27;s citizen army, and shortly before he died he went so far as to question outright the need for the army in &quot;Switzerland without an Army? A Palaver&quot;.

A characteristic pattern in Frisch&#x27;s life was the way that periods of intense political engagement alternated with periods of retreat back to private concerns. Bettina Jaques-Bosch saw this as a succession of slow oscillations by the author between public outspokenness and inner melancholy. Hans Ulrich Probst positioned the mood of the later works somewhere &quot;between resignation and the radicalism of an old republican&quot;. The last sentences published by Frisch are included in a letter addressed to the high-profile entrepreneur Marco Solari and published in the left of centre newspaper &quot;Wochenzeitung&quot;, and here he returned one last time to attacking the Swiss state: &quot;1848 was a great creation of free-thinking Liberalism which today, after a century of domination by a middle-class coalition, has become a squandered state – and I am still bound to this state by one thing: a passport (which I shall not be needing again)&quot;.

== Recognition ==

=== Success as a writer and as a dramatist ===
Interviewed in 1975, Frisch acknowledged that his literary career had not been marked by some &quot;sudden breakthrough&quot; (&quot;...frappanten Durchbruch&quot;) but that success had arrived, as he asserted, only very slowly. Nevertheless, even his earlier publications were not entirely without a certain success. In his 20s he was already having pieces published in various newspapers and journals. As a young writer he also had work accepted by an established publishing house, the Munich based Deutschen Verlags-Anstalt, which already included a number of distinguished German-language authors on its lists. When he decided he no longer wished to have his work published in Nazi Germany he changed publishers, joining up with Atlantis Verlag which had relocated their head office from Berlin to Zurich in response to the political changes in Germany. In 1950 Frisch switched publishers again, this time to the arguably more mainstream publishing house then being established in Frankfurt by Peter Suhrkamp.

Frisch was still only in his early 30s when he turned to drama, and his stage work found ready acceptance at the Zürich Playhouse, at that time one of Europe&#x27;s leading theatres, the quality and variety of its work much enhanced by an influx of artistic talent since the mid-1930s from Germany. Frisch&#x27;s early plays, performed at Zurich, were positively reviewed and won prizes. It was only in 1951, with &quot;Count Oederland&quot;, that Frisch experienced his &quot;first stage-flop&quot;. The experience encouraged him to pay more attention to audiences outside his native Switzerland, notably in the new and rapidly developing Federal Republic of Germany, where the novel &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; succeeded commercially on a scale that till then had eluded Frisch, enabling him now to become a full-time professional writer.

&quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; started with a print-run that provided for sales of 3,000 in its first year, but thanks to strong and growing reader demand it later became the first book published by Suhrkamp to top one million copies. The next novel, &quot;Homo Faber&quot;, was another best seller, with four million copies of the German language version produced by 1998. &quot;The Fire Raisers&quot; and &quot;Andorra&quot; are the most successful German language plays of all time, with respectively 250 and 230 productions up till 1996, according to an estimate made by the literary critic Volker Hage. The two plays, along with &quot;Homo Faber&quot; became curriculum favourites with schools in the German-speaking middle European countries. Apart from a few early works, most of Frisch&#x27;s books and plays have been translated into around ten languages, while the most translated of all, &quot;Homo Faber&quot;, has been translated into twenty-five languages.

=== Reputation in Switzerland and internationally ===
Frisch&#x27;s name is often mentioned along with that of another great writer of his generation, Friedrich Dürrenmatt. The scholar Hans Mayer likened them to the mythical half-twins, Castor and Pollux, as two dialectically linked &quot;antagonists&quot;. The close friendship of their early careers was later overshadowed by personal differences. In 1986 Dürrenmatt took the opportunity of Frisch&#x27;s 75th birthday to try and effect a reconciliation with a letter, but the letter went unanswered. In their approaches the two were very different. The literary journalist Heinz Ludwig Arnold quipped that Dürrenmatt, despite all his narrative work, was born to be a dramatist, while Frisch, his theatre successes notwithstanding, was born to be a writer of narratives.

In 1968, a 30-minute episode of the multinationally produced television series Creative Persons was devoted to Frisch.

In the 1960s, by publicly challenging some contradictions and settled assumptions, both Frisch und Dürrenmatt contributed to a major revision in Switzerland&#x27;s view of itself and its history. In 1974 Frisch published his &quot;Little service book&quot; (&quot;Dienstbüchlein&quot;), and from this time – possibly from earlier – Frisch became a powerfully divisive figure in Switzerland, where in some quarters his criticisms were vigorously rejected. For aspiring writers seeking a role model, most young authors preferred Frisch over Dürrenmatt as a source of instruction and enlightenment, according to Janos Szábo. In the 1960s Frisch inspired a generation of younger writers including Peter Bichsel, Jörg Steiner, Otto F. Walter, and Adolf Muschg. More than a generation after that, in 1998, when it was the turn of Swiss literature to be the special focus at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the literary commentator Andreas Isenschmid identified some leading Swiss writers from his own (baby-boomer) generation such as Ruth Schweikert, Daniel de Roulet and Silvio Huonder in whose works he had found &quot;a curiously familiar old tone, resonating from all directions, and often almost page by page, uncanny echoes from Max Frisch&#x27;s &quot;Stiller&quot;.&quot;
The works of Frisch were also important in West Germany. The West German essayist and critic Heinrich Vormweg described &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; and &quot;Homo Faber&quot; as &quot;two of the most significant and influential German-language novels of the 1950s&quot;. In East Germany during the 1980s Frisch&#x27;s prose works and plays also ran through many editions, although here they were not the focus of so much intensive literary commentary. Translations of Frisch&#x27;s works into the languages of other formally socialist countries in the Eastern Bloc were also widely available, leading the author himself to offer the comment that in the Soviet Union his works were officially seen as presenting the &quot;symptoms of a sick capitalist society, symptoms that would never be found where the means of production have been nationalized&quot;. Despite some ideologically driven official criticism of his &quot;individualism&quot;, &quot;negativity&quot; and &quot;modernism&quot;, Frisch&#x27;s works were actively translated into Russian, and were featured in some 150 reviews in the Soviet Union. Frisch also found success in his second &quot;homeland of choice&quot;, the United States where he lived, off and on, for some time during his later years. He was generally well regarded by the New York literary establishment: one commentator found him commendably free of &quot;European arrogance&quot;.

=== Influence and significance ===
Jürgen H. Petersen reckons that Frisch&#x27;s stage work had little influence on other dramatists. And his own preferred form of the &quot;literary diary&quot; failed to create a new trend in literary genres. By contrast, the novels &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; and &quot;Gantenbein&quot; have been widely taken up as literary models, because of the way they home in on questions of individual identity and on account of their literary structures. Issues of personal identity are presented not simply through description or interior insights, but through narrative contrivances. This stylistic influence can be found frequently in the works of others, such as Christa Wolf&#x27;s &quot;The Quest for Christa T.&quot; and in Ingeborg Bachmann&#x27;s &quot;Malina&quot;. Other similarly influenced authors are Peter Härtling and Dieter Kühn. Frisch also found himself featuring as a &quot;character&quot; in the literature of others. That was the case in 1983 with Wolfgang Hildesheimer&#x27;s &quot;Message to Max [Frisch] about the state of things and other matters&quot; (&quot;Mitteilungen an Max über den Stand der Dinge und anderes&quot;). By then Uwe Johnson had already, in 1975, produced a compilation of quotations which he called &quot;The collected sayings of Max Frisch&quot; (&quot;Max Frisch Stich-Worte zusammen&quot;). More recently, in 2007, the Zurich–born artist Gottfried Honegger published eleven portrait-sketches and fourteen texts in memory of his friend.

Adolf Muschg, purporting to address Frisch directly on the occasion of his seventieth birthday, contemplates the older man&#x27;s contribution: &quot;Your position in the history of literature, how can it be described? You have not been, in conventional terms, an innovator… I believe you have defined an era through something both unobtrusive and fundamental: a new experimental ethos (and pathos). Your books form deep literary investigation from an act of the imagination.&quot; Marcel Reich-Ranicki saw similarities with at least some of the other leading German-language writers of his time: &quot;Unlike Dürrenmatt or Böll, but in common with Grass and Uwe Johnson, Frisch wrote about the complexes and conflicts of intellectuals, returning again and again &quot;to us&quot;, creative intellectuals from the ranks of the educated middle-classes: no one else so clearly identified and saw into our mentality&quot;. Friedrich Dürrenmatt marvelled at his colleague: &quot;the boldness with which he immediately launches out with utter subjectivity. He is himself always at the heart of the matter. His matter is the matter. In Dürrenmatt&#x27;s last letter to Frisch he coined the formulation that Frisch in his work had made &quot;his case to the world&quot; (&quot;seinen Fall zur Welt&quot;).

=== Film ===

The film director Alexander J. Seiler believes that Frisch had for the most part an &quot;unfortunate relationship&quot; with film, even though his literary style is often reminiscent of cinematic technique. Seiler explains that Frisch&#x27;s work was often, in the author&#x27;s own words, looking for ways to highlight the &quot;white space&quot; between the words, which is something that can usually only be achieved using a film-set. Already, in the &quot;Diary 1946–1949&quot; there is an early sketch for a film-script, titled &quot;Harlequin&quot;. His first practical experience of the genre came in 1959, but with a project that was nevertheless abandoned, when Frisch resigned from the production of a film titled &quot;SOS Gletscherpilot&quot; (&quot;SOS Glacier Pilot&quot;), and in 1960 his draft script for &quot;William Tell&quot; (&quot;Castle in Flames&quot;) was turned down, after which the film was created anyway, totally contrary to Frisch&#x27;s intentions. In 1965 there were plans, under the Title &quot;Zürich – Transit&quot;, to film an episode from the novel &quot;Gantenbein&quot;, but the project was halted, initially by differences between Frisch and the film director Erwin Leiser and then, it was reported, by the illness of Bernhard Wicki who was brought in to replace Leiser. The &quot;Zürich – Transit&quot; project went ahead in the end, directed by Hilde Bechart, but only in 1992 a quarter century later, and a year after Frisch had died.

For the novels &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stiller&quot; and &quot;Homo Faber&quot; there were several film proposals, one of which involved casting the actor Anthony Quinn in &quot;Homo Faber&quot;, but none of these proposals was ever realised. It is nevertheless interesting that several of Frisch&#x27;s dramas were filmed for television adaptations. It was in this way that the first filmic adaptation of a Frisch prose work appeared in 1975, thanks to Georg Radanowicz, and titled &quot;The Misfortune&quot; (&quot;Das Unglück&quot;). This was based on a sketch from one of Frisch&#x27;s &quot;Diaries&quot;. It was followed in 1981 by a Richard Dindo television production based on the narrative &quot;Montauk&quot; and one by Krzysztof Zanussi based on &quot;Bluebeard&quot;. It finally became possible, some months after Frisch&#x27;s death, for a full-scale cinema version of &quot;Homo Faber&quot; to be produced. While Frisch was still alive he had collaborated with the filmmaker Volker Schlöndorff on this production, but the critics were nevertheless underwhelmed by the result. In 1992, however, &quot;Holozän&quot;, a film adaptation by Heinz Bütler and Manfred Eicher of &quot;Man in the Holocene&quot;, received a &quot;special award&quot; at the Locarno International Film Festival.

Frisch was awarded honorary degrees by the University of Marburg, Germany, in 1962, Bard College (1980), the City University of New York City (1982), the University of Birmingham (1984), and the TU Berlin (1987).

He also won many important German literature prizes: the Georg Büchner Prize in 1958, the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade (&quot;Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels&quot;) in 1976, and the &quot;Heinrich-Heine-Preis&quot; in 1989.

In 1965 he won the Jerusalem Prize for the Freedom of the Individual in Society.

The City of Zurich introduced the Max Frisch Prize in 1998 to celebrate the author&#x27;s memory. The prize is awarded every four years and comes with a CHF 50,000 payment to the winner.

The 100th anniversary of Frisch&#x27;s birth took place in 2011 and was marked by an exhibition in his home city of Zurich. The occasion was also celebrated by an exhibition at the Munich Literature Centre which carried the suitably enigmatic tagline, &quot;Max Frisch. Heimweh nach der Fremde&quot; and another exhibition at the Museo Onsernonese in Loco, close to the Ticinese cottage to which Frisch regularly retreated over several decades.

In 2015 a new city-square in Zurich was named &quot;Max-Frisch-Platz&quot;. This is part of a larger urban redevelopment scheme which is being coordinated with a major building project underway to expand Zürich Oerlikon railway station.

<text>Valladolid (; Sakiʼ in Maya) is a city located in the eastern region of the Mexican state of Yucatán. It is the seat of Valladolid Municipality. As of the 2020 census the population of the city was 56,494 inhabitants (the third-largest community in the state after Kanasín), and that of the municipality was 85,460. Valladolid is located approximately 170 km (105 mi) east of the state capital Mérida, 40 km (25 mi) east of Chichén Itzá, and 150 km (93 mi) west of Cancún.

On August 30, 2012, Valladolid became part of the &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; promotional initiative led by the federal Secretariat of Tourism. 

==History==
Named after Valladolid, at the time the capital of Spain. Valladolid in Yucatán was established by Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Montejo&#x27;s nephew on May 27, 1543, at some distance from the current town, at a lagoon called Chouac-Ha in the municipality of Tizimín. Early Spanish settlers complained about the mosquitos and humidity at the original location, and petitioned to have the city moved further inland. On March 24, 1545, Valladolid was relocated to its current location, built atop a Maya town called &quot;Zací&quot; or &quot;Zací-Val&quot;, whose buildings were dismantled to reuse the stones to build the Spanish colonial town. The following year the Maya people revolted, but the rebellion was suppressed with the support of additional Spanish troops from Mérida.

In 1705 there was another revolt by local Maya; the rebels killed a number of town officials who had taken refuge in the cathedral. When the revolt was suppressed, the cathedral was considered irreparably profaned, and was demolished. A new cathedral was built the following year that still exists; it was oriented to face north unlike most other Colonial churches in Yucatán which face east.

Valladolid had a population of 15,000 in 1840. In January 1847, the native Mayas rioted, killing some eighty whites and sacking their houses. After a Maya noble was shot by firing squad, the riot became a general uprising. It was led by Jacinto Pat, &quot;batab&quot; of Tihosuco and by Cecilio Chi of nearby Ichmul. The city and the surrounding region was the scene of intense battle during Yucatán&#x27;s Caste War, and the Ladino forces were compelled to abandon Valladolid on March 14, 1848; with half being killed by ambush before they reached Mérida. The city was sacked by the Maya rebels but was recaptured later in the war.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, Valladolid was the third largest and most important city of the Yucatán Peninsula, (after Mérida and Campeche). It had a sizable well-to-do &quot;Criollo&quot; population, with a number of old Spanish style mansions in the old city. Valladolid was widely known by its nickname The Sultana of the East.

==Sights==

Valladolid is a popular city in which to explore the history and culture of the Yucatán Peninsula. Notable sights include the colonial-era ex-convent and church Convent of San Bernardino de Siena (named after saint Bernardino of Siena), which was built by Franciscan missionaries between 1552 and 1560 in the Sisal neighbourhood. In downtown Valladolid is the Cathedral of San Servacio (named after Saint Servatius), located in the main square of the city. The center of the city&#x27;s grid-like road structure features a plaza — Parque Principal Francisco Cantón Rosado — surrounded by restaurants and shops and filled with &quot;sillas tú y yo&quot; common to the Yucatán peninsula. Located close to the heart of the city is the Cenote Zací, a landscaped freshwater cenote or underground sinkhole in which visitors can explore and swim. There is also a restaurant on the premises of the Cenote Zací and artisans selling handcrafts. Valladolid is a popular base for visiting nearby major Maya ruins such as Chichén Itzá and Ekʼ Balam, as well as Cenote Ik Kil. Many principal sites are marked with bilingual signage to make them more hospitable for English-speaking tourists.

==Gastronomy==

The typical dish of the region is &quot;Lomitos de Valladolid&quot; which is a pork dish in fresh tomato sauce; &quot;Cochinita pibil&quot; meat marinated in &quot;achiote&quot;, and spices, wrapped in banana leaf and barbecued or baked in a pit; &quot;lechon al horno&quot;, &quot;bistek de cazuela&quot;, &quot;relleno negro&quot; which is turkey cooked with a paste of charred chillies and vegetables with bits of hard-boiled eggs, &quot;frijol con puerco&quot; and chicken in &quot;escabeche&quot;. Valladolid is also known for its &quot;longaniza&quot; which are a type of pork-based salami sausage with traditional condiments. Local traditional candies are based on materials from the region such as honey, coconut, corn and others. Traditional ice cream is also very popular. The most common flavours are coconut, corn and fruits of the region as &quot;guanabana&quot;, &quot;mamey sapote&quot; and others.

==Climate==
The climate in the Yucatán Peninsula is hot and dry. There is also tropical rain with hot and predominate trade winds most times of the year. Valladolid features a tropical wet and dry climate. The city lies in the trade wind belt close to the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. Valladolid&#x27;s climate is hot and humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 °C (91 °F), ranging from 28 °C (82 °F) in January to 36 °C (97 °F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 °C (100 °F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between 18 °C (64 °F) in January to 23 °C (73 °F) in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in Valladolid than coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.

==Transportation==

Valladolid has a grid layout for streets and is connected to surrounding areas by federal highways. Highway 180 and its tolled variant both traverse the city and connect it to Cancún as well as archaeological sites. An Autobuses de Oriente bus terminal situated in the heart of the city also connects Valladolid to other parts of the Yucatán Peninsula.

The population taken at the 2001 census was 2,707, increasing to 2,867 at the 2011 census. Repton is close to the county boundary with neighbouring Staffordshire and about northeast of Burton upon Trent.

The village is noted for St Wystan&#x27;s Church, for Repton School, for the Anglo-Saxon Repton Abbey and for the medieval Repton Priory.

==History==

Christianity was reintroduced to the Midlands at Repton, where some of the Mercian royal family under Peada were baptised in AD 653. Soon a double abbey under an abbess was built.

In 669 the Bishop of Mercia translated his see from Repton to Lichfield. Offa, King of Mercia, seemed to resent his own bishops paying allegiance to the Archbishop of Canterbury in Kent who, while under Offa&#x27;s control, was not of his own kingdom of Mercia. Offa therefore created his own Archdiocese of Lichfield, which presided over all the bishops from the Humber to the Thames. Repton was thus the forebear of the archdiocese of Lichfield, a third archdiocese of the English church: Lichfield, the other two being Canterbury and York. This lasted for only 16 years, however, before Mercia returned to being under the Archbishopric of Canterbury.

At the centre of the village is the Church of England parish church dedicated to Wystan (or Wigstan) of Mercia.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; also reports that 873–874 the Great Heathen Army overwintered at Repton. The first indications of Viking presence at Repton were discovered by accident in the late 17th century by Thomas Walker who found a pit of bones in the vicarage garden. A hogback tombstone was discovered sometime during 1801–1802 in the western part of the churchyard. An extensive programme of archaeological excavations, led by Martin Biddle and his wife, Birthe, that took place between 1974 and 1988 led the Biddles to identify the Viking camp with a D-shaped earthwork that they identified on a bluff, overlooking an arm of the River Trent. In more recent times the view that the entire Viking army spent the winter in this small (0.4 ha.) D-shaped enclosure has been challenged. 

A new set of excavations led by Cat Jarman and Mark Horton began in 2015 with a geophysical survey of the vicarage conducted which revealed new structures. During the 2016–2017 excavations, ground-penetrating radar surveys revealed more possible structures that were subsequently excavated and proved to be grave deposits. These contained a number of pits and stone features such as broken quern stones and a fragment of a carved sandstone cross shaft.

The Biddles also re-opened a mound containing a mass grave containing the remains of at least 264 individuals which they also believed to be associated with the Viking army. The bones were disarticulated and mostly jumbled together. Forensic study revealed that the individuals ranged in age from their late teens to about forty, 80% were male where sex could be determined. Five associated pennies fit well with the overwintering date of 873–874 and this date was later confirmed by a reassessment of the radiocarbon dates.

An early 18th century account describes how, in the last quarter of the 17th century, Thomas Walker, a workman looking for stone, opened the mound and found the skeleton of a &quot;nine foot tall&quot; man in a stone coffin in the remains of a building. According to the account, human bones had been neatly stacked around the coffin.

==Parish church==
The church is notable for its Anglo-Saxon crypt, which was built in the 8th century AD as a mausoleum for the Mercian royal family. Wystan, or Wigstan, was a prince of Mercia who was murdered by his guardian in 849, in the reign of Wiglaf. His remains were buried in the crypt at Repton and miracles were ascribed to them. Repton proceeded to become a place of pilgrimage; Wigstan was later canonised and became the patron saint of the church.

At the north edge of the village is St Wystan&#x27;s Church, an Anglo-Saxon church dedicated to the Anglo-Saxon Saint Wystan (or Wigstan) and designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The 8th-century crypt beneath the church was the original burial place of Saint Wigstan, as well as his grandfather, King Wiglaf of Mercia. Also buried there is King Æthelbald of Mercia, under whose reign the building was first constructed, and for whom it was first converted to a mausoleum. Upon the burial of St Wigstan, the crypt became a shrine and place of pilgrimage.

It has been suggested that the crypt at Repton later influenced the design of both the spiral-columned shrine of Edward the Confessor and the Cosmati Coronation Pavement in Westminster Abbey, both commissioned by Henry III, based on close correspondence of their dimensions and design.

The cruciform Anglo-Saxon church itself has had several additions and restorations throughout its history. These include Medieval Gothic north and south aisles in the nave that were rebuilt in the 13th century and widened early in the 14th century, and the addition in 1340 of the west tower and recessed spire. The church was also restored between 1885 and 1886 by Arthur Blomfield.

<text>A groyne (in the U.S. groin) is a rigid hydraulic structure built perpendicularly from an ocean shore (in coastal engineering) or a river bank, interrupting water flow and limiting the movement of sediment. It is usually made out of wood, concrete, or stone. In the ocean, groynes create beaches, prevent beach erosion caused by longshore drift where this is the dominant process and facilitate beach nourishment. There is also often cross-shore movement which if longer than the groyne will limit its effectiveness. In a river, groynes slow down the process of erosion and prevent ice-jamming, which in turn aids navigation.

All of a groyne may be underwater, in which case it is a &quot;submerged groyne&quot;. They are often used in tandem with seawalls and other coastal engineering features. Groynes, however, may cause a shoreline to be perceived as unnatural. Groynes are generally straight but could be of various plan view shapes, permeable or impermeable, built from various materials such as wood, sand, stone rubble, or gabion, etc.

== Background ==
=== Etymology ===
The term &quot;groyne&quot; is derived from the Old French , from Late Latin , &quot;snout&quot;.

=== History ===
==== Ancient Egypt and Nubia ====
A large number of groynes were found along a 1,000-kilometre stretch of the river Nile, between the first and the fourth cataract. The earliest ones dated so far were found to be over 3,000 years old, but researchers are hypothising that the technique might already have been understood in the fourth millennium BCE. The newly discovered groynes are located in what are now Egypt (Aswan), but mainly in Sudan, in areas of ancient Nubia, some of them built by the Egyptian overlords and some possibly the work of local Nubians.

==== 16th- to 19th-century England ====
One of the earliest mentions of groynes is in connection with the planned improvements to the silted-up Dover harbour, by one Fernando Poyntz in 1582.

In 1713 the first wooden groyne to protect Brighton&#x27;s seafront and coastline was built, which had been heavily damaged in the Great storm of 1703, and again in 1705. In 1867, the first concrete groyne was built near East Street, Brighton as a promenade long.

== Mechanics ==


=== Beach evolution and sedimentation accretion ===
A groyne gradually creates and maintains a wide area of beach on its updrift side by trapping the sediments suspended in the ocean current. This process is called accretion of sand and gravel or beach evolution. It reduces erosion on the other, i.e. downdrift, side by reducing the speed and power of the waves striking the shore. It is a physical barrier to stop sediment transport in the direction of longshore drift (also called longshore transport). If a groyne is correctly designed, then the amount of material it can hold will be limited, and excess sediment will be free to move on through the system. However, if a groyne is too large it may trap too much sediment, which can cause severe beach erosion on the down-drift side.

=== Groyne fields ===
Groynes are generally placed in series, generally all perpendicular to the shore. The areas between groups of groynes are groyne fields.

=== Terminal groyne syndrome ===

A poorly designed groyne (too long and not suited to the unique features of the coast) can also accelerate the erosion of the downdrift beach, which receives little or no sand from longshore drift. This process is known as terminal groyne syndrome, because in a series of groynes it occurs after the terminal groyne (last groyne on the downdrift side of the beach or coastline).

=== Headland groyne / Headland breakwater ===
A &quot;breakwater&quot; is an artificial offshore structure built parallel to the shore -- similar to naturally formed barrier islands -- that normally remains unattached to the shore. When a groyne is built to attach the breakwater to the shore, it is called a &quot;headland groyne&quot;, also known as &quot;bulkhead groyne&quot;, &quot;headland breakwater&quot;, &quot;T-head groyne&quot;, or &quot;T-shaped groyne&quot;.

== Usage ==
=== Coastal management ===

A groyne&#x27;s length and elevation, and the spacing between groynes is determined according to local wave energy and beach slope. Groynes that are too long or too high tend to accelerate downdrift erosion, and are ineffective because they trap too much sediment. Groynes that are too short, too low, or too permeable are ineffective because they trap too little sediment. If a groyne does not extend far enough landward, water (for example at a high tide combined with a storm surge) may flow past the landward end and erode a channel bypassing the groyne, a process known as &quot;flanking&quot;.

===River management===

River groynes (spur dykes, wing dykes, or wing dams) are often constructed nearly perpendicular to the riverbanks, beginning at a riverbank with a root and ending at the regulation line with a head. They maintain a channel to prevent ice jamming, and more generally improve navigation and control over lateral erosion, that would form from meanders. Groynes have a major impact on the river morphology: they cause autonomous degradation of the river.

They are also used around bridges to prevent bridge scour.

==Types==
Groynes can be distinguished by how they are constructed, whether they are submerged, their effect on stream flow or by shape.

===By their planview shape===
Groynes can be built with different planview shapes. Some examples include straight groynes, hockey stick or curved, inverted hockey stick groynes, tail or checkmark shaped groynes, L head, straight groynes with pier head (seaward end raised on the stilts, since the pier head is raised on the stilts it does not act as the breakwater), T-head (headland groyne, breakwater attached to the shore with straight groyne, the head/breakwater itself could be shaped straight, Y-shaped, arrow or wing shaped head).

=== By cross-section based on material used ===
Wooden groynes, sheetpile groynes, sandbag groynes, rubble mound or gabion groynes, etc.

===By permeability===
Groynes can be permeable, allowing the water to flow through at reduced velocities, or impermeable, blocking and deflecting the current.
* Permeable groynes are large rocks, bamboo or timber
* impermeable groynes (solid groynes or rock armour groynes) are constructed using rock, gravel, gabions.

===By whether they are submerged===
Groynes can be submerged or not under normal conditions. Usually impermeable groynes are non-submerged, since flow over the top of solid groynes may cause severe erosion along the shanks. Submerged groynes, on the other hand, may be permeable depending on the degree of flow disturbance needed.

===By their effect on stream flow===
Groynes can be attracting, deflecting or repelling.
* Attracting groynes point downstream, serving to attract the stream flow toward themselves and not repel the flow toward the opposite bank. They tend to maintain deep current close to the bank.
* Deflecting groynes change the direction of flow without repelling it. They are generally short and used for limited, local protection.
* Repelling groynes point upstream; they force the flow away from themselves. A single groyne may have one section, for example, attracting, and another section deflecting.

<text>Axiomatic () is a 1995 collection of short science fiction stories by Greg Egan. The stories all delve into different aspects of self and identity.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;Wonderful mind-expanding stuff, and well-written too.&quot;

==Neural mods==

Several &quot;Axiomatic&quot; stories involve &quot;neural mods&quot;, usually presented as small tubes containing powder inhaled through the nose, which alter the brains of their users in highly specific ways with advanced nanotechnology.

In the collection&#x27;s eponymous story &quot;Axiomatic&quot;, the protagonist enters a store selling mods not only for every variety of psychedelic experiences, but for altering one&#x27;s personality traits, sexual orientation, and even religion. The protagonist seeks a custom-made mod that will suspend his moral convictions long enough for him to murder his wife&#x27;s killer. In &quot;The Walk&quot;, an executioner offers his victim a mod that will cause him to accept the executioner&#x27;s personal philosophy, and thus help him cope with his death.

Neural mods feature prominently in Greg Egan&#x27;s first science fiction novel, &quot;Quarantine&quot;.

==The Jewel==

Two stories, &quot;Learning to Be Me&quot; and &quot;Closer&quot;, involve a different kind of neural implant called a &quot;jewel&quot;—a small computer inserted into the brain at birth that monitors its activity in order to learn how to mimic its behavior. By the time one reaches adulthood, the jewel&#x27;s simulation is a near-perfect predictor of the brain&#x27;s activity, and the jewel is given control of the person&#x27;s body while the redundant brain is discarded. In this way, people with the jewel can eliminate the cognitive decline associated with aging by implementing their minds on a machine. Also, by transplanting the jewels into cloned bodies genetically altered to develop without brains, they can live youthfully forever.

&quot;Learning to Be Me&quot; explores the consequences of a man&#x27;s jewel failing to synchronize with his brain, while in &quot;Closer&quot; a couple arranges to have the internal states of their jewels gradually made more similar so they can temporarily become a single person.

==Minds uploaded to computers==

Minds are transferred to computers in a different style in &quot;A Kidnapping&quot;. People wishing to upload themselves into computer simulations to avoid death are periodically scanned so that a recent copy of the individual can be simulated in the event of death. Due to limited computing resources, however, uploaded people are simulated slower than their physical counterparts, making communication between them difficult.

This system of uploading minds features prominently in Greg Egan&#x27;s novel &quot;Permutation City&quot;.

==Contents==

The collection consists of 18 stories from a number of sources:

* &quot;The Infinite Assassin&quot; – An illegal recreational drug allows people to travel between parallel universes with disastrous side effects.
* &quot;The Hundred-Light-Year Diary&quot; – After the invention of a method for sending messages back in time, history of the future becomes common knowledge, and every person knows their own fate.

* &quot;A Kidnapping&quot; – See notes above.
* &quot;Learning to Be Me&quot; – See notes above.
* &quot;The Moat&quot; – Sperm taken from a rape victim are found to contain DNA altered to be invisible to genetic testing.
* &quot;The Walk&quot;
* &quot;The Cutie&quot; – A man longing to be a father uses recent advances in biotechnology to impregnate himself with a &quot;Cutie&quot;, a child with sub-human mental capacities, sub-human legal status, and a lifespan of four years.
* &quot;Into Darkness&quot; – A giant sphere of unknown origin jumps between random locations on the Earth&#x27;s surface and restricts the movement of objects trapped inside in bizarre ways.
* &quot;Appropriate Love&quot; – A woman carries the brain of her severely injured husband inside her uterus for two years so that a new (brainless) body can be cloned to replace his.
* &quot;The Moral Virologist&quot; – Inspired by the AIDS epidemic, a fundamentalist Christian devotes his life to the creation of virus that will kill those he views as sexually immoral.
* &quot;Closer&quot; – See notes above.
* &quot;Unstable Orbits in the Space Of Lies&quot; – An unexplained event causes everyone on Earth to rapidly become ideologically sympathetic to people physically nearby, creating a world with clear geographic boundaries between religions and philosophies that cause instant conversion for those who travel between regions.

== Reception ==

=== Reviews ===
Danny Yee found that &quot;Axiomatic&quot; has &quot;more original ideas ... than [he&#x27;d] seen in a science fiction collection for ages, and anyone who likes hard science fiction will revel in them.&quot;

On the &quot;Epihyte Book review&quot; website Christina Schulman wrote, &quot;Egan&#x27;s ideas stretch your head the way the better cyberpunk does, without cyberpunk&#x27;s self-indulgent grime and alienation.&quot;

== Adaptations ==

The production of a short film inspired by the story &quot;Axiomatic&quot; commenced in 2015,and the film was released online in October 2017.

<text>Stacy Ann-Marie Keibler (born October 14, 1979) is an American retired professional wrestler, cheerleader, dancer, and model. She is best known for her tenure with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

Keibler began her professional wrestling career as a part of the Nitro Girls in WCW. She quickly moved on to a more prominent role in the company as the manager Miss Hancock. As Miss Hancock, Keibler was known for doing table dances, her relationship with David Flair, and a pregnancy angle. After WCW was purchased by the WWF (later WWE) in 2001, Keibler moved to the new company during the Attitude Era, using her real name and taking part in the Invasion storyline, also managing the Dudley Boyz. Keibler also managed Test and Scott Steiner. Before her departure from WWE in 2006, she was affiliated with The Hurricane and Rosey and nicknamed &quot;Super Stacy&quot;.

Keibler was a contestant on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;: season two, where she placed third. She has also appeared on other ABC series such as &quot;What About Brian&quot;, &quot;George Lopez&quot;, and &quot;October Road&quot;, as well as the 100th episode of the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; as a bartender and on the USA Network show &quot;Psych&quot;. Keibler has also modeled, appearing in both &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;Stuff&quot; magazines.

Keibler is considered to be a sex symbol and is known for her unusually long legs. She has been known as both &quot;The Legs of WCW&quot; and &quot;The Legs of WWE&quot;. During Keibler&#x27;s time on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, judge Bruno Tonioli nicknamed her &quot;The Weapon of Mass Seduction&quot;. Stacy Keibler was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on March 27, 2023.

== Early life ==
Stacy Ann-Marie Keibler was born on October 14, 1979, in Rosedale, Maryland, the daughter of Patricia and Gary Keibler. Beginning at the age of three, Keibler took ballet, jazz, and tap dancing classes at Jean Kettell Studio of Dance in Dundalk, Maryland. She went to St. Clement Mary Hofbauer School in Rosedale for her early schooling.

In 1990, Keibler won the title of Miss Maryland Pre-Teen, after competing for the title in Timonium, and went on to win the National Miss Pre-Teen Crown. After attending The Catholic High School of Baltimore, an all-girls school, she attended Towson University, where she studied mass communication. She attended the university on a partial scholarship and had a 3.7 grade point average (GPA). Keibler had minor parts in movies such as &quot;Pecker&quot; and &quot;Liberty Heights&quot;, as well as small modeling jobs. Keibler became a cheerleader for the Baltimore Ravens football team when she was 18.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== World Championship Wrestling (1999–2001) ===
Keibler began watching wrestling with her boyfriend at the time, Kris Cumberland. She can be seen in the crowd on an episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; in 1997 and the &quot;Starrcade&quot; 1998 pay-per-view before the television title match, dancing in an NWO Wolfpac T-shirt. In September 1999, Keibler entered a nationwide contest held by World Championship Wrestling to find a new member of the Nitro Girls dance troupe, which was organized in an attempt to boost the show&#x27;s declining ratings. A total of 300 women participated in the contest; the results were decided by a series of polls on WCW&#x27;s website, which narrowed down the field to eight finalists. Keibler was declared the winner of the contest on the November 8, 1999 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot; after receiving the most online votes out of the eight finalists and was given a spot on the dance troupe along with a $10,000 prize. Her winning routine was watched by 4.4 million viewers. Keibler performed dance routines every week on WCW&#x27;s flagship show &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; under the name Skye. By 2000, Keibler was appearing on WCW as a Nitro Girl, attending school full-time, and cheering for the Baltimore Ravens.

She soon accepted a larger role and became a heel valet using the stage name Miss Hancock (some weeks spelled &quot;Handcock&quot;), briefly serving as an associate for the tag team of Lenny Lane and Lodi dubbed Standards and Practices. Despite wearing business suits, her character was known to climb on top of the announcers&#x27; table and dance sensually. It was also during this period that she began using what would become her trademark ring entrance: slowly putting her forty-two inch legs through the second tier of ropes, pausing to let the crowd momentarily see her panties underneath her incredibly short skirts. At 5 feet 11 inches, Keibler was one of few women in professional wrestling tall enough to step over the middle of the three ropes that surround the ring.

During 2000, she dated David Flair (both on-screen and off-screen), who was already involved in an on-screen relationship with Daffney. Ms. Hancock set her eyes on Flair and ended up stealing him away from Daffney and continued to torment the woman whose boyfriend she stole, and the two would feud throughout the Summer of 2000. This led to Keibler&#x27;s in-ring debut at the Bash at the Beach in a Wedding Gown match, which she lost after she removed her own gown. Hancock next briefly feuded with Kimberly Page, but the storyline ended abruptly when Page quit the company. Keibler and Flair then began a feud with the Misfits in Action stable, including a mud wrestling singles match against Major Gunns at New Blood Rising. During the match, she was kicked in the stomach, and she revealed herself to be pregnant the next night, beginning a new angle for herself and Flair. Two proposed endings to the storyline were for either Ric Flair or Vince Russo to be the father of her child. The angle, however, ended prematurely, as she revealed the pregnancy to be false, broke up with David Flair, and was taken off of television.

When Stacy returned in 2001, she dropped the name Ms. Hancock and went by her real name. On the March 12, 2001 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Keibler revealed Shawn Stasiak as her &quot;baby&quot; and continued her role as a heel manager, siding with Stasiak. Shawn and Stacy would feud with Bam Bam Bigelow, with the evil Stacy using underhanded tactics to help Stasiak win 2 matches from a series of 3, including on the final edition of &quot;Nitro&quot; two weeks later on March 26.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (2001–2006, 2011–2023) ===

==== The Invasion (2001) ====

When WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2001, Keibler&#x27;s Time Warner contract was bought by the WWF. Stacy made her WWF television debut on the June 14, 2001 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when then-face, Shane McMahon brought her to the ring to distract then-heel, Rhyno, causing him to lose a match. Not long after this she turned into a heel character as part of The Alliance. Stacy showed herself to be an evil mean girl that had a sadistic side, as she loved watching other people&#x27;s pain and misfortune, and regularly enjoyed mocking them by pointing and laughing. She originally teamed up with real-life friend, then-heel, Torrie Wilson, and the pair feuded with Trish Stratus and Lita. During this feud the four wrestlers competed in the first-ever tag team Bra and Panties Match at the Invasion pay-per-view, which Trish and Lita won by stripping Stacy and Wilson down to their bra &amp; panties. After this she and Torrie moved on to targeting Jacqueline and were shown backstage enjoying watching Jacqueline cry over the elimination of Shadrick McGee from Tough Enough. Stacy and Torrie then defeated Jacqueline in a handicap match on &quot;Raw&quot; with help from Ivory. On the &quot;Heat&quot; before SummerSlam, Stacy along with Torrie and Ivory, brutally attacked Lita backstage by injuring her knee, with the intent of preventing her from competing against them later that night. Stacy also had a brief reunion with Shawn Stasiak, and a short alliance with Tazz, as they battled the likes of Spike Dudley and Tajiri. Stacy found it amusing how short these men were and told Torrie that their height made them lesser men. Torrie had begun dating Tajiri at this time and this caused the evil Stacy to begin an on-screen rivalry with her former friend. The feud started with a couple of mixed tag matches involving the women and included Stacy sneak attacking Torrie backstage on an episode of Raw.

==== Duchess of Dudleyville (2001–2002) ====
As the WCW/ECW Invasion was nearing its end, Keibler became the manager of the heel Dudley Boyz. She made her first appearance in this role on the October 1, 2001 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, and was nicknamed the &quot;Duchess of Dudleyville&quot;. During this time, Stacy continued to show her sadistic side as she took great pleasure in watching the likes of Torrie Wilson and Spike Dudley get driven violently through tables, and particularly enjoyed being the one to personally give the order to the Dudley Boyz to put Torrie through a table. Stacy couldn&#x27;t hide her joy at seeing Torrie suffering at her feet and laughed at the sight. A few days later on &quot;Smackdown&quot;, Stacy watched with glee as the Dudley Boyz threw Spike to the outside of the ring and through a table, as commentator Michael Cole acknowledged how wicked Stacy was and called her “evil”. Torrie would return a couple of weeks later to get her revenge and gave Keibler a wedgie then pantsed her on an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. She then defeated Keibler in the first-ever lingerie match, a match wrestled in lingerie, at No Mercy. Keibler made her WrestleMania debut at WrestleMania X8 alongside The Dudleyz. Keibler&#x27;s role with the Dudley Boyz came to an abrupt end during &quot;Raw&quot; after WrestleMania when she was powerbombed through a table after accidentally costing the team a match. She then set her sights on the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship at Judgment Day, facing Trish Stratus in a losing effort. She faced Stratus several more times in the succeeding weeks, but she never won a match against her.

==== Mr McMahon&#x27;s personal assistant (2002) ====
Keibler was originally drafted to the SmackDown! brand in 2002, where she immediately set her eyes on the man in charge, the heel WWE chairman, Vince McMahon. McMahon was ready to hire another attractive woman until Keibler interrupted and performed a seductive table dance in the ring to successfully become McMahon&#x27;s personal assistant, as well as his on-screen mistress. She was frequently shown flirting and &#x27;making out&#x27; with him in backstage segments. During her time alongside the boss she lied that the young rookie Randy Orton had forced himself on her, which caused Orton to be punished with a match against the mean veteran Hardcore Holly. A few weeks later she sat at ringside and enjoyed watching the rookie Orton get beaten up some more, this time by Test. She also had a personal ringside view when Triple H was ambushed in a 6 on 1 beatdown by some of McMahon&#x27;s henchmen. The sadistic Stacy looked on and grinned with pleasure as Triple H was beaten and bloodied in the assault. She also continued her rivalry with Torrie Wilson during this time period, and even tried to throw Torrie off the stage on an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, but a referee saved Torrie just in time and stopped Stacy&#x27;s evil plan from being a success. Her time with McMahon came to an end when Stephanie McMahon became general manager of the SmackDown! brand. Dawn Marie made her debut on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as McMahon&#x27;s legal assistant, who competed with Keibler for McMahon&#x27;s affections.

==== Move to Raw and alliance with Test (2002–2003) ====
A key storyline for Keibler&#x27;s on-screen character occurred when she left &quot;SmackDown!&quot; for &quot;Raw&quot;. Keibler made her official &quot;Raw&quot; debut on August 12, 2002, and immediately began feuding with the women there. She was given the role of being a special referee on a couple of occasions and used them as opportunities to abuse her power. Stacy liked counting quickly when her fellow bad girls were making pin attempts and counted slowly for the fan favorites. In another role as a special referee, Stacy was put in charge of a match between Test and D&#x27;Lo Brown. At the start of the match Stacy slapped D’Lo in the face and hindered his attempts to win the match with slow counts. After D&#x27;Lo argued with Stacy about her actions, he was smashed in the face by a big boot from Test, which Stacy thoroughly enjoyed watching. She then made a quick 3 count to help the villain Test win the match. This would begin the on screen pairing between her and Test which would last for the remainder of 2002 and most of 2003. She enjoyed watching him rip apart fan favourites, such as the superhero Hurricane and would also use her deviousness to help him win matches, such as when she delivered a low blow to Goldust.

As Test&#x27;s on-screen marketing agent, she came up with the idea that Test should call his fans &quot;Testicles,&quot; cut his hair, and reshape his image. This caused the gimmick to become popular with the audience and the couple switched from being villains into fan favorites in November 2002. This would be Stacy&#x27;s first time as a babyface in WWE. In the spring of 2003, Test, however, became to verbally abuse Keibler, who also started managing Scott Steiner. After months of build-up, Keibler finally left Test for Steiner on the June 2 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;. Steiner defeated Test for Keibler&#x27;s services at Bad Blood, and Keibler seemed happy as Steiner&#x27;s new manager, as the two alluded to having more than a professional relationship. Test, however, continued to harass Keibler and Steiner until Steiner accepted a rematch with Stacy&#x27;s services on the line. On the August 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Test won the match after faking a leg injury and then blindsiding Steiner with a big boot. A match was then set for Unforgiven with the stipulation that if Test won, he would not only retain Keibler&#x27;s services, but would acquire Steiner&#x27;s services as well. During the match, Keibler&#x27;s interference backfired, and Test won the match. Steiner then turned heel by attacking Keibler after her interference in his match on the September 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; backfired. For a time, Test and Steiner worked as a tag team, sharing the services of Keibler as their on-screen sex slave. The storyline finally ended on the December 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when general manager Mick Foley freed Keibler from her obligatory contracts with Test and Steiner by temporarily firing them.

==== Various storylines (2003–2005) ====
Keibler was chosen to record a track on the album &quot;WWE Originals&quot;. She and WWE music producer Jim Johnston recorded the song &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Just Dance?&quot; for the album. She was then placed in a feud involving Torrie Wilson and then-babyface, Sable, both of whom had recently posed for a &quot;Playboy&quot; cover. Keibler aligned with Miss Jackie, neither of whom had posed for the magazine, claiming that they deserved to be in &quot;Playboy&quot; over Sable and Wilson. Keibler and Jackie challenged Sable and Wilson to a Tag Team Evening Gown match at WrestleMania XX, which they lost when Jackie was pinned by Wilson, and the feud was dropped afterward. Before the feud was dropped, all the performers were playing face characters at the time.

She took over the 2004 Raw Diva Search for a few weeks, which led to several tag matches against the heel gimmicks of Gail Kim, Trish Stratus, and Molly Holly and with partners Nidia and the face gimmick of Victoria. Keibler got upset victories over Kim, Stratus, and Holly. She earned a Women&#x27;s Championship title match on October 11, 2004, but she was defeated by Stratus, who retained the title. Keibler also competed in the first-ever Fulfill your Fantasy Diva Battle Royal for the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship at Taboo Tuesday along with Victoria, Nidia, Gail Kim, Molly Holly, Jazz, and then-champion Stratus. She was eliminated second to last after jumping over the top rope to avoid hitting the turnbuckle, followed by Holly knocking her off the apron to eliminate her.

In February 2005, Keibler began appearing in backstage segments with then-babyface, Randy Orton, and eventually became his on-screen girlfriend. When Orton challenged The Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania 21, Orton ended the relationship by hitting Stacy with an RKO, incapacitating her. He justified it by claiming he was demonstrating how ruthless he could be in order to defeat The Undertaker.

==== Super Stacy (2005–2006) ====

Keibler then joined forces with The Hurricane and Rosey. She became one-third of the trio as a superhero sidekick nicknamed Super Stacy, complete with her own superhero costume. She was ringside during several matches as they defended their World Tag Team Championship. During this time, Keibler feuded on-screen with then-heel, Victoria, including confrontations and a mixed-tag-team match on &quot;Raw&quot; and a singles match on &quot;Heat&quot;.

After a long tenure on Monday nights, Keibler and Christy Hemme, were moved to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on August 25, as part of a trade that brought Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle to &quot;Raw&quot;. On &quot;SmackDown!&quot; Keibler participated in lingerie matches and bikini contests. After a short absence, Keibler began a short feud with Jillian Hall, which led to the two having a match on &quot;Velocity&quot;, which Keibler lost. This would be Keibler&#x27;s final match with WWE. Keibler then asked for time off to appear on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. During this time, Keibler&#x27;s WWE.com profile was moved from &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to &quot;RAW&quot;, though she never made an appearance on the brand before leaving the company. Keibler&#x27;s final mention on WWE programming occurred on the March 6, 2006 episode of &quot;RAW&quot;, where she was insulted by Candice Michelle for placing third on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; during Michelle&#x27;s unveiling of her &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine cover. After completing her stint on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, Keibler officially parted ways with WWE in July 2006 to move on to other endeavors.

==== Sporadic appearances and Hall of Fame induction (2011, 2019, 2023) ====
After leaving WWE in July 2006, Keibler made a special guest appearance for WWE&#x27;s reality show, &quot;Tough Enough&quot; in 2011. Being a former NFL Cheerleader, she helped prepare the contestants to perform publicly in Universal Studios.

On April 6, 2019, Keibler made a surprise return to induct Torrie Wilson into the WWE Hall of Fame. In 2021, WWE Network listed Keibler as one of the women who made an impact in WWE outside the ring. On March 15, 2023, Keibler was reported to be entering the WWE Hall of Fame, being confirmed on March 27, 2023. She was inducted by both Mick Foley and Torrie Wilson at the official ceremony ahead of WrestleMania 39, appearing with fellow inductees on-stage during the second night of the event.

== Modeling and acting career ==
As the Fitness Editor at &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine during 2005 and 2006, Keibler wrote and modeled for her own occasional column, Getting Fit with Stacy Keibler. She has appeared on the cover of that magazine twice -June 2005 and March 2006. &quot;Maxim&quot; named Keibler No. 5 in its 2006 Hot 100 issue, and No. 70 in its 2007 Hot 100. In 2008, she was named No. 89 in &quot;Maxim&quot;&#x27;s annual Hot 100 list.; the following year she was No. 77. In 2010, she was No. 82 and in 2011 she was No. 72. And in 2012 she was ranked 51.

Keibler starred in a commercial for AT&amp;T Corporation alongside Carrot Top. She also auditioned and earned a role in &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House 2&quot;, but she did not appear.

She competed in the second season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, alongside her dance partner, Tony Dovolani. Keibler received a perfect score of 30 from the three judges for her samba dance routine in week five. This prompted judge, Bruno Tonioli, to nickname her a &quot;weapon of mass seduction.&quot; Overall, Keibler and Dovolani received four perfect scores. Keibler was eliminated in the final episode, coming in third to Jerry Rice, who placed second in the final round of the competition, and Drew Lachey, the winner of the season. Two of the judges, Bruno Tonioli and Len Goodman, felt she should have at least placed second. Oddsmakers had considered her the favorite to win the competition.

Keibler has appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; twice. In season five Keibler took part in helping prank Triple H, which also included Stephanie McMahon. In season seven, however, Keibler was seen as a victim of a prank by her then-boyfriend, Geoff Stults.

<text>Luminous is a collection of short science fiction stories by Greg Egan first published in 1998 by Millenium.

==Contents==
&quot;Luminous&quot; contains the following short stories:

* &quot;Chaff&quot; — An agent is sent to kill a geneticist who is working on important brain-altering research in a drug lord-controlled stronghold in the jungles of Colombia.
* &quot;Mitochondrial Eve&quot; — An organization is trying to trace a common maternal ancestor for recent humanity.
*&quot;Luminous&quot; — A pair of researchers find a defect in mathematics, where an assertion (X) leads to a contradictory assertion (not X) after a long but finite series of steps. Using a powerful virtual computer made of light beams (Luminous), they are able to map and shape the boundary between the near-side and far-side mathematics, leading to a showdown with real consequences in the physical universe.

* &quot;Reasons to Be Cheerful&quot; — A boy discovers he has a serious brain tumor, which was causing him to be amazingly happy. With it removed, he becomes despondent, and undergoes a new and extensive treatment eventually, with a form of brain network, to try to get back to a more useful life many years later.
*&quot;Our Lady of Chernobyl&quot; — A man is hired to find a radioactive religious icon. The search turns deadly.
* &quot;The Planck Dive&quot; — Physicists about to undergo a one-way expedition into a black hole are visited by a stranger and his daughter.

==Critical reception==

Writing in &quot;Vector&quot; Brian Stableford noted: &quot;Egan&#x27;s second story-collection, &quot;Luminous&quot;, is markedly better than his first. Axiomatic, and warrants comparison with such classic collections of Contes philosophiques as Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinths&quot; and Primo Levi&#x27;s &quot;The Sixth Day&quot;...This is &quot;the&quot; science fiction book of the year, and it should be on every sf lover&#x27;s shelf...For good or ill, this is the shape of things to come.&quot;

In &quot;SF Commentary&quot; Bruce Gillespie noted: &quot;Greg Egan has achieved an evenness of texture and consistency of accomplishment in these stories that makes it difficult to remember them separately. They so nearly add up to one Eganworld that it’s hard to differentiate between their viewpoints. I’ve given four stars to most of them, and particularly liked &#x27;Transition Dreams&#x27;, &#x27;Silver Fire&#x27;, &#x27;Chaff&#x27;, and &quot;The Planck Dive&quot;.&quot;

<text>Tekax (from Mayan: Kʼáax), officially Tekax de Álvaro Obregón is a capital city of the municipality of the same name, located in the Mexican state of Yucatán. It has an average height of 37 m above sea level. n. m. and is located at a distance of 115 km from the state capital, the city of Mérida, 10 km from Akil, 18 km from Oxkutzcab and 34 km from Ticul.

== Place names ==
Tekax comes from Mayan: Teʼ place, there, there and kʼáax, jungle, mountain, (from Mayan: Teʼ Kʼáax &#x27;There in the jungle&#x27;)

== History ==
There are no exact data about the founding of the town, but it is known that in pre-Hispanic times the region belonged to the jurisdiction of the Tutul Xiu, until it was colonized by the Spaniard Alfonso López in the 16th century.
The region corresponding to the current municipality of Tekax is considered occupied since pre-Columbian times when the development of the Mayan culture began in the Puuc area; This is attested to by the archaeological sites of Chacmultún, Canahaltún, Chunmul, Xkichmook, Chacchob and Chunconab, which are examples of the Puuc style, although some with influence from the Chenes of Campeche.
The Xiues, leaders of the uprising that disintegrated the Mayapán coalition, came down from the southern mountain range and upon founding the town of Maní, they built other tributary towns to it, among which were Kax, built on the slopes of the aforementioned mountain range. The entire group made up the Tutul Xiu chiefdom with its main headquarters in Maní.
The Chilam Balam of Chumayel (version by Antonio Mediz Bolio) in its part corresponding to The Book of Lineages mentions: &quot;...and they went to Penkuyut, and they went to Paxuenel, and they arrived at Xaya, and they arrived at a place called Tistis , and they arrived at Chicam, and they arrived at Tixmehuac... when the names of the towns that did not have it were already complete, etc.&quot; It does not relate the city of Tekax, however, several of the towns mentioned are fully identifiable from the current municipality of Tekax.
In Yucatán, Indian repartitions took place in the years 1547 and 1548. The indigenous town of Kax was valued on February 9, 1549 in favor of Don Francisco Bracamonte and Valdivieso.
In 1823 Tekax received the title of Villa and in 1841 it obtained the title of city. However, in 1922 it was demoted to the category of town. In 1928 Tekax was named Ciudad Obregón by decree, but two years later the name was changed to Tekax de Álvaro Obregón.

<doc id="307290" wikidata="Q3266054" url="?curid=307290" title="Ludibrium">
<text>Ludibrium is a word derived from Latin (plural ), meaning a plaything or a trivial game. In Latin denotes an object of fun, and at the same time, of scorn and derision, and it also denotes a capricious game itself: e.g., (Virgil), &quot;the playthings of the winds&quot;, (Lucretius), &quot;the plaything of the waves&quot;; (Plautus), &quot;Until now you have been toying with me.&quot; 

The term &quot;ludibrium&quot; was used frequently by Johann Valentin Andreae (1587–1654) in phrases like &quot;the ludibrium of the fictitious Rosicrucian Fraternity&quot; when describing the Rosicrucian Order, most notably in his &quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot;, published anonymously in 1616, of which Andreae subsequently claimed to be the author and which has been taken seriously, as virtually a third of the Rosicrucian Manifestos. However, in his &quot;Peregrini in Patria errores&quot; (1618) Andreae compares the world to an amphitheatre where no one is seen in their true light. 

Paul Arnold translated Andreae&#x27;s usage as &quot;farce&quot;, but this conception has been contested by Frances Yates, who took Rosicrucianism seriously and who suggested that Andreae&#x27;s use of the term implied more nearly some sort of &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, a dramatic allegory played in the political domain during the tumult which preceded the Thirty Years&#x27; War in Germany.

Robert Anton Wilson has suggested that the Priory of Sion is a modern ludibrium:

The Priory of Sion fascinates me, because it has all the appearances of being a real conspiracy, and yet if you look at the elements another way, it looks like a very complicated practical joke by a bunch of intellectual French aristocrats. And half of the time I believe it really is a practical joke by a bunch of intellectual French aristocrats. And then part of the time I think it is a real conspiracy.

<doc id="307292" wikidata="Q659592" url="?curid=307292" title="René Duprée">
<text>René Goguen (born December 15, 1983), better known by his ring name René Duprée (; ) is a Canadian professional wrestler. He is currently signed to Pro Wrestling Noah where he is a former two-time GHC Tag Team Champion.

Goguen is best known for his tenure in World Wrestling Entertainment, where he is a one-time World Tag Team Champion with Sylvain Grenier as the tag team La Résistance and a one-time WWE Tag Team Champion with Kenzo Suzuki. He has also worked for Japanese promotions All Japan Pro Wrestling, Wrestle-1 and Hustle.

He is the first wrestler in WWE to win a title as a teenager. Goguen is the son of Canadian Maritimes wrestling promoter Emile Duprée.

==Professional wrestling career==

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2002–2007)===
====Ohio Valley Wrestling (2002–2003)====
In April 2002 Goguen signed with the World Wrestling Federation making him the youngest wrestler to sign with the WWF at the age of 18. On October 9, 2002, Goguen debuted under the ring name, René Duprée, after his father, defeating Johnny Jeter. Duprée would team up with various wrestlers in dark matches on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot;, while also competing in Ohio Valley Wrestling until April 2003.

====La Résistance (2003–2004)====

After weeks of vignettes airing, Sylvain Grenier and Duprée made their first appearance on the April 28, 2003, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as La Résistance by attacking Scott Steiner. Steiner had made remarks two weeks earlier comparing France to hell and Grenier and Duprée were offended. La Résistance went on to feud with Scott Steiner and Test, who was forced to be Steiner&#x27;s tag team partner by Stacy Keibler. La Résistance ended up defeating Steiner and Test at Judgment Day on May 18, 2003, in the team&#x27;s pay-per-view debut.

On June 15, 2003, La Résistance won the World Tag Team Championship from Kane and Rob Van Dam at Bad Blood, making Duprée the youngest wrestler in WWE history to not only win the World Tag Team Championship, but any championship in the company&#x27;s history at 19 years old. Also, as a result of winning the title, he was the first teenager in the history of the WWE that has won a championship. Duprée held on to this distinction until April 2018, when Nicholas won the WWE Raw Tag Team Championship at WrestleMania 34 at the age of 10.

The third member of La Résistance, Rob Conway, was originally introduced as an unnamed American serviceman being abused by Grenier and Duprée. On the August 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when The Dudley Boyz came out to attack La Résistance, they brought Conway into the ring with an American flag. Once the Dudley Boyz had their backs turned, Conway attacked the Dudley Boyz with the American flag and then tore it off the pole and laid it on top of them. Conway, now renamed to Robért Conway, joined Duprée and Grenier and the trio began carrying the French flag to ringside and singing the French national anthem before their matches. La Résistance lost the World Tag Team Championship to the Dudley Boyz at Unforgiven in a three-on-two handicapped tables match. The trio went on to feud with several tag teams, including the Dudley Boyz, The Hurricane and Rosey, and Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak.

In October 2003, Grenier suffered a back injury, resulting in Duprée and Conway holding the tag team together. At Armageddon, La Résistance competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship which was won by Ric Flair and Batista. At the Royal Rumble, Duprée competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match where he eliminated Matt Hardy before getting eliminated by Rikishi. At WrestleMania XX, La Résistance (Duprée and Conway) competed in a Fatal four-way tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles. Grenier returned in March 2004, thus reuniting the trio. The reunion did not last long, as Duprée was drafted to the SmackDown! brand in the 2004 WWE Draft Lottery on the March 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

====Championship pursuits (2004–2005)====

Duprée made his SmackDown! debut on the March 25, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, defeating Billy Kidman. He briefly had a talk show on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, called &quot;Cafe de René&quot;, but his only guest was Torrie Wilson as the segment was cancelled after only one night. Duprée wrestled Wilson to a draw on the April 29 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. For several months, pursued the United States Championship, held by John Cena. After an incident that happened during his &quot;Cafe de René&quot; (the same incident involving Torrie Wilson), Duprée challenged Cena to a championship match. The match was granted by SmackDown! general manager Kurt Angle and it took place at Judgment Day. Cena retained the championship at Judgment Day when he pinned Duprée after executing an &quot;F-U&quot;. At The Great American Bash, Duprée competed in a Four-way elimination match for the United States Championship which saw Cena retain once again.

After losing to Cena, he focused on the WWE Tag Team Championship and eventually won the title with Kenzo Suzuki by defeating Billy Kidman and Paul London on the September 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; (making him the youngest man to win the WWE Tag Team Championship at age 20). At No Mercy, Duprée and Suzuki defeated Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio to retain the WWE Tag Team Championship. They lost the WWE Tag Team Championship on the December 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to Van Dam and Mysterio. This match happened just days before Van Dam and Mysterio were to challenge Duprée and Suzuki at Armageddon. At Armageddon, Duprée and Suzuki lost to Van Dam and Mysterio in a rematch. At the 2005 Royal Rumble, Duprée competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Chris Jericho.

On the March 24, 2005, airing of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he was &quot;sacrificed&quot; by The Undertaker as a message to Randy Orton (regarding their match at WrestleMania 21), when The Undertaker interrupted a match between Duprée and Booker T. The result of the &quot;sacrifice&quot; saw Duprée receiving a &quot;Tombstone Piledriver&quot; on the steel steps which lead up to the ring. Duprée was taken off television after this, working dark matches until the April 28 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, where he was defeated by John Cena. Duprée went back to dark matches and a few &quot;Velocity&quot; matches until the June 18 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;, where Duprée came out calling himself &quot;The French Phenom&quot;, defeating Mark Jindrak via submission. The following week on &quot;Velocity&quot;, Duprée came out with a new look, sporting black trunks with his initials as well as jet black hair and a Dalí-styled goatee.

====Brand switches (2005–2007)====

On June 30, Duprée became one of the last minute trades in the 2005 WWE Draft Lottery, which saw him jump from SmackDown! back to Raw. On the July 4 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Duprée redebuted with his French Phenom gimmick and defeated Val Venis on the same night. Duprée began cutting promos using a new quote referring to himself as &quot;Simply Phenomenal&quot;. Duprée also began a winning streak against superstars such as The Hurricane, Matt Striker and Tajiri before suffering a near career-ending hernia in mid-September.

Once Duprée was cleared to wrestle, WWE sent him back to Ohio Valley Wrestling for training before returning to WWE. On October 19, 2005, Duprée returned to OVW facing Robert Fury in a no-contest. On February 21, 2007, La Resistance defeated Kofi Kingston and David Hart Smith in what would be Duprée&#x27;s final appearance in OVW.

On the August 8, 2006, episode of &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot;, a promo aired with Duprée, sporting a clean shave and long hair, announcing that he would be debuting for the ECW brand soon. Promos aired throughout the rest of August showing Duprée taking pictures, posing in mirrors, and working out, while claiming he is &quot;the most extreme athlete in ECW history&quot;. Duprée made his ECW debut on September 12, 2006, defeating Balls Mahoney. On the February 20, 2007, episode of &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot;, Duprée reformed La Résistance with Sylvain Grenier, but the team&#x27;s reunion was short-lived after Duprée was suspended at the start of March and sent to rehab after violating the Health and Wellness policy.

Duprée returned to the ring at WWE&#x27;s new developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling on June 26, 2007, and defeated Steve Madison. However, he was released from his WWE contract a month later on July 26, 2007, by his own request. In an interview with Chris Van Vliet in 2021, Duprée revealed the Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide was his main reason for leaving the company.

===Independent circuit (2007–2012)===

After leaving WWE, Goguen wrestled primarily on the European independent circuit and Japan. He made his debut for All Star Wrestling on January 25, 2008, defeating Mikey Whiplash. During his tenure at ASW, he formed a partnership with fellow French Canadian, Pierre Carl Ouellet. In March 2008, Duprée wrestled for Irish Whip Wrestling where he fought Mandrake for the IWW International Heavyweight Championship. In July 2008, he represented Europe in the Grand Prix Tournament. In September 2008, Duprée returned to Europe for several months where he won European Wrestling Promotion Royal Rumble and wrestled regularly for American Wrestling Rampage. In March 2009, Duprée defeated Rob Van Dam for the AWR No Limits Championship and would vacate it after two days when he was awarded the AWR Heavyweight Championship. On November 24, Duprée lost the AWR Heavyweight Championship to RVD in a best of two falls match but would regain the title on December 9. Duprée re-united La Resistance with Sylvain Grenier for AWR France 2010 Tour. After leaving AJPW, Duprée wrestled on the European independent circuit only and won the Southside Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat match. However his time in Europe came to an end when he returned to Canada.

On November 11, 2012, made his debut on the American independent circuit when Duprée lost to the Dynamic Sensation in a four corners match which also included Dan Maff and Devon Moore for Pro Wrestling Syndicate in Rahway, New Jersey. In May, Rene and his father restarted Grand Prix Wrestling and featured talent from All Japan Pro Wrestling and other assorted talent.

===Hustle (2007–2009)===

Goguen debuted for the Japanese promotion Hustle on August 15, 2007, under the name &quot;René Bonaparte&quot;, defeating fellow WWE alumnus Tajiri. After debuting, René became a member of President Nobuhiko Takada&#x27;s Takada Monster Army thus continuing his winning streak. Bonaparte and Wataru wrestled their grudge match was on September 22, with the stipulation being that Wataru&#x27;s wife, Eiko, was to become the wife of the winner of the match. Bonaparte defeated his tag team partner Sakata via disqualification, thus winning Eiko.

After a brief hiatus, Bonaparte made his return to the promotion in January 2008 and defeated Tajiri. His undefeated streak came to an end on January 17, when he and Giant Vabo lost to Tajiri and Kushida. In July 2008, he lost the first round of the Hustle GP to Toshiaki Kawada. Goguen debuted a new masked gimmick, Dina Sharp, and teamed with Mighty Sharp, this gimmick didn&#x27;t last long with them dropping the gimmick after only two shows. In April to May 2009, Bonaparte teamed with Lance Cade and stayed undefeated in tag team matches until they lost twice to Tajiri and Magnum Tokyo. In June, Bonaparte teamed with Travis Tomko as Armageddon, where Tomko was named Arma and Bonaparte was named Geddon. In July, Geddon turned on Arma and reverted to his René Bonaparte name before defeating Arma. Goguen wrestled his final match for Hustle on October 10, where his team lost a five-on-five tag team match.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2008, 2010–2011, 2013)===
On June 22, 2008, Goguen debuted for All Japan Pro Wrestling under his René Duprée ring name and defeated Manabu Soya. During his short stint in 2008 he aligned himself with the Voodoo Murders stable where he teamed up with TARU mostly.

On January 2, 2010, Duprée returned to AJPW and rejoined Voodoo Murders by filling in the final spot for a Voodoo Murders vs Gurentai tag team match which he lost, later on in the night he lost a seventeen-man battle royal. In April, he participated in 2010&#x27;s Champion Carnival, where he won only one match upon defeating Taiyō Kea. On September 20, 2010, Duprée and former tag team partner Kenso were defeated by Akebono and Taiyō Kea in a match for the World Tag Team Championship. From November 20 to December 7, Duprée teamed with TARU in the 2010 World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League, where they finished seventh in their bracket. On June 3, 2011, AJPW disbanded Voodoo Murders, suspended all of its Japanese members, including Duprée, and vacated all championships following the aftermath of a backstage fight between Yoshikazu Taru and Nobukazu Hirai, which resulted in Hirai suffering a stroke. In the aftermath of this, Duprée and former Voodoo Murders member Joe Doering stayed together as a tag team until the end of Duprée&#x27;s run with AJPW. At the joint pay-per-view All Together, which featured wrestlers from AJPW, Pro Wrestling Noah and New Japan Pro-Wrestling, Duprée participated in the Destroyer Cup battle royal, which was ultimately won by Kentaro Shiga.

During an AJPW international tour in Cocagne, New Brunswick, Canada on May 27, 2013, Duprée defeated Seiya Sanada to win the Gaora TV Championship. However, he returned the title to AJPW on September 11 after leaving the promotion to begin performing for Wrestle-1.

===Wrestle-1 (2013–2014, 2019–2020)===
While still officially the Gaora TV Champion, Duprée made a surprise appearance at the AJPW splinter promotion Wrestle-1&#x27;s inaugural event on September 8, 2013, teaming with Zodiac in a main event tag team match, where the two were defeated by Bob Sapp and Keiji Mutoh. Three days later, after Duprée had been announced for all future Wrestle-1 events, he returned the Gaora TV Championship to AJPW. During the October tour, Duprée joined Masayuki Kono&#x27;s Desperado stable. On March 2, 2014, Duprée took part in the big event, teaming with Desperado member Masayuki Kono and Samoa Joe losing to Rob Terry, Keiji Mutoh and Taiyō Kea in a six-man tag team match. On March 15, Duprée competed in a battle royal to determine the number one contender for the TNA X Division Championship, which was won by Seiki Yoshioka.

Duprée was due to return to Wrestle-1 on September 1, 2019, as part of the Pro Wrestling Love in Yokohama event but was unable to attend due to flight trouble. Enfants Terribles leader Shotaro Ashino announced that Duprée had joined the faction. On September 15, 2019, Duprée teamed with Ashino, Kuma Arashi and Yusuke Kodama in a losing effort. He teamed with Arashi in the 2019 Wrestle-1 Tag League, going undefeated in the round robin portion of the tournament before losing to T-Hawk and Shigehiro Irie in the final. Wrestle-1 financial issues meant Duprée would not return to the promotion and would eventually close on April 1, 2020.

===Return to the independent circuit (2015–2021)===
On January 24, 2015, Duprée made his first post Wrestle-1 appearance for the Canadian Wrestling Federation (CWF) defeating Tyson Dux.

On May 20, 2015, Duprée began touring with his father promotion Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling from May 2015 through August 2015. On April 29, 2017, Duprée defeated Hannibal to become the new GNW Canadian Champion as part of the 2017 AGPW tour in O&#x27;Leary, Prince Edward Island.

On May 26, 2017, Duprée competed for What Culture Pro Wrestling as part of their World Cup tournament where he was defeated by Michael Elgin due to disqualification in the first round of the Canadian qualifier.

On June 30, 2017, Duprée unsuccessfully defended his GNW Canadian Championship in a three-way elimination match against Wes Brisco and Hannibal, Brisco went on to win the championship.

On August 12, 2017, Duprée and Sylvain Grenier defeated Kryss Thorn and Scotty O&#x27;Shea to win the Canadian Wrestling Federation Tag Team Championship.

On February 9, 2018, Duprée debuted in Singapore Pro Wrestling (SPW) at SPW Repentless, but was defeated by &quot;The Statement&quot; Andruew Tang.

=== Pro Wrestling Noah (2020–2022) ===
Duprée signed with Pro Wrestling Noah as a member of Takashi Sugiura&#x27;s Sugiura-gun stable. He made his in-ring debut teaming with fellow Sugiura-gun member, El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr. to defeat Kenoh and Masa Kitamiya. Duprée and Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr. would enter in the Global Tag League, where they won by defeating AXIZ in the finals. On April 19, 2020, they defeated Naomichi Marufuji and Masaaki Mochizuki to win the GHC Tag Team Championship.

On July 26, 2020, it was announced that Duprée and Wagner Jr. vacated the GHC Tag Team Championships. On April 30, 2022, Duprée made his return after a near two year absence due to the COVID-19 pandemic teaming with Wagner Jr. defeating the team of Daiki Inaba and Masato Tanaka. On May 4, 2022, Duprée and Wagner Jr. defeated Takashi Sugiura and Hideki Suzuki to reclaim the GHC Tag Team Championships they previously were forced to vacate. On May 21, 2022, Duprée and Wagner Jr. lost the GHC Tag Team Championships to the team of Michael Elgin and Masa Kitamiya.

<text>Killarney ( ; , meaning &#x27;church of sloes&#x27;) is a town in County Kerry, southwestern Ireland. The town is on the northeastern shore of Lough Leane, part of Killarney National Park, and is home to St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Ross Castle, Muckross House and Abbey, the Lakes of Killarney, MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks, Purple Mountain, Mangerton Mountain, Paps Mountain, the Gap of Dunloe and Torc Waterfall. Its natural heritage, history and location on the Ring of Kerry make Killarney a popular tourist destination.

The town&#x27;s population was 14,412 as of the 2022 census, making it the second largest in the county. Killarney won the Best Kept Town award in 2007, in a cross-border competition jointly organised by the Department of the Environment and the Northern Ireland Amenity Council. In 2011, it was named Ireland&#x27;s tidiest town and the cleanest town in the country by Irish Business Against Litter.

==History==
===Early history and development===
Killarney featured prominently in early Irish history, with religious settlements playing an important part of its recorded history. Its first significantly historical settlement was the monastery on nearby Innisfallen Island founded in 640 by St. Finian the Leper, which was occupied for approximately 850 years.

Innisfallen (from Irish: &quot;Inis Faithlinn&quot;, meaning &quot;Faithlinn&#x27;s island&quot;) is an island in Lough Leane, one of the three Lakes of Killarney. It is home to the ruins of Innisfallen Abbey which was founded in 640 by St. Finian, and was occupied until the monks were dispossessed in 1594, by Elizabeth I, Queen of England. According to tradition, the Irish High King Brian Boru received his education at Innisfallen.

Aghadoe, the local townland which overlooks present day Killarney, may have begun as a pagan religious site. The site has also been associated with the 5th century missionary St. Abban, but 7th century ogham stones mark the first clear evidence of Aghadoe being used as an important site. According to legend, St. Finian founded a monastery at Aghadoe in the 6th or 7th century. The first written record of a monastery dates from 939 AD in the Annals of Innisfallen where the Aghadoe monastery is referred to as the &quot;Old Abbey.&quot;

Following the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, the Normans built Parkavonear Castle, also at Aghadoe. The castle was perhaps intended as an early warning outpost due to its views of the entire Killarney valley and lakes region.

Ross Castle was built on the lake shore in the late 15th century by local ruling clan the O&#x27;Donoghues Mor (Ross). Ownership of the castle changed hands during the Desmond Rebellions of the 1580s to the Mac Carty Mor.
Muckross Abbey was founded in 1448 as a Franciscan friary for the Observantine Franciscans by Donal McCarthy Mor. The abbey was burned down by Cromwellian forces under General Ludlow in 1654, and today remains a ruin.

Killarney was heavily involved in the Irish War of Independence. The town, and indeed the entire county, had strong republican ties, and skirmishes with the British forces happened on a regular basis.
The Great Southern Hotel was for a while taken over by the British, both as an office and barracks, and to protect the neighbouring railway station. One notable event during the war was the Headford Ambush when the IRA attacked a railway train a few kilometres from town.

However, divisions among former colleagues were quick to develop following the truce and treaty, and Killarney, like many other areas, suffered in the rash of increasing atrocities during the Civil War. A day after the Ballyseedy massacre, five Republican prisoners were killed in Killarney by Free State forces.

Killarney was granted town commissioners under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act 1854, which was converted to an urban district under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, and a town council under the Local Government Act 2001. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 dissolved the town council with the creation of Killarney Municipal District under the authority of Kerry County Council. Killarney Town Hall was erected in Kenmare Place in around 1930.
=== Tourism development ===

Killarney&#x27;s tourism history goes back at least to the mid 18th century, when Thomas, fourth Viscount Kenmare (Lord Kenmare), began to attract visitors and new residents to the town. The date of 1747 was used in recent 250-year celebrations to honour the history of Killarney tourism. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1861 gave the town some international exposure.

Killarney benefited greatly from the coming of the railway in July 1853. British trade directory publisher Isaac Slater noted that there were three hotels in the town in 1846 but by 1854, one year after the coming of the railway, James Fraser named seven hotels and described their locations:the Railway Hotel opposite the Railway Station; the Kenmare Arms and Hibernia which are on the main street and immediately opposite the church... the Victoria which is about a mile [1.5 km] to the west of the town on the shores of the Lower Lake; the Lake View which is about the same distance to the east of the town and also on the shore of the Lower Lake; the Muckross about two and a half miles [4 km] away and near the Muckross Lake and the Torc which occupies an elevated site about a mile and a half [2.5 km] from the town on the hill which rises immediately over the Lake Hotel.

In 1858, Irish born Victorian journalist, Samuel Carter Hall named O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s Hotel and the Innisfallen rather than the Hibernia and Torc, but Isaac Slater also named the Hibernia in 1846. At the time he was writing, tours of the Ring of Kerry were already an industry and Killarney was considered the starting point of the circuitous route. He was fascinated by the horses&#x27; endurance on the two-day trip, and leaves clear advice for other travellers; 

It is a common and wise custom of those who make this tour, and are not pressed for time, to hire the carriage at the hotel in Killarney and continue with it &#x27;all the way round.&#x27; It is absolutely marvellous what these mountain bred horses can get through &quot;thinking nothing&quot; of thirty miles [50 km] for days together or even fifty miles [80 km] in a single day.

As part of the trip, he noted that there were hotels in Glenbeigh and Waterville along with a &quot;comfortable inn&quot;, which is now the Butler Arms Hotel.

==Economy==
===Industry===
Thomas Browne, 4th Viscount Kenmare founded linen mills in the 1740s as part of his efforts to increase the population and economy of Killarney. In later years, hosiery and shoe making were major industries in the town. One such shoe factory was Hillards, which employed 250 people at its peak.

Modern employers include Liebherr Cranes, which has had a presence in Killarney since 1958, with a combined manufacturing/research and development facility in the town manufacturing container cranes. In honour of its founder, a street in Killarney was named Hans Liebherr Road. Other businesses include Tricel (also known as Killarney Plastics) which was founded in 1973.

In the public sector, both the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and Department of Justice have offices in Killarney.

===Tourism===
Tourism is the largest industry in Killarney, generating around €410 million every year. Roughly 1.1 million tourists visit the town every year, with foreign tourists making up over 60% of all visitors. 

In 2023, in a scheme intended to reduce litter volumes during the tourist season, Killarney became the first town in Ireland to ban single-use coffee cups.

==Transport==

Killarney is served by National Primary Route N22 (north to Tralee and Castleisland and east to Cork); the National Secondary Routes N72 (west to Killorglin and east to Mallow, Fermoy, and Dungarvan) and the N71 (south to Kenmare and Bantry).

==Sport==
===Association football===
The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the body that determines the Laws of the Game, met at the Lake Hotel in Killarney in 1905.

Killarney has three football clubs—all of which compete in the Kerry District League.

Killarney Athletic A.F.C. was founded in 1965, and played its first competitive game in the Desmond League as a youth team. It entered a junior team at the start of 1966. In the early 1970s, the club became a founding club of the Kerry District League (KDL). Originally the club played in the centre of Killarney, but have since moved to a modern facility (with two pitches) in the Woodlawn area of the town.

Killarney Celtic was founded in 1976. The club purchased their own ground in 1993 and have invested in their facilities since then. There is a grass pitch and a FIFA 1-star full-size synthetic all-weather pitch (both floodlit to match standard), a 50 x 80 meter grass training pitch and a 70 x 35 metre synthetic training pitch which is also fully floodlit.

Cedar Galaxy was formed in 2011 and play in the Kerry District League Division 2B. The team were promoted to Division 2A for the 2013/2014 campaign.

===Gaelic games===

The Kerry GAA branch of the Gaelic Athletic Association was founded in 1888. Kerry&#x27;s county hurling and county football teams play at the Fitzgerald Stadium in Killarney, which opened in 1936 and has capacity for 43,180 spectators.

Killarney has three Gaelic football clubs: Dr Crokes, Killarney Legion and Spa. The rural hinterland has a large number of football teams, such as Kilcummin, Fossa, Firies, Glenflesk and Gneeveguilla. All these teams compete in the Kerry County league and the East Kerry Senior Football Championship (O&#x27;Donoghue Cup) and league.

Dr. Crokes is the most successful of these teams, winning the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship in 1992 and the Munster Senior Club Football Championship in 1991, 1990 and 2007. The club has also won the County Championship on 7 separate occasions, including in 2010. Dr. Crokes is the only club in Killarney with a hurling team; it won the Kerry Intermediate Hurling Championship in 1999 and 2001.

===Rowing===
There are six rowing clubs in the town, who share a common history in Ireland&#x27;s oldest surviving regatta, the Killarney Regatta, which is held annually on the first or second Sunday in July. The six clubs are Commercial RC (Killarney), Flesk Valley RC, Fossa RC, Muckross RC, St. Brendan&#x27;s RC and Workmen RC. The style of rowing seen at the regatta is traditional, fixed seat rowing in wide, wooden six-person boats. Since the 1980s, a number of the clubs have moved toward coastal type rowing and modern &#x27;slide&#x27; or Olympic style rowing.

Muckross Rowing Club is the largest of the clubs, having developed into a full-time &#x27;sliding&#x27; club with 32 National Championships (since 1996) at various levels from Junior to Senior. A number of members of the club have also been selected to row for Ireland and have competed at the Home International Regatta, Coupe de la Jeunesse, World Rowing Championships and Olympic Games. Paul Griffin, Sean Casey and Cathal Moynihan members of Muckross Rowing Club, are Olympic and Irish World Championship rowers.

===Rugby===
Killarney RFC play in the Munster Junior League. The club&#x27;s 1st XV won promotion to Division 2 in 2009–10. while the same season the club fielded a 2nd XV for the first time. The club has also a large youth and underage set-up catering for all young enthuasists from the town and surrounding areas.

===Golf===
Killarney Golf &amp; Fishing Club attracts various national competitions such as the Irish Open.
The Ross Golf Course is a 9-hole golf course less than one mile from the centre of the town.

===Other sports===
Killarney Racecourse is located just outside the town and holds flat and national hunt meetings.

The Ring of Kerry Cycle, a charity cycle around the Ring (175 km) takes place every first Saturday in July. There is also a club in Killarney called Killarney Cycling Club.

St. Paul&#x27;s Killarney Basketball Club, founded in 1985, has entered both youth and senior teams in tournaments organised by Basketball Ireland. Killarney is also the home of Irish floorball.

==In popular culture and music ==
In 1900 the composer Cyril Rootham wrote his Op.8 &quot;Four Impressions (Killarney)&quot; for solo violin and small orchestra. The work was never published, but Rootham later arranged the work for pianoforte duet (Op.8 No.2, unpublished) and for violin and piano (Op.8.No.3, published in 1902 as &quot;Impressions pour Violon et Piano&quot;).

At the beginning of the 20th century, many songs which romanticized Ireland made direct mention of Killarney. Examples included &quot;My Father Was Born In Killarney - Don’t Run Down The Irish&quot; (1910), &quot;Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral&quot; (1914) and &quot;For Killarney and you&quot; (1910).

&quot;There&#x27;s Only the One Killarney&quot; is a song that was written by Irish songwriter Dick Farrelly and recorded by Irish tenor Patrich O&#x27;Hagan. Killarney also appears in &quot;How Can You Buy Killarney,&quot; written by Kennedy, Steels, Grant and Morrison, and recorded by Joseph Locke, among others. Killarney is also mentioned in &quot;Christmas in Killarney&quot; (written by Redmond, Cavanaugh and Weldon) and &quot;Did Your Mother Come From Ireland?&quot; (written by Kennedy and Carr), both most notably recorded by Bing Crosby. &quot;Some Say the Devil Is Dead&quot; by Derek Warfield contains the line &quot;Some say the devil is dead and buried in Killarney/ More say he rose again and joined the British Army.&quot;

Van Morrison references the town in the opening lines of his 1974 song &quot;Fair Play&quot; off of his album &quot;Veedon Fleece&quot;: &quot;&quot;Fair play to you / Killarney&#x27;s lakes are so blue / And the architecture I&#x27;m taking in with my mind / So fine&quot;.&quot;

Colin O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s 2013 novel, &quot;Killarney Blues&quot;, is set in the town and was awarded the &quot;Prix Mystère de la critique&quot; in 2018.

Though the present day office of the lieutenant governor in Quebec came into being only upon the province&#x27;s entry into Canadian Confederation in 1867, the post is a continuation from the first governorship of New France in 1627, through the governor generalcy of New France, and the governorship of the Province of Quebec. From 1786 to 1841, the Governors General of The Canadas simultaneously acted as the direct governor of Lower Canada, only occasionally appointing a lieutenant to act in their stead.

<doc id="307312" wikidata="Q231173" url="?curid=307312" title="Torrie Wilson">
<text>Torrie Anne Wilson (born July 24, 1975) is an American model, former fitness competitor and retired professional wrestler. She is best known for her tenure in WWE.

As a fitness competitor, Wilson won the Miss Galaxy competition in 1999. Shortly after, she was signed by World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where she stayed from 1999 until 2000. In 2001, she made her debut on World Wrestling Federation (WWF) television as part of The Invasion (by WCW, of the [then-] WWF) storyline. Her most high-profile storylines took place in 2002 when she feuded with Dawn Marie, and 2003 with Sable. Wilson has also been a part of the all-female stable (i.e., a group of storyline-associated characters), known as Vince&#x27;s Devils, which ended its run in 2006.

Aside from pro wrestling, Wilson has been on the cover of several magazines, including &quot;FHM&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;, which Wilson posed for twice, once along with Sable.

Wilson was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2019.

== Early life ==
Wilson was born in Boise, Idaho. She says that, while growing up, she was painfully shy. Wilson found her niche in many school activities, including cheerleading, dance, and track and field.

During her sophomore year of high school, after Wilson&#x27;s interest in modeling grew more serious, her mother urged her to pursue it. They visited an agency and were informed that Wilson would have to lose weight to be considered for jobs. In the process of losing weight, she began a bout with anorexia nervosa and then bulimia that lasted from ages 14-to-20.

After recovering from the disorder, Wilson became involved in fitness. She began eating six meals a day and working out. She placed third in her first competition, and she later won the Miss Galaxy competition in 1998. She then spent some time on the Extreme Fitness Team. As part of the Women&#x27;s Tri-Fitness Championships in 1998, Wilson won first place in the Grace and Physique round.

Later in 1998, Wilson moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. She began acting classes and was introduced to an agent who helped her gain a few jobs.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== World Championship Wrestling (1999–2000) ===
Wilson&#x27;s start in wrestling came when she attended a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) show with her boyfriend in 1999. After going backstage, she was asked to walk out to the ring with Scott Steiner. Later, Kevin Nash expressed an interest in doing a storyline with her. She first appeared on the February 8, 1999, episode of Nitro (later named &quot;Samantha&quot;). It was revealed, in the storyline, that Wilson was brought in by the New World Order (nWo) to seduce David Flair into turning against his father, Ric Flair. They appeared together on February 21 at SuperBrawl IX when Wilson slapped Ric, and David zapped him with a taser. After Ric won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from Hollywood Hogan at Uncensored inside a Barbed Wire Steel Cage match, David and Wilson took some time off from WCW television in April before returning in May, when Wilson would accompany David to the ring for matches. At the 1999 Bash at the Beach, Wilson acted as a valet for Flair as he successfully defended the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship against Dean Malenko.

She continued to accompany David to the ring until September when David was on the telephone with Wilson and later found out that Wilson was in the Filthy Animals&#x27; locker room flirting with Billy Kidman, which resulted in a feud between Flair and Kidman. On the October 18, 1999, episode of Nitro, Wilson turned on him, resulting in Flair losing the match and the Animals beating on him; after the Animals stopped assaulting David, Wilson left with the Filthy Animals. It was around this time that Wilson began managing Kidman and his Filthy Animals teammates. As a result, she found herself involved in the Animals continuing feud with The Revolution. On the November 22, 1999, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, during a tag team match between Kidman and Konnan facing Creative Control for the WCW World Tag Team Championship, Kidman looked up at the Turnertron and saw that Wilson and Eddie Guerrero were shown flirting inside his locker room on the &quot;Kidcam&quot;, a hidden camera segment, which led to a storyline feud between Kidman and Guerrero. Following this, Wilson once again disappeared from television. Wilson however returned on the January 19, 2000, episode of &quot;Thunder&quot; managing Kidman, and in April 2000, Kidman and Wilson joined a stable known as the New Blood, making them both villainous characters. As part of their newest storyline, Kidman became jealous of the attention Wilson began to give to fellow New Blood member Horace Hogan. In June, Wilson gave Kidman a hit at the Great American Bash, causing him to lose to Horace&#x27;s uncle, Hulk Hogan.

Wilson was taken off of television following the encounter, reappearing at July&#x27;s Bash at the Beach during a match between Shane Douglas and Buff Bagwell. After the match, Wilson and Douglas left together, which led to a feud between Kidman and Douglas. At September&#x27;s Fall Brawl, Wilson and Douglas defeated Kidman and Madusa in a mixed tag team match with scaffolding erected above the ring. Wilson was released from WCW in December 2000.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001-2008) ===
==== The Invasion and feuding with Dawn Marie (2001–2003) ====

Wilson made her television debut as a heel on the June 28, 2001, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as part of The Alliance during the Invasion angle in 2001. In her first storyline with the company, she portrayed Vince McMahon&#x27;s latest affair. She also regularly teamed with fellow WCW performer Stacy Keibler. The duo made their wrestling debuts in a Bra and Panties match against Lita and Trish Stratus at the InVasion pay-per-view, which Stratus and Lita won by stripping Keibler and Wilson to their yellow and white bikinis. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson defeated Stratus in a Paddle on a Pole match. Despite her relative lack of in-ring experience, Wilson, alongside Keibler and Ivory, regularly feuded with the Divas, as well as interfering in matches on behalf of other wrestlers in The Alliance.

She became a face during the Invasion storyline when her character began an on-screen romance with Tajiri. This new romance caused the evil Stacy Keibler to turn against Wilson, and as a result of this, Wilson defected to the WWF. Wilson defeated Keibler in the first lingerie match at No Mercy. When the first brand separation of the company roster took place in March 2002, Wilson was drafted to the SmackDown! brand. Shortly after this, as part of the storyline, Tajiri soon became jealous over the increased attention that Wilson received from other men, so he forced her to wear a geisha outfit, and he also appeared to mistreat her in matches. She depantsed Rico on the April 25, 2002, version of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Wilson finally grew tired of this, and during Tajiri&#x27;s match against The Hurricane, she got on top of the announcer&#x27;s table and stripped off her clothing. The distraction allowed The Hurricane to pick up the win. At Rebellion, Wilson and her real life boyfriend at the time Billy Kidman defeated John Cena and Dawn Marie in an intergender tag team match. After the match, Wilson and Kidman kissed. Wilson then got her first WWE Women&#x27;s Championship match on SmackDown! after Women&#x27;s Champion Molly Holly invaded the show interrupting Wilson&#x27;s photoshoot and challenging her to a match in which Wilson was unsuccessful in winning.

Wilson started a controversial feud with Dawn Marie in September 2002, in which Dawn would start a relationship with Wilson&#x27;s real-life father Al Wilson. On the October 17 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Wilson teamed up with Rikishi in a losing effort to the team of Dawn and Matt Hardy In response, Wilson defeated Dawn at No Mercy in October. Soon afterwards, Dawn would get engaged to Al, and told Wilson that she would break it off if she spent a night in a hotel room with her, though Dawn would later reveal this was a lie. Dawn would eventually show footage of this at Armageddon. The feud continued into 2003 when Dawn and Al got married on the January 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in their underwear. One week later, Al then, in storyline, died from a heart attack after having rigorous sex numerous times in succession on their honeymoon. Wilson defeated Dawn again to end the feud at the Royal Rumble in what was billed as a &quot;Stepmother vs. Stepdaughter match.&quot;

==== Playboy and various feuds (2003–2005) ====
In May 2003, Wilson appeared in a pictorial and on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. A few months earlier, when her pictorial was announced, a short storyline feud with Nidia developed, with the latter being jealous of the fact that Wilson was chosen for the cover and spread in the magazine. In weekly vignettes aired on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, both Nidia and her on-screen boyfriend Jamie Noble made trips to The Playboy Mansion to complain to Hugh Hefner over his choice. On the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; after WrestleMania XIX, during a segment labeled as Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Playboy Coming Out Party&quot; former Diva and &quot;Playboy&quot; covergirl Sable made her return to WWE after a four-year absence. This began a storyline between the two women where for weeks, Sable played mind games with Wilson, being friendly one moment and unfriendly the next. This all led up to a bikini contest between the two at Judgment Day, which Wilson won. After the contest, Wilson kissed the former Women&#x27;s Champion Sable on the lips, showing her that there were &quot;no hard feelings&quot; due to Wilson&#x27;s win over the WWE veteran. Continuing her feud with Noble and Nidia from earlier in the year, Wilson managed Billy Gunn upon his WWE return in the summer of 2003. The feud came to an end after Nidia and Noble both became fan favorites and sided with Gunn and Wilson. After the formation of this alliance, Wilson, Nidia, and Dawn Marie feuded with Shaniqua for a short period of time, which led to Shaniqua physically dominating Wilson and Nidia in a handicap match.
Wilson teamed with Sable in March 2004 to feud with &quot;Raw&quot; Divas Stacy Keibler and Miss Jackie. The feud&#x27;s storyline centered on the latter duo&#x27;s jealousy of Wilson and Sable as &quot;Playboy&quot; cover girls, as well as their recently being named cover girls yet again, as the two Divas were announced to be featured together in an upcoming &quot;Playboy&quot; March 2004 issue. After weeks of rivalry, Wilson and Sable defeated Keibler and Miss Jackie in a &quot;Playboy Evening Gown match&quot; at WrestleMania XX by stripping their opponents of their evening gowns. Wilson also wrestled Rene Dupree to a draw on the April 29 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. In May, Wilson began a second feud with Dawn. As part of the feud, the two had a match with Wilson&#x27;s career on the line when the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; General Manager at the time, Kurt Angle, made the stipulation for the match at Judgment Day, which Wilson defeated Dawn to keep her career. Later in the year, Wilson engaged in a short feud with Sable, who defeated her at The Great American Bash. On the July 1 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Sable was defeated by Wilson in a rematch. In November, Wilson began feuding with Hiroko. On the December 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Wilson teamed up with Rey Mysterio and Rob Van Dam in winning effort against Hiroko, Kenzo Suzuki and Rene Dupree.

On February 10, 2005, on a special episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; (recorded on February 4 in Saitama, Japan), Torrie defeated Hiroko in a kimono match by removing her kimono first. Torrie was then involved in a short-lived feud with MNM valet Melina. On July 24 at The Great American Bash, the two of them faced in a bra and panties match with Candice Michelle as the special guest referee, in which Wilson was defeated. A rematch between both of them took place on the July 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, where Melina was once again victorious.

==== Vince&#x27;s Devils (2005–2006) ====
It was revealed on August 22, 2005, that Wilson and Candice Michelle had been moved to the Raw brand as a part of a trade in exchange for Stacy Keibler and Christy Hemme. On that night, Wilson and Candice turned heel by attacking 2005 Diva Search winner Ashley Massaro. Her and Candice&#x27;s storyline feud with Massaro continued over the next couple weeks, as the duo, along with their enforcer Victoria (dubbed as the &quot;Skankateers&quot; by Trish Stratus), made things difficult for Massaro. On the September 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson defeated Massaro after interference from Victoria and Candice. Massaro evened the score on the September 12, 2005, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when she brought out the returning Stratus, and the duo proceeded to attack the heels. Later that night, Wilson teamed up with Victoria in a losing effort to Stratus and Massaro. This led to a tag team match at Unforgiven, where the team of Stratus and Massaro defeated Wilson and Victoria. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson was defeated by Stratus. After the match, Wilson, Victoria and Candice attacked Massaro and Stratus. The feud continued into &quot;WWE Homecoming&quot;, where Stratus and Massaro defeated Wilson, Candice, and Victoria in the first three on two Bra and Panties match by stripping all three of their opponents.

Wilson was absent from WWE television for quite some time after this, leading to rumors and false reports that she had been released from WWE. In actuality, she had taken a leave of absence to tend to some &quot;personal issues&quot;. Wilson was surprised by the rumors after some media personnel offered to help her find work. WWE issued a statement on their website, in which Wilson also commented, denouncing the rumors. In the statement, she joked she had to &quot;call the WWE office and ask them if they forgot to fire me&quot;.

On October 17, Wilson made her return to &quot;Raw&quot;, where she, Candice and Victoria faced off against the team of Stratus, Massaro, and their new ally Mickie James in a winning effort after Wilson pinned James. On the November 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson teamed up with Victoria and Candice Michelle in losing effort to Stratus, Massaro and James. On the February 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson was accompied by Candice in a losing effort to Massaro. Wilson soon turned face once again, after Candice and Victoria both turned against her. On the March 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson helped Stratus retain the Women&#x27;s Championship against Victoria who was accompanied by Candice. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson teamed up with Stratus to defeat Victoria and Candice. The storyline feud between Candice and Wilson led to a match where Wilson faced &quot;Playboy&quot;&#x27;s newest cover girl, Candice, at WrestleMania 22 in a &quot;Playboy Pillow Fight&quot;. Wilson won the match, but the feud still continued on-and-off for some time. On the June 12, 2006, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson defeated Candice in the first &quot;Wet and Wild match&quot;, a wrestling match involving water balloons and squirt guns, in which the winner of the match would be on the cover of the &quot;WWE 2006 Summer Special&quot; magazine.

==== On-screen relationship with Carlito (2006–2007) ====
Wilson also made a special appearance on WWE&#x27;s ECW brand on August 22, 2006, representing Raw in a bikini contest against ECW Diva Kelly Kelly. A winner was not decided, however, and a six-person mixed tag match began pitting Wilson, Tommy Dreamer, and The Sandman against the team of Kelly Kelly, Mike Knox, and Test. Wilson&#x27;s team was victorious.

In the final months of 2006, Wilson entered into an on-screen relationship with Carlito. On the November 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson participated in a #1 Contenders Diva Battle Royal that was won by Victoria. On the December 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson was defeated by Victoria and after the match Chris Masters proceeded to put Wilson in a Masterlock until she was saved by Carlito. During this time, Ric Flair took an interest in Carlito, and Wilson accompanied the duo in a series of tag matches. On the March 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson was defeated by then Women&#x27;s Champion Melina, after the match Melina attacked Wilson but was stopped by Mickie James, who was then stopped by Victoria, Melina then attempted to escape but was stopped by Ashley Massaro. In May 2007, however, Carlito turned against Flair and dumped Wilson when he became a heel. For laughing at Vince McMahon, he decided to put her in a match teaming up with Carlito, in which she lost on the June 4, 2007, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

==== SmackDown and retirement (2007–2008) ====
The storyline came to a halt when on the June 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson was drafted to the SmackDown! brand as part of the 2007 WWE Draft. As she returned, she acted as a valet for Jimmy Wang Yang and the duo was placed in feuds against Victoria and Kenny Dykstra.

At SummerSlam, Wilson participated in a number one contenders Battle Royal which was won by Beth Phoenix. On the September 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Wilson was one of the bridesmaids at the Theodore Long – Kristal Marshall wedding. On the September 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, after losing to Victoria, she was attacked in the ring by the debuting villainess Krissy Vaine, but the feud was prematurely dropped when Vaine left the company. On the October 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson competed in the Halloween Divas Battle Royal eliminating Victoria before being last eliminated by Kelly Kelly, who defeated her with a strike to the groin. On the November 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Wilson teamed up with Mickie James in a losing effort to Phoenix and Victoria. She was on James&#x27;s team at Survivor Series, which was victorious over Phoenix&#x27;s. Wilson&#x27;s last on-screen appearance was during the November 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, defeating long-time rival Victoria. In November, Wilson took time off from wrestling to undergo physical therapy in relation to a previous back injury. Torrie then made several final appearances as part of the company in February 2008, for autograph signings during the WrestleMania Fan Axxess tour – such as February 9 and 11. Following this, she took more time off. On May 8, 2008, Wilson was released from her WWE contract and she subsequently retired.

==== Sporadic appearances (2009, 2012, 2018) ====
Eleven months after her release, Wilson returned on April 5, 2009, at WrestleMania 25, competing on the 25-Diva Royal to crown Miss WrestleMania, which was won by Santina Marella. Wilson was shown in the audience at WrestleMania XXVIII with her then-boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez, of the New York Yankees.

On the January 22, 2018, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Wilson was honored being &quot;one of the greatest female superstars in the history of WWE&quot; and made a special appearance as part of the 25th anniversary of Raw along with fellow wrestlers and former co-workers; The Bella Twins, Maryse, Kelly Kelly, Lilian Garcia, Michelle McCool, Terri Runnels, Maria Kanellis, and fellow Hall of Famers Trish Stratus and Jacqueline.

While working for WWE, Wilson was on the road up to 300 days per year. She had a Maltese named Chloe, who traveled with her. While on the road, Wilson worked out at least four days a week. Usually, her workout consisted of an hour of cardiovascular workouts and a half-hour of lifting weights. Wilson also has a close friendship with Stacy Keibler. At one point, they were roommates in Los Angeles, California.

After dating for four years, Wilson married Peter Gruner, known on-screen as Billy Kidman, on July 11, 2003. They lived in Tampa, Florida when not traveling. The couple divorced in 2008.

In September 2007, Wilson launched her clothing line, &quot;Officially Jaded&quot;, alongside Nick Mitchell, a former WWE wrestler who was known as &quot;Mitch&quot; of the Spirit Squad. The couple began dating in mid-2006 while she was still married to Billy Kidman. She opened a store in The Woodlands, Texas, at the upscale Market Street district.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
Wilson&#x27;s wrestling style was technical, which included an arsenal of moves like dropkicks, clotheslines, suplexes, and pinning moves. Among her finishing and signature moves included the Nose Job which was a sitout facebuster, the swinging neckbreaker, DDT variations, a handspring back elbow (dubbed springboard elbow) and the stink face.

Her gimmick was that of the all-American glamorous and sexy girl next door who sometimes carried her female dog Chloe with her during matches. She was cited by WWE as being &quot;one of the most desired Divas during her seven years with WWE. And while she never held the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship, the former Miss Galaxy winner can lay claim to performing in one of the most downloaded matches in WWE.com history: a Bikini Contest against Sable from Judgment Day in 2003.&quot;

<doc id="307314" wikidata="Q136120" url="?curid=307314" title="Agave fourcroydes">
<text>Agave fourcroydes or henequen is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to southern Mexico and Guatemala. It is reportedly naturalized in Madeira, Italy, the Canary Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, Hispaniola, the Cayman Islands and the Lesser Antilles.

==Overview==

The leaves of &quot;Agave fourcroydes&quot; yield a fiber also called henequen, which is suitable for rope and twine but not of as high a quality as sisal. It is the major plantation fiber agave of eastern Mexico, being grown extensively in Yucatán, Veracruz, and Tamaulipas. It is also used to make &quot;licor del henequén&quot;, a traditional Mexican alcoholic drink.

The plant appears as a rosette of sword-shaped leaves 1.2 to 1.8 meters long, growing out of a thick stem that may reach 1.7 meters (5 ft). The leaves have regularly spaced teeth 3–6 mm long and a terminal spine 2–3 cm long.

Like sisal, &quot;A.fourcroydes&quot; is a sterile hybrid; the ovaries never produce seeds. The plant does produce bulbils that may be planted, but commercial growers prefer to use the frequent suckers, which develop more quickly.

The first person of Spanish descent to document the plant and its usefulness for ropes and other naval utensils was José María Lanz, a Mexican-born engineer in service of the Spanish Navy, who studied henequen in Yucatán in 1783.

==In mezcal==
Henequen, like other species of agave, is used in the production of mezcal.

<text>Sony Mobile Communications Inc. () was a multinational telecommunications company founded on October 1, 2001, as a joint venture between Sony Corporation and Ericsson. It was originally incorporated as Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, and headquartered in London, England, until Sony acquired Ericsson&#x27;s share in the venture on February 16, 2012.
On April 1, 2021, Sony integrated its electronics businesses including Sony Mobile into one company called Sony Corporation.

Prior to April 1, 2021, Sony Mobile exclusively created Android-powered smartphones under the Xperia sub-brand name; it also developed tablet computers (Sony Tablet), smartwatches (Sony SmartWatch) and fitness trackers (Sony SmartBand), alongside accessories and software for the devices.

Sony Mobile had research and development facilities in Lund, Sweden; Beijing, China; Tokyo, Japan; and San Francisco, United States. At its peak in 2007, Sony Ericsson, Sony Mobile&#x27;s predecessor, held a 9 percent global mobile phone market share making it the fourth largest vendor at the time. In 2017, Sony Mobile held less than 1% global market share but 4.8% in Europe and 16.3% in Japan.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Swedish company Ericsson had been making mobile cell phones since the 1980s, their first very handheld device being the Hotline Pocket introduced in 1987. In the United States, Ericsson partnered with General Electric in the early nineties as Ericsson Mobile Communications (ECS), primarily to establish a US presence and brand recognition. General Electric eventually left the joint venture.

Ericsson had decided to obtain chips for its phones from a single source—a Philips facility in New Mexico. On March 17, 2000, a fire at the Philips factory contaminated the sterile facility. Philips assured Ericsson and Nokia (their other major customer) that production would be delayed for no more than a week. When it became clear that production would actually be compromised for months, Ericsson was faced with a serious shortage. Nokia had already begun to obtain parts from alternative sources, but Ericsson&#x27;s position was much worse as production of current models and the launch of new ones was held up.

Ericsson, which had been in the mobile phone market for decades, and was the world&#x27;s third largest cellular telephone handset maker at the time behind Nokia and Motorola, was struggling with huge losses and decreasing market share. This was partly due to this fire as well as its inability to produce cheaper phones or fashionably-designed phones like Nokia managed to do. Speculation began about a possible sale by Ericsson of its mobile phone division, but the company&#x27;s president, Kurt Hellström, said it had no plans to do so. Hellström said, &quot;Mobile phones are really a core business for Ericsson. We wouldn&#x27;t be as successful (in networks) if we didn&#x27;t have phones&quot;.

Sony was a marginal player in the worldwide mobile phone market with a share of less than 1 percent in 2000. By August 2001, the two companies had finalised the terms of the merger announced in April. Ericsson contributed a majority of the Ericsson Mobile Communications company, excluding a minor part spun off as Ericsson Mobile Platforms. Sony contributed its entire handset division. The company was to have an initial workforce of 3,500 employees.

=== 2001 to 2010 ===

Sony Ericsson&#x27;s strategy was to release new models capable of digital photography as well as other multimedia capabilities such as downloading and viewing video clips and personal information management capabilities. To this end, it released several new models which had built-in digital camera and colour screen which were novelties at that time - examples include the Sony Ericsson T610, the P800 UIQ smartphone, and later the K700 handset. The joint venture continued to make bigger losses in spite of booming sales - however it paid off as Sony Ericsson made its first profit in 2003 and in the following years steadily increased handset sales. The joint venture was regarded to have been a success.
In 2005, Sony Ericsson introduced the K750i with a 2 megapixel camera, as well as its platform mate, the W800i, the first of the Walkman phones capable of 30 hours of music playback. Later in October 2005, Sony Ericsson presented the first mobile phone based on UIQ 3, the P990.

Also in 2005, Sony Ericsson agreed to become the global title sponsor for the WTA Tour in a deal worth $88 million US dollars over 6 years. The women&#x27;s pro tennis circuit was renamed the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour. Just over a month later on June 7, it announced sponsorship of West Indian batsmen Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan.

In 2007, the company&#x27;s first 5-Megapixel camera phone, the Sony Ericsson K850i, was announced followed in 2008 by the C905, the world&#x27;s first 8.1-Megapixel camera phone. At Mobile World Congress 2009, Sony Ericsson unveiled the first 12-Megapixel camera phone, named Satio.

On January 2, 2009, Sony Ericsson announced in Stockholm that it would have some of its mobile phones made in India, and that its two outsourcing partners, Flextronics and Foxconn would manufacture ten million mobile phones per year by 2009. CEO Miles Flint announced at a press conference held with India&#x27;s communications minister Dayanidhi Maran in Chennai that India was one of the fastest growing markets in the world and a priority market for Sony Ericsson with 105 million users of GSM mobile telephones.

Sony Ericsson&#x27;s handset shipments fell from a high of 30.8m in Q4 1999 to only 8.1m in Q1 2003. The company had made net losses in six of the 15 quarters and seen its cash reserves shrink from €2.2bn to €599m, after taking a €375m cash injection from its joint owners. The eclipse of the Symbian operating system, initially by Apple&#x27;s iPhone, and then by Google&#x27;s Android, has affected Sony Ericsson&#x27;s position in the market. The company also struggled following the launch of Apple&#x27;s iPhone in the third quarter of 2007.
Sony Ericsson was overtaken by its South Korean rival LG Electronics in Q1 2008. Sony Ericsson&#x27;s company&#x27;s profits fell significantly by 43% to €133 million (approx. US$180 million), sales falling by 8% and market share falling from 9.4% to 7.9%, despite favourable conditions that the handset market was expected to grow by 10% in 2008. Sony Ericsson announced another profit warning in June 2008 and saw net profit crash by 97% in Q2 2008, announcing that it would cut 2,000 jobs, leading to wide fear that Sony Ericsson was on the verge of decline along with its struggling rival, Motorola. In Q3 the profits were much on the same level, however November and December saw increased profits along with new models being released such as the C905 being one of the top sellers across the United Kingdom.

In June 2008, Sony Ericsson had about 8,200 employees, it then launched a cost-cutting program and by the end of 2009 it had slashed its global workforce by around 5,000 people. It has also closed R&amp;D centres in Chadwick House, Birchwood (Warrington) in the UK; Miami, Seattle, San Diego and RTP (Raleigh, NC) in the USA; The Chennai Unit (Tamil Nadu) in India; Hässleholm and Kista in Sweden and operations in the Netherlands. The UIQ centres in London and Budapest were also closed, UIQ was a joint venture with Motorola which began life in the 1990s.

=== 2011 to 2020 ===
On October 27, 2011, Sony announced that it would acquire Ericsson&#x27;s stake in Sony Ericsson for €1.05 billion ($1.47 billion), making the mobile handset business a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony. The transaction&#x27;s completion was expected to occur in January 2012. At their keynote at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show, Sony&#x27;s Kaz Hirai announced that Sony Ericsson would be known simply as Sony Mobile Communications pending completion of the transaction. On January 26, 2012, the European Union approved the buyout. On February 16, 2012, Sony announced it had completed the full acquisition of Sony Ericsson. On January 7, 2013, Sony Mobile completed moving its headquarters from Lund, Sweden to Tokyo, Japan in order to fully integrate with its parent company. The first Sony-only mobile was the Sony Xperia S at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show. In May 2012, Sony Mobile Communications announced that it would phase out all the feature (non-smart) phones in favor of &quot;smartphones&quot; by September 2012.

Sony Mobile was the fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer by market share in the fourth quarter of 2012 with 9.8 million units shipped.

On July 2, 2012, Sony announced it was buying Gaikai, a cloud service to support its expansion into the cloud gaming realm. Sony paid a reported $380 million to acquire Gaikai. The Sony Ericsson Liquid Energy Logo, which was the hallmark logo used on Sony Mobile products up until the 2012 series of phones, was replaced with a new power button designed as the new signature hallmark to easily identify a Sony phone and this debuted with the 2013 series of Xperia mobile phones. The last phones to feature the Liquid Energy logo were the Sony Xperia T and Sony Xperia TX, and the first phones without featuring it were the Sony Xperia J and Sony Xperia V. Both were unveiled at the IFA 2012. At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show the Sony Xperia Z and Sony Xperia ZL were announced, followed by the Sony Xperia Z1, unveiled during a press conference in IFA 2013, the Sony Xperia Z2 during the 2014 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, and the Sony Xperia Z3 in IFA 2014.

On October 30, 2014, Sony announced that Senior Vice President of Corporate Planning, Finance and New Business Creation Department Hiroki Totoki will replace Kunimasa Suzuki as president and CEO of Sony Mobile Communications with effect from November 16, 2014. Suzuki subsequently became the Group Executive of Sony Corporation after his departure from Sony Mobile Communications.

In the last quarter of 2015, Sony Mobile had the highest per-handset-profit and average selling price of all major Android handset manufacturers. However, in terms of market share, Sony Mobile dropped out of the top 10 smartphone vendors globally for the first time in the first quarter of the year.

Sony Mobile has been the only major smartphone OEM that has given support to developing communities of smaller, hacker-focused mobile operating systems during this time. In 2013 Sony released an experimental Firefox OS ROM for the Sony Xperia E device. In 2017 Sony got Sailfish OS into its Open Devices program. As a result, the Sailfish software has been officially ported to many Xperia devices.

As of Q2 2018, Sony Mobile&#x27;s smartphone market share in Japan was 12.5%, behind Apple and Sharp.

On March 26, 2020, Sony announced that it will establish an intermediate holding company &quot;Sony Electronics Corporation&quot; effective April 1, 2020. Sony Electronics Corporation will incorporate the three businesses that comprise its Electronics Products &amp; Solutions (&quot;EP&amp;S&quot;) segment (Imaging Products &amp; Solutions, Home Entertainment &amp; Sound, and Mobile Communications) and related global sales and marketing, manufacturing, logistics, procurement and engineering platforms.

== Operations ==

In 2009, Sony Ericsson announced that it was moving its North American headquarters from Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, to Atlanta. The headquarters move was part of a plan to reduce its workforce, then 10,000 employees, by 20%. As of that year, Sony Ericsson had 425 employees in Research Triangle Park; the staff had been reduced by hundreds due to layoffs. Stacy Doster, a spokesperson of Sony Ericsson, said that the proximity to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport&#x27;s flights to Latin America and the operations of AT&amp;T Mobility influenced the decision to move the USA headquarters. Sony Ericsson will close the Research Triangle site. On August 23, 2012, Sony announced heavy cuts of their work force in Lund, Sweden. In September 2014, Sony announced taking a €1.3 billion impairment charge on the Sony Mobile division and cutting another 15% of jobs - equivalenting about 1000 employees - at Sony Mobile.

== Products ==

=== Sony Ericsson smartphones ===
Sony Ericsson (originally Ericsson) was part of the Symbian Ltd. consortium and supported the UIQ pen-based touch interface for Symbian OS. The first Sony Ericsson UIQ smartphone was the Sony Ericsson P800 in 2002. Sony Ericsson joined the Symbian Foundation in 2008 and soon UIQ Technology went bankrupt - the Sony Ericsson Satio was released in 2009 running on Symbian^1, which would be succeeded by Sony Ericsson Vivaz in 2010. For the Japanese market, Sony Ericsson also produced Linux and Symbian-based MOAP handsets for NTT DoCoMo, as well as REX OS for au/KDDI.

Sony Ericsson launched their first Windows Mobile device in 2008, the Xperia X1, at the 2008 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, which carried the Windows Mobile operating system with a Sony Ericsson panel interface and was manufactured by HTC. They would further develop two more Windows Mobile devices: Sony Ericsson Xperia X2 and Sony Ericsson Aspen in 2010. By this time, Sony Ericsson switched all its focus on Google&#x27;s Android operating system. The company&#x27;s CEO did confirm a Sony Ericsson Windows Phone device called &quot;Jolie&quot; for 2011. A prototype exists and was leaked on the internet in 2011, but no Windows Phone device was ever released.

There was also a line of BRAVIA-branded clamshell smartphones that were released for the Japanese market between 2007 and 2010.

Since 2012 all products by Sony Mobile have been in the Xperia range and running the Android OS - the Xperia X10 model launched in 2010 was the first to feature this. In 2011 Sony Ericsson carried a range of mid and high-end Android smartphones all using the same SoC, only differentiating in form factor, screen size and multimedia capabilities. Although in 2012 the phones already carried the Sony brand on them, they were still (mostly) developed by Sony Ericsson, as can be seen from the green logo on the back of handsets like the Xperia S and Xperia T.

=== Sony smartphones (Xperia) ===
The line-up in 2013 brought an entirely different design of phones, first seen on the Xperia Z smartphone, and called &#x27;OmniBalance&#x27; (roughly translated as &#x27;balance everywhere&#x27;) by Sony. In 2014 Sony stated to be focusing more on the high-end phone market and reducing the number of low and mid-end products. The first model launched in 2015 was the Xperia Z3+, featuring updated internals in a body similar to the Xperia Z3.

In 2016, Sony introduced the Xperia X series at MWC 2016 to replace the Z series. The last device to launch under the Xperia X series was the Xperia XZ3, a flagship device released in late-2018 featuring an OLED display, a first for Sony smartphones, then it got replaced by the number series introduced on the Xperia 1 in 2019.

=== Wearables ===

Sony (then Sony Ericsson) has been making Bluetooth enabled watches from as early as 2006. In 2010 the LiveView smartwatch was launched, featuring a colour OLED display that let the user view notifications and control the music player. Its successor was the Sony SmartWatch in 2012, of which two newer revisions have been made since.

In 2014 a fitness tracking band, named SmartBand, was introduced. The device&#x27;s data is accessed using an Android application named Lifelog, which presents statistics about their everyday activities. In 2015, a successor to the SmartBand was introduced, named SmartBand 2, which can track user&#x27;s heart rate, movements, sleep, and the moments they are calm or excited.

=== PlayStation Certified ===
In 2011, Sony Ericsson announced the first PlayStation Certified phone, the Xperia Play which meant that it had access to PlayStation Mobile games. The previously released Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc and Xperia acro became the next PlayStation Certified devices followed by the Sony Xperia S, Xperia ion and other Sony Tablets.

=== Applications ===
Sony Mobile offers a wide range of applications, ranging from music and videos to camera and gaming apps. Some of Sony Mobile&#x27;s most popular apps include:
*Cinema Pro - premium video recording application co-developed with CineAlta engineers.
*Photo Pro - a photography app that gives you Alpha-like manual controls.
*Game Enhancer - makes gameplay much more convenient with various functions. 
*Lifelog - activity tracking and fitness app designed for Android devices.
*PlayStation Video - online film and television programme distribution service that first was offered by Sony Entertainment Network.

*The Walkman-branded W series music phones, launched in 2005. The Sony Ericsson W-series music phones were notable for being the first music-centric series mobile phones. A notable feature was a &#x27;W&#x27; button, which when pressed opens the media centre.
*The Cyber-shot-branded line of phones, launched in 2006 in newer models of the K series phones. This range of phones are focused on the quality of the camera included with the phone. Cyber-shot phones always include a flash, some with a xenon flash, and also include auto-focus cameras. Sony Ericsson kicked off its global marketing campaign for Cyber-shot phone with the launch of &#x27;Never Miss a Shot&#x27;. In February 2008, the series was expanded with the announcement of C702, C902 and C905 phones.
*The UIQ smartphone range of mobiles, introduced with the P series in 2003 with the introduction of P800. They are notable for their touchscreens, QWERTY keypads (on most models), and use of the UIQ interface platform for Symbian OS. The range was subsequently expanded with the M series and G series.
*The GreenHeart range - first introduced in 2009 with the Sony Ericsson J105i Naite and C901 GreenHeart. Focused on an environmentally friendly theme, it mainly used eco-friendly materials and featured eco-apps.

== Marketing campaigns ==

=== &quot;I love&quot; ===
On October 2, 2006, Sony Ericsson adopted a new corporate and advertising identity inspired by I Love New York in which the circular Sony Ericsson icon is placed instead of a heart meaning &quot;love&quot;. This would then be followed by words, initially simple ones such as &quot;music&quot; or &quot;photography&quot; and later by for instance &quot;my hip hop loud&quot; or &quot;life captured&quot;. The branding was designed by the Wolff Olins consultancy. The campaign lasted until 2009 when it was replaced by multicoloured Sony Ericsson icons using Sony&#x27;s slogan &quot;make.believe&quot;.

=== Social media ===
During 2010, in 11 months, Sony Ericsson&#x27;s Facebook fan count rose from 300,000 to 4 million to become the 40th-largest brand on the social networking site. The company aims to capitalise on this fanbase and increase engagement by profiling these fans and matching them to dedicated content. It will also analyse the top commenters on the Facebook page and ensure engagement through special content and offering these fans the chance to visit Sony Ericsson offices.

=== Sports sponsorship ===

From 2007 to 2014, Sony Ericsson / Sony Mobile sponsored the Sony Ericsson Open tennis tournament in Miami. According to the head of global marketing partnerships, Stephan Croix, “our sport sponsorships allow us to promote our phones in a subtle and authentic way to our fanbase. Our promise to fans is to enrich their experience during the game but also before and after.” Sony Ericsson Open was renamed to Sony Open Tennis in 2013.

Sony Mobile sponsored the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and was a former partner of the UEFA Champions League.

<text>The Prohibition Party (PRO) is a political party in the United States known for its historic opposition to the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages and as an integral part of the temperance movement. It is the oldest existing third party in the United States and the third-longest active party.

Although it was never one of the leading parties in the United States, it was once an important force in the Third Party System during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The organization declined following the enactment of Prohibition in the United States but saw a rise in vote totals following the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1933. However, following World War II it declined, with 1948 being the last time its presidential candidate received over 100,000 votes and 1976 being the last time the party received over 10,000 votes.

The party&#x27;s platform has changed over its existence. Its platforms throughout the 19th century supported progressive and populist positions including women&#x27;s suffrage, equal racial and gender rights, bimetallism, equal pay, and an income tax. The platform of the party today is progressive on economic issues in that it supports Social Security and free education, but is conservative on social issues, such as supporting temperance and advocating for a consistent life ethic. The Prohibition Party advocates for environmental stewardship.

==History==

===Foundation===

In 1868 and 1869, branches of the International Organisation of Good Templars, a global temperance organization, passed resolutions supporting the creation of a political party in favor of alcoholic prohibition. From July 29 to July 30, 1868, the sixth National Temperance Convention was held in Cleveland, Ohio, and passed a resolution supporting temperance advocates to enter politics. On May 25, 1869, the Good Templars branch in Oswego, New York, called a meeting to prepare for the creation of a political party in favor of prohibition. Jonathan H. Orne was chosen as chairman and Julius A. Spencer as secretary of the meeting and a committee consisting of John Russell, Daniel Wilkins, Julius A. Spencer, John N. Stearns, and James Black was created to organize a national party.

On September 1, 1869, almost five hundred delegates from twenty states and Washington, D.C., met at Farwell Hall in Chicago and John Russell was selected to serve as the temporary chairman and James Black as president of the convention. The party was the first to accept women as members and gave those who attended full delegate rights. Former anti-slavery activist Gerrit Smith, who had served in the House of Representatives from 1853 to 1854 and had run for president in 1848, 1856, and 1860 with the Liberty Party nomination, served as a delegate from New York and gave a speech at the convention. The organization was referred to as either the National Prohibition Party or the Prohibition Reform Party.

===Early===

On December 9, 1871, a national convention was called for February 22, 1872, to nominate a presidential and vice presidential candidate. Chairman Simeon B. Chase, U.S. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, Gerrit Smith, Mayor Neal Dow (a former mayor of Portland, Maine), and John Russell were proposed as presidential nominees while Henry Fish, James Black, John Blackman, Secretary Gideon T. Stewart, Julius A. Spencer, and Stephen B. Ransom were proposed for the vice presidential nomination. Black and Russell were given the presidential and vice presidential nominations. The first platform of the organization included support for alcoholic prohibition, the direct election of Senators, bimetallic currency (based on silver as well as gold), low tariffs, universal suffrage for both men and women of all races, and increased foreign immigration.

In 1876, the organization&#x27;s name was changed to the National Prohibition Reform Party. However, in 1881, Frances Willard, R. W. Nelson, A. J. Jutkins, and George W. Bain formed the Home Protection Party, which was more pro-women&#x27;s suffrage than the Prohibition Party, but later rejoined the party at the 1882 convention and the organization was renamed to the Prohibition Home Protection Party. However, at the 1884 national convention the organization was renamed to the National Prohibition Party.

===Rise===
In 1879, Frances Willard became the president of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union and although it had remained non-partisan in the 1876 and 1880 presidential elections, Willard advocated for a resolution under which the organization would pledge its support to whichever party would support alcoholic prohibition. Willard&#x27;s attempts in 1882 and 1883 were unsuccessful, but she was successful in 1884 after her opponents left to join Judith Foster&#x27;s rival Non-Partisan WCTU. During the 1884 presidential election the organization sent its resolution to the Republican, Democratic, Greenback, and Prohibition parties and only the Prohibition Party accepted. At the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union&#x27;s 1884 national convention in St. Louis the organization voted 195 to 48 in favor of supporting the Prohibition Party and would continue to support the Prohibition Party until Willard&#x27;s death in 1898.

During the 1884 election, the party nominated John St. John, the former Republican governor of Kansas, who, with the support from Willard and the WTCU, saw the party poll 147,482 votes for 1.50% of the popular vote. However, the party was accused of spoiling the election due to Grover Cleveland&#x27;s margin of victory over James G. Blaine in New York being less than John&#x27;s vote total there. In 1888, the party&#x27;s presidential nominee, Clinton B. Fisk, was accused of being a possible spoiler candidate that would prevent Benjamin Harrison from winning, but Harrison won the election even though he lost the national popular vote.

From January to February 1892, Willard met with representatives from the Farmers&#x27; Alliance, People&#x27;s Party, National Reform Party, and the remainder of the Greenback Party in Chicago and St. Louis in an attempt to create a fusion presidential ticket, but the organizations were unable to agree to a platform. The People&#x27;s Party would later fuse with the Democratic Party in the 1896 presidential election.

The party suffered a schism at the 1896 Prohibition convention between the &quot;narrow gauger&quot; faction which supported having only an alcoholic prohibition plank in the party&#x27;s platform and the &quot;broad gauger&quot; faction which supported the addition of free silver and women&#x27;s suffrage planks. After the narrow gaugers successfully chose the presidential ticket and the party platform, the broad gaugers, led by former presidential nominee John St. John, Nebraska state chairman Charles Eugene Bentley, and suffragette Helen M. Gougar, walked out and created the breakaway National Party, nominating a rival ticket with Bentley as president and James H. Southgate as vice president. The Prohibition party ticket of Joshua Levering and Hale Johnson had the worst popular vote performance since Neal Dow&#x27;s 10,364 votes in 1880, but still outperformed the National Party&#x27;s 13,968 votes. Following the 1896 election most of the members of the National Party became disillusioned with that party and returned to the Prohibition Party, but those who remained reformed into the Union Reform Party and supported Seth H. Ellis and Samuel Nicholson during the 1900 presidential election, while the official Prohibition Party ticket of John G. Woolley and Henry B. Metcalf took 1.5% and third place in the national popular vote.

At the same time, the Prohibition Party&#x27;s ideology broadened to include aspects of progressivism. The party contributed to the third-party discussions of the 1910s and sent Charles H. Randall to the 64th, 65th, and 66th Congresses (1915–21) as the representative of California&#x27;s 9th congressional district; on April 6, 1917, Randall was one of 50 representatives who voted against U.S. entry into World War I. Democrat Sidney J. Catts of Florida, after losing a close Democratic primary, used the Prohibition line to win election as Governor of Florida in 1916; he remained a Democrat.

During the 1916 presidential election, the party attempted to give its presidential nomination to former Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, but he declined the offer via telegram. At the national convention the presidential nomination was given to former Indiana Governor Frank Hanly, but an attempt to make his nomination unanimous was defeated by Eugene W. Chafin, who had served as the presidential nominee in 1908 and 1912, and had supported giving the nomination to former New York Governor William Sulzer. Virgil G. Hinshaw wrote to John M. Parker in an attempt to fuse the Prohibition and Progressive parties, but it failed; the Progressives did not nominate a presidential candidate and later disbanded.

On February 4, 1918, the Prohibition affiliate in California voted in favor of merging with the National Party, which was created by pro-war defectors from the Socialist Party of America in 1917.
===Decline===

On January 16, 1919, the Eighteenth Amendment, which prohibited &quot;intoxicating liquors&quot; in the United States, was ratified by the requisite number of states. Although it was suggested that the organization should be disbanded due to national alcoholic prohibition being achieved, the committee leaders changed the focus of the organization to support the enforcement of prohibition. In 1921, the organization petitioned for any non-citizens who violated the Eighteenth Amendment to be deported and for citizen violators to lose their right to vote. At the 1924 national convention the party approved a platform with only two planks, namely, supporting religion in public schools and the assimilation of immigrants.

During the 1928 presidential election, some members of the party, including Chairman D. Leigh Colvin and former presidential nominee Herman P. Faris, considered endorsing Republican Herbert Hoover rather than running a Prohibition candidate and risk allowing Al Smith, who supported ending prohibition, to be elected. However, the party chose to nominate William F. Varney due to its feeling that Hoover was not strict enough on prohibition, although the affiliate in California gave Hoover an additional ballot line and in Pennsylvania the affiliate did not file presidential electors. However, the party became critical of Hoover after his victory, and during the 1932 presidential election D. Leigh Colvin stated that &quot;The Republican wet plank, supporting the repeal of Prohibition, means that Mr. Hoover is the most conspicuous turncoat since Benedict Arnold.&quot; Hoover lost the election, but national prohibition was repealed in 1933, with the 21st Amendment during the Roosevelt administration.

===Post World War II===

In 1950, when the party was $5,000 in debt, Gerald Overholt was selected to be the party&#x27;s chairman. During the 1952 presidential election, Overholt and Stuart Hamblen, the presidential nominee, spent $70,000 and the party&#x27;s debt was increased to $20,000. During the 1954 elections, the affiliates in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Indiana, and Michigan lost their ballot access although the party remained successful in Kansas, where the Prohibition sheriff of Jewell County was reelected, and in California, where the attorney general nominee received over 200,000 votes.

In 1977, the party changed its name to the National Statesman Party, but Time magazine suggested that it was &quot;doubtful&quot; that the name change would &quot;hoist the party out of the category of political oddity&quot; and it changed its name back to the Prohibition Party in 1980.

The Prohibition Party experienced a schism in 2003, as the party&#x27;s prior presidential candidate, Earl Dodge, incorporated a rival party called the National Prohibition Party in Colorado. An opposing faction nominated Gene C. Amondson for president and filed under the Prohibition banner in Louisiana. Dodge ran under the name of the historic Prohibition Party in Colorado, while the Concerns of People Party allowed Amondson to run on its line against Dodge. Amondson received 1,944 votes, nationwide, while Dodge garnered 140.

One key area of disagreement between the factions was over who should control payments from a trust fund dedicated to the Prohibition Party by George Pennock in 1930. The fund pays approximately $8,000 per year, and during the schism these funds were divided between the factions. Dodge died in 2007, allowing the dispute over the Pennock funds to finally be resolved in 2014. The party is reported as having only &quot;three dozen fee-paying members&quot;.

In 2015, the party rejoined the board of the Coalition for Free and Open Elections and became a qualified political party in Mississippi. In the 2016 election, the party nominated James Hedges and qualified for the ballot in three states, Arkansas, Colorado, and Mississippi; he earned 5,514 votes becoming the most successful Prohibition presidential candidate since 1988.

The party met via telephone conference in November, 2018 to nominate its 2020 presidential ticket. Bill Bayes of Mississippi, the vice presidential nominee during the 2016 presidential election, was given the nomination on the first ballot over Adam Seaman and Phil Collins. C.L. Gammon of Tennessee was given the vice presidential nomination without opposition. Bayes resigned as the nominee, accusing some party activists of sabotaging his run because they opposed his views. Another telephone conference call was held, during which Gammon was given the presidential nomination and Collins was given the vice presidential nomination. However, Gammon withdrew from the nomination in August 2019 due to health problems, and another telephone conference was held that selected Collins for the presidential nomination and Billy Joe Parker for the vice presidential nomination. In 2024, the party nominated businessman Michael Wood for President, and John Pietrowski for Vice President.

<doc id="307320" wikidata="Q1541747" url="?curid=307320" title="National Republican Party">
<text>The National Republican Party, also known as the Anti-Jacksonian Party or simply Republicans, was a political party in the United States which evolved from a conservative-leaning faction of the Democratic-Republican Party that supported John Quincy Adams in the 1824 presidential election.

Known initially as [[John Quincy Adams|Adams]]-[[Henry Clay|Clay]] Republicans in the wake of the 1824 campaign, Adams&#x27;s political allies in Congress and at the state-level were referred to as &quot;Adams&#x27;s Men&quot; during his presidency (1825–1829). When Andrew Jackson became president, following his victory over Adams in the 1828 election, this group became the opposition, and organized themselves as &quot;Anti-Jackson&quot;. The use of the term &quot;National Republican&quot; dates from 1830.

Henry Clay was the party&#x27;s nominee in the 1832 election, but was defeated by Jackson. The party supported Clay&#x27;s American System of nationally financed internal improvements and a protective tariff. After the 1832 election, opponents of Jackson, including the National Republicans, Anti-Masons and others, coalesced into the Whig Party.

== History ==
Before the election of John Quincy Adams to the presidency in 1825, the Democratic-Republican Party, which had been the only national American political party for over a decade, began to fracture, losing its infrastructure and identity. Its caucuses no longer met to select candidates because now they had separate interests. After the 1824 election, factions developed in support of Adams and in support of Andrew Jackson. Adams politicians, including most ex-Federalists (such as Daniel Webster and Adams himself), would gradually become members of the National Republican Party; and those politicians that supported Jackson would later help form the modern Democratic Party.

After Adams&#x27;s defeat in the 1828 election, his supporters regrouped around Henry Clay. Now the &quot;anti-Jackson&quot; opposition, they soon organized as the National Republican Party. Led by Clay, the new party maintained its historic nationalistic outlook and desired to use national resources to build a strong economy. Its platform was Clay&#x27;s American System of nationally financed internal improvements and a protective tariff, which would promote faster economic development. More important, by binding together the diverse interests of the different regions, the party intended to promote national unity and harmony. 

Historians refer to the National Republican Party, but the term Anti-Jackson was frequently used at the time. For instance in 1830, Alexander McIlhenny recorded in his diary, &quot;May 29th: I attended the Anti Jackson meeting at Sultzers in Taney Town. Addressed a few words to the meeting.&quot;

The National Republicans saw the Union as a corporate, organic whole. Hence, the rank and file idealized Clay for his comprehensive perspective on the national interest. Conversely, they disdained those they identified as &quot;party&quot; politicians for pandering to local interests at the expense of the national interest. The party met in national convention in late 1831 and nominated Clay for the presidency and John Sergeant for the vice presidency.

===Formation of the Whig Party===
The Whig Party emerged in 1833–1834 after Clay&#x27;s defeat as a coalition of National Republicans, along with Anti-Masons, disaffected Jacksonians and people whose last political activity had been with the Federalists a decade before. In the short term, the Whig Party formed with the help of other smaller parties in a coalition against President Jackson and his reforms.

==History==
===Early years===
NOLS was founded in 1965 by Paul Petzoldt, a mountaineer and a member of the Army&#x27;s 10th Mountain Division, with the backing of three affluent Lander residents (Ed Breece, legislator and Petzoldt&#x27;s brother-in-law; Jack Nicholas, legislator; and William Erickson, physician). Breece, Nicholas, and Ericson formed the nucleus of the early board of trustees. Petzoldt was also an early Outward Bound Chief Instructor, and he wanted to establish a school which promoted concentrating on refining outdoor leadership skills.

The first facility opened in 1965 in Lander, Wyoming at Sinks Canyon. June 8, 1965 marks the date of the founding and the first trip beginning at the trailhead of Hidden Valley Ranch where 100 male students went into the Wind River Range. In the beginning, NOLS struggled with finances to provide necessities for outdoor trips, so Petzoldt and his early team developed the “uniform” made of Salvation Army donations. The school began to grow in the early years and in 1966, women were allowed to enroll. In 1967, the adventure courses began for young boys aged 13–15.

In 1971, the administrative offices were moved to downtown Lander, Wyoming, where NOLS is still based today. NOLS has facilities in Alaska, Washington, Arizona, Utah, New York, Idaho, Chile, Mexico, Canada, New Zealand, the Yukon Territory, Tanzania, Scandinavia, and India. It also runs wilderness medicine courses in a variety of other locations around the world.

===&quot;30 Days to Survival&quot;===
NOLS grew during the 1970s, due to the publicity gained by an appearance on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Alcoa Hour&quot;. The episode, titled &quot;30 Days to Survival,&quot; followed a NOLS course as they traveled through the Wind River Range. The school&#x27;s focus became more ecological; conservation and preservation began to rank with leadership training in terms of emphasis. As a result of the airing, the school&#x27;s enrollment grew from 250 students in 1969 to over 750 in 1970. The school also gained publicity in December 1969 from the Life magazine article, “Last Mountain Man? Not If He Can Help It,&quot; which featured the school and Paul Petzoldt. The school&#x27;s growth continued; by the end of 1976, NOLS had 40 instructors and from 1976 to 1977, had enrolled 1,523 students.

===1980s to today===
NOLS partnered with the University of Utah to offer college credit for courses, and helped create the U.S. Leave No Trace program. In 1989, NOLS adopted an outcome-based education model. In 1999, NOLS acquired the Wilderness Medicine Institute. NOLS also began to offer professional training to corporate and institutional clients, including NASA.

In the summer of 2001, the crew of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; completed a 12-day, 50-mile expedition in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming with NOLS Professional Training.

In the summer of 2013, NOLS designed, developed, and led Expedition Denali, the first team of African Americans to attempt to summit Denali (Mount McKinley), the United States’ highest peak at 20,320 feet. The summit attempt was not successful due to weather conditions, but the outreach work that NOLS and Expedition Denali members did before and after the expedition expanded the awareness of organizations and individuals about people of color engaging in the outdoors and in providing youth of color with role models to pursue their own outdoor interests. A film, &quot;An American Ascent&quot;, was made throughout the expedition and has been shown in film festivals and schools around the country as well as the White House on July 3, 2015. Author James Edward Mills wrote &quot;The Adventure Gap&quot;, a book chronicling the expedition as well as the history of African Americans in the outdoors in the United States.

NOLS is notable as a pioneer of diversity in the traditionally white-male dominated field of outdoor adventure education. With their Vision 2020 plan, the organization has committed themselves to building a diverse community, both among staff and students, by reaching out and supporting underrepresented groups. As of 2021, NOLS offers expeditions for People of Color, those who identify as LGBTQ+, and women. Additionally, NOLS offers scholarship opportunities and fellowship programs in order to allow individuals who might not normally participate in outdoor adventure programing to do so.  

==Curriculum==

===Leave No Trace National Program===
The Leave No Trace National Program began in the 1960s as the USDA Forest Service looked for ways to help people take care of the public lands they were visiting in increasing numbers. In the early 1990s NOLS partnered with the Forest Service on the program. 1994 marks the founding of the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics, a non-profit organization.

The principles of Leave No Trace concern minimizing the social and environmental impacts that have led to ecological degradation. The program serves as an education tool to provide guidance for how to behave while camping in the backcountry. The seven principles are: 
# Plan ahead and prepare.
# Travel and camp on durable surfaces.
# Dispose of waste properly.
# Leave what you find.
# Minimize campfire impacts.
# Respect wildlife.
# Be considerate of other visitors.”

===NOLS Wilderness Medicine===
Founded by Melissa Gray and Buck Tilton in Pitkin, Colorado in 1990 as a western branch of Stonehearth Outdoor Learning Opportunities (SOLO), the Wilderness Medicine Institute (WMI) was purchased by NOLS in 1999. It is now known as NOLS Wilderness Medicine.

The school maintained its headquarters in Pitkin, Colorado, until the summer of 2002, at which point the offices and administrative staff moved to Lander, WY, and into the newly finished NOLS international headquarters. In January 2007, WMI entered into a partnership with Landmark Learning of Cullowhee, NC in order to provide wilderness medicine courses in the American southeast. Then, in 2010 WMI entered into a partnership with REI Co-op to offer wilderness medicine courses through the REI Outdoor School (now REI Experiences).

===Leadership===
Leadership education is the hallmark of NOLS&#x27; curriculum. NOLS uses four roles and seven skills as a framework to define ideal leadership characteristics. The curriculum&#x27;s goal is to push students to use leadership skills and teamwork to rise up to challenges faced while on remote, backcountry excursions. The four roles of leadership are: designated leadership, active followership, peer leadership, and self leadership. The seven skills of leadership are: expedition behavior, vision and action, communication, judgement and decision-making, self-awareness, tolerance for adversity, and competence.

Expedition behavior refers to having a positive attitude, respect for others, an awareness of the needs of other group members, and a willingness to place group needs above individual ones. NOLS teaches that it is only through good expedition behavior that groups can successfully collaborate to achieve goals that would be impossible for an individual to achieve on his or her own. All NOLS courses rely on expedition behavior as the underlying basis for successful cooperation.

Competence is the mastering of wilderness skills and potential for personal growth and to gain more knowledge. Communication involves effectively communicating interpersonally and with the group on both verbal and nonverbal levels. Judgment and decision-making involve making decisions that benefit the group, given unique circumstances, both externally and internally to the group. Tolerance for adversity and uncertainty refers to being flexible to various challenges, and being able to respond in a calm, concise, effective manner. Leadership should keep the positive attitude and work through the issues in a responsible manner. Self-awareness is defined as the skill to realize, interpret, and respond to one&#x27;s own personal needs, as well as recognizing strengths and weaknesses, and compensating for them accordingly. This skill is imperative in the backcountry because it empowers the individual to take responsibility for his or her health. Taking care of their safety and health is important to being able to function properly and making strong decisions. Vision and action refers to having the initiative to lead a group and seeing the possibilities for moving the group toward a goal.

===Outdoor skills===
Skills taught on NOLS courses include backpacking, canoeing, caving, climbing, fly-fishing, horsepacking, mountaineering, rafting, river kayaking, sailing, sea kayaking, skiing, snowboarding, etc. Students gain insight into how to choose equipment, clothing, and how to feed themselves in the outdoors. They learn that proper hygiene is essential to prevent illnesses. Leave No Trace principles show students how to travel in the outdoors with minimum impact.

===Environmental studies===
Throughout the courses students learn about Leave No Trace principles and practice them. Students gain insight into the history of their location by reading about and discussing the plants, animals, geology, etc. of their surroundings. Students delve into the environmental issues around the area and humans&#x27; environmental ethics regarding the topics.

===Risk management===
Risk management is a part of the curriculum and plays a large role in how the school approaches new course areas and course types. In the field, risk management revolves around self-care, preventing injury, and handling risky situations. Students learn about proper foot care and body temperature regulation. Judgment and group decision making is taught through experience leading daily travel and through targeted classes. Classes include a framework for classifying objective and subjective risks encountered in the wilderness with an emphasis on making thoughtful decisions. Emergency procedures are put into place and taught to all students in case a student or staff member is injured or lost.

Additionally NOLS, along with Outward Bound USA and the Student Conservation Association, sponsors the Wilderness Risk Management Conference.

===Hazards===

Encountering bears is a concern in the Wind River Range. There are other concerns as well, including insects, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures.

Importantly, there have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue. The U.S. Forest Service does not offer updated aggregated records on the official number of fatalities in the Wind River Range. There also was an additional presumed death in 1999, where the student, Thomas Nazzaro&#x27;s body, was never recovered.

<text>Louvain-la-Neuve (, French for &quot;New Leuven&quot;; ) is a planned town in the municipality of Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, Wallonia, Belgium, situated 30 km southeast of Brussels, in the province of Walloon Brabant. The town was built to house the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) which owns the entire territory of the town; following the linguistic quarrels that took place in Belgium during the 1960s, and Flemish claims of discrimination at the Catholic University of Leuven, the institution was split into the Dutch language Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven), which remained in Leuven, and the Université catholique de Louvain.

To a great extent, it still lives following the rhythms of the university that is its . However, with the construction of &quot;L&#x27;Esplanade&quot; shopping complex, the &quot;Aula Magna&quot; exhibition centre and auditorium, a large cinema complex, and five museums, it is beginning to grow beyond its academic roots.

==History==

===Language crisis===
Louvain-la-Neuve was born as a result of the Leuven Crisis, which led to the split of the Catholic University of Leuven. Following the elections prompted by this affair, the expansion of the French-speaking part of the Catholic University of Leuven was voted upon and approved on 18 June 1968. A few weeks later, the separation was made official. It resulted in the creation of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven), the Dutch-speaking university, that would stay in Leuven, and the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), which had to move to the future site of Louvain-la-Neuve, except for the French-speaking medical faculty, which moved to Woluwe-Saint-Lambert (often called &quot;Louvain-en-Woluwe&quot;), in the suburbs of Brussels. The first blueprints of Louvain-la-Neuve were made in a hurry and under dramatic times.

===Construction===
After much deliberation, the university administration agreed on a building site near the town of Ottignies, in the French-speaking part of the Province of Brabant (today&#x27;s Walloon Brabant). They bought a 9 km2 plot of beetroot farmland, which became the site from which the new town would arise. Construction started on 20 January 1969.

Put under the direction of Raymond M. Lemaire, Jean-Pierre Blondel and Pierre Laconte, this urbanistic project saw the first students and inhabitants arrive in 1972. At this time, there were only around 600 permanent residents of the town, who were joined during the day by some students of Applied Sciences, the first faculty to open. With the completion of university buildings and the ongoing residential development, the town experienced rapid growth, with 10,477 inhabitants recorded in 1981. The final goal is to reach 30,000 inhabitants, in addition to the 15,000 students living in town during the academic year.

The town was created with the sole purpose of hosting the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain). As such all the grounds are property of the university. Consequently, the university was able to play an important role in the conception and planning of the town. They decided that the town should not be only inhabited by students, but rather draw a diverse community as is found in any classic town. Moreover, one of the main points of the urban design of Louvain-la-Neuve was to make it people- rather than automobile-centred. As a consequence, the town centre is built on a gigantic concrete slab, with all motorized traffic travelling underground. This allows most of the ground level of the town centre to be car-free. Most buildings are built on the slab (&quot;la dalle&quot;), and the pedestrian area is expanding even far from the town centre featuring many mixed use overpasses and traffic calming solutions. This constitutes an early example of the 15-minute city, with the Agora, Main square and train station in a tight central triangle reachable by foot within 15 to 20 minutes from the outermost districts.

==Description==
The town is clustered around this center in four districts: &quot;Biéreau, Lauzelle, Hocaille&quot; and &quot;Bruyères&quot;. A fifth district, &quot;Baraque&quot;, that was not planned by the university has expanded on the north side of the town. It is distinct from the rest of the town in the willingness of its inhabitants to live outside of the common architectural framework (small cobblestoned and pedestrian streets) used in the other parts of the town.

Louvain-la-Neuve&#x27;s location south of Brussels at the crosspoint of several important roads makes it easily reachable by car. Moreover, a train extension has been built from the nearby station of Ottignies, which allows passengers to travel to or from Brussels in under an hour.

Louvain-la-Neuve is now a thriving, growing town. Construction work is constant as many more of the characteristic small two to five floor buildings made of red bricks are erected.

Due to the large student population that leaves the town during weekends and holidays, Louvain-la-Neuve can be quite empty during those periods. Nevertheless, the student life both day and night is well developed, centered around Student Unions, &quot;project flats&quot; (&quot;kot-à-projet&quot;), regional pubs, etc.

==The &quot;24 heures vélo&quot;==
Celebrating its 40th edition in 2017, the &quot;24 heures vélo&quot; (24-hour bike ride) is the biggest student party in Belgium. The event, which regularly draws upwards of 40 000 students to the city, is organized by a student group called the CSE Animations (Centre Sportif Etudiant) and runs annually from 1:00pm Wednesday to 1:00pm Thursday usually during the fourth week of October. Due to the recent terrorist attacks in Europe and the existing risk of new ones, the 2016 edition was cancelled.

The starting concept was simple, to race for 24 hours on a bike. Nowadays, competitors are separated in three categories: Racers, that race seriously; folk bikes, including decorated bikes and home built contraptions; and charity racers raising money for humanitarian causes.

The festival is an occasion for the numerous student associations in the town to compete in building silly bikes, set up some related activity, or simply provide beer and music to the tens of thousands of students coming from all over Belgium.

In the morning, the activities end with a concert by some famous singer in the main square.

This event gives a hint at how student life and traditions have developed on the newly born campus, reviving some long lost customs as the traditional Catholic Belgian students hat, the &quot;calotte&quot;.

The 24 hours have also been at the center of some more political issues. In 1999 it was cancelled due to the death of a drunken student who had fallen from the &quot;dalle&quot; in 1998. This happened again at the 2006 edition when a student was found dead in the early morning in the streets of &quot;the dalle&quot;. The event was also threatened in 2005 and 2006 because of a student associations strike and other organisation problems.

==Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park==
Created in 1971, Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park is the first of its kind in Belgium and is the biggest one in Wallonia (the French-speaking part of Belgium). It covers 2.31 square kilometres spread over the area of the town of Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve and the municipality of Mont-Saint-Guibert (30 km away from Brussels).

From the outset, the objectives pursued by the development of Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park were to develop cooperation between industry and the Université catholique de Louvain and to contribute to regional economic development. Particular emphasis is placed on environmental-friendliness, as well as the quality of the premises and their surroundings.

The main area of activity are:
* Life sciences
* Fine chemistry
* Information technologies
* Engineering

Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park is now home to more than 130 innovative companies and their 4500 employees, 1 business incubator and 3 business centres.

==The Hergé Museum==

The Hergé Museum is dedicated to the life and work of the Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi (1907–1983), who wrote under the pen name Hergé, creator of the series of comic albums, &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. It is located in the centre of Louvain-la-Neuve, on the edge of a green park, Le Parc de la Source. This location for the museum was originally chosen in 2001. The futuristic building was designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning French architect Christian de Portzamparc. On 22 May 2007 (the centenary of Hergé&#x27;s birth), the first stone of the museum was laid. Two years later, in June 2009, the museum opened its doors to the public.

The Hergé Museum contains eight permanent galleries displaying original artwork by Hergé, and telling the story of his life and career. Although his most famous creation, &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, features prominently, his other comic strip characters (such as &quot;Jo, Zette and Jocko&quot;, and &quot;Quick and Flupke&quot;) are also present. The exhibitions also include examples of Hergé&#x27;s diverse and prolific output working as a graphic designer in the 1930s. The museum houses a temporary exhibition gallery, which is updated every few months to host new exhibitions (with diverse titles such as &quot;Tintin, Hergé and Trains&quot; and &quot;Into Tibet with Tintin&quot;).

<doc id="307326" wikidata="Q170571" url="?curid=307326" title="Still life">
<text>A still life (: still lifes) is a work of art depicting mostly subject matter, typically commonplace objects which are either natural (food, flowers, dead animals, plants, rocks, shells, etc.) or human-made (drinking glasses, books, vases, jewelry, coins, pipes, etc.).

With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Greco-Roman art, still-life painting emerged as a distinct genre and professional specialization in Western painting by the late 16th century, and has remained significant since then. One advantage of the still-life artform is that it allows an artist much freedom to experiment with the arrangement of elements within a composition of a painting. Still life, as a particular genre, began with Netherlandish painting of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the English term &quot;still life&quot; derives from the Dutch word &quot;stilleven&quot;. Early still-life paintings, particularly before 1700, often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted. Later still-life works are produced with a variety of media and technology, such as found objects, photography, computer graphics, as well as video and sound.

The term includes the painting of dead animals, especially game. Live ones are considered animal art, although in practice they were often painted from dead models. Because of the use of plants and animals as a subject, the still-life category also shares commonalities with zoological and especially botanical illustration. However, with visual or fine art, the work is not intended merely to illustrate the subject correctly.

Still life occupied the lowest rung of the hierarchy of genres, but has been extremely popular with buyers. As well as the independent still-life subject, still-life painting encompasses other types of painting with prominent still-life elements, usually symbolic, and &quot;images that rely on a multitude of still-life elements ostensibly to reproduce a &#x27;slice of life. The &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; painting, which intends to deceive the viewer into thinking the scene is real, is a specialized type of still life, usually showing inanimate and relatively flat objects.

== Antecedents and development ==
Still-life paintings often adorn the interior of ancient Egyptian tombs. It was believed that food objects and other items depicted there would, in the afterlife, become real and available for use by the deceased. Ancient Greek vase paintings also demonstrate great skill in depicting everyday objects and animals. Peiraikos is mentioned by Pliny the Elder as a panel painter of &quot;low&quot; subjects, such as survive in mosaic versions and provincial wall-paintings at Pompeii: &quot;barbers&#x27; shops, cobblers&#x27; stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects&quot;.

Similar still life, more simply decorative in intent, but with realistic perspective, have also been found in the Roman wall paintings and floor mosaics unearthed at Pompeii, Herculaneum and the Villa Boscoreale, including the later familiar motif of a glass bowl of fruit. Decorative mosaics termed &quot;emblema&quot;, found in the homes of rich Romans, demonstrated the range of food enjoyed by the upper classes, and also functioned as signs of hospitality and as celebrations of the seasons and of life.

By the 16th century, food and flowers would again appear as symbols of the seasons and of the five senses. Also starting in Roman times is the tradition of the use of the skull in paintings as a symbol of mortality and earthly remains, often with the accompanying phrase &quot;Omnia mors aequat&quot; (Death makes all equal). These vanitas images have been re-interpreted through the last 400 years of art history, starting with Dutch painters around 1600.

The popular appreciation of the realism of still-life painting is related in the ancient Greek legend of Zeuxis and Parrhasius, who are said to have once competed to create the most lifelike objects, history&#x27;s earliest descriptions of &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; painting. As Pliny the Elder recorded in ancient Roman times, Greek artists centuries earlier were already advanced in the arts of portrait painting, genre painting and still life. He singled out Peiraikos, &quot;whose artistry is surpassed by only a very few...He painted barbershops and shoemakers&#x27; stalls, donkeys, vegetables, and such, and for that reason came to be called the &#x27;painter of vulgar subjects&#x27;; yet these works are altogether delightful, and they were sold at higher prices than the greatest [paintings] of many other artists.&quot;

=== Middle Ages and Early Renaissance ===

By 1300, starting with Giotto and his pupils, still-life painting was revived in the form of fictional niches on religious wall paintings which depicted everyday objects. Through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, still life in Western art remained primarily an adjunct to Christian religious subjects, and convened religious and allegorical meaning. This was particularly true in the work of Northern European artists, whose fascination with highly detailed optical realism and symbolism led them to lavish great attention on their paintings&#x27; overall message. Painters like Jan van Eyck often used still-life elements as part of an iconographic program.

In the late Middle Ages, still-life elements, mostly flowers but also animals and sometimes inanimate objects, were painted with increasing realism in the borders of illuminated manuscripts, developing models and technical advances that were used by painters of larger images. There was considerable overlap between the artists making miniatures for manuscripts and those painting panels, especially in Early Netherlandish painting. The Hours of Catherine of Cleves, probably made in Utrecht around 1440, is one of the outstanding examples of this trend, with borders featuring an extraordinary range of objects, including coins and fishing-nets, chosen to complement the text or main image at that particular point. Flemish workshops later in the century took the naturalism of border elements even further. Gothic millefleur tapestries are another example of the general increasing interest in accurate depictions of plants and animals. The set of &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot; is the best-known example, designed in Paris around 1500 and then woven in Flanders.

The development of oil painting technique by Jan van Eyck and other Northern European artists made it possible to paint everyday objects in this hyper-realistic fashion, owing to the slow drying, mixing, and layering qualities of oil colours. Among the first to break free of religious meaning were Leonardo da Vinci, who created watercolour studies of fruit (around 1495) as part of his restless examination of nature, and Albrecht Dürer who also made precise coloured drawings of flora and fauna.

Petrus Christus&#x27; portrait of a bride and groom visiting a goldsmith is a typical example of a transitional still life depicting both religious and secular content. Though mostly allegorical in message, the figures of the couple are realistic and the objects shown (coins, vessels, etc.) are accurately painted but the goldsmith is actually a depiction of St. Eligius and the objects heavily symbolic. Another similar type of painting is the family portrait combining figures with a well-set table of food, which symbolizes both the piety of the human subjects and their thanks for God&#x27;s abundance. Around this time, simple still-life depictions divorced of figures (but not allegorical meaning) were beginning to be painted on the outside of shutters of private devotional paintings. Another step toward the autonomous still life was the painting of symbolic flowers in vases on the back of secular portraits around 1475. Jacopo de&#x27; Barbari went a step further with his &quot;Still Life with Partridge and Gauntlets&quot; (1504), among the earliest signed and dated &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; still-life paintings, which contains minimal religious content.

== Later Renaissance ==
=== Sixteenth century ===
Though most still lifes after 1600 were relatively small paintings, a crucial stage in the development of the genre was the tradition, mostly centred on Antwerp, of the &quot;monumental still life&quot;, which were large paintings that included great spreads of still-life material with figures and often animals. This was a development by Pieter Aertsen, whose &quot;A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms&quot; (1551, now Uppsala) introduced the type with a painting that still startles. Another example is &quot;The Butcher Shop&quot; by Aertsen&#x27;s nephew Joachim Beuckelaer (1568), with its realistic depiction of raw meats dominating the foreground, while a background scene conveys the dangers of drunkenness and lechery. The type of very large kitchen or market scene developed by Pieter Aertsen and his nephew Joachim Beuckelaer typically depicts an abundance of food with a kitchenware still life and burly Flemish kitchen-maids. A small religious scene can often be made out in the distance, or a theme such as the Four Seasons is added to elevate the subject. This sort of large-scale still life continued to develop in Flemish painting after the separation of the North and South, but is rare in Dutch painting, although other works in this tradition anticipate the &quot;merry company&quot; type of genre painting.

Gradually, religious content diminished in size and placement in this type of painting, though moral lessons continued as sub-contexts. One of the relatively few Italian works in the style, Annibale Carracci&#x27;s treatment of the same subject in 1583, &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Shop&quot;, begins to remove the moral messages, as did other &quot;kitchen and market&quot; still-life paintings of this period. Vincenzo Campi probably introduced the Antwerp style to Italy in the 1570s. The tradition continued into the next century, with several works by Rubens, who mostly sub-contracted the still-life and animal elements to specialist masters such as Frans Snyders and his pupil Jan Fyt. By the second half of the 16th century, the autonomous still life evolved.
The 16th century witnessed an explosion of interest in the natural world and the creation of lavish botanical encyclopædias recording the discoveries of the New World and Asia. It also prompted the beginning of scientific illustration and the classification of specimens. Natural objects began to be appreciated as individual objects of study apart from any religious or mythological associations. The early science of herbal remedies began at this time as well, which was a practical extension of this new knowledge. In addition, wealthy patrons began to underwrite the collection of animal and mineral specimens, creating extensive cabinets of curiosities. These specimens served as models for painters who sought realism and novelty. Shells, insects, exotic fruits and flowers began to be collected and traded, and new plants such as the tulip (imported to Europe from Turkey), were celebrated in still-life paintings.

The horticultural explosion was of widespread interest in Europe and artist capitalized on that to produce thousands of still-life paintings. Some regions and courts had particular interests. The depiction of citrus, for example, was a particular passion of the Medici court in Florence, Italy. This great diffusion of natural specimens and the burgeoning interest in natural illustration throughout Europe, resulted in the nearly simultaneous creation of modern still-life paintings around 1600.

At the turn of the century the Spanish painter Juan Sánchez Cotán pioneered the Spanish still life with austerely tranquil paintings of vegetables, before entering a monastery in his forties in 1603, after which he painted religious subjects.

=== Sixteenth-century paintings ===
== Seventeenth century ==

Prominent Academicians of the early 17th century, such as Andrea Sacchi, felt that genre and still-life painting did not carry the &quot;gravitas&quot; merited for painting to be considered great. An influential formulation of 1667 by André Félibien, a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory of the hierarchy of genres for the 18th century:Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d&#x27;un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l&#x27;homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l&#x27;imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ...

He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seafood. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ...&quot;.

=== Dutch and Flemish painting ===

Still life developed as a separate category in the Low Countries in the last quarter of the 16th century. The English term &quot;still life&quot; derives from the Dutch word &quot;stilleven&quot; while Romance languages (as well as Greek, Polish, Russian and Turkish) tend to use terms meaning &quot;dead nature&quot;. 15th-century Early Netherlandish painting had developed highly illusionistic techniques in both panel painting and illuminated manuscripts, where the borders often featured elaborate displays of flowers, insects and, in a work like the Hours of Catherine of Cleves, a great variety of objects. When the illuminated manuscript was displaced by the printed book, the same skills were later deployed in scientific botanical illustration; the Low Countries led Europe in both botany and its depiction in art. The Flemish artist Joris Hoefnagel (1542–1601) made watercolour and gouache paintings of flowers and other still-life subjects for the Emperor Rudolf II, and there were many engraved illustrations for books (often then hand-coloured), such as Hans Collaert&#x27;s &quot;Florilegium&quot;, published by Plantin in 1600.

Around 1600 flower paintings in oils became something of a craze; Karel van Mander painted some works himself, and records that other Northern Mannerist artists such as Cornelis van Haarlem also did so. No surviving flower-pieces by them are known, but many survive by the leading specialists, Jan Brueghel the Elder and Ambrosius Bosschaert, both active in the Southern Netherlands.

While artists in the North found limited opportunity to produce the religious iconography which had long been their staple—images of religious subjects were forbidden in the Dutch Reformed Protestant Church—the continuing Northern tradition of detailed realism and hidden symbols appealed to the growing Dutch middle classes, who were replacing Church and State as the principal patrons of art in the Netherlands. Added to this was the Dutch mania for horticulture, particularly the tulip. These two views of flowers—as aesthetic objects and as religious symbols— merged to create a very strong market for this type of still life. Still life, like most Dutch art work, was generally sold in open markets or by dealers, or by artists at their studios, and rarely commissioned; therefore, artists usually chose the subject matter and arrangement. So popular was this type of still-life painting, that much of the technique of Dutch flower painting was codified in the 1740 treatise &quot;Groot Schilderboeck&quot; by Gerard de Lairesse, which gave wide-ranging advice on colour, arranging, brushwork, preparation of specimens, harmony, composition, perspective, etc.

The symbolism of flowers had evolved since early Christian days. The most common flowers and their symbolic meanings include: rose (Virgin Mary, transience, Venus, love); lily (Virgin Mary, virginity, female breast, purity of mind or justice); tulip (showiness, nobility); sunflower (faithfulness, divine love, devotion); violet (modesty, reserve, humility); columbine (melancholy); poppy (power, sleep, death). As for insects, the butterfly represents transformation and resurrection while the dragonfly symbolizes transience and the ant hard work and attention to the harvest.

Flemish and Dutch artists also branched out and revived the ancient Greek still life tradition of &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, particularly the imitation of nature or &quot;mimesis&quot;, which they termed &quot;bedriegertje&quot; (&quot;little deception&quot;). In addition to these types of still life, Dutch artists identified and separately developed &quot;kitchen and market&quot; paintings, breakfast and food table still life, vanitas paintings, and allegorical collection paintings.

In the Catholic Southern Netherlands the genre of garland paintings was developed. Around 1607–1608, Antwerp artists Jan Brueghel the Elder and Hendrick van Balen started creating these pictures which consist of an image (usually devotional) which is encircled by a lush still life wreath. The paintings were collaborations between two specialists: a still life and a figure painter. Daniel Seghers developed the genre further. Originally serving a devotional function, garland paintings became extremely popular and were widely used as decoration of homes.

A special genre of still life was the so-called pronkstilleven (Dutch for &#x27;ostentatious still life&#x27;). This style of ornate still-life painting was developed in the 1640s in Antwerp by Flemish artists such as Frans Snyders and Adriaen van Utrecht. They painted still lifes that emphasized abundance by depicting a diversity of objects, fruits, flowers and dead game, often together with living people and animals. The style was soon adopted by artists from the Dutch Republic.

Especially popular in this period were vanitas paintings, in which sumptuous arrangements of fruit and flowers, books, statuettes, vases, coins, jewelry, paintings, musical and scientific instruments, military insignia, fine silver and crystal, were accompanied by symbolic reminders of life&#x27;s impermanence. Additionally, a skull, an hourglass or pocket watch, a candle burning down or a book with pages turning, would serve as a moralizing message on the ephemerality of sensory pleasures. Often some of the fruits and flowers themselves would be shown starting to spoil or fade to emphasize the same point.

Another type of still life, known as &quot;ontbijtjes&quot; or &quot;breakfast paintings&quot;, represent both a literal presentation of delicacies that the upper class might enjoy and a religious reminder to avoid gluttony. Around 1650 Samuel van Hoogstraten painted one of the first wall-rack pictures, &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; still-life paintings which feature objects tied, tacked or attached in some other fashion to a wall board, a type of still life very popular in the United States in the 19th century. Another variation was the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; still life depicted objects associated with a given profession, as with the Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrecht&#x27;s painting &quot;Painter&#x27;s Easel with Fruit Piece&quot;, which displays all the tools of a painter&#x27;s craft. Also popular in the first half of the 17th century was the painting of a large assortment of specimens in allegorical form, such as the &quot;five senses&quot;, &quot;four continents&quot;, or &quot;the four seasons&quot;, showing a goddess or allegorical figure surrounded by appropriate natural and human-made objects. The popularity of vanitas paintings, and these other forms of still life, soon spread from Holland to Flanders and Germany, and also to Spain and France.

The Netherlandish production of still lifes was enormous, and they were very widely exported, especially to northern Europe; Britain hardly produced any itself. German still life followed closely the Dutch models; Georg Flegel was a pioneer in pure still life without figures and created the compositional innovation of placing detailed objects in cabinets, cupboards, and display cases, and producing simultaneous multiple views.

In Spanish art, a bodegón is a still-life painting depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often arranged on a simple stone slab, and also a painting with one or more figures, but significant still-life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern. Starting in the Baroque period, such paintings became popular in Spain in the second quarter of the 17th century. The tradition of still-life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary Low Countries, today Belgium and Netherlands (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in southern Europe. Northern still lifes had many subgenres; the &quot;breakfast piece&quot; was augmented by the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, the &quot;flower bouquet&quot;, and the &quot;vanitas&quot;.

In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of &quot;breakfast piece&quot; did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table. Still-life painting in Spain, also called bodegones, was austere. It differed from Dutch still life, which often contained rich banquets surrounded by ornate and luxurious items of fabric or glass. The game in Spanish paintings is often plain dead animals still waiting to be skinned. The fruits and vegetables are uncooked. The backgrounds are bleak or plain wood geometric blocks, often creating a surrealist air. Even while both Dutch and Spanish still life often had an embedded moral purpose, the austerity, which some find akin to the bleakness of some of the Spanish plateaus, appears to reject the sensual pleasures, plenitude, and luxury of Dutch still-life paintings.

Even though Italian still-life painting (in Italian referred to as &quot;natura morta&quot;, &quot;dead nature&quot;) was gaining in popularity, it remained historically less respected than the &quot;grand manner&quot; painting of historical, religious, and mythic subjects. On the other hand, successful Italian still-life artists found ample patronage in their day. Furthermore, women painters, few as they were, commonly chose or were restricted to painting still life; Giovanna Garzoni, Laura Bernasconi, Maria Theresa van Thielen, and Fede Galizia are notable examples.

Many leading Italian artists in other genre, also produced some still-life paintings. In particular, Caravaggio applied his influential form of naturalism to still life. His &quot;Basket of Fruit&quot; (–1600) is one of the first examples of pure still life, precisely rendered and set at eye level. Though not overtly symbolic, this painting was owned by Cardinal Federico Borromeo and may have been appreciated for both religious and aesthetic reasons. Jan Bruegel painted his &quot;Large Milan Bouquet&quot; (1606) for the cardinal, as well, claiming that he painted it &#x27;fatta tutti del natturel&#x27; (made all from nature) and he charged extra for the extra effort. These were among many still-life paintings in the cardinal&#x27;s collection, in addition to his large collection of curios. Among other Italian still life, Bernardo Strozzi&#x27;s &quot;The Cook&quot; is a &quot;kitchen scene&quot; in the Dutch manner, which is both a detailed portrait of a cook and the game birds she is preparing. In a similar manner, one of Rembrandt&#x27;s rare still-life paintings, &quot;Little Girl with Dead Peacocks&quot; combines a similar sympathetic female portrait with images of game birds.

In Catholic Italy and Spain, the pure vanitas painting was rare, and there were far fewer still-life specialists. In Southern Europe there is more employment of the soft naturalism of Caravaggio and less emphasis on hyper-realism in comparison with Northern European styles. In France, painters of still lifes (&quot;nature morte&quot;) were influenced by both the Northern and Southern schools, borrowing from the vanitas paintings of the Netherlands and the spare arrangements of Spain.

== Eighteenth century ==

The 18th century to a large extent continued to refine 17th-century formulae, and levels of production decreased. In the Rococo style floral decoration became far more common on porcelain, wallpaper, fabrics and carved wood furnishings, so that buyers preferred their paintings to have figures for a contrast. One change was a new enthusiasm among French painters, who now form a large proportion of the most notable artists, while the English remained content to import. Jean-Baptiste Chardin painted small and simple assemblies of food and objects in a most subtle style that both built on the Dutch Golden Age masters, and was to be very influential on 19th-century compositions. Dead game subjects continued to be popular, especially for hunting lodges; most specialists also painted live animal subjects. Jean-Baptiste Oudry combined superb renderings of the textures of fur and feather with simple backgrounds, often the plain white of a lime-washed larder wall, that showed them off to advantage.

By the 18th century, in many cases, the religious and allegorical connotations of still-life paintings were dropped and kitchen table paintings evolved into calculated depictions of varied colour and form, displaying everyday foods. The French aristocracy employed artists to execute paintings of bounteous and extravagant still-life subjects that graced their dining table, also without the moralistic vanitas message of their Dutch predecessors. The Rococo love of artifice led to a rise in appreciation in France for &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; (French: &quot;trick the eye&quot;) painting. Jean-Baptiste Chardin&#x27;s still-life paintings employ a variety of techniques from Dutch-style realism to softer harmonies.

The bulk of Anne Vallayer-Coster&#x27;s work was devoted to the language of still life as it had been developed in the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. During these centuries, the genre of still life was placed lowest on the hierarchical ladder. Vallayer-Coster had a way about her paintings that resulted in their attractiveness. It was the &quot;bold, decorative lines of her compositions, the richness of her colours and simulated textures, and the feats of illusionism she achieved in depicting wide variety of objects, both natural and artificial&quot; which drew in the attention of the Royal Académie and the numerous collectors who purchased her paintings. This interaction between art and nature was quite common in Dutch, Flemish and French still lifes. Her work reveals the clear influence of Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, as well as 17th-century Dutch masters, whose work has been far more highly valued, but what made Vallayer-Coster&#x27;s style stand out against the other still-life painters was her unique way of coalescing representational illusionism with decorative compositional structures.

The end of the eighteenth century and the fall of the French monarchy closed the doors on Vallayer-Coster&#x27;s still-life &#x27;era&#x27; and opened them to her new style of florals. It has been argued that this was the highlight of her career and what she is best known for. However, it has also been argued that the flower paintings were futile to her career. Nevertheless, this collection contained floral studies in oil, watercolour and gouache.

== Nineteenth century ==
With the rise of the European Academies, most notably the Académie française which held a central role in Academic art, still life began to fall from favor. The Academies taught the doctrine of the &quot;Hierarchy of genres&quot; (or &quot;Hierarchy of Subject Matter&quot;), which held that a painting&#x27;s artistic merit was based primarily on its subject. In the Academic system, the highest form of painting consisted of images of historical, Biblical or mythological significance, with still-life subjects relegated to the very lowest order of artistic recognition. Instead of using still life to glorify nature, some artists, such as John Constable and Camille Corot, chose landscapes to serve that end.

When Neoclassicism started to go into decline by the 1830s, genre and portrait painting became the focus for the Realist and Romantic artistic revolutions. Many of the great artists of that period included still life in their body of work. The still-life paintings of Francisco Goya, Gustave Courbet, and Eugène Delacroix convey a strong emotional current, and are less concerned with exactitude and more interested in mood. Though patterned on the earlier still-life subjects of Chardin, Édouard Manet&#x27;s still-life paintings are strongly tonal and clearly headed toward Impressionism. Henri Fantin-Latour, using a more traditional technique, was famous for his exquisite flower paintings and made his living almost exclusively painting still life for collectors.

However, it was not until the final decline of the Academic hierarchy in Europe, and the rise of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters, that technique and colour harmony triumphed over subject matter, and that still life was once again avidly practiced by artists. In his early still life, Claude Monet shows the influence of Fantin-Latour, but is one of the first to break the tradition of the dark background, which Pierre-Auguste Renoir also discards in &quot;Still Life with Bouquet and Fan&quot; (1871), with its bright orange background. With Impressionist still life, allegorical and mythological content is completely absent, as is meticulously detailed brushwork. Impressionists instead focused on experimentation in broad, dabbing brush strokes, tonal values, and colour placement. The Impressionists and Post-Impressionists were inspired by nature&#x27;s colour schemes but reinterpreted nature with their own colour harmonies, which sometimes proved startlingly unnaturalistic. As Gauguin stated, &quot;Colours have their own meanings.&quot; Variations in perspective are also tried, such as using tight cropping and high angles, as with &quot;Fruit Displayed on a Stand&quot; by Gustave Caillebotte, a painting which was mocked at the time as a &quot;display of fruit in a bird&#x27;s-eye view.&quot;

Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Sunflowers&quot; paintings are some of the best-known 19th-century still-life paintings. Van Gogh uses mostly tones of yellow and rather flat rendering to make a memorable contribution to still-life history. His &quot;Still Life with Drawing Board&quot; (1889) is a self-portrait in still-life form, with Van Gogh depicting many items of his personal life, including his pipe, simple food (onions), an inspirational book, and a letter from his brother, all laid out on his table, without his own image present. He also painted his own version of a vanitas painting &quot;Still Life with Open Bible, Candle, and Book&quot; (1885).

In the United States during Revolutionary times, American artists trained abroad applied European styles to American portrait painting and still life. Charles Willson Peale founded a family of prominent American painters, and as major leader in the American art community, also founded a society for the training of artists and a famous museum of natural curiosities. His son Raphaelle Peale was one of a group of early American still-life artists, which also included John F. Francis, Charles Bird King, and John Johnston. By the second half of the 19th century, Martin Johnson Heade introduced the American version of the habitat or biotope picture, which placed flowers and birds in simulated outdoor environments. The American &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; paintings also flourished during this period, created by John Haberle, William Michael Harnett, and John Frederick Peto. Peto specialized in the nostalgic wall-rack painting while Harnett achieved the highest level of hyper-realism in his pictorial celebrations of American life through familiar objects.

=== Nineteenth-century paintings ===
== Twentieth century ==
The first four decades of the 20th century formed an exceptional artistic ferment and revolution period. Avant-garde movements rapidly evolved and overlapped in a march towards nonfigurative, total abstraction. The still life and other representational art continued to evolve and adjust until mid-century when total abstraction, as exemplified by Jackson Pollock&#x27;s drip paintings, eliminated all recognizable content.

The century began with several trends taking hold in art. In 1901, Paul Gauguin painted &quot;Still Life with Sunflowers&quot;, his homage to his friend Van Gogh who had died eleven years earlier. The group known as Les Nabis, including Pierre Bonnard and Édouard Vuillard, took up Gauguin&#x27;s harmonic theories and added elements inspired by Japanese woodcuts to their still-life paintings. French artist Odilon Redon also painted notable still life during this period, especially flowers.

Henri Matisse reduced the rendering of still-life objects even further to little more than bold, flat outlines filled with bright colours. He also simplified perspective and introduced multi-colour backgrounds. In some of his still-life paintings, such as &quot;Still Life with Eggplants&quot;, his table of objects is nearly lost amidst the other colourful patterns filling the rest of the room. Other exponents of Fauvism, such as Maurice de Vlaminck and André Derain, further explored pure colour and abstraction in their still life.

Paul Cézanne found in still life the perfect vehicle for his revolutionary explorations in geometric spatial organization. For Cézanne, still life was a primary means of taking painting away from an illustrative or mimetic function to one demonstrating independently the elements of colour, form, and line, a major step towards Abstract art. Additionally, Cézanne&#x27;s experiments can be seen as leading directly to the development of Cubist still life in the early 20th century.

Adapting Cézanne&#x27;s shifting of planes and axes, the Cubists subdued the colour palette of the Fauves and focused instead on deconstructing objects into pure geometrical forms and planes. Between 1910 and 1920, Cubist artists like Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Juan Gris painted many still-life compositions, often including musical instruments, bringing still life to the forefront of artistic innovation, almost for the first time. Still life was also the subject matter in the first Synthetic Cubist collage works, such as Picasso&#x27;s oval &quot;Still Life with Chair Caning&quot; (1912). In these works, still-life objects overlap and intermingle, barely maintaining identifiable two-dimensional forms, losing individual surface texture, and merging into the background—achieving goals nearly opposite to those of traditional still life. Fernand Léger&#x27;s still life introduced the use of abundant white space and coloured, sharply defined, overlapping geometrical shapes to produce a more mechanical effect.

Rejecting the flattening of space by Cubists, Marcel Duchamp and other members of the Dada movement, went in a radically different direction, creating 3-D &quot;ready-made&quot; still-life sculptures. As part of restoring some symbolic meaning to still life, the Futurists and the Surrealists placed recognizable still-life objects in their dreamscapes. In Joan Miró&#x27;s still-life paintings, objects appear weightless and float in lightly suggested two-dimensional space, and even mountains are drawn as simple lines. In Italy during this time, Giorgio Morandi was the foremost still-life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements. Dutch artist M. C. Escher, best known for his detailed yet ambiguous graphics, created &quot;Still life and Street&quot; (1937), his updated version of the traditional Dutch table still life. In England Eliot Hodgkin was using tempera for his highly detailed still-life paintings.

When 20th-century American artists became aware of European Modernism, they began to interpret still-life subjects with a combination of American realism and Cubist-derived abstraction. Typical of the American still-life works of this period are the paintings of Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Stuart Davis, and Marsden Hartley, and the photographs of Edward Weston. O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s ultra-closeup flower paintings reveal both the physical structure and the emotional subtext of petals and leaves in an unprecedented manner.

In Mexico, starting in the 1930s, Frida Kahlo and other artists created their own brand of Surrealism, featuring native foods and cultural motifs in their still-life paintings.

Starting in the 1930s, abstract expressionism severely reduced still life to raw depictions of form and colour, until by the 1950s, total abstraction dominated the art world. However, pop art in the 1960s and 1970s reversed the trend and created a new form of still life. Much pop art (such as Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Soup Cans&quot;) is based on still life, but its true subject is most often the commodified image of the commercial product represented rather than the physical still-life object itself. Roy Lichtenstein&#x27;s &quot;Still Life with Goldfish Bowl&quot; (1972) combines the pure colours of Matisse with the pop iconography of Warhol. Wayne Thiebaud&#x27;s &quot;Lunch Table&quot; (1964) portrays not a single family&#x27;s lunch but an assembly line of standardized American foods.

The Neo-dada movement, including Jasper Johns, returned to Duchamp&#x27;s three-dimensional representation of everyday household objects to create their own brand of still-life work, as in Johns&#x27; &quot;Painted Bronze&quot; (1960) and &quot;Fool&#x27;s House&quot; (1962). Avigdor Arikha, who began as an abstractionist, integrated the lessons of Piet Mondrian into his still lifes as into his other work; while reconnecting to old master traditions, he achieved a modernist formalism, working in one session and in natural light, through which the subject-matter often emerged in a surprising perspective.

A significant contribution to the development of still-life painting in the 20th century was made by Russian artists, among them Sergei Ocipov, Victor Teterin, Evgenia Antipova, Gevork Kotiantz, Sergei Zakharov, Taisia Afonina, Maya Kopitseva, and others.

By contrast, the rise of Photorealism in the 1970s reasserted illusionistic representation, while retaining some of Pop&#x27;s message of the fusion of object, image, and commercial product. Typical in this regard are the paintings of Don Eddy and Ralph Goings.

=== Twentieth-century paintings ===
=== 21st century ===

During the 20th and 21st centuries, the notion of the still life has been extended beyond the traditional two dimensional art forms of painting into video art and three dimensional art forms such as sculpture, performance and installation. Some mixed media still-life works employ found objects, photography, video, and sound, and even spill out from ceiling to floor and fill an entire room in a gallery. Through video, still-life artists have incorporated the viewer into their work. Following from the computer age with computer art and digital art, the notion of the still life has also included digital technology. Computer-generated graphics have potentially increased the techniques available to still-life artists. 3D computer graphics and 2D computer graphics with 3D photorealistic effects are used to generate synthetic still life images. For example, graphic art software includes filters that can be applied to 2D vector graphics or 2D raster graphics on transparent layers. Visual artists have copied or visualised 3D effects to manually render photorealistic effects without the use of filters.

<text>Legazpi is a city in the Gipuzkoa province of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, northern Spain.

Legazpi is a town of about 9,000 inhabitants located on top of the Urola valley, in Gipuzkoa. Surrounded by mountains, and at the foot of the Aizkorri mountain range, its predominant economic activity is industrial (manufacturing, metal processing, plastics).

The rich industrial tradition of Legazpi goes back to the High Middle Ages, when transformation of iron ore was achieved by means of the &quot;haizeolak&quot; (&quot;ironworks moved by wind&quot;). During the 14th century, wind energy came to be replaced by water in the metal processing with the foundation of several &quot;ironworks propelled by water&quot; (&quot;ur&quot; &#x27;water&#x27; and &quot;ola&quot; originally &#x27;shack&#x27;, are the two lexical components of &quot;Urola&quot;, a river crossing Legazpi). This industrial tradition had its continuity in modern times, and Legazpi became one of the most important metallurgic centres in the industrialised modern Basque Country.
One of the 14th century ironworks (called &quot;Mirandaola&quot;) has remained in place to date like nowhere else in the Basque Country. It is the heart of a thematic park with an educational and touristy vocation, where traditions and ways of living from the past are shown.

<text>Banjo-Kazooie is a 1998 platform game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. Controlling the player characters, the bear Banjo and the bird Kazooie, the player attempts to save Banjo&#x27;s kidnapped sister Tooty from the witch Gruntilda. The player explores nine nonlinear worlds to gather items and progress. Using Banjo and Kazooie&#x27;s traversal and combat abilities, they complete challenges such as solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, and defeating bosses.

Rare conceived &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; as a role-playing video game, &quot;Dream&quot;, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System following the completion of &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; (1995). The 15-member team, led by Gregg Mayles, transitioned development to the Nintendo 64 and retooled the game as a platformer after the role-playing format proved too complex. &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was inspired by &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996) and designed to appeal to a broad audience, similar to Disney films. Grant Kirkhope composed the soundtrack; &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was one of the first games to feature vertical remixing, where various sound layers fade in and out depending on the player&#x27;s location.

Released in North America in late June 1998 and in Europe the following month, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; sold over three million copies, making it one of the bestselling Nintendo 64 games. It received acclaim from critics, who said it surpassed &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; as the best 3D platform and adventure game. The game was praised for its visuals, soundtrack, characters, writing, humour, and level design, while criticism was directed towards lack of originality and the camera system. &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; received numerous year-end accolades, including two from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences: &quot;Console Action Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics&quot;.

In retrospect, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; is considered one of Rare&#x27;s best games and among the best Nintendo 64 games. It spawned a series which includes two sequels, &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; (2000) and &quot;Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts&quot; (2008), and two spin-offs, &quot;Grunty&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (2003) and &quot;Banjo-Pilot&quot; (2005). Following Microsoft&#x27;s 2002 acquisition of Rare, 4J Studios developed a port for the Xbox 360 in 2008, later included in the Xbox One compilation &quot;Rare Replay&quot; in 2015. It was released on the Nintendo Switch for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers in 2022, marking its first rerelease on a Nintendo console.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; is a single-player platform game where the player controls the titular protagonists, an easy-going brown honey bear named Banjo and a troublemaking female red-crested &quot;Breegull&quot; Kazooie, from a third-person perspective. The game features nine three-dimensional worlds where the player must gather musical notes and jigsaw puzzle pieces, called Jiggies, to progress.

The player travels from one world to another through Gruntilda&#x27;s Lair, a region that acts as the game&#x27;s central overworld. Jiggies allow the player to complete jigsaw puzzles which open doors to new worlds, while musical notes are required to open doors to new sections of the overworld. There are a total of 100 jiggies to collect (ten in each world), all of which are needed to view the proper ending, and 900 notes (100 in each world). The door with the highest amount of required notes has 880, although 765 are needed to enter the final section. Like &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996), &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; is very open and allows the player to collect Jiggies and musical notes in a nonlinear order. It is also possible to complete certain worlds out of order, assuming the player has enough Jiggies and musical notes to reach a world earlier than intended.

Each world is composed of a number of challenges that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, racing, playing a bonus game, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. Tasks include spelling words, helping lights get on a Christmas tree while protecting them from getting eaten, and looking for a pirate&#x27;s gold. The game features action-adventure elements, and the player must often interact with non-player characters and help them. It is also possible to increase Banjo and Kazooie&#x27;s health bar by collecting empty honeycomb pieces (of which there are two in each world), and extra lives by obtaining Banjo statues.

Banjo and Kazooie can perform many abilities, such as jumping, climbing, ground-pounding, swimming, flying, and rolling into enemies. The game has a total of 14 special moves, and some cannot be performed until conversing with Bottles the mole, who teaches them. The breegull and the bear have unique assets. For example, while swimming, Kazooie moves faster but also has a harder time turning directions than Banjo, who only swims when above ground. Kazooie can perform the Talon Trot, where she runs faster and up slopes too steep for Banjo, the Beak Bomb, a long and fast hit towards something with her beak that she pulls off while flying, and either shoot blue eggs from the front or rear. In the middle of jumps or falls from great heights, Kazooie can use her wings to glide Banjo down at a slower speed for a few seconds. She can also fly and jump way higher than Banjo, but these moves can only be activated by standing on pads signifying them; pads with red feathers on them activate flying, green Shock Spring pads the extra jump height. Some abilities require specific items to be performed. For instance, red feathers allow Banjo and Kazooie to fly, while gold feathers protect them from damage. There are two types of collectible shoes that provide temporary abilities. The Turbo Trainer shoes provide a speed burst used to reach a destination on time, while Wellington boots allows Kazooie to run on otherwise harmful ground, such as the piranha-filled waters in Bubblegloop Swamp and shifting sands in Gobi&#x27;s Valley.

Additionally, found in each world are five small creatures called Jinjos that Gruntilda imprisoned and, upon collection of the entire world&#x27;s population, grant the duo a Jiggy. For the camera, there are three choices of views and the ability to spin the camera around the player character. However, some areas fix the camera to one angle, which sometimes hides items out of view, requiring the player to choose a first-person perspective to see them.

Banjo and Kazooie are also aided by Gruntilda&#x27;s sister, Brentilda, who provides information about the witch needed to defeat her, and Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman who used to be Gruntilda&#x27;s teacher. Mumbo Jumbo can use magical powers to transform them into several creatures. These include a termite, an alligator, a walrus, a pumpkin, and a honeybee. Creatures have their own abilities and allow the player to access otherwise inaccessible challenges, some of which are required to collect jiggies. Before a transformation process is allowed, the player must find a required number of &quot;Mumbo Tokens&quot; in the worlds. By finding a spell book called Cheato in the game&#x27;s overworld, the player may also unlock secret codes that increase the capacity of Banjo and Kazooie&#x27;s item inventory, such as the red feathers from 50 to 100 and the blue eggs from 100 to 200.

== Plot ==
Banjo the bear lives on Spiral Mountain with his bird friend, Kazooie and younger sister, Tooty. One day, an evil witch named Gruntilda, who also lives on Spiral Mountain, asks her sentient cauldron, Dingpot, who the prettiest girl on the mountain is, to which Dingpot reveals that it is Tooty who is the prettiest, to Gruntilda&#x27;s frustration and jealousy. Wishing to be prettier than Tooty, Gruntilda decides to steal her beauty. As Tooty begins talking with Bottles the mole, Gruntilda suddenly arrives and kidnaps Tooty, taking the young girl to her lair on the top of Spiral Mountain; Banjo and Kazooie hear the commotion and upon being informed by Bottles of the situation, they venture to Gruntilda&#x27;s Lair to confront her.

As Banjo and Kazooie enter Gruntilda&#x27;s Lair, it is revealed that Gruntilda and her minion, Klungo, have built a machine used to transfer Tooty&#x27;s beauty to Gruntilda&#x27;s body. Banjo and Kazooie soon discover how to use Jiggies to warp to other lands, where they rescue creatures called Jinjos, whom Gruntilda captured. As the two progress further through Gruntilda&#x27;s lair, they eventually find Gruntilda, who hosts a quiz game show called &quot;Grunty&#x27;s Furnace Fun&quot;, which offers Tooty as a prize for winning the game but threatens to kill Banjo and Kazooie in lava if they fail. Banjo and Kazooie manage to beat the game thanks to information given prior by Brentilda, Gruntilda&#x27;s friendly sister, and they rescue Tooty, while Gruntilda flees to the roof of her lair. Afterwards, Banjo and Kazooie return home and celebrate their success with a barbecue until Tooty, knowing that Gruntilda is still at large, urges the two to return to Gruntilda&#x27;s Lair and properly defeat her.

Upon arriving back in Gruntilda&#x27;s lair, Banjo and Kazooie meet Dingpot, who resents Gruntilda for all of her abuse toward him and decides to help the two reach the top of the witch&#x27;s lair. On the roof, Banjo and Kazooie battle Gruntilda and, with help from all the rescued Jinjos, they knock the witch off her tower, causing her to land on the ground and creating a crater in the shape of her body, which is promptly covered by a boulder, trapping the still-alive Gruntilda. With Gruntilda finally defeated, Banjo, Kazooie, Tooty, and Bottles all relax on a beach. In a post-credits scene, Banjo and Kazooie&#x27;s shaman friend, Mumbo Jumbo, gives information on an upcoming sequel, while Gruntilda and Klungo vow revenge.

==Development==
===Origins===

The origins of &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; can be traced back to &quot;Project Dream&quot;, a cancelled video game developed by Rare&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; (1995) team for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Inspired by Japanese role-playing games and LucasArts adventure games, &quot;Dream&quot; was developed for 16 months and starred a boy who got into trouble with a group of pirates. The game used Rare&#x27;s Advanced Computer Modelling (ACM) graphics technology, first used in &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1994), to an advanced level.&quot; It involved the layering of several sprites to provide depth, achieved with &quot;hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of rendering equipment. As development progressed, the boy was considered by the developers to be generic; thus he was replaced by a rabbit for &quot;two or three days,&quot; then a bear who wore a backpack, trainers and cap. The bear eventually became Banjo.

Because the introduction of the Nintendo 64 made the ACM technology obsolete, Rare decided to transition the development of the game to that console. When this occurred, the Nintendo 64 was still known as the Ultra 64. The console was also not powerful enough to generate the amount of sprites the ACM technology required, so the graphics were now run by a &quot;pseudo-3D&quot; engine. The project proved to be too ambitious for the developers, who felt the game was not fun. More than a year into the project, out of desperation &quot;like the end wasn&#x27;t in sight,&quot; the project switched from &quot;Dream&quot; to a &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;-esque 2.5D side-scrolling platformer, with more depth and range of movement than a typical 2D platformer. It was given the names &quot;2.5-D Banjo&quot; and &quot;Kazoo&quot;.

In the 2.5D game, Banjo would have collected fruits, the equivalent to musical notes in &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, in five &quot;fruit houses&quot; named after the fruit in them: oranges, grapes, lemons, bananas and cherries. Collecting jigsaw pieces would have also been done. Similarly to the barrels in &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, Banjo would have used balls from a variety of sports, such as a football, baseball, American football, bowling ball, basketball, and a water-filled ballon, that could be powered up by a balloon inflator, football boot, football helmet and baseball glove. The enemy parts and hub map were also taken from the 1994 SNES platformer.

Although the game was 3D, the sprites were flat and rendered from a perspective above them. Rare found executing this convincingly too complicated, such as when the camera angle shifted, which would result in sprites interweaving. Two months into its 2.5D phase, Rare was presented by Nintendo with a &quot;really, really early&quot; version of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; (1996), which exposed them to the perceived future direction it would take the video games market. The genre was changed accordingly, a new 3D engine was built, and the aesthetic became focused on cuteness, requiring an alteration in Banjo&#x27;s proportions (such as an increased head shape) and less tight shorts to match it. As Chris Sutherland described the philosophy of the shift in plans, &quot;Although we had a lot less polygons, we could still imbue some character into the characters and the world, even though that left us with a much smaller polygon count.&quot; However, much of the controls were the same.

=== Staff and workflow ===
The team comprised both experienced and inexperienced people; some had been working at Rare for 10 years while others had never previously worked on a video game. Gregg Mayles served as the head designer, Mayles&#x27; brother Steve &quot;chief scribbler&quot; and character designer, and Chris Sutherland, head programmer. Ed Bryan was also a character artist, specifically Mumbo Jumbo and the Jinjos, as well as animator and box cover artist. Bryan has not revealed much about the making of the cover art, other than that Rare wanted him to &quot;tell a story&quot; with it. Kieran Connell was junior software engineer when the team said &quot;the game had no chance of being completed on time,&quot; and Gavin Price joined as tester only a few months after receiving a demo of the game from &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;.

Actual work on &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; started in March 1997 with a development team of 10 people. As development progressed, the team grew to a total of 15 members, which included seven engineers, five artists, two designers and one musician. The development of the game took 17 months to complete after Rare discarded &quot;Project Dream&quot;, the first two of these being spent experimenting with &quot;Dream&quot;″s graphic technology. Each staff member had a work week of at least 80 hours, each day lasting until three to five in the morning. Mayles and Bryan, in one week, attempted forty hours of normal time and 60 overtime hours for a total of 100 hours. Mayles admitted in 2022 to having worked 102 hours in a single week. Sutherland reported one morning where the Stamper brothers threw stones at his house window, as well as provided a McDonald&#x27;s meal, to get him to work. As part of Rare&#x27;s late 1990s strategy of rewarding staff with bonus royalties, the &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; staff was paid 50 cents per sold game in addition to their average salaries, higher than the 17-cent-per-cartridge amount of &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; (1997) but lower than the full-dollar-per-cartridge total of &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; (1999).

=== Design ===
Despite being praised by critics and gamers as an improved version of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was not intended by the team to simply be that. However, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;″s 3D aspect was referenced heavily, as it was the only game similar to &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; that had been released, and Rare intended to combine it with the look of &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;. The developers appreciated the freedom of movement &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; provided, but considered it did not take enough advantage of it; instead, it centred on the quick timing and reflexes required for most 2D platformers, which Mayles considered unsuitable for 3D games due to the reduced accuracy in viewing distances. A major reason for this was the camera of a 3D game. Sutherland described &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;″s camera as the camera and the player character being attached to each other with a string, with the only movement being tilting when he moves around the front of the camera. He acknowledged the camera was probably coded that way so as to avoid the player being adrift, but felt it occasionally got behind Mario and would do so even more in &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;″s significantly more complex geometry. For jumping sections, he also found it &quot;fiddly&quot; to have to press buttons just to orientate the camera to see another platform. Thus &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;″s gameplay was mostly exploration and discovery instead of platforming. Rare also disliked &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;″s forcing of the player back into the hub world once they collect a star in the level, thinking that it hindered immersion.

For the collectibles, Mayles wanted &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; to differ from other games involving collecting, in that &quot;rather than being just a shiny object, [the jiggy] was a shiny object that could actually be used for something.&quot; The jinjos, which Mayles deemed the game&#x27;s most ill-considered collectable, were green-lit out of an idea Rare had since developing &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1994), a &quot;hard-to-collect collectable&quot; that chased away or camouflaged when the player was about to obtain it. However, they stood and whistled to the player character in the final product. Other collectables, such as the eggs, feathers, notes and honeycombs, were incorporated to contribute to the theme of the titular protagonists. Difficulty balance was a major focus; for example, the musical notes were ultimately the only collectibles the player would lose if they died or exited a level.

Rare decided to make an action-based game that focused totally on Banjo and his abilities, Kazooie later born out of the planning of them. Mayles wanted Banjo to run really fast and have a double jump, but thought the bear looked strange doing it. According to Mayles, &quot;We came up with the [...] idea that a pair of wings could appear from his backpack to help him perform a second jump. We also wanted Banjo to be able to run very fast when required [so] we added a pair of &#x27;fast-running&#x27; legs that appeared from the bottom of the backpack. [And soon after] we came up with the logical conclusion that these could belong to another character, one that actually lived in Banjo&#x27;s backpack.&quot; Furthermore, the backpack containing an animal also made sense of Banjo&#x27;s relatively slow walk. Kazooie was named after a kazoo, which was considered an annoying instrument, &quot;much like the personality of the bird&quot; to Mayles, while the witch Gruntilda was inspired by Grotbags from the &quot;Grotbags&quot; ITV television series.

=== Writing and humour ===
&quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was designed to appeal players of all ages in a similar vein to Disney films. According to Rare, &quot;We wanted the characters to primarily appeal to a younger audience but, at the same time, give them enough humour and attitude not to discourage older players.&quot; One major goal was for everything to have personality, down to the collectables, which includes items with eyes and eggs that bounce up and down. Another was its style of humour that distinguished it from other platform games, which Mayles described as &quot;very dry, very typically British, slightly sarcastic, happy to poke fun at ourselves.&quot; All the characters, in particular, &quot;basically had something wrong with them&quot;, Mayles explained. &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; continues the trend of Rare games with characters titled &quot;[name] the [animal/object]&quot;, the name of the animal or object occasionally rhyming with the name, for example Mumbo Jumbo.

The developers wanted the game to be character-driven, and characters were conceived on the spot, sometimes in relation to design decisions. For example, Mumbo Jumbo originated simply as a way to include animal transformations and for character dynamics to exist between Banjo, Kazooie, and another; Banjo is friendly with Mumbo, but Kazooie cannot stand him. Some jiggies also require solving certain characters&#x27; &quot;real world problems&quot; in order to collect. Most of the dialogue was ad-libbed, and a challenge for the designers was to remember the personalities and mindsets of the characters while doing so. The environment of the development farm was dominated by the workers playing various pranks and gags on each other, such as playing a monkey sound Robin Beanland sampled very loudly, pulling each others&#x27; shorts down while being smacked in the face, and being called names such as &quot;Winky Boy,&quot; &quot;the Shine,&quot; and &quot;the Judge.&quot; This bled into the style of humour of the final product. They tried to push the E rating of the Entertainment Software Rating Board with Kazooie&#x27;s sarcastic remarks; a few of them were rejected.

=== Rejected concepts and features ===
Rare originally planned to include a multiplayer mode and more worlds, such as a mine level, but these were not implemented due to time constraints; some were included in the sequel &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; (2000). Connell recalled encountering the team working on a four-player mode only three weeks before Nintendo&#x27;s approval. Developers were also conflicted between each other whether to create sections where Banjo and Kazooie would be separate from one another, but they ultimately decided it would be &quot;too much.&quot; This was another mechanic transferred to &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;.

One scrapped feature, &quot;Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop&quot;, would have allowed &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; to interact with &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; (1999), &quot;Jet Force Gemini&quot; (1999), &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; (2000), &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; (2000), and &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot; (2001). During development, Rare discovered the Nintendo 64 retained flash memory for several seconds after a cartridge&#x27;s removal. They implemented a feature whereby removing a cartridge and quickly inserting the &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; cartridge, while the other game&#x27;s memory was still in the console, would unlock bonus content. Nintendo requested Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop&#x27;s removal when Rare submitted &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; for approval. Nintendo was concerned the Nintendo 64 would not retain RDRAM long enough for the feature to work and that it could potentially damage consoles. Specifically, Nintendo 64 models produced after &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; release reduced the amount of time the console retained flash memory, making Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop nearly impossible to activate as intended.

Preview coverage from July and August 1997 revealed that Tooty was originally Banjo&#x27;s girlfriend Piccolo, and that there were 16 levels accessed via jiggies instead of nine. An animation that did not make the released game was named &quot;cack bad egg&quot;, and depicts Kazooie laying a gassy rotten egg Banjo reacts to. Another rejected concept was another stage of the final boss, where Gruntilda turned Banjo into a frog.

=== Visuals and levels ===
&quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was developed on a Silicon Graphics workstation. It employs an advanced technique to render its graphics. The in-game characters were created with minimal amounts of texturing so they could have a sharp and clean look, while the backgrounds use very large textures split into 64×64 pieces, which was the largest texture size the Nintendo 64 could render. A &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; preview also emphasized its exploitation of the console&#x27;s LOD management and anti-aliasing. The fact that the player could be transformed into small creatures was implemented to give some of the worlds a different sense of scale. A 2018 &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; feature discussed how the size and scope of the worlds took advantage of the limited memory and were significant in 3D video games at the time, citing the different seasons in Click Clock Wood, the organ section in Mad Monster Mansion, and Freezeezy Peak&#x27;s size.

Because the advanced graphics technique caused significant memory fragmentation issues, the developers created a proprietary system that could &quot;reshuffle&quot; memory as players played through the game. More specifically, the programmers centred on culling parts of the world that were not viewable from the perspective. Sutherland and Mayles have admitted in interviews that they do not perceive the practice as being commonplace in the Nintendo 64 library. The designers began implementing this when designing Treasure Trove Cove, which is built around a massive rock structure. Mayles looks back fondly on the method, elaborating that an unintentional consequence was that they focused on hiding objects, which created mystery and intrigue, incentivizing the player to explore the environment to find them. The combination of the big shark Clanker and the player&#x27;s interaction with him was noted by &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; as pushing the console, causing issues of frame rate.

Although borrowing similar themes to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, such as desert, ice and haunted house, the worlds were intended to be &quot;a lot more grounded in reality&quot;. The worlds were intended to be diverse in theme to give the player new experiences and emotions. Mayles&#x27; view was that what a player feels swimming in the water of an island is different from being at a haunted mansion. To conceive them, a theme was chosen first, and then all the traits and design choices, including the animal Mumbo would transform Banjo and Kazooie into, associated with it. His favourite stage was Rusty Bucket Bay, for its design being mostly around a single ship, and the extreme pace and difficulty of the ship&#x27;s interior. The incorporation of a trivia game at the end was a method of making &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; unique; the section was initially planned to only have a few questions for the player to ask, but became a massive board game in the end.

Music and sound effects were entirely done by Grant Kirkhope. Although &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was not his first project for Rare, as he previously converted David Wise&#x27;s score for &quot;Diddy&#x27;s Kong Quest&quot; to a Game Boy port and helped on &quot;Goldeneye 007&quot; (1997), it was the first time he worked on all music and sound effects for a game. He conceived &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;″s musical style after listening to Danny Elfman&#x27;s score for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988). As he explained the philosophy, &quot;I realized you can use really dark chords with dark harmonies, and as long as the rhythm&#x27;s quite comical it&#x27;s not going to scare the kids&quot;. The chord progression for Mad Monster Mansion was influenced by another Elfman score, that of the 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot;, specifically the chord progression for the titular character&#x27;s moments in the cathedral. The compositions feature several instances of tritone to reflect the contrasts between Banjo and Kazooie&#x27;s character, something Kirkhope conceived when composing the music for Mumbo&#x27;s Mountain. At one point when the developers were nearly done with the game, Chris Stamper decided that he didn&#x27;t like the first two level tunes for Mumbo&#x27;s Mountain and Treasure Trove Cove, so Kirkhope had to change them quickly. The original tune for Mumbo&#x27;s Mountain would be used inside the termite hill, with Kirkhope thinking that it &quot;suited the place&quot;. The original tune for Treasure Trove Cove had a middle section inspired by the Fat Boys and the Beach Boys&#x27; cover of &quot;Wipe Out&quot; by the Surfaris.

&quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; is significant for its introduction of vertical remixing to video games; various sound layers of the same composition fade in and out depending on which area the player has moved to, such as going from above ground to under water. This came from Mayles commanding Kirkhope to get a step beyond the early 1990s LucasArts&#x27; iMUSE, which faded between themes instead of sound layers. Animal sound effects are also occasionally instruments.

After &quot;Dream&quot; was disbanded, Rare was focused on getting &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; finished as much as possible. One way to do this was to reject &quot;Dream&quot;″s pre-recorded speech and have the dialogue be presented in text; however, they still wanted the feeling of speech. As a comprise, all the characters have their voices executed via &quot;mumbling&quot;, with text presenting dialogue. This choice was made to convey their personalities without them actually speaking, as Rare felt the actual speech &quot;could ruin the player&#x27;s perception of the characters.&quot; Banjo, Kazooie, and other characters such as Clanker, the Ancient Ones and Napper (Banjo&#x27;s voice pitch-shifted down to save space on the cartridge) were performed by Sutherland, who voiced Edison in &quot;Dream&quot;. Some of Edison&#x27;s voice clips, such as &quot;Guh-huh!&quot;, were re-used for Banjo. Kirkhope performed the voices of Mumbo Jumbo, the Jinjos, the Mumbo Token, the Flower Urns, and most of the villains, including Conga, the Gravestones and Gruntlings. Mumbo&#x27;s speech was made up of cut-up samples of Kirkhope&#x27;s voice that would later be used on the soundtrack of the Mayahem Temple level in the game&#x27;s sequel &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;, which Kirkhope revealed in an episode of &quot;Game Grumps&quot; was actually him saying, &quot;Come and have a go if you think you&#x27;re hard enough,&quot; a famous English football chant. According to Kirkhope, Mumbo&#x27;s &quot;Oomenacka&quot; came from something that Kirkhope said in a doctor&#x27;s surgery while having his groin examined. He originally said, &quot;Oh, me knacker,&quot; &quot;knackers&quot; being a British slang word for &quot;testicles&quot;. Chris Seavor provided the voice of Gruntilda, Eveline Novakovic voiced Tooty and Brentilda, and Bottles and Rubee were voiced by artist Lee Ray, who voiced Captain Blackeye in &quot;Dream&quot;.

== Release and promotion ==
In June 1997, a working version of the game was shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, where it was officially announced that &quot;Dream&quot; had become &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. The panel, for what was considered by &quot;64&quot; to be Nintendo&#x27;s flagship game at the event, featured several big machines and sculptures, such as those for Banjo and Mumbo Jumbo. The whole team got to attend for the game&#x27;s unveiling, all feeling proud of their work. The Nintendo 64 games presented at E3 were lauded by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; as &quot;pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment, innovation, and intensity&quot;. &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was a major example, highlighting how its advanced technology created a Disney-esque &quot;rich, animated world full of fun animals and great music&quot;, visuals containing &quot;rich textures, creative lighting,&quot; and dynamic music. The reaction from gamers and critics towards the game was generally positive, &quot;64&quot; magazine predicting it to be &quot;the biggest hit of the year.&quot; However, it was also met with skepticism as a rip-off of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and overly cute, and despised its new name. The gaming community was also mystified by some of its concepts, such as the usage of a bird-bear duo for a &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;-esque genre, fart sound effects for speech, and Kazooie pooping out eggs as an attack.

The game was then presented at the 1997 annual Nintendo Space World event, where the first five worlds were playable. Its panel had women that were dressed up as Banjo with shirts on. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; gave a glowing review of the panel, admitting it to be the event&#x27;s most absorbing experience, even moreso than the &quot;Zelda&quot; game that got the most attention from other gamers and journalists. They considered the worlds immersive due to its &quot;graphical opulence,&quot; such as the &quot;incredibly realistic ripples&quot; on the water, and choice of environments &quot;realistic&quot; even considering the cartoony characters. They also positively commented on its implementation of the dual-character mechanic (particularly how certain sections require a specific character unlike other games).

&quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was initially scheduled for a release in November 1997, in the US 24 November, but was delayed to give developers more time for polish. When Rare met Nintendo of America&#x27;s Howard Lincoln at E3 1997, he was against a delay, complaining: &quot;We&#x27;ve committed $20 million to this campaign&quot;. To fill that year&#x27;s Christmas schedule, Lincoln told Rare to include &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; characters in an &quot;R.C. Pro-Am&quot; game they were developing at the time, turning it into &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; (1997). &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; &quot;something of a testing ground for Rare&#x27;s [Nintendo 64]-era heroes&quot;, as it included Banjo and Conker as playable characters prior to featuring in their own games. In the following months, Rare released screenshots at such a rate that by May 1998, &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; suspected the game was completed besides testing.

&quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was released on 29 June 1998 in North America, 17 July 1998 in Europe, Australia in August 1998, and 6 December 1998 in Japan as . The Japan date was shifted multiple times, set to be released before other territories in January 1998 as of November 1997, and moved to April months later. The UK date was also set to 16 March 1998 as of Christmas 1997, before being moved to July two months later. In Europe, the game was released in the summer, an active season for Nintendo 64 releases that followed a scarce period and included games of various genres, such as &quot;Quest 64&quot; (1998), &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; (1998), &quot;Off Road Challenge&quot; (1998), &quot;Dezaemon 3D&quot; (1998) and &quot;Virtual Chess 64&quot; (1998). It had a marketing budget of $10 million.

&quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; performed well in both the UK and US. Virgin Megastore reported that the game was topping the UK charts as of 21 September 1998. In Japan, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; entered &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s Top 10 sales charts for the week ending 13 December 1998, selling 74,000 copies for a total of 117,399. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, the game took home a &quot;Gold&quot; prize for revenues above €26 million in the European Union during 1998. As of March 2003, the game had sold more than 405,000 units in Japan. As of December 2007, it had sold more than 1.8 million copies in the US. As of 2021, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; worldwide sales were 3 million, making it the tenth highest-grossing Nintendo 64 game.

== Reception ==
&quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; garnered critical acclaim upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, it garnered a weighted average of 92, based on 19 entries. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; (CVG) and &quot;GamePro&quot; provided prefect scores (it was one of &quot;CVG&quot;″s &quot;high five!&quot; recommendations, which was for games scored five hands out of five), while ratings of reviews from sources like &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (EGM), &quot;GameSpot&quot;, and &quot;IGN&quot; were extremely close. It was also the &quot;Game of the Month&quot; for &quot;Hyper&quot;. Contemporaneous reviews constantly called &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; the best platform and action-adventure game at the time, surpassing &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, and the best game on the Nintendo 64, a console that was generally &quot;weak&quot; with adventure and platform games according to Chris Harding of &quot;Adrenaline Vault&quot;.

Critics noted the game&#x27;s similarities to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; in its controls, cute character design, level themes like water, haunted house and snow, the incorporation of an overworld that connects stages, and movements like the butt stomp and back jump. However, it was also celebrated for building off of what made &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; successful, in terms of its technical aspects, gameplay ideas, options of camera angles, animations, player characters&#x27; abilities, polygons, non-linear world design, varied, colourful and realistic textures, amount of tasks, and the scale, size, detail and amount of interactive characters of the 3D worlds. It was to a point where &quot;Consoles +&quot; considered &quot;Banjo Kazooie&quot; &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;″s spiritual successor. The game&#x27;s little originality was also brought up but factored differently between opinions. Some were apathetic, such as &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jeff Gerstmann who elaborated that it simply &quot;makes the logical progressions you would expect Nintendo to make.&quot; However, others were let down, &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; arguing only ten challenges to collect jiggies were innovative. The same magazine argued it was only better in terms on visuals but not gameplay, in a review published in an issue preceded by two issues that predicted it to be the best game of the summer and &quot;the first real &quot;Mario&quot;-beater.&quot;

&quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was complimented for the utilization of simultaneous control of two characters with different abilities. &quot;Adrenaline Vault&quot; and &quot;EGM&quot; called it a genius design choice, the former publication reasoning that it made the gameplay &quot;stylistic&quot; and rewarded players for creative manoeuvring. &quot;IGN&quot; was entertained by the interactions between the two characters, and highlighted the suitability of the objectives to their abilities and the balance of segments that require one of them, calling it &quot;addictive&quot;. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; enjoyed that the level design not only suited the combination of both characters&#x27; abilities, but also required them. Lucas noted the adaptiveness of the controls, especially for players of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, and the flexibility and freedom of movement the two-character mechanic provided, which was also praised by &quot;Nintendo Acción&quot;. &quot;Hyper&quot;″s Cam Shea also reported the controls as intuitive, as well as responsive, and enthusiastically wrote the incoporation of several abilities resulted in a variety of challenges and puzzles, making for an &quot;action packed&quot; experience. Lucas&#x27; favorite ability was Kazooie&#x27;s flying, calling the &quot;most rewarding move,&quot; &quot;a magnificent sensation,&quot; and the beak attack &quot;incredibly fun.&quot; Lucas also noted how the learning of moves correlated with the increase in difficulty. Harding opined the jumping and movement was well-above most other video games. The new moves he cited as enjoying included the beak-pecking, the attack during Kazooie&#x27;s flying, and the somersault roll, and exuberantly called playing as the animal forms &quot;a riot.&quot;

Critics suggested potentially high amounts of time to complete the game, estimates ranging from 35–50 hours, which was attributed to the world size, amount of objectives, challenge of the later levels, and backtracking. &quot;GamePro&quot; stated the amount of tasks and big size surpassed most other consoles games at the time. &quot;EGM&quot;″s testimony stated &quot;a feeling of great depth&quot; and interactive-ness, filled with large parts of the world that &quot;floors&quot; the player, such as the shark Clanker and a large snowmen&#x27;s scarf to slide on.&quot; Critics from &quot;Hyper&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot; praised the decision to have action segments in nearly all areas, removing any tedium of exploring the non-linear worlds. &quot;Joystick&quot; also highlighted the non-linear progression, and the amount of &quot;twists and turns&quot; that resulted from it. Critics Victor Lucas and Alex Huhtala were stunned by the size of the areas, especially the overworld that they considered the size of a single game, where &quot;it takes ages just to get from one level entrance to another.&quot; &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; wrote that the collectables, mysterious part of the stages and a timer feature incentivizing thinking of how to beat the game quicker contributed to the replay value. The huge amount of collectibles in comparison to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, in spite of the lesser number of worlds, was also highlighted. Lucas argued it was a bit excessive, joking that &quot;you&#x27;re going to know what it feels like to be a part of the Central Park Trash Collection Unit.&quot; As he summarized, &quot;Expect to be lost, expect to be confused, expect to be frustrated and dammit, expect to be addicted and entertained.&quot; Harding found the overall experience &quot;wonderfully addictive and a great challenge,&quot; but argued that the puzzles and bosses, although &quot;very intelligent and creative,&quot; were not as impressive or &quot;ingeniously fun&quot; as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;″s.

&quot;Nintendo Acción&quot;, &quot;EGM&quot; and &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; considered &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;″s graphics the greatest in the N64 library. Shea claimed they set a benchmark for the console, absent of issues of most other games such as repetitive textures, fogging and lagging framerates. According to a &quot;Mega Fun&quot;, the amount of visual detail was unseen in prior 3D games of any other console. The game was highlighted for its effects, such as lighting, water ripples, transparency, sun ray diffraction, and leaves falling, and textures, such as lava, grass, stone, cobwebs, and rust on the pipes; critics claimed players would notice them before entering the actual levels. Shea wrote a paragraph about the amount of detail on the ripples, occurring from the water dripplets that fly through the air when Banjo jumps in and from water bubbles underwater. The absence of fog was also highlighted, Shea explaining that it was easier to sense the landscapes&#x27; big scale and size. Any graphical issues were reported as trivial, including slight frame rate drops as a result of an overwhelming amount of assets, objects not appearing at distances when on camera, and a few moments of clipping. &quot;Hyper&quot; wrote that, went objects close-by did not render, they were hard to notice and fade in smoothly when coming close to them. Its characters were noted as more rounded and similar to an animated film or cartoon. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; called Rusty Bucket Bay the level with the best visuals, although lauded the &quot;superb atmosphere&quot; of Mad Monster Mansion, citing its enemies and &quot;dusky lighting effects.&quot; They also lauded the haunted world&#x27;s ability to &quot;bustles with action and colour&quot; in spite of its darkness, and praised Click Clock Wood as &quot;beautifully worked out and one of the most ambitious parts of the whole game.&quot; The magazine reported being so absorbed by the 3D worlds that they played for 16 hours straight. Mad Monster Mansion was called the &quot;coolest&quot; by &quot;64&quot; magazine, enjoying an overhead view the player gets while on top of the house.

&quot;IGN&quot; was astonished by the attention to detail to all aspects of the experience, such as the interface of the save file options, which consists of Banjo and Kazooie performing different actions, such as playing a Game Boy. As they explained, &quot;It&#x27;s a very unnecessary interface that many developers wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with, but Rare has gone the extra mile to give the game that much more character.&quot; Some critics argued &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; would appeal to all ages. However, some were turned off by the cuteness, which &quot;Video Games&quot; felt would alienate any player above 12, and Lucas argued was a poor choice for a game released in a market oversaturated with cute products. Critics praised the personality, dialogue, and voice method of the characters, &quot;GameSpot&quot; comparing the way of speaking to Charlie Brown&#x27;s teacher. Gruntilda&#x27;s taunts were among the highlighted examples of the game&#x27;s dialogue and humour by sources as &quot;Mega Fun&quot;, which noted the distinctiveness of its British sense of humour. Shea also noted Brentilda&#x27;s secrets about Gruntilda, Kazooie&#x27;s wisecracks against Bottles, and a line Mumbo says after accidentally transforming Banjo and Kazooie into a washing machine, &quot;&quot;Mumbo&#x27;s loincloth dirty. You wash?&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; liked the characters as exuberating &quot;more of a loud-mouthed attitude than Mario and crew.&quot; Shea called the game&#x27;s conclusion &quot;one of the most creative and satisfying endings yet seen in a platformer.&quot; Harding was mixed on the characters. He argued the titular Bear had more personality than the Mario brothers, and cited &quot;timeless encounters with such creatures as the orange-throwing gorilla and the blubbering hippopotamus.&quot; However, he also disliked some characters, such as dancing houses and onions, as weirdly-designed, unsuitable to the stages they were in, and lacking the appeal of enemies like the Bom-ombs in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; praised the characters as &quot;genuinely appealing&quot; and well-designed, but felt there were &quot;some moments of cloying cuteness&quot; and criticized characters that simply consist of eyes on an object—&quot;we&#x27;re not sure that just sticking a pair of eyes on any inanimate object you fancy qualifies as a characterisation.&quot; &quot;EGM&quot; also admitted to not caring about Banjo as a character. A huge detractor in this aspect was Lucas. He condemned the characters in it and &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; as &quot;so half-baked and overtly cliched they almost sabotage the ingenuity of the titles they belong to.&quot; He was especially desensitized by the &quot;regurgitated, ill conceived, and down right offensive&quot; arc and humour of Gruntilda, where she tries to look like &quot;the hottest looking old witch Cosmopolitan magazine has ever seen&quot; and is mocked for her weight and unattractiveness: &quot;I was expecting to be charmed by some truly witty English entendres and non-sequitors but instead, I was bludgeoned by fat jokes and lots of silliness about Gruntilda being a nose picker.&quot;

The music and sound effects were well-received, highlighted for the dynamic music component which contributed to the atmosphere; &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; stated it gave the game &quot;far more atmosphere than any streaming CD music could ever manage.&quot; The borrowing of melodies from children&#x27;s songs, such as &quot;Teddy Bears&#x27; Picnic&quot; for Gruntilda&#x27;s Lair, were also noted. Harding and Shea was amazed by the detail in the sound effects, down to the biting and swimming sounds of the sharks and piranhas being dissimillar, and squelsh sounds occurring when Banjo steps on goop.

The most-critique&#x27;d aspect was the camera. Reviewers positively noted the amount of control the player had over it. However, they were critical of the fixed viewpoints, such as those for underwater sections and tight areas that obscured items from the main field of view, and instances where the camera gets stuck on a wall. &quot;Hyper&quot; and &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; found most of the fixed viewpoints tolerable, and appreciated the manual camera control. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Acción&quot; found the camera control intuitive, but felt &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was better in terms of the camera.

== Accolades ==
In 1999, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; received two awards during the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards: &quot;Console Action Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics&quot;; it also received nominations for &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Console Adventure Game of the Year&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; awarded the game Overall Best Graphics of 1998, Best Texture Design of 1998, and Best Music of 1998.

== Legacy ==
=== Sequels and re-releases ===

A sequel, &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;, was released for the Nintendo 64 in 2000 and largely adopts the gameplay mechanics of its predecessor. The &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; series continued to be developed with the release of &quot;Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Banjo-Pilot&quot; for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 and 2005, respectively. The characters Banjo and Kazooie proved to be popular and were once seen as a potential mascot for the Xbox 360 console. A third main game, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts&quot;, was released for the Xbox 360 in 2008. &quot;Nuts &amp; Bolts&quot; is a departure from its predecessors and involves the player building vehicles of all shapes and sizes to complete challenges.

An Xbox Live Arcade version of &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, developed by 4J Studios, was released for the Xbox 360 on 26 November 2008. This version runs in a full widescreen mode with an updated 1080p resolution, cleaner audio and consistent frame rate, includes achievements, and supports the &quot;Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop&quot; connectivity that was incomplete in the Nintendo 64 game, used now to unlock features in both &quot;Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts&quot; and the then-upcoming Xbox Live Arcade version of &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;. The Xbox Live Arcade version was generally well received by critics, featuring an aggregate score of 77 out of 100 at Metacritic and generally considered a solid revival of a classic. &quot;TeamXbox&quot; praised its controls as very responsive in comparison to most other XBLA re-releases. However, the port also reminded them of the game&#x27;s original issues, especially with the camera, such as the inability to look up high enough, resulting in several items that are not seen on screen, and the camera flipping at inopportune moments. &quot;PALGN&quot; reported brief pauses in one of Gruntilda&#x27;s cutscenes and returns to the hub world, and disappearances of collectables like musical notes and jiggies. &quot;PALGN&quot; was also disappointed in the small amount of rewards provided by the Stop &#x27;n Swap feature for &quot;Nuts &amp; Bolts&quot;, only a few vehicle accessories. In 2009, IGN ranked it seventh on its list of Top 10 Xbox Live Arcade Games. In 2015, the Xbox Live Arcade version became one of the first backwards compatible titles for Xbox One, and was re-released as part of the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; video game compilation. In 2019, this version was enhanced to run at native 4K resolution on Xbox One.

A spiritual successor to &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, &quot;Yooka-Laylee&quot;, was released in 2017. Elements, largely coming from &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, were released as downloadable content for the crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; on 4 September 2019, including Banjo and Kazooie as a tag team of playable fighters and a stage based on Spiral Mountain, a location in the game. &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was added to the Nintendo Switch Online library of Nintendo 64 games on 20 January 2022, marking its first re-release on a Nintendo console.

In 2024, a fan fully decompiled the original ROM image into C source code. Unofficial ports of the game to various platforms are expected to come.

=== Retrospective reception ===
&quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; is occasionally included in &quot;best games&quot; lists by video game publications. In terms of best all-time Nintendo 64 entries, it was ranked number seven on IGN&#x27;s 2000 list, six on &quot;NME&quot;″s 2017 list and &quot;Video Games Chronicle&quot;″s 2021 list (where it tied with &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;), four on a 2022 &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; list, five by &quot;Digital Spy&quot; in 2017, eight on rankings by Shacknews in 2021 and GamesRadar in 2022, 13 by SVG.com in 2022, and two on a 2022 &quot;Destructoid&quot; top-five article. As Mark Beaumont jested, &quot;A bear with a bird rucksack runs around a 3D platform jungle making some of the most annoying noises this side of the guy from Interpol singing – and somehow this made for one of the most engrossing games of a generation.&quot; It also appeared on unranked N64 game lists, such as in 2014 by &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, in 2021 by &quot;PC Magazine&quot; and 2022 by news.com.au and &quot;GameSpot&quot;. &quot;Shacknews&quot; called it the fifth best Rare game in 2018, while &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Vulture&quot; website, in 2022, listed it as one of &quot;The 25 Best Games on Nintendo Switch Online.&quot; In 2009, &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked the game 71st in their list of the Top 100 Games Of All Time. The same year, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 36th in a list of greatest Nintendo games. In 2021, it ranked number 21 on &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;″s special edition of &quot;100 Games To Play Before You Die: Nintendo Consoles Edition&quot;.

According to &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s 10/10 review of the Switch re-release, the game was &quot;a benchmark for 3D platforming excellence that has rarely been replicated since.&quot; Claims of &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; being greater or a close second to &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, as well as building off already-established aspects of the 3D platform game, continue in writings by retrospective journalists. Positives have been commonly cited toward its British sarcastic humour, which has been suggested to distinguish it from other games of its kind released in the same generation, as well as its graphics, controls, soundtrack, challenge, variety, likeable characters, and atmosphere, scope and design of its levels. &quot;news.com.au&quot; reasoned the &quot;charming characters and memorable moments&quot; made up for the scale being slightly less than &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Darryn Bonthuys wrote it &quot;was nearly perfect, a game that hit the Goldilocks zone of size, fun, and challenge with its design, while also offering a soundtrack that would make you tap holes in your floor.&quot; The game is frequently described as a capturer of hearts and spirits, &quot;SVG.com&quot; and &quot;news.com.au&quot; stating it was the only entry in the series to do so.

Opinions on how well &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; has aged differ. Reviews of the XBLA port from &quot;Eurogamer&quot; and IGN considered it outdated in its gameplay style and issues related to the controls and camera. Others, however, argue the game still holds up and is one of very few retro 3D platformers to do so, which was expressed as early as 2000 by Matt Casamassina and as late as 2022 by long-time video game journalist Chris Scullion&#x27;s book &quot;Jumping for Joy: The History of Platform Video Games&quot;. &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; has also been cited as part of a 1990s golden age of Rare entries that showed a frequency and strong devotion to quality in the platform and shooter genres, which began with &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; and mostly encompassed the Nintendo 64. &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; has been the most acclaimed of these games. Victor Lucas, reviewing the game for &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; upon its release, noticed it was a part of Rare&#x27;s &quot;bombardment of triple A games&quot;, which also included &quot;Goldeneye 007&quot;, &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot; and (at the time) the upcoming &quot;Conker&quot; game.

=== Influence ===
Some critics noted the importance of &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;″s indication that Nintendo&#x27;s EAD was not the only developer to pull off a first-rate 3D platformer. &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was also one of the most notable products of a platform-adventure trend of games that emphasized exploration, increasing abilities of the player character, and inventory management. It reached its zenith in the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation era, but declined to a point where they were near non-existent in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 generation of gaming, outside of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; series. Kirkhope recalled Rare getting tired of making &quot;Banjo&quot; games after &quot;Tooie&quot;, contributed by Rare&#x27;s general philosophy being against sequels.

A frequently-cited reason for the decline, which &quot;Kotaku&quot; and &quot;The Ringer&quot; have suggested, was the overwhelming amount of collectables, of which Rare&#x27;s 3D platformers were particularly notorious. Although &quot;Kotaku&quot; and Kirkhope considered items to obtain the most excessive on &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; and &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;″s &quot;charming-if-pushing-it collecting of items&quot; was cited as an example, its success laying a collect-a-thon ground for other games in the genre to distort. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; journalist Darren Jones, conversely, felt the game struck the perfect balance of collectables. Reviews of the 2008 XBLA port provided more reasons. Meghan Watt of &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; argued players had less tolerance for limited lives and &quot;endless hint-free puzzles&quot;, while IGN suggested, &quot;Most gamers have had their fill of simple fetch and hop games and like a bit more action and drama on their consoles.&quot;

The platform trend was revitalized in the mid-2010s with the release of remakes of platform games like &quot;Spyro Reignited Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy&quot; and indie games like &quot;A Hat of Time&quot; (all released in 2017), which was marketed as being influenced by &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. The game&#x27;s developer, Jonas Kaerlev, explained that his goal was to magnify the positives of the 1998 N64 game, including exploration, charm, and puzzle-solving, while mitigating its flaws, such as endless collecting and a camera. He admitted two levels explicitly based on &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; segments, a race with another character and a ticket collection, were removed due to poor test player reception. The resurgence of these games as well as the announcement of a &quot;Battletoads&quot; remake influenced speculation of another game in the &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; series, Mayles in 2018 revealing it from &quot;aggrieved people on Twitter.&quot;

As one of the earliest platformers, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; was noted by &quot;The Ringer&quot; and Kaerlev, for a major difference from the &quot;Mario&quot; series it took influence from: the rejection of a start-to-end structure in favor of exploration. Many of the 3D &quot;Mario&quot; games continued to follow their linear formula until &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; (2017), where the player can explore the world without a time limit and remains in it after collecting a power moon. Additionally, &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s capture mechanic, where Mario turns into whatever object or animal it latches onto, is similar to Mumbo&#x27;s animal transformations in &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; and &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;. Nintendo never publicized if they took inspiration from the &quot;Banjo&quot; games. As Mayles responded, &quot;We took enough influences from Nintendo&#x27;s games, so if they were influenced by Banjo, then that&#x27;s kind of a nice thing.&quot;

<text>Banjo-Tooie is a 2000 platform game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 console. It is the second game in the &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; series and the sequel to &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. The game follows the returning protagonists Banjo and Kazooie as they attempt to stop the plans of the witch Gruntilda and two of her sisters, who intend to vaporise the inhabitants of the game&#x27;s island setting. The game features worlds significantly larger than those of its predecessor, requiring the player to complete challenges such as solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, collecting items, and defeating opponents. It also includes a Widescreen format, and a multiplayer mode in which up to four players can compete in several minigames repurposed from the main campaign.

Development of the game started in June 1998, directly after the release of its predecessor. Several new features were cut from the game due to time constraints and limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. It is the final &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; game to be released by Nintendo prior to Rare&#x27;s purchase by Microsoft. Upon release, &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; received critical acclaim, with praise for its graphics and the size of its worlds; however, the game&#x27;s inconsistent frame rate was criticized. In 2009, a port developed by 4J Studios was released as an Xbox Live Arcade game for the Xbox 360. The game was also included in the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; video game compilation, released for the Xbox One in 2015. The game was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on 25 October 2024, marking its first re-release on a Nintendo console.

==Gameplay==

Similar to its predecessor &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; is a single-player platform game in which the protagonists are controlled from a third-person perspective. Carrying over most of the mechanics and concepts established in its predecessor, the game features three-dimensional worlds consisting of various platforming challenges and puzzles, with a notable increased focus on puzzle-solving over the worlds of &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. These challenges, along with exploration, usually reward the player with collectible items that permit progression to later challenges and worlds. Among the items are golden jigsaw pieces, called Jiggies, that are used to permit entry to new worlds; instead of exploring the game&#x27;s overworld in search of incomplete puzzle boards as in &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, a singular board is used within a temple where a character named Master Jiggywiggy resides, that can only be accessed if the player has obtained the number of Jiggies required to open a new world. A timed puzzle-completion challenge can then be played, after which Jiggywiggy grants access to the world. Each puzzle challenge requires more Jiggies than the last.

Musical notes return in &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;, but are now used to learn new moves from Bottles&#x27; brother, a drill sergeant named Jamjars, who assumes Bottles&#x27; role from the first game. All of Banjo and Kazooie&#x27;s moves from the first game are immediately accessible in &quot;Tooie&quot;, and the player can acquire several new moves such as first-person aiming, new egg types, and the ability to play as Banjo and Kazooie separately, with each gaining moves they can only use while on their own. Empty honeycomb pieces and Jinjos return as well, effectively retaining the functions they had in &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. Mumbo Jumbo reappears in this game as a playable character who can venture out into each world and use specific magic spells to help Banjo and Kazooie. Taking over Mumbo&#x27;s previous role of transforming the duo into different forms is Humba Wumba, a Native American shaman who acts as Mumbo&#x27;s rival. Small magical creatures called &quot;Glowbos&quot; are required payment for the shamans&#x27; services.

A mechanic introduced in &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; is the direct connections between its worlds. In &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, the titular duo were magically transported to each world via special doors in Gruntilda&#x27;s Lair, with said worlds effectively existing in vacuums, but in this game, almost every world is physically connected to others at multiple points, and is effectively an extension of the overworld. In addition, a train named Chuffy can be used to migrate Banjo, Kazooie, and some minor characters between worlds which contain stations. In conjunction with these additions, required backtracking and puzzle-solving across several worlds constitute many of &quot;Tooie&quot;&#x27;s challenges. The game includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can play a repurposed competition mode for each of the game&#x27;s single-player challenges. These include first-person shooting, kickball, and several other minigames.

==Plot==
Two years after Gruntilda&#x27;s defeat, Banjo and Kazooie are playing poker with Mumbo Jumbo and Bottles. Outside, two of Gruntilda&#x27;s sisters, Mingella and Blobbelda, use their large &quot;HAG 1&quot; digging machine to enter Spiral Mountain. They destroy the boulder trapping Gruntilda, finding that she has rotted into a living skeleton while underground. Seeking revenge, Gruntilda destroys Banjo&#x27;s house with a spell before fleeing with her sisters. Mumbo witnesses Gruntilda&#x27;s return and escapes with Banjo and Kazooie, but Gruntilda herself catches Bottles in the blast radius and kills him as he ignores the warnings given to him. His friends resolve to defeat Gruntilda again, this time at the request of his ghost, to find a way to resurrect him.

Following the witches&#x27; trail, Banjo and Kazooie arrive at Jinjo Village. There, King Jingaling, king of the Jinjos, explains that his subjects were frightened away by the &quot;HAG 1&quot; and scattered throughout the Isle O&#x27; Hags, the game&#x27;s overworld. He gives the two their first Jiggy as a reward for rescuing his subjects in advance. Meanwhile, Gruntilda&#x27;s sisters introduce her to a device called the &quot;Big-O-Blaster&quot; (B.O.B.), capable of extracting &quot;life force&quot; from any given target. They test B.O.B. on King Jingaling and he becomes a zombie after Gruntilda accuses him of being a traitor and before she plans to charge B.O.B. long enough to blast the entire island and use the stolen life force to restore her body. The witch&#x27;s most loyal henchman, Klungo, is sent out to hinder Banjo and Kazooie&#x27;s progress, but after losing to them several times, resulting in beatings from Gruntilda, Klungo abandons her and sides with the protagonists. Banjo and Kazooie continue their journey, meeting new allies along the way such as Bottles&#x27; drill sergeant brother Jamjars, who teaches them new moves, and the Native American shaman Humba Wumba, a bitter rival of Mumbo who aids the duo with new magical transformations.

Within Gruntilda&#x27;s fortress, Cauldron Keep, Banjo and Kazooie compete with Mingella and Blobbelda in a trivia game show hosted by Gruntilda similar to that of the first game, in which losing competitors are flattened under one-ton weights. The two sisters are crushed after losing to Banjo and Kazooie, but Gruntilda escapes. Banjo and Kazooie then reverse the effects of B.O.B., resurrecting both King Jingaling and Bottles, who celebrate at Bottles&#x27; house along with Klungo. Banjo and Kazooie fight Gruntilda and the &quot;HAG 1&quot; atop her fortress and they defeat her again when she drops her most powerful magic spell inside the &quot;HAG 1&quot; cockpit, causing the entire machine to explode, reducing Gruntilda to nothing more than her head. The two return to Bottles&#x27; house with Jamjars, Mumbo, and Humba Wumba, to find that, much to their disappointment, the celebration has ended without them. They then head to the top of Cauldron Keep and play a game of hacky sack with Gruntilda&#x27;s head, who swears revenge against Banjo and Kazooie once again.

==Development==
&quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; was developed by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. Development of the game started in June 1998. Some features that were originally cut during the development of &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, such as some of its worlds and a multiplayer game mode, were instead integrated into &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;. An additional world set in a castle was planned, but due to time constraints, it was scrapped during development and assets from it were used in constructing Cauldron Keep. The game features roughly 150 total characters, including enemies and non-playable characters.

Originally, Rare planned to include an additional mode called &quot;Bottles&#x27; Revenge&quot; in which a second player could play as an undead version of Bottles and take control of enemy characters, including bosses, to hinder the duo in their quest, with the players swapping roles if the enemy character managed to defeat Banjo and Kazooie. The idea was ultimately scrapped because the developers ran out of time to debug controlling bosses, despite admitting that &quot;it did work rather well;&quot; the only boss that was controllable when the mode was scrapped was the second world boss, &quot;Old King Coal.&quot; However, it later served as the inspiration behind the &quot;Counter-Operative&quot; multiplayer mode in &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. The developers also planned to implement a feature, called &quot;Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop&quot;, that would have allowed data to be transferred from &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot; to &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; so that players could unlock additional bonuses in &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;. However, due to hardware limitations of the Nintendo 64 system, the feature was ultimately dropped. Despite this, Rare resolved to include some of the planned bonuses within the game. The Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop feature was later implemented in the Xbox Live Arcade re-release.

The music was composed by Grant Kirkhope, who previously worked as the main composer for &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;, and &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. As &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; was a larger game than its predecessor, Kirkhope had twice the memory space in the game&#x27;s cartridge for sound effects and music. Kirkhope initially had to pause his work on &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; to work on other projects first, but ultimately the music score for the game was completed on time. Like the game&#x27;s predecessor, the themes heard in the game were designed to be interactive, which dynamically change to reflect the player&#x27;s location. Due to the game having larger memory space, Kirkhope was able to combine two MIDI files to channel different fades of music when the player moves to different locations. The developers initially aimed for a fourth quarter 1999 release, but the game was ultimately delayed. &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; was presented at the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo and first released on 20 November 2000 in North America. Japanese and European releases followed on 27 November 2000 and 12 April 2001, respectively. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak.

The Nintendo 64 version was added to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on 25 October 2024, marking its first re-release on a Nintendo console since Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002.

==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; was critically acclaimed and sold 1.49m worldwide by 2008 &quot;GameRevolution&quot; considered &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; less repetitive than &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; and a worthy successor to &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; referred to &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; as &quot;the perfect cross between &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; and &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;&quot;, noting that it features less backtracking between levels than &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot; does. The publication also stated that the only disappointment was how Rare resolved the &quot;Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop&quot; bonuses. &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; editor Mark Green felt that, although &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; delivers &quot;a decent complement of clever puzzles and enjoyable run-and-jump moments&quot;, it did not feel &quot;as fresh or as exciting&quot; as previous Rare platformers.

The graphics were considered some of the best on the Nintendo 64 due to their rich textures, long drawing distance, and real-time shadow generation, but were criticised for their inconsistent frame rate during certain points in the game. Nevertheless, some critics agreed that the occasional frame rate drops do not hinder the gameplay nor detract from the game significantly. &quot;GameRevolution&quot; said that the game was &quot;beautiful&quot;, but it did not meet the same level of awe as its predecessor. The game was also praised for its humour, with &quot;Edge&quot; commenting that its characters are &quot;impossible to dislike.&quot;

The gameplay was highlighted for the size of the game&#x27;s worlds. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; described &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; as a game that requires a massive time-investment on the player&#x27;s part, saying that &quot;Keeping track of what you can do next, or where you can re-visit to get something new, requires either a photographic memory or copious note-taking&quot;. Similarly, &quot;GamePro&quot; remarked that the game is so large that players might lose their way and forget what they are supposed to do. &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the game&#x27;s level design and progression for constantly requiring players to collect Jiggies. Despite the praise, &quot;Edge&quot; concluded that Rare should have innovated more instead of simply copying the formula of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

At the &quot;GameSpot&quot; Best and Worst of 2000 awards, &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; was awarded Best Platform Game, and was a runner-up in the Best Sound and Best Nintendo 64 Game categories. At the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; received nominations for the &quot;Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Console Action/Adventure&quot; awards.

==Xbox 360 version==
An Xbox Live Arcade version of &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot;, developed by 4J Studios, was released for the Xbox 360 on 29 April 2009. This version features a smoother frame rate and high-definition graphics, and supports the &quot;Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop&quot; connectivity with the Xbox Live Arcade version of its predecessor, allowing players to unlock the bonuses included in the original Nintendo 64 version as well as new content related to the Xbox 360. Using the Stop &#x27;N&#x27; Swop items in the Xbox Live Arcade version of &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; also unlocks additional bonuses in the &quot;L.O.G.&#x27;s Lost Challenges&quot; downloadable content for &quot;Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts&quot;. The Xbox Live Arcade version of &quot;Banjo-Tooie&quot; received mixed to favourable reviews from video game critics, featuring an aggregate score of 73 out of 100 at Metacritic. In 2015, the Xbox Live Arcade version became one of the first backwards compatible titles for Xbox One, and was re-released as part of the &quot;Rare Replay&quot; video game compilation. In 2019, this version was enhanced to run at native 4K resolution on Xbox One X.

<text>George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. (February 14, 1859 – November 22, 1896) was an American civil engineer. He is mostly known for creating the original Ferris Wheel for the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition.

== Early life ==
Ferris was born on February 14, 1859, in Galesburg, Illinois, the town founded by his namesake, George Washington Gale. His parents were George Washington Gale Ferris Sr. and Martha Edgerton Hyde. He had an older brother named Frederick Hyde, born in 1843. In 1864 when Ferris was five years old, his family sold their dairy farm and moved to Nevada. For two years, they lived in Carson Valley.

From 1868 to 1890, his father, George Washington Gale Ferris Sr., owned the Sears–Ferris House at 311 W. Third, Carson City, Nevada. Originally built in about 1863 by Gregory A. Sears, a pioneer Carson City businessman, the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places for Carson City on February 9, 1979. 
Ferris Senior was an agriculturalist/horticulturalist, noteworthy in Carson City&#x27;s development for much of the city&#x27;s landscaping during the 1870s, and for importing a large number of the trees from the east that were planted throughout the city.

Ferris left Nevada in 1875 to attend the California Military Academy in Oakland, where he graduated in 1876. He graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, in the class of 1881 with a degree in Civil Engineering. At RPI he was a charter member of the local chapter of the Chi Phi Fraternity and a member of the Rensselaer Society of Engineers. He was made a member of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Alumni Hall of Fame in 1998.

Ferris began his career in the railroad industry and was interested in bridge building. He founded a company, G.W.G. Ferris &amp; Co. in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to test and inspect metals for railroads and bridge builders.

Ferris House, his home at 1318 Arch Street, Central Northside, was added to the list of City of Pittsburgh Designated Historic Structures on June 28, 2001.

==Ferris wheel==

News of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition to be held in 1893, in Chicago, Illinois, drew Ferris to the city. In 1891, the Exposition&#x27;s directors issued a challenge to American engineers to conceive of a monument for the fair to surpass the Eiffel Tower, the great structure of the Paris International Exposition of 1889. The planners wanted something &quot;original, daring and unique&quot;. Ferris proposed a wheel from which visitors could view the entire exhibition, a wheel that would &quot;out-Eiffel Eiffel&quot;.

Ferris returned in a few weeks with several respectable endorsements from established engineers, and the committee agreed to allow construction to begin. Most convincingly, he had recruited several local investors to cover the $400,000 cost of construction.

The Ferris Wheel had 36 cars, each fitted with 40 revolving chairs and able to accommodate up to 60 people, giving a total capacity of 2,160. When the fair opened, it carried some 38,000 passengers daily, taking 20 minutes to complete two revolutions—the first involving six stops to allow passengers to enter and exit, and the second a nine-minute non-stop rotation, for which the ticket holder paid 50 cents. It carried 2.5 million passengers before it was finally demolished in 1906.

After the fair closed, Ferris claimed that the exhibition management had robbed him and his investors of their portion of the nearly $750,000 profit that his wheel brought in. He spent the next two years in litigation.

==Death==
Ferris Sr. died in 1895, followed soon after by Ferris Jr. himself, on November 22, 1896, at Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, of typhoid fever. His ashes remained at a Pittsburgh crematorium for over a year, waiting for someone to take possession of them.

<doc id="307342" wikidata="Q5124669" url="?curid=307342" title="Civil liberties in the United States">
<text>Civil liberties in the United States are certain unalienable rights retained by (as opposed to privileges granted to) those in the United States, under the Constitution of the United States, as interpreted and clarified by the Supreme Court of the United States and lower federal courts. Civil liberties are simply defined as individual legal and constitutional protections from entities more powerful than an individual, for example, parts of the government, other individuals, or corporations. The explicitly defined liberties make up the Bill of Rights, including freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, and the right to privacy. There are also many liberties of people not defined in the Constitution, as stated in the Ninth Amendment: &quot;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&quot;

The extent of civil liberties and the percentage of the population of the United States who had access to these liberties has expanded over time. For example, the Constitution did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to determine who was eligible. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only white male adult property owners to vote (about 6% of the population). The &#x27;Three-Fifths Compromise&#x27; allowed the southern slaveholders to consolidate power and maintain slavery in America for eighty years after the ratification of the Constitution. And the Bill of Rights had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 130 years after ratification.

==United States Constitution==
===Freedom of religion===

The text of Amendment I to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:

===Freedom of expression===
====Free Speech Clause====
The text of Amendment I to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:

====Free Press Clause====

The text of Amendment I to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:

====Free Assembly Clause====

The text of Amendment I to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:

====Petition Clause====
The text of Amendment I to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:

====Free speech exceptions====

The following types of speech are not protected constitutionally: defamation or false statements, child pornography, obscenity, damaging the national security interests, verbal acts, and fighting words. Because these categories fall outside of the First Amendment privileges, the courts can legally restrict or criminalize any expressive act within them. Other expressions, including threat of bodily harm or publicizing illegal activity, may also be ruled illegal.

===Right to keep and bear arms===

The text of Amendment II to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:

===Sexual freedom===
The concept of sexual freedom includes a broad range of different rights that are not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. The idea of sexual freedom has sprung more from the popular opinion of society in more recent years, and has had very little Constitutional backing. The following liberties are included under sexual freedom: sexual expression, sexual choices, sexual education, reproductive justice, and sexual health. Sexual freedom in general is considered an implied procedure, and is not mentioned in the Constitution.

Sexual freedoms include the freedom to have consensual sex with whomever a person chooses, at any time, for any reason, provided the person is of the age of majority. Marriage is not required, nor are there any requirements as to the gender or number of people you have sex with. Sexual freedom includes the freedom to have private consensual homosexual sex (&quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;).

===Equal protection===
Equal protection prevents the government from creating laws that are discriminatory in application or effect.

===Right to vote===

The text of Amendment XIV to the United States Constitution, ratified July 9, 1868, states that:

The text of Amendment XV to the United States Constitution, ratified February 3, 1870, states that:

The text of Amendment XIX to the United States Constitution, ratified August 18, 1919, states that:

The text of Amendment XXIV to the United States Constitution, ratified January 23, 1964, states that:

The text of Amendment XXVI to the United States Constitution, ratified July 1, 1971, states that:

===Right to parent one&#x27;s children===
The right to parent one&#x27;s own children also includes the right for a parent to teach their children as they see fit, and not have others govern over what their children are taught.

===Right to privacy===
===Right to marriage===

The 1967 United States Supreme Court ruling in the case &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; found a fundamental right to marriage, regardless of race. The 2015 United States Supreme Court ruling in the case &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; found a fundamental right to marriage, regardless of gender.

===Rights of self-defense===
The right to self-defense is rooted in common law and has been incorporated into statutory law in all 50 states. It serves as a legal justification for the use of force, including deadly force in some cases, when an individual reasonably believes they are in imminent danger of bodily harm or death.

The use of force in self-defense is generally considered justifiable for the protection of oneself. However, there are limitations on when and how this force can be applied. The law typically requires that the force used be proportional to the threat faced, and that the person claiming self-defense had a reasonable belief that they were in danger.

Historically, many jurisdictions required individuals to attempt to retreat from a dangerous situation before using force in self-defense. However, this requirement has been modified or eliminated in many states through the adoption of stand-your-ground laws.

Self-defense laws can also vary significantly from state to state. For example, only 13 states maintain a strict duty to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense. Additionally, some states limit the application of stand your ground laws to certain locations, such as one&#x27;s home or vehicle. The threshold for what constitutes a reasonable belief of imminent danger also differs between jurisdictions.

<text>A ferrule (a corruption of Latin &#x27; &quot;small bracelet&quot;, under the influence of&#x27; &quot;iron&quot;) is any of a number of types of objects, generally used for fastening, joining, sealing, or reinforcement. They are often narrow circular rings made from metal, or less commonly, plastic. Ferrules are also often referred to as eyelets or grommets within the manufacturing industry.

Most ferrules consist of a circular clamp used to hold together and attach fibers, wires, or posts, generally by crimping, swaging, or otherwise deforming the ferrule to permanently tighten it onto the parts that it holds.

==Examples==
*The sleeve, usually plastic or metal, on the end of a shoelace, preventing it from unraveling (called the aglet)
*The metal sleeve which is crimped to hold the eraser in place on a pencil
*The metal band that binds the bristles or hair of a brush to its handle
*The metal ring which holds a chisel blade&#x27;s tang to its handle
*In fiber optic terminations, glass or plastic fibers are bonded to precision ferrule connectors (FCs), also described as fiber channel connectors, and polished for splitting or connecting two fibers together.
*The metal spike at the end of the shaft of an ice axe
*The margin of a cast crown that stabilizes root-canal-treated teeth in restorative dentistry
*A ferrule, in respect to dentistry, is a band that encircles the external dimension of residual tooth structure, not unlike the metal bands that exist around a barrel. This is also known as the ferrule effect. 
*The bottom end of a flag stick on a golf course, which fits snugly into the hole in a cup
*The plastic sleeve that adorns the bottom of a steel or graphite golf club shaft just above the club head hosel. Originally designed to protect the shaft from damaging vibrations, it is now used mainly for aesthetic purposes.
*The metal band used to prevent the end of a wooden instrument or tool from splitting
*The semi-circular metal band that holds in place the fibers on the frog of a bow for an instrument in the violin family
*Compression fittings for attaching tubing (piping) commonly have ferrules (sometimes called &quot;olives&quot;, especially in the UK) in them to make a liquid-tight connection
*A swaged termination type for wire rope
*The cap at the end of a cane or umbrella as well as the ring, often crimped, sometimes pinned, that prevents an umbrella&#x27;s canopy from sliding off the end when open
*The portion of a cue in pool, billiards and snooker that tops the and to which the is bonded; historically made of ivory, now typically made of fiberglass, phenolic resin, brass or titanium.
*A joint between sections of a segmented fishing rod 
*A metal cap at the end of a cable housing with a hole on a bicycle or motorcycle control cable
*The metal sleeve that connects a hypodermic needle to a plastic Luer taper (which then connects to a syringe or intravenous therapy tubing)
*An electric wire ferrule is a metal tube crimped over stranded wire to secure it within a screw terminal, optionally with electrical insulation protecting any exposed portion of the wire not completely inside the screw terminal post.
*A rubber or plastic cap at the bottom end of a walking stick.
*The metal tip on a staff carrying a flag or guidon that finishes and protects the end of the wooden shaft.

==Reasons for use==
Some of the reasons people use ferrules include:
* To &quot;shield&quot; parts or cables from electromagnetic pulses, environmental damage, the elements, thermal factors, and more.
* To &quot;cover&quot; parts, adding wear resistance, damage protection, or packaging. 
* As a &quot;connector&quot;, to connect wires, structural devices, and systems
* To &quot;bind&quot; parts together, including bundles of wires, or cloth threads to the end of the mop, as an example.
* To act as &quot;&quot; for fluids like oil and water, or for gasses like air.

<doc id="307349" wikidata="Q713552" url="?curid=307349" title="Frank Olson">
<text>Frank Rudolph Emmanuel Olson (July 17, 1910 – November 28, 1953) was an American bacteriologist, biological warfare scientist, and an employee of the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories (USBWL) who worked at Camp Detrick (now Fort Detrick) in Maryland. At a meeting in rural Maryland, he was covertly dosed with LSD by his colleague 
Sidney Gottlieb (head of the CIA&#x27;s MKUltra program) and, nine days later, plunged to his death from the window of the Hotel Statler in New York. The U.S. government first described his death as a suicide, and then as misadventure, while others allege murder. The Rockefeller Commission report on the CIA in 1975 acknowledged their having conducted covert drug studies on fellow agents. Olson&#x27;s death is one of the most mysterious outcomes of the CIA mind control project MKUltra.

==Biography==
===Youth and education===
Olson was born to Swedish immigrant parents in Hurley, Iron County, Wisconsin. Olson graduated from Hurley High School in 1927. Olson enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, earning both a B.S. and, in 1938, a Ph.D. in bacteriology. He married his classmate, Alice, and would go on to have three children. Olson enrolled in the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps to help pay off his college costs, and was called to active duty at Fort Hood in Texas as the United States entered World War II. Olson worked for a short time at Purdue University&#x27;s Agricultural Experimentation Station before being called to active duty.

===Work with the Army &amp; CIA===
Olson served as a captain in the U.S. Army Chemical Corps. In December 1942, he got a call from Ira Baldwin, his thesis adviser at UW and the future mentor of Sidney Gottlieb, who would go on to be the CIA&#x27;s leading chemist and director of MK-ULTRA. Ira had been called to leave his University post to direct a secret program regarding the development of biological weapons, and wanted Olson to join him as one of the first scientists at what would become Fort Detrick. The army transferred him to Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. A few months later, the Chemical Corps took over Detrick and established its secret Biologicals Warfare Laboratories.

At Camp Detrick, Baldwin worked with industrial partners such as George W. Merck and the U.S. military to establish the top secret U.S. bioweapons program beginning in 1943, during World War II, a time when interest in applying modern technology to warfare was high. Olson also worked with ex-Nazis who had been brought into the country through Operation Paperclip on the utilization of aerosolized anthrax.

Olson was discharged from the Army in 1944 and remained at Detrick on a civilian contract, continuing his research into aerobiology. In 1949, he joined many other Detrick scientists in Antigua for Operation Harness, which tested the vulnerability of different animals to toxic clouds. In 1950, he was a part of Operation Sea-Spray, where the bacterium Serratia marcescens was released into the coastal mists of San Francisco through a minesweeper, reaching all of San Francisco&#x27;s 800,000 residents, as well as people living in eight surrounding cities. Olson traveled often to Fort Terry, a secret army base off Long Island, where toxins too deadly to be brought onto the U.S. mainland were tested.

This was the period where senior military officials and CIA officers were becoming deeply troubled at Soviet progress, and feared they were heading towards mastery of microbe warfare. Their alarm led to the forming of the Special Operations Division at Detrick in spring of 1949, with the purpose of conducting research on &quot;covert&quot; ways to utilize chemical weapons. SOD was known as a &quot;Detrick within a Detrick&quot; due to its level of secrecy. Olson became acting chief of SOD within a year of its creation, originally invited to join by colleague and SOD&#x27;s first chief, John Schwab.

At some point while assigned as a civilian U.S. Army contractor, Olson began working as a CIA employee. In May 1952, Frank Olson was appointed to the committee for Project Artichoke, an experimental CIA interrogation program.

===Disaffection===

By the time Olson stepped down as chief of SOD in early 1953, citing &quot;pressures of the job&quot; that aggravated his ulcers, he had officially joined the CIA after working closely with them for years. He did stay with SOD, which functioned as a CIA research station hidden within a military base. Olson did a lot of work at Detrick that his children said had a lasting effect on his psyche. Olson witnessed and assisted in the poisoning, gassing, and torture of laboratory animals at Detrick, which his son Eric recalled having a deep effect on Olson: &quot;He&#x27;d come to work in the morning and see piles of dead monkeys. That messes with you. He wasn&#x27;t the right guy for that.&quot; Olson also witnessed multiple torture sessions in international CIA safe-houses, where people were &quot;literally interrogated to death in experimental methods combining drugs, hypnosis, and torture to attempt to master brainwashing techniques and memory erasing.&quot;

On February 23, 1953, the Chinese broadcast charges that two captured American pilots had claimed the U.S. was conducting germ warfare against North Korea. 
Other captured Americans such as Colonel Walker &quot;Bud&quot; Mahurin made similar statements. The United States government threatened to charge some POWs with treason for cooperating with their captors. After their release, the prisoners of war would publicly repudiate their confessions as having been extracted by torture. On 27 July 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, launching Operation Big Switch, the repatriation of Korean War POWs. Twenty-one American POWs refused repatriation and defected, and the returning POWs were viewed as potential security risks. As a result, debriefings became &quot;hostile investigations in search of possible disloyalty&quot;. The day the armistice was signed, Olson, a bacteriologist, arrived in Northolt, UK. Olson&#x27;s home movies from the trip indicate he traveled to London, Paris, Stockholm, and Berlin. Upon his return, Olson&#x27;s mood was noticeably changed, according to his family. According to coworker Norman Cournoyer, Olson had witnessed interrogations in Europe and become convinced that the United States had used biological weapons during the Korean War. Journalist Gordon Thomas claims that Olson subsequently visited William Sargant, a British psychiatrist with high level security clearances. According to Thomas, Sargant reported that Olson had become a security threat and his access to military facilities should be limited.

Olson had spent a decade at Detrick and knew all the secrets of the Special Operations Division. He frequently traveled to Germany to witness interrogation sessions in multiple secret prisons (evidence places Olson in Frankfurt, Berlin, and Heidelberg), where the victims would occasionally die from trauma of the tactics used. Olson was one of the several SOD scientists who traveled to, or through, France in the summer of &#x27;51 when the French village of Pont-Saint-Esprit was poisoned by naturally occurring ergot, the fungus from which LSD was derived.

===Drugging of Olson===
A semi-monthly retreat of the men closest to MK-ULTRA was scheduled at a cabin at Deep Creek Lake for Wednesday, November 18, to Friday, November 20, 1953. A tentative participants list included twelve names:

; Fort Detrick participants
* Olson, a scientist with the Special Operations Division of the United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories at Fort Detrick, who was suspected of being a security risk.
* Lt. Col. Vincent Ruwet, Olson&#x27;s supervisor, the head of the Special Operations Division.
* John L. Schwab, who had founded the division and in 1953 served as its lab chief
* John Stubbs, one of the Fort Detrick personnel
* Benjamin Wilson, a member of the Special Operations Division.
* Herbert &quot;Bert&quot; Tanner, one of the Fort Detrick personnel
* John C. Malinowski, a Detrick staffer who didn&#x27;t drink alcohol and thus was not dosed.
* Gerald Yonetz, a Special Operations Division scientist

; CIA participants 
* Sidney Gottlieb, a CIA chemist responsible for Project MKUltra.
* Robert Lashbrook, Gottlieb&#x27;s deputy, who dosed the liquor everyone was drinking along with Gottlieb.
* A. Hughes, suspected to be CIA
* Henry Bortner, of the CIA

=== Aftermath of drugging ===
On Thursday evening, November 19, around 7:30, Olson and some of the other participants were drugged with a &quot;potential truth serum&quot;, decades later discovered to be LSD. The next morning, Olson headed back to Maryland a changed man. Having dinner with his family, Olson refused to eat, and seemed distant from his family, not speaking about his trip or attending to his children. He blurted out to his wife, &quot;I&#x27;ve made a terrible mistake.&quot; MK-ULTRA had been underway for seven months at this time, and barely two dozen men knew the true nature and intentions of the project.

On November 23, Olson and his boss, Lt. Col. Vincent Ruwet, arrived to work at Detrick, both still in bad shape from the retreat. Ruwet later recalled that Olson appeared to be agitated, and asked if Ruwet should fire him or if he should quit. While Ruwet was able to calm him down for the day, Olson only worsened by the next day. Ruwet later testified Olson was &quot;disoriented,&quot; felt &quot;all mixed up&quot; about the work he had been doing, and felt &quot;all mixed up&quot; and &quot;incompetent&quot; in his field.

===Attempted resignation===
On Tuesday, November 24, Olson went to work as usual, but unexpectedly returned home before noon, accompanied by a coworker, John Stubbs. Olson explained Stubbs&#x27;s presence, saying &quot;They&#x27;re afraid I might hurt you.&quot; Olson informed his wife that he had agreed to undergo psychiatric treatment.

That same day, Olson, Ruwet, and CIA chemist Robert Lashbrook flew to New York City. In New York, Olson and Lashbrook met with Harold Abramson, a CIA-linked medical doctor, who had worked with Olson years earlier on studies of aerosolization.

===Death===

Around 2 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, November 28, 1953, Olson plummeted onto the sidewalk in front of the Statler Hilton Hotel (formerly the Hotel Pennsylvania). The night manager rushed to Olson, who was still alive and who &quot;tried to mumble something&quot;. Olson died before medical help arrived. Years later, the night manager recalled &quot;In all my years in the hotel business, I never encountered a case where someone got up in the middle of the night, ran across a dark room in his underwear, avoiding two beds, and dove through a closed window with the shade and curtains drawn.&quot;

When police entered the hotel room, they found Robert Lashbrook sitting on the toilet in the room he shared with Olson.

The hotel’s switchboard operator reported having connected a call from room 1018A to a number listed as belonging to Dr. Harold Abramson. According to the operator, who overheard the entirety of the brief call, the occupant in 1018A reported &quot;Well, he&#x27;s gone.&quot; to which the call&#x27;s recipient had replied &quot;Well, that’s too bad.&quot;

Lashbrook&#x27;s wallet contained the initials, address, and phone number of magician-turned-CIA asset John Mullholland. Lashbrook claimed he and Olson had visited Mulholland, although this is disputed by author H.P. Albarelli.

At the scene, and in their written report, the two police officers discussed similarities to the 1948 Laurence Duggan case, in which a high-level government official suspected of espionage died after plummeting from his New York office. The ensuing police report said that on his last night in Manhattan, Olson purposely threw himself out of the window of his tenth-floor hotel room at the Hotel Statler, which he had been sharing with Lashbrook, and died shortly after impact.

==Murder and wrongful death allegations==

===1975===
Although Olson&#x27;s family told friends that he &quot;fell or jumped&quot; and had suffered &quot;a fatal nervous breakdown&quot; which resulted in the fall, the family had no real knowledge of the specific details surrounding the tragedy, until the Rockefeller Commission uncovered some of the CIA&#x27;s MKULTRA activities in 1975. That year, the government admitted that Olson had been dosed with LSD, without his knowledge, nine days before his death. After the family announced they planned to sue the Agency over Olson&#x27;s &quot;wrongful death,&quot; the government offered them an out-of-court settlement of $1,250,000, later reduced to $750,000 (about $3.8 million in 2021 value ), which they accepted. The family received apologies from President Gerald Ford and CIA director William Colby.

===1994–1996===
In 1994, Eric Olson had his father&#x27;s body exhumed to be buried with his mother. The family decided to have a second autopsy performed. The 1953 medical report completed immediately after Dr. Olson&#x27;s death indicated that there were cuts and abrasions on the body. Theories that sparked about Olson having been assassinated by the CIA led to the second autopsy, which was performed by James Starrs, Professor of Law and Forensic Science at the George Washington University National Law Center. His team searched the body for any cuts and abrasions and found none, though did find a large hematoma on the left side of Olson&#x27;s head and a large injury on his chest. Most of the team concluded that the blunt-force trauma to the head and the injury to the chest had not occurred during the fall, but most likely before the fall (one team member dissented). Starrs called the evidence &quot;rankly and starkly suggestive of homicide.&quot;

Also in 1994, Eric Olson testified before the U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; &quot;Legislation and National Security Subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations&quot; hearings on the US Government&#x27;s &quot;Cold War Era Human Subject Experiments&quot;. He spoke about how the sudden and mysterious death of his father deeply affected his family and appealed to the Congress to help with their ongoing battle to get the CIA to release more details of his father&#x27;s final days.

In 1996, Eric Olson approached the U.S. District Attorney in Manhattan, Robert Morgenthau, to see if his office would open a new investigation. Stephen Saracco and Daniel Bibb of the office&#x27;s &quot;cold case&quot; unit collected preliminary information, including a deposition of Lashbrook, but concluded that there was no compelling case to send to a grand jury. In 2001, Canadian historian Michael Ignatieff wrote for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; an account of Eric&#x27;s decades-long campaign to clear his father&#x27;s name. Eric Olson asserts that the forensic evidence of death is suggestive of a method used by the CIA found in the first manual of assassination that says &quot;The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface.&quot;

===2012–2013===
On November 28, 2012, sons Eric and Nils Olson filed suit in the US District Court in Washington, D.C., seeking unspecified compensatory damages as well as access to documents related to their father&#x27;s death and other matters that they claimed the CIA had withheld from them. The case was dismissed in July 2013, due in part to the 1976 settlement between the family and government. In the decision dismissing the suit, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg wrote, &quot;While the court must limit its analysis to the four corners of the complaint, the skeptical reader may wish to know that the public record supports many of the allegations [in the family&#x27;s suit], farfetched as they may sound.&quot;

=== 2017–2018 ===
Netflix released a documentary miniseries, entitled &quot;Wormwood&quot; (2017), based on the mystery of Olson&#x27;s death; it was directed by Errol Morris. In the miniseries, journalist Seymour Hersh says the government had a security process to identify and execute domestic dissidents (perceived to pose a risk). He said that Frank Olson was a victim of this and an ongoing cover-up after his death. However, Hersh explained that he cannot elaborate or publish on the facts because it would compromise his source.

Writing for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, scholar Michael Ignatieff concludes &quot;Though I still resist the facts, the facts, as [Eric] Olson’s research has established, are that Allen Dulles, Richard Helms, and other unnamed persons at the highest levels of the American government ordered the death of Eric’s father [Frank Olson] because they feared he knew too much about US biological warfare during the Korean War and about the torture and execution of Soviet agents and ex-Nazi &quot;expendables&quot; in black sites in Europe during the early 1950s. Having killed him, the CIA confected the story that Olson&#x27;s death was a suicide brought on by stress, and later attributed his jump from the window to the effects of a cocktail laced with LSD. It now appears that the LSD was administered, at a CIA retreat in Maryland, to discover exactly what Olson knew. When this experiment revealed that he was indeed &quot;unreliable,&quot; he was taken to New York and disposed of.&quot; Academic Milton Leitenberg strongly disputed Ignatieff&#x27;s conclusions, arguing that &quot;there was no biological warfare carried out by any agency of the US government during the Korean War, or for that matter by anyone else.&quot;

<text>A stun belt is a belt fastened around the subject&#x27;s waist, leg, or arm that carries a battery and control pack, and contains features to stop the subject from unfastening or removing it. A remote-control signal is sent to tell the control pack to give the subject an electric shock. Some models are activated by the subject&#x27;s movement.

The electrical pulse delivered by the control pack is based on the waveform developed by Jack Cover, which he called the TASER.

These devices are used to control prisoners in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Some stun belts can restrain the subject&#x27;s hands and have a strap going under his groin to stop him from rotating the belt around his waist to reach its battery and control pack and trying to deactivate it. Stun belts are not generally available to the public.

In 1996, Amnesty International called on the United States to ban the use and export of the machine, arguing that it is a torture device that is &quot;in direct contravention of international standards on the treatment of prisoners&quot;. Since then, the United States has not complied with the organization&#x27;s request. Presently, the U.S. and South Africa are the only two countries that still use the stun belt.

<doc id="307351" wikidata="Q1323276" url="?curid=307351" title="Mohammad Baqir al-Hakim">
<text>Ayatollah al-[[Sayyid]] Muhammad Baqir Muhsin al-Hakim at-Tabataba&#x27;i (8 July 1939 – 29 August 2003; ), also known as Shaheed al-Mehraab, was a senior Iraqi Shia Islamic Scholar and the leader of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI). Al-Hakim spent more than 20 years in exile in Iran and returned to Iraq on 12 May 2003 following the US-led invasion. Al-Hakim was a contemporary of Ayatollah Khomeini, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; compared the two in terms of their times in exile and their support in their respective homelands. After his return to Iraq, al-Hakim&#x27;s life was in danger because of his work to encourage Shiite resistance to Saddam Hussein and from a rivalry with Muqtada al-Sadr, the son of the late Ayatollah Mohammed Sadeq al-Sadr, who had himself been assassinated in Najaf in 1999. Al-Hakim was assassinated in a massive car-bomb explosion in his hometown Najaf in 2003 when he emerged from the shrine of Imam Ali. He was 63. At least 75 others were also killed in the bombing.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Al-Hakim was born in Najaf in 1939 into the Hakim Family of Shi&#x27;ite religious scholars. He was the son of Muhsin al-Hakim and Fawzieh Hassan Bazzi. Al-Hakim was the uncle of Muhammad Sayid al-Hakim. Al-Hakim&#x27;s father was a senior cleric in Najaf. He learned a traditional Shiite imam&#x27;s training. He was arrested and tortured for his beliefs by the Ba&#x27;athist government in 1972 and fled to Iran in 1980. Many relatives of Al-Hakim were killed by the Baathist government.

===Political activities in Iraq===

Al-Hakim was head of the Supreme Council of the Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), a highly influential group within Iraq&#x27;s Shia community and high ranking U.S. officials had met with the brother of Mohammad Baqir al-Hakim, intent on securing a new ally against Saddam Hussein. He co-founded the modern Islamic political movement in Iraq in the 1960s, along with Mohammad Baqir al-Sadr, with whom he worked closely until the latter&#x27;s death in 1980. In an event, Mohammad Baqir Al-Sadr sent Al-Hakim to calm the people who were trapped by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government troops between Karbala and Najaf. This incident prompted the Baathist government to arrest Baqir Al-Hakim, he was subsequently imprisoned and tortured. When Mohammad Baqir Al-Sadr was on house arrest remained in communication with Baqir Al-Hakim. 

Though not among the most hard-line of Islamists, Al-Hakim was seen as dangerous by the ruling Ba&#x27;ath regime, largely because of his agitation on behalf of Iraq&#x27;s majority Shia population (the ruling regime was mostly Sunnis).

However, his sentence was commuted and he was released in July 1979. The subsequent eruption of war between Iraq and largely Shia Iran led to an ever-increasing distrust of Iraq&#x27;s Shia population by the ruling Ba&#x27;ath party; combined with his previous arrests, Al-Hakim defected to Iran in 1980.

===SCIRI and Iran===

Safely in Iran under the protection of the Iranian government, Al-Hakim became an open enemy of the Ba&#x27;athists, forming the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), a revolutionary group dedicated to overthrowing Saddam Hussein and installing clerical rule.With Iranian military aid, SCIRI became an armed resistance group, periodically making cross-border attacks against Baathist and maintaining covert connections with resistance elements within the country.

===Badr Brigades===

The Badr Brigades were the military wing of SCIRI until 2003. Al-Hakim created the Badr Brigades which fought against Saddam Hussein. The Badr Brigades contained to number about 10,000 equipped and trained soldiers. On 11 February 1995, Badr corps attacked Iraqi government forces in Amarah. During the War in Iraq (2013–17), Badr Brigades fought against ISIL under the Popular Mobilization Forces.

==Return to Iraq==

Al-Hakim returned to Iraq on 12 May 2003 following the overthrow of Saddam&#x27;s regime by the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq after spending more than two decades of exile in neighboring Iran. There he emerged as one of the most influential Iraqi leaders, with his longtime opposition to Saddam gaining him immense credibility, especially among the majority Shia population.

Initially, he was very critical of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, but Al-Hakim gave the US credit for overthrowing Saddam&#x27;s government first, so that SCIRI and other Shia opposition parties found time to re-establish themselves between Shia people. Al-Hakim&#x27;s brother, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, was appointed to the Iraq interim governing council and the two worked closely together. By the time of his death, he remained distrustful, but publicly urged Iraqis to abandon violence, at least for the time being, and give the interim government a chance to earn their trust. Although Al-Hakim publicly urged the abandonment of violence, his Badr Brigade was described by &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;one of the main groups accused of carrying out sectarian killings&quot;.

==Assassination==

Al-Hakim was killed on 29 August 2003, when a car bomb exploded as he left the Shrine of Imam Ali in Najaf. The blast killed at least 84 others; some estimate that as many as 125 died in the bombing. Fifteen bodyguards of al-Hakim were among the people killed in the blast.

===Perpetrators===

On 30 August 2003, Iraqi authorities arrested four people in connection with the bombing: two former members of the Ba&#x27;ath Party from Basra, and two non-Iraqi Arabs from the Salafi sect.

According to U.S. and Iraqi officials, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was responsible for Hakim&#x27;s assassination. They claim that Abu Omar al-Kurdi, a top Zarqawi bombmaker who was captured in January 2005, confessed to carrying out this bombing. They also cite Zarqawi&#x27;s praising of the assassination in several audiotapes. Muhammad Yassin Jarrad, the brother-in-law of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed that his father, Yassin, was the suicide bomber in the attack.

Oras Mohammed Abdulaziz, an alleged Al-Qaeda militant, was hanged in Baghdad in July 2007 after being sentenced to death in October 2006 for his role in the assassination of al-Hakim.

==Funeral==

Hundreds of thousands of people attended his funeral in Najaf and showed their hatred of the US military occupation on 2 September 2003. They protested the US forces and demanded their withdrawal from Iraq.

His grave was petrol-bombed by anti-government protesters during the 2019 Iraqi protests.

<text>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Commission, 447 U.S. 530 (1980), was a United States Supreme Court decision addressing the free speech rights of public utility corporations under the First Amendment. In a majority opinion written by Justice Lewis Powell, the Court invalidated an order by the New York Public Service Commission that prohibited utility companies from including inserts on controversial matters of public policy with billing statements.
