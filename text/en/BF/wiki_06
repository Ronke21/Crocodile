<text>Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro () is a historical province of Portugal located in the northeastern corner of the country, known for its scenery, which includes plateaux, river valleys, mountains, and castles.

==History==
A first attempt to register its constitution was made under the reign of King Sancho II (1223–1248). A second was made in the reign of his son and successor, Afonso III (1248–1279), under the Inquirições or royal commissions in 1258, intending to base the territory of Trás-os-Montes on so-called &quot;new towns&quot; under direct control of the Crown. Afonso III gave it its charter in 1253, referring to the town, &quot;a hill opposite the Crespos&quot;, which already had a core of settlements organized around the Church of St. Facundo.

Since 1833 the region has been divided into two districts on the right (northern) bank of the Douro river — Vila Real and Bragança, with 5 other municipalities on the south bank of the Douro river included in the districts of Viseu and Guarda. The name — Beyond-the-Mountains and Upper Douro — refers to the location on the &quot;other&quot; (eastern) side of such mountains as Marão, Alvão and Gerês, which separate the coast from the interior, and along the upper valley of the Douro River. This isolation kept the province poor and underpopulated for centuries, causing many people to move to the coast or emigrate to other European countries such as France, Luxembourg and Switzerland, and to Brazil.

The most important towns in the region are Vila Real, Bragança, Chaves, Mirandela, Macedo de Cavaleiros, Lamego, Peso da Régua, Mogadouro, Miranda do Douro and Valpaços. All are relatively small, with less than 50 000 inhabitants. Many people in the region still live in small villages. Traditionally these villages were cut off from the coast due to the lack of good roads, and suffered the effects of poverty and isolation. Emigration was often the only option. Today the situation has improved with better roads, but most villages are still losing population as youngsters there move to bigger towns for a better life.

In small villages the ageing inhabitants still eke out a living from small farms. Corn, rye, potatoes, wheat, olive oil, chestnuts, and grapes for wine (namely Port wine) have been the main agricultural products. Granite and mineral water are also important industries.

There is a popular saying: &quot;Beyond Marão, those who rule are those who&#x27;re there&quot; (&quot;Para lá do Marão mandam os que lá estão&quot;). Lisbon has paid little attention to this area until recent years. According to Padre Fontes, a local ethnographer, &quot;in this centuries-old &quot;corner of the corner of Europe&quot;, alone, in a struggle against the harsh soil and inclement climate, a character was formed: &quot;that of the sad demeanor, the mistrusting air, courageous, daring, hardworking, loyal, and with strength of character a way of life.&quot; &quot;Etnografia Transmontana, Lisbon, 1992&quot;

The Transmontanos are known in Portugal for their often plentiful table, usually filled with wine, olive oil, sausage and bread.

==Municipalities==
The historical province of &quot;Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro&quot; included 31 municipalities, divided between four districts (Vila Real, Bragança, Viseu and Guarda), that include:
;Vila Real (14 municipalities):

* Alijó
* Boticas
* Chaves
* Mesão Frio
* Mondim de Basto
* Montalegre
* Murça
* Peso da Régua
* Ribeira de Pena
* Sabrosa
* Santa Marta de Penaguião
* Valpaços
* Vila Pouca de Aguiar
* Vila Real

;Bragança (12 municipalities)

* Alfândega da Fé
* Bragança
* Carrazeda de Ansiães
* Freixo de Espada-à-Cinta
* Macedo de Cavaleiros
* Miranda do Douro
* Mirandela
* Mogadouro
* Torre de Moncorvo
* Vila Flor
* Vimioso
* Vinhais

;Viseu (4 of 24 municipalities)

* Armamar
* Lamego
* São João da Pesqueira
* Tabuaço

;Guarda (1 of 14 municipalities)
* Vila Nova de Foz Côa
In 1998 there was a referendum on the creation of new Administrative Regions. The proposed region of Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro included these 31 municipalities, plus Mêda, also from the District of Guarda. The referendum had low participation (less than the required 50% to be mandatory), but the No won and the Administrative Regions were not created.

==Culture==

Due to the region&#x27;s isolation from outside influence, many folkloric forms have remained preserved up to the modern day. One example would be the area&#x27;s distinctive traditional bagpipe, the &quot;gaita transmontana&quot;. Not only did Trás-os-Montes maintain a piping tradition as bagpipes in general declined throughout Europe, but the regional bagpipe also shows many aspects of pre-modern musical scales which have been preserved.
Also, it&#x27;s in this region that is spoken the second official language of Portugal, the Mirandese language.

<text>The Seoul Metropolitan Subway () is a metropolitan railway system consisting of 23 rapid transit, light metro, commuter rail and people mover lines located in northwest South Korea. The system serves most of the Seoul Metropolitan Area including the Incheon metropolis and satellite cities in Gyeonggi province. Some regional lines in the network stretch out beyond the Seoul Metropolitan Area to rural areas in northern Chungnam province and western Gangwon Province, that lie over away from the capital.

The network consists of multiple systems that form a larger, coherent system. These being the Seoul Metro proper, consisting of Seoul Metro lines 1 through 9 and certain light rail lines, that serves Seoul city proper and its surroundings; Korail regional rail lines, which serve the greater metropolitan region and beyond; Incheon Metro lines, operated by Incheon Transit Corporation, that serve Incheon city proper; and miscellaneous light rail lines, such as Gimpo Goldline and Yongin Everline, that connect lower-density areas of their respective cities to the rest of the network. Most of the system is operated by three companies – Seoul Metro, Korail (Korea Railroad Corporation), and Incheon Metro – with the rest being operated by an assortment of local municipal corporations and private rail companies.

Its first metro line, Line 1, started construction in 1971 and began operations in 1974, with through-operation to Korail&#x27;s suburban railways. As of 2022, the network has of track on lines 1–9 alone.

Most of the trains were built by Hyundai Rotem, South Korea&#x27;s leading train manufacturer.

==Overview==
The first line of the Seoul Subway network started construction in 1971. The first section of subway was built using the cheaper cut and cover construction method. Initial lines relied heavily on Japanese technology, and subsequent lines (until the early-2000s) procured technological imports from Japan and the United Kingdom (in particular, GEC Traction equipment used on wide-width Lines 2, 3 and 4 rolling stock from the 1980s). For example, Line 1 opened in 1974 with through services joining surrounding Korail suburban railway lines influenced by the Tokyo subway. Today, many of the Seoul Metropolitan Subway&#x27;s lines are operated by Korail, South Korea&#x27;s national rail operator.

The subway has free WiFi accessible in all stations and trains. All stations have platform screen doors. These safety doors were completed by 2017, however many stations previously had metal barriers installed decades beforehand. The world&#x27;s first virtual mart for smartphone users opened at Seolleung station in 2011.

All directional signs in the system are written in Korean using Hangul, as well as English and Katakana/Chinese characters for Japanese and Mandarin Chinese. However the maps on the walls are in Korean and English only. In the trains, there are in addition many LCD screens giving service announcements, upcoming stop names, YTN news, stock prices and animated shorts. There are also prerecorded voice announcements that give the upcoming station, any possible line transfer, and the exiting side in Korean, followed by English. At major stations, this is followed by Japanese, then Mandarin Chinese, as well.

Seoul Subway uses full-color LCD screens at all stations to display real-time subway arrival times, which are also available on apps for smartphones. Most trains have digital TV screens, and all of them have air conditioning and climate controlled seats installed that are automatically heated in the winter. In 2014, it became the world&#x27;s first metro operator to use transparent displays for ads when it installed 48 transparent displays on major stations of Line 2 in Gangnam District.
All lines use the T-money smart payment system using RFID and NFC technology for automatic payment by T-money smart cards, smartphones, or credit cards and one can transfer to any of the other line within the system for free.

Trains on numbered lines and light rail lines generally run on the right-hand track, while trains on the named heavy-rail lines (e.g. Shinbundang Line, Suin–Bundang Line, and AREX) run on the left-hand track. The exceptions are the trains on Line 1, as well as those on Line 4 south of Namtaeryeong station. These lines run on the left-hand track because these rail lines are government-owned via Korail or through-run to government-owned lines and follow a different standard to the metro, one that is followed by all national rail lines (with the exception of the otherwise self-contained Ilsan Line) because much of the Korean Peninsula&#x27;s early rail network was constructed during Japanese rule.

==History==
Line 1, from Seongbuk station to Incheon station and Suwon station, opened on 15 August 1974. On 9 December 1978, the Yongsan-Cheongnyangni line via Wangsimni (now part of the Jungang Line) was added to Line 1. Line 2 opened on 10 October 1980. Line 4 opened on 20 April 1985, and

On 23 March 2007, AREX opened. The Deokso-Paldang extension of the Jungang Line opened on 27 December. On 15 December 2008, the Cheonan-Sinchang extension of Line 1 opened. The magnetic paper ticket changed to an RFID-based card on 1 May 2009. On 1 July the Gyeongui Line from Seoul Station to Munsan station opened, and on 24 July Line 9 from Gaehwa station to Sinnonhyeon station opened.

The Byeongjeom-Seodongtan extension of Line 1 opened on 26 February 2010, and the Gyeongchun Line opened on 21 December. On 28 October 2011, the Shinbundang Line from Gangnam station to Jeongja station opened. The Suin Line, from Oido station to Songdo station, opened on 30 June 2012.

On 27 December 2014, the Gyeongui Line was extended to Yongsan and started through running to the Jungang Line, forming the Gyeongui–Jungang Line. The Sinnonhyeon-Sports Complex extension of Line 9 opened on 28 March 2015. On 30 January 2016 the Jeongja-Gwanggyo extension of the Shinbundang Line opened, followed by the Songdo-Incheon extension of the Suin Line on 27 February. Incheon Subway Line 2 opened on 30 July, and the Gyeonggang Line on 24 September.

Magongnaru station on Line 9 became an interchange station with AREX on 29 September 2018. Bundang line was extended northeastward to Cheongnyangni station, allowing for connections to the Gyeongchun Line and regional rail services on 31 December 2018. On 28 September 2019, the Gimpo Goldline opened. On 12 September 2020, the Suin Line extension between Hanyang Univ. at Ansan and Suwon, beginning the interlining with Line 4 between Oido and Hanyang Univ. at Ansan, as well as through-running with the Bundang Line to form the Suin–Bundang Line. On May 24, 2022, the Sillim Line opened, becoming the newest addition to the Seoul Metropolitan Subway.

==Lines and branches==
The system is organized such that numbered lines, with some exceptions, are considered as urban rapid transit lines located within the Seoul Metropolitan Area, whereas wide-area commuter lines operated by Korail provide a metro-like commuter rail service that usually extends far beyond the boundaries of the metropolitan area, rather similar to the RER in Paris. The AREX is an airport rail link that links Incheon International Airport and Gimpo Airport to central Seoul, and offers both express service directly to Incheon International Airport and all-stop commuter service for people living along the vicinity of the line. While operating hours may vary depending on the line and station in question, the Seoul Metropolitan Subway generally operates every day from 5.30 a.m. until midnight, with some lines operated by Seoul Metro ending services around 1 a.m. on weekdays.

==Rolling stock==
==Fares and ticketing==

The Seoul Metropolitan Subway system operates on a unified transportation fare system, meaning that subways and buses in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province are treated as one system when it comes to fares. For example, a subway rider can transfer to any other line for free (with the exception of Shinbundang Line, EverLine and U Line, the latter two adding a flat charge of 200 and 300 won respectively). One can also transfer to any Seoul, Incheon, Gyeonggi-do, or some South Chungcheong Province city buses for free and get discounted fares on the more expensive express buses.

In the case of Shinbundang Line, charges vary depending on the section used. The Sinsa - Gangnam section always charges 500 won, while the Gangnam - Jeongja section or the Jeongja - Gwanggyo section charges 1,000 won when used alone, and 1,400 altogether when used in conjunction with another. In total, the maximum added fee one can be charged is 1,900 won, which can be achieved by using all three sections.

From 1974 until 1985, the subway&#x27;s fare system was distance-based and Edmondson railway tickets, originally introduced for the Korean railways during Japanese rule, were used for fare validation. In 1985, the fare system changed to a zone-based system and magnetic-stripe paper tickets were introduced to replace the Edmondson system.

In 1996, the Seoul Metropolitan Subway became the first subway system in the world to roll out contactless smart cards, called Upass, for fare validation. These cards were issued up till October 2014, when they were discontinued in favour of the newer T-money cards.

Currently, the fare system is distance-based and accepted payment methods are single-use tickets, transportation cards including T-money and Cash Bee. Transportation cards can also be used on buses, taxis, convenience stores and many other popular retail places. Riders must tap in with a smartphone (KakaoPay and Samsung Pay/Wallet only), contactless-equipped credit or debit cards or other prepaid metro card at the entry gates. Popular methods of payments are using NFC-enabled Android smartphones (topped up or billed to the owner&#x27;s credit/debit card via the T-money app) or credit or check (debit) cards with built-in RFID technology issued by the bank or card company.

The current single-use ticket is a credit card-sized plastic card with RFID technology, which can be obtained from automated machines in every subway station. A 500 won deposit fee is included in the price, and is refunded when the ticket is returned at any station. Multiple use cards are sold in convenience stores and the functionality is included in many credit/debit cards.

Fares (except for single-use tickets) are currently 1,400 won for a trip up to 10 km (6.2 mi), with 100 won added for each subsequent 5 km (3.1 mi). Once 50 km (31.1 mi) has been passed, 100 won will be added every 8 km (5.0 mi). Single-use ticket users must pay RFID deposit 500 won plus 100 won surcharge to fare.

Half-priced children&#x27;s tickets are available. The city government also uses Seoul Citypass as a transportation card. Senior citizens and disabled people qualify for free transit and can get a free ticket with a valid ID card or enter with a registered transportation card without having the fare deducted.

International travelers can also use a Metropolitan Pass (MPASS) which provides up to 20 trips per day during the prepaid duration of 1 day to 7 days. Depending on where you purchase the card, the service is limited to the Seoul metropolitan area or Jeju Island and does not work in taxis or certain convenience stores.

<doc id="293932" wikidata="Q512934" url="?curid=293932" title="Shinran">
<text>was a Japanese Buddhist monk, who was born in Hino (now a part of Fushimi, Kyoto) at the turbulent close of the Heian Period and lived during the Kamakura Period. Shinran was a pupil of Hōnen and the founder of what ultimately became the sect of Japanese Buddhism.

==Names==
Shinran&#x27;s birthname was Matsuwakamaro. In accordance with Japanese customs, he has also gone by other names, including Hanen, Shakku and Zenshin, and then finally Shinran, which was derived by combining the names of Seshin (Vasubandhu in Japanese) and Donran (Tanluan’s name in Japanese). His posthumous title was Kenshin Daishi. For a while, Shinran also went by the name Fujii Yoshizane. After he was disrobed, he called himself Gutoku Shinran, in a self-deprecating manner which means &quot;stubble-haired foolish one,&quot; to denote his status as &quot;neither a monk, nor a layperson&quot;.

== Biography ==
According to traditional biographies, Shinran was born on May 21, 1173, to Lord and Lady Arinori, from a branch of the Fujiwara clan, and was given the name Matsuwakamaro. Early in Shinran&#x27;s life his parents both died. In 1181, desperate to know what happens after dying, he entered the Shōren-in temple near present-day Maruyama Park in Kyoto at age nine. Modern historians contest the identity and date of death of Shinran&#x27;s parents, suggesting he ordained alongside his father due to instability from the Genpei War. 

On entering the monkhood he wrote the following poem: &quot;Like the cherry blossom, the heart planning on tomorrow is ephemeral indeed—what sudden storm may not arise in the middle of the night&quot;. Acutely aware of his own impermanence, he was desperate to find a solution. He then practiced at Mt. Hiei for the next 20 years of his life. Letters between his wife and daughter indicate that he was a Tendai . 

According to his own account to his wife Eshinni (whose letters are preserved at the Hongan-ji), in frustration at his own failures as a monk and at obtaining enlightenment, he took a retreat at the temple of Rokkaku-dō. There, while engaged in intense practice, he experienced a vision in which Avalokitesvara appeared to him as Prince Shōtoku, directing Shinran to another disillusioned Tendai monk named Hōnen. 

In 1201, Shinran met Hōnen and became his disciple. During his first year under Hōnen&#x27;s guidance, at the age of 29, Shinran attained salvation through Amida&#x27;s Vow. Though the two only knew each other for a few years, Hōnen entrusted Shinran with a copy of his secret work, the Senchakushū. However his precise status amongst Hōnen&#x27;s followers is unclear as in the Seven Article Pledge, signed by Hōnen&#x27;s followers in 1204, Shinran&#x27;s signature appears near the middle among less-intimate disciples.
During his time as a disciple of Hōnen&#x27;s, Shinran caused a great stir among society by publicly getting married and eating meat. Both practices were strictly forbidden for monks, but Shinran took these drastic steps to show that Amida&#x27;s salvation is for all people and not just for monks and priests.

In 1207, the Buddhist establishment in Kyoto persuaded the military to impose a &quot;nembutsu&quot; ban, after an incident where two of Hōnen&#x27;s most prominent followers were accused of using nembutsu practice as a coverup for sexual liaisons. These two monks were subsequently executed. Hōnen and Shinran were exiled, with Shinran being defrocked and sent to Echigo Province (contemporary Niigata Prefecture). They never met each other again. Hōnen would die later in Kyoto in 1212.

Although Shinran was critical of the motivations that ultimately led to the exile, and the disruption of Hōnen&#x27;s practice community, the exile itself proved to be a critical turning point in Shinran&#x27;s religious life. Having been stripped of his monastic name, he renamed himself , coming to understand himself as neither monk nor layman. In this period, aristocratic exiles were provided land and seed and were required to take up farming, a measure designed to humiliate and humble them, which brought Shinran into the company of many of the lower social classes. While in exile, Shinran sought to continue the work of Hōnen and spread the doctrine of salvation through Amida Buddha&#x27;s compassion, as expressed through the &quot;nembutsu&quot; practice, however in time his teachings diverged from Hōnen enough that later followers would use the term Jōdo Shinshū or &quot;True Essence of the Pure Land Sect&quot;, as opposed to Jōdo-shū or &quot;Pure Land Sect&quot;.

Shinran married his wife, Eshinni, and had seven children with her.

Five years after being exiled in Echigo, in 1211, the &quot;nembutsu&quot; ban was lifted and Shinran was pardoned though he chose not to return to Kyoto at that time. Instead, Shinran left for an area known as Inada, a small area in Kantō just north of Tokyo. In 1224 Shinran authored his most significant text, Kyogyoshinsho, which is a series of selections and commentaries on Buddhist sutras supporting the new Pure Land Buddhist movement, and establishing a doctrinal lineage with Buddhist thinkers in India and China. In 1234 Shinran left the Kantō area and returned to Kyoto, with his daughter Kakushinni. On returning to Kyoto, Shinran discovered that his eldest son, Zenran (善鸞 1217?–1286?), who remained in Hitachi and Shimotsuke provinces was telling people he received special teachings from Shinran and was otherwise leading people astray. Shinran wrote stern letters to Zenran (frequently addressed by his Buddhist name ) instructing him to cease his activities, but when Zenran refused, Shinran disowned him:

Shinran died in Kyoto the year 1263 at the age of 90. Kakushinni was instrumental in maintaining the mausoleum, and passing on his teachings, with her descendants ultimately becoming the Monshu, or head of the Honganji Temples built around the Mausoleum.

== Doctrine ==
Shinran considered himself a lifelong disciple of Hōnen, in spite of their separation. According to a letter composed by his wife, Eshinni:

Hōnen&#x27;s disciples were said to have been largely divided by questions arising from the need for a single invocation (nenbutsu) of Amitabha&#x27;s name versus many-callings, and thereby emphasis on faith versus practice. Shinran, like Hōnen&#x27;s disciple Kōsai, leaned more toward faith over practice, however he did not advocate the single-recitation teaching.

While Shinran&#x27;s teachings and beliefs were generally consistent with the Pure Land Buddhist movement at the time, he also had idiosyncrasies as well:

=== Primacy of faith ===
In any case Shinran, like others in Hōnen&#x27;s community, felt that in the age of Dharma Decline, it was no longer possible to achieve enlightenment through traditional monastic practices, and thus one could only rely on the vows of Amitabha Buddha, particular the 18th or &quot;Primal Vow&quot; and seek rebirth in the Pure Land. In a passage from his magnum opus, the Kyōgyōshinshō, he writes of himself:

In this passage, Shinran explains that he not only gave up traditional monastic practices to focus on rebirth in the Pure Land, but that in time he eventually gave up on practices related to rebirth in the Pure Land, instead relying solely on faith in the vow of Amitabha Buddha.

In the &quot;Kyōgyōshinshō&quot;, third fascicle, Shinran explores the nature of , by describing it as something bestowed by Amitabha Buddha, not arising from the believer. Through this endowment, faith is awakened in a person, and the recitation of the Buddha&#x27;s name or nembutsu because an expression of praise or gratitude. However, this cannot occur until the believer fully entrusts themselves to Amitabha Buddha, even for a moment. Once this state of faith is bestowed, one is assured of rebirth in the Pure Land, and ultimately enlightenment. Shinran cautions though:

Further, once a follower has awakened to this deep faith, one should live life as an expression of gratitude, follow moral conduct and fulfill one&#x27;s social obligations. As one&#x27;s faith in Amida deepens, Shinran articulated ten spiritual benefits that develop: Protected by unseen divine beings (myoshu goji), Possessed of the supreme virtue (shitoku gusoku), Having evil turned into good (tenaku jyozen), Protected by all Buddhas (shobutsu gonen), Praised by all Buddhas (shobutsu shyosan), Protected by the Buddha&#x27;s spiritual light (shinko jogo), Having much joy in mind (shinta kangi), Acknowledging His benevolence and repaying it (chion hotoku), Always practicing the Great Compassion (jyogyo daihi), Entering the Rightly-Established Group (shojyoju ni iru).

=== Amitabha Buddha and the Pure Land ===

The last three fascicles of the &quot;Kyōgyōshinshō&quot; delve into the nature of Amitabha Buddha and the Pure Land. The Pure Land is treated as a temporary refuge whereby one can attain enlightenment, and then return to this world to lead and teach others as a bodhisattva. Elsewhere, Shinran is quoted in the as saying:

On the nature of Amitabha Buddha, Shinran stated that in their true form, both the Buddha and the Pure Land are beyond comprehension, but due to people&#x27;s ignorance and attachments they can only perceive Amitabha in terms of his physical form described in the sutras, as well as the layout of the Pure Land. If one attains true faith, then upon rebirth in the Pure Land, one can perceive their true form. However, if one&#x27;s faith is incomplete, or they continue to rely on their own efforts, then they will be reborn in the outer regions of the Pure Land, and will still perceive Amitabha Buddha through physical forms until eventually attaining true faith and proceeding further.

Shinran&#x27;s definition of Amitabha Buddha as the absolute, equating the Pure Land with Nirvana itself, therefore differed somewhat from traditional interpretations of the Pure Land in Buddhist scripture.

=== Age of Dharma decline ===

Shinran&#x27;s interpretation of the final age of the Dharma, was consistent with other Buddhist thinkers of the time. In particular, he drew inspiration from a Chinese Buddhist master named Tao-cho who centuries earlier taught that in the latter age of the Dharma the Pure Land teachings were the most suitable for the capacities of the people of the time.

Shinran felt that this decline was inevitable, that Japan was already 600 years into age of Dharma Decline, and that people were no longer capable of maintaining Buddhist practice, let alone enlightenment. Thus, only the vow of Amitabha Buddha to save all beings could be relied upon.

=== Other religious practices ===

Shinran acknowledged the religious practices of Japan outside the Buddhist tradition, including Shinto kami, spirits, divination, astrology, etc., he believed that they were irrelevant in comparison to the power of Amitabha Buddha. He developed a Japanese Buddhist heresiology that constructed other forms of religious practice as equivalent to demon-worship; his followers would later use this equivocation both to enforce proper interpretations of Shinran&#x27;s thought and to criticize &quot;heretical&quot; sects of Buddhism such as the Tachikawa-ryu. To this day, omamori, ofuda and other charms are not found in Jodo Shinshu temples.

== Cultural legacy ==
A statue of Shinran Shonin stands in Upper West Side Manhattan, in New York City on Riverside Drive between 105th and 106th Streets, in front of the New York Buddhist Church. The statue depicts Shinran in a peasant hat and sandals, holding a wooden staff, as he peers down at the sidewalk.

Although this kind of statue is very common and often found at Jōdo Shinshū temples, this particular statue is notable because it survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, standing a little more than a mile from ground zero. It was brought to New York in 1955. The plaque calls the statue &quot;a testimonial to the atomic bomb devastation and a symbol of lasting hope for world peace.&quot;

Shinran&#x27;s life was the subject of the 1987 film &quot;&quot;, directed by Rentarō Mikuni (in his directorial debut, based on his own novel) and starring Junkyu Moriyama as Shinran. The film won the Jury Prize at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.

On March 14, 2008, what are assumed to be some of the ash remains of Shinran were found in a small wooden statue at the Jōrakuji temple in Shimogyō-ku, Kyōto. The temple was created by Zonkaku (1290–1373), the son of Kakunyo (1270–1351), one of Shinran&#x27;s great grandchildren. Records indicate that Zonkaku inherited the remains of Shinran from Kakunyo. The 24.2 cm wooden statue is identified as being from the middle of the Edo period. The remains were wrapped in paper.

In March 2011, manga artist Takehiko Inoue created large ink paintings on twelve folding screens, displayed at the East Hongan Temple in Kyoto. The illustrations on the panels include Shinran and Hōnen leading a group of Heian era commoners on one set of screens and Shinran seated with a bird on the other set. Author Hiroyuki Itsuki wrote a novel based on Shinran&#x27;s life which was serialized with illustrations by Akira Yamaguchi and won the 64th Mainichi Publishing Culture Award Special Prize in 2010.

<text>Saba ( , ) is a Caribbean island and the smallest special municipality (officially &quot;public body&quot;) of the Netherlands. It consists largely of the dormant volcano Mount Scenery, which at is the highest point of the entire Kingdom of the Netherlands. The island lies in the northern Leeward Islands portion of the West Indies, southeast of the Virgin Islands. Together with Bonaire and Sint Eustatius it forms the BES islands, also known as the Caribbean Netherlands.

Saba has a land area of . The population was 1,911 in January 2022, with a population density of . It is the smallest territory by permanent population in the Americas. Its towns and major settlements are The Bottom (the capital), Windwardside, Zion&#x27;s Hill, and St. Johns.

==Etymology==
Theories about the origin of Saba&#x27;s name include &quot;siba&quot; (the Arawakan word for &#x27;rock&#x27;), &quot;sabot&quot;, , and Sheba. The island was referred to by its present name, Saba, as early as 1595 when it appeared in a voyage account by John Hawkins. Before its present name, the island was designated &quot;St. Christopher&quot; (San Cristóbal) by Christopher Columbus.

==History==
=== Precolonial ===

Indigenous people most likely first set foot on Saba around 1875 BC. On the basis of the navigational skills required, South America seems to have offered the most favourable conditions for reaching Lesser Antillean islands such as Saba.

Over 20 pre-Columbian sites have been found in Saba. The main occupation in Saba seems to have occurred between AD 400 and 1450. During this time the inhabitants of Saba were full horticulturalists living from the cultivation of root crops and the exploitation of the marine environment. They produced pottery vessels, made tools and sculptured objects from stone, shell, animal, bone, and coral.

=== Colonial ===
Christopher Columbus is said to have sighted the island on 13November 1493, however, he did not land, being deterred by the island&#x27;s perilous rocky shores. In 1632, a group of shipwrecked Englishmen landed upon Saba. In the 1640s, the Dutch governor of the neighbouring island of Sint Eustatius sent several Dutch families over to colonise the island for the Dutch West India Company. In 1664, refusing to swear allegiance to the English crown, these original Dutch settlers were evicted to St.Maarten by Jamaican governors pirates Edward, Thomas, and Henry Morgan. The Netherlands eventually gained complete control of the island in 1816.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
In the 17th and 18th centuries, Saba&#x27;s major industries were sugar, indigo, and rum produced on plantations owned by Dutchmen living on St. Eustatius, and later fishing, particularly lobster fishing. To work these plantations, enslaved people were imported from Africa. In the 17th century, Saba was believed to be a favourite hideout for Jamaican pirates. England also deported its &quot;undesirable&quot; people to live in the Caribbean colonies, and some of them also became pirates, a few taking haven on Saba. As the island&#x27;s coast is forbidding and steep, the island became a private sanctuary for the families of smugglers and pirates. One notable Saban pirate was Hiram Beakes, son of the Dutch councillor of the island.

In August 1857, Venezuela and The Netherlands submitted a dispute over the possession of Isla de Aves to arbitration by the Queen of Spain, because the Netherlands considered the island linked to its colony of Saba by a sand bank, and fishermen from St. Eustatius and Saba had used the place to harvest turtles and birds&#x27; eggs, while Venezuela argued that it had inherited the island from Spain which had discovered all the Caribbean islands, that the fishermen were not acting on behalf of any government but for a particular interest and that this island was not attached to the territory that the Netherlands had received.

The Spanish decision of June 30, 1865, declared that the ownership of the Island belonged to Venezuela and that the Netherlands should nevertheless be compensated. It argued that even if the two islands had been united, the sandbank was now separate from the island of Saba and that the first state to have a military force and to exercise sovereignty there had been Venezuela, which had inherited it from the Captaincy General of Venezuela.

During that time, Saba lace, a Spanish form of needlework introduced by a nun from Venezuela, became an important product made by the island&#x27;s women. Throughout the late 19thcentury and early 20thcentury, the primary source of revenue for the island came from the lacework produced by these women. During this period of time, with most of the island&#x27;s men gone out to sea for extended periods, the island became known as &quot;The Island of Women&quot;.

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
In 1943, Joseph &quot;Lambee&quot; Hassell, a self-taught engineer, designed the road on Saba, which was built by hand by island residents. It drastically changed transport on the island, which had been carried out only by foot or by mule previously. An airport followed in 1963, and a larger pier geared for tourist boats in 1972. As a result, tourism increased, gradually becoming a major part of the Saban economy.

In 1978, Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands signed the maritime limits treaty that defined the extension of the Dutch and Venezuelan exclusive economic zone in two areas, the first between the islands of Aruba, Curaçao, and Bonaire (in front of the State of Falcon in Venezuela and next to the Los Monjes Archipelago) and a second area further north that includes the islands of Saba and St. Eustatius, the latter taking as a reference the Isla de Aves (the northernmost point of Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea). At that time, the six islands were part of an administrative entity called the Netherlands Antilles. The treaty recognizes an equidistant or median line between the Island of Aves and the Island of Saba as a maritime boundary.

A status referendum was held in Saba on 5November 2004, and 86.05% of the population voted for closer links to the Netherlands. This was duly achieved in October 2010, when the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and Saba became a special municipality of the Netherlands.

==Geography and ecology==
Saba is a small island at in size and roughly circular in shape. It lies north-west of Sint Eustatius and south-west of Saint Barthélemy and Sint Maarten. The terrain is generally mountainous, and the centre of the island is dominated by its volcanic peak, Mount Scenery, which stands above sea level. Off the north coast lies the much smaller Green Island.

Saba is the northernmost active volcano in the Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc chain of islands. At , Mount Scenery is also the highest point within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The island is composed of a single rhombus-shaped volcano measuring east to west and north to south The oldest dated rocks on Saba are around 400,000 years old, and the most recent eruption was shortly before the 1630s European settlement. Between 1995 and 1997, an increase in local seismic activity was associated with a rise in the temperature of the hot springs on the island&#x27;s northwest and southeast coasts.

Being an island, Saba is home to a number of endemic species including the Saban black iguana (&quot;Iguana iguana melanoderma&quot;), Red-bellied racer (&quot;Alsophis rufiventris&quot;), Saban anole (&quot;Anolis sabanus&quot;), and Lesser Antillean funnel-eared bat (&quot;Natalus stramineus stramineus&quot;). However, several non-native species have settled on the island, including the Underwood&#x27;s spectacled tegu (&quot;Gymnophthalmus underwoodi&quot;), brahminy blind snake (&quot;Indotyphlops braminus&quot;), and non-native iguanas, all of which are believed to have arrived on cargo shipments from St. Maarten.

=== Climate ===
Due to its considerable relief Saba boasts a higher level of precipitation than other islands. At present, the island&#x27;s climate is very similar to that of mainland South America. The yearly climate of Saba can be divided into three intervals: dry, intermediate and wet periods. The dry period lasts from January to May with a monthly rainfall of around 50 to 100 mm (2.0 to 3.9 in). The intermediate period extends from May to September, when rainfall is moderate. The final months of the year represent the wet season when precipitation is high. The temperature at sea is approximately 25 °C (77 °F).

=== Cloud Forest ===
There is an cloud forest located at and above on top of the mountain referred to as the &quot;Elfin Forest Reserve&quot; because of its high altitude mist and mossy appearance. The most dominant tree in the cloud forest is the Mountain Mahogany (&quot;Freziera undulate&quot;), although hurricanes over the years have destroyed a large number of the mature trees. Despite the name, the mountain mahogany is not related to other mahogany species; although one species of true mahogany tree is found on the island at lower levels, the small-leaved mahogany (&quot;Swietenia mahagoni&quot;). In the underbrush of the mahogany trees, the Sierran palm (&quot;Prestoea montana&quot;) and tree ferns dominate, with a large variety of epiphytes and Orchids growing on the trunks and branches of all the trees. Wild raspberries and plantain trees can also be found growing on most of the mountain. All seven of the Lesser Antilles Endemic Bird Area restricted-range birds occur in the Elfin Forest Reserve.

=== Forests ===
Below the cloud forest is a sub-montane forest, and the variety and average number of species are considerably less. Redwood and Mountain fuchsia tree trees grow wild in this zone, as well as cactus species such as the prickly pear, and Seagrape trees. On the lowest southern and eastern slopes of Saba are grassy meadows and scattered shrubs. is a national park located on the north coast of Saba. Formerly owned by the Sulphur Mining Company, the park was established in January 1998 and the property was officially turned over to the Saba Conservation Foundation in 1999. It stretches from the coastline all the way up to the cloud forest, and encompasses all vegetation zones present on Saba.

=== Coastline ===
The coastline of Saba is mostly rubble and rocky cliffs that are or taller with mostly cobble and boulder permanent beaches. The steep terrain and sheer bluffs dropping almost straight down to the ocean&#x27;s edge prevents the formation of mangrove swamps or much vegetation. There are eight bays tucked into the cliffs around the island; Cove Bay, Spring Bay, Core Gut Bay, Fort Bay (location of the island&#x27;s only port), Tent Bay, Ladder Bay, Wells Bay and Cave of Rum Bay. Saba&#x27;s coastline also includes the Flat Point Tide Pools, which were created by a large lava flow thousands of years ago. These tide pools are located below the airport at Flat Point, and feature large lava rock formations filled with colorful saltwater pools. The pools are home to diverse marine life, including small fish, sea urchins, crabs, and sea flora.

The shoreline of the island is of particular value to sea birds, and has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA AN006 – &quot;Saba Coastline&quot;) by BirdLife International. Saba is home to about sixty species of birds, many of which are sea birds that use the holes and crevices of the steep cliffs and two small islands for breeding and feed in the waters around the island. Saba&#x27;s shoreline is home to the Caribbean&#x27;s largest breeding colony of Red-billed tropicbird (&quot;Phaethon aethereus&quot;). Other birds include the Common Ground Dove, the Brown Noddy, the Least Sandpiper, and the Yellow-billed Tropicbird. The Audubon&#x27;s Shearwater (&quot;Puffinus lherminieri&quot;) is another common bird, and is the national bird of Saba as well as being featured on their coat of arms.

About southwest of the island is the northeastern edge of the Saba Bank, the largest submarine atoll in the Atlantic Ocean with an especially rich biodiversity. Saba Bank is the top of a sea mount and it is a prime fishing ground, particularly for lobster.

==Government==
===Relationship with mainland Netherlands===
Saba became a special municipality within the country of the Netherlands after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles on 10 October 2010 and is not part of a Dutch province. The island&#x27;s constitutional status, as well as those of Sint Eustatius and Bonaire, is set out in the Law on the Public Entities BES (Dutch: Wet op de Openbare Lichamen BES).

Sabans vote for members of the Dutch House of Representatives, the members of which are elected on a party-list proportional method. During the 2017 Dutch general election, a majority of Sabans voted for Democrats 66. Of the island&#x27;s 2,000 residents, 900 were eligible to vote, and of those, 42.8% (or 385 people) voted.

Sabans with Dutch nationality are allowed to vote in elections for the Electoral College to elect the members of the Dutch Senate. The 2019 elections on Saba, held concurrently with the 2019 Island Council Elections resulted in four of the five Saban seats in the Electoral College going to the Windward Islands People&#x27;s Movement and one seat going to the Saba Labour Party.

===Governor===
The island governor is the head of the government of Saba. The Dutch monarch appoints the governor for a term of six years. The governor falls under the supervision of the minister of the interior and kingdom relations. The island governor chairs meetings of both the Island Council and the Executive Council.

They are also responsible for representing the island&#x27;s government both in and out of court, maintaining public order, implementing policy and legislation, coordinating with other governments, and receiving and handling complaints about the island&#x27;s government.

The incumbent island governor is Jonathan G. A. Johnson.

===Legislature===
Saba&#x27;s legislative body is the Island Council, of which there are five members. Councillors are elected by the citizens of the island every four years. The Island Council holds the power to:
* Appoint and remove commissioners of the Executive Council.
* Pass ordinances to be enforced by the Executive Council.
* Ask questions of the Executive Council.
* Begin an investigation into the governor or the Executive Council.
* Approve the budget.

Following the 2023 island elections, the Windward Islands People&#x27;s Movement (WIPM) holds three seats on the Island Council, while the new Party for Progress, Equality, and Prosperity held two. In 2019, Esmeralda Johnson was the youngest person ever to be elected to the council.

Members of the Island Council are:
===Executive===
The Executive Council, appointed by the Island Council, acts as the executive branch of government. The council has the following responsibilities:

* Day-to-day administration of the island, except for duties reserved for the Island Council or the governor.
* Executing policies and legislation passed by the Island Council.
* Establishing rules regarding the administration of the island, except the Registry.
* Appointing, promoting, suspending, or dismissing public officials, except those working for and including the registrar.
* Preparing defence of the island.
* Maintaining contact with Dutch ministries in the Hague.
* Executing policies and legislation from the national government.

The council appoints the island secretary, currently Tim Muller.

The council consists of the island governor and two commissioners appointed by the Island Council, currently both members of the WIPM. Each member of the Executive Council is assigned portfolios to oversee.

The population of Saba was 2,060 on January 1st, 2024. Saba&#x27;s small size has led to a fairly small number of island families, who can trace their last names back to around a half-dozen families. This means that many last names are shared across the island, the most numerous being Hassell, Johnson and Every; these three names are shared by upwards of 30% of Saba&#x27;s population. 

Most families&#x27; ancestry is a result of the intermixing of Africans, Dutch, English, and Scottish. The population is also partly descended from the Irish who were exiled from that country after the accession of King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1625. Charles exiled these Irish to the Caribbean in an effort to quell a rebellion after he had forcibly procured their lands for his Scottish noble supporters.

Historically, Saba was traded among the many European nations that fought for power in the region. Slaves from Africa were also imported to work on Saba. In recent years Saba has become home to a large group of expatriates, and around 250 immigrants who are either students or teachers at the Saba University School of Medicine.

===Languages===
Both English and Dutch are spoken on the island and taught in schools, and both languages are official. Despite the island&#x27;s Dutch affiliation, English is the principal language spoken on the island and has been used in its school system since the 19th century. Dutch is spoken by 34% of the population, while English is spoken by over 96% of the population.

The majority (67%) of Sabans speak more than one language, including English, Dutch, Spanish, Papiamento, and many others. 

English is the medium of instruction in Saba schools. Dutch government policy towards Saba and other SSS islands promotes English-medium education. English can therefore be used in communications of and to the government.

Saban English is the local English vernacular spoken on the island. It has previously been described as a decreolized variety of Virgin Islands Creole English. The first dictionary of Saban English was published in 2016.

===Religion===

Saba has a predominantly Christian population. The main denominations are Catholicism (45%), Non-denominational Christianity (18%), Anglicanism (9%), Evangelicalism (4%), and Pentecostalism 4%, with an additional 11% adhering to other Christian denominations. In addition, 6% of the population is Muslim.

The first contact with Christians on the island occurred with the visit of Christopher Columbus in 1493, but this did not mean the immediate arrival of the Catholic Church. It is believed that the first Christian groups to settle on the island were Protestants coming from the Netherlands in 1640.

During the period of nominal Spanish domination, the island was included in the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Puerto Rico

The oldest church on record is the Christuskerk (Christ Church), of the Anglican denomination, which was renovated in 1777 after being damaged by a hurricane, and whose exact date of construction is unknown. In the same year, Pastor Kirkpatrick also requested permission from the Dutch commander Johannes de Graaff to officially establish the Anglican Church in Saba before that some locals used the Reformed Church of the Netherlands to celebrate their baptisms.

Although the Roman Catholic Church is currently very active on Saba, it did not establish itself on the island until quite late. One of the earliest contacts includes the visit of Père Labat in 1701.

The island was also visited by the Prefect Apostolic of the Catholic Church for the Dutch Colonies in the Caribbean in 1836 Monsignor Martinus Niewindt, according to his report there was no Catholic priest to attend the island at that time. He returned in May of the same year with the Venezuelan priest Manuel Romero who had settled in Curaçao 1 year earlier for political reasons. Communication was difficult at first because neither of the two priests spoke English, Romero spoke only Spanish and Niewindt spoke only French and Dutch. In June 1836, the first Catholic mass on the island was officially celebrated in Saba, and five children were presented for baptism.

The oldest Catholic Church on record and still functioning today is St. Paul&#x27;s Conversion Church in Windward, which dates back to 1860.

Missionary activity, the arrival of immigrants from other parts of the Netherlands and other territories in the Caribbean and Europe made the Catholic Church the most popular denomination in the present day, as it represents nearly half of the population.

=== Health and healthcare ===
The A.M. Edwards Medical Center is the major provider of healthcare for local residents. The center was built in 1980 and renovated in 2019. Home healthcare is available for Sabans who require medical care in their own home. Saba also has an assisted living facility located in the H.C. Every building. There is also a basic pharmacy.

Saba has a hyperbaric chamber located at Fort Bay Harbor, as scuba diving is a popular tourist activity on Saba.

===LGBTQ Rights===
&quot;For further reading, visit main article at: LGBTQ rights in Saba&quot; 

In Saba (as in Bonaire and Sint Eustatius), marriage is open to same sex and opposite sex couples following the entering in force of a law enabling same-sex couples to marry on 10 October 2012. The first same-sex marriage was performed on Saba on 4 December 2012 between a Dutch man and a Venezuelan man, both residing in Aruba, where same-sex marriage is not performed.
==Economy==
Since 2011, the U.S. dollar has been the official currency, replacing the Netherlands Antillean guilder.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture on Saba is primarily livestock and vegetables, especially potatoes. Saba lace, also known as &quot;Spanish work&quot;, is actually drawn thread work and is still produced on the island.

===Tourism===

The tourism industry now contributes more to the island&#x27;s economy than any other sector. There are about 15,000 visitors each year. Saba has a number of inns, hotels, rental cottages and restaurants. Saba is known as the &quot;Unspoiled Queen&quot; of the Caribbean. Saba is especially known for its ecotourism, having exceptional scuba diving, climbing and hiking.

The Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport offers flights to and from the nearby islands of St. Maarten and Sint Eustatius. There is also a ferry service from St. Maarten; the ferry boats &quot;Dawn II ~ The Saba Ferry&quot; and &quot;The Edge&quot; both travel to Saba three times a week. In addition, there are anchorages for private boats.

About 150 species of fish have been found in Saba&#x27;s waters. A main draw for divers are the pinnacle dive sites, where magma pushed through the sea floor to create underwater towers of volcanic rock that start at about down and rise to about beneath the surface. The waters around Saba were designated as the Saba National Marine Park in 1987, and are subject to government regulation to preserve the coral reefs and other marine life. Since 1991 the Saba Conservation Foundation has operated a hyperbaric chamber in case of diving emergencies.

===Transport===

There is one main road, known as &quot;The Road&quot;. Its construction was masterminded by Josephus Lambert Hassell who, contrary to the opinion of Dutch and Swiss engineers, believed that a road could be built. He took a correspondence course in civil engineering and started building the road with a crew of locals in 1938. In 1943, the first section of the road from Fort Bay to The Bottom was completed. In 1947, the first motor vehicle arrived. In 1951, the road to Windwardside and St. Johns was opened. In 1958, the road was completed.

Driving &quot;The Road&quot; is considered to be a daunting task, and the curves in Windwardside are extremely difficult to negotiate. Driving is on the right hand side. The speed limit in towns is , and outside of towns, is .

In 1963, Saba residents built the Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport. This landing strip is reputed to be the shortest commercial runway in the world, and is restricted. Only trained pilots flying small STOL airliners, such as the Twin Otter and the Britten-Norman Islander, may land there, as well as helicopters.

In 1972, a pier was completed in Fort Bay to access the island. Travel is also provided by ferry services to and from Sint Maarten with the &quot;Makana&quot; and &quot;The Edge&quot; ferries.

Of note are 800 steps carved from stone, known as &quot;The Ladder&quot;, which reach from Ladder Bay to the settlement known as The Bottom. Until the late 20th century, everything that was brought to the island in boats and ships was carried up by hand using these steps. The steps are now often used by tourists who wish to experience an intense climb.

There is a bus system on the island, and the 2024-2029 transportation plan calls for bus shelters in every village.

===Energy===
Like many Caribbean islands, Saba is dependent on fossil fuels imports, which leaves it vulnerable to global oil price fluctuations that directly affect the cost of electricity. Electricity supply depends on a diesel power plant to supply 60% of the island&#x27;s demand. In 2019, solar parks in Hell&#x27;s Gate (adjacent to the airport) and The Bottom became operational. For up to 10 hours a day, the entire island of Saba is powered by solar energy from these two solar parks and their battery storage.

According to a report by the Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP), the Government of Saba made the decision to transform the island to 100% sustainable energy to eventually eliminate dependence on fossil fuel-generated electricity. This new energy policy is defined by the &#x27;Social development plan 2014–2020&#x27; and &#x27;Saba&#x27;s energy sector strategy&#x27;. Intermediate targets are 20% renewable electricity by 2017, which was reached in 2018; and 40% by 2020, which is expected to be reached by March 2019.

=== Poverty ===
There is poverty on Saba, although there is social pressure to keep this hidden. Rent is unaffordable for many local residents on the island, pressures include the high cost of utilities and groceries, as well as limited housing.

There is a heavy dependence on imported food. Grocery day is Wednesday, with food arriving from Miami each week. Local efforts at addressing food insecurity include subsidized animal feed (shipped in from Puerto Rico) and a Farmer&#x27;s Market truck (&quot;roving farmer&#x27;s market&quot;). There is also a &quot;public-private partnership between the [Dutch] public entity and the United States-based corporation Gezondheid Farms&quot; to increase access to hydroponically-grown local produce. Over 100 food trees were distributed at a World Food Day event in 2024.

== Education ==
The primary school is Sacred Heart Primary School in St. John&#x27;s. There is also one secondary and vocational school in Saba, the Saba Comprehensive School in St. John&#x27;s.

Saba University School of Medicine is a for-profit medical school located in The Bottom, Saba&#x27;s capital. The medical school was established by American expatriates in coordination with the government of the Netherlands. The school adds over 400 residents when classes are in session, and it is the prime educational attraction.

== Culture ==

The lifestyle on Saba is generally slow with little nightlife, even with the emergence of an ecotourism industry in the last few decades. Sabans are proud of their history of environmental conservation, calling Saba &quot;The Unspoiled Queen&quot;.
Saban women continue to make two traditional island products, Saba Lace and Saba Spice. Saba Lace is hand-stitched lace, which the island&#x27;s women began making in the late 19th century and built into a thriving mail-order business with the United States. Saba Spice is a rum drink, brewed with a combination of spices.

As in other Caribbean locations, Sabans throw an annual Carnival. Saba&#x27;s Carnival takes place the last week in July and includes parades, steel bands, competitions, and food.

Another event held in the capital The Bottom is &#x27;Saba Day&#x27;. This is the national day of the island in which all offices, schools and stores are closed. The island celebrates its diversity and culture through various activities and parades. The Bottom holds host to a concert at the sports field where local and other Caribbean artists come to perform. A wahoo fishing tournament is also held during Saba Day and attracts boats from neighboring islands such as St. Maarten, St. Eustatius, and St. Barths.

=== Media ===
There is one radio station on Saba, &quot;Saba Radio&quot; broadcasts on 93.9 FM and 1410 AM.

There is one online newspaper in Saba, &quot;Saba News&quot;, which publishes local news as well as pieces from the rest of the Dutch Caribbean.

=== Museums ===
The Harry L. Johnson Museum in Windwardside features exhibits that include collections from the 19th and early 20th centuries, including period photographs of Dutch royalty, antique furniture, a 100-year old organ harmonium, and a stone hearth, as well as objects from archaeological sites of the island&#x27;s first inhabitants.

The Bottom&#x27;s Major Osman Ralph Simmons Museum, founded by Major Osmar Ralph Simmons, a former island police officer for more than 40 years, preserves and displays objects he found on the island.

=== Sports ===

<text>Sint Eustatius ( , ), known locally as Statia ( ), is an island in the Caribbean. It is a special municipality (officially &quot;public body&quot;) of the Netherlands. 

The island is in the northern Leeward Islands, southeast of the Virgin Islands. Sint Eustatius is immediately to the northwest of Saint Kitts and southeast of Saba. The regional capital is Oranjestad. The island has an area of . Travelers to the island by air arrive through F. D. Roosevelt Airport. 

Formerly part of the Netherlands Antilles, Sint Eustatius became a public body of the Netherlands in 2010. It is part of the Dutch Caribbean, which consists of Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Saba, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten. Together with Bonaire and Saba, it forms the BES Islands, also referred to as the Caribbean Netherlands.

== Etymology ==
The island&#x27;s name, Sint Eustatius, is Dutch for Saint Eustace (also spelled Eustachius or Eustathius), a legendary Christian martyr, known in Spanish as &quot;San Eustaquio&quot; and in Portuguese as &quot;Santo Eustáquio&quot; or &quot;Santo Eustácio&quot;.

The island&#x27;s prior Dutch name was &quot;Nieuw Zeeland&quot; (&#x27;New Zeeland&#x27;), named by the Zeelanders who settled there in the 1630s. It was renamed Sint Eustatius shortly thereafter. 

The indigenous name for the island is &quot;Aloi&quot; meaning &quot;cashew island&quot; (origin Arawak). 

==History==
The earliest inhabitants were Caribs believed to have come from the Amazon basin (South America) and migrated north from Venezuela via the Lesser Antilles. In the early 20th century, settlement traces were discovered at Golden Rock and Orange Bay. Multiple pre-Columbian sites have been found on the island, most notably the site referred to as the &quot;Golden Rock Site&quot;. 

While the island may have been seen by Christopher Columbus in 1493, the first recorded sighting was ‌in ‌1595 by Sir‌ ‌Francis‌ ‌Drake‌ ‌and‌ ‌Sir‌ ‌John‌ ‌Hawkins‌.‌ From the first European settlement in the 17th century, until the early 19th century, St. Eustatius changed hands twenty-one times between the Netherlands, Britain, and France.

In 1625, English and French settlers arrived on the island. In 1629, the French built a wooden battery at the present-day location of Fort Oranje. Both the English and the French left the island within a few years due to lack of drinkable water.

In 1636, the chamber of Zeeland of the Dutch West India Company took possession of the island, reported to be uninhabited at the time. In 1678 the islands of St. Eustatius, Sint Maarten and Saba were under the direct command of the Dutch West India Company, with a commander stationed on St. Eustatius to govern all three. At the time, the island was of some importance for the cultivation of tobacco and sugar. More important was the role of St. Eustatius in the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the intercolonial slave trade.

===Slave trade and free port===
Sint Eustatius became the most profitable asset of the Dutch West India Company and a transit point for enslaved Africans in the transatlantic slave trade. The ruins of the Waterfort on the southwest coast of the island are reminders of this past. A slave house of two floors was in the Waterfort. Plantations of sugarcane, cotton, tobacco, coffee and indigo were established on the island and worked with labor of enslaved Africans. In 1774 there were 75 plantations on the island with names such as Gilboa, Kuilzak, Zelandia, Zorg en Rust, Nooit Gedacht, Ruym Sigt and Golden Rock.

In the 18th century, St. Eustatius&#x27;s geographical placement in the middle of Danish (Virgin Islands), British (Jamaica, St. Kitts, Barbados, Antigua), French (St. Domingue, Ste. Lucie, Martinique, Guadeloupe) and Spanish (Cuba, Santo Domingo, Puerto Rico) territories—along with its large harborage, neutrality and status from 1756 as a free port with no customs duties—were all factors in it becoming a major point of transhipment of captured Africans, goods, and a locus for trade in contraband. Transshipment of captured Africans to the British, French, and Spanish islands of the eastern Caribbean was significant enough that the colonists built a two-story slave house at the fortress Amsterdam (also known as Waterfort) to serve as a depot of enslaved Africans until around 1740. The depot housed about 400–450 people. St. Eustatius&#x27;s economy flourished under the Dutch by ignoring the monopolistic trade restrictions of the British, French and Spanish islands; it became known as the &quot;Golden Rock&quot;. Edmund Burke said of the island in 1781:
&quot;It has no produce, no fortifications for its defence, nor martial spirit nor military regulations ... Its utility was its defence. The universality of its use, the neutrality of its nature was its security and its safeguard. Its proprietors had, in the spirit of commerce, made it an emporium for all the world. ... Its wealth was prodigious, arising from its industry and the nature of its commerce.&quot;

===&quot;First Salute&quot;===
The island sold arms and ammunition to anyone willing to pay, and it was therefore one of the few places from which the young United States could obtain military stores. The good relationship between St. Eustatius and the United States resulted in the noted &quot;First Salute&quot;.

On 16 November 1776, the 14-gun American brig &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; commanded by Captain Isaiah Robinson sailed, flying the Continental Colors of the fledgling United States, into the anchorage below St. Eustatius&#x27;s Fort Oranje. Robinson announced his arrival by firing a thirteen gun salute, one gun for each of the thirteen American colonies in rebellion against Britain. Governor Johannes de Graaff replied with an eleven-gun salute from the cannons of Fort Oranje (international protocol required two guns fewer to acknowledge a sovereign flag). It was the first international acknowledgment of American independence. The &quot;Andrew Doria&quot; had arrived to purchase munitions for the American Revolutionary forces. She was carrying a copy of the Declaration of Independence which was presented to Governor De Graaff. An earlier copy had been captured by the British on its way to Holland. It was wrapped in documents that the British believed to be a strange cipher, but were actually written in Yiddish, addressed to Jewish merchants in Holland.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited St. Eustatius for two hours on 27 February 1939 on USS &quot;Houston&quot; to recognise the importance of the 1776 &quot;First Salute&quot;. He presented a large brass plaque to St. Eustatius, displayed today under a flagpole atop the walls of Fort Oranje, reading:

&quot;In commemoration to the salute to the flag of the United States, Fired in this fort November 16. 1776, By order of Johannes de Graaff, Governor of Saint Eustatius, In reply to a National Gun-Salute, Fired by the United States Brig of War Andrew Doria, Under Captain Isaiah Robinson of the Continental Navy, Here the sovereignty of the United States of America was first formally acknowledged to a national vessel by a foreign official. Presented by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President of the United States of America&quot;

The recognition provided the title for Barbara W. Tuchman&#x27;s 1988 book &quot;The First Salute: A View of the American Revolution&quot;.

===Capture by British Admiral Rodney 1781===
The British took the Andrew Doria incident seriously, and protested bitterly against the continuous trade between the United Colonies and St. Eustatius. In 1778, Lord Stormont claimed in Parliament that, &quot;if Sint Eustatius had sunk into the sea three years before, the United Kingdom would already have dealt with George Washington&quot;. Nearly half of all American Revolutionary military supplies were obtained through St. Eustatius. Nearly all American communications to Europe first passed through the island. The trade between St. Eustatius and the United States was the main reason for the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War of 1780–1784. Notably, the British Admiral George Brydges Rodney, having occupied the island for Great Britain in 1781, urged the commander of the landing troops, Major-General Sir John Vaughan, to seize &quot;Mr. Smith at the house of Jones – they (the Jews of St. Eustatius, Caribbean Antilles) cannot be too soon taken care of – they are notorious in the cause of America and France.&quot; The war was disastrous for the Dutch economy.

Britain declared war on the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands on 20 December 1780. Even before officially declaring war, Britain had outfitted a massive battle fleet to take and destroy the weapons depot and vital commercial centre that St. Eustatius had become. British Admiral George Brydges Rodney was appointed the commander of the battle fleet. 3 February 1781, the massive fleet of 15 ships of the line and numerous smaller ships transporting over 3,000 soldiers appeared before St. Eustatius prepared to invade. Governor De Graaff did not know about the declaration of war. Rodney offered De Graaff a bloodless surrender to his superior force. Rodney had more than 1,000 cannon to De Graaff&#x27;s one dozen cannon and a garrison of sixty men. De Graaff surrendered the island, but first fired two rounds as a show of resistance in honour of Dutch Admiral Lodewijk van Bylandt, who commanded a ship of the Dutch Navy which was in the harbor. Ten months later, the island was conquered by the French, allies of the Dutch Republic in the war. The Dutch regained control over the looted and plundered island in 1784.

A series of French and British occupations of Sint Eustatius from 1795 to 1815 during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars diverted trade to the occupiers&#x27; islands. St. Eustatius&#x27;s economy collapsed, and the merchants, including the Jews left. St. Eustatius reverted permanently to Dutch control from 1816.

At its peak, St. Eustatius may have had a largely transient population of about 10,000 people. Most were engaged in commercial and maritime interests. A census list of 1790 gives a total population (free and enslaved people combined) of 8,124. Commerce revived after the island returned to Dutch control. Many of the merchants (including the Jews) returned to the island. However, the French and British occupations disrupted trade and also the Americans, now globally recognised as an independent nation, had meanwhile developed their own trading network and did not need St. Eustatius anymore. The island was eclipsed by other Dutch ports, such as those on the islands of Curaçao and Sint Maarten. During the last years of the 18th century Statia developed trade in bay rum. The economy declined in the early 19th century. From about 1795 the population declined, dropping to 921 in 1948.

===Jewish population===

The first record of Jews on St. Eustatius dates to 1660. The Jews were mainly merchants with significant international trading and maritime commercial ties. Jews were captains, owners or co-owners with Christian partners, of significant numbers of ships originating out of St. Eustatius. A few were island plantation owners. Jews were estimated to have composed at least 10% of the permanent population of St. Eustatius. Ten days after the island surrendered to the British on 3 February 1781, Rodney ordered that the entire Jewish male adult population assemble for him. They were rounded up and thirty one heads of families were summarily deported to St. Kitts without word or mercy to their dependents. The choice of exiling the Jews to St. Kitts was significant. The nearby British colony of Nevis had a large Jewish population and an established community capable of aiding the refugees. St. Kitts did not have any Jewish community or population. The other seventy-one were locked up in the weighing house in Lower Town where they were held for three days.

Expulsion of Americans followed on 23 February, of merchants from Amsterdam on 24 February and of other Dutch citizens and Frenchmen on 5 March. The crews of the Dutch ships Rodney took were sent to St. Kitts for imprisonment – after first stripping them of all their belongings. Because of their maltreatment, many perished. The Jews were well received on St. Kitts – where many knew them as their respected business partners. They were supported in their protest against their deportation and it proved successful. They were allowed to return to St. Eustatius after a few weeks to observe all their property being sold at small fractions of the original value after having been confiscated by Rodney. There were numerous complaints about &quot;individuals of both sexes being halted in the streets and being body searched in a most scandalous way.&quot; Pieter Runnels, an eighty-year-old member of the island council and captain of the civic guard, did not survive the rough treatment he received aboard Rodney&#x27;s ship. He, a member of one of the island&#x27;s oldest-established families, became the only civilian casualty of the British occupation. 

Rodney singled out the Jews: the harshness was reserved for them alone. He did not do the same to French, Dutch, Spanish or even the American merchants on the island. He permitted the French to leave with all their possessions. Rodney was concerned that his unprecedented behavior would be repeated upon British islands by French forces when events were different. However, Governor De Graaff was also deported. As he did with all other warehouses, Rodney confiscated the Jewish warehouses, looted Jewish personal possessions, even cutting the lining of their clothes to find money hidden in there. When Rodney realized that the Jews might be hiding additional treasure, he dug up the Jewish cemetery.

Later, in February 1782, Edmund Burke, the leading opposition member of the Whig Party, upon learning of Rodney&#x27;s actions in St. Eustatius, rose to condemn Rodney&#x27;s actions in Parliament:
...and a sentence of general beggary pronounced in one moment upon a whole people. A cruelty unheard of in Europe for many years… The persecution was begun with the people whom of all others it ought to be the care and the wish of human nations to protect, the Jews… the links of communication, the mercantile chain… the conductors by which credit was transmitted through the world... a resolution taken to banish this unhappy people from the island. They suffered in common with the rest of the inhabitants, the loss of their merchandise, their bills, their houses, and their provisions; and after this they were ordered to quit the island, and only one day was given them for preparation; they petitioned, they remonstrated against so hard a sentence, but in vain; it was irrevocable.

====The synagogue and the cemetery====
From about 1815, when there was no longer a viable Jewish community using and maintaining the synagogue on St. Eustatius, it gradually fell into ruin.

The synagogue building, known as Honen Dalim, (חונן דלים, He who is charitable to the Poor) was built in 1737. Permission for building the synagogue came from the Dutch West India Company, additional funding came from the Jewish community on Curaçao. Permission was conditional on the fact that the Jewish house of worship would be sited where &quot;the exercise of their (Jewish) religious duties would not molest those of the Gentiles&quot;. The building is off a small lane called Synagogue Path, away from the main street. The synagogue attested to the wealth of the Jews of St. Eustatius and their influence on the island.
In 2001, its walls were restored as part of the Historic Core Restoration Project, although there are no known images showing what the synagogue looked like when still in use, so that archeological research is attempting to restore the structure to the best estimate of its former condition. The grounds include a Jewish ritual bath (mikveh) and an oven used on Passover. A restored and respectfully maintained Jewish cemetery is next to the Old Church Cemetery, at the top of Oranjestad, Sint Eustatius.

===Slave Revolt of 1848===
After 1848, slavery only existed on the Dutch and Danish Eastern Caribbean islands, which caused unrest on the islands colonized by the Netherlands. As a result, a proclamation declared on 6 June 1848 on Sint Maarten that enslaved Africans would be treated as free persons.

Unrest also arose on Sint Eustatius. On 12 June 1848, a group of free and enslaved Africans gathered in front of Lieutenant Governor Johannes de Veer&#x27;s home demanding their declaration of liberty, increased rations, and more free hours. The Island Governor addressed the group, but it persisted in its demands. The militia was mobilized and, after consultation with the Colonial Council and the main residents, an attack was decided by the Lieutenant Governor. After another warning to leave the city or otherwise experience the consequences, fire was opened on the group. The insurgents fled the city, leaving two or three seriously injured. From a hill just outside the city they pelted the militia with stones and pieces of rock. A group of 35 shooters stormed the hill, killing two insurgents and injuring several. The six leaders of the uprising were exiled from the island and transferred to Curaçao. Thomas Dupersoy, a free African, is considered the chief leader of the uprising. One of the other leaders sent a death notice to his owner in 1851. After the uprising, the largest plantation owners on Sint Eustatius decided to give their enslaved workers a certain wage for fear of repetition of revolt.

===Abolition of slavery===
In 1863 slavery was officially abolished in the Netherlands. The Dutch were among the last to abolish slavery. The freed slaves no longer wanted to live in the field and moved to the city. Due to a lack of trade, the bay of Sint Eustatius underwent a recession. Natural disasters such as the hurricane of September 1928 and May 1929 accelerated the process of economic decline on the island.

===Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles===
Sint Eustatius became a member of the Netherlands Antilles when that grouping was created in 1954. Between 2000 and 2005 the member islands of the Netherlands Antilles voted on their future status. In a referendum on 8 April 2005, 77% of Sint Eustatius voters voted to remain within the Netherlands Antilles, compared to 21% who voted for closer ties with the Netherlands. None of the other islands voted to remain.

After the other islands decided to leave, ending the Netherlands Antilles, the island council opted to become a special municipality of the Netherlands, like Saba and Bonaire. This process was completed in October 2010. In 2011 the island officially adopted the US dollar as its currency.

==Geography==
Sint Eustatius is 6 miles (10 km) long and up to 3 miles (5 km) wide. Topographically, the island is saddle-shaped, with the high dormant volcano Quill (Mount Mazinga), (from Dutch &quot;kuil&quot;, meaning &#x27;pit&#x27;—originally referring to its crater) to the southeast and the smaller summits of Signal Hill/Little Mountain (or &quot;Bergje&quot;) and Boven Mountain to the northwest. The Quill crater is a popular tourist attraction on the island. The bulk of the island&#x27;s population lives in the flat saddle between the two elevated areas, which forms the centre of the island.
===Climate===
St. Eustatius has a tropical monsoon climate. Tropical storms and hurricanes are common. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from 1 June to 30 November, sharply peaking from late August through September. Tropical Cyclone Climatology

===Nature===
As St. Eustatius is a volcanic island and very small, all of the beaches on the island are made up of black volcanic sand. These volcanic sands, especially one of the more popular nesting beaches called Zeelandia, are very important nesting sites for several endangered sea turtles such as: the green turtle, leatherback, loggerhead and hawksbill.
Sint Eustatius is home to one of the last remaining populations of the critically endangered Lesser Antillean iguana (&quot;Iguana delicatissima&quot;). The population was strongly affected during the high-intensity hurricane year of 2017, with especially Hurricane Maria, during which the population declined by 25%. 

===National parks===
Sint Eustatius has three nature parks – on land and at sea: the Sint Eustatius National Marine Park, Quill/Boven National Park, and Miriam Schmidt Botanical Garden. Two of them have national park status. These areas have been designated as important bird areas. The nature parks are maintained by the St Eustatius National Parks Foundation (STENAPA).

==Archaeology==
Due to its turbulent history, Sint Eustatius is rich in archaeological sites. Nearly 300 sites have been documented. The island is said to have the highest concentration of archaeological sites of any area of comparable size. In the 1920s, J. P. B. de Josselin de Jong conducted archaeological research into Saladoid sites on the island and in the 1980s a great deal of research at the Golden Rock site was done by archaeologist Aad Versteeg of Leiden University. Around 1981, under the direction of archaeologist Norman F. Barka, the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia also started archaeological research on Sint Eustatius. The documented archaeological sites include prehistoric sites, plantations, military sites, commercial trading sites (including shipwrecks), and urban sites (churches, government buildings, cemeteries, residences). The St. Eustatius Center for Archaeological Research (SECAR) has been conducting archaeological research on the island since 2004 including excavations at the Godet African Burial Ground and the Golden Rock African Burial Ground.

In June 2021, SECAR became involved in protests against excavations at the 18th-century burial ground Golden Rock on the island. The Ubuntu Connected Front and other concerned citizens of Sint Eustatius denounced the non-involvement of the community in the excavation process through a petition and letters to the government. The majority of the population on St. Eustatius are of African descent. Participation in cultural heritage, i.e. involving the community whose ancestors are being excavated, is good practice in contemporary archaeology. Archaeological excavations on St. Eustatius apparently fall under the old Monuments Act for the BES islands that is very brief on these issues. The 2016 Dutch Heritage Act offers more protection for cultural heritage. The Committee on Kingdom Relations asked State Secretary Raymond Knops questions about the matter. The &quot;Statia Heritage and Research Commission&quot; (SHRC) set up by the government of St. Eustatius investigated the allegations of the protest groups and published its report in January 2022.
== Demography ==
=== Population ===
As of January 2024, the population was 3,204, with a population density of 154 inhabitants per square kilometre. 
=== Language ===
The official language is Dutch, but English is the &quot;language of everyday life&quot; on the island and education is solely in English. A local English-based creole is also spoken informally. More than 52% of the population speak more than one language. The most widely spoken languages are English (92.7%), Dutch (36%), Spanish (33.8%) and Papiamento (20.8%).

=== Religion ===
The population of Sint Eustatius is predominantly Christian. The main denominations are Methodism (28.6%), Roman Catholicism (23.7%), Seventh-Day Adventist (17.8%), Pentecostalism (7.2%) and Anglicanism (2.6%).

==Economy==

In the 18th century, &quot;Statia&quot; was the most important Dutch island in the Caribbean and was a center of great wealth from trading. At this time it was known as the &quot;Golden Rock&quot; because of its immense wealth. A very large number of warehouses lined the road that runs along Oranje Bay; most (but not all) of these warehouses are now ruined and some of the ruins are partially underwater.

A French occupation in 1795 was the beginning of the end of great prosperity for Sint Eustatius.

The government is the largest employer on the island, and the oil terminal owned by GTI Statia is the largest private employer.

=== Energy and water ===

Statia Utility Company N.V. provides electricity to the island, as well as drinking water per truck and on part of the island by a water network. The electricity supply is rapidly being made green. Until 2016 all electricity was produced by diesel generators. In March 2016 the first phase of the solar park with 1.89 MWp capacity became operational, covering 23% of entire electricity demand. In November 2017 another 2.15 MWp was added, totaling 14,345 solar panels, with 4.1 MW capacity and a yearly production of 6.4 GWh. The solar park includes lithium-ion batteries of 5.9 MWh size. These provide power for grid stability, as well as energy shifting. On a sunny day the diesel generators are switched off from 9 a.m. to 8 pm. This is made possible by grid-forming inverters produced by SMA. This is one of the first such solar parks in the world and provides 40% to 50% of the island&#x27;s electricity.

==Education==
Dutch government policy towards St. Eustatius and other SSS islands promoted English medium education. Sint Eustatius has bilingual English–Dutch education.

Gwendoline van Putten School (GVP) is a secondary school on the island.

Other schools include: Golden Rock School, Gov. de Graaff School, Methodist School, SDA School.

==Sports==
The most popular sports on Sint Eustatius are football, futsal, softball, basketball, swimming and volleyball. Due to the small population, there are few sport associations. One of them, the Sint Eustatius Volleyball Association, is a member of ECVA and NORCECA. Currently St. Eustatius is a non-active member of the Caribbean zone of Pony Baseball and Softball leagues.

<text>, also known as Shin Buddhism or True Pure Land Buddhism, is a school of Pure Land Buddhism founded by the former Tendai Japanese monk Shinran.

Shin Buddhism is the most widely practiced branch of Buddhism in Japan.

==History==

===Shinran (founder)===
Shinran (1173–1263) lived during the late Heian to early Kamakura period (1185–1333), a time of turmoil for Japan when the emperor was stripped of political power by the &quot;shōguns&quot;. Shinran&#x27;s family had a high rank at the Imperial court in Kyoto, but given the times, many aristocratic families were sending sons off to be Buddhist monks instead of having them participate in the Imperial government. When Shinran was nine years old in 1181, he was sent by his uncle to Mount Hiei, where he was ordained as a śrāmaṇera in the Tendai sect. Over time, Shinran became disillusioned with how Buddhism was practiced, foreseeing a decline in the potency and practicality of the teachings espoused.

Shinran left his role as a &quot;dosō&quot; (&quot;practice-hall monk&quot;) at Mount Hiei and undertook a 100-day retreat at Rokkaku-dō in Kyoto, where he had a dream on the 95th day. In this dream, Prince Shōtoku appeared to him, espousing a pathway to enlightenment through verse. Following the retreat, in 1201, Shinran left Mount Hiei to study under Hōnen for the next six years. Hōnen (1133–1212) another ex-Tendai monk, left the tradition in 1175 to found his own sect, the Jōdo-shū or &quot;Pure Land School&quot;. From that time on, Shinran considered himself, even after exile, a devout disciple of Hōnen rather than a founder establishing his own, distinct Pure Land school.

During this period, Hōnen taught the new nembutsu-only practice to many people in Kyoto society and amassed a substantial following but also came under increasing criticism by the Buddhist establishment there. Among his strongest critics was the monk Myōe and the temples of Enryaku-ji and Kōfuku-ji. The latter continued to criticize Hōnen and his followers even after they pledged to behave with good conduct and to not slander other Buddhists.

In 1207, Hōnen&#x27;s critics at Kōfuku-ji persuaded Emperor Toba II to forbid Hōnen and his teachings after two of Imperial ladies-in-waiting converted to his practices. Hōnen and his followers, among them Shinran, were forced into exile and four of Hōnen&#x27;s disciples were executed. Shinran was given a lay name, &quot;Yoshizane Fujii&quot;, by the authorities but called himself &quot;Gutoku&quot; &quot;Stubble-headed One&quot; instead and moved to Echigo Province (today Niigata Prefecture).

It was during this exile that Shinran cultivated a deeper understanding of his own beliefs based on Hōnen&#x27;s Pure Land teachings. In 1210 he married Eshinni, the daughter of an Echigo aristocrat. Shinran and Eshinni had several children. His eldest son, Zenran, was alleged to have started a heretical sect of Pure Land Buddhism through claims that he received special teachings from his father. Zenran demanded control of local &quot;monto&quot; (lay follower groups), but after writing a stern letter of warning, Shinran disowned him in 1256, effectively ending Zenran&#x27;s legitimacy.

In 1211 the nembutsu ban was lifted and Shinran was pardoned, but by 1212, Hōnen had died in Kyoto. Shinran never saw Hōnen following their exile. In the year of Hōnen&#x27;s death, Shinran set out for the Kantō region, where he established a substantial following and began committing his ideas to writing. In 1224 he wrote his most significant book, the &quot;Kyogyoshinsho&quot; (&quot;The True Teaching, Practice, Faith and Attainment of the Pure Land&quot;), which contained excerpts from the Three Pure Land sutras and the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; along with his own commentaries and the writings of the Jodo Shinshu Patriarchs Shinran drew inspiration from.

In 1234, at the age of sixty, Shinran left Kantō for Kyoto (Eshinni stayed in Echigo and she may have outlived Shinran by several years), where he dedicated the rest of his years to writing. It was during this time he wrote the Wasan, a collection of verses summarizing his teachings for his followers to recite.

Shinran&#x27;s daughter, Kakushinni, came to Kyoto with Shinran, and cared for him in his final years and his mausoleum later became Hongan-ji, &quot;Temple of the Original Vow&quot;. Kakushinni was instrumental in preserving Shinran&#x27;s teachings after his death, and the letters she received and saved from her mother, Eshinni, provide critical biographical information regarding Shinran&#x27;s earlier life. These letters are currently preserved in the Nishi Hongan temple in Kyoto. Shinran died at the age of 90 in 1263 (technically age 89 by Western reckoning).

===Revival and formalization===

Following Shinran&#x27;s death, the lay Shin &quot;monto&quot; slowly spread through the Kantō and the northeastern seaboard. Shinran&#x27;s descendants maintained themselves as caretakers of Shinran&#x27;s gravesite and as Shin teachers, although they continued to be ordained in the Tendai School. Some of Shinran&#x27;s disciples founded their own schools of Shin Buddhism, such as the Bukko-ji and Kosho-ji, in Kyoto. Early Shin Buddhism did not truly flourish until the time of Rennyo (1415–1499), who was 8th in descent from Shinran. Through his charisma and proselytizing, Shin Buddhism was able to amass a greater following and grow in strength. In the 16th-century, during the Sengoku period the political power of Honganji led to several conflicts between it and the warlord Oda Nobunaga, culminating in a ten-year conflict over the location of the Ishiyama Hongan-ji, which Nobunaga coveted because of its strategic value. So strong did the sect become that in 1602, through mandate of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, the main temple Hongan-ji in Kyoto was broken off into two sects to curb its power. These two sects, the Nishi (Western) Honganji and the Higashi (Eastern) Honganji, exist separately to this day.

During the time of Shinran, followers would gather in informal meeting houses called &quot;dojo&quot;, and had an informal liturgical structure. However, as time went on, this lack of cohesion and structure caused Jōdo Shinshū to gradually lose its identity as a distinct sect, as people began mixing other Buddhist practices with Shin ritual. One common example was the Mantra of Light popularized by Myōe and Shingon Buddhism. Other Pure Land Buddhist practices, such as the nembutsu odori or &quot;dancing nembutsu&quot; as practiced by the followers of Ippen and the Ji School, may have also been adopted by early Shin Buddhists. Rennyo ended these practices by formalizing much of the Jōdo Shinshū ritual and liturgy, and revived the thinning community at the Honganji temple while asserting newfound political power. Rennyo also proselytized widely among other Pure Land sects and consolidated most of the smaller Shin sects. Today, there are still ten distinct sects of Jōdo Shinshū with Nishi Hongan-ji and Higashi Hongan-ji being the two largest.

Rennyo is generally credited by Shin Buddhists for reversing the stagnation of the early Jōdo Shinshū community, and is considered the &quot;Second Founder&quot; of Jōdo Shinshū. His portrait picture, along with Shinran&#x27;s, are present on the &quot;onaijin&quot; (altar area) of most Jōdo Shinshū temples. However, Rennyo has also been criticized by some Shin scholars for his engagement in medieval politics and his alleged divergences from Shinran&#x27;s original thought. After Rennyo, Shin Buddhism was still persecuted in some regions. Secret Shin groups called &quot;kakure nenbutsu&quot; would meet in mountain caves to perform chanting and traditional rituals.

Following the unification of Japan during the Edo period, Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism adapted, along with the other Japanese Buddhist schools, into providing memorial and funeral services for its registered members under the Danka system, which was legally required by the Tokugawa shogunate in order to prevent the spread of Christianity in Japan. The &quot;danka seido&quot; system continues to exist today, although not as strictly as in the premodern period, causing Japanese Buddhism to also be labeled as &quot;Funeral Buddhism&quot; since it became the primary function of Buddhist temples. The Honganji also created an impressive academic tradition, which led to the founding of Ryukoku University in Kyoto and formalized many of the Jōdo Shinshū traditions which are still followed today.

Following the Meiji Restoration and the subsequent persecution of Buddhism (&quot;haibutsu kishaku&quot;) of the late 1800s due to a revived nationalism and modernization, Jōdo Shinshū managed to survive intact due to the devotion of its &quot;monto&quot;. During World War II, the Honganji, as with the other Japanese Buddhist schools, was compelled to support the policies of the military government and the cult of State Shinto. It subsequently apologized for its wartime actions.

In contemporary times, Jōdo Shinshū is one of the most widely followed forms of Buddhism in Japan, although like other schools, it faces challenges from many popular Japanese new religions, or &quot;shinshūkyō&quot;, which emerged following World War II as well as from the growing secularization and materialism of Japanese society.

All ten schools of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism commemorated the 750th memorial of their founder, Shinran, in 2011 in Kyoto.

==Doctrine==
Shinran&#x27;s thought was strongly influenced by the doctrine of &quot;Mappō,&quot; a largely Mahayana eschatology which claims humanity&#x27;s ability to listen to and practice the Buddhist teachings deteriorates over time and loses effectiveness in bringing individual practitioners closer to Buddhahood. This belief was particularly widespread in early medieval China and in Japan at the end of the Heian. Shinran, like his mentor Hōnen, saw the age he was living in as being a degenerate one where beings cannot hope to be able to extricate themselves from the cycle of birth and death through their own power, or &quot;jiriki&quot; (自力). For both Hōnen and Shinran, all conscious efforts towards achieving enlightenment and realizing the Bodhisattva ideal were contrived and rooted in selfish ignorance; for humans of this age are so deeply rooted in karmic evil as to be incapable of developing the truly altruistic compassion that is requisite to becoming a Bodhisattva.

Due to his awareness of human limitations, Shinran advocated reliance on &quot;tariki&quot;, or &quot;other power&quot; (他力)—the power of Amitābha (Japanese &quot;Amida&quot;) made manifest in his Primal Vow—in order to attain liberation. Shin Buddhism can therefore be understood as a &quot;practiceless practice&quot;, for there are no specific acts to be performed such as there are in the &quot;Path of Sages&quot;. In Shinran&#x27;s own words, Shin Buddhism is considered the &quot;Easy Path&quot; because one is not compelled to perform many difficult, and often esoteric, practices in order to attain higher and higher mental states.

===Nembutsu===

As in other Pure Land Buddhist schools, Amitābha is a central focus of the Buddhist practice, and Jōdo Shinshū expresses this devotion through a chanting practice called nembutsu, or &quot;Mindfulness of the Buddha [Amida]&quot;. The nembutsu is simply reciting the phrase &quot;Namu Amida Butsu&quot; (&quot;I take refuge in Amitābha Buddha&quot;). Jōdo Shinshū is not the first school of Buddhism to practice the nembutsu but it is interpreted in a new way according to Shinran. The nembutsu becomes understood as an act that expresses gratitude to Amitābha; furthermore, it is evoked in the practitioner through the power of Amida&#x27;s unobstructed compassion. Therefore, in Shin Buddhism, the nembutsu is not considered a practice, nor does it generate karmic merit. It is simply an affirmation of one&#x27;s gratitude. Indeed, given that the nembutsu is the Name, when one utters the Name, that is Amitābha calling to the devotee. This is the essence of the Name-that-calls.

Note that this is in contrast to the related Jōdo-shū, which promoted a combination of repetition of the nembutsu and devotion to Amitābha as a means to birth in his pure land of Sukhavati. It also contrasts with other Buddhist schools in China and Japan, where nembutsu recitation was part of a more elaborate ritual.

===The Pure Land===
In another departure from more traditional Pure Land schools, Shinran advocated that birth in the Pure Land was settled in the midst of life. At the moment one entrusts oneself to Amitābha, one becomes &quot;established in the stage of the truly settled&quot;. This is equivalent to the stage of non-retrogression along the bodhisattva path.

Many Pure Land Buddhist schools in the time of Shinran felt that birth in the Pure Land was a literal rebirth that occurred only upon death, and only after certain preliminary rituals. Elaborate rituals were used to guarantee rebirth in the Pure Land, including a common practice wherein the fingers were tied by strings to a painting or image of Amida Buddha. From the perspective of Jōdo Shinshū such rituals actually betray a lack of trust in Amida Buddha, relying on &quot;jiriki&quot; (&quot;self-power&quot;), rather than the &quot;tariki&quot; or &quot;other-power&quot; of Amida Buddha. Such rituals also favor those who could afford the time and energy to practice them or possess the necessary ritual objects—another obstacle for lower-class individuals. For Shinran Shonin, who closely followed the thought of the Chinese monk Tan-luan, the Pure Land is synonymous with nirvana.

===Shinjin===
The goal of the Shin path, or at least the practicer&#x27;s present life, is the attainment of shinjin in the Other Power of Amida. Shinjin is sometimes translated as &quot;faith&quot;, but this does not capture the nuances of the term and it is more often simply left untranslated. The receipt of shinjin comes about through the renunciation of self-effort in attaining enlightenment through &quot;tariki&quot;. &quot;Shinjin&quot; arises from &quot;jinen&quot; (自然 naturalness, spontaneous working of the Vow) and cannot be achieved solely through conscious effort. One is letting go of conscious effort in a sense, and simply trusting Amida Buddha, and the nembutsu.

For Jōdo Shinshū practitioners, shinjin develops over time through &quot;deep hearing&quot; () of Amitābha&#x27;s call of the nembutsu. According to Shinran, &quot;to hear&quot; means &quot;that sentient beings, having heard how the Buddha&#x27;s Vow arose—its origin and fulfillment—are altogether free of doubt.&quot; &quot;Jinen&quot; also describes the way of naturalness whereby Amitābha&#x27;s infinite light illumines and transforms the deeply rooted karmic evil of countless rebirths into good karma. It is of note that such evil karma is not destroyed but rather transformed: Shin stays within the Mahayana tradition&#x27;s understanding of śūnyatā and understands that samsara and nirvana are not separate. Once the practitioner&#x27;s mind is united with Amitābha and Buddha-nature gifted to the practitioner through shinjin, the practitioner attains the state of non-retrogression, whereupon after his death it is claimed he will achieve instantaneous and effortless enlightenment. He will then return to the world as a Bodhisattva, that he may work towards the salvation of all beings.

==Tannishō==
The &quot;Tannishō&quot; is a 13th-century book of recorded sayings attributed to Shinran, transcribed with commentary by Yuien-bo, a disciple of Shinran. The word &quot;Tannishō&quot; is a phrase which means &quot;A record [of the words of Shinran] set down in lamentation over departures from his [Shinran&#x27;s] teaching&quot;. While it is a short text, it is one of the most popular because practitioners see Shinran in a more informal setting.

For centuries, the text was almost unknown to the majority of Shin Buddhists. In the 15th century, Rennyo, Shinran&#x27;s descendant, wrote of it, &quot;This writing is an important one in our tradition. It should not be indiscriminately shown to anyone who lacks the past karmic good&quot;. Rennyo Shonin&#x27;s personal copy of the &quot;Tannishō&quot; is the earliest extant copy. Kiyozawa Manshi (1863–1903) revitalized interest in the Tannishō, which indirectly helped to bring about the Ohigashi schism of 1962.

==In Japanese culture==
Earlier schools of Buddhism that came to Japan, including Tendai and Shingon Buddhism, gained acceptance because of honji suijaku practices. For example, a kami could be seen as a manifestation of a bodhisattva. It is common even to this day to have Shinto shrines within the grounds of Buddhist temples.

By contrast, Shinran had distanced Jōdo Shinshū from Shinto because he believed that many Shinto practices contradicted the notion of reliance on Amitābha. However, Shinran taught that his followers should still continue to worship and express gratitude to kami, other buddhas, and bodhisattvas despite the fact that Amitābha should be the primary buddha that Pure Land believers focus on. Furthermore, under the influence of Rennyo and other priests, Jōdo Shinshū later fully accepted honji suijaku beliefs and the concept of kami as manifestations of Amida Buddha and other buddhas and bodhisattvas.

Jōdo Shinshū traditionally had an uneasy relationship with other Buddhist schools because it discouraged the majority of traditional Buddhist practices except for the nembutsu. Relations were particularly hostile between the Jōdo Shinshū and Nichiren Buddhism. On the other hand, newer Buddhist schools in Japan, such as Zen, tended to have a more positive relationship and occasionally shared practices, although this is still controversial. In popular lore, Rennyo, the 8th Head Priest of the Hongan-ji sect, was good friends with the famous Zen master Ikkyū.

Jōdo Shinshū drew much of its support from lower social classes in Japan who could not devote the time or education to other esoteric Buddhist practices or merit-making activities.

==Outside Japan==
During the 19th century, Japanese immigrants began arriving in Hawaii, the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America (especially in Brazil). Many immigrants to North America came from regions in which Jōdo Shinshū was predominant, and maintained their religious identity in their new country. The Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii, the Buddhist Churches of America and the Jodo Shinshu Buddhist Temples of Canada (formerly Buddhist Churches of Canada) are several of the oldest Buddhist organizations outside of Asia. Jōdo Shinshū continues to remain relatively unknown outside the ethnic community because of the history of Japanese American and Japanese-Canadian internment during World War II, which caused many Shin temples to focus on rebuilding the Japanese-American Shin sangha rather than encourage outreach to non-Japanese. Today, many Shinshū temples outside Japan continue to have predominantly ethnic Japanese members, although interest in Buddhism and intermarriage contribute to a more diverse community. There are active Jōdo Shinshū sanghas in the United Kingdom, such as Three Wheels Temple.

During Taiwan&#x27;s Japanese colonial era (1895–1945), Jōdo Shinshū built a temple complex in downtown Taipei.

==Shin patriarchs==

The &quot;Seven Patriarchs of Jōdo Shinshū&quot; are seven Buddhist monks venerated in the development of Pure Land Buddhism as summarized in the Jōdo Shinshū hymn &quot;Shoshinge&quot;. Shinran quoted the writings and commentaries of the Patriarchs in his major work, the &quot;Kyogyoshinsho&quot;, to bolster his teachings.

The Seven Patriarchs, in chronological order, and their contributions are:
In Jodo Shinshu temples, the seven masters are usually collectively enshrined on the far left.

<text>In Downtown Atlanta, the Downtown Connector or 75/85 (pronounced &quot;seventy-five eighty-five&quot;) is the concurrent section of Interstate 75 and Interstate 85 through the core of the city. Beginning at the I-85/Langford Parkway interchange, the Downtown Connector runs generally due north, meeting the west–east I-20 in the middle. Just north of this is the Grady Curve around Grady Memorial Hospital. Continuing north, the terminus of the Downtown Connector is the Brookwood Interchange or Brookwood Split in the Brookwood area of the city. The overall length of the Downtown Connector is approximately . Since the 2000s, it has been officially named James Wendell George Parkway for most of its length, although it is still designated the Connector in the mainstream. It also has unsigned designations State Route 401 (I-75) and State Route 403 (I-85) along its length, due to I-75 and I-85 having 400-series reference numbers.

==Route description==

The Downtown Connector carries more than 437,000 vehicles per day at its busiest point — just south of 10th Street in Midtown, while the least traveled portion carries 243,000 vehicles per day — just south of Fulton Street, near the interchange with Interstate 20. The area around the connector and associated interchanges are considered one of the ten-most congested stretches of interstate in the U.S. Due to this fact, many motorists often compare Atlanta to Los Angeles, which is also known for its notoriously-congested freeway system.

The highway is fully instrumented with Intelligent transportation system (ITS) devices. There are more than 25 closed-circuit television cameras between the Langford Parkway interchange (south end) and the Brookwood Interchange (north end). Additionally, the Downtown Connector has three large overhead electronic message signs, and four smaller HOV-dedicated message signs on the median barrier wall. Traffic flow data is gathered through a video detection system, using pole-mounted black-and-white cameras spaced every on both sides of the roadway. All video and data is fed into the GDOT&#x27;s Transportation Management Center (TMC), via fiber-optic cable located under the shoulders of the roadway. Virtually all entrance ramps are metered, with the exception of the freeway-to-freeway connection ramps from I-20. As with every other freeway inside the Perimeter, the Downtown Connector is lined with streetlights mounted in the center median, with high-mast lighting at major interchanges.

Atlanta&#x27;s skyline, both Downtown and Midtown, can be seen from the highway, especially at the northern and southern ends.

==History==
===Planning and initial construction===
On December 14, 1944, the Georgia State Highway Department, the predecessor agency to the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), collaborated with the city of Atlanta, Fulton County, and the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR), the predecessor to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to work on a plan to improve traffic and connectivity within the Atlanta area. Chicago-based H.W. Lochner &amp; Company, a transportation engineering firm which had been formed earlier that year, was hired to provide a comprehensive transportation plan for the region, using data conducted by the BPR and the state highway department from 1936 to 1945, and future growth projections. The report, which was released on January 10, 1946, recommended a total of six radiating expressways be constructed in the city, with the intent of being integrated into what later became the Interstate Highway System, which at the time was expected to eventually be authorized by Congress. The report recommended that four of these expressways converge into a single north-south route through downtown, which was referred to at the time as both the &quot;Downtown Connector&quot; and the &quot;Downtown Connector Expressway&quot;.

Work of the first section of the Downtown Connector, located between Williams Street and the Brookwood Interchance, as well as the approximately stretch of what is now I-85 north to Peachtree Street, began in September 1948, and was dedicated and opened to traffic on September 25, 1951. The stretch from Piedmont Avenue to Williams Street opened on May 5, 1959. Work on a southern stretch of the Connector, a section between University Avenue and Richardson Street, began in March 1955, and was dedicated and opened on July 25, 1957. Construction on the final stretch, the stretch between Richardson Street and Piedmont Avenue, including the interchange with I-20, began on February 26, 1962, and was opened to traffic on September 18, 1964. A ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Downtown Connector, attended by Governor Carl Sanders, FHWA administrator Rex Marion Whitton, and Atlanta mayor Ivan Allen Jr. was held inside the Georgia State Capitol on October 15, 1964.

Initial construction of the highway displaced parts of Techwood Drive and Williams Street in Midtown Atlanta. It also destroyed street grids east and south of downtown, dividing Sweet Auburn in two and the interchange with I-20 leveling the northern part of the Washington-Rawson district. The proposed I-485 was originally planned by the Georgia Department of Transportation to carry some south–north traffic through the eastern side of the city, but most of this was canceled in the 1970s by the then-governor of Georgia, Jimmy Carter. Parts of that road are now I-675 and SR 400.

===Reconstruction===
The highway was heavily reconstructed during the 1980s as part of GDOT&#x27;s Freeing the Freeways program to widen Atlanta-area freeways, with most of the Connector&#x27;s width being doubled from three to six or seven lanes in each direction. The project included work to increase lanes from six to eight on I-20, I-75, I-85, and I-285 (&quot;The Perimeter&quot;), as well as ten lanes on the downtown connector, involving 126 total miles and was phased over 13 years between 1976 and 1988. The improvement campaign also included elimination of sharp curves and grades, left-hand exits, excessive interchanges, and short acceleration/deceleration lanes.

So as to offer a bypass around construction through the center of the city, the perimeter road (I-285) was completed first. The radiating expressways were then upgraded, and the last phase was reconstruction of the depressed sections through downtown Atlanta. By June 1983, some $252 million in discretionary funds had been used to complete most of the highways save for some major interchanges and the downtown section. The eight miles of the downtown section, which includes the 4.4-mile long downtown connector, was the most complicated section of the entire reconstruction. Work was started on it in 1984, and it included redesigning the massive interchange between I-20 and I-75/85 at Memorial Drive where much of the mileage was on structure. The downtown connector was to be widened to ten lanes, and this required quite a bit of right of way acquisition. Many bridges, including the 55 over the connector portion alone, had to be designed and built. In addition to the general-purpose lanes, provisions for high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and dedicated on-ramps at Williams Street, Piedmont Avenue, and Memorial Drive were built, and were subsequently converted to HOV usage in 1996.

===Later history===
Between 2000 and 2004, the six-lane wide 17th Street Bridge was constructed over the Brookwood Interchange, connecting Midtown Atlanta with the then-new Atlantic Station development. In 2008, reconstruction of the 14th Street Bridge took place in order to accommodate increased traffic flow and pedestrian amenities. This work also included the construction of two new off-ramps: a southbound ramp to 10th Street, and a northbound ramp to 17th Street. This work was completed on May 28, 2010.

In early January 2010, a section of the highway between 14th and 17th streets developed an unusual problem dubbed &quot;phantom ice&quot; during a prolonged cold wave that kept temperatures below freezing for several days in the Atlanta region. GDOT engineers believe that heavy rain in previous months raised the water table and caused it to seep upward through joints between lanes, where it subsequently froze. Commuter traffic was stopped briefly on at least two days in order to treat it with deicing materials and inspect the freeway to determine the cause.

In January 2016, GDOT started a study of the Downtown Connector. Citing high levels of congestion that occur outside of peak periods, the purpose of the study is to gather data and explore options for reducing congestion. Data collection took place all year in 2016, and the data is being analyzed and options evaluated throughout 2017 and 2018. The study is expected to be completed in 2019. The study has already released their data on their website, including nine &quot;Hot Spots&quot;, or dangerous and congested points that could most benefit from design improvements, and a detailed analysis of traffic in the whole metro area and how it relates to traffic on the Downtown Connector.

=== The Stitch ===
The Stitch is a proposed engineering project that would see portions of the Downtown Connector capped and covered with public greenspaces. In August 2016, Central Atlanta Progress (CAP) announced plans to cover the Downtown Connector, converting it to a subterranean roadway and building a series of greenspaces on top of the road to cover an area of approximately , similar to Klyde Warren Park in Dallas. The proposal was first put forward by CAP as a way to reclaim land area taken by the Downtown Connector.

Similar discussions had been held at CAP as early as 2003 and have included similar proposals for the area near the Georgia State Capitol.

This project was drafted by Jacobs Engineering Group and is called &quot;The Stitch&quot;, as one of the intents of the project would be to &quot;stitch&quot; together roads that had been divided with the creation of the Downtown Connector. The study, prepared for CAP by Jacobs Engineering Group at a cost of $100,000, called for a stretch of reclaimed land covering a stretch of the Downtown Connector from Spring Street to Piedmont Avenue in downtown. The study, which compared the project to the Klyde Warren Park in Dallas, said the project would cost approximately $300 million and stimulate approximately $1.1 billion in land development and increased property value. Unlike Klyde Warren Park, The Stitch would involve the creation of multiple parks. The reclaimed land would also allow for the reconnection of Atlanta&#x27;s street grid, which was interrupted by the construction of the Connector.

Between 2017 and 2018, CAP conducted a year-long viability study on the project that involved Jacobs and John Portman and Associates. In March 2019, the Urban Land Institute (ULI) published a feasibility study on the project, while that same month the estimated cost for the project was stated at $452 million. Advisors from the ULI estimated that the project could take four years of planning and pre-development and six years of construction.

As of 2019, the project was still in the pre-construction phase, with an estimated timeline and budget of ten years and $452 million, respectively.

In 2021, the Midtown Connector Project (MCP) Foundation released a proposal to build a park over 10 blocks of the Midtown portion of the Downtown Connector from North Avenue to 10th Street. The proposal connects that area of the city to the main campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, which is located on the other side of the Interstate.

<doc id="293942" wikidata="Q205289" url="?curid=293942" title="Louis V of France">
<text>Louis V ( – 22 May 987), also known as Louis the Do-Nothing (), was a king of West Francia from 979 (co-reigning first with his father Lothair until 986) to his early death in 987. During his reign, the nobility essentially ruled the country. Dying childless, Louis V was the last Carolingian monarch in West Francia.

==Youth==
Louis was born . He was the eldest son of King Lothair of France, the Carolingian ruler of France, and Queen Emma, daughter of King Lothair II of Italy and Empress Adelaide. Louis was associated to the government by his father in 978 and crowned co-king on 8 June 979 at the Abbey of Saint-Corneille in Compiègne by Archbishop Adalbero of Reims.

==Marriage==
In 982 at Vieille-Brioude, Haute-Loire, the fifteen-year-old Louis was married to the forty-year-old Adelaide-Blanche of Anjou, sister of Count Geoffrey I and twice a widow from her previous marriages with Count Stephen of Gévaudan and Count Raymond of Toulouse, Prince of Gothia. This union was purely political and arranged by the king – following the advice of Queen Emma and Count Geoffrey I – with the double purpose of restoring the Carolingian royal power in the south of the kingdom, and (according to Richerus) to obtain the support of the local southern lords in his fight against the Robertians. Being related by marriage to two of the most powerful southern comital families of the Kingdom, Lothair believed that he could confront the power of Hugh Capet.

Immediately after their wedding, Louis and Adelaide-Blanche were crowned king and queen of Aquitaine by Adelaide&#x27;s brother Bishop Guy of Le Puy. From the very beginning, however, the mismatched couple was unable to live peacefully together, not only due to the notorious age difference between them, but (according to Richerus) also because of Louis&#x27; reported affairs:

::[...] They had almost no conjugal love; because Louis had barely reached puberty, and Adelaide was old, there was only incompatibility and disagreements between them. They did not share a common bedroom as they could not bear it; when they had to travel, each took a separate residence, and when they were forced to talk, their conversations were in the open air and were never long, but only lasted for a few words. They lived in this way for two years, until they obtained the divorce for their opposite characters. [...] Louis, who did not have a tutor, indulged himself in all sorts of frivolity due to his young age.

In 984, after two years of childless union (and according to Rodulfus Glaber), Adelaide tricked her young husband into making a visit to Aquitaine, and once there, she left him and returned to her family, marrying shortly thereafter Count William I of Provence:

::When the young prince reached adolescence, Lothair made him king and appointed him his successor; he also chose for him a princess of Aquitaine as his wife, but soon she perceived that the young man would not inherit the talents of his father. Therefore she decided to separate from her husband; and for this purpose she adroitly convinced him to make a trip to her province of Aquitaine, assuming that her hereditary rights there guaranteed her the possession of the land. Louis, without suspecting the artifice, yielded to the advice of his wife, and went with her. When they were in Aquitaine, she left her husband to join her family.

However, despite being recorded by relative contemporary and later sources (Richerus, Rodulfus Glaber, the &quot;Chronicon Andegavensi&quot; and the Chronicle of Saint-Maxence, among others), the existence of this marriage was recently challenged by historian Carlrichard Brülh.

==Reign==

Upon his father&#x27;s death on 2 March 986, the already-crowned Louis V became the undisputed king of the Franks. At that time, however, there existed in the Frankish court two factions: one led by Archbishop Adalberon of Reims and Queen Emma, who, being strongly influenced by her mother Empress Adelaide, wanted the renewal of friendly relationships with the Ottonian dynasty; the other faction wanted to continue Lothair&#x27;s policy, and taking advantage of the minority of Emperor Otto III, wanted a policy of expansion to the east and the recovery of Lotharingia. In addition, the young monarch inherited a battle between his father&#x27;s line of elected kings (which had been interrupted twice by Robertians and once by the Bosonids), and the Ottonian house of Emperor Otto I. As defender of Rome, Otto I had the power to name the clergy in Carolingian territory, and the clergy he had named were not supporting the Carolingians.

Initially, Queen Emma dominated the situation, but in the summer of 986 there was a reversal: the Anti-Ottonian party prevailed, after which she was forced to leave court and seek refuge with Hugh Capet. This event also put Adalberon in a predicament: having been elevated by Otto I to the powerful Archbishopric of Reims, he was forced to leave his episcopal seat and took refuge in one of his fortresses on the Meuse river, which belonged to the Ottonian sphere. The escape of the archbishop was perceived by Louis V as treason; he turned violently against Adalberon and threatened him with a siege of Reims. The matter was finally settled in a trial court at Compiègne. Before this meeting, however, Louis V changed his mind and sought a reconciliation with Adalberon, and so in the spring of 987, he planned a peace meeting with Empress Theophanu, who acted on behalf of her son Otto III. Before all these tangled events were resolved, Louis V died on 22 May 987 from a fall while hunting in the Forest of Halatte near the town of Senlis, Oise. He was buried in the Abbey of Saint-Corneille in Compiègne.

Louis V left no legitimate heirs, so his uncle Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine, was nominated as the hereditary successor to the throne. But the clergy, including both Adalberon and Gerbert (who later became Pope Sylvester II), argued eloquently for the election of Hugh Capet, who was not only of royal blood but had proven himself through his actions and his military might. Hugh was elected to the Frankish throne and Adalberon crowned him, all within two months of Louis V&#x27;s death. Thus the rule of the Carolingian dynasty ended and the Capetian era had begun.

<text>A grandfather clause, also known as grandfather policy, grandfathering, or being grandfathered in, is a provision in which an old rule continues to apply to some existing situations while a new rule will apply to all future cases. Those exempt from the new rule are said to have grandfather rights or acquired rights, or to have been grandfathered in. Frequently, the exemption is limited, as it may extend for a set time, or it may be lost under certain circumstances; for example, a grandfathered power plant might be exempt from new, more restrictive pollution laws, but the exception may be revoked and the new rules would apply if the plant were expanded. Often, such a provision is used as a compromise or out of practicality, to allow new rules to be enacted without upsetting a well-established logistical or political situation. This extends the idea of a rule not being retroactively applied.

==Origin==

=== Southern United States ===
The term originated in late 19th-century legislation and constitutional amendments passed by a number of Southern U.S. states, which created new requirements for literacy tests, payment of poll taxes and residency and property restrictions to register to vote. States in some cases exempted those whose ancestors (e.g., grandfathers) had the right to vote before the American Civil War or as of a particular date from such requirements. The intent and effect of such rules was to prevent former African-American slaves and their descendants from voting but without denying poor and illiterate whites the right to vote. Although these original grandfather clauses were eventually ruled unconstitutional, the terms &quot;grandfather clause&quot; and &quot;grandfather&quot; have been adapted to other uses.

The original grandfather clauses were contained in new state constitutions and Jim Crow laws passed between 1890 and 1908 by white-dominated state legislatures including Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Virginia. They restricted voter registration, effectively preventing African Americans from voting. Racial restrictions on voting in place before 1870 were invalidated by the Fifteenth Amendment.

After Democrats took control of state legislatures again, especially after the Compromise of 1877, they began to work to restrict the ability of black people to vote. Paramilitary groups such as the White League, Red Shirts, and rifle clubs had intimidated black people or barred them from the polls in numerous elections before what they called the Redemption (restoration of white supremacy). Nonetheless, a coalition of Populists and Republicans in fusion tickets in the 1880s and 1890s gained some seats and won some governor positions. To prevent such coalitions in the future, the Democrats wanted to exclude freedmen and other black people from voting; in some states they also restricted poor whites to avoid biracial coalitions.

White Democrats developed statutes and passed new constitutions creating restrictive voter registration rules. Examples included imposition of poll taxes and residency and literacy tests. An exemption to such requirements was made for all persons allowed to vote before the American Civil War, and any of their descendants. The term &quot;grandfather clause&quot; arose from the fact that the laws tied the then-current generation&#x27;s voting rights to those of their grandfathers. According to Black&#x27;s &quot;Law Dictionary&quot;, some Southern states adopted constitutional provisions exempting from the literacy requirements descendants of those who fought in the army or navy of the United States or of the Confederate States during a time of war.

After the U.S. Supreme Court found such provisions unconstitutional in &quot;Guinn v. United States&quot; (1915), states were forced to stop using the grandfather clauses to provide exemption to literacy tests. Without the grandfather clauses, tens of thousands of poor Southern whites were disenfranchised in the early 20th century. As decades passed, Southern states tended to expand the franchise for poor whites, but most black people could not vote until after passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Ratification in 1964 of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited the use of poll taxes in federal elections, but some states continued to use them in state elections.

The 1965 Voting Rights Act had provisions to protect voter registration and access to elections, with federal enforcement and supervision where necessary. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections&quot; that poll taxes could not be used in any elections. This secured the franchise for most citizens, and voter registration and turnout climbed dramatically in Southern states.

=== Other contexts ===
There is also a rather different, older type of &quot;grandfather clause&quot;, perhaps more properly a &quot;grandfather principle&quot; in which a government blots out transactions of the recent past, usually those of a predecessor government. The modern analogue may be repudiating public debt, but the original was Henry II&#x27;s principle, preserved in many of his judgments, &quot;Let it be as it was on the day of my grandfather&#x27;s death&quot;, a principle by which he repudiated all the royal grants that had been made in the previous 19 years under King Stephen.

<text>Amoghavajra ( ; , 705–774) was a prolific translator who became one of the most politically powerful Buddhist monks in Chinese history and is acknowledged as one of the Eight Patriarchs of the Doctrine in Shingon Buddhism.

==Life==
There are differing views as to where Amoghavajra&#x27;s origins were from.
Zhao Qian states that Amoghavajra was born in Samarkand of an Indian merchant or Brahmin father as according to Feixis&#x27;s Stele Inscription and a mother of Sogdian origin. Yan Ying referred to Amoghavajra simply as being &quot;a person of the Western Regions&quot;. Alternatively, Quan Deyu&#x27;s image hall stele inscription states that Amoghavajra was from Sri Lanka. Yuanzhao also repeats the claim that Amoghavajra was from Sri Lanka.

Amoghavajra went to China at age ten after his father&#x27;s death. In 719, he was ordained into the sangha by Vajrabodhi and became his disciple. After all foreign monks were expelled from China in 741, he and some associates went on a pilgrimage to gather texts, visiting Sri Lanka, Indochina and India. During this voyage, he apparently met Nagabodhi, Vajrabodhi&#x27;s master, and studied the Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra at length. He returned to China in 746 with some five hundred volumes gathered from Sri Lanka. 

In 750, he left the court to join the military governorship of General Geshu Han of the Tang dynasty, for whom he conducted large-scale tantric initiations at his field headquarters. In 754, he translated the first portion of the Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra texts (Taishō Tripiṭaka. 865), central to the Outer Tantras of Vajrayana Buddhism, which became one of his most significant accomplishments. He regarded its teachings as the most effective method for attaining enlightenment yet devised, and incorporated its basic schema in several writings.

Amoghavajra was captured during the An Lushan Rebellion but in 757 was freed by loyalist forces, whereupon he performed rites to purify the capital and consolidate the security of the Tang state. Two years later, he initiated the emperor Emperor Suzong of Tang as a chakravartin. 

Amoghavajra assisted the Tang dynasty state against the An Lushan rebellion. He carried out Vajrayana rituals which were ostensibly effective in supernaturally attacking and destroying An Lushan&#x27;s army including the death of one of An Lushan&#x27;s generals, Zhou Zhiguang.

In 765, Amoghavajra used his new rendition of the Humane King Sutra in an elaborate ritual to counter the advance of a 200,000-strong army of Tibetan and Uyghurs which was poised to invade Chang&#x27;an. Its leader, Pugu Huai&#x27;en, dropped dead in camp and his forces dispersed.

The opulent Jinge Temple on Mount Wutai was completed in 767, a pet project of Amoghavajra, one of his many efforts to promote the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī as the protector of China. Amoghavajra continued to perform rites to avert disaster at the request of Emperor Daizong of Tang.

On his death in 774, three days of mourning were officially declared, and he posthumously received various exalted titles. The Chinese monks Huilang, Huiguo and Huilin were among his most prominent successors. Seventy-seven texts were translated by Amoghavajra according to his own account, though many more, including original compositions, are ascribed to him in the Chinese canons.

<text>In mathematics, particularly in set theory, the aleph numbers are a sequence of numbers used to represent the cardinality (or size) of infinite sets. They were introduced by the mathematician Georg Cantor and are named after the symbol he used to denote them, the Hebrew letter aleph (ℵ).

The smallest cardinality of an infinite set is that of the natural numbers, denoted by formula_1 (read &quot;aleph-nought&quot;, &quot;aleph-zero&quot;, or &quot;aleph-null&quot;); the next larger cardinality of a well-ordered set is formula_2, then formula_3 and so on. Continuing in this manner, it is possible to define an infinite cardinal number formula_4 for every ordinal number formula_5, as described below.

The concept and notation are due to Georg Cantor,
who defined the notion of cardinality and realized that infinite sets can have different cardinalities.

The aleph numbers differ from the infinity (formula_6) commonly found in algebra and calculus, in that the alephs measure the sizes of sets, while infinity is commonly defined either as an extreme limit of the real number line (applied to a function or sequence that &quot;diverges to infinity&quot; or &quot;increases without bound&quot;), or as an extreme point of the extended real number line.

==Aleph-zero==
formula_1 (aleph-nought, aleph-zero, or aleph-null) is the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers, and is an infinite cardinal. The set of all finite ordinals, called formula_8 or formula_9 (where formula_8 is the lowercase Greek letter omega), also has cardinality formula_1. A set has cardinality formula_1 if and only if it is countably infinite, that is, there is a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between it and the natural numbers. Examples of such sets are

* the set of natural numbers, irrespective of including or excluding zero,
* the set of all integers, 
* any infinite subset of the integers, such as the set of all square numbers or the set of all prime numbers,
* the set of all rational numbers, 
* the set of all constructible numbers (in the geometric sense),
* the set of all algebraic numbers, 
* the set of all computable numbers, 
* the set of all computable functions, 
* the set of all binary strings of finite length, and 
* the set of all finite subsets of any given countably infinite set.

Among the countably infinite sets are certain infinite ordinals, including for example formula_8, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, and formula_18. For example, the sequence (with order type formula_15) of all positive odd integers followed by all positive even integers formula_20 is an ordering of the set (with cardinality formula_1) of positive integers.

If the axiom of countable choice (a weaker version of the axiom of choice) holds, then formula_1 is smaller than any other infinite cardinal, and is therefore the (unique) least infinite ordinal.

==Aleph-one==
formula_2 is the cardinality of the set of all countable ordinal numbers. This set is denoted by formula_24 (or sometimes Ω). The set formula_24 is itself an ordinal number larger than all countable ones, so it is an uncountable set. Therefore, formula_2 is distinct from formula_1. The definition of formula_2 implies (in ZF, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory &quot;without&quot; the axiom of choice) that no cardinal number is between formula_1 and formula_2. If the axiom of choice is used, it can be further proved that the class of cardinal numbers is totally ordered, and thus formula_2 is the second-smallest infinite cardinal number. One can show one of the most useful properties of the set formula_24: Any countable subset of formula_24 has an upper bound in formula_24 (this follows from the fact that the union of a countable number of countable sets is itself countable). This fact is analogous to the situation in formula_1: Every finite set of natural numbers has a maximum which is also a natural number, and finite unions of finite sets are finite.

An example application of the ordinal formula_24 is &quot;closing&quot; with respect to countable operations; e.g., trying to explicitly describe the σ-algebra generated by an arbitrary collection of subsets (see e.g. Borel hierarchy). This is harder than most explicit descriptions of &quot;generation&quot; in algebra (vector spaces, groups, etc.) because in those cases we only have to close with respect to finite operations – sums, products, etc. The process involves defining, for each countable ordinal, via transfinite induction, a set by &quot;throwing in&quot; all possible &quot;countable&quot; unions and complements, and taking the union of all that over all of formula_24.

==Continuum hypothesis==
The cardinality of the set of real numbers (cardinality of the continuum) is 2formula_1. It cannot be determined from ZFC (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory augmented with the axiom of choice) where this number fits exactly in the aleph number hierarchy, but it follows from ZFC that the continuum hypothesis (CH) is equivalent to the identity
:2formula_1 = formula_2.

The CH states that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers. CH is independent of ZFC: It can be neither proven nor disproven within the context of that axiom system (provided that ZFC is consistent). That CH is consistent with ZFC was demonstrated by Kurt Gödel in 1940, when he showed that its negation is not a theorem of ZFC. That it is independent of ZFC was demonstrated by Paul Cohen in 1963, when he showed conversely that the CH itself is not a theorem of ZFC – by the (then-novel) method of forcing.

==Aleph-omega==
Aleph-omega is formula_41 where the smallest infinite ordinal is denoted as formula_8. That is, the cardinal number formula_43 is the least upper bound of formula_44.

Notably, formula_43 is the first uncountable cardinal number that can be demonstrated within Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory &quot;not&quot; to be equal to the cardinality of the set of all real numbers formula_46: For any natural number formula_47, we can consistently assume that formula_48, and moreover it is possible to assume that formula_46 is as least as large as any cardinal number we like. The main restriction ZFC puts on the value of formula_46 is that it cannot equal certain special cardinals with cofinality formula_1. An uncountably infinite cardinal formula_52 having cofinality formula_1 means that there is a (countable-length) sequence formula_54 of cardinals formula_55 whose limit (i.e. its least upper bound) is formula_52 (see Easton&#x27;s theorem). As per the definition above, formula_43 is the limit of a countable-length sequence of smaller cardinals.

==Aleph-&quot;α&quot; for general &quot;α&quot;==
To define formula_58 for arbitrary ordinal number formula_5, we must define the successor cardinal operation, which assigns to any cardinal number formula_60 the next larger well-ordered cardinal formula_61 (if the axiom of choice holds, this is the (unique) next larger cardinal).

We can then define the aleph numbers as follows:

:formula_62
:formula_63
:formula_64 for formula_65 an infinite limit ordinal,

The formula_5-th infinite initial ordinal is written formula_67. Its cardinality is written formula_58.

Informally, the aleph function formula_69 is a bijection from the ordinals to the infinite cardinals.
Formally, in ZFC, formula_70 is &quot;not a function&quot;, but a function-like class, as it is not a set (due to the Burali-Forti paradox).

==Fixed points of omega==
For any ordinal formula_5 we have formula_72.

In many cases formula_67 is strictly greater than &quot;α&quot;. For example, it is true for any successor ordinal: formula_74 holds. There are, however, some limit ordinals which are fixed points of the omega function, because of the fixed-point lemma for normal functions. The first such is the limit of the sequence

:formula_75

which is sometimes denoted formula_76.

Any weakly inaccessible cardinal is also a fixed point of the aleph function. This can be shown in ZFC as follows. Suppose formula_77 is a weakly inaccessible cardinal. If formula_65 were a successor ordinal, then formula_79 would be a successor cardinal and hence not weakly inaccessible. If formula_65 were a limit ordinal less than formula_52 then its cofinality (and thus the cofinality of formula_82) would be less than formula_52 and so formula_52 would not be regular and thus not weakly inaccessible. Thus formula_85 and consequently formula_86 which makes it a fixed point.

==Role of axiom of choice==
The cardinality of any infinite ordinal number is an aleph number. Every aleph is the cardinality of some ordinal. The least of these is its initial ordinal. Any set whose cardinality is an aleph is equinumerous with an ordinal and is thus well-orderable.

Each finite set is well-orderable, but does not have an aleph as its cardinality.

Over ZF, the assumption that the cardinality of each infinite set is an aleph number is equivalent to the existence of a well-ordering of every set, which in turn is equivalent to the axiom of choice. ZFC set theory, which includes the axiom of choice, implies that every infinite set has an aleph number as its cardinality (i.e. is equinumerous with its initial ordinal), and thus the initial ordinals of the aleph numbers serve as a class of representatives for all possible infinite cardinal numbers.

When cardinality is studied in ZF without the axiom of choice, it is no longer possible to prove that each infinite set has some aleph number as its cardinality; the sets whose cardinality is an aleph number are exactly the infinite sets that can be well-ordered. The method of Scott&#x27;s trick is sometimes used as an alternative way to construct representatives for cardinal numbers in the setting of ZF. For example, one can define formula_87 to be the set of sets with the same cardinality as formula_88 of minimum possible rank. This has the property that formula_89 if and only if formula_88 and formula_91 have the same cardinality. (The set formula_87 does not have the same cardinality of formula_88 in general, but all its elements do.)

<text>Pico Island (&quot;Ilha do Pico,&quot; ) is an island in the Central Group of the Portuguese Azores. The landscape features an eponymous volcano, Ponta do Pico, which is the highest mountain in Portugal, the Azores, and the highest elevation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In the tradition of the Portuguese poet, Raul Brandão, Pico is referred to as the Ilha Preta (&quot;Black Island&quot;), for its black volcanic soils, which nourish its UNESCO-designated vineyards that once allowed the development of the island&#x27;s economy. Pico is the second largest and, geologically speaking, the most recently formed island of the Azores, being around 300,000 years old.

==History==


The exact date of the island&#x27;s discovery is not known. However, in the 1375 Catalan Atlas, Pico is depicted along several other islands of the Azores, where it is labelled as &quot;li colunbj&quot;. In Cristoforo Soligo&#x27;s map from 1475, Pico is described both as Dom Diniz (or São Diniz) island and as &quot;Insula Columbi&quot;.

Although the Azores were inhabited since 1439, settlement on Pico only started in the 1480s when Pico became part of the neighboring island of Faial&#x27;s control. Pico is thought to be the last of the islands of the Central Group to be occupied.

In a letter dated March 28, 1481, the administrator of the Azores, D. Beatriz, gave the possession of the island of Pico to the first captain of the donatarie, D. Álvaro d&#x27;Ornelas, a resident of island of Madeira, on the condition that he populate the island (&#x27;Captains&#x27;, often of noble heritage, obtained land rights in regions not important enough to merit a &#x27;governor&#x27;, and were a cheap way for the state to settle new territory). d&#x27;Ornelas failed to attract settlers, so on December 29, 1482, the Flemish captain of the island of Faial, 7 km from Pico, Jós d&#x27;Hutra, became the new captain. The transfer of the island of Pico to Jós d&#x27;Hutra not only confirms that Pico was not colonized at the end of the 15th century, but also demonstrates the interest in boosting the insular population of the islands of the central group. This was understandable given the growing geo-economic importance of the Azores archipelago at that time, as the Portuguese monarchy was expanding into Morocco and along the west African coast.

Population grew slowly, in part because of difficulties cultivating wheat. By 1587, there were less than 3,000 inhabitants. Soil quality is conditioned by the volcanic soils consisting mostly of lightly weathered recent basalt (designated as &quot;biscoitos&quot; or &quot;mistérios&quot;). Examples include the Mistério de São João, resulting from a 1718 eruption. In addition, there are few rivers on the island compared to other parts of the archipelago. The last eruptions of magma took place in 1718 and 1720 and generated three volcanic cinder cones (&quot;Mistérios&quot;): Santa Luzia and São João in 1718 and Silveira in 1720.

Aside from a few slaves sent to herd sheep in isolation before European settlement, the island&#x27;s first inhabitants were primarily Portuguese, but of diverse origins. Settlers of Portuguese origin arrived from different parts of the metropolis, some passing though Madeira Island or other Azorean islands, particularly Terceira. Some inhabitants had noble origins, owning land and goods; there were secular and regular clergy, especially the Franciscans; and another group consisted of merchants, craftsmen, farmers and artisans. A small number of Jews came from the beginning of the 16th century, and there were indentured slaves of African origin at this time who farmed and did domestic work. The first municipality in Pico was established at Lajes, where fresh water was available (the place-name (Ribeiras) proves this).

Around 9,000 lived on Pico by 1695. Pico moved &quot;up the ladder&quot; of urban hierarchies from fifth largest centre in the Azores to fourth, behind São Miguel, Terceira and Faial. By the middle of the 18th century the population was over 19,000 people. In 1542, the inhabitants of the north of the island asked King João III to create a second village, to allow better law and order in a frontier economy with theft and corruption. São Roque do Pico was established. It was only much later, when the link between the islands of Pico and Faial strengthened further, that there was a need to create a third municipality; Madalena was established in 1723 (the larger town of Horta is 7 km away on Faial, and was where many of the island&#x27;s property-owners and winemakers lived).

The islands of Pico and Faial were administered jointly until 1766, when Pico became an integral part of the Province of the Azores, led by a captain-general based in Angra. Centralizing governance in this way had poor success: in 1836, the people of Pico were integrated into a smaller administrative unit again, the third Azorean district, with the islands of Faial, Flores and Corvo.

Settlers initially farmed wheat and some olives in addition to developing a woad industry, as on Faial (based on lichens that were exported to Flanders to produce commercial dyes). The two islands often shared livelihood activities Viticulture, helped by the richer soils found in suitable micro-climates, then grew rapidly. The industry was disturbed by the last volcanic eruptions, but viticulture expanded commercial livelihood opportunities considerably. Pico&#x27;s famous &quot;verdelho&quot; wine production, dating back two centuries, was widely appreciated in many countries (including England and in the Americas and even in the palaces of the Russian czars). Viticulture declined with the spread of powdery mildew and phylloxera during the middle of the 19th century, creating a crisis on the island that lasted until the 20th century.

The other major economic activity was whaling. The presence of American and British whalers in the waters of the Azores at the end of the 18th century stabilized the economy. Spermwhale hunting became the primary industry around the island until it was abolished in 1986. The whale factory is now a museum.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===

The island is 17.5 km south of São Jorge and just 7 km east of Faial, in the Central Group of islands, an area that is colloquially known as O Triângulo (The Triangle). Pico is 46.3 kilometers long, and at its maximum extent about 16 kilometers wide; making it the second largest of the Azores islands. The 151.8 km coastline is slightly indented with inlets and coves. Accessibility to the sea poses no difficulties, except in sections with plunging, unstable cliffs, subject to frequent landslides (as seen in the northeast and southeast). Seabirds find favorable conditions for nesting in these habitats, in particular the species of Tern (&quot;Sterna hirundo&quot; and &quot;Sterna dougallii&quot;) and Shearwater (&quot;Calonectris borealis&quot;). The rocky substrates prevail throughout the coast (slabs that alternate with rolled pebbles), there are no sandy beaches, but there are numerous tide pools and natural inlets used for bathing.

Along the central plain of volcano cones to the eastern coast, the landscape is pitted with the remnants of craters and lake-filled cones, and dominated by the ancient volcano of Topo. Geomorphologically, the island is composed of three units:
* Topo Volcano - Located on the southernmost side of the island, it corresponds to an ancient shield volcano created by the overlap of various lava flows and destroyed by erosion and landslides;
* Achada Plateau - Extending from the east side of the island to the stratovolcano, the Achada Plateau is an axial zone comprising spatter and lava cones along a mountainous ridge filled with lake-filled craters, dense scrub and forests. Cones in this region are oriented along a west-northwest and south-southeast axis along a path east to west between the other volcanic structures;
* Pico Volcano - It occupies the western portion of the island, and corresponds to a central volcano with in altitude, created by numerous Hawaiian and Strombolian eruptions. Along its flanks are diverse lava and spatter cones that are formed along radial fractures and faults.

Pico Island&#x27;s tectonic structures are generally oriented along a west-northwest to east-southeast and a northeast to southwest axis. The main axis controls the main structures, especially the main mountain of Pico, while the secondary axises affect the radial fractures and faults along the central plain and eastern volcano.

Similar to the geomorphological structures described above, the volcanic landforms have been identified by Madeira (1998) in the following units:

* Volcanic Complex of Lajes - pertains to the oldest volcanic structures, comprising volcanoes, lavas and debris that are between 35 and 300,000 thousand years old; it makes up the structures of the eastern part of the island, including the ancient volcano of Topo.
* Volcanic Complex of Calheta de Nesquim - dating to about 230,000 thousand years ago, this is a fissural zone of cones and basaltic lavas, associated with the Achada Plain, and the many faults along the central plateau of the island.
* Volcanic Complex of Madalena - the most recent volcanic complex, with both geological and historical eruptions; it includes the basaltic stratovolcano of Pico, but also many of the cones, faults and lava fields that circle the 2,351 meter summit.

The last volcanic eruption (which is debatable) occurred in 1963, in a small submarine eruption off the northwest coast (north of Cachorro in Santa Luzia). Prior to this, major volcanic activity was evident in lava fields generated in only the areas of Prainha (1562–64), Santa Luzia (1718), São João (1718) and Silveira (1720). The paths of the lava flows are still visible; those in the 16th century and 1718 were particularly substantial, extending for over 10 km. Today, the only visible evidence of active volcanism appears on the summit of Pico, in the base and interior of the Piqueninho (the mini-peak on the summit); there are irregular emissions from cracks in this zone. Additionally, there are emissions on the eastern flanks between 1500 and 2000 meters altitude. There have also been found areas of de-gasification along the fault associated with the Lagoa do Capitão and another in the Topo Volcano, as well as a spring rich in in the area of Silveira.

===Earthquakes===
Pico, much like the other islands, is susceptible to seismic events, although their epicenters have primarily been localized in the Faial-Pico or Pico-São Jorge Channels. Only three significant tectonic earthquakes have hit the island of Pico since the beginning of settlement: The 1757 earthquake, which caused significant damage in the eastern region of the island including the death of 11 people and the collapse of a church and a few houses; the 1973 seismic crisis (October 1973 – May 1974) in which the main earthquake (with magnitude 5.5) did considerable damage to 604 houses in Faial and 2,000 in Pico, which left nearly 5,000 people homeless; and the July 9, 1998 earthquake, the strongest earthquake registered in the last 30 years, which had its epicenter 5 kilometers northeast of Ponta da Ribeirinha, on the island of Faial, reaching a 5.8 magnitude. It was felt on Pico, with a maximum intensity level of VII on the Mercalli scale; some homes were damaged and possessions were buffeted. Other violent earthquakes which have affected the island include: the 1957–58 seismic events associated with the eruption of the Capelinhos volcano (on Faial), the February 1964 earthquake on the island of São Jorge, and the 1926 earthquake, whose epicenter was registered in the Faial–Pico Channel.

===Biome===
According to the 2018 land occupation chart of the Azores, compared to the other islands of the archipelago, Pico has, both by proportion and total land area, the largest area of intact native laurisilva forests, and broadleaf forests (which includes introduced species such as &quot;Pittosporum undulatum&quot;), that occupy, respectively, 2.9% and 30% of the island. Pico is the only island in the Azores where pasture and meadow are not the dominant landscape (accounting only for around 29% of the territory).

Like the remaining islands of the Azores, Pico suffered extensive deforestation following its occupation. While some land, especially at the coast, was used for housing, the majority was and is still used for farming, livestock and the wood industry (of &quot;Cryptomeria&quot;). Additionally, several introductions of exotic species in the 19th century, like &quot;Hydrangea macrophylla&quot;, &quot;Pittosporum undulatum&quot;, &quot;Hedychium gardnerianum&quot; and &quot;Psidium cattleyanum&quot;, resulted in invasion and destruction of the remaining native habitats.

Gaspar Frutuoso gave a brief description of the island&#x27;s flora only a century after being occupied:

Over a third of the Natura 2000 protected areas of the Azores are located on Pico. It has also the largest number of volcanic cavities (lava caves) of anywhere in the archipelago, 86 out of 225.

===Climate===

Pico, like the other islands in the archipelago, has a mild maritime climate with high precipitation and high humidity for most of the year. However, due to its distinctive topographic variation, temperature and precipitation levels vary significantly depending on altitude and location, with rainfall generally more concentrated in the east. Temperatures fluctuate by approximately 8°C (14.4°F) between the coolest month, February, and the warmest month, August.

At lower elevations, where most of the population resides, Pico has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;; Thornthwaite: &quot;B&quot;) with mild, rainy winters (mean around ) and warm, noticeably drier summers, (mean around ) although generally not dry enough to be classified as Mediterranean. It has an average annual temperature of and around of precipitation fall each year, though values as high as are typical on the central northeast coast (São Roque, Prainha and Santo Amaro). Because of its high relative humidity (around 80%), summers can feel slightly warmer than they really are.

At higher elevations, like the Achada Plateau, temperatures are cooler and precipitation increases, it therefore transitions into a wet oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Thornthwaite: &quot;A&quot;), average relative humidity stays around 90% and fogs produced by the cooling of rising air masses from the ocean are persistent, which, in turn, creates an environment typical of a cloud forest. Places such as the Caiado and Paul lakes receive, respectively, of precipitation each year and Mount Pico is recognized as receiving the largest annual rainfall in Portugal (over per year at the northeastern flanks of the volcano).

At around , the climate becomes subpolar oceanic (&quot;Cfc&quot;) (somewhat comparable to the Faroe Islands). As altitude surpasses and exceeds the planetary boundary layer, both precipitation and humidity levels decrease reaching the top of Mount Pico which is estimated to receive only of precipitation. Temperatures at the peak of the stratovolcano (~ a.s.l.) average and snow can be frequently seen in the cooler months, being one of the few places in the archipelago where this phenomenon is possible. The climate is classified as alpine at the very top.

Pico has registered the highest temperature ever recorded in the Azores, on 7 September 1985 at Pico Airport and although there are no climatic stations at Mount Pico, it is likely that the island has also experienced the lowest temperatures in the archipelago at the top of the mountain.

===Human geography===
Geological, geomorphological and climatic constraints played (and still have) a determining role in economic activity, in the distribution of urban agglomerations and in demographic evolution. The settlement pattern is a good example of adaptation to the specific physical geography of this island, developing mainly along the coast and along the roads of communication. The main urban centers, municipality seats, are located by the sea: Madalena, São Roque do Pico and Lajes do Pico.

Regarding demographic behavior, the population has continued to decline since the middle of the last century, a trend that continues to the present day. However, the 1960s and 1970s were the decades that showed a more negative population variation rate, due to the intense emigration surge that was generated at this time and that was generalized to the entire archipelago. Unlike other islands in the Azores, in the 1990s the situation did not change, continuing to register a negative population variation (-2.6%), even higher than that registered in the 1980s. According to the XIV General Census of Population (INE, 2002), the population totaled 14,806 inhabitants, which represents a decrease of 396 inhabitants compared to 1991. In 2001, the municipality of Madalena had the largest population (6,136 inhabitants), followed by Lajes do Pico (5,041 inhabitants) and São Roque (3,629 inhabitants). The population density (33.3 inhabitants/km2) was among the lowest in the archipelago and the age structure showed signs of aging, with more than 50% of the population aged between 25 and 64 years, against 30% of young people and about 20% of seniors.

As of 2021, the total population is estimated to be around 13,895 inhabitants.

==Economy==

Historically, Pico was largely dependent on Faial for its economic, political and social activities, and it still is to this day, although mitigated by the entrepreneurial dynamics of its population and by the centralities created by the autonomous regime. The close relations with the neighboring island are still established in the maritime routes that cross the channel daily. Fishing is one of the main activities of the primary sector, namely the capture of tuna for the canning industry, which mainly employs female labor in the processing of fish. Dairy farms supply raw material to the various cheese factories, whose product is highly appreciated for its artisanal characteristics (soft paste).

Currently, it is the secondary and tertiary activity sectors that have the greatest dynamism, occupying around 30% and 50% of the active population, respectively, due to the growth in the offer of services and the installation of branches of the regional administration, which generate specialized employment. The employment rate increased in the 1990s, from 35% to 40%, and contrary to the regional average, the unemployment rate remained stable from 1991 to 2001 (3.2%). However, the level of education is low, with most inhabitants having only the 1st cycle of basic education. Note that only 4.3% have higher education, which is lower than the regional average (5.2%). This situation, together with the still significant percentage of working people in the primary sector (20%), indicates an unfavorable panorama in terms of professional qualifications among the active population.

Like the other islands, tourism is also an emerging activity in Pico, seen as a strategic pillar for diversifying the economic base. The offer of accommodation has progressed, seeking to respond to the needs of an increasingly demanding destination, with five hotel units (hotels, pensions and others) and four for tourism in rural areas (2002). The support services to visitors and the establishments of restaurants, culture, car rental, tourist entertainment, among others, multiply. As the main whaling center in the Azores, economic agents knew how to transform whale watching into a flourishing business, through the reactivation of an ancestral activity with an undeniable heritage of historical and cultural interest (boats, whaling boats, lookouts, former manufacturing industries, etc.). The capture of sperm whales (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;) for oil extraction and production of meal for animal feed definitively ceased in the 1980s, due to the replacement of whale-derived products and compliance with international conventions. The first operator of «whale watching» was installed in Lajes do Pico, with around 26 companies linked to nautical activities.

===Pico Wine and vine culture===
The vine culture on Pico Island began in the late 15th century, when the settlement of the island started. The Verdelho vines found ideal conditions to grow and mature in the volcanic soil and dark stone walls (&quot;currais&quot;). Later, it was exported to many countries in Europe and the Americas, and even reached the Russian court tables. Years later, wine production is not as important an economic activity as it used to be, despite trials to improve the varieties and incentives for the restoration of &quot;currais&quot;. The vineyards, which mark the island&#x27;s landscape and ancestral cultural practices, are a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2004 (see Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture).

==Sustainable tourism==
In 2012, Pico received the QualityCoast Gold Award for its efforts to become a sustainable tourism destination. Because of this award, Pico was selected for inclusion in the global atlas for sustainable tourism DestiNet.

<text>Compiègne (; ) is a commune in the Oise department of northern France. It is located on the river Oise, and its inhabitants are called &quot;Compiégnois&quot; ().

==Administration==
Compiègne is the seat of two cantons:
* Compiègne-1 (with 19 communes and part of Compiègne)
* Compiègne-2 (with 16 communes and part of Compiègne)

==History by year==
* 665 - Saint Wilfrid was consecrated Bishop of York. Wilfrid refused to be consecrated in Northumbria at the hands of Anglo-Saxon bishops. Deusdedit, Archbishop of Canterbury, had died, and as there were no other bishops in Britain whom Wilfrid considered to have been validly consecrated, he travelled to Compiègne, to be consecrated by Agilbert, the Bishop of Paris.
* 757 - Byzantine emperor Constantine V sent to Compiègne a gift for Pepin the Short : France&#x27;s first organ.
* 833 - Louis the Pious (also known as King Louis I, the Debonair) was deposed in Compiègne.
* February 888 - Odo, Count of Paris and king of the Franks was crowned in Compiègne.
* 23 May 1430 - During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Joan of Arc was captured by the Burgundians while attempting to free Compiègne. They then sold her to the English.
* 1557 - Battle of St. Quentin, where Habsburg Spanish forces defeat a French army in the Italian War of 1551–1559
* 1558 - The English occupy Compiègne
* 1624 - Compiègne gave its name to the Treaty of Compiègne, a treaty of alliance concluded by Cardinal Richelieu with the Dutch.
* 1630 - Marie de&#x27; Medici&#x27;s attempts to displace Richelieu ultimately led to her exile to Compiègne, from where she escaped to Brussels in 1631.
* 17 July 1794 - The Martyrs of Compiègne are executed in Paris during the Reign of Terror.
* 1900 - The golf events for the 1900 Summer Olympics took place.
* 11 November 1918 - The Armistice with Germany (Compiègne), agreed at Le Francport near Compiègne, ends fighting of World War I
* 22 June 1940 - Another Armistice with France (Second Compiègne) was signed between Nazi Germany and the defeated France in Le Francport, near Compiègne, in the same place as in 1918, in the same railroad carriage, but with the seats swapped.
* 1941 - During the German occupation of France, the Compiègne internment camp was established in Compiègne. A memorial of the camp, and another along the railway tracks, commemorate the tragedy.
* 1972 - Creation of the University of Technology of Compiègne
* 1977 - The starting location of the Paris–Roubaix bicycle race was changed from Paris to Compiègne.

===Population===

Compiègne is the central commune of an urban unit with 70,699 inhabitants, and a larger commuter zone with 141,504 inhabitants as of 2017. The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Compiègne proper.

==Sights==
The Hôtel de Ville (town hall) was completed in 1530.

===Museums===
* Château de Compiègne - the castle itself, and museums of the Second French Empire and of motoring and tourism within its walls
* Musée Antoine Vivenel
* Museum of historic figurines
* Memorial of internment and deportation

===Compiègne Forest===

The Glade of the Armistice in the Compiègne Forest was the site of the signing of two armistices; those of 11 November 1918 and 22 June 1940. Hitler specifically chose the location of the second, and had the original signing carriage moved from Paris to Compiègne, as an irony for the defeated French.

The site still houses several memorials to the 1918 armistice, including a copy of the original railway carriage. The original, Marshal Foch&#x27;s Carriage was taken to Germany as a trophy of victory following the second armistice. Various rumors about what happened to this railway-carriage thereafter, have flourished ever since. Some believe it was destroyed by the SS in Thuringia in April 1945; others say this happened in Berlin, but most likely was it destroyed during an allied air-raid on Berlin. The latter version seems most plausible, since Ferdinand Foch&#x27;s carriage actually was displayed at a Berlin museum.

== The University of Technology of Compiègne ==

Compiègne is home to the University of Technology of Compiègne (UTC), one of the top ranking engineering school in France, founded as a Technology University in 1972 to provide an alternative to the traditional &quot;grandes écoles&quot; for students interested in technologies and applied science.

<text>Friuli (; ; or ; ; ) is a historical region of northeast Italy. The region is marked by its separate regional and ethnic identity predominantly tied to the Friulians, who speak the Friulian language. It comprises the major part of the autonomous region Friuli-Venezia Giulia, i.e. the administrative provinces of Udine, Pordenone, and Gorizia, excluding Trieste.

== Names ==
The name originates from the ancient Roman town of (&quot;Julius&#x27; Forum&quot;), now Cividale del Friuli.

== Geography ==
Friuli is bordered on the west by the Veneto region with the border running along the Livenza river, on the north by the crest of the Carnic Alps between Carnia and Austrian Carinthia, on the east by the Julian Alps, the border with Slovenia and the Timavo river, and on the south by the Adriatic Sea. The adjacent Slovene parts of the Soča/Isonzo valley from Gorizia/Nova Gorica up to Triglav and the Vipava Valley, forming the &quot;Goriška&quot; region, may also be considered part of historic Friuli.

The mountainous northern part of the region belongs to the Southern Limestone Alps. From west to east, the region&#x27;s highest peaks are, in the Carnic Prealps (&quot;Dolomiti Friulane&quot;)—the Cima dei Preti, , Duranno , and Cridola ; in the Carnic Alps—Peralba , Monte Bìvera and Coglians ; in the Julian Alps, the Jôf Fuârt , the Jôf di Montasio , Mangart , and Canin , which dominates the plain. 
Rivers flowing southwards from the mountains are numerous. The Friulian mountains surround the course of the Tagliamento river, which, at the latitude of Gemona del Friuli first crosses the hills that occupy the center of the Friuli, then flows into a large flood plain. This plain is commonly divided into the High Friulian plain and the Low Friulian plain (Bassa Friulana), whose boundary is the Napoleonic road that connects the cities of Codroipo and Palmanova. To the south of this road is the &quot;risorgive&quot; zone, where water resurfaces from underground waterways in spring-fed pools throughout the area. South of the plains lie the lagoons of Marano and Grado, which are nature reserves. Other important rivers include the Torre, Natisone, Stella, Isonzo/Soča, and Ausa.

Friuli covers an area of , subdivided among the provinces of Udine , Pordenone and Gorizia . The historical capital and most important city is Udine, which was also the capital of the medieval Patria del Friuli. Other important towns are Pordenone, Gorizia/Nova Gorica, Sacile, Codroipo, Cervignano del Friuli, Cividale del Friuli, Gemona del Friuli, Monfalcone, and Tolmezzo.

== Climate ==
The climate of the Friulian plain is mainly humid subtropical. The climate in this area is suitable for growing white wine grapes, and 2.5% of wine produced in Italy comes from this part of the region. The hills, however, have a continental climate, and the mountainous regions have an alpine climate. On the coast the mean annual temperature is , while in the inner plains, the average is lowered to ; Udine , Pordenone , Gorizia ). Further north, in Tolmezzo, the average temperature is approximately . The lowest values are recorded in the Alps: at &quot;Passo di Monte Croce Carnico&quot; (at ) and between in Val Canale, which is situated above sea level. In the coldest month, January, temperatures vary between approximately in Monfalcone and nearly in &quot;Passo di Monte Croce Carnico&quot;, with intermediate temperatures of in Udine and in Valcanale. Gorizia, a short distance from Udine, enjoys a particularly milder micro-climate with its approximate annual average of . In the warmest month, July, the temperatures range between along the coast and plains and between in Val Canale.
Precipitation in Friuli is relatively abundant; the distribution of rainfall varies a great deal during the course of the year. Minimum values in the southern part generally fall between (Gorizia over and Udine over ), whereas the alpine area&#x27;s maximum annual rainfall is approximately . The Julian Prealps is one of Italy&#x27;s rainiest regions: Musi receives about of annual precipitation, sometimes even 5000 mm, and can receive in a single month. In some areas of Friuli, excessive rainfall has caused erosion and the flooding of many rivers. Snow is sparse in the southern plains (3 or 4 snowy days each year in Udine and Pordenone) but falls more consistently further to the north (Val Canale 25 days, Sauris 23 days, and &quot;Passo di Monte Croce Carnico&quot; 28 days).

The following weatherbox is from Udine, the main city of Friuli.

== Demography ==
Friuli, Mandament of Portogruaro included, is inhabited by over 1,000,000 people.

One of the most important demographic phenomena in Friuli was emigration. It began in the final decades of the 19th century and ended in the 1970s. It is estimated that more than a million Friulian people emigrated away over a period of approximately one hundred years. According to the most recent census by AIRE (2005), Friulian émigrés living abroad number 134,936. Of these, 56.0% reside in Europe, 24.0% in South America, 10.3% in North America and 4.7% in Oceania. This data only reflects those Friulians and their descendants who have Italian citizenship. The descendants of Friulians are excluded from the census because they are not Italian citizens. Friulians in the world have supported cultural associations called Fogolârs furlans, of which there are 46 in Italy and 156 in the rest of the world.

== History ==

===Origins and the Roman era===
In the prehistoric era, Friuli was home to the Castellieri culture and the Raeti. These peoples were the dominant culture in the area from about the 15th century BC until the early historical period. During the course of the 4th century BC Friuli was also settled by the Carni (in ancient Greek &quot;Καρνίοι&quot;), a tribe of unknown ethnicity which may have spoken a Celtic, a Venetic or a Rhaetic language, and which introduced advanced techniques of working iron and silver. According to Strabo [4.6] the Carni inhabited &quot;the country about the Adriatic Gulf and Aquileia&quot; and both Pliny [3.22(18)] and Ptolemy [3.1] ascribe Aquileia, Concordia and Forum Julii to belong to the &quot;towns of the Carni&quot; in the &quot;country of the Carni&quot;. The Carni worshiped the deity Belenus which is attested by the most numerous votive inscriptions found in and around Aquileia. A northern mountainous area of Friuli still retains the ancient name Carnia.

Beginning from the 2nd century BC, Friuli was colonized by the Romans: Aquileia was the fourth largest city of Italy during Roman imperial times, capital of &quot;Regio X&quot; of the Italia province (the Augustan region &quot;Venetia et Histria&quot;). The city was the most important river port on the Natissa river, dominating trade between the Adriatic Sea and northern Europe (carried over the Via Iulia Augusta road). Aquileia owed its importance to the strategic position it has on the Adriatic sea and its proximity to the Alps. This location allowing Rome to intercept barbarian invasions from the East. Julius Caesar quartered his legions in Aquileia during winter. The development of other centers, such as &quot;Forum Iulii&quot; (Cividale del Friuli) and &quot;Iulium Carnicum&quot; (Zuglio), contributed to the increase in economic and cultural wealth of Friuli until the first barbarian incursions, at the beginning of the 5th century. In the final decades of the 3rd century, Aquileia became the center of one of the most prestigious bishoprics of the empire, competing in Italy with Milan and, subsequently, Ravenna, for second place to Rome. A Hun invasion marked the start of Friuli&#x27;s decline: Aquileia, protected by meager forces, was forced to surrender and was razed to the ground by Attila in 452. After the retreat of the Huns, the survivors, who had found shelter in the lagoon of Grado, returned to the city, but found it completely destroyed. The reconstruction of Aquileia was never completed and it never regained the old splendour of the capital of &quot;X Regio&quot;. The city remained important even after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, due to the creation of the Patriarchate of Aquileia. It ranked among the highest ecclesiastic authorities in Italy from the mid-6th century onward. The lack of security in the Friulian plain, crossroads of all the great barbarian invasions, drove many people to seek shelter on the islands of the lagoons or in fortified hill-villages, causing a generalized depopulation of the more fertile part of the region and its consequent colonization by barbarian &quot;gentes&quot;.

===Middle Ages===

After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, Friuli belonged to the kingdom of Odoacer and subsequently to that of Theodoric the Great. The Byzantine reconquest under Justinian I was brief in the region, in 568 it was one of the first provinces conquered by the Lombards, who invaded from Pannonia, and with that, ended the Greek-Byzantine era of the region. The Lombard king Alboin established the Duchy of Friuli, the first Lombard duchy, and granted it to his relative Gisulf I. The capital of the duchy was established at &quot;Forum Iulii&quot; (Cividale del Friuli), which became the most important city of the area and for where it derived its name.

The duchy of Friuli was from the start one of the most important Lombard duchies. It served as a barrier against the threat of invasion by the Avars and Slavs from Pannonia. Among the duchies of the North, which were closely aligned with the crown (unlike Spoleto and Benevento to the South), it was the most powerful, probably due to its marcher status. Among later dukes, Ratchis became king in 744 and his ducal successor, Aistulf, succeeded him as king in 749. The historian Paul the Deacon was born in Friuli (730/5), he went on to write the &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; and taught Latin grammar at Charlemagne&#x27;s court. Another teacher and a trusted advisor Charlemagne&#x27;s court, Paulinus, was born at Cividale and eventually became patriarch of Aquileia.

After the Kingdom of Italy fell to the Franks, the duchy of Friuli was reorganized into counties according to the Frankish model. The region was again reorganized into the March of Friuli in 846. The march was granted to the Unruoching dynasty. Friuli became the base of power of Berengar I during his struggles for the throne of Italy between 888 and 924.

The march was transformed under his rule, its territory extended to Lake Garda, the capital moved to Verona, and a new March of Verona and Aquileia established in its place. The territory was now subjected to the Duchy of Bavaria, then to the Duchy of Carinthia, for more than a century.

On 3 April 1077, the Emperor Henry IV granted the county of Friuli, with ducal status, to Sigaerd, Patriarch of Aquileia. In the succeeding centuries, the patriarchate expanded its control over neighboring Trieste, Istria, Carinthia, Styria, and Cadore. The patriarchal state of Friuli was one of the best organized polities of the Italian Middle Ages. From the 12th century it possessed a parliament representing the communes as well as the nobility and the clergy. This institution only survived six centuries, remaining alive yet weak even during Venetian domination. It convened for the last time in 1805, when it was abolished by Napoleon Bonaparte. The Patriarch Marquard of Randeck (1365–1381) had gathered together and codified all the laws of Friuli and promulgated them as the &quot;Constitutiones Patriae Foriiulii&quot; (&quot;Constitutions of the Country of Friuli&quot;). Cividale del Friuli was seat of the Patriarchate until 1238, when the patriarch moved his seat to Udine, where he had a magnificent episcopal edifice constructed. Udine was so important that it in time became the institutional capital of Friuli.

===Venetian domination to Bourbon restoration===

The Patriarchate ended in 1420: surrounded by the powerful states of the Austrian Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Republic of Venice, it was the theatre of a war between Hungary and Venice, and was conquered by the latter. Friuli maintained some form of autonomy, by keeping its own Parliament ruling on the old territory of the Patriarchate, an autonomy not granted to the other cities and provinces submitted to Venice (even Venetian ones); on the other side, it maintained also its feudal nobility, which was able to keep their feudal rights over the land and its inhabitants for some time.

Friuli was the eastern border of the &quot;Stato da Tera&quot;, and suffered both from Ottoman raids and from the border wars with Austria. These wars led to poverty and instability of the rural population, with the inability to cultivate the land crossed by fighting armies and with the forced surrender of all livestock to feed traveling troops. The harvesting of timber needed to build Venetian ships caused complete deforestation of the Bassa Friulana and central Friuli. Venice took possession of collective farms belonging to rural Friulian communities, seriously impoverishing them. These properties in turn would be sold by Venice during the 17th century to raise cash to alleviate its poor financial condition.

Beginning in the 1630s, the Venetian Republic entered a relative decline, due to the enlarging horizon of European markets (reaching now from Asia to Africa to the Americas). Venice&#x27;s richest families often directed financial resources into unproductive investments (specifically real estate), while there was a loss of competitiveness in industries and services. Friuli was subject to increasing fiscal pressure, and its industries and commercial activities were affected.
According to some historians, the political populism practiced by Venice looked for ways to limit the most oppressive and anachronistic effects of feudalism. Other researchers assert that the Venetian aristocratic government maintained a most oppressive feudal condition in Friuli. These policies were practiced by the Venetian government to ensure the support of the urban and rural population as a counterbalance to the independent tendencies and power of local oligarchies and aristocrats.

An important jacquerie, known as &quot;Joibe Grasse 1511&quot; (Fat Thursday 1511), was started in Udine on February 27 by starving &quot;Udinesi&quot; citizens. They were subsequently joined by the farmers and the revolt spread to the whole territory of Friûl, against the feudal rule of some noble families; some other noble family, like the pro-Venetian Savorgnan, initially supported the revolters. This insurrection was one of the largest in Renaissance Italy and it lasted from 27 February until 1 March, when it ended as Venice dispatched around one hundred cavalry to put down the rebellion. The chiefs of the revolt were executed, but the feudal powers of the Friulian noblemen were reduced.

With the 1516 Noyon pacts the boundary between the Venetian Republic and the County of Gorizia and Gradisca, now in the hands of the House of Habsburg, were redefined. Venice lost the upper Isonzo valley (that is the Gastaldia of Tolmino with Plezzo and Idria), but it kept Monfalcone, Marano and a series of shed feudal islands in the Western Friuli stayed with the Archduke of Austria (until 1543). Between 1615 and 1617 Venice and Austria again fought for the possession of the fort of Gradisca d&#x27;Isonzo. The so-called War of Gradisca ended with a return to the &quot;status quo&quot;.

Beginning in 1516 the Habsburg Empire controlled eastern Friuli, while western and central Friuli was Venetian. In 1797, the year of the Treaty of Campo Formio, this part of the Friuli was surrendered to Austria. For a brief period from 1805 until the Bourbon Restoration, Friuli belonged to the Italic Kingdom.

===From the Restoration to the Great War===
In 1815, the Congress of Vienna confirmed the union of Veneto, which Central-West Friuli was part of, with Lombardy (previously divided between Austrian Empire and Venetian Republic), to constitute the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia. Eastern Friuli was not included in the puppet state. In 1838, the District of Portogruaro was removed from the Province of the Friuli due to the Austrians&#x27; wishes and assigned to the Province of Venice. Portogruaro was for long time part of Friuli, even under Venetian Republic, and Friulian language was spoken in the area. In 1866, central Friuli (today&#x27;s province of Udine) and western Friuli (today&#x27;s province of Pordenone) were annexed by Italy together with Veneto after the Third Italian War of Independence, while eastern Friuli (County of Gorizia and Gradisca) remained under Austria until the end of World War I.

The Ethnographic map of Karl von Czoernig-Czernhausen, issued by the k. u. k. Administration of Statistics in 1855, recorded a total of 401,357 Friulians living in the Austrian Empire. The majority of Friulians (351,805) lived in that part of Friuli that belonged to the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, the others (49.552) in the Friulian parts of the Austrian Küstenland. Friulians were registered as their own category separate from Italians.

During World War I, Friuli was a theater of battle that had serious consequences for the civilian population, specifically the Battle of Caporetto.

===Autonomist movements===
After World War II, the pro-devolution movement gained momentum in 1945. Friuli got entangled in the maze of opposing forces acting in the territory. Yugoslavian Titoists pursued an annexation of Friuli to the rising communist Yugoslavia. By contrast, in 1945, the traditionalist association Patrie tal Friul was founded by Tiziano Tessitori with a view to establishing an autonomous Friuli within Italy. The draft autonomic project was launched with the support of the Christian Democratic Party.

In January 1947, the poet and filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini went on to found the party Movimiento Popolari Friulano, with the same purpose of devolution. Pasolini opposed a possible Yugoslavian annexation, but at the same time lashed out at those who aimed at using regionalism for their immobilist, &quot;backwards Conservatism&quot;. Pasolini dropped membership in his party after the Christian Democrats came to pull its strings. The Communist Party of Italy opposed devolution, sticking to an Italian centralist agenda.

Around 350,000 people claim Friulan as their native language, though it is sparsely used in public life. There are some movements and political parties that advocate a more autonomous, or even an independent Friuli in line with historical borders, such as the Friuli Movement, Front Furlan, Patrie Furlane and Republiche dal Friûl – Parlament furlan.

== Regional languages and dialects ==
While standard Italian is the primary official language of the region, several other regional languages and dialects are spoken in Friuli.

Friulian is spoken in the provinces of Udine, Gorizia, and Pordenone.

Venetian and its dialects are usually spoken (for historical reasons) on the western border regions (i.e. Pordenone), sparingly in a few internal towns (i.e. Gorizia, etc.), and historically in some places along the Adriatic coast.

In the southeastern part of Friuli, a Venetian transitional dialect is spoken, called &quot;Bisiaco&quot;, that has influences of both Slovene and Friulian.

Slovene dialects are spoken in the largely rural border mountain region known as Venetian Slovenia. German (Bavarian dialect) is spoken in Val Canale (mostly in Tarvisio and Pontebba); in some of Val Canale&#x27;s municipalities (particularly in Malborghetto Valbruna), Carinthian Slovenian dialects are spoken too. Slovene is also spoken in the &quot;Collio&quot; area north of Gorizia. In the Resia valley, between Venetian Slovenia and the Val Canale, most of the inhabitants still speak an archaic dialect of Slovene, known as Resian. According to the official estimates of the Italian government, between 45,000 and 51,000 Slovene speakers live in Friuli: around 11,000 in the Province of Gorizia, and the rest in the Province of Udine. Due to emigration, most Slovene speakers in the Province of Udine live outside their traditional compact zone of settlement.

German-related dialects (like Rogasaxon) are spoken in several ancient enclaves like Timau, Zahre (Sauris) and Plodn (Sappada).

Only Friulian, Slovenian and German are allowed to be local secondary official languages in their historic areas, but not their related dialects.

<text>Lights Out is an American old-time radio program devoted mostly to horror and the supernatural.

Created by Wyllis Cooper and then eventually taken over by Arch Oboler, versions of &quot;Lights Out&quot; aired on different networks, at various times, from January 3, 1934 to the summer of 1947 and the series eventually made the transition to television. &quot;Lights Out&quot; was one of the earliest radio horror programs, predating &quot;Suspense&quot; and &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot;.

==History==
===The Wyllis Cooper era===
In the fall of 1933, NBC writer Wyllis Cooper conceived the idea of &quot;a midnight mystery serial to catch the attention of the listeners at the witching hour.&quot; The idea was to offer listeners a dramatic program late at night, at a time when the competition was mostly airing music. At some point, the serial concept was dropped in favor of an anthology format emphasizing crime thrillers and the supernatural. The first series of shows (each 15 minutes long) ran on a local NBC station, WENR, at midnight Wednesdays, starting in January 1934. By April, the series proved successful enough to expand to a half-hour. In January 1935, the show was discontinued in order to ease Cooper&#x27;s workload (he was then writing scripts for the network&#x27;s prestigious &quot;Immortal Dramas&quot; program), but was brought back by huge popular demand a few weeks later. After a successful tryout in New York City, the series was picked up by NBC in April 1935 and broadcast nationally, usually late at night and always on Wednesdays. Cooper stayed on the program until June 1936, when another Chicago writer, Arch Oboler, took over. By the time Cooper left, the series had inspired about 600 fan clubs.

Cooper&#x27;s run was characterized by grisly stories spiked with dark, tongue-in-cheek humor, a sort of radio Grand Guignol. A character might be buried, eaten, or skinned alive, vaporized in a ladle of white-hot steel, absorbed by a giant slurping amoeba, have his arm torn off by a robot, or forced to endure torture, beating or decapitation—always with the appropriate blood-curdling acting and sound effects.

Though there had been efforts at horror on radio previously (notably &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Tale&quot;), there does not seem to have been anything quite as explicit or outrageous as this on a regular basis. When &quot;Lights Out&quot; switched to the national network, a decision was made to tone down the gore and emphasize tamer fantasy and ghost stories.

Only one recording survives from Cooper&#x27;s 1934–1936 run, but his less gruesome scripts were occasionally rebroadcast. An interesting example is his &quot;Three Men,&quot; which became the series&#x27; annual Christmas show (a 1937 version circulates among collectors under titles like &quot;Uninhabited&quot; or &quot;Christmas Story&quot;); it has a plot typical of Cooper&#x27;s gentler fantasies. On the first Christmas after World War I, three Allied officers meet by chance in a train compartment and find one another vaguely familiar. They fall asleep and share a dream in which they are the Three Wise Men searching for Jesus. But is it really a dream? In the best tradition of supernatural twist endings, Cooper has the officers wake to find a strange odor in their compartment—which turns out to be myrrh and frankincense.

In the mid-1940s, Cooper&#x27;s decade-old scripts were used for three brief summertime revivals of &quot;Lights Out&quot;. The surviving recordings reveal that Cooper was experimenting with both stream of consciousness and first-person narration a few years before these techniques were popularized in American radio drama by, among others, Arch Oboler and Orson Welles. In one tale (&quot;The Haunted Cell&quot;, original broadcast date unknown, rebroadcast 7/20/1946), a murderer describes how the Chicago police try to beat a confession out of him. When that doesn&#x27;t work, they put him in a jail cell haunted by the ghost of a previous occupant, a smooth gangster named Skeeter Dempsey who describes his own execution and discusses the afterlife knowledgeably. In the final twist, the narrator reveals that he has taken Skeeter&#x27;s advice to commit suicide and is now himself a ghost.

Another story, originally broadcast in March 1935 as &quot;After Five O&#x27;Clock&quot; and revived in 1945 as &quot;Man in the Middle,&quot; allows us to follow the thoughts of a businessman as he spends a day at the office cheating on his wife with his secretary. The amusing contrast between what the protagonist thinks to himself and what he says out loud to the other characters enlivens one of Cooper&#x27;s favorite plot devices, the love triangle.

One radio critic, in reviewing a March 1935 episode that used multiple first-person narrators, said:

Other Cooper scripts are more routine, perhaps in part because the author&#x27;s attention was divided by other projects. From the summer of 1933 until August 1935, Cooper was NBC Chicago&#x27;s continuity chief, supervising a staff of writers and editing their scripts. He resigned in order to devote more time to &quot;Lights Out&quot; as well as a daily aviation adventure serial, &quot;Flying Time&quot;. At various times, he also served on NBC&#x27;s Program Planning Board, wrote the soap opera &quot;Betty and Bob&quot;, and commuted weekly to produce another program in Des Moines, Iowa.

From early 1934 to mid 1936, Cooper produced close to 120 scripts for &quot;Lights Out&quot;. Some episode titles (all from 1935) include &quot;The Mine of Lost Skulls,&quot; &quot;Sepulzeda&#x27;s Revenge,&quot; &quot;Three Lights From a Match,&quot; &quot;Play Without a Name,&quot; and &quot;Lost in the Catacombs&quot; (about a honeymoon couple in Rome who lose their way in the catacombs under the city). Typical plots included:

* A novelist, struggling to write a locked room mystery, locks himself in his office only to be interrupted by a stranger who resembles the story&#x27;s murderer.
* A killer named &quot;Nails&quot; Malone has &quot;a conference with his conscience&quot; about the murders he&#x27;s committed.
* A scientist accidentally creates a giant amoeba that grows rapidly, eats living things (like the lab assistant&#x27;s cat), and exhibits powers of mind control.

The show benefited tremendously from Chicago&#x27;s considerable pool of creative talent. The city was, like New York, one of the main centers of radio production in 1930s America. Among the actors who participated regularly during the Cooper era were Sidney Ellstrom, Art Jacobson, Don Briggs, Bernardine Flynn, Betty Lou Gerson, and Betty Winkler. The sound effects technicians frequently had to perform numerous experiments to achieve the desired noises. Cooper once had them build a gallows and wasn&#x27;t satisfied until one of the sound men personally dropped through the trap. The series had little music scoring save for the thirteen chime notes that opened the program (after a deep voice intoned, &quot;Lights out, everybody!&quot;) and an ominous gong which was used to punctuate a scene and provide the transition to another.

A veteran radio dramatist, Ferrin Fraser, wrote some of the scripts.

===The Arch Oboler era===

When Cooper departed, his replacement—a young, eccentric and ambitious Arch Oboler—picked up where he left off, often following Cooper&#x27;s general example but investing the scripts with his own concerns. Oboler made imaginative use of stream-of-consciousness narration and sometimes introduced social and political themes that reflected his commitment to antifascist liberalism.

Although in later years &quot;Lights Out&quot; would be closely associated with Oboler, he was always quick to credit Cooper as the series&#x27; creator and spoke highly of the older author, calling him &quot;the unsung pioneer of radio dramatic techniques&quot; and the first person Oboler knew of who understood that radio drama could be an art form.

In June 1936, Oboler&#x27;s first script for &quot;Lights Out&quot; was &quot;Burial Service,&quot; about a paralyzed girl who is buried alive. NBC was flooded with outraged letters in response. His next story, one of his most popular efforts, was the frequently repeated &quot;Catwife,&quot; about the desperate husband of a woman who turns into a giant feline. He followed with &quot;The Dictator,&quot; about Roman emperor Caligula. This set the pattern for Oboler&#x27;s run: For every two horror episodes, he said later, he would try to write one drama on subjects that were ostensibly more serious, usually moral, social, and political issues.

Like Cooper, Oboler was much in demand and highly prolific. While working on &quot;Lights Out&quot;, he wrote numerous dramatic sketches for variety shows (&quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot;, Rudy Vallee&#x27;s programs), anthologies (&quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, &quot;The First Nighter Program&quot;, &quot;The Irene Rich Show&quot;) and specials. In August 1936, singer Vallee, then the dean of variety show hosts, claimed that &quot;Lights Out&quot; was his favorite series. Oboler occasionally redrafted his &quot;Lights Out&quot; scripts for use on Vallee&#x27;s and other variety hours. A version of Oboler&#x27;s &quot;Prelude to Murder&quot; starring Peter Lorre and Olivia de Havilland was scheduled to air on a November 1936 Vallee broadcast. Other &quot;Lights Out&quot; plays that turned up on various late 1930s variety programs included &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; (with Boris Karloff), &quot;Alter Ego&quot; (with Bette Davis) and &quot;The Harp.&quot;

Oboler met the demand by adopting an unusual scripting procedure: He would lie in bed at night, smoke cigarettes, and improvise into a Dictaphone, acting out every line of the play. In this way, he was able to complete a script quickly, sometimes in as little as 30 minutes, though he might take as long as three or four hours. In the morning, a stenographer would type up the recording for Oboler&#x27;s revisions. Years later, Rod Serling, who counted radio fantasists like Cooper, Oboler, and Norman Corwin among his inspirations, would use a similar process to churn out his many teleplays for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, a series that in many respects was to television what &quot;Lights Out&quot; was to radio.

Despite acclaim for Oboler&#x27;s dramas, NBC announced it was canceling the series in the summer of 1937—&quot;just to see whether listeners are still faithful to it,&quot; according to one press report but also, it seems, to allow the hard-working author a vacation. Another outcry from fans led to the program&#x27;s return that September for another season.

In the spring of 1938, the series earned a good deal of publicity for its fourth anniversary as a half-hour show when actor Boris Karloff, the star of many a Hollywood horror film, traveled to Chicago to appear in five consecutive episodes. Among his roles: an accused murderer haunted by an unearthly woman-like demonic creature (played by Templeton Fox) urging him to &quot;kill...kill...kill&quot; in &quot;The Dream&quot;; the desperate husband in a rebroadcast of &quot;Catwife&quot;; and a mad, violin-playing hermit who imprisons a pair of women, threatening to murder one and marry the other, in &quot;Valse Triste.&quot;

Oboler left in the summer of 1938 to pursue other projects, writing and directing several critically acclaimed dramatic anthology series: &quot;Arch Oboler&#x27;s Plays&quot;, &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Plays for Americans&quot;. A variety of NBC staff writers and freelancers filled in until &quot;Lights Out&quot; was canceled in 1939. NBC Chicago continuity editor Ken Robinson supervised some of the writing. Regular contributors included William Fifield and Hobart Donovan. A recording of the fifth anniversary show survives from this season. Donovan&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Due,&quot; about criminals haunted by a mysterious stranger, is in keeping with the formula laid down by Cooper.

In 1942, Oboler, needing money, revived the series for a year on CBS. Airing in prime time instead of late at night, the program was sponsored by the makers of Ironized Yeast. Most of the &quot;Lights Out&quot; recordings that exist today come from this version of the show. For this revival, each episode began with an ominously tolling bell over which Oboler read the cryptic tagline: &quot;It...is...later...than...you...think.&quot; This was followed by a dour &quot;warning&quot; to listeners to turn off their radios if they felt their constitutions were too delicate to handle the frightening tale that was about to unfold.

Directing and hosting the 1942–43 broadcasts, mostly from New York and Hollywood, Oboler not only reused scripts from his 1936–38 run but also revived some of the more fantasy-oriented plays from his other, more recent anthology series. Some episodes had originally aired on the author&#x27;s groundbreaking, critically acclaimed 1939–1940 program &quot;Arch Oboler&#x27;s Plays&quot;, among them:

* &quot;The Ugliest Man in the World,&quot; a sentimental tale of a hideously deformed man seeking love in a cruel world, inspired by Boris Karloff&#x27;s typecasting in horror roles.
* &quot;Bathysphere,&quot; a political thriller about a scientist and a dictator sharing a deep sea diving bell.
* &quot;Visitor from Hades,&quot; about a bickering married couple trapped in their apartment by a doppelgänger.

Another unusual script, &quot;Execution,&quot; about a mysterious French woman who bedevils the Nazis trying to hang her, had previously aired on Oboler&#x27;s wartime propaganda series &quot;Plays for Americans&quot;.

Like Cooper, Oboler made effective use of atmospheric sound effects, perhaps most memorably in his legendary &quot;Chicken Heart,&quot; a script that debuted in 1937 and was rebroadcast in 1938 and 1942. It features the simple but effective &quot;thump-thump&quot; of an ever-growing, ever-beating chicken heart which, thanks to a scientific experiment gone wrong, threatens to engulf the entire world. Although the story bears similarities to an earlier Cooper episode (about an ever-growing amoeba that makes an ominous &quot;slurp! slurp!&quot; sound), Oboler&#x27;s unique choice of monster was inspired by a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article announcing that scientists had succeeded in keeping a chicken heart alive for a considerable period of time after its having been removed from the chicken. Recordings of the original radio broadcasts are lost or unavailable, although Oboler later recreated this episode for a record album in 1962. Part of the episode&#x27;s notoriety stems from a popular standup routine by comedian Bill Cosby (on his 1966 album &quot;Wonderfulness&quot;), an account of his staying up late as a child to listen to scary radio shows against his parents&#x27; wishes and being terrified by the chicken heart. Cosby also referenced the episode in a camping episode of &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids&quot;.

Other well-remembered Oboler tales, many of them written in the 1930s and rebroadcast in the &#x27;40s, include:

* &quot;Come to the Bank,&quot; in which a man learns to walk through walls but gets stuck when he tries to rob a vault.
* &quot;Oxychloride X,&quot; about a chemist who invents a substance that can eat through anything (and releases monsters when it eats all the way through the Earth&#x27;s crust.)
* &quot;Murder Castle,&quot; based on the real-life case of H. H. Holmes, Chicago&#x27;s notorious serial killer.
* &quot;Profits Unlimited,&quot; a still-relevant allegory on the promises and dangers of capitalism.
* &quot;Spider,&quot; in which two men attempt to capture a giant arachnid.
* &quot;The Flame,&quot; a weird exercise in supernatural pyromania.
* &quot;Sub-Basement,&quot; which finds yet another husband and wife in peril—this time trapped far beneath a department store in the subterranean railway of the Chicago Tunnel Company.

&quot;Lights Out&quot; often featured metafictional humor. Perhaps inspired by Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Coffin in Studio B,&quot; in which actors rehearsing an episode of &quot;Lights Out&quot; are interrupted by a mysterious coffin salesman peddling his wares, Oboler wrote stories like &quot;Murder in the Script Department,&quot; in which two &quot;Lights Out&quot; script typists become trapped in their building after hours as frightening, unexplained events occur. In &quot;The Author and the Thing,&quot; Oboler even plays himself pitted against one of his own monstrous creations.

After the 1942–43 &quot;Lights Out&quot;, Oboler continued to work in radio (&quot;Everything for the Boys&quot; and revivals of &quot;Arch Oboler&#x27;s Plays&quot;) and pursued a second career in filmmaking, first in the Hollywood mainstream and then as an independent producer, writing and directing a number of offbeat, low-budget films, including &quot;Five,&quot; about survivors of a nuclear war, &quot;The Twonky,&quot; a satire of television, and the 3-D film &quot;Bwana Devil&quot;, which made a huge profit on a small investment. He dabbled in live television (a six-episode 1949 anthology series, &quot;Arch Oboler Comedy Theater&quot;), playwriting (&quot;Night of the Auk&quot;), and fiction (&quot;House on Fire&quot;). In 1962, he produced a spoken-word album entitled &quot;Drop Dead!&quot; (Capitol T/ST-1763), which recreated abbreviated versions of his &quot;Lights Out&quot; thrillers, including &quot;Chicken Heart&quot; and &quot;The Dark,&quot; about a mysterious creeping mist that turns people inside-out. In 1971–1972, Oboler produced a syndicated radio series, &quot;The Devil and Mr. O&quot; (he liked for people to call him &quot;Mr. O&quot;), which featured vintage recordings from &quot;Lights Out&quot; and his other series with newly recorded introductions by Mr. O himself.

===Later revivals===
The success of Oboler&#x27;s 1942–1943 &quot;Lights Out&quot; revival was part of a trend in 1940s American radio toward more horror. Genre series like &quot;Inner Sanctum,&quot; &quot;Suspense&quot; and others drew increasingly large ratings. Perhaps with this in mind, NBC broadcast another &quot;Lights Out&quot; revival series from New York in the summer of 1945, using seven of Wyllis Cooper&#x27;s original 1930s scripts. Like Oboler&#x27;s, this revival aired in the early evening and not late at night, and because of this, it was reported, &quot;only those Cooper scripts which stressed fantasy rather than horror&quot; were broadcast. These included a bloodless ghost story about a man who accidentally condemns his dead wife to haunt a nearby cemetery and &quot;The Rocket Ship&quot;, science fiction involving interstellar travel. Cooper, then an advertising executive at New York&#x27;s Compton Agency, may have had little or nothing to do with the actual broadcasts other than allowing his scripts to be performed.

This was followed by an eight-episode revival in the summer of 1946, from NBC Chicago, although at least one of the scripts is not by Cooper (an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Signal-Man&quot;). This series also avoided the use of outright gore. In fact, a review in &quot;Variety&quot; complained that the premiere episode, &quot;The Seven Plovers&quot;, was &quot;a little too serious in content for a thriller&quot; since it included &quot;religious background, philosophical discussion and dream diagnosis ...&quot;

A third series of eight vintage Cooper scripts was scheduled to run in the summer of 1947 as well. Broadcast from Hollywood over ABC Radio, it starred Boris Karloff and was sponsored by Eversharp, whose company president canceled the series after the third episode, apparently unhappy with the gruesome subject matter. The premiere, &quot;Death Robbery&quot;, featured Karloff as a scientist who brings his wife back from the dead, only to find she&#x27;s become a gibbering homicidal maniac. An uncredited Lurene Tuttle plays the wife. This episode is one of the few surviving examples of Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Lights Out&quot; work that reflects the sort of explicit horror that characterized the original series. Eversharp paid off Cooper for his five unused scripts and &quot;Lights Out&quot; ended its long run on network radio.

From 1936 to 1939, Cooper pursued a screenwriting career in Hollywood (his major credits are the screenplay for Universal&#x27;s 1939 &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; and contributions to the Mr. Moto mystery series starring Peter Lorre) but continued to work in radio, advertising and, later, television. By 1940, he had changed the spelling of his name from &quot;Willis&quot; to &quot;Wyllis&quot; (to satisfy &quot;his wife&#x27;s numerological inclinations&quot;) and lived mainly in the New York City area where he worked on a number of radio programs, the most important of which was probably Edward M. Kirby&#x27;s popular and acclaimed government propaganda series, &quot;The Army Hour,&quot; which Cooper wrote, produced and directed for its first year.

In 1947, Cooper created &quot;Quiet, Please,&quot; another radio program dealing with the supernatural, which he wrote and directed until 1949, occasionally borrowing ideas from his &quot;Lights Out&quot; stories while creating wholly new scripts that were often more sophisticated than his 1930s originals. In 1949 and 1950, he produced (and contributed scripts to) three live TV series that frequently dealt with the supernatural: &quot;Volume One&quot;, &quot;Escape&quot; and &quot;Stage 13&quot;.

==Television==

In 1946, NBC Television brought &quot;Lights Out&quot; to TV in a series of four specials, broadcast live and produced by Fred Coe, who also contributed three of the scripts. NBC asked Cooper to write the script for the premiere, &quot;First Person Singular&quot;, which is told entirely from the point of view of an unseen murderer who kills his obnoxious wife and winds up being executed. &quot;Variety&quot; gave this first episode a rave review (&quot;undoubtedly one of the best dramatic shows yet seen on a television screen&quot;), but &quot;Lights Out&quot; did not become a regular NBC-TV series until 1949.

Coe initially produced this second series but, for much of its run, the live 1949–1952 program was sponsored by appliance maker Admiral, produced by Herbert Bayard Swope, Jr., directed by Laurence Schwab, Jr., and hosted by Frank Gallop. Critical response was mixed but the program was successful for several seasons (sometimes appearing in the weekly lists of the ten most watched network shows) until competition from the massively popular sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; on CBS helped to kill it off.

The 1949–1952 series featured scripts by a variety of authors, including a young Ira Levin. In 1951, producer Swope even bought a few stories from Cooper and Oboler. &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Coat,&quot; starring Basil Rathbone, was adapted from one of Cooper&#x27;s 1930s plays (and not to be confused with his &quot;Quiet, Please&quot; episode &quot;Wear the Dead Man&#x27;s Coat&quot; with which it shares a similar premise). Oboler&#x27;s &quot;And Adam Begot,&quot; adapted by Ernest Kinoy from a radio play, starred Kent Smith. Among the young actors employed was Leslie Nielsen, who appeared in several episodes including &quot;The Lost Will of Dr. Rant,&quot; based on &quot;The Tractate Middoth&quot;, an M. R. James story. These and many others are available on DVD.

Other notable guest stars included Anne Bancroft, Grace Kelly, Eva Marie Saint, Lee J. Cobb, Anthony Quinn, Jessica Tandy, Veronica Lake, John Forsythe, Boris Karloff, Beatrice Straight, Eli Wallach, Vincent Price, Jane Wyatt, Felicia Montealegre Bernstein and Jack Palance.

Notable directors included Delbert Mann and Fred Coe.

===Episodes===
===Later versions===
In 1972, NBC aired yet another TV incarnation of &quot;Lights Out,&quot; a TV movie pilot which was not well received. In fact, Oboler (who was then syndicating his &quot;The Devil and Mr. O&quot; radio show) announced publicly that he had nothing to do with it.

Despite its modest television success, radio historian John Dunning suggested that the legend of &quot;Lights Out&quot; is firmly rooted in radio.

==Influence==
*&quot;What the Devil&quot; (1942), about two motorists menaced by a truck whose driver they cannot see, was similar in plot to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s TV movie &quot;Duel&quot;, adapted by Richard Matheson from his own short story. Oboler, feeling his copyright had been infringed, claimed in an interview that he &quot;reached for a lawyer and got paid off by Universal Studios.&quot;

<text>Jerichower Land () is a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the north-east of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Its neighbouring administrative units are (clockwise from the south): the districts of Anhalt-Bitterfeld, Salzlandkreis, the city of Magdeburg, the districts of Börde, Stendal, Havelland and Potsdam-Mittelmark in Brandenburg.

== History ==
In 1816, the area of the district became part of the Prussian province of Saxony, and was split administratively into three districts, Jerichow I, Jerichow II and Ziesar. The district of Ziesar was added into Jerichow I in 1826.

After World War II, the districts were rearranged. Some areas of the two districts were added to the neighbouring districts of Havelberg, Rathenow, Brandenburg, Loburg and Zerbst. The two districts were also renamed after their administrative seats, thus Jerichow I became &quot;District Burg&quot;, and Jerichow II became &quot;District Genthin&quot;. In 1952, the district of Burg was split into two parts. However, in 1957, the district of Loburg was recombined with the district of Burg.

In 1994, the two districts of Burg and Genthin were merged, and re-adopted the historical name of Jerichow. In 2007, 6 municipalities from the former district of Anhalt-Zerbst (Hobeck, Lohburg, Lübs, Prödel, Rosian and Schweinitz) were added to Jerichower Land District.

The name of the district derives from the city of Jerichow, the name of which is related to that of an early Slavic tribal grouping. It is not related to the name for the city of Jericho in the Middle East.

==Geography==
The area of the district is . Main water bodies in the district are the rivers Elbe, Ehle, Ihle and Nuthe as well as the Elbe-Havel canal.
==Coat of arms==
The vertical bars in the left half of the coat of arms symbolize the Elbe-Havel canal, while the crane in the right symbolizes the nature in the district. Cranes are common birds in the district.

==Towns and municipalities==
The district Jerichower Land consists of the following subdivisions:
==Economy==
The LFD Holding has its headquarters and several production plants in the district.

<text>A seaside resort is a city, town, village, or hotel that serves as a vacation resort and is located on a coast. Sometimes the concept includes an aspect of an official accreditation based on the satisfaction of certain requirements such as in the German &quot;Seebad&quot;. Where a beach is the primary focus for tourists, it may be called a beach resort.

==History==

Seaside resorts have existed since antiquity. In Roman times, the town of Baiae by the Tyrrhenian Sea in Italy was a resort for those who were sufficiently prosperous. Barcola by the Adriatic Sea in northern Italy with its Roman luxury villas is considered a special example of ancient leisure culture by the sea. Mersea Island in Essex, England was a seaside holiday destination for wealthy ancient Romans living in Colchester.

The development of the beach as a popular leisure resort from the mid-19th century was the first manifestation of what is now the global tourist industry. The first seaside resorts were opened in the 18th century for the aristocracy, who began to frequent the seaside as well as the then fashionable spa towns, for recreation and health. One of the earliest such seaside resorts was Scarborough in Yorkshire during the 1720s; it had been a popular spa town since a stream of acidic water was discovered running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town in the 17th century. The first rolling bathing machines were introduced by 1735.

In 1793, Heiligendamm in Mecklenburg, Germany was founded as the first seaside resort of the European continent, which successfully attracted Europe&#x27;s aristocracy to the Baltic Sea.

The opening of the resort in Brighton and its reception of royal patronage from King George IV extended the seaside as a resort for health and pleasure to the much larger London market, and the beach became a centre for upper-class pleasure and frivolity. This trend was praised and artistically elevated by the new romantic ideal of the picturesque landscape; Jane Austen&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;Sanditon&quot; is an example of that. Later, Queen Victoria&#x27;s long-standing patronage of the Isle of Wight and Ramsgate in Kent ensured that a seaside residence was considered a highly fashionable possession for those wealthy enough to afford more than one home.

===Seaside resorts for the middle and working classes===

The extension of this form of leisure to the middle and working classes began with the development of the railways in the 1840s; they offered cheap travel to fast-growing resort towns. In particular, the branch line to the small seaside town of Blackpool from Poulton-le-Fylde led to a sustained economic and demographic boom. A sudden influx of visitors arriving by rail motivated entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions, leading to more visitors and rapid growth throughout the 1850s and 1860s.

The growth was intensified by the practice among the Lancashire cotton mill owners of closing the factories for a week every year to service and repair machinery. These became known as wakes weeks. Each town&#x27;s mills would close for a different week, allowing Blackpool to manage a steady and reliable stream of visitors over a prolonged period in the summer. A prominent feature of the resort was the promenade and the pleasure piers, where an eclectic variety of performances vied for the people&#x27;s attention. In 1863, the North Pier in Blackpool was completed, rapidly becoming a centre of attraction for elite visitors. Central Pier was completed in 1868, with a theatre and a large open-air dance floor.

Many popular beach resorts were equipped with bathing machines, because even the all-covering beachwear of the period was considered immodest.

By the end of the century the English coastline had over 100 large resort towns, some with populations exceeding 50,000.

===Expansion around the world===
The development of the seaside resort abroad was stimulated by the well-developed English love of the beach. The French Riviera on the Mediterranean Sea had already become a destination for the British upper class by the end of the 18th century. In 1864, the first railway to Nice was completed, making the Riviera accessible to visitors from all over Europe. By 1874, foreign residents in Nice, mostly British, numbered 25,000. The coastline became renowned for attracting the royalty of Europe, including Queen Victoria and King Edward VII.

In the United States, early seaside resorts in the late 1800s catered to the wealthy, including city businessmen. Cape May, New Jersey became one of the first coastal resorts in the United States, when regular steamboat traffic on the Delaware River began after the War of 1812. Early visitors to Cape May included Henry Clay in 1847, and Abraham Lincoln in 1849. By 1880, Henry Flagler had extended several rail lines southward down the US Atlantic coastline, enticing northern upper-class families south to subtropical Florida. The Florida East Coast Railway brought northern tourists to St. Augustine in greater numbers, and by 1887 Flagler began to build two large ornate hotels in St. Augustine, the 540-room Ponce de Leon Hotel and the Hotel Alcazar, and bought the Casa Monica Hotel the next year.

Continental European attitudes towards gambling and nudity tended to be more lax than in Britain, and British and French entrepreneurs were quick to exploit the possibilities. In 1863, the Prince of Monaco, Charles III and François Blanc, a French businessman, arranged for steamships and carriages to take visitors from Nice to Monaco, where large luxury hotels, gardens and casinos were built. The place was renamed Monte Carlo. Commercial seabathing also spread to other areas of the United States and parts of the British Empire such as Australia, where surfing became popular in the early 20th century. By the 1970s cheap and affordable air travel was the catalyst for the growth of a global tourism market.

Since the late 20th century, recreational fishing and leisure boat pursuits have become very lucrative, and traditional fishing villages are often well positioned to take advantage of this. Destin, Florida, for instance, has evolved from an artisanal fishing village into a seaside resort dedicated to tourism with a large fishing fleet of recreational charter boats.

Germany is known for its traditional seaside resorts on the Baltic Sea and the North Sea coasts, mainly established in the 19th century. In German they are called &quot;Seebad&quot; (&quot;Sea Spa&quot;) or &quot;Seeheilbad&quot;, sometimes with &quot;Ostsee-&quot; or &quot;Nordsee-&quot; as prefixes for the respective coastline.

The most prestigious resorts can be found along the Baltic coastline, including the islands of Rugia and Usedom. They often feature a unique architectural style called resort architecture. The coast of Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania alone has an overall length of 2000 km and is nicknamed &quot;German Riviera&quot;. Heiligendamm in Mecklenburg, established in 1793, is the oldest seaside resort in Germany and continental Europe.

Most important coastal areas with seaside resorts in Germany:
* Baltic Sea: islands of Fehmarn, Hiddensee, Rügen, Usedom; Mecklenburg coast, Rostock, peninsula of Fischland, Darss and Zingst
* North Sea: East Frisian Islands and North Frisian Islands

===India===

India has a long coastline and hence has numerous beaches and resort towns. Beaches were already a popular tourist destination for the kings and the masses alike especially in South India where the Dravidian Empires built large temples near the seashore. Beaches are also associated with Hindu rituals where pilgrims from different parts of India go for worshipping rituals. The sun rise and Sunset are also associated with Hindu traditions which are considered sacred my many Hindu communities and there are festivals to celebrate the sunset and sunrise. A major example of such festivals is Chhath Puja. The British Raj also contributed in the development of Beach Resorts where Europeans used to visit during the harsh and cold winter of Europe.

The archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep are also famous for beach resorts. Other beach resorts in India includes:
* Digha

=== Ireland ===
The &#x27;Irish Riviera&#x27; on the South Coast of Ireland features the seaside resorts of Youghal, Ardmore, Dungarvan, Cóbh and Ballycotton, all set close to the south coast of Ireland. Youghal has been a favoured holiday destination for over 100 years, situated on the banks of the River Blackwater as it reaches the sea. Dungarvan is a seaside market town beneath the mountains in the centre of the Irish south coast. Kinsale is often described as a food lover&#x27;s and yachting town, with a diverse range of restaurants, as well as a large and active creative community with numerous art galleries and record and book shops.

Seaside resorts in the East of Ireland developed after the introduction of rail travel. The Dublin and Kingstown Railway introduced day-trippers from Dublin to Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) in South Dublin, and the coastal town became Ireland&#x27;s first seaside resort. Other South Dublin towns and villages such as Sandycove, Dalkey and Killiney grew as seaside resorts when the rail network was expanded. Since the opening of Bray Daly Station in 1852, the County Wicklow coastal town of Bray has become the largest seaside resort on the East Coast of Ireland. The town of Greystones, five miles south of Bray, also grew as a seaside resort when the railway line was extended in 1855. Other seaside resorts include Courtown and Rosslare Strand in County Wexford.

Ulster has a number of seaside resorts, such as Portrush, situated on the north coast, with its two beaches and a world-famous golf course, Royal Portrush Golf Club. Other Ulster seaside resorts are Newcastle, located on the east coast at the foot of the Mourne Mountains; Ballycastle; Portstewart; Rathmullan; Bundoran and Bangor. Bangor Marina is one of the largest in Ireland and the marina has on occasion been awarded the Blue Flag for attention to environmental issues.

The main seaside towns in the west of Ireland are in County Clare; the largest are Lahinch and Kilkee. Lahinch is a popular surfing location.

Like British resorts, many seaside towns in Ireland have turned to other entertainment industries. Larger resorts such as Bray or Portrush host air shows, while most resorts host summer festivals.

=== Israel ===

Israel is a major tourist area. Tourism in Israel is one of the major sources of income, with beautiful beaches, such as those found on the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Most tourists come from the United States and European countries. Other resorts include: 
* Ashdod

=== United Kingdom ===

The United Kingdom saw the popularisation of seaside resorts, and nowhere was this more seen than in Blackpool. Blackpool catered for workers from across industrial Northern England, who packed its beaches and promenade. Other northern seaside towns (for example Bridlington, Cleethorpes, Morecambe, Scarborough, Skegness, and Southport) shared in the success of this new concept, especially from trade during wakes weeks. The concept spread rapidly to other British coastal towns, including several on the coast of North Wales, notably Rhyl, and Llandudno, the largest resort in Wales and known as &quot;The Queen of the Welsh Resorts&quot;, from as early as 1864. As the 19th century progressed, British working class day-trippers travelled on organised trips such as railway excursions, or by steamer, for which long piers were erected so that the ships bringing the trade could berth.

Another area notable for its seaside resorts was (and is) the Firth of Clyde, outside Glasgow. Glaswegians would take a ferry &quot;doon the watter&quot; from the city, down the River Clyde, to the Firth&#x27;s islands and peninsulas and beyond, such as Cowal, Bute, Arran, and Kintyre. Resorts include Rothesay, Lamlash, Whiting Bay, Dunoon, Tighnabruaich, Carrick Castle, Helensburgh, Largs, Millport and Campbeltown. In contrast to many resorts, some on the Firth of Clyde have continued to prosper as middle-class commuter towns.

Some resorts, especially those more southerly such as Hastings, Worthing, Eastbourne, Bournemouth, and Brighton were built as new towns or extended by local landowners to appeal to wealthier holidaymakers. Others came about due to their proximity to large urban areas of population, such as Southend-on-Sea, which became increasingly popular with residents of London once rail links were established to it allowing day trips from London. The sunshine and sea air were seen by Victorians as beneficial for health, and resorts such as Ventnor owed their growth to a visit being considered as treatment for chest complaints. Owing to its generally better climate, the south coast has many seaside towns, the most being in Sussex.

In the later 20th century, the popularity of the British seaside resort declined for the same reason that it first flourished: advances in transport. The greater accessibility of foreign holiday destinations, through package holidays and, more recently, European low-cost airlines, makes it easier to holiday abroad. Despite the loyalty of returning holidaymakers, resorts such as Blackpool have struggled to compete against the hotter weather of Southern Europe and the sunbelt in the United States. Now, many symbols of the traditional British resort (holiday camps, end-of-the-pier shows and saucy postcards) are regarded by some as drab and outdated; the skies are imagined to be overcast and the beach windswept. This is not always true; for example Broadstairs in Kent has retained much of its old world charm with Punch and Judy and donkey rides and still remains popular, being only one hour from the M25. Brighton has also seen a fall in visitor numbers in recent years. The city has also experienced a rise in homelessness, especially noticeable on the city streets and in green spaces where tents have been erected.

Many people can now afford &quot;second holidays&quot; and short breaks, resulting in increased tourism in British seaside towns. Many seaside towns have large shopping centres which also attract people from a wide area. Day trippers still come to the coastal towns, but on a more local scale than during the 19th century.

Many coastal towns are also popular retirement hotspots where older people reside permanently or take short breaks in the autumn months. Other English coastal towns have successfully sought to project a sense of their unique character. In particular, Southwold on the Suffolk coast is an active yet peaceful retirement haven with an emphasis on calmness, quiet countryside and jazz. Weymouth, Dorset offers itself as &quot;the gateway to the Jurassic Coast&quot;, Britain&#x27;s only natural World Heritage Site. Newquay in Cornwall offers itself as the &#x27;surfing capital of Britain&#x27;, hosting international surfing events on its shores.

Torbay in South Devon is known is also known as the English Riviera. Consisting of the towns of Torquay, Paignton with its pier and Brixham, the bay has 20 beaches and coves along its coastline, ranging from small secluded coves to the larger promenade-style seafronts of Torquay&#x27;s Torre Abbey Sands and Paignton Sands.

However, British seaside resorts have faced increasingly stiff competition from sunnier resorts overseas since the 1970s. Largely due to the falling price of air travel under the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher (elected in 1979), the number of British families who took holidays abroad rose significantly in the 1980s. The decline of British seaside resorts was discussed in the Morrissey song &quot;Everyday Is Like Sunday&quot; where daily life in the resort is likened to the emptiness of streets once associated with the shop closures on Sunday.

=== United States ===
With 3,800 miles (6100 km) of coastline, the US mainland has hundreds of seaside resorts on three coasts, Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Ocean. Unlike in many smaller countries, the seaside resorts in the US are located in various climate zones, with great differences in topography and environment. Many American seaside resorts are popular destination across the world, known for their climates, culture, and entertainment opportunities.

Seaside resorts in the United States first developed near the nation&#x27;s largest industrial cities on the upper East Coast, including New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. Cape May, New Jersey, part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area, and Provincetown, Massachusetts, part of the Boston metropolitan area were two of the nation&#x27;s first seaside resorts, developed in the 19th century and catering to city workers. Cape May is often called Americas &quot;first seaside resort&quot;. The early emergence of Cape May as a summer resort was due to easy transport by water from Philadelphia to the Atlantic Ocean. Early Cape May vacationers were carried to the town on sloops from Philadelphia, and water transport was also easy from New York, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and points south. The resort business in Cape May began to thrive when regular steamboat traffic on the Delaware River began after the War of 1812. Early visitors to Cape May included Henry Clay in 1847, and Abraham Lincoln in 1849. Today, the Cape May Historic District is one of the largest and well preserved examples of Victorian architecture in the United States.

On the southern Atlantic coast, Henry Flagler had the idea to make St. Augustine, Florida a winter resort. He built several rail lines south, and combined them with existing lines to create the Florida East Coast Railway in 1885. He built a railroad bridge over the St. Johns River in 1888, opening up the Atlantic coast of Florida to development. In 1887 Flagler began construction of two large ornate hotels in St. Augustine, the 540-room Ponce de Leon Hotel and the Hotel Alcazar, and bought the Casa Monica Hotel the next year.

In Miami, Florida, the community of Cocoanut (now Coconut) Grove began development as a resort town in the 1880s with the building of the Bayview House (aka Peacock Inn) which closed in 1902. Visitors to the greater Miami area then flocked to Camp Biscayne (in Coconut Grove), the Royal Palm Hotel in Downtown Miami, and other resort hotels in Miami, as well as in smaller numbers to the Florida Keys. In 1894, the lavish Royal Poinciana Hotel opened in Palm Beach, Florida, with rave reviews from wealthy New York tourists who picked oranges in January to their delight. On the Gulf of Mexico, the City of Galveston was emerging as a booming city, and in 1882, architect Nicholas J. Clayton designed the Beach Hotel. By 1888, Galveston, TX was a wealthy city and booming seaside playground for wealthy New Orleans businessmen.

On the Pacific coast in California, in April 1886, Babcock and Story created the Coronado Beach Company, which sought to develop Coronado as a seaside resort. In the mid-1880s, the San Diego region was in the midst of one of its first real estate booms. The Hotel del Coronado was built in March 1887, with Babcock&#x27;s visions for the hotel built around a courtyard of tropical trees, shrubs and flowers, with a dining wing to give full value to the view of the ocean, bay and city. By 1915, more hotels were built along the Los Angeles coastline to serve the wealthy tourists and Hollywood film makers. In May 1926, brothers E.A. &quot;Jack&quot; Harter and T.D. &quot;Til&quot; Harter built the Hotel Casa del Mar in Santa Monica, at a cost of $2 million, creating one of the most successful beach clubs in Southern California, popular with socialites and Hollywood celebrities.

In the 1920s, Carl Fisher was the main promoter of Miami Beach, and helped to develop the city as a seaside resort. To accommodate the wealthy tourists, several grand hotels were built, among them the Flamingo Hotel. In 1926, the massive The Breakers hotel in Palm Beach had been rebuilt, and there was a large northern tourist industry in coastal southern Florida. By the 1950s with increasing auto travel, more seaside resorts grew along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, while small, declining industrial ports were being rebuilt. In 1954, the Fontainebleau Miami Beach, and was considered, (at that time) the most lavish seaside hotel in the world.

In the modern era, hundreds of seaside resorts now string the Gulf, Atlantic, and Pacific coasts of the United States. Many Americans move with the seasons when they visit seaside resorts, vacationing in northern seaside areas in the warm season (April through October), and then moving to southern areas in the cold season (November through March). Many seaside resorts in Florida and California however, see travelers all year.

<text>Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) is the study of how people utilize technology collaboratively, often towards a shared goal. CSCW addresses how computer systems can support collaborative activity and coordination. More specifically, the field of CSCW seeks to analyze and draw connections between currently understood human psychological and social behaviors and available collaborative tools, or groupware. Often the goal of CSCW is to help promote and utilize technology in a collaborative way, and help create new tools to succeed in that goal. These parallels allow CSCW research to inform future design patterns or assist in the development of entirely new tools.

==History==
The origins of CSCW as a field are intertwined with the rise and subsequent fall of office automation as response to some of the criticisms, particularly the failure to address the impact human psychological and social behaviors can have. Greif and Cashman created the term CSCW to help employees seeking to further their work with technology. A few years later, in 1987, Charles Findley presented the concept of collaborative learning-work. Computer-supported cooperative work is an interdisciplinary research area of growing interest which relates workstations to digitally advanced networking systems. The first technologies were economically feasible, but their interoperability was lacking which makes understanding a well-tailored supporting system difficult. Due to global markets, more organizations are being pushed to decentralize their corporate systems. When faced with the complexities of today&#x27;s business issues, a significant effort must be made to improve manufacturing systems&#x27; efficiency, improve product quality, and reduce time to market.

The idea of CSCW or computer-supported cooperative work has become useful over the years since its inception and most especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures to mitigate the virus&#x27; spread led to firm closures and increased the rates of remote working and learning. People now share a common workspace, hold virtual meetings, see and hear each other&#x27;s movements and voices in a common virtual workspace with a group-centered design.

==Central concerns and concepts==
CSCW is a design-oriented academic field that is interdisciplinary in nature and brings together librarians, economists, organizational theorists, educators, social psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists and computer scientists, among others. The expertise of researchers in various and combined disciplines help researchers identify venues for possible development. Despite the variety of disciplines, CSCW is an identifiable research field focused on understanding characteristics of interdependent group work with the objective of designing adequate computer-based technology to support such cooperative work.

Essentially, CSCW goes beyond building technology itself and looks at how people work within groups and organizations, as well as the impacts of technology on those processes. CSCW has ushered in a great extent of melding between social scientists and computer scientists. These scientists work together to overcome both technical and non-technical problems within the same user spaces. For example, many R&amp;D professionals working with CSCW are computer scientists who have realized that social factors play an important role in the development of collaborative systems. On the flip side, many social scientists who understand the increasing role of technology in our social world become &quot;technologists&quot; who work in R&amp;D labs developing cooperative systems.
Over the years, CSCW researchers have identified a number of core dimensions of cooperative work. A non-exhaustive list includes:
* &quot;Awareness&quot;: individuals working together need to be able to gain some level of shared knowledge about each other&#x27;s activities.
* &quot;Articulation work&quot;: cooperating individuals must be able to partition work into units, divide it amongst themselves and, after the work is performed, reintegrate it.
* &quot;Appropriation&quot; (or tailorability): how an individual or group adapts a technology to their own particular situation; the technology may be appropriated in a manner completely unintended by the designers.

These concepts have largely been derived through the analysis of systems designed by researchers in the CSCW community, or through studies of existing systems (for example, Wikipedia). CSCW researchers that design and build systems try to address core concepts in novel ways. However, the complexity of a domain can make it difficult to produce conclusive results.

=== Articulation work ===
Articulation work is essentially the work that makes other work exist and possible. It is an effort made to make other work easier, more manageable, and can either be planned or unplanned. Therefore articulation work is an integral part of software process since software processes can sometimes fail or break down. Articulation work is also commonly known as &quot;invisible work&quot; since it is not always noticed. The concept was introduced by Anselm Strauss. He described it as a way to observe the &quot;nature of mutually dependent actors in their division of labour&quot;. It was introduced in CSCW by Schmidt and Bannon in 1992, where it would be applied to more realistic work scenarios in society. Articulation work is inherent in collaboration. The idea of articulation work was initially used in relation to computer-supported cooperative work, but it was travelled through other domains of work, such as healthcare. Initially, articulation work was known for scheduling and allocation of resources, but now, extends beyond that. Articulation work can also be seen as the response developers make to adapt to changes due to error or misjudgments in the real world. There are various models of articulation work that help identify applicable solutions to recover or reorganize planned activities. It is also important to note that it can vary depending on the scenario. Oftentimes there is an increase in the need for articulation work as the situation becomes more complex.

Because articulation work is so abstract, it can be split into two categories from the highest level: individual activity and collective activity.

* With individual activity, articulation work is almost always applicable. It is obvious that the subject is required to articulate his / her own work. But when a subject is faced with a new task, there are many questions that must be answered in order to move forward and be successful. This questioning is considered the articulation work to the actual project; invisible, but necessary. There is also articulation of action within an activity. For example, creating to-do lists and blueprints may be imperative to progressing a project. There is also articulation of operation within an action. In terms of software, the user must have adequate knowledge and skill in using computer systems and knowledge about software in order to perform tasks. 
* In a teamwork setting, articulation is imperative for collective activity. To maximize the efficiency of all the people working, the articulation work must be very solid. Without a solid foundation, the team is unable to collaborate effectively. Furthermore, as the size of the team increases, the articulation work becomes more complex.

What goes in between the user and the system is often overlooked. But software process modeling techniques as well as the model of articulation work is imperative in creating a solid foundation that allows for improvement and enhancement. In a way, all work needs to be articulated; there needs to be a who, what, where, when and how. With technology, there are many tools that utilize articulation work. Tasks such as planning and scheduling can be considered articulation work. There are also times when the articulation work is bridging the gap between the technology and the user. Ultimately, articulation work is the means that allows for cooperative work to be cooperative, a main objective of CSCW.

===Matrix===
One of the most common ways of conceptualizing CSCW systems is to consider the context of a system&#x27;s use. One such conceptualization is the CSCW Matrix, first introduced in 1988 by Johansen; it also appears in Baecker (1995). The matrix considers work contexts along two dimensions: whether collaboration is co-located or geographically distributed, and whether individuals collaborate synchronously (same time) or asynchronously (not depending on others to be around at the same time).

==== Same time/same place – face to face interaction ====
*Roomware
*Shared tables, wall displays
*Digital whiteboards
*Electronic meeting systems
*Single display groupware
*Group decision support system

==== Same time/different place – remote interaction ====

* Electronic meeting systems
* Videoconferencing
* Real-time groupware
* Messaging (instant messaging, email, chat)
* Telephoning

==== Different time/same place – continuous task (ongoing task) ====

* Team rooms
* Large displays
* Post-it
* War-rooms

==== Different time/different place – communication and coordination ====

* Electronic meeting systems
* Blogs
* Workflow
* Version control

This matrix is an outline of CSCW in different contexts, but it does have its limitations for users who are beginners at understanding CSCW. For example, there is a collaborative mode called multi-synchronous that can not fit the matrix. As the field evolves whether by new social standards or technological development, the simple matrix cannot describe all of CSCW and fields of research within.

=== Model of Coordinated Action (MoCA) ===
The Model of Coordinated Action, as a framework for analyzing group collaboration, identifies several dimensions of common features of cooperative work that extend beyond the CSCW matrix and allow for more complexity in describing how teams work given certain conditions. The seven total dimensions that constitute the model (MoCA) are used to describe essential &quot;fields of action&quot; seen in existing CSCW research. Rather than existing as a rigid matrix with distinct quadrants, this model is to be interpreted as multidimensional – each dimension existing as its own continuum. These ends of these dimensions&#x27; continuums are defined in the following subsections.

==== Synchronicity ====
This is pertaining to the time at which the collaborative work occurs. This could range from live meetings conducted at exact times to viewing recordings or responding to messages that do not require one or all participants to be active at the time the recording, message, or other deliverable was created.

==== Physical distribution ====
This covers the distance in which team members could be geographically separated while still being able to collaborate. The least physically distributed cooperative work is a meeting in which all team members are physically present in the same space and communicating verbally, face-to-face. Conversely, technology now allows for more distanced communication that could extend as far as meeting from multiple countries.

==== Scale ====
The scale of a collaborative project refers to how many individuals comprise the project team. As the number of people involved increases, the division of tasks must become more intricate and complex to ensure that each participant is contributing in some way.

==== Number of communities of practice ====
A community of practice refers to a group of individuals with shared, common knowledge of a specific subject. This group may be composed of both newcomers and experts. New members will gain knowledge through exposure and immersion and become experts as newer members join, thus expanding the community of practice over time. These groups can be as specific or as broad as their members feel is necessary, as no two people have the same set of knowledge and diversification of perspectives is common.

==== Nascence ====
Some collaborative projects are designed to be more long-lasting than others, often meaning that their standard practices and actions are more established than newer, less developed projects. Synonymous with &quot;newness&quot;, nascence refers to how established a cooperative effort is at a given point in time. While most work is always developing in some way, newer projects will have to spend more time establishing common ground among its team members and will thus have a higher level of nascence.

==== Planned permanence ====
This dimension encourages teams to establish common practices, terminology, etc. within the group to ensure cohesion and understanding among the work. It is difficult to gauge how long a project will last, therefore establishing these foundations in early stages helps to prevent confusion between group members at later stages when there may be higher stakes or deeper investigation. The notion of planned permanence is essential to the model as it allows for productive communication between individuals who may have different expertise or are members of different communities of practice.

==== Turnover ====
This dimension is used to describe the rate at which individuals leave a collaborative group. Such events may occur at various rates depending on the impact one&#x27;s departure may have on the individual and the group. In a well-established collaborative action or a group with a small scale, a team member leaving may have detrimental effects, whereas temporary projects with open membership may have high turnover rates covered by the project&#x27;s high scale. Crowdsourcing, such as the means by which Wikipedia creates its articles, are an example of an entity with high turnover rates (e.g. a Wikipedian contributes only to one article at one time) that does not face impactful consequences due to the high scale of the collaborative work.

=== Considerations for interaction design ===

==== Self-presentation ====

Self-presentation has been studied in traditional face-to-face environments, but as society has embraced content culture, social platforms have generated new affordances for presenting oneself online. Due to technological growth, social platforms, and their increased affordances, society has reconfigured the way users self-present online due to audience input and context collapse.

In an online setting, audiences are physically invisible which complicates the users ability to distinguish their intended audience. Audience input, on social platforms, can range from commenting, sharing, liking, tagging, etc. For example, LinkedIn is a platform who encourages commentary where positive feedback outweighs negative feedback on topics including career announcements. Conversely, audience input can be unwarranted which can lead to real-life implications, especially for marginalized groups who are prone to both warranted and unwarranted commentary on public posts.

Context collapse is when separate audiences join together and make curated content for an audience which is visible to unintended audiences. The likelihood of context collapse is especially challenging with the surge of proprietary software which introduces a conflict of interest for the users who have an ideal audience, but the platforms algorithm has a differing one. Collapsed context influences self-presentation when previously separate audiences are merged into one.

==== Affordance ====
As media platforms proliferate, so do the affordances offered that directly influence how users manage their self-presentation. According to researchers, the three most influential affordances on how users present themselves in an online domain include anonymity, persistence, and visibility.

Anonymity in the context of social media refers to the separation of an individual&#x27;s online and offline identity by making the origin of their messages unspecified. Platforms that support anonymity have users that are more likely to depict their offline self accurately online (i.e Reddit). Comparatively, platforms with less constraints on anonymity are subject to users that portray their online and offline selves differently, thus creating a &quot;persona&quot;. Facebook, for example, requires its users to abide by its &quot;real-name&quot; policy, further connecting their offline and online identities. Furthermore, being able to unequivocally associate an online persona to a real-life human contributes to how users present themselves online honestly.

Platforms which have &quot;content persistence&quot; store content so it may be accessed at a later point in time. Platforms including Instagram and Facebook are highly persistent with their ability to make content available until deleted. Whereas, Snapchat has lower persistence because content is ephemeral causing users to post content that represents their offline self more accurately. This affordance strongly affects users&#x27; self-presentation management because they recognize content can be openly accessed on platforms that are highly persistent.
On social platforms, visibility is created when information is acquired with search of a word or phrase or even topic name, an example being a hashtag. When content is visible, users become aware of their self-presentation and will adjust accordingly. However, some platforms give their users leverage in specifying how visible their content is, thus affording for visibility control. For example Snapchat and Instagram both allow users to build a &quot;close friends list&quot; and block specific people from viewing content. Nonetheless, intended audiences are never guaranteed. Facebook is an example of a platform that shares content to both primary (e.g. direct friends) and secondary viewers (e.g. friends of friends). The concern of visibility with Facebook&#x27;s algorithm is notably challenging for marginalized groups because of such blurred visibility mechanisms. In addition, users face privacy concerns relative to visibility given the current era of screenshotting.

=== Boundary object ===

A boundary object is an informational item which is used differently by various communities or fields of study and may be a concrete, physical item or an abstract concept.

Examples of boundary objects include:

* Most research libraries, as different research groups may use different resources from the same libraries.
* An interdisciplinary research project, as different business sectors and research groups may have different goals for the project.
* The outline of a U.S. state&#x27;s boundaries, which may be drawn on a roadmap for travelers or on an ecological map for biologists.

In computer-supported cooperative work, boundary objects are typically used to study how information and tools are transmitted between different cultures or communities.

Some examples of boundary objects in CSCW research are:

* Electronic health records, which pass health information between groups with different priorities (such as doctors, nurses, and medical secretaries).
* The concept of a &quot;digital work environment&quot;, as used in Swedish political debate.

=== Standardization vs. flexibility in CSCW ===
Standardization is defined as &quot;agile processes that are enforced as a standard protocol across an organization to share knowledge and best practice.&quot; Flexibility, on the other hand, is the &quot;ability to customize and evolve processes to suit the aims of an agile team&quot;.

As CSCW tools, standardization and flexibility are almost mutually exclusive from each other. In CSCW, flexibility comes in two forms, flexibility for future change, and flexibility for interpretation. Everything that is done on the internet has a level of standardization due to the internet standards. In fact, Email has its own set of standards, of which the first draft was created in 1977. No CSCW tool is perfectly flexible, and all lose flexibility in the same three levels. Either flexibility is lost when the programmer makes the toolkit, when the programmer makes the application, and/or when the user uses the application.

==== Standardization in information infrastructure ====
Information infrastructure requires extensive standardization to make collaboration work. Since data is transferred from company to company and occasionally nation to nation, international standards have been put in place to make communication of data much simpler. Often one company&#x27;s data will be included in a much larger system, and this would become almost impossible without standardization. With information infrastructure, there is very little flexibility in potential future changes. Due to the fact that the standards have been around for decades and there are hundreds of them, it is nearly impossible to change one standard without greatly affecting the others.

==== Flexibility in toolkits ====
Creating CSCW toolkits requires flexibility of interpretation; it is important that these tools are generic and can be used in many different ways. Another important part of a toolkit&#x27;s flexibility is the extensibility, the extent to which new components or tools can be created using the tools provided. An example of a toolkit that is flexible in how generic the tools are is Oval. Oval consists of four components: objects, views, agents, and links. This toolkit was used to recreate four previously existing communication systems: The Coordinator, gIBIS, Lotus Notes, and Information Lens. It proved that, due to its flexibility, Oval was able to create many forms of peer-to-peer communication applications.

== Applications ==

=== Applications in education ===
There have been three main generations to distance education, starting with the first being through postal service, the second through mass media such as the radio, television, and films, and the third being the current state of e-learning. Technology-enhanced learning, or &quot;e-learning&quot;, has been an increasingly relevant topic in education, especially with the development of the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused many schools to switch to remote learning. E-learning is defined as &quot;the use of technology to support and enhance learning practice&quot;. It includes the utilization of many different types of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and is limited to the use of intranet and internet in the teaching and learning process. The development of content is mainly through using learning objectives to create activities through Virtual Learning Environments, Content Management Systems, and Learning Management Systems. These technologies have created massive change in their use as CSCW tools, allowing students and teachers to work on the same platforms and have a shared online space in which to communicate in. The delivery of content can be either asynchronous, such as email and discussion forums, or synchronous, like through chat or video conferencing. Synchronous education allows for much more equal interaction between students and instructors and better communication between students for the facilitation of group projects and assignments.

==== Community of inquiry framework ====
E-learning has been explained by the community of inquiry (COI) framework introduced by Garrison et al. In this framework, there are three major elements: cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence.

* Cognitive presence in this framework is the measure of how well meaning is able to be constructed from the content being taught. It assumes that students have access to a large network from which to gain information from. This includes peers, instructors, alumni, and practicing professionals. E-learning has allowed this network to be easily accessible through the internet, and these connections can be made synchronously through video, audio, or texts.
* Social presence in the community of inquiry framework is how well participants can connect with one another on a social level and present themselves as &quot;real people&quot;. Video conferencing has been shown to increase social presence within students. One study found that &quot;social presence in VC [Virtual Conferencing] can have a positive effect on group efficacy and performance by amplifying group cohesion&quot;. This information is greatly useful in designing future systems because it explains the importance of technology like video conferencing in synchronous e-learning. Groups that are able to see each other face to face have a stronger bond and are able to complete tasks faster than those without it. Increasing the social presence in online education environments helps facilitate in the understanding of the content and the ability for the group to solve problems.
* Teaching presence in the COI framework contains two main functions: creation of content and the facilitation of this content. The creation of content is usually done by the instructor, but students and instructors can share the role of facilitator, especially in higher education settings. The goal of teaching presence is &quot;to support and enhance social and cognitive presence for the purpose of realizing educational outcome&quot;.

Virtual educational software and tools are becoming more readily used globally. Remote educational platforms and tools must be accessible for various generations, including children as well as guardians or teachers, yet these frameworks are not adapted to be child-friendly. The lack of interface and design consideration for younger users causes difficulty in potential communication between children and older generations utilizing the software. This in turn leads to a decrease in virtual learning participation as well as potential diminished collaboration with peers. In addition, it may be difficult for older teachers to utilize such technology, and communicate with their students. Similar to orienting older workers with CSCW tools, it is difficult to train younger students or older teachers in utilizing virtual technology, and may not be possible for widely spread virtual classrooms and learning environments.

=== Applications in gaming ===
Collaborative mixed reality games modify the shared social experience, during which players can interact in real-time with physical and virtual gaming environments and with other multiplayer video gamers. This may be done through any means of communication, self-representation, and collaboration.

==== Communication systems ====
The group members experience effective communication practices following the availability of a common platform for expressing opinions and coordinating tasks. The technology is applicable not only in professional contexts but also in the gaming world. CSCW usually offers synchronous and asynchronous games to allow multiple individuals to compete in a certain activity across social networks. Thus, the tool has made gaming more interesting by facilitating group activities in real-time and widespread social interactions beyond geographical boundaries.

==== Self-presentation ====
HCI, CSCW, and game studies in MMORPGs highlight the importance of avatar-mediated self-presentation in player experience. These studies have put together known two components of self-presentation in games. First, through personal choice and personalization of avatars, various social values (such as gender roles and social norms) are integrated and reflected in the player&#x27;s self-image. Second, self-presentation in games conjointly options experimentation of fully new identities or reaffirmation of existing identities. This includes cross-gender play and queerness gameplay. Computer-mediated communication in gaming settings takes place across different channels, which can consist of structured message systems, bulletin boards, meeting rooms, and shared diaries. As such, the players can hold conversations while proceeding with the game to create a lively experience. Thus, the features of video games offer a platform for users to openly express themselves.

==== Collaborations and game design in multi-user video games ====
The most collaborative and socially interactive aspect of a video game is the online communities. Popular video games often have various social groups for their diverse community of players. For example, in the quest-based multiplayer game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, the most collaborative and socially interactive aspect of the game are the &quot;Guilds&quot;, which are alliances of individuals with whom players must join forces. By incorporating Guilds, World of Warcraft creates opportunities for players to work together with their team members who can be from anywhere in the world. WOW players who are associated with a Guild are more likely to play and do quests with the same Guild mates each time which develops a strong bond between players and a sense of community. These bonds and friendships formed from playing with Guild mates, not only improves collaboration within the game, it also creates a sense of belonging and community which is one of the most important attribute of online gaming communities.

When it comes to designing a multi-user collaborative game, it involves positive interdependence, personal accountability, and social skills. Positive Interdependence is the dependence of collaboration from members of a group in order to accomplish a task. In video games, this is the idea of players on a team or in a group understanding that working together is beneficial, and that the success and failure of the group is shared equally if all members participate. An example of including a positive interdependence aspect to a video game is creating a common shared goal for the team to increase collaboration. The next guideline is personal accountability, which is the idea that each individual in a group must put forth their best effort for the team&#x27;s overall success. Personal accountability might be incorporated into video games by including an incentive system where individual players are rewarded with additional points for completing an objective or an action that improves the team&#x27;s chances of success. The final guideline, social skills, is the most important to consider when designing a collaborative game. An example of developing player social skills through a video game can be creating in-game situations where players have to assign roles, plan, and execute to solve the problem. By following these guidelines, game makers can create gaming-environments which encourage collaboration and social interaction between players.

=== Applications of mobile devices ===
Mobile devices are generally more accessible than their non-mobile counterparts, with about 41% of the world&#x27;s population as per a survey from 2019 owning a mobile device. This coupled with their relative ease of transport makes mobile devices usable in a large variety of settings which other computing devices would not function as well. Because of this, mobile devices make videoconferencing and texting possible in a variety of settings which would not be accessible without such a device.

The Chinese social media platform WeChat has is utilized to facilitate communication between patients and doctors. WeChat is able to enhance healthcare interactions between patient and doctor by allowing direct communication of the patient&#x27;s symptoms.

=== Applications in social media ===
Social media tools and platforms have expanded virtual communication amongst various generations. However, with older individuals being less comfortable with CSCW tools, it is difficult to design social platforms that account for both older and younger generational social needs.

Often, these social systems focus key functionality and feature creation for younger demographics, causing issues in adaptability for older generations. In addition, with the lack of scalability for these features, the tools are not able to adapt to fit evolutional needs of generations as they age. With the difficulty for older demographics to adopt these intergenerational virtual platforms, the risk of social isolation is increased in them.

While systems have been created specifically for older generations to communicate amongst one another, system design frameworks are not complex enough to lend to intergenerational communication.

=== Applications to ubiquitous computing ===

Along the lines of a more collaborative modality is something called ubiquitous computing. Ubiquitous computing was first coined by Mark Weiser of Xerox PARC. This was to describe the phenomenon of computing technologies becoming prevalent everywhere. A new language was created to observe both the dynamics of computers becoming available at mass scale and its effects on users in collaborative systems. Between the use of social commerce apps, the rise of social media, and the widespread availability of smart devices and the Internet, there is a growing area of research within CSCW that how come out of these three trends. These topics include ethnomethodology and conversation analysis (EMCA) within social media, ubiquitous computing, and instant message based social commerce.

==== Ethnomethodology and synchronicity ====
In &quot;You Recommend I Buy: How and Why People Engage in Instant Messaging Based Social Commerce&quot;, researchers on this project analyzed twelve users of Chinese Instant Messenger (IM) social commerce platforms to study how social recommendation engines on IM commerce platforms result in a different user experience. The study was entirely on Chinese platforms, mainly WeChat. The research was conducted by a team composed of members from Stanford, Beijing, Boston, and Kyoto. The interviewing process took place in the winter of 2020 and was an entirely qualitative analysis, using just interviews. The goal of the interviews were to probe about how participants got involved in IM based social commerce, their experience on IM based social commerce, the reasons for and against IM based social commerce, and changes introduced by IM based social commerce to their lives. An IM-based service integrates directly with more intimate social experiences. Essentially, IM is real-time texting over a network. This can be both a synchronous or asynchronous activity. IM based social commerce makes the user shopping experience more accessible. In terms of CSCW, this is an example of ubiquitous computing. This creates a &quot;jump out of the box&quot; experience as described in the research because the IM based platform facilitates a change in user behavior and the overall experience on social commerce. The benefit of this concept is that the app is leveraging personal relationships and real-life networks that can actually lead to a more meaningful customer experience, which is founded upon trust.

==== Embeddedness ====
A second CSCW paper, &quot;Embeddedness and Sequentiality in Social Media&quot;, explores a new methodology for analyzing social media—another expression of ubiquitous computing in CSCW. This paper used ethnomethodology and conversation analysis (EMCA) as a framework to research Facebook users. In brief, ethnomethodology studies the everyday interactions of people and relates how this pertains to forming their outlook of the world. Conversational analysis delves into the structures of conversations so as to extract information about how people construct their experiences. The team behind this research, hailing from University of Nottingham and Stockholm University, recognized that &quot;moment-by-moment, unfolding, real-time human action&quot; was somewhat missing from the CSCW literature on social media. The significance of this is they felt that by exploring EMCA, it could provide different insights on collaborative social network systems, as opposed to relying solely on recall. Here is a formal definition for EMCA:For EMCA, the activities of everyday life are structured in time—some things routinely happen before others. Fundamentally there is a &#x27;sequentiality&#x27; to activity, something that has been vital for developing understanding of the orderly nature of talk and bodily interaction.In other words, EMCA pays attention to the sequence of events, so as to reveal some sort of underlying order about our behavior in our day-to-day interactions. In the bigger picture, this work reveals that time, as one of the dimensions to consider within collaborative systems design, matters. Another major factor would be distance. &quot;Does Distance Still Matter? Revisiting the CSCW Fundamentals on Distributed Collaboration&quot; is another research article that, as the title suggests, explores under what circumstances distance matters. Most notably, it mentions the &quot;mutual knowledge problem.&quot; This problem arises when a group in a distributed collaborative system experiences a breakdown in communication due to the fact that its members lack a shared understanding for the given context they are working in. According to the article, it matters that everyone is in alignment over the nature of what they are doing.

==== Co-located, parallel and sequential activities ====
The solutions of unresolved issues in ubiquitous computing systems can be explored now that the observations of user experiences in social media, which are normally based on recollection, are no longer needed. Some of the unresolved questions include: &quot;How does social media start being used, stop being used? When is it being used, and how is that usage ordered and integrated into other, parallel activities at the time?&quot;

Parallel activities refer to occurrences in co-located groupware and ubiquitous computing technologies like social media. Examining these sequential and parallel activities in user groups on social media networks enables the ability to &quot;[manage] the experience of that everyday life.&quot; An important takeaway from this paper on EMCA and sequentiality is that it reveals how the choices made by designers of social media apps ultimately mediates our end-user experience, for better or for worse. It reveals: &quot;when content is posted and sequentially what is associated with it.&quot;

==== Ubiquitous computing infrastructures ====

On the topic of computing infrastructures, &quot;Democratizing Ubiquitous Computing – a Right for Locality&quot; presents a study from researchers at Lancaster University on ubiquitous computing (&quot;ubicomp&quot;) to identify where there exists positive or negative effects on users and society at large. The research specifically focuses on cities or urban areas as they are places where one can expect a lot of technological and social activities to take place. An apparent guiding principle to the research is that the goal of advancing any ubicomp technologies should be to maximize the amount of good to as many people in a society as possible. A key observation is made about the way in which these infrastructures come into being:A ubiquitous computing infrastructure can play an important role in enabling and enhancing beneficial social processes as, unlike electricity, digital infrastructure enhances a society&#x27;s cognitive power by its ability to connect people and information [39]. While infrastructure projects in the past had the idealistic notion to connect the urban realm and its communities of different ethnicity, wealth, and beliefs, Graham et al. [28] note the increasing fragmentation of the management and ownership of infrastructures. This is because ubicomp has the potential to further disadvantage marginalized communities online.The current disadvantage of ubiquitous computing infrastructures is that they do not best support urban development. Proposals to resolve these social issues include increased transparency about personal data collection as well as individual and community accountability about the data collection process in ubicomp infrastructure. &quot;Data at work: supporting sharing in science and engineering&quot; is one such paper that goes into greater depth about how to build better infrastructures that enable open data-sharing and thus, empower its users. What this article outlines is that in building better collaborative systems that advance science and society, we are, by effect, &quot;promoting sharing behaviors&quot; that will encourage greater cooperation and more effective outcomes.

Essentially, ubiquitous computing will reflect society and the choices it makes will influence those computing systems that are put in place. Ubiquitous computing is huge to the field of CSCW because as the barriers between physical boundaries that separate us break down with the adoption of technology, our relationships to those locations is actually strengthened. However, there remains few potential challenges when it comes to social collaboration and the workplace.

==Challenges==

=== Social – technical gap ===
The success of CSCW systems is often so contingent on the social context that it is difficult to generalize. Consequently, CSCW systems that are based on the design of successful ones may fail to be appropriated in other seemingly similar contexts for a variety of reasons that are nearly impossible to identify &quot;a priori&quot;. CSCW researcher Mark Ackerman calls this &quot;divide between what we know we must support socially and what we can support technically&quot; the social-technical gap and describes CSCW&#x27;s main research agenda to be &quot;exploring, understanding, and hopefully ameliorating&quot; this gap.

It is important to analyze &#x27;what we know we must support socially&#x27; for a few reasons. The way interaction takes place within an in-person setting is something that cannot be easily changed unlike the way technology is able to be manipulated to fit specific needs today. There are certain norms and standards lived up to within peoples&#x27; day to day lives, a certain part of those norms and attitudes carry over into the online world. The problem is mimicking daily communication styles and behavior into an online setting. Schmidt examines this concept within &quot;Mind the Gap&quot;, he states &quot;Cooperative work is a tricky phenomenon. We are all engaged in cooperative activities of various sorts in our everyday lives and routinely observe others working together around us. We are all experts from our everyday experience. And yet this quotidian insight can be utterly misleading when applied to the design of systems to support cooperative work&quot;. Though in-person communication on a day-to-day basis is natural for most, it does not easily translate over into cooperative work. This highlights the need for adaptability within CSCW systems, Schmidt expands on the &quot;crucial requirement of flexibility that arises from the changing needs of the cooperative work setting&quot;. These all tie together to highlight the gaps within CSCW.

===Leadership===
Generally, teams working in a CSCW environment need the same types of leadership as non-CSCW teams. However, research has shown that distributed CSCW teams may need more direction at the time the group is formed than traditional working groups, largely to promote cohesion and liking among people who may not have as many opportunities to interact in person, both before and after the formation of the working group.

===Adoption of groupware===

Groupware goes hand in hand with CSCW. The term refers to software that is designed to support activities of a group or organization over a network and includes email, conferencing tools, group calendars, workflow management tools, etc.

While groupware enables geographically dispersed teams to achieve organizational goals and engage in cooperative work, there are also many challenges that accompany use of such systems. For instance, groupware often requires users to learn a new system, which users may perceive as creating more work for them without much benefit. If team members are not willing to learn and adopt groupware, it is highly difficult for the organization to develop the requisite critical mass for the groupware to be useful. Further, research has found that groupware requires careful implementation into a group setting, and product developers have not as yet been able to find the most optimal way to introduce such systems into organizational environments.

On the technical side, networking issues with groupware often create challenges in using groupware for CSCW. While access to the Internet is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, geographically dispersed users still face challenges of differing network conditions. For instance, web conferencing can be quite challenging if some members have a very slow connection and others are able to utilize high speed connections.

=== Intergenerational groups ===
Adapting CSCW tools for intergenerational groups is a prevalent issue within all forms of CSCW. Different generations have different feelings towards technology as well as different ways to utilize technology. However, as technology has become integral to everyday tasks, it must be accessible to all generations of people. With cooperative work becoming increasingly important and diversified, virtual interaction between different generations is also expanding. Given this, many fields that utilize CSCW tools require carefully designed frameworks to account for different generations.

==== Workplace teams ====
One of the recurring challenges in CSCW environments is development of an infrastructure that can bridge cross-generational gaps in virtual teams.

Many companies rely on communication and collaboration between intergenerational employees to be successful, and often this collaboration is performed using various software and technologies. These team-driven groupware platforms range from email and daily calendars to version control platforms, task management software, and more. These tools must be accessible to workplace teams virtually, with remote work becoming more commonplace.

Ideally, system designs will accommodate all team members, but orienting older workers to new CSCW tools can often be difficult. This can cause problems in virtual teams due to the necessity of incorporating the wealth of knowledge and expertise that older workers bring to the table with the technological challenges of new virtual environments. Orienting and retraining older workers to effectively utilize new technology can often be difficult, as they generally have less experience than younger workers with learning such new technologies.

As older workers delay their retirement and re-enter the workforce, teams are becoming increasingly intergenerational, meaning that the creation of effective intergenerational CSCW frameworks for virtual environments is essential.

====Tools in CSCW====
Collaboration amongst peers has always been an integral aspect to getting something done. Working together not only eases the difficulty of the task at hand, but leads to more effective work that is accomplished. As computers and technology become increasingly important in everyday lives, communication skills change as technology allows individuals to stay connected across many previous barriers. Barriers to communication might have been the end of the work day, being across the country or even slow applications that are more of a hindrance than an aid. With new collaborative tools that have been tried and tested, these previous barriers to communication have been shattered and replaced with new tools that help progress collaboration. Tools that have been integral in shaping computer supported cooperative work can be split into two major categories: communication and organization.

* Communication: The ability to communicate with others while working is a luxury that has increased the speed and accuracy at which tasks are accomplished. Individuals can also send pictures of code and issues through platforms like Microsoft Teams without anyone needing to change screen monitors. This particular change increased office productivity and communication by almost half. The ability to send more specific information faster gave the employees the ability to get more done with also much less effort for themselves. Tools like Microsoft Teams and Slack also allow people to collaborate with ease even if they are in different time zones or different geographical areas. This means that work is no longer tied to specific offices at a 9 to 5 job, but can be done anywhere because you have the ability to communicate with one or groups of people on a large scale.
* Organization: Apps such as iCal and Reminders on the iPhone provide time-oriented structure and remind users of the tasks they must complete. Organization and communication go hand in hand with one another, as they help individuals better plan their day because apps warn them when two events overlap, a due date approaches, or whether there is time available for an event. There is reduced hassle to daily scheduling and group coordination. Such apps usually tie into different electronic devices such as computers and tablets, therefore people receive reminders across multiple platforms. If the platform permits, individuals in teams can set reminders for other people.

=== Departmental conflicts ===
==== Cross-boundary breakdowns ====
Cross-boundary breakdowns are when different departments of the same organization unintentionally harm other. They may be caused by failures to coordinate activities across multiple departments, a form of articulation work.

Hospitals may experience cross-boundary breakdowns during patient transfers. When a patient is sent from the emergency department to the operation room, the inpatient access department (IPA) must normally be notified, allowing them to track the number and location of available ICU beds. However, when the emergency department fails to notify the IPA, the IPA staff are later unable to find suitable beds for patients.

==== Re-coordinating activities ====
To restore useful communication between departments after a cross-boundary breakdown, organizations may perform re-coordinating activities.

Hospitals may respond to cross-boundary breakdowns by explicitly ranking key resources or assigning &quot;integrator&quot; roles to multiple staff members across different departments.

=== Challenges in research ===
====Differing meanings====
In the CSCW field, researchers rely on a variety of sources that include journals and research schools of thought. These different sources may lead to disagreement and confusion, as there are terms in the field that can be used in different contexts (&quot;user&quot;, &quot;implementation&quot;, etc.) User requirements change over time and are often not clear to participants due to their evolving nature and the fact that requirements are always in flux.

====Identifying user needs====
CSCW researchers often have difficulty deciding which set(s) of tools will benefit a particular group because of the nuances within organizations. This is exacerbated by the fact that it is challenging to accurately identify user/group/organization needs and requirements, since such needs and requirements inevitably change through the introduction of the system itself. When researchers study requirements multiple times, the requirements themselves often change and evolve once the researchers have completed a particular iteration.

====Evaluation and measurement====
The range of disciplinary approaches leveraged in implementing CSCW systems makes CSCW difficult to evaluate, measure, and generalize to multiple populations. Because researchers evaluating CSCW systems often bypass quantitative data in favor of naturalistic inquiry, results can be largely subjective due to the complexity and nuances of organizations themselves. Possibly as a result of the debate between qualitative and quantitative researchers, three evaluation approaches have emerged in the literature examining CSCW systems. However, each approach faces its own unique challenges and weaknesses:
== Diversity, equity, and inclusion ==

=== Gender ===
In computer-supported cooperative work, there are small psychological differences between how men and women approach CSCW programs. This can lead to unintentionally biased systems, due to the majority of software being designed and tested by men. As well, in systems where societal gender differences are not accounted for and countered, men tend to overrepresent women in these online spaces. This can lead to women feeling potentially alienated and unfairly targeted by CSCW programs.

In recent years, more studies have been conducted on how men and women interact with each other using CSCW systems. Findings do not indicate that men and women have performance difference when performing CSCW tasks, but rather that each gender approaches and interacts with software and performs CSCW tasks differently. In most findings, men were more likely to explore potential choices and willing to take risks compared to women. In group tasks, women in general were more conservative in voicing their opinions and suggestions on tasks when paired with a male, but inversely were very communicative when paired with another woman. As well, men are found to be more likely to take control of group activities and teamwork, even from a young age, leading to further ostracizing of women speaking up in CSCW group work. Additionally, in CSCW message boards, men on average posted more messages and engaged more frequently than their female counterparts.

==== Increasing female participation ====
The dynamic of women in the workforce not participating as much is less of a CSCW problem and is prevalent in all workspaces, but software can still be designed to increase female participation in CSCW. In software design, women are more likely to be involved if software is designed to center communication and cooperation. This is one possible method to increasing female participation, and it does not address why CSCW has lower female participation in the first place.

In a study, women generally rated themselves as being poor at understanding technology, having difficulty at using mobile programs, and disliked using CSCW software. However, when asked these same questions about specific software in general, they rated themselves just as strongly as the men in the study did. This lack of confidence in software as a whole impacts women&#x27;s ability to efficiently and effectively use online programs compared to men, and accounts for some of the difficulties women face in using CSCW software.

Despite being an active area of research since the 1990s, many developers often do not take gender differences into account when designing their CSCW systems. These issues compound on top of the cultural problems mentioned previously, and lead to further difficulties for women in CSCW. By enabling developers to be more aware of the differences and difficulties facing women in CSCW design, women can be more effective users of CSCW systems through sharing and voicing opinions.

==Conferences==

Since 2010, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has hosted a yearly conference on CSCW, &quot;The ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work&quot;. The conference is sponsored by the SIGCHI special interest group. The CSCW conference was held bianually from 1986 to 2010 and annually thereafter. By 2010, CSCW researchers were observing that the name &quot;Computer Supported Cooperative Work&quot; no longer reflected the work done in the field. As a result of those debates, the conference would expand its name to &quot;CSCW &amp; Social Computing&quot;, incorporating the reality of social computing research within CSCW as a field. The conference is currently held in October or November and features research in the design and use of technologies that affect organizational and group work. With the development of new devices that allow collaboration from different locations and contexts, CSCW includes researchers from both academia and industry to discuss virtual collaboration from both social and technical perspectives. 

Internationally, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) sponsors the International Conference on Computer Supported Work in Design, which takes place yearly. In addition, the European Society for Socially Embedded Technologies sponsors the European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, which has been held every two years since 1989. CSCW panels are a regular component of conferences of the adjacent field of science and technology studies.

<doc id="293993" wikidata="Q5520020" url="?curid=293993" title="Gamelan degung">
<text>Gamelan degung is a form of Sundanese musical ensemble that uses a subset of modified gamelan instruments with a particular mode of &quot;degung&quot; scale. The instruments are manufactured under local conditions in towns in West Java such as Bogor and Bandung. &quot;Degung&quot; music is often played at public gatherings in West Java, such as at local elections, as well as many other events. There is international interest in &quot;degung&quot; as well among communities in other countries interested in Indonesian and gamelan music.

Gamelan degung also playable in &quot;madenda&quot; scale, which is included in the set as a complementary tone, usually marked as a -3/&quot;ni&quot; tone in the set. Playing gamelan degung in this scale requires the substitution of the 3/&quot;na&quot; metal bars into -3/&quot;ni&quot; tones on all instruments.
== Instruments ==
The instrumentation of &quot;gamelan degung&quot; is quite flexible. It may include:

* &quot;Bonang/kolènang&quot;: two rows of seven small bulbous gongs. It differs from its Javanese counterpart in that the rows are each placed on either side of the player.
* &quot;saron/peking&quot;: a high-pitched bronze metallophone with fourteen keys. Usually, there are two sarons in a single set.
* &quot;panerus&quot;: another bronze metallophone, similar to the &quot;peking&quot; but pitched an octave lower.
* &quot;Jengglong&quot;: six bulbous gongs suspended from the same frame. Could be played like bonang, or hanged.
* &quot;goong ageung&quot;: a large gong.
* &quot;Pancer: a smaller gong, secondary gong.
* A set of &quot;kendang&quot;, consisting of one large (&quot;kendang indung&quot;) and two small double-sided drums (&quot;kulantér&quot;).
* &quot;Suling degung&quot;: a four-holed bamboo flute.
* &quot;Suling kawih&quot;: a six-holed bamboo flute, interchangeably used with suling degung
* &quot;Gambang&quot;: a wooden xylophone.
* &quot;Kacapi&quot;: a zither.

In classical &quot;degung&quot;, the &quot;bonang&quot; serves as a conductor for the whole ensemble. Except in certain modern compositions, it is rarely absent.

<text>Benidorm ( , , ) is a municipality in the province of Alicante, Valencian Community, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.

Known as the “New York of the Mediterranean”, Benidorm has been a tourist destination within Spain since 1925, when its port was extended and the first hotels were built, though it would not be until the 1950s that it became renowned as a summer destination for people coming from inland Spain, especially Madrid. Today it is known for its hotel industry, beaches, and skyscrapers and receives as many tourists from abroad as from Spain. According to the 2020 census, Benidorm has a permanent population of 70,450 inhabitants, making it the fifth-most populous town in the Alicante province and the ninth in Valencian Community.

== History ==
It is thought there were settlements in the Benidorm area possibly as far back as 3000 BC, including evidence of Roman and Punic remains. However, settlements in the area were small and it was not until the arrival of the Arabs that the local population began to grow during the era of the Umayyad dynasty. The Christian King James I of Aragon conquered the region in 1245, and Benidorm first officially became known in 1325, when Admiral Bernat de Sarrià of Polop awarded it a town charter as a way of removing the Moors and allowing Christians to inhabit the area. Strategically, the town was also used by Bernat de Sarrià to stop the rising power of Admiral Roger of Lauria, lord of Altea, in the south of the Kingdom of Valencia.

Benidorm&#x27;s history for the next few centuries was plagued by attacks from the sea by Ottoman and Barbary pirates. The 17th century saw conditions improve for Benidorm and its people, most notably with the construction of an advanced irrigation system in 1666 to channel water to the region. By the 18th century Benidorm fishermen had become famous and sought after all over Spain and beyond. Tuna was their main catch and they perfected the ancient almadraba technique dating from Islamic times. The success of the fishing industry, together with improved local agriculture, helped to fuel a strong local economy. Coastal traffic increased too, bringing more wealth to the region with the town becoming a base for sea captains and the building of their vessels.

In 1952, Benidorm&#x27;s fishing industry went into decline; this was a factor in encouraging the town council to approve many new development plans aimed at the tourist market.

In 2018, Benidorm became the first city to achieve the UNE178501 Smart Tourism certification, Its &quot;Benidorm, Destino Turístico Inteligente y Sostenible&quot; plan (2015–2020) focuses on integrating technology for sustainable tourism, including energy efficiency improvements, data-driven management, and citizen participation. The city also established a Smart Destination Living Lab to align its strategies with the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

== Local politics ==
After giving the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party majorities or pluralities in elections from the restoration of democracy in 1977, Benidorm has favoured the right wing People&#x27;s Party (PP) since the general elections of 1993. The PP gained control of the local council at the 1995 local elections and won 14 of the 25 council seats in the 1999 and 2003 elections. The 2007 election gave them a one-seat majority over the PSOE, but disagreements in the PP group led to a motion of censure being passed against the PP mayor in September 2009. He was replaced by the socialist Agustín Navarro. In 2019, PP won the local elections, obtaining an absolute majority. 
As of the 2019 local elections, the political composition on the local council was the following:
In the 2023 election held on 28 May the results were:
== Geography ==
The town is divided into five parts: &quot;Poniente&quot; (&quot;Ponent&quot; or &#x27;sun setting&#x27;) and &quot;Levante&quot; (&quot;Llevant&quot; or &#x27;sun rising&#x27;), each fronted by a beach of the same name; the old town (also called &quot;El Castell&quot;); &quot;La Cala&quot; situated to the west side of Poniente; and &quot;El Rincón de Loix&quot; (or &quot;El Racó de l&#x27;Oix&quot;) situated to the east side of Levante. Between the two beaches lies a rocky promontory and the port.

The old city occupies the promontory and the area immediately inland, while most of the hotels occupy the more recently developed sections inland from the two beaches. A few miles from shore is an uninhabited island known as Benidorm Island or Peacock Island (due to previously having a peacock enclosure) which provides a dramatic centrepiece to the seascape.

In 1954 Pedro Zaragoza Orts, the then young Mayor of Benidorm, created the &quot;Plan General de Ordenación&quot; (city building plan) that ensured, via a complex construction formula, every building would have an area of leisure land, guaranteeing a future free of the excesses of cramped construction seen in other areas of Spain. It is the only city in Spain that still adheres to this rigid rule. Most of the streets in the city are named after places such as Avenida de Uruguay, Avenida del Mediterráneo, Calle Pekín, etc. Avenida del Mediterráneo is a wide avenue that crosses Levante and links the old town with Rincón. Avenida Europa crosses Levante at right angles linking the western city limits with the Levante beach.

Benidorm is connected to the FGV railway line between Alicante (&quot;Alacant&quot;) and Dénia. The section to Alicante is now converted to tram operation and trams run at least every half an hour between Benidorm and Alicante (see Alicante Tram). Trains run hourly from Benidorm to Dénia (via towns of Altea and Calp), connecting with the trams at Benidorm station.

=== Climate ===
Benidorm has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;) with mild winters and hot sultry summers. The city receives slightly more than 300 mm in precipitation per year and the wettest season is the mid-late autumn. It enjoys more than 2,800 hours of sunshine per year and the average annual temperature is around . The typical maximum temperatures during winter average around , while the typical lows average around . The temperature oscillation is small, being even smaller during summers, during the summer the maximum temperatures normally range from 28 to 32 °C while the lows range from 20 to 24 °C. In almost all of the summer months the average city minimum temperatures at night remain above 20 °C (68 °F), a phenomenon referred to as tropical night. It is also common during the summer for humidity levels to be high, increasing the feeling of stuffy and sticky weather, which consequently increases the heat index.

==Tourism==


Benidorm is popular with tourists from the UK, Ireland, Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands. Benidorm&#x27;s initial growth in popularity can be attributed to the package holiday explosion, and continues year round, due to the night-life based around the central concentration of bars and clubs. The large number of free cabaret acts that start around 21:00 and continue into the early hours sets Benidorm apart from other similar cities.

The author and &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Giles Tremlett identified the city as the birthplace of package tourism in the book &quot;Ghosts of Spain: Travels Through a Country&#x27;s Hidden Past&quot; and remarked that culturally the city contradicted conservative notions of National Catholicism that General Franco had espoused. The accessibility of Benidorm to a wider social strata made the town into an ever so easy target for highbrow sarcasm, as by Jani Allan in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in 1990: &quot;These days you just have to look at the numbers of wide-bodied jets bearing wide-bodied holidaymakers to Benidorm to realise that package holidays and airborne cattle trucks make fun in the sun accessible to everyone.&quot;

In the 1980s Benidorm developed a reputation for British drunken lager louts and violent binge drinking. This happened mainly in the summer months of July and August.

The town is now very popular with families. Also, many elderly people from northern Europe pass the winter there. This made &#x27;Benidorm&#x27; into something of a synonym for elderly people in those countries, as can be seen in the Flemish candid camera programme &quot;Benidorm Bastards&quot;.

Benidorm has three major beaches: &quot;Playa de Levante&quot; (Valencian: &quot;Platja de Llevant&quot;), &quot;Playa de Poniente&quot; (Valencian: &quot;Platja de Ponent&quot;) and &quot;Playa de Mal Pas&quot; (Valencian: &quot;Platja del Mal Pas&quot;); all of them have had a blue flag since 1987, the maximum quality standard recognised by the European Union. The Gran Hotel Bali, a four-star hotel located in this city since 2002, is a 186-metre-tall building that stood as the tallest skyscraper in Spain for five years, until it was surpassed by the CTBA towers in Madrid and Intempo building, also in Benidorm. The Intempo building is currently the fifth-tallest in Spain and the tallest building in the Valencian Community.

If you want to move around the area, the taxi service in Benidorm is recommended, on the other hand, if you are still at Alicante airport, you can use the Alicante airport to Benidorm taxi service available 24 hours a day. 

=== Events and attractions ===
Every summer from 1959 to 2000, the city celebrated the Benidorm International Song Festival, a song contest where international or Spanish celebrities such as Julio Iglesias, Raphael or the Dúo Dinámico became famous. Loosely based on the song festival, RTVE signed, in 2021, a four-year contract with the city of Benidorm to hold the preselection to determine the Spanish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, naming the event Benidorm Fest.

Since 2010, in July, Benidorm hosts an indie music festival, with national and international music groups, called &quot;Benidorm Low Festival&quot;. In 2019, a counterpart of Primavera Sound, Primavera Weekender, premiered at Magic Robin Hood Camp.

In 2011, Benidorm hosted the start of the Vuelta a España, one of cycling&#x27;s three grand tours.

Benidorm is home to the annual open water swimming competition of the Oceanman series.

Benidorm boasts three family-oriented theme parks: Terra Mítica is inland from the city, at the foot of the mountain, and Aqualandia and Mundomar are located on the outskirts of the city on the Levante side. Benidorm offers activities for all ages. With all the family attractions available, Benidorm has been described as one of the most family-oriented holiday destinations in Spain and Europe. In addition to large shopping and commercial areas. An episode of the hit British sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; was set in Benidorm. The episode was called &quot;It Never Rains...&quot;.
A TV series called &quot;Benidorm&quot; has aired on ITV (with replays on ITV2) in the UK. Actors include Jake Canuso, Steve Pemberton, Sheila Reid and comedian Johnny Vegas. Airing of the tenth series began in February 2018. In 2020 a Spanish comedy series of the same name starring Antonio Pagudo and María Almudéver premiered on Atresplayer Premium.

Belgian TV channel VTM aired their own series, &quot;Benidorm&quot;, which was based upon a Dutch-language theatre play.

<text>Jean Harlow (born Harlean Harlow Carpenter; March 3, 1911 – June 7, 1937) was an American actress. Known for her portrayal of &quot;bad girl&quot; characters, she was the leading sex symbol of the early 1930s and one of the defining figures of the pre-Code era of American cinema. Often nicknamed the &quot;Blonde Bombshell&quot; and the &quot;Platinum Blonde&quot;, Harlow was popular for her &quot;Laughing Vamp&quot; screen persona. Harlow was in the film industry for only nine years, but she became one of Hollywood&#x27;s biggest movie stars, whose image in the public eye has endured. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Harlow number 22 on its greatest female screen legends list.

Harlow was first signed by business magnate Howard Hughes, who directed her first major role in &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1930). After a series of critically failed films, and Hughes&#x27; loss of interest in her career, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought out Harlow&#x27;s contract in 1932 and cast her in leading roles in a string of hits built on her comedic talent: &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; (1932), &quot;Red Dust&quot; (1932), &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; (1933), &quot;Reckless&quot; (1935) and &quot;Suzy&quot; (1936). Harlow&#x27;s popularity rivaled and then surpassed that of MGM&#x27;s top leading ladies Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo and Norma Shearer. She died at the age of 26 of kidney failure while filming &quot;Saratoga&quot;. MGM completed the film with the use of body doubles and released it less than two months after her death; it became the highest-grossing film of 1937, as well as the highest-grossing film of her career.

==Life and career==

=== 1911-1925: Early life and education ===
Harlow was born Harlean Harlow Carpenter in a house located at 3344 Olive Street in Kansas City, Missouri.

Her father, Mont Clair Carpenter (1877–1974), son of Abraham L. Carpenter and Dianna (&quot;née&quot; Beal), was a dentist who attended dental school in Kansas City. He was from a working-class background. Her mother, Jean Poe Carpenter (&quot;née&quot; Harlow; 1891–1958), was the daughter of wealthy real estate broker Skip Harlow and his wife, Ella Harlow (&quot;née&quot; Williams). In 1908, Skip Harlow arranged his daughter&#x27;s marriage to Mont Clair Carpenter. She was underage at the time and grew resentful and unhappy in the marriage, but the Carpenters remained together living in a Kansas City house owned by her father.
Harlean&#x27;s family called her &quot;Baby,&quot; a nickname to which she was accustomed and which endured for the rest of her life. It was not until she was five years old that she learned her real name was Harlean, when staff and students at Miss Barstow&#x27;s Finishing School for Girls used the name. Harlean was always very close to her mother, who was extremely protective. Her mother was reported to have instilled a sense in her daughter that she owed everything she had to her; &quot;She was always all mine!&quot;, Mama Jean said of her daughter in interviews. Jean Carpenter was later known by &quot;Mama Jean&quot; when Harlean achieved star status as Jean Harlow.

When Harlean was at finishing school, her mother filed for a divorce. On September 29, 1922, the uncontested divorce was finalized, giving sole custody of Harlean to her mother. Although Harlean loved her father, she did not see him often after the divorce.

In 1923, the 32-year-old Jean Carpenter took her daughter and moved to Hollywood in hopes of becoming an actress, but was told that she was too old to begin a film career. Harlean was enrolled at the Hollywood School for Girls, where she met Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Joel McCrea, and Irene Mayer Selznick, but dropped out at the age of 14, in the spring of 1925.

With their finances dwindling, Jean and Harlean moved back to Kansas City after Skip Harlow issued an ultimatum that he would disinherit his daughter if they did not return. Several weeks later, Skip sent his granddaughter to summer camp at Camp Cha-Ton-Ka, in Michigamme, Michigan, where she became ill with scarlet fever. Jean Carpenter traveled to Michigan to care for Harlean, rowing herself across the lake to the camp, but was told that she could not see her daughter.

Harlean next attended the Ferry Hall School (now Lake Forest Academy) in Lake Forest, Illinois. Jean Carpenter had an ulterior motive for her daughter&#x27;s attendance at this particular school: It was close to the Chicago home of her boyfriend, Marino Bello.

=== 1926-1928: First marriage ===
During Harlow&#x27;s freshman year at the school, she was paired with a &quot;big sister&quot; from the senior class who introduced her to 19-year-old Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Fremont McGrew III, an heir to a large fortune. By the fall of 1926, Harlow and Chuck were dating seriously, and they were married in 1928. Jean Carpenter was also married that same year to Marino Bello, on January 18. However, Harlow did not attend her mother&#x27;s wedding.

In 1928, two months after the wedding, Chuck McGrew turned 21 and received part of his inheritance. The couple left Chicago and moved to Los Angeles, settling into a home in Beverly Hills, where Harlow thrived as a wealthy socialite. McGrew hoped to distance Harlow from her mother with the move. Neither Chuck nor Harlow worked during this time, and both were considered heavy drinkers.

===1928–1929: Work as an extra===
While living in Los Angeles, Harlean befriended a young aspiring actress named Rosalie Roy. Not owning a car herself, Rosalie asked Harlean to drive her to Fox Studios for an appointment. While waiting for Rosalie, Harlean was noticed and approached by Fox executives, whom she told she was not interested. Nevertheless, she was given letters of introduction to Central Casting. A few days later, Rosalie Roy bet Harlean that she did not have the nerve to go in for an audition. Unwilling to lose a wager and pressed by her enthusiastic mother who had followed her daughter to Los Angeles by this time, Harlean went to Central Casting and signed in under her mother&#x27;s maiden name, Jean Harlow.

After several calls from casting and a number of job offers rejected by Harlean, Mother Jean finally pressed her into accepting work at the studio. Harlean appeared in her first film, &quot;Honor Bound&quot; (1928), as an unbilled &quot;extra&quot; for $7 a day (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars) and a box lunch, common pay for such work. This led to a wage increase to $10 per day and small parts in feature films such as &quot;Moran of the Marines&quot; (1928) and the Charley Chase lost film &quot;Chasing Husbands&quot; (1928). In December 1928, Harlean as Jean Harlow signed a five-year contract with Hal Roach Studios for $100 per week. She had small roles in the 1929 Laurel and Hardy shorts: &quot;Double Whoopee&quot;, &quot;Liberty&quot; and &quot;Bacon Grabbers&quot;, the last giving her a costarring credit.

In March 1929, she parted with Hal Roach, who tore up her contract after Harlow told him, &quot;It&#x27;s breaking up my marriage, what can I do?&quot; In June 1929, Harlow separated from her husband, who disapproved of her career, and moved in with Mother Jean and Bello. After her separation from McGrew, Harlow continued working as an &quot;extra&quot; in such films as &quot;This Thing Called Love&quot;, &quot;Close Harmony&quot;, and &quot;The Love Parade&quot; (all 1929), until she landed her first speaking role in the Clara Bow film &quot;The Saturday Night Kid&quot;. Harlow and her husband divorced in 1929.

===1929–1932: Platinum blonde star===

In late 1929, Harlow was spotted by Ben Lyon, an actor filming Howard Hughes&#x27; &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;; another account gives &quot;Angels&quot; head cameraman Arthur Landau as the man who spotted and suggested her to Hughes. Hughes was reshooting most of his originally silent film with sound and needed an actress to replace Greta Nissen, whose Norwegian accent was undesirable for her character. Harlow screen-tested for Hughes, who gave her the part. On October 24, 1929, Harlow signed a five-year contract with Hughes, paying $100-per-week (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars).

During filming of &quot;Hells Angels&quot;, Harlow met MGM executive Paul Bern, her future husband, for the first time.

&quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; premiered in Hollywood at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on May 27, 1930, and became the highest-grossing film of that year, besting even Greta Garbo&#x27;s talkie debut in &quot;Anna Christie&quot;. &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; made Harlow an international star. Though she was popular with audiences, the critics were less than enthusiastic. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called her performance &quot;plain awful&quot;, though &quot;Variety&quot; magazine conceded, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter what degree of talent she possesses ... nobody ever starved possessing what she&#x27;s got.&quot;In spite of her relative success with &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Harlow again found herself in the role of &quot;uncredited extra&quot; in the Charlie Chaplin film &quot;City Lights&quot; (1931), though her appearance did not make the final cut. With no other projects planned for Harlow at the time, Hughes decided to send her to New York, Seattle, and Kansas City for &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; premieres. In 1931, his Caddo Company loaned her out to other studios, where she gained more attention by appearing in &quot;The Secret Six&quot;, with Wallace Beery and Clark Gable; &quot;Iron Man&quot;, with Lew Ayres and Robert Armstrong; and &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;, with James Cagney. Even though the successes of these films ranged from moderate to hit, Harlow&#x27;s acting ability was mocked by critics. Hughes sent her on a brief publicity tour in order to bolster her career, but this was not a success as Harlow dreaded making personal appearances.

Harlow briefly dated gangster Abner Zwillman, who bought her a jeweled bracelet and a red Cadillac, and made a large cash loan to studio head Harry Cohn to obtain a two-picture deal for her at Columbia Pictures. The relationship ended when he reportedly referred to her in derogatory and vulgar terms when speaking to other associated crime figures, as revealed in secret surveillance recordings.

Columbia Pictures first cast Harlow in a Frank Capra film with Loretta Young, originally titled &quot;Gallagher&quot; for Young&#x27;s lead character but renamed &quot;Platinum Blonde&quot; to capitalize on Hughes&#x27; publicity of Harlow&#x27;s &quot;platinum&quot; hair color. Though Harlow denied her hair was bleached, the platinum blonde color was reportedly achieved with a weekly application of ammonia, Clorox bleach, and Lux soap flakes. This process weakened and damaged Harlow&#x27;s naturally ash-blonde hair. Many female fans began dyeing their hair to match hers and Hughes&#x27; team organized a series of &quot;Platinum Blonde&quot; clubs across the nation offering a prize of $10,000 to any beautician who could match Harlow&#x27;s shade. No one could, and the prize went unclaimed, but the publicity scheme worked and the &quot;Platinum Blonde&quot; nickname stuck with Harlow. Her second film for that studio was &quot;Three Wise Girls&quot; (1932), with Mae Clarke and Walter Byron, in which she was top billed for the first time.

Paul Bern then arranged with Hughes to borrow her for MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Beast of the City&quot; (1932), co-starring Walter Huston. After filming, Bern booked a 10-week personal-appearance tour on the East Coast. To the surprise of many, especially Harlow herself, she packed every theater in which she appeared, often appearing in a single venue for several nights. Despite critical disparagement and poor roles, Harlow&#x27;s popularity and following were large and growing, and in February 1932, the tour was extended by six weeks.

According to Fay Wray, who played Ann Darrow in RKO Pictures&#x27;s &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), Harlow was the original choice to play the screaming blonde heroine, but was under an exclusive contract with MGM during the film&#x27;s pre-production phase—and the part went to Wray, a brunette who had to wear a blonde wig.

When mobster Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel came to Hollywood to expand casino operations, Harlow became the informal godmother of Siegel&#x27;s eldest daughter, Millicent, when the family lived in Beverly Hills.

===1932–1937: Successful actress at MGM===
Paul Bern was now romantically involved with Harlow and spoke to Louis B. Mayer about buying her contract with Hughes and signing her to MGM, but Mayer declined. MGM&#x27;s leading ladies were presented as elegant, and Harlow&#x27;s screen persona was not so to Mayer. Bern then began urging close friend Irving Thalberg, production head of MGM, to sign Harlow, noting her popularity and established image. After initial reluctance Thalberg agreed, and on March 3, 1932, Harlow&#x27;s 21st birthday, Bern called her with the news that MGM had purchased her contract from Hughes for $30,000. Harlow officially joined the studio on April 20, 1932.
At MGM, Harlow was given superior movie roles to show off her looks and nascent comedic talent. Though her screen persona changed dramatically during her career, one constant was her sense of humor. In 1932, she starred in the comedy &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot; for which she received $1,250 a week. It was the first film in which she &quot;resembles something of an actress&quot;, portraying a woman who is successful at being amoral in a film that does not moralize or punish the character for her behavior. The film is often noted as being one of the few films in which Harlow did not appear with platinum blonde hair; she wore a red wig for the role. While Harlow was filming &quot;Red-Headed Woman&quot;, actress Anita Page passed her on the studio lot without acknowledging her. She later told Page that the snub had caused her to cry until she saw herself, noticed the red wig, and burst out laughing when she realized Page had not recognized her. &quot;That shows you how sensitive she was&quot;, Page said. &quot;She was a lovely person in so many ways.&quot;

She next starred in &quot;Red Dust&quot;, her second film with Clark Gable. Harlow and Gable worked well together and co-starred in a total of six films. She was also paired multiple times with Spencer Tracy and William Powell. MGM began trying to distinguish Harlow&#x27;s public persona from her screen characters by putting out press releases that her childhood surname was not the common &#x27;Carpenter&#x27; but the chic &#x27;Carpentiér&#x27;, claiming that writer Edgar Allan Poe was one of her ancestors and publishing photographs of her doing charity work to change her image to that of an all-American woman. This transformation proved difficult; once, Harlow was heard muttering, &quot;My God, must I always wear a low-cut dress to be important?&quot;

During the making of &quot;Red Dust&quot;, Bern—her husband of two months—was found dead at their home; this created a lasting scandal. Initially, Harlow was suspected of killing Bern, but his death was officially ruled a suicide by self-inflicted gunshot wound. Louis B. Mayer feared negative publicity from the incident and intended to replace Harlow in the film, offering the role to Tallulah Bankhead. Bankhead was appalled by the offer and wrote in her autobiography, &quot;To damn the radiant Jean for the misfortune of another would be one of the shabbiest acts of all time. I told Mr. Mayer as much.&quot; Harlow kept silent, survived the ordeal, and became more popular than ever. A 2009 biography of Bern asserted that Bern was, in fact, murdered by a former lover and the crime scene re-arranged by MGM executives to make it appear Bern had killed himself.

After Bern&#x27;s death, Harlow began an indiscreet affair with boxer Max Baer who, though separated from his wife Dorothy Dunbar, was threatened with divorce proceedings naming Harlow as a co-respondent for alienation of affection, a legal term for adultery. After Bern&#x27;s death, the studio did not want another scandal and defused the situation by arranging a marriage between Harlow and cinematographer Harold Rosson. Rosson and Harlow were friends, and Rosson went along with the plan. They quietly divorced eight months later.
By 1933, MGM realized the value of the Harlow-Gable team with &quot;Red Dust&quot; and paired them again in &quot;Hold Your Man&quot; (1933), which was also a box-office success. In the same year, she played the adulterous wife of Wallace Beery in the all-star comedy-drama &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, and played a pressured Hollywood film star in the screwball comedy &quot;Bombshell&quot; with Lee Tracy and Franchot Tone. The film has been said to be based on Harlow&#x27;s own life or that of 1920s &quot;It girl&quot; Clara Bow.

The following year, she was teamed with Lionel Barrymore and Tone in &quot;The Girl from Missouri&quot; (1934). The film was the studio&#x27;s attempt to soften Harlow&#x27;s image, but suffered from censorship problems, so much so that its original title, &quot;Born to Be Kissed&quot;, had to be changed.

After the hit &quot;Hold Your Man&quot;, MGM cast the Harlow-Gable team in two more successful films: &quot;China Seas&quot; (1935), with Wallace Beery and Rosalind Russell; and &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot; (1936), with Myrna Loy and James Stewart. Stewart later spoke of a scene in a car with Harlow in &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot;, saying, &quot;Clarence Brown, the director, wasn&#x27;t too pleased by the way I did the smooching. He made us repeat the scene about half a dozen times ... I botched it up on purpose. That Jean Harlow sure was a good kisser. I realized that until then, I had never been really kissed.&quot;
Harlow was consistently voted one of the strongest box office draws in the United States from 1933 onward, often outranking her female colleagues at MGM in audience popularity polls. By the mid-1930s, she was one of the biggest stars in the US, and, it was hoped, MGM&#x27;s next Greta Garbo. Still young, her star continued to rise while the popularity of other female stars at MGM, such as Garbo, Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer, waned. Harlow&#x27;s movies continued to make huge profits at the box office even during the middle of the Depression.

After her third marriage ended in 1934, Harlow met William Powell, another MGM star, and quickly fell in love. The couple were reportedly engaged for two years, but differences that ranged from past marriages to Powell&#x27;s uncertainty about the future, kept them from publicly formalizing their relationship. The two co-starred in her next film &quot;Reckless&quot; (1935), her first movie musical; her voice was dubbed with that of vocalist Virginia Verrill.

&quot;Suzy&quot; (1936), in which she played the title role, gave her top billing over four time co-star Tone and Cary Grant. While critics noted that Harlow dominated the film, it was a reasonable box-office success. She then starred in &quot;Riffraff&quot; (1936) a financial disappointment that co-starred Spencer Tracy and Una Merkel. Afterwards the release of worldwide hit &quot;Libeled Lady&quot; (1936), in which she was top-billed over Powell, Loy, and Tracy, brought good reviews for Harlow&#x27;s comedic performance. During the filming, Jean Harlow was involved with William Powell while Spencer Tracy was having an affair with Myrna Loy. She then filmed W.S. Van Dyke&#x27;s comedy &quot;Personal Property&quot; (1937), co-starring Robert Taylor. It was Harlow&#x27;s final completed motion picture appearance.

=== Illness and death ===
In January 1937, Harlow and Robert Taylor traveled to Washington, D.C., to take part in fundraising activities associated with Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s birthday, for the organization later known as the March of Dimes. Harlow, a Democrat, had campaigned for Roosevelt in the 1936 United States presidential election, and two years earlier for Upton Sinclair in the 1934 California gubernatorial election. The trip was physically taxing for Harlow, and she contracted influenza. She recovered in time to attend the Academy Awards ceremony with William Powell.

Filming for Harlow&#x27;s final film, &quot;Saratoga&quot;, co-starring Clark Gable, was scheduled to begin in March 1937. However, production was delayed when she developed sepsis after a multiple wisdom tooth extraction, and had to be hospitalized. Almost two months later, Harlow recovered, and shooting began on April 22, 1937. She also appeared on the May 3 cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine in photographs by Martin Munkácsi.

On May 20, 1937, while filming &quot;Saratoga&quot;, Harlow began to complain of illness. Her symptoms—fatigue, nausea, fluid retention and abdominal pain—did not seem very serious to the studio doctor, who believed that she was suffering from cholecystitis and influenza. The doctor was not aware that Harlow had been ill during the previous year with a severe sunburn and influenza. Friend and co-star Una Merkel noticed Harlow&#x27;s on-set weight gain, gray pallor and fatigue.

On May 29, while Harlow filmed a scene in which her character had a fever, she was clearly sicker than her character and leaned against her co-star Gable between takes and said, &quot;I feel terrible! Get me back to my dressing room.&quot; She requested that the assistant director telephone William Powell, who immediately left his own movie set, in order to escort her back home.

The next day, Powell checked on Harlow and discovered that her condition had not improved. He contacted her mother and insisted that she cut her holiday short to be at her daughter&#x27;s side. Powell also summoned a doctor. Because Harlow&#x27;s previous illnesses had delayed the shooting of three movies (&quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot;, &quot;Suzy&quot;, and &quot;Libeled Lady&quot;), initially there was no great concern regarding this latest bout with a recurring illness. On June 2, it was announced she was again suffering from influenza. Ernest Fishbaugh, who had been called to Harlow&#x27;s home to treat her, diagnosed her with an inflamed gallbladder. Mother Jean told MGM that Harlow was feeling better on June 3, and co-workers expected her back on the set by Monday, June 7, 1937. Press reports were contradictory, with headlines reading &quot;Jean Harlow seriously ill&quot; and &quot;Harlow recovers from illness crisis&quot;. When she did not return to set, a concerned Gable visited her and later remarked that she was severely bloated and that he smelled urine on her breath when he kissed her—both signs of kidney failure.

Leland Chapman, a colleague of Fishbaugh, was called in to give a second opinion on Harlow&#x27;s condition. Chapman recognized that she was not suffering from an inflamed gallbladder, but was in the final stages of kidney failure. On June 6, 1937, Harlow said that she could not see Powell clearly and could not tell how many fingers he was holding up.

That evening, she was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, where she slipped into a coma. The next day at 11:37 a.m., Harlow died in the hospital at the age of 26. In the doctor&#x27;s press releases, the cause of death was given as cerebral edema, a complication of kidney failure. Hospital records mention uremia.

For years, rumors circulated about Harlow&#x27;s death. Some claimed that her mother had refused to call a doctor because she was a Christian Scientist or that Harlow had declined hospital treatment or surgery. From the onset of her illness, Harlow had been attended by a doctor while she was resting at home. Two nurses also visited her house, and various equipment was brought from a nearby hospital. Harlow&#x27;s grayish complexion, recurring illnesses, and severe sunburn were signs of the disease. Toxins also adversely affected her brain and central nervous system.

Harlow suffered from scarlet fever when she was 15, and speculation that she suffered a poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis following the incident, which may have caused high blood pressure and ultimately kidney failure, has been suggested. Her death certificate lists the cause of death as &quot;acute respiratory infection&quot;, &quot;acute nephritis&quot;, and &quot;uremia&quot;.

One MGM writer later said, &quot;The day Baby died...there wasn&#x27;t one sound in the commissary for three hours.&quot; Frequent costar Spencer Tracy wrote in his diary, &quot;Jean Harlow died. Grand girl.&quot;

Her funeral was held on June 9, 1937, in the Wee Kirk o&#x27; the Heather chapel in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, and was interred in the park&#x27;s Great Mausoleum in a private room of multicolored marble, which William Powell bought for $25,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars). She was laid to rest in the pink negligee she&#x27;d worn in &quot;Saratoga&quot; and in her hands she had a white gardenia along with a note that Powell had written: &quot;Goodnight, my dearest darling.&quot; Harlow&#x27;s inscription on her crypt reads, &quot;Our Baby&quot;.Spaces in the same room were reserved for Harlow&#x27;s mother and Powell. Harlow&#x27;s mother was buried there in 1958, but Powell married actress Diana Lewis in 1940. After his death in 1984, he was cremated and his ashes buried in Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.

MGM planned to replace Harlow in &quot;Saratoga&quot; with either Jean Arthur or Virginia Bruce, but because of public objections, the film was finished using three doubles (Mary Dees for close-ups, Geraldine Dvorak for long shots, and Paula Winslowe for dubbing Harlow&#x27;s lines) and rewriting some scenes without her. The film was released on July 23, 1937, less than two months after Harlow&#x27;s death, and was a hit with audiences, grossing $3.3 million in worldwide rentals and becoming the highest-grossing film of the year, as well as the highest-grossing film of Jean Harlow&#x27;s career.

== Legacy ==
According to Camille Paglia, the notion that blondes have more fun was started in Hollywood by Harlow. Pagilia noted &quot;The woman who really started all this in Hollywood was Jean Harlow, with that platinum blonde look which was so incredibly unnatural. With her it was associated with being a harlot — she was mimicking the slouchy, louche look of someone who&#x27;s a machine for pleasure.&quot;

She is noted to have inspired Marilyn Monroe, Madonna and others.

Her name was given to a cocktail, the &quot;Jean Harlow&quot;, which is equal parts light rum and sweet vermouth.

Blues musician Lead Belly wrote the song &quot;Jean Harlow&quot; while in prison upon hearing about her death.

The French composer Charles Koechlin composed the piece &quot;Épitaphe de Jean Harlow&quot; (opus 164) in 1937.

On February 8, 1960, Jean Harlow was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6910 Hollywood Boulevard on the south part of the Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.

Kim Carnes&#x27;s hit &quot;Bette Davis Eyes&quot; (1981) contains the line &quot;her hair is Harlow gold.&quot;

Harlow&#x27;s signature, hands and footprints were imprinted in cement on September 29, 1933, in the 24th ceremony at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater and are located near the forecourt on the west side of the box office at 6925 Hollywood Boulevard, Hollywood, California.

== Novel ==

Harlow wrote a novel titled &quot;Today Is Tonight&quot;. In Arthur Landau&#x27;s introduction to the 1965 paperback edition, Harlow stated around 1933–1934 her intention to write the book, but it was not published during her lifetime. During her life, Harlow&#x27;s stepfather Marino Bello shopped the unpublished manuscript to a few studios. Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, prevented the book from being sold by putting an injunction on it using a clause in Harlow&#x27;s contract: her services as an artist couldn&#x27;t be used without MGM&#x27;s permission. After her death, Landau wrote, her mother sold the film rights to MGM, though no film was made. The publication rights were passed from Harlow&#x27;s mother to a family friend, and the book was finally published in 1965.

== Film portrayals ==

Film adaptations of Harlow&#x27;s life were considered at different times during the 1950s. Twentieth Century-Fox had slated Jayne Mansfield for the role, and ideas for Columbia Pictures actress Cleo Moore to play Harlow were also tabled. These projects never materialized. Marilyn Monroe was given a role for Harlow in 1953, but she declined it, feeling it was under-developed.

In 1965, two films about Jean Harlow were released, both titled &quot;Harlow&quot;. The first film was released by Magna Corporation in May 1965, and starred Carol Lynley. The second film was released in June 1965 by Paramount Pictures, and starred Carroll Baker. Both were poorly received, and did not perform well at the box office.

In 1975, Roberta Collins played Harlow in the rhythm-and-blues band Bloodstone&#x27;s pop musical movie &quot;Train Ride to Hollywood&quot;.

In 1978, Lindsay Bloom portrayed her in &quot;Hughes and Harlow: Angels in Hell&quot;.

In August 1993, Sharon Stone hosted a documentary about Harlow titled &quot;Harlow: The Blonde Bombshell&quot;, which aired on Turner Classic Movies.

In 2004, Gwen Stefani briefly appeared as Harlow at the red carpet premiere for &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s Howard Hughes biopic &quot;The Aviator&quot;.

<doc id="294015" wikidata="Q1138610" url="?curid=294015" title="Don (honorific)">
<text>The term  (, literally &#x27;Lord&#x27;) abbreviated as D., is an honorific prefix primarily used in Spain and Hispanic America, and with different connotations also in Italy, Portugal and its former colonies, and formerly in the Philippines.

 is derived from the Latin : a master of a household, a title with background from the Roman Republic in classical antiquity. With the abbreviated form having emerged as such in the Middle Ages, traditionally it is reserved for Catholic clergy and nobles, in addition to certain educational authorities and persons of high distinction.

The older form of  is the variant used in Portuguese, which in Brazil is reserved for bishops. The title is also used among Benedictine monks for those members of the community who have professed perpetual religious vows. The equivalent of Doña or Dame is used by nuns of the Order.

In Spanish, although originally a title reserved for royalty, select nobles, and church hierarchs, it is now often used as a mark of esteem for an individual of personal, social or official distinction, such as a community leader of long-standing, a person of significant wealth, a noble, or the member of an order of merit. As a style, rather than a title or rank, it is used with, rather than in place of, a person&#x27;s name.

The feminine equivalents are &#x27; (), &#x27; (), &#x27; (Romanian) and &#x27; () abbreviated &#x27;D.ª&#x27;, &#x27;Da.&#x27;, or simply &#x27;D.&#x27; It is a common honorific reserved for women, especially mature women. In Portuguese tends to be less restricted in use to women than is to men.
Today in the Spanish language, is used to respectfully refer to a mature woman. In present-day Hispanic America, the title or is sometimes used in honorific form when addressing a senior citizen. In some countries, &quot;Don&quot; or &quot;Doña&quot; may be used as a generic honorific, similar to &quot;sir&quot; and &quot;madam&quot; in the United States.

In Spanish, and convey a higher degree of reverence. Unlike &quot;The Honourable&quot; in English (but like the English &quot;Sir&quot; for a knight or baronet), may be used when speaking directly to a person, and unlike &quot;Lord&quot; it must be used with a given name. For example, &quot;Don Diego de la Vega&quot; or simply &quot;Don Diego&quot; (the secret identity of Zorro) are typical forms. But a form using the last name (e.g. &quot;Don de la Vega&quot;) is not considered correct and rarely would be used by Spanish speakers (&quot;&quot;Señor&quot; de la Vega&quot; would be used instead).

== Spanish-speaking countries and territories ==
Historically, was used to address members of the nobility, e.g. &quot;hidalgos&quot;, as well as members of the secular clergy. The treatment gradually came to be reserved for persons of the blood royal, e.g. Don John of Austria, and those of such acknowledged high or ancient aristocratic birth as to be noble , that is, &quot;by right and heredity&quot; rather than by the king&#x27;s grace. However, there were rare exemptions to the rule, such as the mulatto Miguel Enríquez who received the distinction from Philip V due to his privateering work in the Caribbean. It is now often used as a more formal version of , a term which itself was also once used to address someone with the quality of nobility (not necessarily holding a nobiliary title).

=== Spain ===
During the reign of King Juan Carlos of Spain, from 1975 until his abdication on 19 June 2014, he was titled (His Majesty King Juan Carlos). Following the abdication, Royal Decree 1368/1987 gave Juan Carlos and his wife the official style (H.M. King Juan Carlos) and (H.M. Queen Sofía)—the same as during his reign, with the honorific / prefixed to the names. Don Juan Carlos&#x27; successor is .

Spanish law grants Spanish nationals who are Knights or Dames of the Order of Civil Merit, the Order of Charles III, and the Order of Isabella the Catholic the formal style &quot;Don&quot; (for Knights) or &quot;Doña&quot; (for Dames), used in the same way as Sir or Dame for knighted British nationals.

====Basque====
The Spanish usage is similar among Basque speakers in Spain using and .
The honorific is sometimes adapted as as in the priest and scholar () or fictional knight (Don Quixote).

=== Sephardi Jews ===
The honorific was also used among Ladino-speaking Sephardi Jews, as part of the Spanish culture which they took with them after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492.

=== Hispanic America ===
The honorific title was widely used in Crown documents throughout Hispanic America by those in nobility or landed gentry. It can be found in the many &#x27;Padrones&#x27; and &quot;Aguas y Tierras&quot; records in Mexican archives. The honorific in modern times is also widely used throughout the Americas. This is the case of the Mexican New Age author Don Miguel Ángel Ruiz, the Chilean television personality Don Francisco, and the Puerto Rican industrialist and politician Don Luis Ferré, among many other figures. Although Puerto Rican politician Pedro Albizu Campos had a doctoral degree, he has been titled . Likewise, Puerto Rican Governor Luis Muñoz Marín has often been called Don Luís Muñoz Marin instead of &quot;Governor&quot; Muñoz Marin. In the same manner, &quot;Don&quot; Miguel Ángel Ruiz is an M.D. Additionally the honorific is usually used with people of older age.

The same happens in other Hispanic American countries. For example, despite having a doctoral degree in theology, the Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia was usually styled as &quot;Don&quot;. Likewise, despite being a respected military commander with the rank of Brigade General, Argentine Ruler Juan Manuel de Rosas was formally and informally styled &quot;Don&quot; as a more important title.

Prior to the American ownership of the Southwest, a number of Americans immigrated to California, where they often became Mexican citizens and changed their given names to Spanish equivalents, for example &quot;Juan Temple&quot; for Jonathan Temple. It was common for them to assume the honorific &quot;don&quot; once they had attained a significant degree of distinction in the community.

=== Philippines ===
In the Spanish colonial Philippines, this honorific was reserved to the nobility, the prehispanic &quot;datu&quot; that became the &quot;principalía&quot;, whose right to rule was recognised by Philip II on 11 June 1594. Similar to Latin America, the title &quot;Don&quot; is considered highly honoured, more so than academic titles such as &quot;Doctor&quot;, political titles such as &quot;Governor&quot;, and even knights titled &quot;&quot;Sir&quot;.&quot; Usage was retained during the American period, although traditional official positions of the &quot;principalía&quot; (e.g., &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; and &quot;cabeza de barangay&quot;) were replaced by American political positions such as the municipal president. The practise slowly faded after World War II, as heirs of the &quot;principalía&quot; often did not inherit the title, and as civic leaders were chosen by popular election. Prior to 1954, the appointment and tenure of mayors was at the pleasure of the president of the Philippines, pursuant to Commonwealth Act No. 158 amending Commonwealth Act No. 57., Section 8 of Commonwealth Act No. 158, as amended by Republic Act No. 276. The 1987 Constitution, meanwhile, explicitly prohibits recognition of titles of nobility, thus the terms &quot;Don&quot; and &quot;Doña&quot; are now courtesy titles with no requirements for their attainment other than common usage for socially prominent and rich persons.

== Italy ==

Officially, was the honorific title exclusively reserved for a member of a high noble family such a &quot;principe or&quot; a &quot;duca,&quot; excluding a &quot;marchese&quot; or a &quot;conte&quot; (and any legitimate, male-line descendant thereof). A reigning prince or duke would also be entitled to some form of the higher style of &quot;Altezza&quot; (eg , ) in addition to the This was how the style was used in the for extant families in its third section focused on the 200 non sovereign princely and ducal families of Europe.

The last official Italian nobility law (abrogated 1948) stated that the style belonged to members of the following groups:
* those whose main title was &quot;principe&quot;, &quot;duca&quot;, &quot;marchese&quot; or &quot;conte&quot; ;
* those who had a special grant;
* those to whom it had been recognized by the former Lombardy (Duchy of Milan); or
* those from the Kingdom of Sardinia who bore either a title of hereditary knight or of the titled nobility (whatever the main title of the family).
Genealogical databases and dynastic works still reserve the title for this class of noble by tradition, although it is no longer a right under Italian law.

In practice, however, the style Don/Donna (or Latin Dominus/Domina) was used more loosely in church, civil and notarial records. The honorific was often accorded to the untitled gentry (e.g., knights or younger sons of noblemen), priests, or other people of distinction. It was, over time, adopted by organized criminal societies in Southern Italy (including Naples, Sicily, and Calabria) to refer to members who held considerable sway within their hierarchies.

In modern Italy, the title is usually only given to Roman Catholic diocesan priests (never to prelates, who bear higher honorifics such as , , and so on). In Sardinia, until recently it was commonly used for nobility (whether titled or not), but it is being presently used mainly when the speaker wants to show that he knows the &#x27;s condition of nobility.

Outside of the priesthood or old nobility, usage is still common in Southern Italy, mostly as an honorific form to address the elderly, but it is rarely, if ever, used in Central Italy or Northern Italy. It can be used satirically or ironically to lampoon a person&#x27;s sense of self-importance.

 is prefixed either to the full name or to the person&#x27;s given name. The form &quot;Don Lastname&quot; for crime bosses (as in &quot;Don Corleone&quot;) is an American custom. In Southern Italy, mafia bosses are addressed as &quot;Don Firstname&quot; by other and sometimes their victims as well, while the press usually refers to them as &quot;Firstname Lastname&quot;, without the honorific.

Priests are the only ones to be referred as &quot;Don&quot; plus the last name (e.g. Don Marioni), although when talking directly to them they are usually addressed as &quot;Don&quot; plus the first name (e.g. Don Francesco), which is also the most common form used by parishioners when referring to their priest.

==Portuguese-speaking countries and territories==
The usage of was a prerogative of princes of royal blood and also of other individuals to whom it had been granted by the sovereign. In most cases, the title was passed on through the male line. Strictly speaking, only females born of a nobleman bearing the title would be addressed as (&#x27;D.ª&#x27;), but the style was not heritable through daughters. The few exceptions depended solely on the conditions upon which the title itself had been granted. A well-known exception is the descent of Dom Vasco da Gama.

There were many cases, both in Portugal and Brazil, in which the title of (or ) was conceded to, and even bought by, people who were not from royalty. In any case, when the title was officially recognized by the proper authority, it became part of the name.

In Portugal and Brazil, () is used for certain higher members hierarchs, such as superiors, of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. In Catholic religious orders, such as the Order of Saint Benedict, it is also associated with the status of Dom Frater. is similarly used as an honorific for Benedictine monks within the Benedictine Order throughout France and the English speaking world, such as the famous &quot;Dom Pérignon&quot;. In France, it is also used within the male branch of the Carthusian Order.

It is also employed for laymen who belong to the royal and imperial families (for example the House of Aviz in Portugal and the House of Braganza in Portugal and Brazil). It was also accorded to members of families of the titled Portuguese nobility. Unless ennobling letters patent specifically authorised its use, was not attributed to members of Portugal&#x27;s untitled nobility: Since hereditary titles in Portugal descended according to primogeniture, the right to the style of was the only apparent distinction between cadets of titled families and members of untitled noble families.

In the Portuguese language, the feminine form, (or, more politely, ), has become common when referring to a woman who does not hold an academic title. It is commonly used to refer to First Ladies, although it is less common for female politicians.

==Croatia==
Within the Catholic Church, the prefix is usually used for the diocesan priests with their first name, as well as (The Reverend).

==Religion==
&quot;Dom&quot; is used as a title in English for certain Benedictine (including some communities which follow the Rule of St. Benedict) and Carthusian monks, and for members of certain communities of canons regular. Examples include Benedictine monks of the English Benedictine Congregation (e.g. Dom John Chapman, late Abbot of Downside). Since the Second Vatican Council, the title can be given to any monk (lay or ordained) who has made a solemn profession. The equivalent title for a nun is &quot;Dame&quot; (e.g. Dame Laurentia McLachlan, late Abbess of Stanbrook, or Dame Felicitas Corrigan, author).

==In popular culture==
In the United States, has also been made popular by films depicting the Italian mafia, such as &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy, where the crime boss is given by his associates the same signs of respect that were traditionally granted in Italy to nobility. However, the honorific followed by the last name (e.g. Don Corleone) would be used in Italy for priests only: the proper Italian respectful form is similar to the Spanish-language form in that it is applied only to the first name (e.g. &quot;Don Vito&quot;). This title has in turn been applied by the media to real-world mafia figures, such as the nickname &quot;Teflon Don&quot; for John Gotti.
It is also used in American TV series Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.

<text>&quot;I&#x27;m a Little Teapot&quot; is an American novelty song describing the heating and pouring of a teapot or a whistling tea kettle. The song was originally written by George Harry Sanders and Clarence Z. Kelley and published in 1939. By 1941, a &quot;Newsweek&quot; article referred to the song as &quot;the next inane novelty song to sweep the country&quot;.

== Creation ==
Kelley and his wife ran a dance school for children, which taught the &quot;Waltz Clog&quot;, a popular and easy-to-learn tap dance routine. This routine, however, proved too difficult for the younger students to master. To solve this problem, George Sanders wrote &quot;The Teapot Song&quot;, which required minimal skill and encouraged natural pantomime. Both the song and its accompanying dance, the &quot;Teapot Tip&quot;, became enormously popular in America and overseas.

The song was recorded and made famous by Art Kassel and His Kassels in the Air orchestra with featured vocalist Marion Holmes singing the tune. It was published in 1941 by Bluebird Records. (Marion Holmes soon after married Broadway, film, and TV star Don DeFore.)

The lyrics begin &quot;I&#x27;m a little teapot, short and stout...&quot; and go on to further describe the appearance and actions of the singer-as-teapot. The song may be accompanied with actions: extending one arm in a curve like the spout, placing the other arm like the handle, and bending sideways to pour.
==Recordings==
&quot;I&#x27;m a Little Teapot&quot; has been recorded by a number of artists, particularly on children&#x27;s albums. It&#x27;s been released as a single by various artists besides Kassel, including Horace Heidt (1941), Lawrence Duchow&#x27;s Red Raven Orchestra (1956), and Two Ton Baker (1947). It&#x27;s included on Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Prokofiev&#x27;s Peter and the Wolf plus 10 More Great Children&#x27;s Favorites&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The song is played extensively in the 1999 horror film miniseries &quot;Storm of the Century&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s Mice&quot; of &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, Brain sings the song itself.

<text>Francoist Spain (), also known as the Francoist dictatorship (), was the period of Spanish history between 1936 and 1975, when Francisco Franco ruled Spain after the Spanish Civil War with the title . Two days after his death in 1975 due to heart failure, Spain transitioned into a democracy. During Franco&#x27;s rule, Spain was officially known as the Spanish State (). The informal term &quot;Fascist Spain&quot; is also used, especially before and during World War II. 

The nature of the regime evolved and changed during its existence. Months after the start of the Civil War in July 1936, Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed head of state on 1 October 1936, ruling a dictatorship over the territory controlled by the Nationalist faction. The 1937 Unification Decree, which merged all parties supporting the rebel side, led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the FET y de las JONS. The end of the Civil War in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the exile of Republican institutions. The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as &quot;fascistized dictatorship&quot;, or &quot;semi-fascist regime&quot;, showing clear influence of fascism in fields such as labor relations, the autarkic economic policy, aesthetics, and the single-party system. As time went on, the regime opened up and became closer to developmental dictatorships, although it always preserved residual fascist trappings.

During World War II, Spain did not join the Axis powers (its supporters from the Civil War, Italy and Germany). Nevertheless, Spain supported them in various ways throughout most of the war while maintaining its neutrality as an official policy of non-belligerence. Because of this, Spain was isolated by many other countries for nearly a decade after World War II, while its autarkic economy, still trying to recover from the Civil War, suffered from chronic depression. The 1947 Law of Succession made Spain a &quot;de jure&quot; kingdom again but defined Franco as the head of state for life with the power to choose the person to become King of Spain and his successor.

Reforms were implemented in the 1950s and Spain abandoned autarky, reassigned authority from the Falangist movement, which had been prone to isolationism, to a new breed of economists, the technocrats of Opus Dei. This led to massive economic growth, second only to Japan, that lasted until the mid-1970s, known as the &quot;Spanish miracle&quot;. During the 1950s, the regime also changed from a rigidly totalitarian and repressive system, called &quot;the First Francoism&quot;, to a slightly milder authoritarian system with limited pluralism and economic freedom. As a result of these reforms, Spain was allowed to join the United Nations in 1955 and Franco was one of Europe&#x27;s foremost anti-communist figures during the Cold War, and his regime was assisted by the Western powers, particularly the United States. Franco died in 1975 at the age of 82. He restored the Spanish monarchy before his death and made his successor King Juan Carlos I, who led the Spanish transition to democracy.

== Establishment ==
On 1 October 1936, Franco was formally recognised as Caudillo of Spain—the Spanish equivalent of the Italian Duce and the German Führer—by the &quot;Junta de Defensa Nacional&quot; (National Defense Junta), which governed the territories occupied by the Nationalists. In April 1937, Franco assumed control of the &quot;Falange Española de las JONS&quot;, then led by Manuel Hedilla, who had succeeded José Antonio Primo de Rivera, who was executed in November 1936 by the Republican government. He merged it with the Carlist &quot;Comunión Tradicionalista&quot; to form the &quot;Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS&quot;. The sole legal party of Francoist Spain, it was the main component of the &quot;Movimiento Nacional&quot; (National Movement). The Falangists were concentrated at local government and grassroot level, entrusted with harnessing the Civil War&#x27;s momentum of mass mobilisation through their auxiliaries and trade unions by collecting denunciations of enemy residents and recruiting workers into the trade unions. While there were prominent Falangists at a senior government level, especially before the late 1940s, there were higher concentrations of monarchists, military officials and other traditional conservative factions at those levels. However, the Falange remained the sole party.

The Francoists took control of Spain through a comprehensive and methodical war of attrition (&quot;guerra de desgaste&quot;) which involved the imprisonment and executions of Spaniards found guilty of supporting the values promoted by the Republic: regional autonomy, liberal or social democracy, free elections, socialist leanings, and women&#x27;s rights, including the vote. The right-wing considered these &quot;enemy elements&quot; to comprise an &quot;anti-Spain&quot; that was the product of Bolsheviks and a &quot;Judeo-Masonic conspiracy&quot;. The latter allegation pre-dated Falangism, having evolved after the &quot;Reconquista&quot; of the Iberian Peninsula from the Islamic Moors. Falangist founder, Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, had a more tolerant position than the national socialists in Germany. This was influenced by the small size of the Jewish community in Spain at the time that did not favor the development of strong antisemitism. Primo de Rivera saw the solution to the &quot;Jewish problem&quot; in Spain as simple: the conversion of Jews to Catholicism.

At the end of the Spanish Civil War, according to the regime&#x27;s own figures there were more than men and women held in prisons and some had fled into exile. Large numbers of those captured were returned to Spain or interned in Nazi concentration camps as stateless enemies. Between six and seven thousand exiles from Spain died in Mauthausen. It has been estimated that more than Spaniards died in the first years of the dictatorship from 1940 to 1942 as a result of political persecution, hunger and disease related to the conflict.

Spain&#x27;s strong ties with the Axis resulted in its international ostracism in the early years following World War II as Spain was not a founding member of the United Nations and did not become a member until 1955. This changed with the Cold War that soon followed the end of hostilities in 1945, in the face of which Franco&#x27;s strong anti-communism naturally tilted its regime to ally with the United States. Independent political parties and trade unions were banned throughout the duration of the dictatorship. Nevertheless, once decrees for economic stabilisation were put forth by the late 1950s, the way was opened for massive foreign investment—&quot;a watershed in post-war economic, social and ideological normalisation leading to extraordinarily rapid economic growth&quot;—that marked Spain&#x27;s &quot;participation in the Europe-wide post-war economic normality centred on mass consumption and consensus, in contrast to the concurrent reality of the Soviet bloc&quot;.

On 26 July 1947, Spain was declared a kingdom, but no monarch was designated until in 1969 Franco established Juan Carlos of Bourbon as his official heir-apparent. Franco was to be succeeded by Luis Carrero Blanco as Prime Minister with the intention of continuing the Francoist regime, but those hopes ended with his 1973 assassination by the Basque separatist group ETA. With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the King of Spain. He initiated the country&#x27;s subsequent transition to democracy, ending with Spain becoming a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament and autonomous devolved governments.

==Government==
After Franco&#x27;s victory in 1939, the Falange was declared the sole legally sanctioned political party in Spain and it asserted itself as the main component of the National Movement. In a state of emergency-like status, Franco ruled with, on paper, more power than any Spanish leader before or since. He was not even required to consult his cabinet for most legislation. According to historian Stanley G. Payne, Franco had more day-to-day power than Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power. Payne noted that Hitler and Stalin at least maintained rubber-stamp parliaments, while Franco dispensed with even that formality in the early years of his rule. According to Payne, the lack of even a rubber-stamp parliament made Franco&#x27;s government &quot;the most purely arbitrary in the world.&quot; The 100-member National Council of the Movement served as a makeshift legislature until the passing of the organic law of 1942 and the &quot;Ley Constitutiva de las Cortes&quot; (Constituent Law of the Cortes) the same year, which saw the grand opening of the Cortes Españolas on 18 July 1942.

The Organic Law made the executive government ultimately responsible for passing all laws, while defining the Cortes as a purely advisory body elected by neither direct nor universal suffrage. The Cortes had no power over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it: ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone as the &quot;Chief&quot; of state and government. The &quot;Ley del Referendum Nacional&quot; (Law of the National Referendum), passed in 1945 approved for all &quot;fundamental laws&quot; to be approved by a popular referendum, in which only the heads of families could vote. Local municipal councils were appointed similarly by heads of families and local corporations through local municipal elections while mayors were appointed by the government. It was thus one of the most centralised countries in Europe and certainly the most centralised in Western Europe following the fall of the Portuguese &quot;Estado Novo&quot; in the Carnation Revolution.

The referendum law was used twice during Franco&#x27;s rule—in 1947, when a referendum revived the Spanish monarchy with Franco as &quot;de facto&quot; regent for life with sole right to appoint his successor; and in 1966, another referendum was held to approve a new &quot;organic law&quot;, or constitution, supposedly limiting and clearly defining Franco&#x27;s powers as well as formally creating the modern office of Prime Minister of Spain. By delaying the issue of republic versus monarchy for his 36-year dictatorship and by refusing to take up the throne himself in 1947, Franco sought to antagonise neither the monarchical Carlists (who preferred the restoration of a Bourbon) nor the republican &quot;old shirts&quot; (original Falangists). Franco ignored the claim to the throne of Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, son of the last king, Alfonso XIII, who designated himself as his heir; Franco found him too liberal. Instead, in 1969, Franco selected the young Juan Carlos of Bourbon, son of Infante Juan, as his officially designated heir to the throne, shortly after his 30th birthday (the minimum age required under the Law of Succession).

In 1973, due to old age and to lessen his burdens in governing Spain he resigned as Prime Minister and named Navy Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco to the said post, but Franco remained as the Chief of State, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and &quot;Jefe del Movimiento&quot; (Chief of the Movement). However, Carrero Blanco was assassinated in the same year and Carlos Arias Navarro became the country&#x27;s new Prime Minister.

==Armed forces==

During the first year of peace, Franco drastically reduced the size of the Spanish Army—from almost one million at the end of the Civil War to in early 1940, with most soldiers two-year conscripts. Concerns about the international situation, Spain&#x27;s possible entry into World War II, and threats of invasion led him to undo some of these reductions. In November 1942, with the Allied landings in North Africa and the German occupation of France bringing hostilities closer than ever to Spain&#x27;s border, Franco ordered a partial mobilization, bringing the army to over men. The Air Force and Navy also grew in numbers and in budgets to airmen and sailors by 1945, although for fiscal reasons Franco had to restrain attempts by both services to undertake dramatic expansions. The army maintained a strength of about men until the end of the Second World War.

==Colonial empire and decolonisation==


Spain attempted to retain control of the last remnants of its colonial empire throughout Franco&#x27;s rule. During the Algerian War (1954–1962), Madrid became the base of the &quot;Organisation armée secrète&quot; right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve French Algeria. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When the French protectorate in Morocco became independent in 1956, Spain surrendered its Spanish protectorate in Morocco to Mohammed V, retaining only a few exclaves, the &quot;Plazas de soberanía&quot;. The year after, Mohammed V invaded Spanish Sahara during the Ifni War (known as the &quot;Forgotten War&quot; in Spain). Only in 1975, with the Green March and the military occupation, did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.

In 1968, under United Nations pressure, Franco granted Spain&#x27;s colony of Equatorial Guinea its independence and the next year ceded the exclave of Ifni to Morocco. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to gain sovereignty of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar and closed its border in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.

==Francoism==


Initially the regime embraced the definition of a &quot;totalitarian state&quot; or the &quot;nacional-sindicalista&quot; label. Following the defeat of Fascism in World War II, was the new moniker the regime adopted for itself, yet it only sounded credible to staunch believers. Other later soft definitions include &quot;authoritarian regime&quot; or &quot;constituent or developmental dictatorship&quot;, the latter having inner backing from within the regime. During the Cold War, Juan José Linz, either accused of whitewashing the regime or being praised as the elaborator of &quot;the first scientific conceptualization&quot; of the regime, famously early characterized it as an &quot;authoritarian regime with limited pluralism&quot;. The Francoist regime has been described by other scholars as a &quot;Fascismo a la española&quot; (&quot;Spanish-style Fascism&quot;) or as a specific variant of Fascism marked by the preponderance of the Catholic Church, the Armed Forces and Traditionalism.

While the regime evolved along with its protracted history, its primitive essence remained, underpinned by the legal concentration of all powers into a single person, Francisco Franco, &quot;&quot;Caudillo&quot; of Spain by the Grace of God&quot;, embodying national sovereignty and &quot;only responsible before God and History&quot;.

The consistent points in Francoism included above all authoritarianism, anti-Communism, Spanish nationalism, national Catholicism, monarchism, militarism, national conservatism, anti-Masonry, anti-Catalanism, pan-Hispanism, and anti-liberalism—some authors also include integralism. Stanley Payne, a scholar of Spain notes that &quot;scarcely any of the serious historians and analysts of Franco consider the &quot;generalissimo&quot; to be a core fascist&quot;. According to historian Walter Laqueur &quot;during the Civil War, Spanish fascists were forced to subordinate their activities to the nationalist cause. At the helm were military leaders such as General Francisco Franco, who were conservatives in all essential respects. When the civil war ended, Franco was so deeply entrenched that the Falange stood no chance; in this strongly authoritarian regime, there was no room for political opposition. The Falange became junior partners in the government and, as such, they had to accept responsibility for the regime&#x27;s policy without being able to shape it substantially&quot;. The United Nations Security Council voted in 1946 to deny the Franco regime recognition until it developed a more representative government.

===Development===
The Falange Española de las JONS, a fascist party formed during the Republic, soon transformed itself into the framework of reference in the National Movement. In April 1937, the &quot;Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista&quot; (Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx and of the Councils of National Syndicalist Offensive) was created from the absorption of the &quot;Comunión Tradicionalista&quot; (Traditionalist Communion) by the &quot;Falange Española de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista&quot;, which itself was the result of an earlier absorption of the &quot;Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista&quot; by José Antonio Primo de Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Falange Española&quot;. This party, often referred to as Falange, became the sole legal party during Franco&#x27;s regime, but the term &quot;party&quot; was generally avoided, especially after World War II, when it was commonly referred to as the &quot;National Movement&quot; or just as &quot;the Movement&quot;.

===Fascism and authoritarianism===
The main point of those scholars that tend to consider the Spanish State to be authoritarian rather than fascist is that the FET-JONS were relatively heterogeneous rather than being an ideological monolith. Other historians have argued that if it was not fascist, then it at least has a strong fascist component, and they described it as a regime of unfinished fascization and later de-fascisation or as a para-fascism. Paul Preston described the regime as a specific kind of fascism lacking Fascist &quot;style and ideology&quot;, but serving the fascist &quot;social and economic function&quot;. After World War II, the Falange opposed free capital markets, but the ultimately prevailing technocrats, some of whom were linked with Opus Dei, eschewed syndicalist economics and favoured increased competition as a means of achieving rapid economic growth and integration with wider Europe.

The Spanish State has been described as authoritarian and, during the first ten to twenty years of the First Francoism, totalitarian: non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the political spectrum were either suppressed or controlled by all means, including police repression. Most country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot;, a military police for civilians, which functioned as a chief means of social control. Larger cities, and capitals, were mostly under the heavily armed &quot;Policía Armada&quot;, commonly called &quot;grises&quot; due to their grey uniforms. Franco was also the focus of a personality cult, which taught that he had been sent by Divine Providence to save the country from chaos and poverty. While Enrique Moradiellos states that &quot;it is now increasingly rare to define Francoism as a truly fascist and totalitarian regime&quot;, although he writes that the debates on Francoism haven&#x27;t finished yet, Ismael Saz notes that &quot;it has also begun to be recognised that&quot; Francoism underwent a &quot;totalitarian or quasi-totalitarian, fascist or quasi-fascist&quot; phase. To historians who defend the label &quot;totalitarian&quot;, it is &quot;more than evident that Franco&#x27;s regime in the first twenty years had totalizing pretensions in relation to social control (including private life, morality and customs), the monopoly of politics and public space, and even the control of the economy (think of the strong interventionism of autarky)&quot; and that it generally corresponded to the concept of totalitarianism as formulated by Hannah Arendt.

Members of the oppressed ranged from Catholic trade unions to communist and anarchist organisations to liberal democrats and Catalan or Basque separatists. The &quot;Confederación Nacional del Trabajo&quot; (CNT) and the &quot;Unión General de Trabajadores&quot; (UGT) trade unions were outlawed and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist &quot;Sindicato Vertical&quot;. The Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) and the &quot;Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya&quot; (ERC) party were banned in 1939 while the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) went underground. University students seeking democracy revolted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which was repressed by the &quot;grises&quot;. The Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) went into exile and in 1959 the armed separatist group ETA was created to wage a low-intensity war against Franco. Like others at the time, Franco evinced a concern about a possible Masonic and Judaic conspiracy against his regime.

Franco continued to personally sign all death warrants until just months before he died despite international campaigns requesting him to desist.

===Spanish nationalism===

Franco&#x27;s Spanish nationalism promoted a Castilian-centric unitary national identity by repressing Spain&#x27;s cultural diversity. Bullfighting and flamenco were promoted as national traditions, while those traditions not considered Spanish were suppressed. Franco&#x27;s view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, Flamenco, an Andalusian tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship and many were forbidden entirely, often in an erratic manner. This cultural policy relaxed over time, most notably in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Franco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised form of government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the House of Bourbon and General Miguel Primo de Rivera. These structures were modelled after the centralised French state. As a result of this type of governance, government attention and initiatives were irregular and often depended more on the goodwill of government representatives than on regional needs. Thus inequalities in schooling, health care or transport facilities among regions were patent: historically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia or the Basque Country fared much better than others such as Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia.

Franco eliminated the autonomy granted by the Second Spanish Republic to the regions and abolished the centuries-old fiscal privileges and autonomy (the fueros) in two of the three Basque provinces: Guipuzcoa and Biscay, which were officially classified as &quot;traitor regions&quot;. The fueros were kept in the third Basque province, Alava, and also in Navarre, a former kingdom during the Middle Ages and the cradle of the Carlists, possibly due to the region&#x27;s support during the Civil War.

Franco also used language politics in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. Despite Franco himself being Galician, the government revoked the official statute and recognition for the Basque, Galician and Catalan languages that the Republic had granted them for the first time in the history of Spain. The former policy of promoting Spanish as the only official language of the state and education was resumed, even though millions of the country&#x27;s citizens spoke other languages. The legal usage of languages other than Spanish was forbidden: all government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Spanish and any written in other languages were deemed null and void. The use of any other language was forbidden in schools, advertising, religious ceremonies and on-road and shop signs. Publications in other languages were generally forbidden, though citizens continued to use them privately. During the late 1960s, these policies became more lenient yet non-Castilian languages continued to be discouraged and did not receive official status or legal recognition. Additionally, the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and exclusively in Spanish, reduced the competency of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician.

===Roman Catholicism===
Franco&#x27;s regime often used religion as a means to increase his popularity throughout the Catholic world, especially after the Second World War. Franco himself was increasingly portrayed as a fervent Catholic and a staunch defender of Roman Catholicism, the declared state religion. The regime favoured very conservative Roman Catholicism and it reversed the secularisation process that had taken place under the Republic. According to historian Julian Casanova, &quot;the symbiosis of religion, fatherland and Caudillo&quot; saw the Church assume great political responsibilities, &quot;a hegemony and monopoly beyond its wildest dreams&quot; and it played &quot;a central role in policing the country&#x27;s citizens&quot;.
The Law of Political Responsibility of February 1939 turned the Church into an extralegal body of investigation as parishes were granted policing powers equal to those of local government officials and leaders of the Falange. Some official jobs required a &quot;good behaviour&quot; statement by a priest. According to historian Julian Casanova, &quot;the reports that have survived reveal a clergy that was bitter because of the violent anti-clericalism and the unacceptable level of secularisation that Spanish society had reached during the republican years&quot; and the law of 1939 made the priests investigators of peoples&#x27; ideological and political pasts.

The authorities encouraged denunciations in the workplace. For example, Barcelona&#x27;s city hall obliged all government functionaries to &quot;tell the proper authorities who the leftists are in your department and everything you know about their activities&quot;. A law passed in 1939 institutionalised the purging of public offices. The poet Carlos Barral recorded that in his family &quot;any allusion to republican relatives was scrupulously avoided; everyone took part in the enthusiasm for the new era and wrapped themselves in the folds of religiosity&quot;. Only through silence could people associated with the Republic be relatively safe from imprisonment or unemployment. After the death of Franco, the price of the peaceful transition to democracy would be silence and &quot;the tacit agreement to forget the past&quot;, which was given legal status by the 1977 Pact of forgetting.

Civil marriages that had taken place in the Republic were declared null and void unless they had been validated by the Church, along with divorces. Divorce, contraception and abortions were forbidden. Children had to be given Christian names. Franco was made a member of the Supreme Order of Christ by Pope Pius XII whilst Spain itself was consecrated to the Sacred Heart.

The Catholic Church&#x27;s ties with the Franco dictatorship gave it control over the country&#x27;s schools and crucifixes were once again placed in schoolrooms. After the war, Franco chose José Ibáñez Martín, a member of the National Catholic Association of Propagandists, to lead the Ministry of Education. He held the post for 12 years, during which he finished the purging of the ministry begun by the Commission of Culture and Teaching headed by José María Pemán. Pemán led the Catholicizing state-sponsored schools and allocating generous funding to the Church&#x27;s schools. Romualdo de Toledo, head of the National Service of Primary Education, was a traditionalist who described the model school as &quot;the monastery founded by Saint Benedict&quot;. The clergy in charge of the education system sanctioned and sacked thousands of teachers of the progressive left and divided Spain&#x27;s schools up among the families of falangists, loyalist soldiers and Catholic families. In some provinces, like Lugo, practically all the teachers were dismissed. This process also affected tertiary education, as Ibáñez Martín, Catholic propagandists and the Opus Dei ensured professorships were offered only to the most faithful.
The orphaned children of &quot;Reds&quot; were taught in orphanages run by priests and nuns that &quot;their parents had committed great sins that they could help expiate, for which many were incited to serve the Church&quot;.

Francoism professed a strong devotion to militarism, hypermasculinity and the traditional role of women in society. A woman was to be loving to her parents and brothers, faithful to her husband and to reside with her family. Official propaganda confined women&#x27;s roles to family care and motherhood. Most progressive laws passed by the Second Republic were declared void. Women could not become judges, or testify in the trial. They could not become university professors. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was increasing liberalization, yet such measures would continue until Franco&#x27;s death.

In 1947, Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy through the &quot;Ley de Sucesión en la Jefatura del Estado&quot; act, but did not designate a monarch. He had no particular desire for a king because of his strained relations with the legitimist heir to the Crown, Juan of Bourbon. Therefore, he left the throne vacant with himself as regent and set the basis for his succession. This gesture was largely done to appease monarchist factions within the Movement. At the same time, Franco wore the uniform of a captain-general (a rank traditionally reserved for the King), resided in the Royal Palace of El Pardo, appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a canopy and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were &quot;Jefe del Estado&quot; (Head of State) and &quot;Generalísimo de los Ejércitos Españoles&quot; (Generalissimo of the Spanish Armies), he was referred to as Caudillo of Spain, by the Grace of God. &quot;Por la Gracia de Dios&quot; is a technical, legal formulation which states sovereign dignity in absolute monarchies and had been used only by monarchs before.

The long-delayed selection of Juan Carlos of Bourbon as Franco&#x27;s official successor in 1969 was an unpleasant surprise for many interested parties as Juan Carlos was the rightful heir for neither the Carlists nor the Legitimists.

=== Women in Francoist Spain ===
Women had first been granted the right to vote in Spain during the Second Republic. Under the new constitution they had gained full legal status and equal access to the labor market, abortion had been legalized and the crime of adultery abolished.

The Franco regime&#x27;s embrace of National Catholicism (&quot;nacionalcatolicismo&quot;) as part of its ideological identity meant that the Catholic Church, which traditionally supported the social subordination of women, had preeminence in all aspects of public and private life in Spain. The Catholic Church had a central role in upholding the traditional role of the family and women&#x27;s place in it. Civil marriage had also been introduced in the country during the Republic, so the Church immediately asked the new Franco regime to restore its control of family and marriage laws. All Spanish women were required by the state to serve for six months in the Women&#x27;s Section (&quot;Sección Femenina&quot;), the female branch of the Falange state party, to undergo training for motherhood along with political indoctrination.

Francoism professed a devotion to the traditional role of a woman in society; that is, being a loving daughter and sister to her parents and brothers, being a faithful wife to her husband, and residing with her family. Official propaganda confined the role of women to family care and motherhood. Immediately after the civil war most progressive laws passed by the Republic aimed at equality between the sexes were nullified. Women could not become judges or testify in a trial. Their affairs and economic lives had to be managed by their fathers and husbands. Until the 1970s, a woman could not open a bank account without having it co-signed by her father or husband. In the 1960s and 1970s these restrictions were somewhat relaxed.

However, from 1941 until well into the Spanish transition to democracy, the Women&#x27;s Protection Board confined ten of thousands of girls and young women deemed &#x27;fallen or at risk of falling&#x27;, even without having committed any crime, in centers run by Catholic religious orders where they were routinely brutalized. They could be admitted to these centers starting at age 16 through police raids, for &quot;immoral behavior,&quot; arbitrary reports from family members and individuals (&quot;guardians of morals&quot;), requests from civil and religious authorities, or at the request of the women themselves or their parents. In practice, girls as young as 11 were forcibly interned. Young women and girls were routinely trafficked to men and forced to bear children, only to have their babies stolen immediately afterwards.

=== Homophobia ===
Francoist Spain was strongly homophobic, sharing the hardline anti-LGBT stance of the Catholic Church and criminalising and heavily suppressing homosexual activity. In spite of this persecution, an active, albeit clandestine, homosexual movement existed within Spain that maintained ties to queer communities in Latin America.

===Influence abroad===
Argentine General Juan Carlos Onganía modelled his short-lived military regime (1966–1970) after Francoist Spain. Across the Andes Francoism had an influence in Chile, where it found clear expressions in the military dictatorship era (1973–1990), in particular in the period prior to 1980. Chilean figures linked to Francoism include Traditionalist historian Jaime Eyzaguirre and lawyer Jaime Guzmán. Guzman&#x27;s Guildist Movement, the Constitution of Chile of 1980, the political party Independent Democratic Union founded in 1983, the University of the Andes established in 1989 and the presence of Opus Dei in Chile represent a continuing Francoist heritage. In politics Francoist influence gave way to economic liberalism after 1980.

In the magazine &quot;Portada&quot; (1969–1976) Chilean traditionalist and conservative intellectuals repeatedly expressed sympathy for ideas associated with Francoism such as rooted in Medieval institutions and &quot;Hispanic conservatism&quot;.

==Narrative of the Civil War==
For nearly twenty years after the war, Francoist Spain presented the conflict as a crusade against Bolshevism in defence of Christian civilization. In Francoist narrative, authoritarianism had defeated anarchy and overseen the elimination of &quot;agitators&quot;, those &quot;without God&quot; and the &quot;Judeo-Masonic conspiracy&quot;. Since Franco had relied on thousands of North African soldiers, anti-Islamic sentiment &quot;was played down but the centuries-old myth of the Moorish threat lay at the base of the construction of the &quot;communist menace&quot; as a modern-day Eastern plague&quot;. The official position was therefore that the wartime Republic was simply a proto-Stalinist monolith, its leaders intent on creating a Spanish Soviet satellite. Many Spanish children grew up believing the war was fought against foreigners and the painter Julian Grau Santos has said &quot;it was instilled in me and I always believed that Spain had won the war against foreign enemies of our historic greatness&quot;. About Catholic clergy were murdered by the Republicans. Collectively, they are known as the martyrs of the Spanish Civil War.

==Media==

Under the 1938 Press Law, all newspapers were put under prior censorship and were forced to include any articles the government desired. Chief editors were nominated by the government and all journalists were required to be registered. All liberal, republican and left-wing media were prohibited.

The &quot;Delegación Nacional de Prensa y Propaganda&quot; was established as a network of government media, including daily newspapers &quot;Diario Arriba&quot; and &quot;Pueblo&quot;. The &quot;EFE&quot; and Pyresa government news agencies were created in 1939 and 1945. The &quot;Radio Nacional de España&quot; state radio had the exclusive right to transmit news bulletins, which all broadcasters were required to air. The No-Do were 10-minute newsreels shown at all cinemas. The &quot;Televisión Española&quot;, the government television network, debuted in 1956.

The Roman Catholic Church had its own media outlets, including the Ya newspaper and the &quot;Cadena COPE&quot; radio network. Other pro-government media included &quot;Cadena SER&quot;, &quot;ABC&quot;, &quot;La Vanguardia Española&quot;, &quot;El Correo&quot; and &quot;El Diario Vasco&quot;.

Notable independent media outlets included humour magazine &quot;La Codorniz&quot;.

The 1966 Press Law dropped the prior censorship regime and allowed media outlets to select their own directors, although criticism was still a crime.

==Central administration==

There were 119 individuals (plus Franco) holding ministerial jobs during the dictatorship. Most of the ministers came from Madrid, and in proportion to the entire population New Castile (of which Madrid formed part administrationwise) was heavily overrepresented. Other overrepresented regions were (sequentially) Navarre, Vasconia, Asturias, Galicia and Aragon; the most underrepresented regions were (also sequentially) Baleares, Murcia, Extremadura, and Valencia. In terms of jobs, most ministers (32) were professional specialists (engineers, doctors, lawyers), followed by military men (26), businessmen (14) and state employees (10). Some 71% held a university degree, and 28% graduated from military academies. Members of nobility formed some 6%, the lowest level in Spain until then. Only 9% had earlier parliamentary experience, the lowest level until transition to democracy. When assuming office, 41% were aged 40–49, 28% were aged 50–59, 24% were 60 or above and 7% were below 40. Some 36% held the office between 1 and 4 years, 29% between 4 and 8 years, and 23% longer than 8 years, with the average far ahead of this for any of the previous periods. The Franco period marked also the lowest-ever (including post-1978 era) mobility across portfolios, as 85% of ministers held only one.

The longest-serving individuals and the longest ministerial spells are as below:
==Economy==

The Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco&#x27;s victory, the economy improved little. Franco initially pursued a policy of autarky, cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.

In 1940, the &quot;Sindicato Vertical&quot; was created. It was inspired by the ideas of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, who thought that class struggle would be ended by grouping together workers and owners according to corporative principles. It was the only legal trade union and was under government control. Other trade unions were forbidden and strongly repressed along with political parties outside the Falange.

The Francoist agrarian colonisation was one of the most ambitious programs related to the regime&#x27;s agrarian policies, which were an answer to the Republic&#x27;s Law of Agrarian Reform and the war-time collectivizations. Somewhat inspired by the brief points related to agrarian policy of FE de las JONS, the Francoist colonisation underpinned a materialisation of the agrarian policies vowed by Fascism (connected to the Italian &quot;Bonifica integrale&quot; or the agrarian policy elements of the Nazi &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;). The policy was carried out by the Instituto Nacional de Colonización (INC), created in 1939 with the goal of agricultural modernisation by means of the creation of irrigated lands, improvements in agrarian technology and training and the installment of settlers. It consolidated the privileges of the landowning classes, protecting to a large extent the large landowners from potential expropriations (&quot;tierras reservadas&quot; where large landowners owners retained land property and were transformed into irrigated lands with help from the INC vs the comparatively smaller &quot;tierras en exceso&quot;, purchased or expropriated and where settlers installed). While its inception dates to the period of hegemony of Fascist powers in Europe, the plan did not fully take off until the 1950s. From 1940 to 1970 around 300 colonisation settlements were created.

On the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the United States (including about $1.5 billion in aid 1954–1964), the IMF and technocrats from Opus Dei managed to &quot;convince&quot; the regime to liberalize the economy in 1959 in what amounted to a mini coup d&#x27;état which removed the old guard in charge of the economy, despite the opposition of Franco. However, this economic liberalisation was not accompanied by political reforms and oppression continued unabated.

Economic growth picked up after 1959 after Franco took authority away from these ideologues and gave more power to the liberal technocrats. The country implemented several development policies and growth took off, creating the &quot;Spanish Miracle&quot;. Concurrent with the absence of social reforms and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to European countries and to a lesser extent to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways: the country got rid of surplus population and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.

During the 1960s, Spain experienced further increases in wealth. International firms established their factories in Spain. Spain became the second-fastest-growing economy in the world, alongside Brazil and just behind Japan. The rapid development of this period became known as the &quot;Spanish Miracle&quot;. At the time of Franco&#x27;s death, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe, but the gap between its GDP per capita and that of the major Western European economies had greatly narrowed. In world terms, Spain was already enjoying a fairly high material standard of living with basic but comprehensive services. However, the period between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s was to prove difficult as in addition to the oil shocks to which Spain was highly exposed, the settling of the new political order took priority over the modernising of the economy.

==Legacy==

In Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial. In Germany, a squadron named after Werner Mölders has been renamed because as a pilot he led the escorting units in the bombing of Guernica. As recently as 2006, the BBC reported that Maciej Giertych, an MEP of the right-wing League of Polish Families, had expressed admiration for Franco&#x27;s stature who he believed had &quot;guaranteed the maintenance of traditional values in Europe&quot;.

Spanish opinion has changed. Most statues of Franco and other public Francoist symbols have been removed, and the last Franco statue in Madrid came down in 2005. Additionally, the Permanent Commission of the European Parliament &quot;firmly&quot; condemned in a resolution unanimously adopted in March 2006 the &quot;multiple and serious violations&quot; of human rights committed in Spain under the Francoist regime from 1939 to 1975. The resolution was at the initiative of the MEP Leo Brincat and of the historian Luis María de Puig and is the first international official condemnation of the repression enacted by Franco&#x27;s regime. The resolution also urged to provide public access to historians (professional and amateurs) to the various archives of the Francoist regime, including those of the &quot;Fundación Francisco Franco&quot;, which as well as other Francoist archives remain as of 2006 inaccessible to the public. Furthermore, it urged the Spanish authorities to set up an underground exhibition in the Valley of the Fallen in order to explain the terrible conditions in which it was built. Finally, it proposed the construction of monuments to commemorate Franco&#x27;s victims in Madrid and other important cities.

In Spain, a commission to restore the dignity of the victims of Franco&#x27;s regime and pay tribute to their memory (&quot;comisión para reparar la dignidad y restituir la memoria de las víctimas del franquismo&quot;) was approved in the summer of 2004 and was directed by the then-Vice President María Teresa Fernández de la Vega. Because of his repressive regional linguistic policies, Franco&#x27;s memory is still particularly resented in Catalonia and the Basque Country. The Basque Provinces and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War, as well as during his regime.

In 2008, the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory initiated a systematic search for mass graves of people executed during Franco&#x27;s regime, a move supported since the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s victory during the 2004 elections by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&#x27;s government. The Historical Memory Law (&quot;Ley de Memoria Histórica&quot;) was passed in 2007 as an attempt to enforce official recognition of the crimes committed against civilians during Franco&#x27;s rule and to organise under state supervision the search for mass graves.

Investigations have begun into wide-scale child abduction during the Franco years. The number of lost children of Francoism may reach 300,000.

==Flags and heraldry==
===Flags===

At the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War and in spite of the army&#x27;s reorganisation, several sections of the army continued with their bi-colour flags improvised in 1936, but since 1940 new ensigns began to be distributed, whose main innovation was the addition of the eagle of Saint John to the shield. The new arms were allegedly inspired in the coat of arms the Catholic Monarchs adopted after the taking of Emirate of Granada from the Moors, but replacing the arms of Sicily with those of Navarre and adding the Pillars of Hercules on either side of the coat of arms. In 1938, the columns were placed outside the wings. On 26 July 1945, the commander&#x27;s ensigns were suppressed by decree and on 11 October a detailed regulation of flags was published that fixed the model of the bi-colour flag in use, but better defined its details, emphasising a greater style of the Saint John&#x27;s eagle. The models established by this decree remained in force until 1977.

During this period, two more flags were usually displayed along with the national flag: the flag of Falange (red, black and red vertical stripes, with the yokes and arrows in the centre of the black stripe) and the traditionalist flag (white background with the Cross of Burgundy in the middle), representing the National Movement which had unified Falange and the Requetés under the name &quot;Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS&quot;.

From the death of Franco in 1975 until 1977, the national flag followed the 1945 regulations. On 21 January 1977, a new regulation was approved that stipulated an eagle with more open wings, with the restored Pillars of Hercules placed within the wings and the tape with the motto &quot;Una, Grande y Libre&quot; (&quot;One, Great and Free&quot;) moved over the eagle&#x27;s head from its previous position around the neck.


===Standards===

From 1940 to 1975, Franco used the Royal Bend of Castile as Head of State&#x27;s standard and guidon: the Bend between the Pillars of Hercules, crowned with an imperial crown and open royal crown.

As Prince of Spain from 1969 to 1975, Juan Carlos used a royal standard which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he became King in 1975. The earlier standard differed only that it featured the royal crown of a Crown Prince, the King&#x27;s royal crown has 8 arches of which 5 are visible, while the Prince&#x27;s one has only 4 arches of which 3 are visible. The Royal Standard of Spain consists of a dark blue square with the coat of arms in the centre. The King&#x27;s guidon is identical to the standard.

===Coat of arms===

In 1938, Franco adopted a variant of the coat of arms reinstating some elements originally used by the House of Trastámara such as Saint John&#x27;s eagle and the yoke and arrows as follows: &quot;Quarterly, 1 and 4. quarterly Castile and León, 2 and 3. per pale Aragon and Navarra, enté en point of Granada. The arms are crowned with an open royal crown, placed on eagle displayed sable, surrounded with the pillars of Hercules, the yoke and the bundle of arrows of the Catholic Monarchs&quot;.

<text>Johann Gottfried von Herder ( ; ; 25 August 174418 December 1803) was a Prussian philosopher, theologian, pastor, poet, and literary critic. He is associated with the Enlightenment, &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;, and Weimar Classicism. He was a Romantic philosopher and poet who argued that true German culture was to be discovered among the common people (&quot;das Volk&quot;). He also stated that it was through folk songs, folk poetry, and folk dances that the true spirit of the nation (&quot;der Volksgeist&quot;) was popularized. He is credited with establishing or advancing a number of important disciplines: hermeneutics, linguistics, anthropology, and &quot;a secular philosophy of history.&quot; 

==Biography==
Born in Mohrungen (now Morąg, Poland) in the Kingdom of Prussia, his parents were teacher Gottfried Herder (1706–1763) and his wife Anna Elizabeth Herder, nee Peltz (1717–1772) grew up in a poor household, educating himself from his father&#x27;s Bible and songbook. In 1762, as a youth of 17, he enrolled at the University of Königsberg, about 60 miles (100 km) north of Mohrungen, where he became a student of Immanuel Kant. At the same time, Herder became an intellectual protégé of Johann Georg Hamann, a Königsberg philosopher who disputed the claims of pure secular reason.

Hamann&#x27;s influence led Herder to confess to his wife later in life that &quot;I have too little reason and too much idiosyncrasy&quot;, yet Herder can justly claim to have founded a new school of German political thought. Although himself an unsociable person, Herder influenced his contemporaries greatly. One friend wrote to him in 1785, hailing his works as &quot;inspired by God.&quot; A varied field of theorists were later to find inspiration in Herder&#x27;s tantalizingly incomplete ideas.

In 1764, now a Lutheran pastor, Herder went to Riga to teach. It was during this period that he produced his first major works, which were literary criticism. In 1769 Herder traveled by ship to the French port of Nantes and continued on to Paris. This resulted in both an account of his travels as well as a shift of his own self-conception as an author. By 1770 Herder went to Strasbourg, where he met the young Goethe. This event proved to be a key juncture in the history of German literature, as Goethe was inspired by Herder&#x27;s literary criticism to develop his own style. This can be seen as the beginning of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement. In 1771 Herder took a position as head pastor and court preacher at Bückeburg under William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe.

By the mid-1770s, Goethe was a well-known author, and used his influence at the court of Weimar to secure Herder a position as General Superintendent. Herder moved there in 1776, where his outlook shifted again towards classicism.

On 2 May 1773 Herder married Maria Karoline Flachsland (1750–1809) in Darmstadt. His son Gottfried (1774–1806) was born in Bückeburg. His second son August (1776–1838) was also born in Bückeburg. His third son Wilhelm Ludwig Ernst was born 1778. His fourth son Karl Emil Adelbert (1779–1857) was born in Weimar. In 1781 his daughter Luise (1781–1860) was born, also in Weimar. His fifth son Emil Ernst Gottfried (1783–1855). In 1790 his sixth son Rinaldo Gottfried was born.

Towards the end of his career, Herder endorsed the French Revolution, which earned him the enmity of many of his colleagues. At the same time, he and Goethe experienced a personal split. His unpopular attacks on Kantian philosophy were another reason for his isolation in later years.

In 1802 Herder was ennobled by the Elector-Prince of Bavaria, which added the prefix &quot;von&quot; to his last name. He died in Weimar in 1803 at age 59.

==Works and ideas==
Herder was influenced by his academic advisor Immanuel Kant, as well as seventeenth-century philosophers Spinoza and Leibniz. In turn, he influenced Hegel, Nietzsche, Goethe, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Stuart Mill, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Franz Boas, and Walter Rauschenbusch among others.

In 1772, Herder published &quot;Treatise on the Origin of Language&quot; and went further in this promotion of language than his earlier anti-French injunction to &quot;spew out the ugly slime of the Seine. Speak German, O You German&quot;. Herder now had established the foundations of comparative philology within the new currents of political outlook.

Herder wrote an important essay on Shakespeare and &quot;Auszug aus einem Briefwechsel über Ossian und die Lieder alter Völker&quot; (Extract from a correspondence about Ossian and the Songs of Ancient Peoples) published in 1773 in a manifesto along with contributions by Goethe and Justus Möser. Herder wrote that &quot;A poet is the creator of the nation around him, he gives them a world to see and has their souls in his hand to lead them to that world.&quot; To him such poetry had its greatest purity and power in nations before they became civilised, as shown in the Old Testament, the Edda, and Homer, and he tried to find such virtues in ancient German folk songs and Norse poetry and mythology. Herder – most pronouncedly after Georg Forster&#x27;s 1791 translation of the Sanskrit play &quot;Shakuntala&quot; – was influenced by the religious imagery of Hinduism and Indian literature, which he saw in a positive light, writing several essays on the topic and the preface to the 1803 edition of &quot;Shakuntala&quot;.

After becoming General Superintendent in 1776, Herder&#x27;s philosophy shifted again towards classicism, and he produced works such as his unfinished &quot;Outline of a Philosophical History of Humanity&quot;, which largely originated the school of historical thought. Herder&#x27;s philosophy was of a deeply subjective turn, stressing influence by physical and historical circumstance upon human development, stressing that &quot;one must go into the age, into the region, into the whole history, and feel one&#x27;s way into everything&quot;. The historian should be the &quot;regenerated contemporary&quot; of the past, and history a science as &quot;instrument of the most genuine patriotic spirit&quot;.

Germans did not have a nation-state until the nineteenth century. Those who spoke Germanic languages lived in politically unconnected lands and groups. Herder was among the first German intellectuals to craft a foundation for German cultural unification and German national consciousness based mostly on German language and literature. While rationality was the prime value of Enlightenment philosophers, Herder&#x27;s appeal to sentiment places him within German Romantiscm. He gave Germans new pride in their origins, modifying that dominance of regard allotted to Greek art (&quot;Greek revival&quot;) extolled among others by Johann Joachim Winckelmann and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. He remarked that he would have wished to be born in the Middle Ages and mused whether &quot;the times of the Swabian emperors&quot; did not &quot;deserve to be set forth in their true light in accordance with the German mode of thought?&quot;. Herder equated the German with the Gothic and favored Dürer and everything Gothic. As with the sphere of art, he also proclaimed a national message within the sphere of language. He topped the line of German authors emanating from Martin Opitz, who had written his &quot;Aristarchus, sive de contemptu linguae Teutonicae&quot; in latin in 1617, urging Germans to glory in their hitherto despised language. Herder&#x27;s extensive collections of folk-poetry began a great craze in Germany for that neglected topic.

Herder was one of the first to argue that language contributes to shaping the frameworks and the patterns with which each linguistic community thinks and feels. For Herder, language is &quot;the organ of thought.&quot; This has often been misinterpreted, however. Neither Herder nor the great philosopher of language, Wilhelm von Humboldt, argue that language (written or oral) determines thought. Rather, language was the appropriation of the outer world within the human mind by means of distinguishing marks (&quot;merkmale&quot;). In positing his arguments, Herder reformulated an example from works by Moses Mendelssohn and Thomas Abbt. In his conjectural narrative of human origins, Herder argued that, although linguistic morphemes and logographs did not determine thought, the first humans perceived sheep and their bleating, or subjects and corresponding &quot;Merkmale&quot;, as one and the same. That is, for these conjectured ancestors, the sheep were the bleating, and vice-versa. Hence, prelinguistic thought did not figure largely in Herderian conjectural narratives. Herder even moved beyond his narrative of human origins to contend that if active reflection (&quot;besonnenheit&quot;) and language persisted in human consciousness, then human impulses to signify were immanent in the pasts, presents, and futures of humanity. Avi Lifschitz subsequently reframed Herder&#x27;s &quot;the organ of thought&quot; quotation: &quot;Herder&#x27;s equation of word and idea, of language and cognition, prompted a further attack on any attribution of the first words to the imitation of natural sounds, to the physiology of the vocal organs, or to social convention… [Herder argued] for the linguistic character of our cognition but also for the cognitive nature of human language. One could not think without language, as various Enlightenment thinkers argued, but at the same time one could not properly speak without perceiving the world in a uniquely human way… man would not be himself without language and active reflection, while language deserved its name only as a cognitive aspect of the entire human being.&quot; In response to criticism of these contentions, Herder resisted descriptions of his findings as &quot;conjectural&quot; pasts, casting his arguments for a dearth of cognition in humans and &quot;the problem of the origin of language as a synchronic issue rather than a diachronic one.&quot;

And in this sense, when Humboldt argues that all thinking is thinking in language, he is perpetuating the Herderian tradition. Herder additionally advanced select notions of myriad &quot;authentic&quot; conceptions of &quot;Völk&quot; and the unity of the individual and natural law, which became fodder for his self-proclaimed twentieth-century disciples. Herderian ideas continue to influence thinkers, linguists and anthropologists, and they have often been considered central to the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis and Franz Boas&#x27; coalescence of comparative linguistics and historical particularism with a neo-Kantian/Herderian four-field approach to the study of all cultures, as well as, more recently, anthropological studies by Dell Hymes. Herder&#x27;s focus upon language and cultural traditions as the ties that create a &quot;nation&quot; extended to include folklore, dance, music and art, and inspired Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in their collection of German folk tales. Arguably, the greatest inheritor of Herder&#x27;s linguistic philosophy was Wilhelm von Humboldt. Humboldt&#x27;s great contribution lay in developing Herder&#x27;s idea that language is &quot;the organ of thought&quot; into his own belief that languages were specific worldviews (&quot;Weltansichten&quot;), as Jürgen Trabant argues in the Wilhelm von Humboldt lectures on the Rouen Ethnolinguistics Project website.

Herder attached exceptional importance to the concept of nationality and of patriotism&quot;he that has lost his patriotic spirit has lost himself and the whole worlds about himself&quot;, whilst teaching that &quot;in a certain sense every human perfection is national&quot;. Herder carried folk theory to an extreme by maintaining that &quot;there is only one class in the state, the &quot;Volk&quot;, (not the rabble), and the king belongs to this class as well as the peasant&quot;. Explanation that the &quot;Volk&quot; was not the rabble was a novel conception in this era, and with Herder can be seen the emergence of &quot;the people&quot; as the basis for the emergence of a classless but hierarchical national body.

The nation, however, was individual and separate, distinguished, to Herder, by climate, education, foreign intercourse, tradition and heredity. Providence he praised for having &quot;wonderfully separated nationalities not only by woods and mountains, seas and deserts, rivers and climates, but more particularly by languages, inclinations and characters&quot;. Herder praised the tribal outlook writing that &quot;the savage who loves himself, his wife and child with quiet joy and glows with limited activity of his tribe as for his own life is in my opinion a more real being than that cultivated shadow who is enraptured with the shadow of the whole species&quot;, isolated since &quot;each nationality contains its centre of happiness within itself, as a bullet the centre of gravity&quot;. With no need for comparison since &quot;every nation bears in itself the standard of its perfection, totally independent of all comparison with that of others&quot; for &quot;do not nationalities differ in everything, in poetry, in appearance, in tastes, in usages, customs and languages? Must not religion which partakes of these also differ among the nationalities?&quot;

Following a trip to Ukraine, Herder wrote a prediction in his diary (&quot;Journal meiner Reise im Jahre 1769&quot;) that Slavic nations would one day be the real power in Europe, as the western Europeans would reject Christianity and rot away, while the eastern European nations would retain their religion and their idealism, and would this way become the power in Europe. More specifically, he praised Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;beautiful skies, blithe temperament, musical talent, bountiful soil, etc.… someday will awaken there a cultured nation whose influence will spread… throughout the world.&quot; One of his related predictions was that the Hungarian nation would disappear and become assimilated by surrounding Slavic peoples; this prophecy caused considerable uproar in Hungary and is widely cited to this day.

===Germany and the Enlightenment===
This question was further developed by Herder&#x27;s lament that Martin Luther did not establish a national church, and his doubt whether Germany did not buy Christianity at too high a price, that of true nationality. Herder&#x27;s patriotism bordered at times upon national pantheism, demanding of territorial unity as &quot;He is deserving of glory and gratitude who seeks to promote the unity of the territories of Germany through writings, manufacture, and institutions&quot; and sounding an even deeper call:

In his &quot;Ideas upon Philosophy and the History of Mankind&quot; he wrote: &quot;Compare England with Germany: the English are Germans, and even in the latest times the Germans have led the way for the English in the greatest things.&quot;

Herder, who hated absolutism and Prussian nationalism, but who was imbued with the spirit of the whole German &quot;Volk&quot;, yet as a historical theorist turned away from the ideas of the eighteenth century. Seeking to reconcile his thought with this earlier age, Herder sought to harmonize his conception of sentiment with reasoning, whereby all knowledge is implicit in the soul; the most elementary stage is the sensuous and intuitive perception which by development can become self-conscious and rational. To Herder, this development is the harmonizing of primitive and derivative truth, of experience and intelligence, feeling and reasoning.

Herder is the first in a long line of Germans preoccupied with this harmony. This search is itself the key to the understanding of many German theories of the time; however Herder understood and feared the extremes to which his folk-theory could tend, and so issued specific warnings. He argued that Jews in Germany should enjoy the full rights and obligations of Germans, and that the non-Jews of the world owed a debt to Jews for centuries of abuse, and that this debt could be discharged only by actively assisting those Jews who wished to do so to regain political sovereignty in their ancient homeland of Israel. Herder refused to adhere to a rigid racial theory, writing that &quot;notwithstanding the varieties of the human form, there is but one and the same species of man throughout the whole earth&quot;.

He also announced that &quot;national glory is a deceiving seducer. When it reaches a certain height, it clasps the head with an iron band. The enclosed sees nothing in the mist but his own picture; he is susceptible to no foreign impressions.&quot;

The passage of time was to demonstrate that while many Germans were to find influence in Herder&#x27;s convictions and influence, fewer were to note his qualifying stipulations.

Herder had emphasised that his conception of the nation encouraged democracy and the free self-expression of a people&#x27;s identity. He proclaimed support for the French Revolution, a position which did not endear him to royalty. He also differed with Kant&#x27;s philosophy for not placing reasoning within the context of language. Herder did not think that reason itself could be criticized, as it did not exist except as the process of reasoning. This process was dependent on language. He also turned away from the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement to go back to the poems of Shakespeare and Homer.

To promote his concept of the &quot;Volk&quot;, he published letters and collected folk songs. These latter were published in 1773 as &quot;Voices of the Peoples in Their Songs&quot; (&quot;Stimmen der Völker in ihren Liedern&quot;). The poets Achim von Arnim and Clemens von Brentano later used &quot;Stimmen der Völker&quot; as samples for &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Magic Horn&quot; (&quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;).

Herder also fostered the ideal of a person&#x27;s individuality. Although he had from an early period championed the individuality of cultures – for example, in his &quot;This Too a Philosophy of History for the Formation of Humanity&quot; (1774), he also championed the individuality of &quot;persons&quot; within a culture; for example, in his &quot;On Thomas Abbt&#x27;s Writings&quot; (1768) and &quot;On the Cognition and Sensation of the Human Soul&quot; (1778).

In &quot;On Thomas Abbt&#x27;s Writings&quot;, Herder stated that &quot;a human soul is an
individual in the realm of minds: it senses in accordance with an individual formation, and thinks in accordance with the strength of its mental organs. ... My long allegory has succeeded if it achieves the representation of the mind of a human being as an individual phenomenon, as a rarity which deserves to occupy our eyes.&quot;

===Evolution===

Herder has been described as a proto-evolutionary thinker by some science historians, although this has been disputed by others. Concerning the history of life on earth, Herder proposed naturalistic and metaphysical (religious) ideas that are difficult to distinguish and interpret. He was known for proposing a great chain of being.

In his book &quot;From the Greeks to Darwin&quot;, Henry Fairfield Osborn wrote that &quot;in a general way he upholds the doctrine of the transformation of the lower and higher forms of life, of a continuous transformation from lower to higher types, and of the law of Perfectibility.&quot; However, biographer Wulf Köpke disagreed, noting that &quot;biological evolution from animals to the human species was outside of his thinking, which was still influenced by the idea of divine creation.&quot;

<doc id="294038" wikidata="Q1851815" url="?curid=294038" title="1999 European Parliament election">
<text>The 1999 European Parliament election was a European election for all 626 members of the European Parliament held across the 15 European Union member states on 10, 11 and 13 June 1999. The voter turn-out was generally low, except in Belgium and Luxembourg, where voting is compulsory and where national elections were held that same day. This was the first election where Austria, Finland and Sweden voted alongside the other member states, having joined in 1995 and voted separately. The next election was held in 2004.

==Final results==

== Results by country ==
The national results as at 13 June 1999 are as follows:
*

==Results by group==
===Communists/Far Left===
The EUL/NGL group picked up one seat in the election and seven in the subsequent regrouping, raising its total from 34 to 42.

===Social Democrats===
The PES group did badly, losing 34 of its seats in the election and slipping to the second-biggest group.

===Liberals/Liberal Democrats===
The ELDR group did moderately well, picking up one seat in the election and seven in the regrouping, giving a total of 50 seats and retaining its place as the third biggest group. The European Radical Alliance (ERA) were not so fortunate and slipped badly, losing eight of its 21 members in the election.

===Conservatives/Christian Democrats===
The EPP group did well, picking up 23 seats in the election and nine in the regrouping, giving a total of 233 seats and overtaking the left to become the biggest group. To placate the increasingly eurosceptic British Conservatives, the group was renamed &quot;EPP-ED&quot; for the new Parliament, partly resurrecting the name of the former European Democrat group which was merged with the EPP in 1992.

===National Conservatives===
The Union for Europe (UFE) group slipped during the election and lost 17 seats. The group split during the regrouping, with Ireland&#x27;s Fianna Fáil and Portugal&#x27;s CDS/PP forming a new group called &quot;Union for Europe of the Nations&quot;. UEN started the Fifth Parliament with 31 MEPs.

===Far-Right Nationalists===
No explicitly far-right group &quot;per se&quot; was in existence immediately before or after the election. All far-right MEPs that were elected sat as Independents (see below).

===Greens/Regionalists===
The Green Group solidified its position, picking up 11 seats in the election to give it 38 MEPs. The European Free Alliance members of the ERA joined with the Green Group to create the Greens/EFA group, which started the Fifth Parliament with 48 MEPs.

===Eurosceptics===
The I-EN group trod water, gaining six members in the election but losing five in the regrouping, leaving it with 16 members. The group was renamed &quot;Europe of Democracies and Diversities&quot; (EDD) for the new Parliament.

===Independents===
The Non-Inscrits did badly, losing 20 MEPs to the election. Disparate members (two from Belgium, five from France and eleven from Italy) tried to gain Group privilege by creating a group called the &quot;Technical Group of Independent Members&quot; (full title &quot;Group for the technical co-ordination of groups and the defence of independent members&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;TGI&quot; or &quot;TDI&quot;). The attempt initially succeeded, with the group allowed to start the Fifth Parliament until the legal position could be checked. In September, the Constitutional Affairs Committee ruled that they lacked a coherent position (&quot;political affinity&quot;, the basis for forming a group) and were disbanded - the only group ever to be forcibly dissolved.

<text>The Princess of Asturias Awards (, ), formerly the Prince of Asturias Awards from 1981 to 2014 (), are a series of annual prizes awarded in Spain by the Princess of Asturias Foundation (previously the Prince of Asturias Foundation) to individuals, entities or organizations from around the world who make notable achievements in the sciences, humanities, and public affairs.

The awards are presented every October in a solemn ceremony at in Oviedo, the capital of the Principality of Asturias, and are presented by the Princess of Asturias. Each recipient present at the ceremony receives a diploma, a sculpture expressly created for the awards by Spanish sculptor Joan Miró and a pin with the emblem of the Foundation. There is also a monetary prize of €50,000 for each category; this amount is shared if the category has more than one recipient.

They were declared of &quot;exceptional contribution to the cultural heritage of Humanity&quot; by UNESCO in 2004.

==Background==
The Prince of Asturias Awards were established on 24 September 1980, with the creation of the Prince of Asturias Foundation, in a ceremony presided by Felipe, Prince of Asturias, then heir to the throne of Spain, &quot;to consolidate links between the Principality and the Prince of Asturias, and to contribute to, encourage and promote scientific, cultural and humanistic values that form part of mankind&#x27;s universal heritage&quot;. 

Following the accession of the Prince as King of Spain on 19 June 2014, it was announced that from 2015, the foundation and the awards are to be renamed the Princess of Asturias Awards to reflect the new heiress presumptive to the Spanish throne, Leonor, Princess of Asturias. King Felipe continued to preside over the awards ceremony until the Princess of Asturias turned 18 (the age of majority for Spanish royal purposes) on 31 October 2023. Princess Leonor first attended the ceremony, handed out awards to winners and delivered her first speech ever as heiress to the crown during the 39th Princess of Asturias Awards Ceremony on 18 October 2019. Her father, then Prince Felipe, did the same during the 1st Prince of Asturias Awards Ceremony on 31 October 1981.

If a laureate does not attend to the ceremony to collect their award, they receive neither the sculpture nor the monetary prize, even if the absence is because of force majeure. Only a few laureates have not attended; among them are Bob Dylan, who refused to go to Oviedo in 2007 but asked for the sculpture unsuccessfully, writer Philip Roth in 2012 for medical reasons, and Pau and Marc Gasol in 2015, who were not allowed to attend by their NBA teams.

<doc id="294055" wikidata="Q216813" url="?curid=294055" title="Ryszard Kapuściński">
<text>Ryszard Kapuściński (; 4 March 1932 – 23 January 2007) was a Polish journalist, photographer, poet and author. He received many awards and was considered a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Kapuściński&#x27;s personal journals in book form attracted both controversy and admiration for blurring the conventions of reportage with the allegory and magical realism of literature. He was the Communist-era Polish Press Agency&#x27;s only correspondent in Africa during decolonization, and also worked in South America and Asia. Between 1956 and 1981 he reported on 27 revolutions and coups, until he was fired because of his support for the pro-democracy Solidarity movement in his native country. He was celebrated by other practitioners of the genre. The acclaimed Italian reportage-writer Tiziano Terzani, Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez, and Chilean writer Luis Sepúlveda accorded him the title &quot;Maestro&quot;.

Notable works include &quot;Jeszcze dzień życia&quot; (1976; &quot;Another Day of Life&quot;), about Angola; &quot;Cesarz&quot; (1978; &quot;The Emperor&quot;, 1983), about the downfall of Ethiopian ruler Haile Selassie, also considered to be a satire of Communist Poland; &quot;Wojna futbolowa&quot; (1978; &quot;The Soccer War&quot;, 1991), an account of the 1969 conflict between Honduras and El Salvador, and other stories from the life of the reporter in Africa and Latin America; &quot;Szachinszach&quot; (1982; &quot;Shah of Shahs&quot;, 2006) about the downfall of the last Shah of Iran; &quot;Imperium&quot; (1993), an account of his travels through the collapsing Soviet Union; &quot;Heban&quot; (1998), later published in English as &quot;The Shadow of the Sun&quot; (2001), the story of his years in Africa; and &quot;Podróże z Herodotem&quot; (2004; &quot;Travels with Herodotus&quot;), in which he ponders over relevance of &quot;The Histories&quot; by Herodotus to a modern reporter&#x27;s job.

==Biography==

Ryszard Kapuściński was born in Pinsk (now in Belarus), Polesie Voivodeship, in the Kresy Wschodnie or eastern borderlands of the Second Polish Republic in 1932, the son of Maria Bobka (b. 1910) and Józef Kapuściński (b. 1903), primary school teachers. His sister Barbara was born the following year. They were born into poverty: he would later say that he felt at home in Africa as &quot;food was scarce there too and everyone was also barefoot.&quot; In September 1938 Ryszard started attending Primary School No 5 in Pinsk. He spent the summer of 1939 together with his mother and sister in Pawłów, a small village near Rejowiec in Lublin Voivodeship. When the Second World War began in September 1939 they came back to Pinsk after the city was captured by the Red Army and Ryszard returned to school there. In 1940 Maria, afraid of deportation to the East, together with Ryszard and Barbara left Pinsk and moved to Sieraków, near Warsaw. There they met Józef. Later the family moved near Otwock. Ryszard continued education in primary school in Otwock (1944–45). He described his early life in the book &quot;Imperium&quot;.

In 1945 the family settled in Warsaw where Ryszard began education in Stanisław Staszic Gymnasium. He became an amateur boxer (bantamweight) and football player. In 1948, Kapuściński joined the official Communist youth organisationthe ZMPand served lower rank posts. Kapuściński was the hero of the article published in the weekly periodical &quot;Odrodzenie&quot; reporting on a poetry conference organised at his school, in which the teenager&#x27;s poems were compared with works of Mayakovsky and Wierzyński.

In June 1950 he graduated from Gymnasium and started working for the &quot;Sztandar Młodych&quot; (The Banner of Youth), a nationwide newspaper founded in 1950 as the organ of the ZMP. In October 1950 he began his studies at Warsaw University (Department of Polish Studies) and in 1951 he moved to the department of history after he suspended working for &quot;Sztandar Młodych&quot; till 1955. He participated in the Youth Festival in East Berlin staged in August 1951 in East Germany. This was his first foreign trip. From 1952 and till his death Ryszard Kapuściński was married to doctor Alicja Mielczarek (1933–2022). Their daughter Zofia was born in 1953. During the period from 1953 to 1981the year of the imposition of the martial law in PolandKapuściński was a member of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (the PZPR). His attitude to the PZPR changed early on, &quot;the decisive moment having come in the year 1956&quot; (presumably a reference to the events of Poznań June and the process of de-Stalinisation brought about by the Thaw of Gomułka, and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956).

In June 1955 he graduated from Warsaw University. After publishing, in September 1955, a critical article about the construction of Nowa Huta, a Kraków conurbation built on a site chosen as the &quot;first socialist municipality in Poland&quot;, which brought to light the inhuman working and living conditions of the labourers involved in the venture—a story which occasioned consternation before eventually winning favour with the Communist authorities unsure at first how to react to a fault-finding depiction of their pet project by one of their own—Kapuściński was awarded the Golden Cross of Merit at the age of 23.

In August 1956 he reported from Kyiv and in September he was sent to India, his first travel outside Europe. He returned via Afghanistan (where he was detained at the airport in Kabul) and Moscow. In August 1957 he went for half a year to China (via Tokyo and Hong Kong). He came back to Poland by the Trans-Siberian Railway. Beginning with that journey to India undertaken at the age of 24, he travelled across the developing world reporting on wars, coups and revolutions in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. He started learning English in India by reading, with the help of a dictionary, a copy of Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. He wrote about his first travels to Asia in the book &quot;Travels with Herodotus&quot;.

In 1958 he left &quot;Sztandar Młodych&quot; and started working for the Polish Press Agency. Shortly afterwards he also joined the weekly &quot;Polityka&quot; (where he worked till 1962). The result of his work for the weekly was the book &quot;Busz po polsku&quot; (The Polish Bush) published in 1962, a collection of his articles from the &quot;Polish wilderness&quot; that he went into to relate &quot;the perspectives of forgotten, invisible, marginal people and so to record a living history of those seldom deemed worthy to enter the annals of official history&quot; (in the words of Diana Kuprel, the literary scholar and translator of Kapuściński&#x27;s works). He was aggrieved at the indifference of the reading public towards the majority of his early books.

In the late 1950s he went for the first time to Africa (Ghana, Republic of Dahomey and Niger). After honing his skills on domestic stories he was later &quot;&#x27;responsible&#x27; for fifty countries&quot; for the Polish Press Agency in Africa. (Although a correspondent of an official state press agency, he never in his life asked a single question at any press conference that he attended). When he finally returned to Poland, he had lived through twenty-seven revolutions and coups, been jailed 40 times and survived four death sentences. In the English-speaking world, Kapuściński is best known for his reporting from Africa in the 1960s and 1970s, when he witnessed first-hand the end of the European colonial empires on that continent.

In 1961 he reported from the Republic of the Congo. He described his escape to Bujumbura and subsequent arrest in the book &quot;The Soccer War&quot;. In the years 1962–65 he lived initially in Dar es Salaam and later in Nairobi from where he travelled to other countries in Africa. He came back to Poland for only a few weeks in 1965 but returned to Africa to live in Lagos and continue reporting. In April 1965 he travelled to Senegal and Mauritania which he later described in the book &quot;The Shadow of the Sun&quot;. At the end of 1966 he came back to Poland. In April 1967 he went to Central Asia and Caucasus. In November the same year he started working as a foreign correspondent in South America, based in Santiago. Later he moved to Mexico (1969–72). In 1969 he witnessed war in Honduras which he described in the book &quot;The Soccer War&quot;. In 1969 he edited and translated from the Spanish &quot;El diario del Che en Bolivia&quot;, the final literary bequest of Che Guevara. Kapuściński analyzed the situation in Guatemala after a German diplomat Karl von Spreti was kidnapped. He published his reportage in 1970 entitled &quot;Dlaczego zginął Karl von Spreti&quot; (Why Karl von Spreti Died). He returned to Poland in 1972 and later worked for magazines &quot;Kontynenty&quot; and &quot;Kultura&quot;. In September 1975 he went to Angola after which he published the book &quot;Another Day of Life&quot;. In 1975 and 1977 he went to Ethiopia. &quot;The Emperor&quot; was written after his travels there. In 1979 he visited his birthplace Pinsk for the first time since 1940. In 1979 he went to Iran to witness the Iranian Revolution. His book &quot;Shah of Shahs&quot; deals with this subject and the fall of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran.
In 1980 he witnessed the strikes that took place in Gdańsk, Poland. In 1988 two episodes of Arena were dedicated to him and his work. He travelled in European and Asian parts of the Soviet Union (1989–1992) and witnessed the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After this experience he wrote &quot;Imperium&quot;. He was awarded German Academic Exchange Service scholarship in Berlin in 1994. In 1999 Kapuściński talked about his life in VPRO in a series of autobiographical interviews with prominent people from the worlds of science, culture and politics.

In a 2006 interview with Reuters, Kapuściński said that he wrote for &quot;people everywhere still young enough to be curious about the world.&quot; He was fluent in Polish, English, Russian, Spanish, French and Portuguese. He was visiting professor in Bangalore (1970s), Bonn, Cape Town, Caracas (1979), Columbia University (1983), Harvard University, Irkutsk, London, Madrid, Mexico (1979), San Sebastian, Temple University (1988) and Vancouver.

Kapuściński died on 23 January 2007, of a heart attack suffered in a Warsaw hospital where he was being treated for unrelated ailments.

==Literary works==

From the early 1960s onwards, Kapuściński published books of increasing literary craftsmanship characterized by sophisticated narrative technique, psychological portraits of characters, a wealth of stylization and metaphor and unusual imagery that serves as means of interpreting the perceived world. Kapuściński&#x27;s best-known book, &quot;The Emperor&quot;, concerns itself with the decline of Haile Selassie&#x27;s anachronistic régime in Ethiopia. The book&#x27;s story had a special meaning that was not lost on the people of Poland, especially as dissent against the PZPR was taking root. &quot;The Emperor&quot; was also the book that established Kapuściński&#x27;s reputation in the West. When it appeared in English translation in 1983 it received an immediate critical success. In 1987 the book was adapted by Michael Hastings and Jonathan Miller into a theatre play, produced by the Royal Court Theatre, London.

Kapuściński was fascinated by the humanity he found in different worlds and people, as well as the books of these worlds and people: he approached foreign countries first through literature, spending months reading before each trip. He was skilled in listening to the diverse people he met, but he was also capable of &quot;reading&quot; the hidden sense of the scenes he encountered: the way the Europeans moved out of Angola, a discussion regarding alimony in the Tanganyikan parliament, the reconstruction of frescoes in the new Russiahe turned each of these vignettes into a metaphor of historical transformation.

This tendency to process private experiences into a greater social synthesis made Kapuściński an eminent thinker, and the volumes of the ongoing &quot;Lapidarium&quot; series are a record of the shaping of a reporter&#x27;s observations into philosophical reflections on the world, its people and their suffering. He had great compassion for the poor, the victimised, and the debased.

Kapuściński himself called his work &quot;literary reportage&quot;, and &quot;reportage d&#x27;auteur&quot;. In the English-speaking world, his genre is sometimes characterised as &quot;magic journalism&quot; (in counterpoint to magic realism), a term coined by Adam Hochschild in 1994. Kapuściński often introduced himself with the line &quot;I am a poor reporter who unfortunately lacks the imagination of a writer&quot;.

Italian journalist Tiziano Terzani and Ryszard Kapuściński shared a similar vision of journalism. Jaime Abello Banfi, the friend and associate of Gabriel García Márquez, reports that García Márquez and Kapuściński, unbeknownst to each other, shared the opinion that the way to good journalism led through poetry (because it inculcates both the conciseness of expression and its aptness).

Kapuściński considered the ancient Greek historian Herodotus a great reporter and his master. He wrote a book &quot;Travels with Herodotus&quot; where he shows that the &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus are timeless and the masterpiece of reportage. He also considered Curzio Malaparte, Melchior Wańkowicz, Ksawery Pruszyński and Franciszek Gil (1917–1960) to have been his literary models and stylistic precursors. On some level, Pruszyński and Wańkowicz shared a very similar approach to facts with Kapuściński, believing that the general picture of the story can be glued from bits and pieces to reveal a truth as a wholly independent construct. Students of Kapuściński&#x27;s work observed correspondences between his work and that of J. M. Coetzee in that both writers were supposedly beholden to the theory of &quot;the responsibility of witness&quot;.

One reviewer saw in Kapuściński&#x27;s mixing of subtle psychological reflection with vivid description an invitation to a comparison with Joseph Conrad; Binyavanga Wainaina and Aleksandar Hemon made the same comparison, if for other, less laudatory reasons. Kapuściński confirmed to Bill Deedes the fact that Conrad was one of his literary inspirations. Neal Ascherson likened him to Egon Erwin Kisch (1885–1948) considered the father of literary reportage. Kapuściński himself cites Kisch with approval as the &quot;classic of reportage&quot; who dealt a death blow to traditional forms of reporting by putting the person of the reporter at centre stage. Certainly, neither Kisch nor Kapuściński believed in what might be called &quot;journalistic objectivity&quot;: whereas Kisch thought it necessary for a (Communist) reporter to &quot;engage politically&quot; with his subject, Kapuściński would put objectivity as a concept out of court altogether, stating explicitly, &quot;There is no such thing as objectivity. Objectivity is the question of the conscience of the one who writes. And he himself should answer the question is this what he writes close to the truth or not&quot;.

Kapuściński&#x27;s views on his craft were published in 2000 in the book in Italian &quot;Il cinico non è adatto a questo mestiere: conversazioni sul buon giornalismo&quot; (A Cynic wouldn&#x27;t Suit This Profession: Conversations about Good Journalism), the book in Spanish from 2003 (distributed for free) &quot;Los cinco sentidos del periodista (estar, ver, oír, compartir, pensar)&quot; (The Journalist&#x27;s Five Senses: Witnessing, Seeing, Listening, Sharing and Thinking) and in his Polish book &quot;Autoportret reportera&quot; (A Reporter&#x27;s Self Portrait) published the same year. In 1987 Marek Miller talked with Kapuściński on the art of reportage and his life. These conversations were published in Poland in 2012 in the book &quot;Pisanie&quot; (Writing) but broadcast in Canada on &quot;Kalejdoskop Polski&quot; TV as early as 1988. He was vocal denouncing manipulations and ignorance of big media.

===Photographer===
Kapuściński debuted as a photographer in the year 2000 with the publication of the album entitled &quot;Z Afryki&quot; (&quot;Out of Africa&quot;), a photographic harvest of his journeys in that continent. &quot;Every snapshot is a recollection, a remembrance,&quot; he writes in the introduction, &quot;and nothing can sensitise us more to the fragility of time, to its impermanent and fleeting naturethan photography.&quot; A sequel, entitled &quot;Ze świata&quot; (&quot;From the World&quot;, published in November 2008 with the introduction of John Updike), comprising a cross-section of Kapuściński&#x27;s photographs from all parts of the world, contains some truly outstanding shots.

===Posthumous and non-reportage works===
In &quot;Ten Inny&quot; (&quot;The Other&quot;), a collection of lectures delivered in Vienna, Graz and Kraków, published shortly before his death, Kapuściński laments a state of affairs perpetuated by the myths which inculcate the notion of the Other as sub-human or non-human. He saw encountering the Other as the main challenge for the twenty-first century. The posthumously published &quot;Ho dato voce ai poveri: dialogo con i giovani&quot; (&quot;I Gave a Voice to the Poor: Conversations with the Youth&quot;; Trent, Il Margine, 2007; subsequently published in Poland as &quot;Dałem głos ubogim. Rozmowy z młodzieżą&quot;; Kraków, Znak, 2008) is a record of Kapuściński&#x27;s interactions with the students of the University of Bolzano in Italy in October 2006; while &quot;Rwący nurt historii. Zapiski o XX i XXI wieku&quot; (&quot;In the Whirlpools of History: Jottings on the 20th and the 21st Centuries&quot;; Kraków, Znak, 2007) is a compilation of interviews and lectures, reflecting Kapuściński&#x27;s training as a historian and dealing with contemporary issues and their historical and cross-cultural parallels (including such issues as globalisation, Islam, the birth of the Third World, and the dawn of the Pacific civilisation).

Kapuściński&#x27;s pronouncements on current affairs were noteworthy: he thought that the causes of the 9/11 tragedy, for example, were too complex to lend themselves to an exhaustively thorough analysis at present, although he offered an extensive and sophisticated exposition of some of the key elements of the puzzle in the &quot;Clash of Civilisations&quot;. He was critical on the &quot;Clash of Civilisations&quot; theory which he saw as an American vision of the world. He told a BBC interviewer right after the attacks: &quot;I greatly fear that we will waste this moment. That instead of meaningful dialogue, it will just be gates and metal detectors&quot;.

In an interview granted in 2002 to the then editor-in-chief of the monthly &quot;Letras Libres&quot;, Ricardo Cayuela Gally, Kapuściński opined that the war on terror, owing to the asymmetrical character of the combatants engaged in it, could only be wonand indeed easily, within a monththrough a (re)introduction of &quot;Stalinism&quot;, a method undesirable for the sole reason that it would leave the world under the permanent &quot;hegemony&quot; of the United States, a circumstance that would spell the end of &quot;the free society&quot;.

In Poland, since 1986 Kapuściński was also known as a poet: he privately confided in his Swedish translator, Anders Bodegård, that he considered this to be his primary identity. In November 2007 the Canadian publishing house Biblioasis published Kapuściński&#x27;s selected poems in English, &quot;I Wrote Stone&quot;, the first English translation of his poetry. Los Angeles Times wrote: &quot;Big events (...) may have been treated lyrically in his prose, but (...) these poems capture the moments between crises, impressions that carry a book-length argument in a few lines&quot;. Collected poems from his books were published in Poland and Canada in 2012 in both Polish and English in the book &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, translated by Diana Kuprel and Marek Kusiba.

Although he was not the sole model for the role, Kapuściński was given a portrayal as the main character in Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s 1978 film &quot;Without Anesthesia&quot;. Aleksandar Hemon, the Bosnian-American novelist (who had previously impugned Robert D. Kaplan&#x27;s stereotyping of &quot;the Balkan mind&quot;), in a critique of Kapuściński&#x27;s Africa writings published in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, accused Kapuściński&#x27;s readers of turning a blind eye to &quot;the underlying proto-racist essentialism&quot; that informs his vision of and his approach to the cultures of the continent: &quot;[Kapuściński] fumes against the racism absurdly based on skin colour, and would probably be shocked if told that his obsessive listing of essential differences [between &quot;the African mind&quot; and &quot;the European mind&quot;] is essentially racist&quot;.

==Reception==
Kapuściński had a global reputation, and is one of the Polish writers translated into the highest number of foreign languages.

In an obituary published in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, Kapuściński was described by German journalist Claus Christian Malzahn as &quot;one of the most credible journalists the world has ever seen&quot;. Daniel Alarcón, a Peruvian-American novelist, cited Kapuściński as a formative influence together with Dostoyevsky. The American journalist and reportage-writer Richard Bernstein, saw value in the &quot;penetrating intelligence&quot; of Kapuściński&#x27;s vision and in his &quot;crystallised descriptive&quot; style of writing. The British journalist Bill Deedes, who had witnessed the Rwandan genocide first-hand, said of Kapuściński that what he &quot;writes about Africa is authoritative as well as captivating. His account of how the Hutus and the Tutsis were drawn into that dark night of genocide in Rwanda is the most enlightening I have read anywhere&quot; and that he had &quot;transformed journalism into literature in his writings about Africa&quot;. Professor Philip Melling of Swansea University has concurred with this opinion, citing Kapuściński as an authority on the Rwandan conflict.

Salman Rushdie wrote about him: &quot;One Kapuściński is worth more than a thousand whimpering and fantasizing scribblers. His exceptional combination of journalism and art allows us to feel so close to what Kapuściński calls the inexpressible true image of war&quot;.

Frequently mentioned as a favorite to win the Nobel Prize in literature, he never did. Kapuściński&#x27;s dying before he could be awarded the Prize was bemoaned in the Swedish press as late as October 2010. Since his death he has been offered many epitaphs in the press, such as, &quot;The master of modern journalism&quot;, &quot;Translator of the World&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Reporter in the World&quot;, &quot;Herodotus of our times&quot;, &quot;Third World chronicler&quot;.

Over the years, particularly since 1983 when &quot;The Emperor&quot; was named Book of the Year by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London, Kapuściński was the recipient of many international literary prizes that brought recognition to his creative &quot;oeuvre&quot;: these included, for example, the biennial Hanseatic Goethe Prize awarded by the Hamburg-based foundation, the Alfred Toepfer Stiftung, which he received in 1999; or the Italian Elsa Morante Prize (Premio Elsa Morante, Sezione Culture D&#x27;Europa) in 2005, for his &quot;Travels with Herodotus&quot; (the new category of the Premio Elsa Morante, called &quot;Cultures of Europe&quot;, in effect a separate prize awarded by the same jury, having apparently been created specially for him).

In 2001 Kapuściński received the literary Prix Tropiques of the French Development Agency for his book &quot;The Shadow of the Sun&quot;, published in France under the title &quot;Ébène: Aventures africaines&quot;, which had a year earlier been named the best book of the year by the French literary monthly, &quot;Lire&quot;; the book also won the Italian literary award, Feudo Di Maida Prize (in full, Premio Letterario Internazionale Feudo Di Maida), for the year 2000. That same year (2000) Kapuściński was honoured with the prestigious Premio Internazionale Viareggio-Versilia, as well as having received the Creola Prize (Premio Creola) in Bologna (awarded for travel books and facilitation of intercultural encounters), and the &quot;Premio Letterario &#x27;Della Resistenza&#x27; of the Piedmontese city of Omegna (Premio Omegna).

In 2003 Kapuściński received the Premio Grinzane Cavour per la Lettura in Turin; shared the Prince of Asturias Award (in the category &quot;Communications and Humanities&quot;) with the Peruvian theologian Gustavo Gutiérrez; and was awarded the Kreisky Prize (Bruno-Kreisky-Preis für das politische Buch) for the entirety of his work (&quot;Sonderpreis für das publizistische Gesamtwerk&quot;; the award ceremony having taken place in Vienna in May of the following year). As the doyen of literary reportage, he was the keynote speaker at the inaugural ceremony, held in Berlin in October 2003, for the Lettre Ulysses Awards for the Art of Reportage.

In 2005 the Italian edition of Kapuściński&#x27;s poems (which appeared in print the previous year as &quot;Taccuino d&#x27;appunti&quot; in the translation of Silvano De Fanti) won the state-funded Naples Prize (Premio Napoli). To complete the round-up of Italian prizes, the next year Kapuściński was awarded a special category of the Ilaria Alpi Prize for the entirety of his career (Premio Ilaria Alpi alla carriera), one of the best-known of Italian journalistic awards, named for an Italian investigative reporter murdered in Somalia in 1994 (although the scope of the prize is limited to TV journalism, special categories of prizes for which he would not otherwise qualifyas also for example in the case of the Elsa Morante Prizehave been created for Kapuściński). Kapuściński received honorary doctorates from the University of Silesia (1997), the University of Wrocław (2001), the University of Sofia (2002), the University of Gdańsk (2004), Jagiellonian University (2004). In June 2005 Kapuściński was invested with an honorary doctorate by the private Ramon Llull University of Barcelona, Spain; and in May 2006, just eight months before his death, he received a similar degree from the University of Udine in Italy.

In 2010, Warsaw City Council established the Ryszard Kapuściński Award as a form of distinction and promotion of the most worthwhile reportage books which touch on important contemporary issues, evoke reflection, and deepen our knowledge of the world of other cultures.

===Controversy and biographies===

Since at least 1987 Kapuściński&#x27;s veracity as a reporter has been disputed, and he responded with the explanation that his work had been allegorical. By his own account he chose to avoid dates, names, and orders of events. Since at least 2001, there has been literary debate about to which genre Kapuściński&#x27;s work should be categorized.

A 2001 review by John Ryle concerned the Kapuściński memoir entitled &quot;The Shadow of the Sun&quot; released in the same year. Ryle alleged that questions about the reliability of Kapuściński&#x27;s reportage began with &quot;The Emperor&quot;. Scrutinizing Kapuściński&#x27;s translation of expressions of fealty by Ethiopian courtiers, Ryle said that &quot;native speakers of Amharic say that these honorifics correspond to no known expressions in their language.&quot; Ryle wrote that he visited Ethiopia in the 1990s when the action of &quot;The Shadow of the Sun&quot; was taking place. He said there were inaccuracies in the story, for example, that Mengistu&#x27;s generals did not escape justice and that the &#x27;academics&#x27; among them were few and far in between. Ryle noticed that the initials of Kapuściński&#x27;s informants did not correspond to the names of witnesses in the trial of the Derg in Addis Ababa. He added that Kapuściński&#x27;s description of the capital devoid of bookstores did not correspond to what he has seen on his last visit there, because he found six bookstores there. He also disputed Kapuściński&#x27;s assertion that Haile Selassie did not read books by saying he had a library, was well read, and annotated documents.

Ryle continued:

In answer to such criticisms it has been argued that The Emperor is not meant to be about Ethiopia at all, that it is an allegory of Communist power in Poland, or of autocratic regimes in general. ... Like Kapuściński&#x27;s other books, The Emperor is presented unambiguously as factual reportage and it asserts its claim on the reader&#x27;s attention as such. ... There is a double standard at work in such excuses, a clear eurocentric bias. Consider the hypothetical case of an author publishing a book of scandalous revelations about the last years of the Gierek regime in communist Poland, using dubious information obtained in obscure circumstances from anonymous and untraceable members of the Polish Internal Security Police. It would not be considered a reasonable defence of such a book to say that it did not matter whether it was true or not because it was really intended, not as a book about Poland, but as an allegorical account of events in imperial Ethiopia. ... Such criticisms do not rob Kapuściński&#x27;s writing of its bright allure, its illuminating moments, its often lively sympathy for the people of the countries he writes about, but they warn us not to take it seriously as a guide to reality.

Polish scholars Dr. Beata Nowacka (University of Silesia) and Dr. Zygmunt Ziątek (Polish Academy of Sciences) wrote the first biography of Kapuściński, which was published by Znak in 2008 under the title &quot;Ryszard Kapuściński. Biografia pisarza&quot;. Their monograph was translated in 2010 to Spanish (&quot;Kapuscinski. Una biografía literaria&quot;) and in 2012 to Italian (&quot;Ryszard Kapuściński. Biografia di uno scrittore&quot;). Professor Silvano De Fanti from the University of Udine wrote Kapuściński&#x27;s biography for the &quot;Opere&quot; (2009), published in Italian in the Meridiani series which aims to collect major writers of all times from all countries.

In 2010, a Polish language monograph titled &quot;Kapuściński Non-Fiction&quot; written by Artur Domosławski was published in Warsaw. Kapuściński&#x27;s widow, Alicja Kapuścińska, sought an injunction against Domosławski&#x27;s book, claiming defamation and invasion of privacy. The injunction was rejected by the Polish court on the grounds that she had chosen to give Domosławski access to her husband&#x27;s archive. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; Domosławski said: &quot;Kapuściński was experimenting in journalism. He wasn&#x27;t aware he had crossed the line between journalism and literature. I still think his books are wonderful and precious. But ultimately, they belong to fiction.&quot; Domosławski&#x27;s monograph was translated to English in 2012 by Antonia Lloyd-Jones and first published by Verso Books as &quot;Ryszard Kapuściński. A Life&quot; in 2012.

Neal Ascherson defended Kapuściński in March 2010 by saying: &quot;None of the doubts, as far as I can see, are about the despatches and features he sent to newspapers, or to the Polish Press Agency. They are about his books. The adventures and encounters he describes in his books are on a different level of veracity. Like his friend Gabriel García Márquez, Kapuściński used to talk about &quot;literary reportage&quot;. You&#x27;re meant to believe what you are being told, but not in every literal detail. ... Scrupulous in his journalism, in his books he was capable of inventing to make a truth even truer. He was a great story-teller, but not a liar.&quot; Timothy Garton Ash was more critical. Ash wrote later that month (reprinted in his &quot;Facts Are Subversive&quot;): &quot;with Kapuscinski, we keep crossing from the Kenya of fact to the Tanzania of fiction, and back again, but the transition is nowhere explicitly signalled.&quot;
Reviewing the English translation of Domosławski&#x27;s book for &quot;The Financial Times&quot; in 2012, the then permanent secretary of the Nobel-awarding Swedish Academy, Peter Englund, said: &quot;In any case, the &quot;literary&quot; in &quot;literary reportage&quot; doesn&#x27;t absolve you of your duty to the facts. Neither is it possible, in my mind, to see it as a sliding scale, in which you are able slowly to introduce droplets of fiction into a factual text until, at a certain point, the mixture transforms into pure fiction. No, once an element of fiction is introduced into a text everything immediately turns into fiction – maybe fiction with a strong resemblance to the real world, but still fiction.&quot;

The first biographers, Nowacka and Ziątek, responded to Domosławski&#x27;s allegations with their own new book, &quot;Literatura non-fiction. Czytanie Kapuścińskiego po Domosławskim&quot; (&quot;Non‑fiction literature: Reading Kapuściński after Domosławski&quot;) which was published in Polish by the University of Silesia Press in 2013. They oppose the accusation of creating a myth, and his own legend, as well as confabulations and opportunism, showing a selected and tendentious usage of the author&#x27;s life knowledge, the lack of comprehension of literary reportage, manipulation with texts and quotations, as well as numerous factual and technical mistakes made by Domosławski. In 2013 the publisher of Domosławski&#x27;s book apologized to Alicja Kapuścińska and her daughter. In May 2015 amendments were ordered by a court in Warsaw which also ruled that Domosławski should apologise to Kapuściński&#x27;s widow, however in August 2015 the same court has ruled that the author will not have to apologise to Kapuściński&#x27;s daughter.

<text>In logic, extensionality, or extensional equality, refers to principles that judge objects to be equal if they have the same external properties. It stands in contrast to the concept of intensionality, which is concerned with whether the internal definitions of objects are the same.
==In mathematics==
The extensional definition of function equality, discussed above, is commonly used in mathematics.
A similar extensional definition is usually employed for relations: two relations are said to be equal if they have the same extensions.

In set theory, the axiom of extensionality states that two sets are equal if and only if they contain the same elements. In mathematics formalized in set theory, it is common to identify relations—and, most importantly, functions—with their extension as stated above, so that it is impossible for two relations or functions with the same extension to be distinguished.

Other mathematical objects are also constructed in such a way that the intuitive notion of &quot;equality&quot; agrees with set-level extensional equality; thus, equal ordered pairs have equal elements, and elements of a set which are related by an equivalence relation belong to the same equivalence class.

Type-theoretical foundations of mathematics are generally &quot;not&quot; extensional in this sense, and setoids are commonly used to maintain a difference between intensional equality and a more general equivalence relation (which generally has poor constructibility or decidability properties).

==Extensionality principles==
There are various extensionality principles in mathematics. 
* Propositional extensionality of predicates formula_1: if formula_2 then formula_3
* Functional extensionality of functions formula_4: if formula_5 then formula_6
* Univalence: if formula_7 then formula_8 . 
Depending on the chosen foundation, some extensionality principles may imply another. For example it is well known that in univalent foundations, the univalence axiom implies both propositional and functional extensionality. Extensionality principles are usually assumed as axioms, especially in type theories where computational content must be preserved. However, in set theory and other extensional foundations, functional extensionality can be proven to hold by default.

==Example==

Consider the two functions &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; mapping from and to natural numbers, defined as follows:
* To find &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), first add 5 to &quot;n&quot;, then multiply by 2.
* To find &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), first multiply &quot;n&quot; by 2, then add 10. 

These functions are extensionally equal; given the same input, both functions always produce the same value. But the definitions of the functions are not equal, and in that intensional sense the functions are not the same. 

Similarly, in natural language there are many predicates (relations) that are intensionally different but are extensionally identical. For example, suppose that a village has just one person named Joe, who is also the oldest person in the village. Then, the two predicates &quot;being called Joe&quot;, and &quot;being the oldest person&quot; are intensionally distinct, but extensionally equal for the (current) population of this village.

<doc id="294057" wikidata="Q34002" url="?curid=294057" title="Sundanese language">
<text>Sundanese ( ; , Sundanese script: , Pegon script: , ) is a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken in Java, primarily by the Sundanese. It has approximately 32 million native speakers in the western third of Java; they represent about 15% of Indonesia&#x27;s total population.

==Classification==
According to American linguist Robert Blust, Sundanese is closely related to the Malayic languages, as well as to language groups spoken in Borneo such as the Land Dayak languages or the Kayan–Murik languages, based on high lexical similarities between these languages.

== History and distribution ==
Sundanese is mainly spoken on the west side of the island of Java, in an area known as Tatar Sunda (Pasundan). However, Sundanese is also spoken in the western part of Central Java, especially in Brebes and Cilacap Regency, because these areas were previously under the control of the Galuh Kingdom. Many place names in Cilacap are still Sundanese names such as Dayeuhluhur, Cimanggu, Cipari, even as far as Banyumas, such as Cilongok, Cingebul, Gumelar, and others.

Until 1600 AD, Sundanese was the state language in the kingdoms of Salakanagara, Tarumanagara, Sunda, Galuh, Pajajaran, and Sumedang Larang. During this period, Sundanese was heavily influenced by the Sanskrit language as seen in the &quot;Batu Tapak Kaki Kiri Nyoreang&quot; inscription at the time of King Purnawarman, using the Pallava script. Sundanese at that time was used in the fields of state, art, and daily life, many religious books were written in Sundanese and used Old Sundanese script such as the &quot;Sanghyang Siksa Kandang Karesian&quot; Manuscript, &quot;Carita Parahyangan&quot;, &quot;Amanat Galunggung&quot;, and &quot;Guru Talapakan&quot;.

In addition, according to some Sundanese language experts until around the 6th century, the area of speech reached around the Dieng Plateau in Central Java, based on the name &quot;Dieng&quot; which is considered the name Sundanese (from the origin of the word &quot;dihyang&quot; which is an Old Sundanese word). Along with transmigration and immigration carried out by the Sundanese ethnics, speakers of this language have spread beyond the island of Java. For example, in Lampung, South Sumatra, Bengkulu, Riau, West Kalimantan, Southeast Sulawesi, and even outside the country of Indonesia, such as Taiwan, Japan, Australia, and other countries, a significant number of ethnic Sundanese live in areas outside the Pasundan.

==Dialects==
Sundanese has several dialects, conventionally described according to the locations of the people:

*Western dialect, spoken in the provinces of Banten, the western part of Bogor Regency (especially in Greater Jasinga area), and some parts of Lampung.
*Northern dialect, spoken in Bogor Regency, and northwestern coastal areas of West Java.

The Priangan dialect, which covers the largest area where Sundanese people lives (&quot;Parahyangan&quot; in Sundanese), is the most widely spoken type of Sundanese language, taught in elementary till senior-high schools (equivalent to twelfth-year school grade) in West Java and Banten Province.

==Writing==

The language has been written in different writing systems throughout history. The earliest attested documents of the Sundanese language were written in the Old Sundanese script (). After the arrival of Islam, the Pegon script is also used, usually for religious purposes. The Latin script then began to be used after the arrival of Europeans. In modern times, most of Sundanese literature is written in Latin. Meanwhile, the regional governments of West Java and Banten have been actively promoting the use of Standard Sundanese script () in public places and on road signs. Although Pegon script is now mostly used in pesantrens (Islamic boarding schools) and Sundanese Islamic literature, it can still occasionally be seen in public places and on road signs in certain areas, such as Lembang and Tasikmalaya.

==Phonology==
Sundanese orthography is highly phonemic (see also Sundanese script).

=== Vowels ===
There are seven vowels: a , é , i , o , u , e , and eu .

=== Consonants ===
According to Müller-Gotama (2001) there are 18 consonants in the Sundanese phonology: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ; however, influences from foreign languages have introduced several additional consonants such as , , (as in &quot;fonem&quot;, &quot;qur&#x27;an&quot;, &quot;xerox&quot;, &quot;zakat&quot;). The consonantal phonemes are transcribed with the letters p, b, t, d, k, g, c , j , h, ng (), ny , m, n, s , w, l, r , and y .
Other consonants that originally appear in Indonesian loanwords are mostly transferred into native consonants: f/v → p, sy → s, z → j, and kh → h.

Epenthetic semivowels and are inserted after a high vowel immediately followed by another vowel, as in the words:
* kuéh – 
* muih – 
* béar – 
* miang – 
* eweuh – 

==Register==
Sundanese has an elaborate system of register distinguishing levels of formality. At the beginning of speech level development, it was known 6 levels of Sundanese language: &quot;basa kasar&quot; (rough), &quot;sedeng&quot; (medium), &quot;lemes&quot; (polite), &quot;lemes pisan&quot; (very polite), &quot;kasar pisan&quot; (very rough), and &quot;basa panengah&quot; (intermediate). But since the 1988 Congress of Sundanese Language in Bogor, the speech level has been narrowed to only two parts: &quot;basa hormat&quot; (respectful) and &quot;basa loma&quot; (fair). Besides that, the term was changed to &quot;tatakrama basa&quot; (), although the substance remained the same. The &quot;hormat&quot; variant is a subtle language to respect, while the loma variant is fair, neutral and familiar use. This variety of &quot;loma&quot; language is then used as a kind of &quot;standard&quot; variety of written languages in Sundanese society. Sundanese magazines, newspapers, literary books and theses, mostly using the &quot;loma&quot; variant.

Apart from the two previous levels, there is actually one more lowest level, namely &quot;cohag&quot; (rough). This level is only used when angry or just to show intimacy between speakers. This register can only be found in the Sundanese Priangan dialect, while other dialects such as Bantenese Language, generally do not recognize this register.

For many words, there are distinct &quot;loma&quot; and &quot;lemes&quot; forms, e.g. &quot;arék&quot; (loma) vs. &quot;badé&quot; (lemes) &quot;want&quot;, &quot;maca&quot; (loma) vs. &quot;maos&quot; (lemes) &quot;read&quot;. In the &quot;lemes&quot; level, some words further distinguish humble and respectful forms, the former being used to refer to oneself, and the latter for the addressee and third persons, e.g. &quot;rorompok&quot; &quot;(my own) house&quot; vs. &quot;bumi&quot; &quot;(your or someone else&#x27;s) house&quot; (the &quot;loma&quot; form is &quot;imah&quot;).

Similar systems of speech levels are found in Japanese, Korean and Thai.

==Grammar==
===Root word===

====Root verb====
====Plural form====
Other Austronesian languages (especially those in western Indonesia) commonly use reduplication to create plural forms. However, Sundanese inserts the &quot;ar&quot; infix into the stem word. If the stem word starts with &quot;l&quot;, or contains &quot;r&quot; following the infix, the infix &quot;ar&quot; becomes &quot;al&quot;. Also, as with other Sundanese infixes (such as &quot;um&quot;), if the word starts with vowel, the infix becomes a prefix. 
Examples: 
#&quot;Mangga téh, tarahuna haneut kénéh&quot;. &quot;Please ma&#x27;am, the bean curds are still warm/hot.&quot; The plural form of &quot;tahu&quot; &#x27;bean curd, tofu&#x27; is formed by infixing &quot;ar&quot; after the initial consonant. 
#&quot;Barudak leutik lalumpatan.&quot; &quot;Small children running around.&quot; &quot;Barudak&quot; &quot;children&quot; is formed from &quot;budak&quot; (child) with the &quot;ar&quot; infix; in &quot;lumpat&quot; (run) the &quot;ar&quot; infix becomes &quot;al&quot; because &quot;lumpat&quot; starts with &quot;l&quot;.
#&quot;Ieu kaén batik aralus sadayana&quot;. &quot;All of these batik clothes are beautiful.&quot; Formed from &quot;alus&quot; (nice, beautiful, good) with the infix &quot;ar&quot; that becomes a prefix because &quot;alus&quot; starts with a vowel. It denotes the adjective &quot;beautiful&quot; for the plural subject/noun (batik clothes).
#&quot;Siswa sakola éta mah balageur.&quot; &quot;The students of that school are well-behaved.&quot; Formed from &quot;bageur&quot; (&quot;good-behaving, nice, polite, helpful&quot;) with the infix &quot;ar&quot;, which becomes &quot;al&quot; because of &quot;r&quot; in the root, to denote the adjective &quot;well-behaved&quot; for plural students.

However, it is reported that this use of &quot;al&quot; instead of &quot;ar&quot; (as illustrated in (4) above) does not to occur if the &#x27;r&#x27; is in onset of a neighbouring syllable. For example, the plural form of the adjective &quot;curiga&quot; (suspicious) is &quot;caruriga&quot; and not *&quot;caluriga&quot;, because the &#x27;r&#x27; in the root occurs at the start of the following syllable.
The prefix can be reduplicated to denote &quot;very-&quot;, or the plural of groups. For example, &quot;bararudak&quot; denotes many, many children or many groups of children (&quot;budak&quot; is child in Sundanese). Another example, &quot;balalageur&quot; denotes plural adjective of &quot;very well-behaved&quot;.

===Active form===
Most active forms of Sundanese verbs are identical to the root, as with &quot;diuk&quot; &quot;sit&quot; or &quot;dahar&quot; &quot;eat&quot;. Some others depend on the initial phoneme in the root:
# Initial , , , , , , , , , can be put after prefix &quot;nga&quot; like in &quot;ngadahar&quot;.
# Initial , , , , can be put after prefix &quot;ng&quot; like in &quot;nginum&quot; &quot;drink&quot;.

===Negation===
There are several words to negate a statement in Sundanese. These are also different by the polite (&quot;lemes&quot;) and casual (&quot;loma&quot;) registers, as well as dialect.

====Polite====
In Priangan Sundanese, Polite negation is done by adding a henteu (the shorter form, teu is also commonly used) to negate most verbs (akin to adding a &quot;not&quot; to English &quot;do&quot; or &quot;does&quot;). To negate clauses where the subject is linked to adjectives or nouns (where, in English, it would normally require a linking verb like &quot;be&quot;), sanés is used.

* &quot;Abdi teu acan neda&quot;. &quot;I have not eaten yet.&quot;
In this sentence, &quot;acan&quot; is used to signpost that the speaker has not done something, but they will do it in a short notice.
* &quot;Buku abdi mah sanés nu ieu&quot;. &quot;My book is not this one.&quot;

Other words that can be used to negate clauses are moal (to signpost that the speaker is not going to do something) and alim (to show that the speaker does not want to do something). Other Sundanese dialects may have different ways to negate statements.

====Casual====
There are a wide range of casual negation helper words. In Priangan Sundanese, this can be done with a number of words.

* &quot;Urang acan dahar&quot;. &quot;I have not eaten yet.&quot;
The shorter version, &quot;can&quot;, is also commonly used especially in spoken speech.
* &quot;Buku Urang mah lain nu ieu&quot;. &quot;My book is not this one.&quot;
The word &quot;lain&quot; can be used as a casual variant of &quot;sanés&quot;.

Moal and its longer variant moal waka can also be used casually. Other words include &quot;teu hayang&quot; (which can also sound aggressive depending on context) and embung (which is somewhat a casual counterpart of &quot;alim&quot;).

===Question===
Dupi &quot;(for polite situation)&quot;/Ari &quot;(for formal situation)&quot;-(question)

example:

Polite:

* &quot;Dupi Tuang Rama nyondong di bumi?&quot; &quot;Is your father at home?&quot;
* &quot;Dupi bumi di palih mana?&quot; &quot;Where do you live?&quot;
Formal:

*&quot;Ari Bapa aya di imah?&quot; &quot;Is your father at home?&quot;
* &quot;Ari imah di beulah mana?&quot; &quot;Where do you live?&quot;

===Interrogatives===
===Passive form===
Polite:
*&quot;Buku dibantun ku abdi.&quot; &quot;The book is brought by me.&quot; &quot;Dibantun&quot; is the passive form &quot;ngabantun&quot; &quot;bring&quot;.
*&quot;Pulpén ditambut ku abdi.&quot; &quot;The pen is borrowed by me.&quot;
*&quot;Soal ieu dipidamel ku abdi.&quot; &quot;This problem is done by me.&quot;
*&quot;Kacasoca dianggo ku abdi.&quot; &quot;Glasses worn by me.&quot;
Formal:
*&quot;Buku dibawa ku urang.&quot; &quot;The book is brought by me.&quot; &quot;Dibawa&quot; is the passive form &quot;mawa&quot; &quot;bring&quot;.
*&quot;Pulpén diinjeum ku urang.&quot; &quot;The pen is borrowed by me.&quot;
*&quot;Soal ieu digawékeun ku urang.&quot; &quot;This problem is done by me.&quot;
*&quot;Tasma dipaké ku urang.&quot; &quot;Glasses worn by me.&quot;

===Adjectives===

Examples:

&quot;teuas&quot; (hard), &quot;tiis&quot; (cool for water and solid objects), &quot;tiris&quot; (cool for air), &quot;hipu&quot; (soft), &quot;lada&quot; (hot/spicy, usually for foods), &quot;haneut&quot; (warm), etc.

===Prepositions===

====Place====
Sundanese has three generic prepositions for spatial expressions:
* &quot;di&quot;: &#x27;in&#x27;, &#x27;at&#x27; etc., indicating position
*&quot;dina/na:&quot; &#x27;on&#x27;, &#x27;at&#x27; etc., indicating specific position
* &quot;ka&quot;: &#x27;to&#x27;, indicating direction (from places like city, country, buildings, rooms, street, human, entities, etc. and treating the noun as a place where something happens)
* &quot;kana&quot;: &#x27;to&#x27;, indicating specific direction (from things, tools, containers, plants, organs or parts of body, etc. and treating the noun as an object)
* &quot;ti&quot;: &#x27;from&#x27;, indicating origin
*&quot;tina&quot;: &#x27;from&#x27;, indicating specific origin
*h
*

Using different type of prepositions can result in different meanings.

di cai: at the bathroom/toilet

dina cai: inside of water 

ka cai: going to a bathroom/toilet

kana cai: into water

ti cai: (someone) comes from the bathroom/toilet

tina cai: (something) made of water, or (something) comes from water

ka mobil: going inside a car

kana mobil: something is done/happened to a car
To express more specific spatial relations (like &#x27;inside&#x27;, &#x27;under&#x27; etc.), these prepositions have been combined with locative nouns:
&quot;Di gigir/luhur/handap/tukang/hareup&quot; (also &quot;ka gigir&quot;, &quot;ti gigir&quot; etc.) are absolute adverial expressions without a following noun. To express relative position, they have to add the suffix &quot;-eun&quot;, e.g.:

Polite:
*&quot;di luhur bumi&quot; – &#x27;on top of the house&#x27;
*&quot;dina luhur lomari&quot; – &#x27;on top of the cupboard&#x27;
*&quot;ti pengker bumi&quot; – &#x27;from behind the house&#x27;, alternative version: pengkereun bumi
*&quot;tina pengker lomari&quot; – &#x27;from behind the cupboard&#x27;
Formal:
*&quot;di luhureun imah&quot; – &#x27;on top of the house&#x27;
*&quot;dina luhureun lomari&quot; – &#x27;on top of the cupboard&#x27;
*&quot;ti tukangeun imah&quot; – &#x27;from behind the house&#x27;
*&quot;tina tukangeun lomari&quot; – &#x27;from behind the cupboard&#x27;
&quot;Di jero,&quot; &quot;di luar&quot; and the polite forms &quot;luhur&quot; &amp; &quot;pengker&quot; can be used both with and without a following noun.

<doc id="294058" wikidata="Q5246536" url="?curid=294058" title="Dean Ween">
<text>Michael Melchiondo Jr. (born September 25, 1970), better known by his stage name Dean Ween, is an American guitarist, singer and a founding member of the alternative rock group Ween. He is currently active in the groups Ween, Moistboyz and The Dean Ween Group.

==Biography==
In 1984, Melchiondo met Aaron Freeman in a junior high school typing class, in their hometown of New Hope, Pennsylvania. The two adopted the fictitious surname Ween after the demon-god Boognish appeared to them, with Melchiondo taking up the name Dean Ween and Freeman the name Gene Ween.

In 1991, Melchiondo formed the punk rock duo Moistboyz with Guy Heller. Moistboyz have released five eponymous studio recordings.

Melchiondo made contributions to two projects by his friend Josh Homme: The Desert Sessions and Queens of the Stone Age. On the 2002 Queens of the Stone Age album &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, Melchiondo played guitar on &quot;Mosquito Song&quot;, &quot;Gonna Leave You&quot;, and &quot;Six Shooter&quot;.

In 2009 Melchiondo received his captain&#x27;s license and regularly leads fishing trips off the Jersey Shore as Mickey&#x27;s Guide Service.

In 2012, in the wake of Ween&#x27;s breakup, Melchiondo formed The Dean Ween Group. In August 2016 the Dean Ween Group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Deaner Album&quot;, was announced with the release of the first track entitled &quot;Mercedes Benz&quot;. On October 7, 2016 Melchiondo&#x27;s first-ever solo music video was released for the song &quot;Exercise Man&quot;, the music video was directed by Monica Hampton. &quot;The Deaner Album&quot; was subsequently released on October 21, 2016 through ATO Records. Melchiondo&#x27;s second solo album under The Dean Ween Group moniker, &quot;rock2&quot;, was released on March 16, 2018.

<text>Aaron Freeman (born March 17, 1970), better known by his stage name Gene Ween, is an American singer, guitarist and a founding member of the experimental alternative rock group Ween. Freeman, along with childhood friend Mickey Melchiondo (Dean Ween), started the group in the mid-1980s. Ween would expand to five members and perform together until May 2012 when Freeman abruptly quit the band due to his want to move forward with a solo career, as well as his desire to remain sober. Over the next few years, Freeman would briefly abandon the Gene Ween name and lead a new five-piece band called Freeman. Shortly after reviving the Gene Ween name as a solo act, to perform a series of Billy Joel tribute performances, Ween reunited in February 2016 for three concerts in Broomfield, Colorado. The band continued to perform and tour until going on an indefinite hiatus in August 2024.

== Career ==

Freeman and Melchiondo met in an eighth grade typing class in 1984, in New Hope, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where they both grew up. Both of them talked about bands they liked and playing their own music. Soon, they hung out and began jamming, recording most of what they put together. Ween&#x27;s music slowly progressed from a bedroom-style recording project, eventually signing to a major record label and transforming into a full live band.

Freeman occasionally played solo acoustic shows as a side project of Ween. In December 2008, Freeman began performing with Ween bassist Dave Dreiwitz, drummer Joe Russo, and guitarist Scott Metzger as The Gene Ween Band. The band&#x27;s shows featured rarely played Ween songs, a few covers, and Freeman-penned songs performed for the first time. Freeman would perform dozens of shows, both solo and with the Gene Ween Band, from 2008 to 2011.

In May 2012, Freeman suddenly announced his departure from Ween, as an attempt to rehabilitate himself after years of drug and alcohol abuse, which peaked during Ween&#x27;s 2011 tour. That same month, Partisan Records released Freeman&#x27;s debut solo LP, &quot;Marvelous Clouds&quot;, a collection of Rod McKuen cover songs produced by Ben Vaughn.

Two months after leaving Ween, he stopped using the name Gene Ween and began performing as Aaron Freeman. In November 2013, Freeman self-released &quot;Gener&#x27;s Gone: The Final Demo Recordings of Gene Ween&quot;, a six-song collection of demo tracks Freeman had previously recorded before dropping the Gene Ween moniker. The album was released digitally via Bandcamp. In 2014, Freeman formed a new five-piece band, aptly named Freeman. The band&#x27;s debut, titled &quot;Free-Man&quot;, was released on May 23, 2014, by Partisan Records. The second half of 2014 was spent touring alongside Arc Iris.

In 2015, Freeman returned to using the Gene Ween name for his &quot;Gene Ween Does Billy Joel&quot; tribute concerts. The band featured, among others, Paul Green and Dan Hickey of They Might Be Giants and performed shows in Woodstock and Brooklyn. Freeman described the return of the Gene Ween name as a positive thing:

Freeman also used the Gene Ween name when he joined Umphrey&#x27;s McGee onstage during their second set at the May 22, 2015 Summer Camp Music Festival. Jokingly referring to their collaboration as Godboner, Freeman and Umphrey&#x27;s McGee performed a set of Ween covers, as well as &quot;The Stranger&quot; by Billy Joel.

On November 16, 2015, Ween announced that they would reunite for three concerts at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado in February 2016. Ween continued to perform and tour until going on an indefinite hiatus in August 2024, citing Melchiondo&#x27;s mental health as a reason. Freeman has also continued performing outside of Ween, including a 2017 tour of his Gene Ween Does Billy Joel tribute show. Freeman was scheduled to perform with Umphrey&#x27;s McGee once again on June 21, 2020, until the event was cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Personal life ==
Aaron Freeman is married to Leah Ben-Ari, with whom he has one son. Freeman has one other child, musician Ashton Freeman, from a previous relationship, born in 1998. 

Freeman is Jewish.

Freeman lived and recorded at his home in Lambertville, New Jersey, until moving to Woodstock, New York, in 2012 and then Seattle, Washington, in 2020.

Freeman has talked about his drug use prior to his sobriety. He spoke openly and in detail about his personal life, drug use, and time spent in Ween on the &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot; podcast (episode 309).

<doc id="294060" wikidata="Q2013374" url="?curid=294060" title="Whitton, Lincolnshire">
<text>Whitton is a village and civil parish in North Lincolnshire, England. The 2011 census found 212 inhabitants, in 92 households. It is situated at the northern termination of the Lincoln Cliff range of hills, on the south shore of the Humber about below Trent Falls, and west of Barton-upon-Humber. The parish is bounded on the west by Alkborough, on the east by Winteringham (which also includes the Winteringham Haven Wildlife Reserve) and, to the south, by West Halton.

==Toponymy==

Cameron and Mills have suggested that the place name is an Old English masculine personal name (genitive &quot;-n&quot;) + Anglian &quot;ēg&quot;, hence &#x27;Hwita&#x27;s island of land&#x27;, but Ekwall thought the name meant ‘White Island’ perhaps assuming wrongly that the ground was chalky. Gelling pointed out that the settlement is situated on an obvious &quot;ēg&quot;, i.e. an &#x27;island&#x27; of dry land, projecting into the Humber Estuary, and surrounded on east and west by former marshy ground.

==History==

Whitton may have originated at the time the Romans crossed the Humber northward in 71 AD; first as a military camp and then later as a Roman villa, overlooking the river, with its temple a few yards to the east, where the Church now stands. It is possible that Whitton was a landing stage on the south bank for the Roman fort and civitas of &quot;Petuaria Parisorum&quot; at Brough across the river. Roman Coins of Claudius Gothicus (268–270 AD) and Constantine I (the Great) (309–337 AD) have been found in the fields.
&quot;Pevsner&quot; states that the Church tower &quot;re-uses massive blocks of Roman stone&quot;, but these blocks of millstone grit which are to be found in several local churches (such as neighbouring Winteringham) may have been transported down the Ouse and the Humber from York where Roman buildings were being dismantled, or may even have come from some sort of triumphal arch or structure (perhaps like the Arch of Constantine), which might have stood at the end of Ermine Street.

Whitton is mentioned in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Witenai&quot;. Before the Conquest lordship was held by Siward Barn, and after by Saswalo of Ettington, with Henry de Ferrers becoming Tenant-in-chief. Listed are of meadow, land for eight ploughs, two plough teams belonging to the lord, five men&#x27;s plough teams, ten (villagers) four (smallholders) and ten freemen. The land was valued at seven pounds.
The church is not mentioned in the &quot;Domesday&quot; survey. St. John the Baptist is a building of stone overlooking the Humber, consisting of a west tower, a small nave ( wide and long) with a chancel and a south vestry attached. The partly Romanesque (or Norman) tower contains three, now untolled, bells; the third bell is said to have been brought from the village of Welton, across the river in Yorkshire. The base of the tower forms a porch and the large tower arch, leading into the nave, is thought to be Romanesque. The font is also ancient and may be from the same period. The church seems to have been almost completely rebuilt in about 1797-8 when the elaborate crocketted pinnacles were removed from the top of the tower. A drawing, by Nattes, of 1794 shows a dilapidated structure with a south aisle and a south porch.

The church was reseated in 1865 at the expense of Lady Strickland, and between about 1892 and 1897 the nave, chancel and roof were entirely rebuilt from the designs of W. &amp; C. A. Bassett-Smith, architects, of London. On the north side of the chancel are two stained-glass windows, erected in 1918 to the memory of Henry Spilman who was killed in the First World War. In 1952–53 cracks in the tower were repaired under the direction of A.R Haynes, architect of Brigg.

A small part of the relatively new island of Whitton Island in the Humber Estuary falls within the parish.

<doc id="294061" wikidata="Q449676" url="?curid=294061" title="Dean of the College of Cardinals">
<text>The dean of the College of Cardinals () presides over the College of Cardinals in the Catholic Church, serving as &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (first among equals). The position was established in the 12th century. He always holds the rank of a cardinal bishop, and is assisted by a vice-dean. Both are elected by and from the cardinal bishops who are not Eastern Catholic patriarchs, with their election subject to papal confirmation. Except for presiding over the college, the dean and vice-dean have no power over the other cardinals. In the order of precedence in the Catholic Church, the dean and vice-dean, as the two most senior cardinals, are placed second and third, respectively, after the pope.

For centuries, the cardinal bishop who had been a bishop of a suburbicarian see the longest was the dean. This custom became a requirement with the canon law of 1917. On 26 February 1965, Pope Paul VI empowered the cardinal bishops to elect the dean from among their number. Both the dean and subdean must reside in Rome.

Until December 2019, the dean held the position until death or resignation; there was no mandatory age of retirement. Then, upon accepting Cardinal Angelo Sodano&#x27;s resignation as dean of the College of Cardinals, Pope Francis established that the dean would henceforth serve a five-year term that may be renewed once. In anticipation of the election of a new dean, Francis said: &quot;I am hoping they will elect someone who can carry this important responsibility full time.&quot; Nevertheless, on 6 February 2025, the Vatican announced that the Pope had extended indefinitely Cardinal Re&#x27;s mandate as dean.

==Responsibilities==
The dean summons the conclave for the purposes of electing a new pope following a death or resignation. The Dean presides over the daily meetings of the College of Cardinals in advance of the conclave and then presides over the conclave if his age does not prohibit his participation. The dean also has the responsibility of communicating the &quot;news of the Pope&#x27;s death to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See and to the Heads of the respective Nations&quot;. He is the public face of the Holy See until a new pope is elected. If he participates in the conclave, the dean asks the pope-elect if he accepts the election, and then asks the new pope what name he wishes to use. If the dean himself is elected pope, the aforementioned tasks are assumed by the sub-dean of the College of Cardinals. If the newly elected pope is not already a bishop, the dean ordains him a bishop.

The dean has &quot;the title of the diocese of Ostia, together with that of any other church to which he already has a title,&quot; such as his suburbicarian diocese. This has been the case since 1914, by decree of Pope Pius X—previous deans had given up their suburbicarian see and taken the joint title of Ostia and Velletri, which were separated in that same 1914 decree.

==Deans elected pope==
Nine Deans have been elected pope: 
#Corrado Demitri, elected Pope Anastasius IV in 1153
#Ubaldo Allucingoli, elected Pope Lucius III in 1181
#Ugolino di Conti was elected Pope Gregory IX in 1227 
#Rinaldo di Jenne was elected Pope Alexander IV in 1254
#Pedro Julião was elected Pope John XXI in September 1276
#Rodrigo Borgia was elected Pope Alexander VI in 1492 
#Alessandro Farnese was elected Pope Paul III in 1534
#Gian Pietro Carafa was elected Pope Paul IV in May 1555
#Joseph Ratzinger was elected Pope Benedict XVI in 2005

==List of deans==

The following is the list of deans of the Sacred College of Cardinals, separated into three groups to account for the Western Schism, which ended after the Council of Constance. The earliest attested reference to the &quot;College of Cardinals&quot; is at the Council of Reims in 1148.

Each name in the following list includes years of birth and death, then comma-separated years of cardinalate and deanship.
