<text>Kerry Lee Wood (born June 16, 1977) is an American former baseball pitcher who played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs, Cleveland Indians, and New York Yankees. Wood first came to prominence as a 20-year-old rookie, when he recorded 20 strikeouts in a one-hit shutout against the Houston Astros, which some have argued may be the greatest single-game pitching performance in MLB history. The game also made Wood the co-holder of the MLB record for strikeouts in a single game (20) and earned Wood the nickname &quot;Kid K&quot;. He was later named the 1998 National League Rookie of the Year.

Wood went on to record over 200 strikeouts in four out of his first five seasons, with a high of 266 in 2003. He holds several MLB strikeout records. Though he struggled with injuries throughout his career, Wood was twice named an All-Star. Wood transitioned to a relief pitcher in 2007 due to continued struggles with injuries, ultimately reviving his career as a closer. During his career, Wood was placed on the disabled list 14 times in 14 major league seasons, which included missing the entire 1999 season due to Tommy John surgery. After a slow start to the 2012 season, Wood retired on May 18, 2012.

==Early life==
Wood attended MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas, for his first three seasons of high-school baseball. He continued his education at Grand Prairie High School for his final season as a high-school player. As a senior, Wood went 14-0 with a 0.77 ERA and 159 strikeouts in 81 innings, and was named All-American and Texas 5A Player of the Year. Wood was high-school teammates with Kevin Walker. He initially committed to play college baseball at McLennan Community College in Waco.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Cubs===

====1995–1998====
The Chicago Cubs drafted Wood as the fourth overall selection in the 1995 Major League Baseball draft. Two days after being drafted, he started both ends of a doubleheader in the Texas state playoffs, throwing 175 pitches between the two games; the Cubs were outraged. He split his first professional season between the GCL Cubs and the Williamsport Cubs of the New York-Penn League.

Ranked as the 16th best prospect in baseball by &quot;Baseball America&quot; in 1996, he pitched to a 2.91 ERA with 136 strikeouts in 22 starts for the Daytona Cubs of the Florida State League. He was also considered the top prospect in the league and the Cubs organization. In 1997, &quot;Baseball America&quot; ranked Wood as the third best player in the game, behind only Andruw Jones and Vladimir Guerrero. He played for the Orlando Rays in Double-A and the Iowa Cubs in Triple-A. Wood also began the 1998 season in the minors, striking out 11 batters in a single five-inning start.

====1998====
Wood made his first appearance in the major leagues on April 12, 1998. In his fifth career start, on May 6, he threw a one-hit, no-walk, 20-strikeout shutout against the Houston Astros in Wrigley Field, tying Roger Clemens&#x27;s record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game and breaking Bill Gullickson&#x27;s single-game rookie record of 18 strikeouts in 1980. Wood allowed only two baserunners: Ricky Gutiérrez on an infield single and Craig Biggio, who was hit by a pitch with a count of one ball and two strikes. (Biggio had led the league in that category each of the previous three years and is second all-time in hit-by-pitches with 285.) Only seven balls reached fair territory. The Astros went on to lead the league in on-base percentage, and all of the regulars who were in the lineup, including the four who finished the season batting over .300, went hitless. The performance garnered a game score of 105 – the highest number ever calculated for a pitcher in a nine-inning game.

Wood finished the 1998 season with a 13–6 record; despite missing the last month of the season with elbow soreness, he easily won the National League Rookie of the Year award. He pitched one game in the playoffs, losing against the Atlanta Braves.

====1999–2003====
During spring training of 1999, he tore his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL). Wood underwent successful Tommy John surgery to repair damage to the UCL in his right elbow, and missed the entire 1999 season. Wood returned in 2000 and had an 8–7 record, but the following season, he returned to form. In 2001, Wood went 12–6 with a 3.36 ERA. He recorded a one-hit, 14-strikeout complete-game shutout on May 25, 2001. On August 3, 2001, he struck out nine batters and gave up only one run over eight innings to defeat Chan Ho Park and the Los Angeles Dodgers 2-1 to extend the Cubs&#x27; lead in National League Central to 3.5 games. The following season, Wood finished 12–11 with a 3.67 ERA, and did not miss a start all year long, setting career highs with 213.6 innings pitched and 33 starts. He had 217 strikeouts in both seasons.

In 2003, Wood set career highs with 266 strikeouts, 14 wins (as part of a 14–11 record), a 3.20 ERA, and two shutouts. He threw the fastest fastball in the majors among starters, averaging 95.4 miles per hour. He also walked 100 batters and surrendered 24 home runs, also career highs, but was selected as a National League All-Star and helped lead the Cubs to the playoffs as one half of &quot;Chicago Heat&quot; along with fellow pitcher Mark Prior.

Wood earned two wins in the Divisional Series against the Atlanta Braves and was the starter in Game 3 of the 2003 National League Championship Series, which the Cubs won in extra innings. However, the Cubs lost in seven games to the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins. In the decisive Game 7, Wood hit the first home run by a pitcher in an NLCS game since another Cub, Rick Sutcliffe, did so in Game 1 in 1984. However, the Marlins won the game 9-6. Wood was the losing pitcher and the Cubs were eliminated.

====2004–2006====
Wood went 8-9 during the 2004 season and was sidelined for nearly two months with a strained triceps. In 2005, Wood continued to struggle. On August 31, 2005, Wood underwent surgery and missed the remainder of the season. During spring training in 2006, Wood suffered several injuries that required an additional surgery (on his knee). On May 18, 2006, Wood returned to the Cubs&#x27; pitching rotation when he started and lost a home game against the Washington Nationals. In June, Wood returned to the disabled list (DL) with a sore shoulder. The following month, the Cubs announced that Wood had sustained a partially torn rotator cuff, which was likely to keep him from pitching again for the rest of the year. At the end of the 2006 season, the Cubs exercised their option on Wood&#x27;s contract and bought out the remaining $13M.

====2007–2008====
With his long history of injuries and inability to stay in the starting rotation, Wood accepted the Cubs&#x27; offer to return as a relief pitcher in 2007. Wood attempted to sustain a regular throwing schedule and appearances during spring training games. Wood was placed on the 15-day DL, though, with soreness in his elbow, and was then moved to the 60-day DL. Wood considered retiring if he continued to have pain in his throwing arm. He began playing catch on May 21. In his first rehabilitation assignment in Cubs Rookie Ball, he struck out all three batters he faced. On July 24, he pitched an inning with the Single-A Peoria Chiefs, throwing 9 pitches. He made back-to-back appearances on July 26 and July 27, throwing his fastball between 92 and 94 mph with no discomfort.

The Cubs activated Wood from the 60-day DL on August 3, causing many to believe that he would make his actual return on that day. In the seventh inning, however, Lou Piniella opted to send Bob Howry to the mound, and most fans, eager to see Kerry back on the hill, mistakenly gave Howry a standing ovation, only to realize moments later he was actually not Wood. Piniella later stated he wanted Wood to receive a &quot;softer landing&quot;, or in other words, make his return in a game where the Cubs have a comfortable lead over their opponents. Wood made his return on August 5, with the Cubs trailing the New York Mets by four runs. He pitched a single inning, during which he allowed one hit and struck out another batter. Piniella praised Wood&#x27;s performance, stating, &quot;He threw the ball real good&quot;, and &quot;His breaking ball had some bite to it, and he threw it up there about 93–94, about what we expected&quot;. He remained healthy appearing in 22 games and posting a 1–1 record with a solid 3.33 ERA.

Wood was generally limited to one inning per outing, not appearing in games on back-to-back days, though he did pitch in both halves of a doubleheader on September 15. Wood was a major contributor to the Cubs&#x27; NL Central Division Championship down the stretch in late September, earning a win and eight holds. Wood filed for free agency on November 11, 2007, though he suggested that he wanted to remain in pinstripes for the 2008 season. Despite multiyear offers from other teams, Wood agreed to a one-year, $4.2 million deal with the Cubs.

Wood, along with Bob Howry and Carlos Mármol, competed for the role as the Cubs&#x27; closer after Ryan Dempster was moved to the starting rotation. After posting a 2.84 ERA in the spring, Wood won the job. He recorded his first career save April 3, 2008, with a win over the Brewers. Wood recorded 34 saves in 39 opportunities, 82 strike-outs, and a 1.12 WHIP. He was selected to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game as a relief pitcher on July 6, 2008, along with six other teammates.

Wood was placed on the 15-day DL on July 24, 2008, with a blister on his right index finger.

On November 13, 2008, after acquiring closer Kevin Gregg from the Florida Marlins, Cubs general manager Jim Hendry announced that the organization did not plan to re-sign Wood. He had previously requested a multiyear contract with the team, but was deferred due to financial reasons. Wood stated he wished to remain with the Cubs, but also wanted to continue playing baseball.

===Cleveland Indians===

On December 13, 2008, Wood signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Indians.

Cubs fans showed their appreciation for him by giving him a standing ovation when the Indians played at Wrigley Field on June 19, 2009. During the 2010 season, Wood was placed on the disabled list until May 8 due to an upper back muscle strain. On July 17, 2010, Wood was placed on the disabled list for the 14th time in his major league career, this time due to a blister on his right index finger.

===New York Yankees===
Wood was traded from the Cleveland Indians to the New York Yankees on July 31, 2010, for Andrew Shive, Matt Cusick, and cash. With the Yankees, he went 2–0 with a 0.69 ERA in 24 games, including 21 straight scoreless appearances, and served as the bridge to Mariano Rivera in the 2010 postseason. During the 2010 postseason, Wood had a 2.25 ERA, appearing in seven games overall. The Yankees won the 2010 ALDS against the Minnesota Twins in three games, but lost to the Texas Rangers in 6 games of the 2010 ALCS.

The Yankees announced on October 27 that the club had declined to exercise their option for Wood for 2011.

===Chicago Cubs (second stint)===
On December 16, 2010, Wood agreed to a one-year deal worth $1.5 million with the Cubs. Wood reportedly turned down offers for long-term deals from several other teams worth more money due to his desire to keep his family in Chicago. Wood re-signed with the Cubs on January 13, 2012, for a one-year, $3 million deal with a team option for 2013.
Plagued by arm issues and a soaring ERA, Wood retired on May 18, 2012, striking out the only (and therefore final) batter he faced, Dayán Viciedo of the Chicago White Sox. The fans at Wrigley Field gave Wood a long standing ovation as his son, Justin, ran out to greet him as he exited the field. On his baseball career: &quot;I had fun, I had a blast&quot;, Wood said. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t trade anything in.&quot;

===MLB records===
*Fastest to reach 1,000 strikeouts in MLB history (in appearances): 134 games
*Fastest to reach 1,000 strikeouts in MLB history (in innings pitched): 853 IP
*Strikeouts in a nine-inning game: 20 on May 6, 1998 (tied record held by Roger Clemens, who accomplished it twice; Max Scherzer tied the record in 2016)

==Personal life==

On February 13, 1999, Wood and former high-school teammate Kevin Walker were ticketed for urinating in a parking lot at 1:10 am in Scottsdale, Arizona. Wood missed his initial court appearance and an arrest warrant was issued. He later pleaded guilty and paid a fine of $90.

Wood is married to Sarah Pates of Waukegan, Illinois. The couple has one son, Justin, and two daughters, Katie and Charlotte. Until 2008, the family resided in the Old Town neighborhood of Chicago.

While playing for the Cubs, the Woods hosted a celebrity bowling tournament called Kerry Wood&#x27;s Strike Zone, which also featured a silent auction that raised over $2 million.

On June 24, 2013, while paddleboarding in waters in Chicago, Wood happened upon a corpse floating in Belmont Harbor. He immediately reported the discovery to local authorities, who determined the deceased to be a 40-year-old man who had been reported missing by a North Side nursing home days earlier.

<text>Acoustical engineering (also known as acoustic engineering) is the branch of engineering dealing with sound and vibration. It includes the application of acoustics, the science of sound and vibration, in technology. Acoustical engineers are typically concerned with the design, analysis and control of sound.

One goal of acoustical engineering can be the reduction of unwanted noise, which is referred to as noise control. Unwanted noise can have significant impacts on animal and human health and well-being, reduce attainment by students in schools, and cause hearing loss. Noise control principles are implemented into technology and design in a variety of ways, including control by redesigning sound sources, the design of noise barriers, sound absorbers, suppressors, and buffer zones, and the use of hearing protection (earmuffs or earplugs).

Besides noise control, acoustical engineering also covers positive uses of sound, such as the use of ultrasound in medicine, programming digital synthesizers, designing concert halls to enhance the sound of orchestras and specifying railway station sound systems so that announcements are intelligible.

== Acoustic engineer (professional) ==

Acoustic engineers usually possess a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher qualification in acoustics, physics or another engineering discipline. Practicing as an acoustic engineer usually requires a bachelor&#x27;s degree with significant scientific and mathematical content. Acoustic engineers might work in acoustic consultancy, specializing in particular fields, such as architectural acoustics, environmental noise or vibration control. In other industries, acoustic engineers might: design automobile sound systems; investigate human response to sounds, such as urban soundscapes and domestic appliances; develop audio signal processing software for mixing desks, and design loudspeakers and microphones for mobile phones. Acousticians are also involved in researching and understanding sound scientifically. Some positions, such as faculty require a Doctor of Philosophy.

In most countries, a degree in acoustics can represent the first step towards professional certification and the degree program may be certified by a professional body. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated the title of Chartered Engineer (in most Commonwealth countries).

==Subdisciplines==

The listed subdisciplines are loosely based on the PACS (Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme) coding used by the Acoustical Society of America.

===Aeroacoustics===
Aeroacoustics is concerned with how noise is generated by the movement of air, for instance via turbulence, and how sound propagates through the fluid air. Aeroacoustics plays an important role in understanding how noise is generated by aircraft and wind turbines, as well as exploring how wind instruments work.

===Audio signal processing===
Audio signal processing is the electronic manipulation of audio signals using analog and digital signal processing. It is done for a variety of reasons, including:
* to enhance a sound, e.g. by applying an audio effect such as reverberation;
* to remove unwanted noises from a signal, e.g. echo cancellation in internet voice calls;
* to compress an audio signal to allow efficient transmission, e.g. perceptual coding in MP3 and Opus 
* to understand the content of the signal, e.g. identification of music tracks via music information retrieval.

Audio engineers develop and use audio signal processing algorithms.

===Architectural acoustics===

Architectural acoustics (also known as building acoustics) is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a building. Architectural acoustics can be about achieving good speech intelligibility in a theatre, restaurant or railway station, enhancing the quality of music in a concert hall or recording studio, or suppressing noise to make offices and homes more productive and pleasant places to work and live. Architectural acoustic design is usually done by acoustic consultants.

===Bioacoustics===
Bioacoustics concerns the scientific study of sound production and hearing in animals. It can include: acoustic communication and associated animal behavior and evolution of species; how sound is produced by animals; the auditory mechanisms and neurophysiology of animals; the use of sound to monitor animal populations, and the effect of man-made noise on animals.

===Electroacoustics===
This branch of acoustic engineering deals with the design of headphones, microphones, loudspeakers, sound systems, sound reproduction, and recording. There has been a rapid increase in the use of portable electronic devices which can reproduce sound and rely on electroacoustic engineering, e.g. mobile phones, portable media players, and tablet computers.

The term &quot;electroacoustics&quot; is also used to describe a set of electrokinetic effects that occur in heterogeneous liquids under influence of ultrasound.

===Environmental noise===

Environmental acoustics is concerned with the control of noise and vibrations caused by traffic, aircraft, industrial equipment, recreational activities and anything else that might be considered a nuisance. Acoustical engineers concerned with environmental acoustics face the challenge of measuring or predicting likely noise levels, determining an acceptable level for that noise, and determining how the noise can be controlled. Environmental acoustics work is usually done by acoustic consultants or those working in environmental health. Recent research work has put a strong emphasis on soundscapes, the positive use of sound (e.g. fountains, bird song), and the preservation of tranquility.

===Musical acoustics===
Musical acoustics is concerned with researching and describing the physics of music and its perception – how sounds employed as music work. This includes: the function and design of musical instruments including electronic synthesizers; the human voice (the physics and neurophysiology of singing); computer analysis of music and composition; the clinical use of music in music therapy, and the perception and cognition of music.

===Noise control===
Noise control is a set of strategies to reduce noise pollution by reducing noise at its source, by inhibiting sound propagation using noise barriers or similar, or by the use of ear protection (earmuffs or earplugs). Control at the source is the most cost-effective way of providing noise control. Noise control engineering applied to cars and trucks is known as noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH). Other techniques to reduce product noise include vibration isolation, application of acoustic absorbent and acoustic enclosures. Acoustical engineering can go beyond noise control to look at what is the best sound for a product, for instance, manipulating the sound of door closures on automobiles.

===Psychoacoustics===
Psychoacoustics tries to explain how humans respond to what they hear, whether that is an annoying noise or beautiful music. In many branches of acoustic engineering, a human listener is a final arbitrator as to whether a design is successful, for instance, whether sound localisation works in a surround sound system. &quot;Psychoacoustics seeks to reconcile acoustical stimuli and all the scientific, objective, and physical properties that surround them, with the physiological and psychological responses evoked by them.&quot;

===Speech===
Speech is a major area of study for acoustical engineering, including the production, processing and perception of speech. This can include physics, physiology, psychology, audio signal processing and linguistics. Speech recognition and speech synthesis are two important aspects of the machine processing of speech. Ensuring speech is transmitted intelligibly, efficiently and with high quality; in rooms, through public address systems and through telephone systems are other important areas of study.

===Ultrasonics===

Ultrasonics deals with sound waves in solids, liquids and gases at frequencies too high to be heard by the average person. Specialist areas include medical ultrasonics (including medical ultrasonography), sonochemistry, nondestructive testing, material characterisation and underwater acoustics (sonar).

===Underwater acoustics===
Underwater acoustics is the scientific study of sound in water. It is concerned with both natural and man-made sound and its generation underwater; how it propagates, and the perception of the sound by animals. Applications include sonar to locate submerged objects such as submarines, underwater communication by animals, observation of sea temperatures for climate change monitoring, and marine biology.

===Vibration and dynamics===
Acoustic engineers working on vibration study the motions and interactions of mechanical systems with their environments, including measurement, analysis and control. This might include: ground vibrations from railways and construction; vibration isolation to reduce noise getting into recording studios; studying the effects of vibration on humans (vibration white finger); vibration control to protect a bridge from earthquakes, or modelling the propagation of structure-borne sound through buildings.

==Fundamental science==

Although the way in which sound interacts with its surroundings is often extremely complex, there are a few ideal sound wave behaviours that are fundamental to understanding acoustical design. Complex sound wave behaviors include absorption, reverberation, diffraction, and refraction. Absorption is the loss of energy that occurs when a sound wave reflects off of a surface, and refers to both the sound energy transmitted through and dissipated by the surface material. Reverberation is the persistence of sound caused by repeated boundary reflections after the source of the sound stops. This principle is particularly important in enclosed spaces. Diffraction is the bending of sound waves around surfaces in the path of the wave. Refraction is the bending of sound waves caused by changes in the medium through which the wave is passing. For example, temperature gradients can cause sound wave refraction. Acoustical engineers apply these fundamental concepts, along with mathematical analysis, to control sound for a variety of applications.

<text>The Adventures of Tom Bombadil is a 1962 collection of poetry by J. R. R. Tolkien. The book contains 16 poems, two of which feature Tom Bombadil, a character encountered by Frodo Baggins in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The rest of the poems are an assortment of bestiary verse and fairy tale rhyme. Three of the poems appear in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as well. The book is part of Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium.

The volume includes &quot;The Sea-Bell&quot;, subtitled &quot;Frodos Dreme&quot;, which W. H. Auden considered Tolkien&#x27;s best poem. It is a piece of metrical and rhythmical complexity that recounts a journey to a strange land beyond the sea. Drawing on medieval &#x27;dream vision&#x27; poetry and Irish &quot;immram&quot; poems, the piece is markedly melancholic and the final note is one of alienation and disillusion.

The book was originally illustrated by Pauline Baynes and later by Roger Garland. The book, like the first edition of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, is presented as if it is an actual translation from the &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;, and contains some background information on the world of Middle-earth that is not found elsewhere: e.g. the name of the tower at Dol Amroth and the names of the Seven Rivers of Gondor. There is some fictional background information about those poems, linking them to Hobbit folklore and literature and to their supposed writers, in some cases Sam Gamgee.

== Publication history ==

&quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; was first published as a stand-alone book in 1962. Some editions, such as the Unwin Paperbacks edition (1975) and &quot;Poems and Stories&quot;, erroneously state that it was first published in 1961. Tolkien&#x27;s letters confirm that 1962 is the correct year. 
Beginning with &quot;The Tolkien Reader&quot; in 1966, it was included in anthologies of Tolkien&#x27;s shorter works. This trend continued after his death with &quot;Poems and Stories&quot; (1980) and &quot;Tales from the Perilous Realm&quot; (1997).
In 2014 Christina Scull and Wayne G. Hammond edited a new stand-alone edition, which includes for each poem detailed commentary, original versions and their sources.

Only one of the poems, &quot;Bombadil Goes Boating&quot;, was written specially for the book.

Seven of the works in the book are included on the 1967 album of Tolkien&#x27;s songs and poems, &quot;Poems and Songs of Middle Earth&quot;. Six are read by Tolkien; the seventh, &quot;Errantry&quot;, is set to music by Donald Swann.

== Contents ==

The poems are all supposedly works that Hobbits enjoyed; all are in English. Several are attributed in a mock-scholarly preface to Hobbit authors or traditions. Three are also among the many poems in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

== Reception ==

A 1963, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described the book&#x27;s verses as &quot;roll[ing] along in strange meters and weird words&quot;. It called the poems &quot;difficult fun to read aloud&quot;, but suggested that the Stone Troll and Bombadil himself, though &quot;memorable acquaintances&quot;, might be enjoyed more by adults than by children.

Richard C. West wrote that the book was the idea of Tolkien&#x27;s aunt, Jane Neave, who wanted something about Tom Bombadil, resembling one of Beatrix Potter&#x27;s Little Books; but that his publishers wanted a larger volume. Accordingly, he assembled what he had, on the theme of poems that Hobbits might enjoy, grouping them as the editors Scull and Hammond (in the 2015 edition) say &quot;like with like as far as possible&quot;, complete with &quot;mock-scholarly preface&quot;.

<text>Cynthia Jeanne Shaheen ( ; née Bowers, born January 28, 1947) is an American politician and former educator serving since 2009 as the senior United States senator from New Hampshire. A member of the Democratic Party, she also served from 1997 to 2003 as the 78th governor of New Hampshire. Shaheen is the first woman elected as both a governor and a U.S. senator, and the first woman elected governor of New Hampshire.

After serving two terms in the New Hampshire Senate, Shaheen was elected governor in 1996 and reelected in 1998 and 2000. In 2002, she unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate against Republican nominee John E. Sununu. She served as director of the Harvard Institute of Politics before resigning to run for the U.S. Senate again in the 2008 election, defeating Sununu in a rematch. She is the dean of New Hampshire&#x27;s congressional delegation, serving in Congress since 2009.

Shaheen became the first Democratic senator from New Hampshire since John A. Durkin, who was defeated in 1980. In 2014, she became the second Democrat from New Hampshire to be reelected to the Senate and the first since Thomas J. McIntyre in 1972. She was reelected to a third term in 2020, defeating Republican nominee Bryant Messner.
==Personal life, education and pre-political career==
Jeanne Shaheen was born Cynthia Jeanne Bowers in St. Charles, Missouri, the daughter of Belle Ernestine (Stillings) and Ivan E. Bowers.

Shaheen graduated from high school in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania and a master&#x27;s degree in political science from the University of Mississippi. She taught high school in Mississippi and moved to New Hampshire in 1973, where she taught school and, with her husband, owned a store that sold used jewelry. She is married to Bill Shaheen, an attorney and judge. They have three children.

==Early political career==
A Democrat, she worked on several campaigns, including Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 1976 presidential campaign, and as the New Hampshire campaign manager for Gary Hart in 1984, before running for office in 1990, when she was elected to the state Senate for the 21st district. She was elected governor of New Hampshire in 1996 and reelected in 1998 and 2000.

In April 2005, Shaheen was named director of Harvard&#x27;s Institute of Politics, succeeding former U.S. Representative and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman.

==Governor of New Hampshire==
Shaheen&#x27;s decision to run for New Hampshire governor followed the retirement of Republican Governor Steve Merrill. Her opponent in 1996 was Ovide M. Lamontagne, then chairman of the State Board of Education. Shaheen presented herself as a moderate. According to a PBS profile, she focused on education funding issues, and pledged to expand kindergarten. She defeated Lamontagne by 57 to 40 percent.

Shaheen was the first woman to be elected governor of New Hampshire. (She was not, however, the first woman to serve as New Hampshire&#x27;s governor; Vesta M. Roy was acting governor from December 30, 1982, until January 6, 1983.)

In 1998, she was reelected by a margin of 66 to 31 percent.

In both 1996 and 1998, Shaheen took a no-new-taxes pledge. After a court decision preventing education from being largely supported by local taxes, &quot;her administration devised a plan that would have increased education spending and set a statewide property tax.&quot;

Running for a third term in 2000, Shaheen refused to renew her no-new-taxes pledge, becoming the first New Hampshire governor in 38 years to win an election without making that pledge. Shaheen&#x27;s preferred solution to the school-funding problem was not a broad-based tax but legalized video-gambling at state racetracks—a solution repeatedly rejected by the state legislature.

In 2001 Shaheen tried to implement a 2.5% sales tax, the first broad-based tariff of its kind in New Hampshire, which has never had a sales tax. The state legislature rejected her proposal. She also proposed an increase in the state&#x27;s cigarette tax and a 4.5% capital gains tax.

==Presidential politics==

===2000===
During the 2000 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, Shaheen supported Al Gore, and her husband served as Gore&#x27;s New Hampshire campaign manager. According to the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, the Shaheens were critical in helping Gore win a narrow victory in the New Hampshire primary over Bill Bradley.

Gore added Shaheen to his short list of potential vice presidential nominees, which also included Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, North Carolina Senator John Edwards, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, and Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman. Shaheen responded to speculation by stating she wasn&#x27;t interested in the job.

===2004===
After a short time teaching at Harvard University (and a fellowship in the Institute of Politics with former Massachusetts Governor Jane Swift), Shaheen was named national chairperson of John Kerry&#x27;s 2004 presidential campaign in September 2003.

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===

====2002====
After three two-year terms as governor, Shaheen declined to run for a fourth, instead choosing to run for the U.S. Senate in 2002. Republican John E. Sununu defeated her by a 51 percent to 47 percent margin (19,751 votes). In an interview with the &quot;Concord Monitor&quot;, Shaheen attributed her loss in part to &quot;discussion about the job that [she] did as governor.&quot; At that time, early Republican advertisements slammed her support for putting a sales tax on the ballot or faulted her for failing schools.

In June 2004, former Republican consultant Allen Raymond pleaded guilty to jamming Democratic Party lines set up to get New Hampshire Democrats to the polls in 2002, which some (most notably former Senator Bob Smith, whom Sununu defeated in the Republican primary) believe contributed to Shaheen&#x27;s loss. A judge sentenced Raymond to five months in jail in February 2005. Charles McGee, the former state GOP executive director, was sentenced to seven months for his role.

Raymond alleged that James Tobin, Northeast field director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, masterminded the plot. In December 2005, Tobin was convicted of two federal felonies arising from the phone-jamming and sentenced to ten months in prison, but that conviction was reversed on appeal. In October 2008, prosecutors filed two new felony indictments charging that Tobin lied to an FBI agent when he was interviewed in 2003 about his role in the phone-jamming case. These charges were summarily dismissed in 2009 after the federal judge in Maine&#x27;s District Court found them motivated by &quot;vindictive prosecution&quot;.

====2008====
In early July 2007 through UNH, CNN and WMUR put out a poll showing that Shaheen would beat Sununu in the 2008 Senate race (54–38). Other Democratic candidates did not have this type of lead, which led many to believe Shaheen would be the best choice to beat Sununu.

In April 2007, Shaheen met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer (D-New York) about a Senate run. Both said she would have strong support from the DSCC if she ran. On September 14, 2007, Shaheen announced her candidacy. On September 15, she formally launched her campaign at her home in Madbury, New Hampshire. On September 21, EMILY&#x27;s List endorsed her campaign.

Shaheen defeated Sununu 52% to 45% (44,535 votes).

====2014====
Shaheen ran for reelection in 2014, facing former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown.

In March 2014, Brown announced he was forming an exploratory committee to run against Shaheen. According to the Boston Herald, &quot;Granite State Republicans are calling U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen a hypocrite for asking potential GOP challenger and former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown to keep &quot;outside&quot; money out of the campaign while she fills the Democratic war chest on the West Coast&quot;.

In June 2014, WMUR reported that Shaheen had never released her tax returns in her 18 years of public service in New Hampshire. Shaheen said she would not rule out releasing her returns, but would like to see her opponent do so first.

She was endorsed again by Emily&#x27;s List.

On election night, even as her party lost control of the Senate, Shaheen won reelection with 51% of the vote to Brown&#x27;s 48%. As a measure of how Republican New Hampshire once was, Shaheen is only the second Democrat in the state&#x27;s history to win two terms in the Senate.

==== 2020 ====

Shaheen was reelected in 2020 with 57% of the vote to Republican nominee Bryant “Corky” Messner&#x27;s 41%. She is the first New Hampshire Democrat elected to three full terms in the Senate. The only other Democrat to be popularly elected more than once from New Hampshire, Thomas J. McIntyre (who held the seat Shaheen currently holds), served the remainder of Styles Bridges&#x27;s last term before being elected to two terms in his own right.

===Tenure===
On January 3, 2009, Shaheen was sworn into the United States Senate. As a senator, she has sponsored 288 bills, five of which have become law.

On January 6, 2021, Shaheen was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. She tweeted during the attack that she and her staff were safe and that &quot;We will not be stopped from doing our Constitutional duty&quot;. The day after the attack, Shaheen called Trump &quot;unfit for office&quot; and said that she supported impeaching him and removing him from office.

In 2024, Shaheen was ranked among the top 10 most bipartisan senators.

==Political positions==
===Health care===

In 2009, Shaheen partnered with U.S. Senator Susan Collins to introduce the Medicare Transitional Care Act, which provides follow-up care for discharged hospital patients to reduce re-hospitalizations. The bill passed in 2010, and research at the University of Pennsylvania predicted the measure would lower the cost of health care by as much as $5,000 per Medicare beneficiary while also improving health care quality and reducing re-hospitalizations.

In December 2009, Shaheen voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; commonly called the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare).

In advance of the rollout of the PPACA, Shaheen said that people who liked their current health care plans could keep them. When asked about individuals who were losing their health care plans due to the PPACA, Shaheen said people could keep their health care plans if they were &quot;willing to pay more.&quot;

In August 2019, Shaheen was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to help states and Congress understand the potential consequences of the Texas v. United States Affordable Care Act lawsuit, writing that an overhaul of the present health care system would form &quot;an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets&quot;.

In October 2019, Shaheen was one of 27 senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer advocating the passage of the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, which was set to expire the following month. The senators warned that if the funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was allowed to expire, it &quot;would cause an estimated 2,400 site closures, 47,000 lost jobs, and threaten the health care of approximately 9 million Americans.&quot;

===Fiscal===
On October 11, 2011, Shaheen voted to proceed with a proposed bill that included $446 billion in spending on infrastructure and schools and provided funding for state and local governments, as well as an extension of the payroll tax deduction. The spending would have been paid for by a 5.6% surtax on incomes above $1 million. The bill failed to obtain cloture.

Shaheen used an earmark in a large appropriations bill to restore funding for a federal prison in Berlin, NH, despite a $276 million recommended cut.

===Gun policy===
Shaheen supports making it illegal for individuals on the terrorist watchlist to buy guns and voted in favor of a bill proposing to expand background checks for gun purchases. She also voted to ban magazines of over 10 bullets. In 2016, she participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster in the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting. Shaheen said that &quot;moments of sympathy are not enough&quot; and that common-sense gun laws must be enacted.

===Energy===
Following the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, Shaheen proposed abolishing the Minerals Management Service, the U.S. government agency tasked with regulating offshore drilling, arguing that reform had been insufficient and that a new agency was needed. Shaheen also proposed legislation giving the president&#x27;s bipartisan BP Oil Spill Commission subpoena power in its investigation. She argued that subpoena power was necessary to avoid another such disaster, emphasizing the spill&#x27;s economic costs to the Gulf Coast region and the economy as a whole.

On April 28, 2014, Shaheen introduced the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2014 (S. 2262; 113th Congress), a bill intended to improve efficient energy use.

In March 2019 Shaheen was an original cosponsor of a bipartisan bill intended to mandate that the Environmental Protection Agency declare per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous substances that can be addressed with cleanup funds via the EPA Superfund law and require that polluters undertake or pay for remediation within a year of the bill&#x27;s enaction.

Shaheen opposed the Nord Stream 2, a pipeline for delivering natural gas from Russia to Germany.

===Iraq War===
In 2002, when Shaheen narrowly lost to Sununu, she supported both the 2003 invasion of Iraq and &quot;regime change&quot; for Iraq. Shaheen said that she came to supporting the policy of removing Saddam Hussein from power after meeting with former Clinton-administration National Security Advisor Sandy Berger. According to the &quot;Concord Monitor&quot; and Associated Press, the issue was a minor one in the race.

Shaheen later questioned George W. Bush&#x27;s handling of the situation in Iraq. In a September 2004 televised interview as Kerry presidential campaign chair she said:

George [W.] Bush has taken us in the wrong direction. He misled us into war in Iraq. That war has not made us safer and more secure at home ... You know, we have not stabilized Afghanistan. We have not stabilized Iraq. There is no plan to win the peace.
On July 28, 2004, while serving as Chair of the Kerry-Edwards Campaign, Shaheen answered questions about her prior support of the Iraq war during an interview on C-SPAN.

===War in Afghanistan===

Shaheen opposed the 2021 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan under President Joe Biden.

===LGBT rights===
Shaheen initially opposed same-sex marriage as governor of New Hampshire, but in 2009 she came out in favor of marriage for same-sex couples and sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act. She also voted in favor of the repeal of Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell, and supports government recognition of same-sex spouses of military and other government personnel.

===Minimum wage===
On March 5, 2021, Shaheen voted against Bernie Sanders&#x27;s amendment to include a $15/hour minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

===Immigration===
In 2025, Shaheen was one of 12 Senate Democrats who joined all Republicans to vote for the Laken Riley Act.

<text>The 1959 Governor General&#x27;s Awards for Literary Merit were the 24th rendition of the Governor General&#x27;s Awards, Canada&#x27;s annual national awards program, which then comprised literary awards alone. The awards recognized Canadian writers for new works published in Canada during 1959. 

Canada Council for the Arts took over administration of the program sometime during 1959 or 1960 – after the 1958 Governor General&#x27;s Awards that recognized 1958 publications. Canada Council arranged for the first cash prizes to award-winning writers, &quot;at least 6 prizes of $1000 each for fiction, nonfiction, and drama or poetry in English and French&quot;. Thus, the program was expanded to cover French- as well as English-language works. Otherwise, the number of award categories was reduced from five to three – the juvenile category eliminated after 10 years, the double recognition of non-fiction after 17 years.

In the event, only four awards were conferred for 1959 publications, two for English-language and two for French.

<text>Abbas I (; 27 January 1571 – 19 January 1629), commonly known as Abbas the Great (), was the fifth Safavid shah of Iran from 1588 to 1629. The third son of Shah Mohammad Khodabanda, he is generally considered one of the most important rulers in Iranian history and the greatest ruler of the Safavid dynasty.

Although Abbas would preside over the apex of Safavid Iran&#x27;s military, political and economic power, he came to the throne during a troubled time for the country. Under the ineffective rule of his father, the country was riven with discord between the different factions of the Qizilbash army, who killed Abbas&#x27; mother and elder brother. Meanwhile, Iran&#x27;s main enemies, its arch-rival the Ottoman Empire and the Uzbeks, exploited this political chaos to seize territory for themselves. In 1588, one of the Qizilbash leaders, Murshid Quli Khan, overthrew Shah Mohammed in a coup and placed the 16-year-old Abbas on the throne. However, Abbas soon seized power for himself.

Under his leadership, Iran developed the ghilman system where thousands of Circassian, Georgian, and Armenian slave-soldiers joined the civil administration and the military. With the help of these newly created layers in Iranian society (initiated by his predecessors but significantly expanded during his rule), Abbas managed to eclipse the power of the Qizilbash in the civil administration, the royal house, and the military. These actions, as well as his reforms of the Iranian army, enabled him to fight the Ottomans and Uzbeks and reconquer Iran&#x27;s lost provinces, including Kakheti, whose people he subjected to widescale massacres and deportations. By the end of the 1603–1618 Ottoman War, Abbas had regained possession over Transcaucasia and Dagestan, as well as swaths of Western Armenia and Mesopotamia. He also took back land from the Portuguese and the Mughals and expanded Iranian rule and influence in the North Caucasus, beyond the traditional territories of Dagestan.

Abbas was a great builder and moved his kingdom&#x27;s capital from Qazvin to Isfahan, making the city the pinnacle of Safavid architecture. In his later years, following a court intrigue involving several leading Circassians, Abbas became suspicious of his own sons and had them killed or blinded.

== Early life ==
Born in 27 January 1571 in Herat, Abbas was the third son of Mohammad Khodabanda and his wife, Khayr al-Nisa Begum. His father was the first-born son of Tahmasp I, the second Shah of Safavid Iran. He chose the name Abbas for the infant. Abbas&#x27; father, Mohammad Khodabanda, was the governor of Herat, the capital city of the major province of Khorasan. Mohammad Khodanbanda was disqualified from succeeding his father because an eye disease had left him almost completely blind. The Safavid court chronicler, Iskandar Beg Monshi, describes Mohammad Khodabanda as ‘a pious, ascetic and gentle soul’. Abbas&#x27; mother, Khayr al-Nisa Begum, was the daughter of Mir Abdollah II, a local ruler in the province of Mazandaran from the Mar&#x27;ashi dynasty who claimed descent from the fourth Shi&#x27;ia imam, Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin. She and Mohammad Khodabanda had already two children before Abbas, Hassan and Hamza, and she gave birth to two more sons later: Abu Taleb and Tahmasp.

When Abbas was barely eighteen months old, he was separated from his father and his mother, who were transferred by Tahmasp to govern the city of Shiraz. The nominal governorship of Herat was handed over to Abbas. At first, Tahmasp intended to make Hamza the governor of Herat, but Khayr al-Nisa Begum was unwilling to be separated from Hamza, who was her favourite son. So she persuaded the king to appoint Abbas instead. The fact that Abbas was still a baby was not considered an obstacle, as Tahmasp himself had been appointed titular governor of Khorasan at the age of two.

Shah Qoli Sultan Ustajlu, an &quot;amir&quot; from one of the Qizilbash tribes called the Ustajlu tribe, was appointed as the actual governor and as Abbas&#x27;s &quot;lala&quot; (guardian). Abbas&#x27;s Qizilbash guardians and their wives became substitute parents for him. He never saw his mother again and only saw his father fifteen years later. Abbas learnt the necessary skills of a soldier from his Qizilbash guardians. He played polo and went frequently on hunts. Like most of the Iranian kings, he developed a passion for hunting, which was regarded as a form of military training. Abbas was educated alongside household &quot;slaves&quot; (ghulams), who would have become his childhood companions. Some or perhaps most of them are likely to have been Georgians, Armenians or Circassians.

On 14 May 1576, Tahmasp I died without a designated heir, which led to the realm descending into civil war. The following day, Tahmasp I&#x27;s favourite son, Haydar Mirza, proclaimed himself king with the support of the Ustajlu tribe and the powerful court Georgians. However, he was immediately overthrown and killed by the &quot;qurchis&quot; (the royal bodyguards). After his death, with the support of the majority of the Qizilbash tribes and the endorsement of Tahmasp&#x27;s influential daughter, Pari Khan Khanum, Ismail Mirza, who had been imprisoned by his father for twenty years, was crowned king as Ismail II. The new king&#x27;s reign turned out to be short and murderous. The long years of imprisonment had left him suffering from paranoia, with the result that he saw enemies everywhere who had to be eliminated. First and foremost, he began murdering most of the members of Ustajlu tribe regardless of whether or not they had supported Haydar Mirza. He also executed people whose only crime was having held a position during Tahmasp&#x27;s reign. The young Abbas was directly affected by his uncle&#x27;s purge when a group of horsemen rushed into his guardian&#x27;s house, Shah Qoli Sultan, and killed him.

Ismail then turned on his family. He ordered the execution of many of his half-brothers, cousins and nephews. He spared Mohammad Khodabandae, possibly because they were full-brothers and perhaps because Mohammad Khodabanda was already blind and disqualified as a possible claimant to the throne. In November 1577, however, Ismail dispatched Ali-Qoli Khan from the Shamlu tribe to Herat to kill the young Abbas. Ali-Qoli delayed Abbas&#x27; execution, giving as a reason that it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; to execute an &quot;innocent&quot; descendant of a seyed on holy days (&quot;Qadr Night&quot; and &quot;Eid al-Fitr&quot;). This dealy saved Abbas&#x27; life, for on 24 November 1577, Ismail II died from consuming poisoned opium, and Ali-Qoli Khan assumed the governorship of Herat and the role of guardian of Abbas.

On 11 or 13 February 1578, Mohammad Khodabanda was chosen by the Qizilbash as the new shah. The new shah appeared weak, indifferent and incompetent. In these circumstances power soon passed into other hands. Abbas&#x27; mother, Khayr al-Nisa Begum, was a strong-willed woman. She took complete charge of the administration and made all the decisions, even in military matters. The Qizilbash were not happy to see her taking power. The divisions in the Safavid court encouraged rebellions in various parts of the country and the old Qizilbash rivalries rose again, with the Ustajlu and Shamlu tribes immediately confronting each other. Mohammad Khodabanda and the queen asked Ali-Qoli Khan to bring Abbas to Qazvin, fearing that Ali-Qoli Khan was conspiring to enthrone Abbas, but the Qizilbash amirs of Khorasan argued that with the threat of the Uzbeks of Bukhara raiding near Herat, the presence of a prince in the city was necessary.

The weak state of the realm led to the Ottoman Empire declaring war against Iran in 1578. The Safavid armies suffered several defeats before Khayr al-Nisa Begum organised a counter-offensive. Together with her son, Hamza Mirza and the grand vizier, Mirza Salman Jaberi, she led an army north to confront the Ottoman and Tatar forces in Shirvan. But her attempt to dictate the campaign strategy angered the Qizilbash amirs. Eventually, on 26 July 1579, the Qizilbash stormed into the harem where the queen resided and strangled Khayr al-Nisa Begum. Although Abbas was still only a boy and barely knew his mother, her murder at the hands of the Qizilbash made a deep impression on him. That experience probably led to his belief that the power of the Qizilbash had to be broken.

== Ascension ==

After the queen&#x27;s death, Hamza Mirza, aged eleven, was proclaimed crown prince. The Qizilbash found no reason to fear a child. So they took control over the realm while fighting among themselves over the division of power. The conflict was most intense at the court in Qazvin and in Khorasan, where Ali-Qoli Khan Shamlu, and his principal ally, Murshid Qoli Khan Ustajlu, had for some time been at war with the Turkman governor of Mashhad, Morteza Quli Khan Pornak. The Takkalu tribe eventually seized the power in Qazvin and proceeded to purge a number of prominent Shamlu members, among them being the mother and father of Ali-Qoli Khan. This angered Ali-Qoli Khan and, just as the queen had predicted, in 1581, he took arms against the crown and made his ward, the ten-year-old Abbas, the figurehead of a rebellion in Khorasan by proclaiming him Shah of Iran. Ali-Qoli and Murshid Qoli Khan took control of Nishapur; there, they struck coins and read &quot;khutba&quot; in Abbas&#x27; name.

In the following year, an army from western Iran advanced into Khorasan to resolve the situation. This army laid siege to Torbat-e Heydarieh, where Murshid Qoli was in control, and on Herat, where both Ali-Qoli Khan and Abbas resided. Both attempts proved futile. Upon hearing the news of another Ottoman attack on northwest Iran, the leading ministers of the campaign hurriedly reached an agreement with Ali-Qoli Khan. The former rebel suffered no repercussions and only had to pledge loyalty to Hamza Mirza as the heir apparent. He remained as the governor and as Abbas&#x27; guardian and even received a reward from the shah. Mohammad Khodabanda removed Ali-Qoli Khan&#x27;s old enemy, Morteza Quli Khan Pornak, from his position as governor of Mashhad and replaced him with an Ustajlu amir. According to Iskandar Beg Monshi, many came to believe Abbas Mirza&#x27;s claim would eventually prevail over Hamza Mirza&#x27;s.

Meanwhile, Hamza Mirza was preoccupied with pushing the Ottomans out of Tabriz. However, he became caught up in the rivalries between the Qizilbash tribes and angered his officers by executing the Qizilbash governor of Azarbaijan. On 5 December 1586, he was assassinated by his personal barber, who may have had been bribed by a group of Qizilbash conspirators. This assassination provided a pathway for Abbas&#x27; ascension.

In the meantime, in Khorasan, Murshid Qoli Khan emerged as a rival to Ali-Qoli. He successfully seized Mashhad and abducted Abbas from Ali-Qoli&#x27;s possession. An Uzbek invasion advanced through Khorasan and laid siege to Herat. This threatened Murshid Qoli&#x27;s position who realised it was his last chance to enthrone Abbas. Many of the Qizilbash amirs gave their assurance of their support for placing Abbas on the throne. After learning that Mohammad Khodabanda had left Qazvin to confront rebels in the south, Murshid Qoli Khan decided to strike.

During the first ten days of Ramadan 1586, Abbas, his guardian and a small escort of not more than a few hundred horsemen, decided to ride towards Qazvin. As they rode along the Silk Road, Qizilbash amirs from the powerful Takkalu, Afshar and Zul al-Qadr tribes, who controlled many of the key towns on the way, came to pledge their allegiance. By the time they approached Qazvin, their small force had increased to 2,000 armed horsemen. The lord mayor of Qazvin and the Qizilbash amirs inside the city at first urged resistance. But they gave up when crowds of citizens and soldiers, anxious to avoid fighting, came out onto the streets and voiced their support for Abbas, who rode into the capital beside Murshid Qoli Khan in late-September 1587.

Mohammad Khodabanda and his heir apparent, Abu Taleb Mirza, and their entourage of Ustajlu and Shamlu amirs, were camped 200 miles away in the city of Qom. When the news reached them, the amirs decided to abandon the shah and his heir for Abbas Mirza. Mohammad Khodabanda decide that he had no choice but to abdicate. On 1 October 1587, at a ceremony in the palace in Qazvin, he placed his crown on the head of his seventeen-year-old son, who ascended the throne as Abbas I. Murshid Qoli Khan, to whom Abbas owed the crown, was rewarded with the title of &quot;vakil&quot; (viceroy).

==Rule as shah==
===Abbas takes control===
The empire Abbas inherited was in a desperate state. The Ottomans had seized vast territories in the west and the north-west (including the major city of Tabriz) and the Uzbeks had overrun half of Khorasan in the north-east. Iran itself was riven by fighting between the various factions of the Qizilbash, who had mocked royal authority by killing the queen in 1579 and the grand vizier Mirza Salman Jabiri in 1583.
Firstly, Abbas settled his score with his mother&#x27;s killers, executing three of the ringleaders of the plot and exiling four others. His next task was to free himself from the power of Murshid Qoli Khan. Murshid made Abbas marry Hamza&#x27;s widow and a Safavid cousin, and began distributing important government posts among his own friends, gradually confining Abbas to the palace. Meanwhile, the Uzbeks continued their conquest of Khorasan. When Abbas heard they were besieging his old friend Ali Qoli Khan Shamlu in Herat, he pleaded with Murshid to take action. Fearing a rival, Murshid did nothing until the news came that Herat had fallen and the Uzbeks had slaughtered the entire population. Only then did he set out on campaign to Khorasan. But Abbas planned to avenge the death of Ali Qoli Khan, and he arranged for four Qizilbash leaders to kill Murshid after a banquet on 23 July 1589. With Murshid gone, Abbas could now rule Iran in his own right.

Abbas decided he must re-establish order within Iran before he took on the foreign invaders. To this end he made a humiliating peace treaty, known as the Treaty of Istanbul, with the Ottomans in 1590, ceding to them the provinces of Azerbaijan, Karabagh, Ganja, Dagestan and Qarajadagh, as well as parts of Georgia, Luristan and Kurdistan. This demeaning treaty even ceded the previous capital of Tabriz to the Ottomans.

===Reducing the Qizilbash&#x27;s power and Caucasus invasions===

The Qizilbash had provided the backbone of the Safavid army from the very beginning of Safavid rule and they also occupied many posts in the government. As a result, effective power in the state in the early days of the dynasty was held by the Qizilbash, leaving the shah often powerless. To counterbalance their power and as a decisive answer to this problem, Abbas turned to the newly introduced members of Iranian society (an initiative put in place by Shah Tahmasp I) the &quot;ghulams&quot; (a word literally meaning &quot;slaves&quot;). From these newly introduced slaves, the Shah created a military force of up to 37,000 soldiers, completely funded by the Crown. This weakened the power that the Qizilbash had against the crown significantly as they no longer had a &quot;military monopoly&quot; in Iran. Like the janissaries of the neighbouring Ottoman Empire, the &quot;ghulams&quot; were mainly Georgians, Circassians and Armenians who had been brought into Iran &quot;en masse&quot; (by conquest and slave trade), had converted or had been converted to Islam, and had taken up service in the army, royal household or the civil administration, and were loyal only to the shah. Under Abbas&#x27; leadership this new grouping in Iranian society (also called the &quot;third force&quot;) grew in influence and power, with many thousands of ethnic Georgians, Circassians and Armenians becoming an integral part of Iranian society and taking up key government, royal household and military positions.

Tahmasp I, the second Safavid shah, had realised, by looking at his own empire and that of the neighbouring Ottomans, that he faced ongoing threats from dangerous rival factions and internal family rivalries that were a threat to him as the head of state. If not properly managed, these rivalries represented a serious threat to the ruler or could lead to unnecessary court intrigues. For Tahmasp, the problem revolved around the military tribal elite of the empire, the Qizilbash, who believed that physical proximity to and control of a member of the immediate Safavid family guaranteed spiritual advantages, political fortune and material advancement.

Therefore, between 1540 and 1555, Tahmasp conducted a series of invasions of the Caucasus region which provided battle experience for his soldiers, as well as leading to the capture of large numbers of Christian Circassian and Georgian slaves (30,000 in just four raids). These slaves would form the basis of a Safavid military slave system. These slaves would serve a similar role in their formation, implementation and use to the janissaries of the neighbouring Ottoman Empire. Their arrival in such large numbers led to the formation of a new grouping in Iranian society solely composed of ethnic Caucasians. Although the first slave soldiers would not be organised until Abbas&#x27; reign, during Tahmasp&#x27;s time Caucasians would already become important members of the royal household, the harem and in the civil and military administration.
Learning from his grandfather, Abbas (who had been used by the vying Qizilbash factions during his youth) decided to encourage this new (Caucasian) grouping in Iranian society, as he realised that he must impose his authority on the Qezelbāš or remain their puppet. So Abbas single-handedly encouraged the growth in influence and power of this new grouping, also called the &quot;third force&quot;. It is estimated that during Abbas&#x27; reign alone some 130,000 to 200,000 Georgians, tens of thousands of Circassians, and around 300,000 Armenians were deported from the Caucasus to Persia&#x27;s heartland, with a significant number gaining responsibilities and roles in Iranian society, including some of the highest positions of the state, including the &quot;ghulam&quot; corps. Many of those deported from the Caucasus settled in various regions of Iran and became craftsmen, farmers, cattle breeders, traders, soldiers, generals, governors and peasants within Iranian society. As part of the ghulam slave system, Abbas greatly expanded the ghulam military corps (also known as &quot;ḡolāmān-e ḵāṣṣa-ye-e šarifa&quot;, &quot;crown servants&quot;) from just a few hundred during Tahmasp&#x27;s era, to 15,000 highly trained cavalrymen, as part of a whole army division of 40,000 Caucasian ghulams. Abbas then reduced the number of Qizilbash provincial governorships and systematically moved Qizilbash governors to other districts, thus disrupting their ties with the local community and reducing their power. Most were eventually replaced by ghulams, whose loyalty was to the shah.

By 1595, Allahverdi Khan, a Georgian, had become one of the most powerful men in the Safavid state when he was appointed the Governor-General of Fars, one of the richest provinces in Persia. His power reached its peak in 1598, when he became the commander-in-chief of all the armed forces. Not only did the ghulam system allow the shah to control and manage the rival Qizilbash Turks and Persians, it also resolved budgetary problems, in the short term at least, for by restoring the Shah&#x27;s complete control of the provinces formerly governed by the Qizilbash chiefs, the provinces&#x27; revenues now supplemented the royal treasury. From now on, government officials collected the taxes and remitted them directly to the royal treasury. In the harem, the Circassians and Georgians rapidly replaced the Turcoman factions and, as a result, gained a significant direct influence on the meritocratic Safavid bureaucracy and the court of the Safavid state.

The increasing numbers of Georgians and Circassians in the Safavid bureaucracy and the court of the Safavid state vied with the Qizilbash for power and as a result also became involved in court intrigues. This competition for influence saw queens (and their supporters in the harem, court and bureaucracy) compete against each other in order to get their own sons on the throne. This competition increased under Abbas and his successors which weakened the dynasty considerably. Abbas&#x27; own son and crown prince, Mohammad Baqer Mirza, was caught in the court intrigue involving several leading Circassians, which eventually led to him being executed under Abbas&#x27; orders.

Though the &quot;ghulam&quot; system did not work as well as it had after the Safavids, the &quot;third force&quot; would continue to play a crucial role during the rest of the Safavid era and later until the fall of the Qajar dynasty.

===Reforming the army===

Abbas needed ten years to get his army into shape so that he could effectively confront his Ottoman and Uzbek enemies. During this period, the Uzbeks and the Ottomans took swaths of territory from Iran. He also used military reorganisation as another way of side-lining the Qizilbash. He created a standing army of many thousands of &quot;ghulams&quot; (always conscripted from ethnic Georgians and Circassians), and to a much lesser extent Iranians, to fight alongside the traditional, feudal force provided by the Qizilbash. The new army regiments&#x27; loyalty was to the Shah. The new army consisted of 10,000 to 15,000 cavalry or squires (conscripted Caucasian &quot;ghulams&quot;) armed with muskets and other weapons (then the largest cavalry in the world), a corps of musketeers, or &quot;tufangchiyan&quot;, (12,000 strong) and a corp of artillery, called &quot;tupchiyan&quot; (also 12,000 strong). In addition Abbas had a personal bodyguard, composed of Caucasian ghulams, that was increased to 3,000. This force amounted to about 40,000 soldiers paid for and beholden to the Shah.

Abbas greatly increased the number of cannon at his disposal so that he could field 500 cannon in a single battle. Ruthless discipline was enforced and looting was severely punished. Abbas was also able to draw on military advice from a number of European envoys, particularly the English adventurers Sir Anthony Shirley and his brother Robert Shirley, who arrived in 1598 as envoys from the Earl of Essex on an unofficial mission to persuade Persia to enter into an anti-Ottoman alliance.

From 1600 onwards, the Safavid statesman Allāhverdī Khan, in conjunction with Robert Shirley, undertook further reorganizations of the army, which led to a further increase in the number of &quot;ghulams&quot; to 25,000.

===Consolidation of the Empire===
During the 1590s, Abbas moved to depose the provincial rulers of Persia. He started with Khan Ahmad Khan, the ruler of Gilan, who had disobeyed Abbas&#x27; orders when he requested that Khan Ahmad Khan&#x27;s daughter Yakhan Begum marry Abbas&#x27; son, Mohammad Baqer Mirza, since Khan Ahmad Khan had no male successor. Khan Ahmad Khan disagreed due to the age of his daughter. This resulted in a Safavid invasion of Gilan in 1591 under the leadership of one of Abbas&#x27; favourites, Farhad Khan Qaramanlu. In 1593–94, Jahangir III, the Paduspanid ruler of Nur, travelled to the court of the Abbas, where he handed over his domains to him, and spend the rest of his life on an estate at Saveh, which Abbas had given to him. In 1597, Abbas deposed the Khorshidi ruler of Luristan. One year later, Jahangir IV, the Paduspanid ruler of Kojur, killed two prominent Safavid nobles during a festival in Qazvin. In response, in 1598 Abbas invaded his domains and besieged Kojur. Jahangir managed to flee, but was captured and killed by a pro-Safavid Paduspanid named Hasan Lavasani.

==Reconquest==
===War against the Khanate of Bukhara===
Abbas&#x27; first campaign with his reformed army was against the Uzbeks who had seized Khorasan and were ravaging the province. In April 1598 he went on the attack. One of the two main cities of the province, Mashhad, was easily recaptured but the Uzbek leader Din Mohammed Khan was safely behind the walls of the other chief city, Herat. Abbas managed to lure the Uzbek army out of the town by feigning a retreat. A bloody battle ensued on 9 August 1598, in the course of which the Uzbek khan was wounded and his troops retreated (the khan was murdered by his own men during the retreat). However, during the battle, Farhad Khan had fled after being wounded and was later accused of fleeing due to cowardice. He was nevertheless forgiven by Abbas, who wanted to appoint him as the governor of Herat, which Farhad Khan refused. According to Oruch Beg, Farhad Khan&#x27;s refusal made Abbas feel that he had been insulted. Due to Farhad Khan&#x27;s arrogant behaviour and his suspected treason, he was seen as a threat to Abbas, so Abbas had him executed. Abbas then converted Gilan and Mazandaran into the crown domain (&quot;khasseh&quot;), and appointed Allahverdi Khan as the new commander-in-chief of the Safavid army.

By 1599, Abbas had captured not only Herat and Mashhad, but had moved as far east as Balkh. This was a short-lived victory and he could only settle on controlling only some of this conquest, because the new ruler of the Transoxiana, Baqi Muhammad Khan returned Balkh to Uzbek domain after defeating Safavid army led by Abbas near Balkh in 1602. By 1603, the battle lines had stabilized despite the loss of the majority of the Safavid artillery to Uzbeks. Abbas was able to hold onto most of Khorasan, including Herat, Sabzevar, Farah, and Nisa.

Abbas&#x27; north-east frontier was now safe for the time being and he could turn his attention to the Ottomans in the west. After defeating the Uzbeks, he moved his capital from Qazvin to Isfahan.

===War against the Ottomans===
The Safavids had not yet beaten their archrival, the Ottomans, in battle. After a particularly arrogant series of demands from the Ottoman ambassador, the Shah had him seized, had his beard shaved and sent it to his master, the sultan, in Constantinople. This was effectively a declaration of war. In the resulting conflict, Abbas first recaptured Nahavand and destroyed the fortress in the city, which the Ottomans had planned to use as an advance base for attacks on Iran. The next year, Abbas pretended he was setting off on a hunting expedition to Mazandaran with his men. This was merely a ruse to deceive the Ottoman spies in his court – his real target was Azerbaijan. He changed course for Qazvin where he assembled a large army and set off to retake Tabriz, which had been in Ottoman hands for some time.
For the first time, the Iranians made great use of their artillery and the town – which had been ruined by Ottoman occupation – soon fell. Abbas set off to besiege Yerevan, a town that had become one of the main Ottoman strongholds in the Caucasus since the Safavids had ceded it in 1590. It finally fell in June 1604 and with it the Ottomans lost the support of most Armenians, Georgians and other Caucasians. But Abbas was unsure how the new Sultan Ahmed I, would respond and withdrew from the region using scorched earth tactics. For a year, neither side made a move, but in 1605, Abbas sent his general Allahverdi Khan to meet Ottoman forces on the shores of Lake Van. On 6 November 1605 the Iranians, led by Abbas, scored a decisive victory over the Ottomans at Sufiyan, near Tabriz. In the Caucasus, during the war Abbas also managed to capture what is now Kabardino-Balkaria. The Persian victory was recognised in the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha in 1612, effectively granting them back suzerainty over most of the Caucasus.

Several years of peace followed as the Ottomans carefully planned their response. But their secret training manoeuvres were observed by Iranian spies. Abbas learnt that the Ottoman plan was to invade Iran via Azerbaijan, take Tabriz then move on to Ardabil and Qazvin, which they could use as bargaining chips in exchange for other territories. The shah decided to lay a trap. He would allow the Ottomans to enter the country, then destroy them. He had Tabriz evacuated of its inhabitants while he waited at Ardabil with his army. In 1618, an Ottoman army of 100,000 led by the Grand Vizier Damat Halil Pasha invaded and easily seized Tabriz. The vizier sent an ambassador to the shah demanding he make peace and return the lands taken since 1602. Abbas refused and pretended he was ready to set fire to Ardabil and retreat further inland rather than face the Ottoman army. When Halil Pasha heard the news, he decided to march on Ardabil right away. This was just what Abbas wanted. His army of 40,000 was hiding at a crossroads on the way and they ambushed the Ottoman army in a battle, which ended in complete victory for the Iranians.

In 1623, Abbas decided to take back Mesopotamia, which had been lost by his grandfather Tahmasp through the Ottoman-Safavid War (1532–1555). Profiting from the confusion surrounding the accession of the new Ottoman Sultan Murad IV, he pretended to be making a pilgrimage to the Shi&#x27;ite shrines of Kerbala and Najaf, but used his army to seize Baghdad. However, Abbas was then distracted by a rebellion in Georgia in 1624 led by Giorgi Saakadze thus allowing an Ottoman force to besiege Baghdad, but the Shah came to its relief the next year and defeated the Turkish army decisively. In 1638, however, after Abbas&#x27; death, the Ottomans retook Baghdad, and the Iranian–Ottoman border was finalised to be roughly the same as the current Iran–Turkey and Iran–Iraq borders.

===Quelling the Georgian uprisings===

Between 1614 and 1616, during the Ottoman–Safavid War, Abbas suppressed a rebellion led by his formerly loyal Georgian subjects Luarsab II and Teimuraz I (also known as &quot;Tahmuras Khan&quot;) in the Kingdom of Kakheti.

In 1606, Abbas had appointed these Georgians onto the thrones of Safavid vassals Kartli and Kakheti, at the behest of Kartlian nobles and Teimuraz&#x27;s mother Ketevan; both seemed like malleable youths. However, tensions soon arose between the Shah and the Georgian kings. In 1613, when the Shah summoned them to join him on a hunting expedition in Mazandaran, they did not appear as they feared that they would be either imprisoned or killed. At this point war broke out, Iranian armies invaded the two territories in March 1614, and the two allied kings subsequently sought refuge in the Ottoman vassal Imeretia. Abbas, as reported by the Safavid court historian Iskander Beg Munshi, was infuriated by what was perceived as the defection of two of his most trusted subjects and &quot;gholams&quot;. He deported 30,000 Kakhetian peasants to Iran, and appointed a grandson of Alexander II of Imereti to the throne of Kartli, Jesse of Kakheti (also known as &quot;Isā Khān&quot;). Raised up at the court in Isfahan and a Muslim, he was perceived as fully loyal to the Shah.

Abbas threatened Imeretia with devastation if they did not give up the fugitive kings; the Imeretian, Mingrelian and Gurian rulers jointly refused his demand. Luarsab, however, surrendered voluntarily to the Shah; Abbas initially treated him well but when he learned that Luarsab and Teimuraz had offered an alliance with the Ottomans he demanded that Luarsab accept Islam. When Luarsab refused, he was thrown in prison.

Teimuraz returned to eastern Georgia in 1615, taking advantage of a resurgence in Ottoman–Safavid hostilities, and there he defeated a Safavid force. However, when the Ottoman army postponed its invasion of the Safavids, Abbas was able to briefly send an army back to defeat Teimuraz, and redoubled his invasion after brokering a truce with the Ottomans. Now Iranian rule was fully restored over eastern Georgia. In a punitive expedition to Kakhetia, his army then killed perhaps 60,000–70,000 or 100,000 Georgians, with twice as many more being deported to Iran, removing about two-thirds of the Kakhetian population. More refugees were rounded up in 1617. In 1619 Abbas appointed the loyal Simon II (or &quot;Semayun Khan&quot;) as a puppet ruler of Kakheti, while placing a series of his own governors to rule over districts where the rebellious inhabitants were mostly located.

Having momentarily secured the region, Abbas took further acts of revenge for the recalcitrance of Teimuraz and Luarsab. He castrated Teimuraz&#x27;s sons, who both died shortly afterwards. He executed Luarsab in 1622, and in 1624 he had Ketevan, who had been sent to the Shah as a negotiator, tortured to death when she refused to renounce Christianity. Teimuraz, meanwhile, sought aid from the Ottomans and Russia.

Abbas was then warned of another imminent Kakhetian uprising, so he returned to Georgia in early 1625. He lured Kakhetian soldiers on a false pretext and then began executing them. He also had plans to execute all armed Kartlians, including his own general Giorgi Saakadze; however Saakadze intercepted a courier and uncovered the plot. Saakadze then defected to the Georgians, and led a new rebellion which succeeded in throwing the Persians out of Kartli and Kakheti while crowning Teimuraz as king of both territories. Abbas counterattacked in June, won the subsequent war and dethroned Teimuraz, but lost half his army at the hands of the Georgians and was forced to accept Kartli and Kakheti only as vassal states while abandoning his plans to eliminate Christians from the area.

Even then, Saakadze and Teimuraz launched another rebellion in 1626, and were effective in clearing Iranian forces from most of the region. Thus, the Georgian territories continued to resist Safavid encroachments until Abbas&#x27; death.

===Kandahar and the Mughals===
The Safavids were traditionally allied with the Mughals in India against the Uzbeks, who coveted the province of Khorasan. The Mughal emperor Humayun had given Abbas&#x27; grandfather, Shah Tahmasp, the province of Kandahar as a reward for helping him regain his throne. In 1590, profiting from the confusion in Iran, Humayun&#x27;s successor Akbar seized Kandahar. Abbas continued to maintain cordial relations with the Mughals, even though he pursued the return of Kandahar. Finally, in 1620, a diplomatic incident, in which the Iranian ambassador refused to bow down in front of the Emperor Jahangir, led to war. India was embroiled in civil turmoil and Abbas realized that he needed just a lightning raid to take back the far easternmost town of Kandahar in 1622.

After the conquest, he was very conciliatory to Jahangir, claiming he had only taken back what was rightly his and disavowing any further territorial ambitions. Jahangir was not appeased but he was unable to recapture the province. A childhood friend of Abbas, named Ganj Ali Khan, was then appointed as the governor of the city, which he would govern until his death in 1624/5.

===War against the Portuguese===

During the 16th century, the Portuguese had established bases in the Persian Gulf. In 1602, the Iranian army under the command of Imam Quli Khan Undiladze managed to expel the Portuguese from Bahrain. In 1622, with the help of four English ships, Abbas retook Hormuz from the Portuguese. He replaced it as a trading centre with a new port, Bandar Abbas, nearby on the mainland, but it never became successful.

==Shah and his subjects==

===Isfahan: a new capital===
Abbas moved his capital from Qazvin to the more central city of Isfahan in 1598. Embellished by a magnificent series of new mosques, baths, colleges, and caravansarais, Isfahan became one of the most beautiful cities in the world. As Roger Savory writes, &quot;Not since the development of Baghdad in the eighth century A.D. by the Caliph al-Mansur had there been such a comprehensive example of town-planning in the Islamic world, and the scope and layout of the city centre clearly reflect its status as the capital of an empire.&quot; Isfahan became the centre of Safavid architectural achievement, with the mosques Masjed-e Shah and the Masjed-e Sheykh Lotfollah and other monuments including the Ali Qapu, the Chehel Sotoun palace and the Naghsh-i Jahan Square.

In making Isfahan the centre of the Safavid Empire, Abbas utilized the Armenians, whom he had forcibly relocated to Isfahan from their homeland in the Armenian highlands. Once they were settled, he allowed them considerable freedom and encouraged them to continue in their silk trade. Silk was an integral part of the economy and considered to be the best form of hard currency available. The Armenians had already established trade networks that allowed Abbas to strengthen Iran&#x27;s economy.

===Arts===
Abbas&#x27; painting studios (of the Isfahan school established under his patronage) created some of the finest art in modern Iranian history, by such illustrious painters as Reza Abbasi and Muhammad Qasim. Despite the ascetic roots of the Ṣafavid dynasty and the religious injunctions restricting the pleasures lawful to the faithful, the art of Abbas&#x27; time denoted a certain relaxation of the strictures. The portrait by Muhammad Qasim suggests that the Muslim prohibition against the consumption of wine, as well as that against male intimacy, &quot;were more honoured in the breach than in the observance&quot;. Abbas brought in 300 Chinese potters to Iran to enhance local production of Chinese-style ceramics.

Under Abbas&#x27; reign, carpet weaving increased its role as an important part of Persian industry and culture, as wealthy Europeans started importing Persian rugs. Silk production became a monopoly of the crown, and manuscripts, bookbinding, and ceramics were also important exports.

===Attitude towards religious minorities===
Like almost all other Safavid monarchs, Abbas was a Shi&#x27;ite Muslim. He had a particular veneration for Imam Hussein. In 1601, he made a pilgrimage on foot from Isfahan to Mashhad, site of the shrine of Imam Reza, which he restored (it had been despoiled by the Uzbeks). Since Sunni Islam was the religion of Iran&#x27;s main rival, the Ottoman Empire, Abbas often treated Sunnis living in western border provinces harshly.

Abbas was usually tolerant of Christianity. The Italian traveller Pietro della Valle was astonished at the Shah&#x27;s knowledge of Christian history and theology and establishing diplomatic links with European Christian states was a vital part of the shah&#x27;s foreign policy. Christian Armenia was a key Safavid province bordering the Ottoman Empire. From 1604 Abbas implemented a &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy in the region to protect his north-western frontier against any invading Ottoman forces, a policy that involved the forced resettlement of up to 300,000 Armenians from their homelands. The Armenians came primarily from the wealthy Armenian merchant town of Jugha (also known as Jolfa). Many were transferred to New Julfa, a town the shah had built for the Armenians primarily meant for these Armenians from Jugha (&quot;Old Julfa&quot;), near his capital Isfahan. Thousands of Armenians died on the journey. Those who survived enjoyed considerable religious freedom in New Julfa, where the shah built them a new cathedral. Abbas&#x27; aim was to boost the Iranian economy by encouraging the Armenian merchants who had moved to New Julfa. As well as religious liberties, he also offered them interest-free loans and allowed the town to elect its own mayor (&quot;kalantar&quot;). Other Armenians were transferred to the provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran. These were less lucky. Abbas wanted to establish a second capital in Mazandaran, Farahabad, but the climate was unhealthy and malarial. Many settlers died and others gradually abandoned the city.

Abbas was more intolerant of Christians in Georgia, where the threat of rebellion loomed larger. Abbas frequently demanded that nobles convert to Shia Islam, and had Ketevan the Martyr tortured to death when she refused. Abbas&#x27;s anger at Georgian rebelliousness also generated his plan to deport or exterminate eastern Georgia&#x27;s Christians and replace them with Turkmens, which has been described as &quot;genocidal&quot;.

==Contacts with Europe==
Abbas&#x27; tolerance towards most Christians was part of his policy of establishing diplomatic links with European powers to try to enlist their help in the fight against their common enemy, the Ottoman Empire. The idea of such an anti-Ottoman alliance was not a new one – over a century before, Uzun Hassan, then ruler of part of Iran, had asked the Venetians for military aid – but none of the Safavids had made diplomatic overtures to Europe and Abbas&#x27; attitude was in marked contrast to that of his grandfather, Tahmasp I, who had expelled the English traveller Anthony Jenkinson from his court upon hearing he was a Christian. For his part, Abbas declared that he &quot;preferred the dust from the shoe soles of the lowest Christian to the highest Ottoman personage&quot;.

In 1599, Abbas sent his first diplomatic mission to Europe. The group crossed the Caspian Sea and spent the winter in Moscow, before proceeding through Norway, Germany (where it was received by Emperor Rudolf II) to Rome where Pope Clement VIII gave the travellers a long audience. They finally arrived at the court of Philip III of Spain in 1602. Although the expedition never managed to return to Iran, being shipwrecked on the journey around Africa, it marked an important new step in contacts between Iran and Europe and Europeans began to be fascinated by the Iranians and their culture – Shakespeare&#x27;s 1601–02 &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, for example, makes two references (at II.5 and III.4) to &#x27;the Sophy&#x27;, then the English term for the Shahs of Iran. Persian fashions—such as shoes with heels, for men—were enthusiastically adopted by European aristocrats. Henceforward, the number of diplomatic missions to and from Persia greatly increased.

The shah had set great store on an alliance with Spain, the chief opponent of the Ottomans in Europe. Abbas offered trading rights and the chance to preach Christianity in Iran in return for help against the Ottomans. But the stumbling block of Hormuz remained, a port that had fallen into Spanish hands when the King of Spain inherited the throne of Portugal in 1580. The Spanish demanded Abbas break off relations with the English East India Company before they would consider relinquishing the town. Abbas was unable to comply. Eventually Abbas became frustrated with Spain, as he did with the Holy Roman Empire, which wanted him to make his 400,000+ Armenian subjects swear allegiance to the Pope but did not trouble to inform the shah when the Emperor Rudolf signed a peace treaty with the Ottomans. Contacts with the Pope, Poland and Muscovy were no more fruitful.

More came of Abbas&#x27; contacts with the English, although England had little interest in fighting against the Ottomans. The Shirley brothers arrived in 1598 and helped reorganise the Iranian army, which proved to be pivotal for the Safavid victory in the Ottoman-Safavid War (1603–1618) and the first Safavid victory in battle over their neighbouring Ottoman archrivals. One of the Shirley brothers, Robert Shirley, led Abbas&#x27; second diplomatic mission to Europe between 1609 and 1615. The English East India Company also began to take an interest in Iran and in 1622 four of its ships helped Abbas retake Hormuz from the Portuguese. The capture of Ormuz gave the opportunity for the Company to develop trade with Persia, attempting to trade English cloth and other commodities for silk, with did not become very profitable due to the lack of Persian interest and small quantity of English goods.

==Family tragedies and death==
Of Abbas&#x27; five sons, three had survived past childhood, so the Safavid succession seemed secure. He was on good terms with the crown prince, Mohammed Baqir Mirza (born 1587; better known in the West as Safi Mirza). In 1614, however, during a campaign in Georgia, the shah heard rumours that the prince was conspiring against him with a leading Circassian, Farhad Beg Cherkes. Shortly after, Mohammed Baqir broke protocol during a hunt by killing a boar before the shah had a chance to put his spear in the animal. This seemed to confirm Abbas&#x27; suspicions and he sunk into melancholy; he no longer trusted any of his three sons. In 1615, he decided he had no choice but to have Mohammed killed. A Circassian named Behbud Beg executed the Shah&#x27;s orders and the prince was murdered in a hammam in the city of Resht. The shah almost immediately regretted his action and was plunged into grief.

In 1621, Abbas fell seriously ill. His heir, Mohammed Khodabanda, thought he was on his deathbed and began to celebrate his accession to the throne with his Qizilbash supporters. But the shah recovered and punished his son by blinding him, which would disqualify him from ever taking the throne. The blinding was only partially successful and the prince&#x27;s followers planned to smuggle him out of the country to safety with the Mughals whose aid they would use to overthrow Abbas and install Mohammed on the throne. But the plot was betrayed, the prince&#x27;s followers were executed and the prince himself imprisoned in the fortress of Alamut where he would later be murdered by Abbas&#x27; successor, Shah Safi.

Imam Qoli Mirza, the third and last son, then became the crown prince. Abbas groomed him carefully for the throne but, for some reason, in 1627, he had him partially blinded and imprisoned in Alamut.

Unexpectedly, Abbas now chose as heir the son of Mohammed Baqir Mirza, Sam Mirza, a cruel and introverted character who was said to loathe his grandfather because of his father&#x27;s murder. Nevertheless, he did succeed Shah Abbas at the age of 17 in 1629, taking the name Shah Safi. Abbas&#x27;s health was poor from 1621 onwards. He died at his palace in Farahabad on the Caspian coast in 1629 and was buried in Kashan.

==Character and legacy==

Abbas projected great military power, regained most of the lands lost by his predecessors, and adopted a set of forward-looking policies designed to optimise military strength, centralise state control, and expand Iran’s internal and international commercial scope. He paired ruthlessness with justice and dealt harshly with threats to his power, while remaining in touch with his people. These qualities ultimately led to his being styled Abbas the Great.

Abbas I is generally considered one of the greatest rulers of Iranian history and the Safavid dynasty. According to Roger Savory: &quot;Shah Abbas I possessed in abundance qualities which entitle him to be styled &#x27;the Great&#x27;. He was a brilliant strategist and tactician whose chief characteristic was prudence. He preferred to obtain his ends by diplomacy rather than war, and showed immense patience in pursuing his objectives.&quot; In Michael Axworthy&#x27;s view, Abbas &quot;was a talented administrator and military leader, and a ruthless autocrat. His reign was the outstanding creative period of the Safavid era. But the civil wars and troubles of his childhood (when many of his relatives were murdered) left him with a dark twist of suspicion and brutality at the centre of his personality.&quot; Donald Rayfield described him as &quot;exceptionally perspicacious and active,&quot; but also &quot;a murderous paranoiac when aroused.&quot;

&quot;The Cambridge History of Iran&quot; rejects the view that the death of Abbas marked the beginning of the decline of the Safavid dynasty as Iran continued to prosper throughout the 17th century, but blames him for the poor statesmanship of the later Safavid shahs: &quot;The elimination of royal princes, whether by blinding or immuring them in the harem, their exclusion from the affairs of state and from contact with the leading aristocracy of the empire and the generals, all the abuses of the princes&#x27; education, which were nothing new but which became the normal practice with Abbas at the court of Isfahan, effectively put a stop to the training of competent successors, that is to say, efficient princes prepared to meet the demands of ruling as kings.&quot;

Abbas was fluent in the Turkic dialect used by the Turkoman portion of the multi-ethnic Qizilbash organization, although he was equally at ease speaking Persian, which was the language of the administration and culture, of the majority of the population, as well as of the court when Isfahan became the capital under his reign (1598). According to García de Silva Figueroa, the Spanish ambassador to the Safavid court during Abbas&#x27; later reign, he heard Abbas speak Georgian, which he had doubtlessly acquired from his Georgian &quot;gholams&quot; and concubines.

Abbas gained strong support from the common people. Sources report him spending much of his time among them, personally visiting bazaars and other public places in Isfahan. Short in stature but physically strong until his health declined in his final years, Abbas could go for long periods without needing to sleep or eat and could ride great distances. At the age of nineteen, Abbas shaved off his beard, keeping only his moustache, thus setting a fashion in Iran.

Abbas was also a charismatic orator who could persuade and influence people with his eloquence. Classic Turkmen poet Magtymguly, who lived a century after Abbas, mentioned him in the poem (Not a jewel) with the following verses:
:
:There are many who&#x27;d say they are good orators,
:Though nobody is as eloquent as Shah Abbas.

<text>The Treskilling Yellow, or three schilling banco error of color (, literally &quot;yellow three skilling banco&quot;), is a Swedish postage stamp of which only one example is known to exist. This stamp was cancelled at Nya Kopparberget (now known as Kopparberg), about from Uppsala, on July 13, 1857. It was last sold in 2010. The auction house valued the stamp between £1.29 million and £1.73 million before the sale. The winning bid was kept confidential.

==History==
In 1855, Sweden issued its first postage stamps, in a set of five values depicting the Swedish coat of arms, with denominations ranging from three to 24 Swedish skillings. The three-skilling stamp was normally printed in a blue-green color, with the eight-skilling stamp being printed in yellowish orange. It is not known exactly what went wrong, but the most likely explanation is that a stereotype of the eight-skilling printing plate (which consisted of 100 stereotypes assembled into a 10 × 10 array) was damaged or broken, and it was mistakenly replaced with a three-skilling. The number of stamps printed in the wrong color is unknown, but so far only one example has been found.

Somehow, this error went entirely unnoticed at the time, and by 1858 the Swedish currency was changed. The skilling stamps were replaced by new stamps denominated in &quot;öre&quot;. In 1886, a young collector named Georg Wilhelm Backman was going through covers in his grandmother&#x27;s attic at the farm Väster Munga Gård north of Västerås, and came across one with a three-skilling stamp, for which the Stockholm stamp dealer Heinrich Lichtenstein was offering seven kronor apiece.
After it had changed hands several times, Sigmund Friedl sold it to Philipp von Ferrary in 1894, who had at that time the largest known stamp collection in the world, and paid the sum of 4,000 florins. As time passed, and no other &quot;yellows&quot; surfaced despite thorough searching, it became clear that the stamp was not only rare, but quite possibly the only surviving example.

When Ferrary&#x27;s collection was auctioned in the 1920s, Swedish Baron Eric Leijonhufvud bought the yellow stamp, and then Claes A. Tamm bought it in 1926 for £1,500 sterling in order to complete his collection of Swedish stamps. In 1928, the stamp was sold to the lawyer Johan Ramberg for £2,000, and he kept it for nine years. In 1937, King Carol II of Romania purchased it from London auction house H. R. Harmer for £5,000, and in 1950 it went to Rene Berlingen for an unknown amount of money.

In the 1970s, the Swedish Postal Museum caused a controversy by declaring the stamp to be a forgery, but after examinations by two different commissions, it was agreed that this was a genuine stamp.

In 1984, the yellow stamp made headlines when it was sold by David Feldman for 977,500 Swiss francs. It was resold in 1990 for over $1,000,000. Then, in 1996 it sold again for 2,880,000 Swiss francs. Each successive sale was a world record price for a postage stamp.

On 22 May 2010, the yellow stamp was auctioned once again by David Feldman in Geneva, Switzerland. It sold &quot;for at least the $2.3 million price [that] it set a record for in 1996&quot;. The buyer reportedly was an &quot;international consortium&quot; and the seller was a financial firm auctioning the stamp to pay the former owner&#x27;s debt. The exact price and the identity of the buyer were not disclosed and all bidders reportedly were sworn to secrecy; however, the auctioneer stated that it was &quot;still worth more than any other single stamp.&quot; The buyer has subsequently been identified as Armand Rousso, &quot;a colorful philatelic player ... known ... for a number of high-profile activities.&quot;

In May 2013, the stamp was acquired in a private sale by Count Gustaf Douglas, a Swedish nobleman and politician.

==Jean-Claude Andre&#x27;s lawsuit==
In or before 2012, Jean-Claude Andre and his wife Jane Andre brought a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, London, against Clydesdale Bank PLC, claiming that he had stored a locked trunk at the bank in which there allegedly were six covers bearing a total of nine Treskilling Yellow stamps, along with other less valuable items. Andre claimed that he had left the trunk undisturbed from 1986 to 2004, but when he sought to retrieve it the lock had been removed and the covers and stamps taken. Philatelic dealer David Feldman testified that the covers would have been worth some 3.7 million pounds sterling. After a lengthy trial, the court issued a judgment dated 31 January – 1 February 2013, in which it rejected Andre&#x27;s claim, finding him and his wife unreliable witnesses and their claim suffering from &quot;sheer inherent implausibility&quot;.

==In popular culture==

In the 1954 Agatha Christie mystery play &quot;Spider&#x27;s Web&quot;, a similar &quot;Swedish yellow&quot; error stamp is the item used by a character as motivation for murder, pointing out that it&#x27;s valued at over £14,000 (over £323,000 in 2024).

In the 1964 movie &quot;Charade&quot;, a stamp based on the Treskilling Yellow—an Fyraskilling Orange—is one of three rare stamps used by a main character to hide a large amount of money in plain sight.

In episode 2 &quot;Return to Sender&quot; of season 6 of &quot;White Collar&quot;, Neal Caffrey has to steal the Treskilling Yellow as part of a heist planned by an exclusive group of thieves, The Pink Panthers. The stamp is shown in high detail as Caffrey forges a copy.

In episode 16 &quot;Dial M For Merger&quot; of &quot;Total Drama Action&quot;, Harold claims that there aren’t enough Treskilling Yellows in the world that would make him work with Duncan, a character who frequently teased him on the show. On the same episode, Harold also said that if he had the stamp, he wouldn’t agree to be on the show.

<doc id="299832" wikidata="Q3606521" url="?curid=299832" title="Detachable chairlift">
<text>A detachable chairlift or high-speed chairlift is a type of passenger aerial lift, which, like a fixed-grip chairlift, consists of numerous chairs attached to a constantly moving wire rope (called a &quot;haul rope&quot;) that is strung between two (or more) terminals over intermediate towers. In contrast to the fixed-grip version, the chairs of a detachable chair lift detach from the haul rope for loading and unloading.

The significance of &quot;detachable&quot; chairlift technology is primarily the speed and capacity. Detachable chairlifts move far faster than their fixed-grip brethren, averaging 1,000 feet per minute (11.3 mph, 18 km/h, 5.08 m/s) versus a typical fixed-grip speed of 500 ft/min (5.6 mph, 9 km/h, 2.54 m/s). Because the cable moves faster than most passengers could safely disembark and load, each chair is connected to the cable by a powerful spring-loaded cable grip which detaches at terminals, allowing the chair to slow considerably for convenient loading and unloading at a typical speed of 200 ft/min (2 mph, 4 km/h, 1 m/s), a speed even slower than fixed-grip chairlifts.

They are now commonplace at all but the smallest of ski resorts. Some are installed at tourist attractions as well as for urban transportation.

Another advantage of detaching chairs is the ability to remove chairs during severe weather in order to reduce stress on the rope and towers. Furthermore, operating the unladen rope during extreme weather is effective at preventing—or greatly reducing—ice and snow accumulation on the sheaves and rope. This saves considerable time, expense and hazard when opening the chair for operation, which would otherwise require workers to climb each tower and chip away ice and shovel snow.

Chairlifts are made in a variety of sizes, carrying from 1 to 8 passengers. All chairs on a given chairlift usually have the same capacity. Slang terms for the different sizes include &quot;single&quot;, &quot;double&quot;, &quot;triple&quot;, &quot;quad&quot;, &quot;six pack&quot;, and &quot;eight&quot;. Detachable chairlifts may also be described as &quot;high speed&quot; or &quot;express&quot;, which results in terms such as &quot;high speed six pack&quot; and &quot;express quad&quot;.

Some detachable chairlifts have so-called &quot;bubble chairs&quot;, which add a retractable acrylic glass dome to protect passengers from weather.

An alternative system for reconciling slow boarding speeds with fast rope speeds is the &quot;carpet lift&quot;: the chairs move at full speed even through the terminal. Boarding passengers are progressively accelerated on a system of conveyor belts of carpet-like material until nearly matching the chair speed.

On Sunday, 26 December 2004, Lech am Arlberg and Schröcken in the Bregenzerwald, became the first chairlifts to have heated seats when five Doppelmayr detachable chairlifts offer skiers the added luxury of a warm seat on the uphill trip.

==History==

Doppelmayr (North America) built the first detachable quad chair in the world, the Quicksilver SuperChair, in 1981 at Breckenridge, CO. This chair was later replaced by the Quicksilver Super6, a detachable six person chairlift, by Poma in 1999. Von Roll Habegger installed the &quot;Adirondack Express&quot;, a high-speed triple, the only lift of its kind in the Eastern US, at Gore Mountain, NY in 1984. Then Poma built the first chairlift that went 1,100 feet per minute, the Green Mountain Express, at Sugarbush Resort, VT in 1990.

===Doppelmayr===
The detachable chairlift didn&#x27;t start with a chairlift, rather, it started with the Platter lift in 1908, as the sticks left the cable and attached when someone loaded onto the stick. A detachable two person chairlift called White Lady was installed in Cairngorm Mountain, Scotland in 1961.

In 1981, the first ever high speed detachable quad in the world was installed, the Doppelmayr-built Quicksilver SuperChair at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado. This lift was relocated in 1999 to the Owl&#x27;s Head Ski area in Quebec as &quot;Le Lac&quot;, and was dismantled in 2019 after 38 seasons in two countries. This first detachable chairlift was followed by a Doppelmayr detachable triple chair at Mt Bachelor in Oregon in 1983 and two detachable quads at Mt Buller, Victoria, Australia in 1984.

Until 1985, Quicksilver was also the only detachable quad in Colorado when Vail Ski Resort installed four Doppelmayr high speed quads. In 1988, Vail Ski Resort opened up Orient Express Lift #21, which was the first Doppelmayr chairlift in the U.S. to have rectangular tower heads. The Orient Express was also the first Doppelmayr chairlift in the U.S. to have 800 horsepower. The original grip was slightly modified later before the Vail quads were built. Known as the Spring Series, these grips were known as DS-104 grips on high speed quads and DS-108s on eight passenger gondolas. In 1995, a newer grip was introduced called the Torsion series. Torsion grips were called DT-104 if on a high speed quad, DT-106 on a high speed six pack, or DT-108 on an eight-passenger gondola. The Torsion grip is still made today as Doppelmayr (North America)&#x27;s primary grip option.

Unlike Poma&#x27;s grips, Doppelmayr grips are double position grips. When the chair enters a terminal, the angled roller is pushed down by a metal strip, which opens a grip jaw. The jaw remains open until the chair reattaches to the cable upon departing the terminal. Grip clamping force is measured just prior to the double position grips reattaching to the haul rope while a carrier (chair) is exiting the terminal, in contrast to Poma&#x27;s grips, in which grip force can be measured as the grip travels through the contour. Insufficient grip force triggers an alarm and brings the lift to a halt before the carrier reaches the first breakover tower after the terminal. Because of this design, most Doppelmayr detachable lifts are designed to allow operation in reverse. This allows a grip force-alarmed grip and carrier to be backed into the terminal for inspection or removal.

The original terminals on the Quicksilver Quad were all completely enclosed, but in 1985, in time for the Vail Ski Resort high speed quads, the terminal design changed to what is now classified as a CLD-260 terminal. These and the older terminals were the only types of terminals to use chains instead of tires for contours. In 1989, the old design was officially retired with the addition of the Avanti high speed quad at Vail, and a new design, called the UNI, was introduced. This design was utilized from 1989 to the last year of the DS-104 grip in 1994. In 1992, the design was changed slightly mainly in the entry funnels area. With the introduction of the Torsion series came the UNI-M terminal, which underwent a number of minor cosmetic changes between 1995 and 2002. Currently, two options are offered, the UNI-G terminal, and the UNI-GS terminal, which can be distinguished through the appearance of the end windows. The first UNI-GS chairlift, Panorama, debuted in 2003 at Gunstock Mountain Resort.

===Poma===
Poma entered this market within two to three years of the (Quicksilver Superchair&#x27;s) installation. Although hard to prove, the earliest known Poma quads are from circa 1985, such as the (Coney Glade) at Snowmass, the (Liberator Express) at Mission Ridge (installed in 2005, formally known as (Summit Express), ran at Winter Park Resort from 1985 to 2005), and others. Many of the original high speed quads they built were known as Alpha Evolution lifts, because they utilized a Performance terminal with an Alpha drive unit at the far end. These early chairlifts also had vault drives which were located under the Performance terminal. The old (Colorado Superchair) at Breckenridge Ski Resort, and the (American Flyer) at Copper Mountain are two great examples of Performance terminals with vault drives. Very few lifts exist with this style to this day. Later on, the Performance drive terminal was modified to house the bullwheel machinery inside the main terminal structure itself, eliminating the need to run the cable through the terminal. Poma was also slower at introducing tire contours over chains, and it wasn&#x27;t until 1992 that tire contours were used by the company with the introduction of the Challenger terminal. This terminal would undergo changes with the windows before officially retired in 1998. At that time, the new Omega T-Grip came out and a new terminal known as the Omega was introduced for it. It was replaced by a newer variant that mainly modified the windows on the ends in 2003.

Unlike Doppelmayr, the Poma grips are single position. In such method, they are pressed down, which opens the jaws to detach the chair, and then the jaws close and the spring is released. The process is reversed for attachment. This design allows grip force to be measured as the grip travels through the contour, and for the lift to come to a stop before the grip is reattached to the haul rope if insufficient grip force is detected. Unlike Doppelmayr lifts that check grip force while a grip and carrier are leaving the terminal, most Poma detachable lifts are not built to operate in reverse because a grip force failed grip can be brought to a halt within the terminal.

Poma is also known for building some very unusual lifts, mostly at Breckenridge Ski Resort, which include North America&#x27;s only double loading chairlift (Quicksilver Super6), the first high speed lift in Colorado with a midway load (Peak 8 SuperConnect), and the highest lift in North America (Imperial Express SuperChair) at 12,840 feet. It also built the new highest high speed six pack as of 2022 in North America (Lenawee Mountain Express), located at Arapahoe Basin, with a peak height of .

===CTEC/Garaventa CTEC===

CTEC built their first detachable in 1989 at Solitude Mountain Resort (named the Eagle express). In building this lift they had a rare partnership with Von Roll for their detachable technology. This also happened to be the first detachable quad in Utah. From 1990 on they partnered with Garaventa for their detachable technology before they merged in 1992. They have built detachable lifts at many resorts, such as Grand Targhee, Stevens Pass, Deer Valley, Park City, Snowbird, Alta, Palisades Tahoe, Stratton, and Attitash. They constructed lifts until 2002 when they merged with Doppelmayr. Some Garaventa designs are used to this day.

=== Lift Engineering/Yan ===
Yan Lift, known in its later years as Lift Engineering, built 31 high speed quads between 1987 and 1994, mostly in the United States and Canada. The detachable grips were of an unusual design, in which a steel bar with V-shaped troughs sat atop the haul rope and were held in place by tensioning assembly with rubber springs. These grips relied more on gravity and friction than raw grip force, and were much weaker than other designs. The grips were notorious for slipping, and often required realignment.

Yan stopped building detachables after two fatal accidents. In 1993, a grip failure stacked two chairs together at Sierra-at-Tahoe, killing a 9-year-old boy. Finally, in 1995, 4 chairs plummeted from Whistler Blackcomb&#x27;s Quicksilver lift while it was operating. A chair slipped from the steepest part of the lift, creating a domino effect involving 3 others. All four chairs fell 75 feet upon crashing into the sheaves on the nearest tower, killing 2 riders and injuring 8. Yan filed for bankruptcy in 1997 and has not operated since.

==Present==
===Leitner-Poma===
Leitner-Poma is the present day version of Poma, as joint venture in the United States. In Europe, Poma and Leitner operate as separate ventures. They no longer make these types of detachable products: Arceaux Carrier, Arceaux version 2 Carrier, Performance Terminal, Challenger Terminal, Competition Terminal, Leitner Grip, Omega Terminal, and Omega grip. Now, Leitner-Poma has created an improved Omega carrier, along with the new LPA grip, and a new version of the Omega terminal. Leitner-Poma has good relationships with Breckenridge Ski Resort, Vail Ski Resort, Winter Park Resort, Snowmass, Aspen Mountain, Buttermilk, Aspen Highlands, Okemo, Mount Snow, Sugarbush Resort and many other ski resorts.

===Doppelmayr===
Doppelmayr (North America), formally known as Doppelmayr CTEC is the merger of CTEC, Garaventa, and Doppelmayr globally. They continue to make Garaventa and Dopplemayr Carriers, their UNI-GS/UNI-G (Europe) terminals, and the Torsion grip today. Doppelmayr in the U.S. is starting to discontinue the Garaventa carriers, and replacing them with Doppelmayr EJ carriers. Doppelmayr is known for building the first high speed quad, building the first 8-passenger gondola at Steamboat Ski Resort and having a good relationship with Big Sky Resort, Vail Ski Resort, Beaver Creek Resort, Steamboat Ski Resort, and many other ski resorts.

===Bartholet===
Bartholet is a Swiss maker of chairlifts and gondolas. While they are an important player in the European ski lift market, only a few of their lifts have been installed in Asia and South America. Sadly, there are currently no Bartholet detachable chairlifts in the United States. 

===MND===
French MND has a history of Alpine manufacturing. The company formerly partnered with Bartholet for their grip technology. With this technology having been developed in Europe, the company installed their first U.S. system at Waterville Valley New Hampshire. The lift is called the &quot;Tecumseh Express&quot;, and is a detachable six-person bubble chairlift. In late 2023, Bartholet cancelled its MND partnership when it was purchased by HTI Group (the parent company of Poma, Leitner, Leitner Poma of America and many others). In April of 2024 MND revealed its Orizon line. A new model of Terminals, Grips and carriers. The carriers include a range of comfort chairs from 4 to 6 Place, cabins up to 15 passengers. In mid June 2024
Their prototype model was shown to the public sporting 2 hold-down towers, 1 support tower, a very large cabin and a 6 place chair. These terminals are unique in that they are “gravity assist” where the rails of the terminals slope upward and downward to help slow down and accelerate the carriers.

<text>Richard Travis Whitcomb (February 21, 1921 – October 13, 2009) was an American aeronautical engineer who was noted for his contributions to the science of aerodynamics.

==Biography==
Whitcomb was born in Evanston, Illinois. His father, who had been a balloon pilot in World War I, was a mechanical engineer who specialized in rotational dynamics. In 1932 the family moved to Worcester, Massachusetts when his father became employed at the Norton company.

As a child Whitcomb was fascinated by airplanes; he built models and flew them in competitions, always striving to improve their performance. He graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1943 with a BS in aeronautical engineering. He was employed at the Langley Research Center operated by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and its successor, NASA.

==Career==
===Area rule===

After World War II, NACA research began to focus on near-sonic and low-supersonic airflow. After considering the sudden drag increase which a wing-fuselage combination experiences at somewhere around , Whitcomb concluded that &quot;the disturbances and shock waves are simply a function of the longitudinal variation of the cross-sectional area&quot; – that is, the effect of the wings could be visualized as equivalent to a fuselage with a sort of midriff bulge whose frontal area was the same as that of the wings. Since the wings could not be dispensed with in the actual case, the alternate to removing the &quot;bulge&quot; would be to decrease the fuselage&#x27;s cross-section near the wings. This became known as the area rule, which allowed a significant reduction in the drag felt by airplanes near the speed of sound. Its impact on aircraft design was immediate: the prototype Convair YF-102, for example, was found not to be capable of exceeding the speed of sound in level flight. This was rectified by re-sculpting the fuselage. For his insight, Whitcomb won the Collier Trophy in 1954.

In 1958 Whitcomb was named head of Langley&#x27;s transonic aerodynamics branch, and he began working on a possible SST design. He built proposed models, but by 1962 he abandoned the project because of the intractable drag problem. Casting about for other research, he returned to the question of transonic drag, especially on wings.

===Supercritical airfoil===

To achieve reduced drag in the transonic phase, Whitcomb realized that the wing&#x27;s pressure distribution must be modified to delay and weaken the shock wave created on the upper surface where the high-velocity flow decelerated to subsonic. Using intuition rather than mathematics, he built a chord wing section and tested it repeatedly in the Langley high-speed wind tunnel, adding (with auto body putty) or removing (with a file and sandpaper) material until the desired flows were achieved.

Although a low-drag airfoil (in the transonic range) was thus produced, Whitcomb&#x27;s superiors observed that not every aircraft manufacturer could be expected to use file and sandpaper to design the needed shapes. Therefore, NASA signed a contract with the Courant Institute at New York University, whose mathematician Paul Garabedian and aerodynamicist Antony Jameson worked with Whitcomb to develop a practical computational method for designing supercritical airfoils - those that were most efficient in the transonic range. Using this method, supercritical wings were fabricated and proven on full-scale aircraft; in 1971 a Vought F-8 Crusader, and in 1973 a General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, were flown at the NASA Flight Research Center in California. For his contribution, NASA awarded Whitcomb a $25,000 prize, and he received the 1974 Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy from the National Aeronautic Association.

The unusual airfoil unexpectedly aided general aviation as well: its rather blunt leading edge allowed it to generate high lift coefficients before stalling, and Whitcomb published a low-speed airfoil which he called GA(W)-1; it is now routinely used in light aircraft and gliders.

Following his research on wings, Whitcomb again turned to a possible complete supercritical aircraft, and in 1971 he published preliminary details of a &quot;near-sonic transport&quot; (NST), which he predicted could attain a relatively efficient cruise at 0.98 Mach. As with his supercritical wing efforts, he had largely developed the design in the wind tunnel, shaping his proposed model with putty and knife until the various secondary shocks created by wing-body intersections were muted as much as possible. Whitcomb&#x27;s NST proposal was not advanced beyond his concept stage.

===Winglets===

Aerodynamicists had known for decades that some sort of wingtip barrier could reduce wingtip vortices, and thus the drag. However, Whitcomb was apparently the first to conclude that such a barrier would be most efficient if it took the form of a supplementary vertical (or near-vertical) wing. He proposed his results, showing improvements on the order of 5 percent, but industry was slow to adopt. It took nearly three decades for his proposals to become commonplace; they now are routinely used on aircraft from airliners to gliders.

==Later life==
Following his groundbreaking research on transonic airflow, Whitcomb spent several years moving in an entirely different field - the possible extraction of usable energy from the environment by employing possible avenues of quantum physics. However, these investigations bore no result, and in 1980 he suddenly announced his decision to retire from Langley. Whitcomb continued to serve as a consultant to the aviation industry when asked. He continued to live in an apartment building in Hampton, Virginia, his residence since 1943. He had never married, but for 25 years was close to a NASA mathematician, Barbara Durling. She died in 2001. Whitcomb died in Newport News, Virginia in 2009.

<doc id="299842" wikidata="Q671431" url="?curid=299842" title="Prince Albert, Saskatchewan">
<text>Prince Albert is the third-largest city in Saskatchewan, Canada, after Saskatoon and Regina. It is situated near the centre of the province on the banks of the North Saskatchewan River. The city is known as the &quot;Gateway to the North&quot; because it is the last major centre along the route to the resources of northern Saskatchewan. Prince Albert National Park is located north of the city and contains a wealth of lakes, forest, and wildlife. The city itself is located in a transition zone between the aspen parkland and boreal forest biomes. Prince Albert is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Prince Albert No. 461, of which it is the seat, but is politically separate.

==History==
The area was named &quot;kistahpinanihk&quot; by the Cree, which translates to &quot;sitting pretty place&quot;, &quot;great meeting place&quot; or &quot;meeting place&quot;.

The first trading post set up in the area was built in 1776 by Peter Pond. James Isbister, an Anglo-Métis employee of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, settled on the site of the current city in 1862. He farmed there until 1866, and had been joined by a number of families who called the site Isbister&#x27;s Settlement.

The community received a boost in 1866 when Reverend James Nisbet, a Canada Presbyterian Church minister arrived to establish a mission for the Cree. Nisbet named the mission after Albert, Prince Consort, husband of Queen Victoria, who had died in 1861, from whom the present city derives its name. In 1879, the Presbyterian Church brought out Lucy Margaret Baker to run the local mission school. During the same year, the local Freemasons established the first lodge in what is now the province of Saskatchewan: Kinistino Lodge No. 1, which still exists. &quot;The Mission&quot;, the settlement centrally located, and &quot;Porter Town&quot;, located to the west, were the two communities that would come together to form what is now Prince Albert. The settlement east of Prince Albert was termed Goschen before finally amalgamated, however East Prince Albert still appears on a 1924 map.

In 1884, Honore Jaxon and James Isbister were involved in the movement which brought Louis Riel back to Canada. Riel returned from the United States following a political exile resulting from the Red River Rebellion that had occurred in 1869–1870. Five hundred people gathered to hear Riel speak one month after his return.

In the North-West Rebellion of the 1885, Prince Albert Volunteers bore the heaviest casualties of the fighting at the Battle of Duck Lake. Surrounding settlers took refuge with the North-West Mounted Police in a hastily improvised stockade at Prince Albert, fearing an attack by Gabriel Dumont, which never came. After the Battle of Batoche, Major General Frederick Middleton marched to Prince Albert to relieve the town. Prince Albert, with a population of about 800 people, was incorporated as a town the same year under its first mayor, Thomas McKay. In 1904, the settlement was incorporated as the City of Prince Albert. Its government is of a council-mayor type.

Prince Albert was the capital of the District of Saskatchewan, a regional administrative division of what then constituted the North-West Territories. The District of Saskatchewan was formed on May 8, 1882, and named Prince Albert as its capital. This ended in 1905 when Saskatchewan became a province and Regina was designated the new provincial capital.

Prince Albert was one of the rival candidates to house either the University of Saskatchewan or the Saskatchewan Federal Penitentiary. The university was built in Saskatoon and the penitentiary was built in Prince Albert in 1911.

The federal constituency of Prince Albert has been represented by three prime ministers of Canada:

* John Diefenbaker, 13th Prime Minister (1957–1963), became the Member of Parliament for Lake Centre in 1940, and when that riding was abolished in 1952, represented Prince Albert from 1953 until his death in 1979.
* William Lyon Mackenzie King tenth Prime Minister, represented Prince Albert from 1926 to 1945.
* Sir Wilfrid Laurier seventh Prime Minister, represented Prince Albert in the Saskatchewan provisional district (still part of Northwest Territories) in 1896, before returning to his Quebec East riding later that year.

===Royal visits===

Prince Albert has welcomed the following members of Canada&#x27;s Royal Family:

* The Princess Margaret – 1958 and 1980
* The Duke and Duchess of York (The Prince Andrew and Sarah) – 1989
* The Earl of Wessex (The Prince Edward) – 2003

==Geography==

Prince Albert is located on the White Fox Plain of the Saskatchewan River lowlands. These lowlands are located in the physiographic region of the Saskatchewan Plains Region of the Central Lowlands Province. The natural vegetation of the area consists of aspen parkland to the south and southern boreal forest to the north of the North Saskatchewan River. These two ecoregions have differing soil types: the northern forested soils are brunisolic and sandy, whereas south of the river are black chernozemic soils. The North Saskatchewan River runs through the centre of Prince Albert. The main soils of the city of Prince Albert are those of the valley complex consisting mainly of regosolic soils which produce natural vegetation which are not forest nor grassland but a complex of the two. It is here that the treeline of Saskatchewan begins, and to the north of the city begins the forested growth of Jack Pine &quot;(Pinus banksiana)&quot;, as well as other boreal forest growth in the Prince Albert National Park, and Nisbet forest. The forests north of the city, especially those containing Jack Pine are infected with Dwarf Mistletoe and various projects have been undertaken to stop the spread of this parasitic plant. The agricultural soils around Prince Albert have some limitations and about 35% of the land is covered with sloughs or potholes. Creek systems such as the Red Deer Hill Creek and McFarlane Creek drain into the South Saskatchewan River. In the past these creeks have been known to dry up allowing farmers to cut hay, but in recent years these waterways have been overfilling due to large amounts of winter run-off and increase of the water table. The land use is divided into the southern woodland area north of Prince Albert and cropland to the south.

The Quaternary glacial geology precludes the region to have been covered by the large prehistoric glacial lake called Lake Agassiz. The ancient shoreline can be seen along the &quot;Esker Trail&quot; in Narrow Hills Provincial Park which is just north-east of the city. Many different types of fossils have been found in the Prince Albert region. Along the riverbanks of the Shell River can be observed a stratum containing Quaternary bivalve mollusk shells and in 2014 the vertebrae and bone fragments of a bison were found by local college students attending Saskatchewan Polytechnic in the Shell River area. Various areas (especially eroded river banks) have been known to reveal bison skulls and other various types of fossils. Claims have also been made of various types of marine fossils including oysters, clams, corals and other invertebrates are to be found mixed in fossil matrixes just east of the city near the small village of Love The bedrock geology is a part of the phanerozoic basin and belongs to the Lea Park and Milk River Formation.

The bulk of the city&#x27;s population and commercial areas are located on the south shore of the river, with only a few sparsely populated neighbourhoods, an industrial area, and the airport (along with some parkland) on the north.

===Climate===
Prince Albert experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;). It is close to being subarctic (&quot;Dfc&quot;) with May and September mean temperatures being just above . The coldest month on average is January with an average low of , and July is the hottest month with an average high of . The highest temperature ever recorded in Prince Albert was on July 19, 1941. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on February 1, 1893. Winter lasts five months of the year with January daily mean of , causing a great temperature amplitude in comparison to the mean temperature of July. The variability of the climate is further demonstrated by the brief transition zones with April recording both above and below and respectively.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Prince Albert had a population of 37,756 living in 14,308 of its 15,490 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
For residents over the age of 25 years, 82.7% have a high school diploma (or equivalent), 55.3% have a post-secondary degree; and 17.3% have no certificate, diploma, or degree.

=== Ethnicity ===
Prince Albert has one of the highest Aboriginal population ratios for any Canadian city, at 44.65%.
=== Religion ===
As of the 2021 Census, 58.8% of residents identified as Christian of any denomination, and 36.1% identified as having no religion or having secular beliefs.

==Economy==
Prince Albert is situated on the banks of the North Saskatchewan River, with rich agricultural land to the south and the boreal forest to the north. Although Prince Albert is centrally located in Saskatchewan, it is the second most northerly city in the province after Meadow Lake. This physical location has led to the creation of the slogan &quot;Gateway to the North&quot;.

After being established as a mission centre, the main impetus for growth was speculation that the Transcontinental Railway would travel north from the Red River Valley along Hind&#x27;s fertile belt through to Edmonton. When the Canadian Pacific Railway chose a more southerly route, Prince Albert&#x27;s growth collapsed: 
The La Colle Falls hydroelectric power dam project was an attempt to provide affordable electricity to attract industry By 1927, the project was abandoned as the city was close to bankruptcy. In 1945, Prince Albert National Park was established, and the tourism sector helped to again revive Prince Albert&#x27;s economy.

The city&#x27;s location has benefited the community in many ways through the years as an agriculture, forestry, tourism, mining, retail, and service centre for the immediate market and the northern communities. Prince Albert has a total trade area of 140,000 people, including an additional 12,000 that can be included if Flin Flon and The Pas are accounted for. The major contributing factor to this is the role of Prince Albert as a retail and service centre to these northern communities.

There are a number of major developments that are happening around Prince Albert. Diamond exploration is currently occurring east of the city in the Fort à la Corne region and it is expected a mine may go up around 2010–2011.

In addition to diamond prospects, Bio-fuels are also playing a significant role to the area. The Prince Albert region is one of the richest areas in the province for agriculture, and with the current emphasis on bio-fuel technology from the provincial and federal governments, it is expected that this economic sector will grow. Uranium is also expected to play a bigger role in the future development of Prince Albert. There is speculation that, due to the proximity the uranium mining in northern Saskatchewan, the area could be ideal for a value-added type of business.

Prince Albert is still heavily reliant on its government service sector, which accounts for about 11% of the workforce. There are three prisons, the Prince Albert Correctional Centre, Pine Grove Correctional Centre, and the Saskatchewan Federal Penitentiary.

Chief Joseph Custer, Kistapinanihk 231, Northern Lights 220, Muskoday 99 and Wahpeton 94B Indian Reserves are within of the city.

The forestry industry is also a major contributor to the economy of Prince Albert. Prince Albert currently hosts the Provincial Forestry Centre, a building that hosts significant wood and forestry related types of businesses and associations.

Prince Albert Pulp Company had been the area&#x27;s largest employer since it opened in 1968. The mill was closed down in 2006 by its then owner, Weyerhaeuser. The mill was subsequently sold. Paper Excellence purchased the long-closed down Prince Albert Pulp Inc. from Domtar in April 2011 with plans to operate a dissolving pulp mill producing 1,000 tonnes per day employing about 250 people. The pulp mill was shut down indefinitely and 42 employees laid off on August 29, 2014.

==Attractions==

There are three historical museums in Prince Albert. The combined The Evolution of Education Museum and Rotary Museum of Police and Corrections are located at the tourist information centre just off of Highway #2 South. The second museum, the Historical Society Museum, is located in an old Fire Hall at the north end of Central Avenue on River Street. The John G. Diefenbaker House is a historic site open to the public and is found on 249 19th Street West. The Prince Albert Heritage Museum (c. 1911) is a Municipal Heritage Property on the Canadian Register of Historic Places.

Across from the Historical Society Museum is the site of Diefenbaker&#x27;s constituency office that is not open to the public. Among the other heritage, historic and protected sites of Prince Albert are the Blockhouse from the 1885 Rebellion &amp; First Presbyterian Church/School, Historic St. Paul&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, Honeywood (Dr. A.J. Porter) Heritage Nursery, Keyhole Castle, LaColle Falls Hydroelectric Dam, Oldest Downtown Store, Prince Albert Arts Centre and The Cathedral Church of St. Alban the Martyr (Anglican). Sacred Heart Cathedral (Roman Catholic) near the downtown area was built in 1914 in the Romanesque style. It contains paintings by Berthold Imhoff. The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass of six buildings in Prince Albert.

Other points of interest include:
* The St. Louis Light, a commonly visited, supposedly paranormal, phenomenon occurring south of the city.
* Fort de la Corne, a short distance east from Prince Albert, is the furthest westward post of the French Empire in North America (see New France).
* The Prince Albert Sanatorium, completed in 1930 and treated tuberculosis patients.
* The Buckland Wildlife Management Unit, located within of the city.
* Kinsmen Ski and Snowboard Centre at Little Red River Park

==Sports and recreation==
The city is home to the Prince Albert Raiders of the Western Hockey League. The Raiders, who won the Memorial Cup in 1985, play in the 3,571-seat Art Hauser Centre. The city is also home to the Prince Albert Mintos of the Saskatchewan Midget AAA Hockey League. They won the 2006, 2007 and 2014 Telus Cup. They also play in the Art Hauser Centre.

Prince Albert was the host for the following notable sporting events:
* 1993 North American Indigenous Games
* 2018 U-18 Men&#x27;s Softball World Cup.
* The city will be the host for the 2025 Men&#x27;s Softball World Cup, with the group stage taking place in July 2024 and finals in July 2025. The competition will be held at Prime Minister&#x27;s Park.

* 11th Saskatchewan Winter Games Feb 16th- 22nd, 2014. The Prince Albert community brought together a volunteer workforce and hosted over 1800 amateur athletes from 9 districts in Saskatchewan

==Infrastructure==

The first hospital was constructed in 1899, followed by a maternity home built in 1945 which lasted approximately twelve years.

===Bridges===

At present, only a single road bridge, the Diefenbaker Bridge, connects the north and south shore in Prince Albert; this bridge is also the only river crossing connecting southern and northern Saskatchewan in the immediate vicinity (one needs to drive many kilometres to the east or west to find another).

This has long been a subject of concern in the region, especially in light of a partial closure of the bridge in August 2011 that occurred when cracks were found during an inspection.

===Historic trails===
In 1866, Prince Albert was established as a mission post, and a trail to Fort Carlton arose. This trail connected the growing community to the Carlton Trail, the main land transportation route in Western Canada of the 19th century. The trail followed along the current Lily Plain grid road in Saskatchewan to the ferry service at Lilly Plain post office.

The Qu&#x27;Appelle (Troy) – Prince Albert Trail was in use from 1883 transporting mail and freight goods from the rail depot at Qu&#x27;Appelle across the ferry at St. Louis to Prince Albert.
Besides these two trails, Prince Albert was also served by the Montreal Lake–PA, Green Lake–PA, and Fort à la Corne–PA trails.

===Railways===
====Canadian Northern and Grand Trunk Pacific====
Qu&#x27;Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railroad and Steamboat Company (QLSRSC) arrived in Prince Albert in October 1890 as a means to link the three major cities of Saskatchewan through one railroad. For the next few years the line was seldom used, and in order to raise capital, QLSRSC leased the line out to the Canadian Pacific Railway. Canadian Pacific soon realized the economic uncertainty of the line, and the lease was cancelled after only a few years of service.

By 1906, less than twenty years after the line was completed, it was sold to the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR). Canadian Northern also crossed the North Saskatchewan River, heading west towards Shellbrook. Prince Albert was slated to become a northern hub for rail service into the north, however with little economic activity in the area, no branch lines were ever extended into the north except for the Paddockwood spur, which was subsequently abandoned during the 1990s as a grain-dependent branch line.

Grand Trunk Pacific (GTP) also serviced Prince Albert through a branch line that headed north from Young, through St. Louis and North into Prince Albert. Later both the CNoR and GTP were nationalized, eventually becoming the Canadian National Railway (CN).

====Canadian National and Canadian Pacific====
For years the Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway dominated the city of Prince Albert, operating on both sides of 15th Street. The Canadian Pacific Railway branched off at Lanigan moving north up to Hagen, then under trackage rights with CN, and curved towards the northeast end of Prince Albert. This was CPR&#x27;s principal northern site, with many of the branch lines feeding back to Prince Albert. These branch lines almost entirely served lumber mills and grain elevators as principal commodities.

In 1991 CPR decided to shut down rail line operations in Prince Albert and the surrounding area. CPR sold the Meadow Lake line to CN, and abandoned the Meath Park branch up to Choiceland. Many small CN branch lines extended past Prince Albert hauling primarily grain, but proved ineffective due to larger and more accessible grain elevators. As a result, many were abandoned through the 1990s. Lines that have been abandoned include the Paddockwood Spur (CN), CPR to Meath Park, CPR to Lanigan, CN to Shellbrook, and CN to St. Louis. As grain storage and sorting technology improved over the years, a state of the art Inland elevator was built, located north of Prince Albert. This facility was owned by Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, later succeeded by Viterra. The smaller elevator located in the CN yards — owned by United Grain Growers, later acquired by Agricore United which was also succeeded by Viterra — operated in Prince Albert until Viterra announced its cease of operations on April 1, 2008. Today, only the Inland terminal owned by Viterra, located in White Star, continues to operate.

In December 1997, CN announced the branch line was up for sale due to lack of productivity. The engines primarily used by CN at the time were GMD1s for short haul and yard shunting, and EMD SD40-2W/EMD SD40-2s for long-haul trips. CP utilized switchers due in part to the light rail on many of their branch lines. These switchers were manufactured by Montreal Locomotive Works (Bombardier) and were designated as RS-23.

====Carlton Trail Railway====

OmniTRAX, an American shortline railway company, bought the former CN line and named it Carlton Trail Railway (CTRW or CTR). Currently, Carlton Trail Railway resides in the old CN yard, storing tank cars for CN, transporting grain, and refurbishing diesel engines for other OmniTRAX lines. Carlton Trail has recently discussed abandoning several parts of the shortline due to increasing costs and poor track condition. The Railroad bridge in Prince Albert had the ability to turn in on itself to allow ferry ships to pass through. In 2001 CTRW announced the abandonment of the Birch Hills branch line, but the city of Prince Albert intervened, citing the possibility of an ethanol plant. In 2008 Carlton Trail announced the Meadow Lake line would be abandoned by April 1, 2009. Carlton Trail primarily operates EMD GP10s for switching and long-haul transport.

===Highways===
Prince Albert is located on SK 2, SK 3, SK 11, SK 55, and SK 302. Prince Albert demarks the change of name for SK 2. The stretch of Highway 2 from Moose Jaw to Prince Albert was designated in 2005 as Veterans Memorial Highway. The renaming coincided with Veterans Week 2005. of Saskatchewan Highway 2 contribute to the CanAm Highway between Prince Albert and La Ronge. The CanAm highway south of Prince Albert is designated on SK 3 between Melfort and Prince Albert. SK 11 connects Saskatchewan&#x27;s three largest cities: Regina, Saskatoon, and Prince Albert. On June 20, 2001, the entire length of SK 11 was re-named the Louis Riel Trail at a ceremony which took place at the Duck Lake Regional Interpretive Centre. The Louis Riel Trail connects major sites of the 1885 North-West Rebellion.

===Transit===
Prince Albert Transit is the local city bus service. Prince Albert Transit currently provides service only to the south shore portion of the city.

===Air transport===
Glass Field Airport has regular flights to Saskatoon and Regina and serves as an access point to communities and mining operations north of Prince Albert. Many residents of Prince Albert commute to Saskatoon for flights to further destinations.

==Education==

Anglican Bishop John McLean opened Emmanuel College on November 1, 1879, the first university of the District of Saskatchewan. A federal act later incorporated Emmanuel College into the University of Saskatchewan. Emmanuel College moved to Saskatoon in 1907 to become a part of the provincial University of Saskatchewan, following the inception of Saskatchewan as a province in 1905.

The Saskatchewan Rivers School Division operates 33 schools and the Prince Albert Catholic School Division operates nine schools.
The city has five high schools. St. Mary High School, and Rivier Academy (private, co-ed) are part of the Prince Albert Catholic School Division, while Carlton Comprehensive High School (largest high school in Saskatchewan), Wesmor (Acronym of the rural elementary schools Wildrose, East Central, Spruce Home, Meath Park, Osborne, and Redwing), and P.A.C.I (Prince Albert Collegiate Institute) are in the Saskatchewan Rivers School Division.
École Valois offers preschool to grade 12 and is the only Francophone school in Prince Albert.

Post-secondary schools found in Prince Albert include the Woodland campus of Saskatchewan Polytechnic (formerly Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology) and extension campuses for both the University of Regina and the University of Saskatchewan. Prince Albert is home to branches of the First Nations University of Canada (Northern Campus), Gabriel Dumont Institute, Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technologies (SIIT), and Saskatchewan Urban Native Teacher Education Program (SUNTEP).

<text>James Warren White (born 2 May 1962) is an English professional snooker player who has won four seniors World titles. Nicknamed &quot;The Whirlwind&quot; because of his fluid, swift and attacking style of play, White is the 1980 World Amateur Champion, 2009 Six-red World champion, a record four-time World Seniors Champion (2010, 2019, 2020, 2023), 2019 Seniors 6-Red World Champion and 1984 World Doubles champion with Alex Higgins.

White has won two of snooker&#x27;s three majors: the UK Championship (in 1992) and the Masters (in 1984) and a total of ten ranking events. He is currently eleventh on the all-time list of ranking event winners. He reached six World Championship finals but never won the event; the closest he came was in 1994 when he lost in a final-frame decider against Stephen Hendry. He spent 21 seasons ranked in snooker&#x27;s elite top 16. In team events, he won the Nations Cup and the World Cup with England. He is one of a select number of players to have made over 300 century breaks in professional competition. White was also the first left-handed player, and the second player overall, to record a maximum break at the World Championship.

==Early life==
White was born in Streathbourne Road, Tooting, London, England, and studied at Ernest Bevin School. He never achieved academic success, as he was often truant from school from the age of eight or nine, spending more and more time at Ted Zanoncelli&#x27;s snooker hall. It was around this time that White met Tony Meo, with whom he would compete in money matches in many venues. His natural aptitude for snooker led to a successful amateur career. After winning the English Amateur Championship in 1979, a year later he became the youngest ever winner of the World Amateur Snooker Championship, aged 18, a record since surpassed by Ian Preece and Hossein Vafaei.

==Career==
With a host of major titles and achievements, including ten ranking tournaments, White&#x27;s overall record ranks him well up the list of snooker&#x27;s most successful players. The BBC describes him as a &quot;legend&quot;. A left-hander, he reached the World Professional Championship Final on six occasions (1984, 1990–1994) but failed to win the sport&#x27;s most prestigious title since his first attempt in 1981. Nonetheless, his consistency waned in the 2000s and a first-round defeat in the 2006 World Championship saw White drop out of the world&#x27;s top 32 player rankings. White&#x27;s continued slide down the rankings saw him drop to 65th but he recovered slightly to move up to no. 56 for the 2009–10 season. White is one of only ten players to have completed a maximum break at the Crucible Theatre, doing so in the 1992 World Snooker Championship. He has compiled more than 300 century breaks during his career.

===1976–1991===
White&#x27;s greatest achievement of his young career was in winning the English Amateur Championships. In the London Section, he beat M Goodchild 4–0, D Asbury 4–3, R Birt 4–0, Tony Meo 4–2 in the semi-finals and Danny Adds 4–1 in the final. This took him to the Southern Area proper where he beat Mark Wildman 4–3, Meirion Williams 4–3, George Eaton 5–3 and Cliff Wilson 8–5 in the final. Dave Martin, who won the Northern Section, was beaten 13–10 in the final itself. He suffered a couple of unexpected losses after this – to Walt Ley in the Westward Ho! Open semi-final, 2–3 and to Dave Gilbert, 2–3, in the London Final of the British Junior (U-19) Championships 1–3 (White made a break of 105 in an earlier round). He came back, however, by retaining the Wandsworth Classic beating Tony O&#x27;Beirne, Wally West and Dave Gilbert in the last three rounds and also reaching the final of the Pontins Spring Open (out of 1034 entries), beating Doug Mountjoy 4–1, Neville Suthers 4–1, John Howell 4–0 and Paul Medati 4–1 before losing 3–7 to Steve Davis, despite Davis giving White thirty points start per frame. He was knocked out of the 1st round of the Pontins junior competition by John Carney. In the Lucania Junior Masters, he was beaten on frame countback but showed his class to reach the final of the Warners Open, losing to Tony Meo 2–5, having beaten John Law, John Virgo and Nick Fairall. Steve Davis beat him again, this time 4–0 in the North Ormesby Invitation (after having beaten Willie Thorne 4–0 in the quarter-final) and then lost in the next three tournaments to Dennis Hughes 1–5 (Demmy Manchester Classic), B Jones (Pontins Autumn Open) and Roy Connor. In the Canadian Open, he defeated Tony Knowles 9–5 but lost 3–9 to Steve Davis in the last 16.

1980 opened with him winning the Demmy Pro-Am, defeating Tony Knowles 5–1, Willie Thorne 5–1, Dave Martin 5–1, Alex Higgins 5–3 and Steve Davis in the final 5–2. Davis beat White in the semi-finals of the Invitation tournament at Louth Town &amp; Country Club. Having beaten Thorne, again, 5–3, Davis pipped White 6–5. White made an unsuccessful defence of his English Amateur title when he lost to Mike Darrington in the semi-finals of the Southern Area, 5–8, having beaten Dave Gilbert 8–5 and Geoff Foulds 8–2. Tony Knowles beat him in an early round of the Pegasus Snooker Club Pro-Am 3–1 and he had to scratch for being late in the London &amp; South Area of the British Junior Championships having earlier beaten Neal Foulds 3–1. Charlie Gay knocked him out of the Westward Ho! tournament 2–0 and in a qualifying round of the Pontins Spring Open, he lost to Maurice Suckling. Defeats to Greg Baxter, in an early round of the Heineken Lager Open and to Joe Johnson in the North Ormesby Invitation preceded a trip to the Canadian Open where he beat Vic Harris 9–8 before losing to Alex Higgins 7–9. He was also beaten by Dave Gilbert, 0–3, in the Lucania Masters.

White established himself as a top professional in 1981. After losing 8–10 to eventual champion Steve Davis in the first round of the 1981 World Championship, White went on to win his first professional title, the Scottish Masters, beating Cliff Thorburn 9–4 in the final. Thorburn led 3–0 and 4–1 but then White won eight frames in succession to win the title and the £8,000 first prize. Later in the year he also won the Northern Ireland Classic (defeating Davis).

The World Championship has provided the theatre for White&#x27;s greatest disappointments. In 1982, he led Alex Higgins 15–14 in their semi-final, was up 59–0 in the penultimate and was a and away from the final. After missing a red with the rest, however, he could only watch as Higgins compiled a frame-winning 69 break. Higgins won the deciding frame that followed to reach the final.

In 1984 White won the Masters, beating Terry Griffiths 9–5 in the final. He followed this success by reaching his first World Championship final. Trailing Steve Davis 4–12 after the first two sessions, White responded by reducing the deficit to 15–16. He then made an aggressive clearance of 65 to take the score to 16–17, but was unable to build upon a 40-point lead in the following frame, and lost 16–18. White did, however, become a World Doubles Champion later that year when he and Alex Higgins defeated Willie Thorne and Cliff Thorburn 10–2 in the final of the World Doubles Championship.

In 1986 White reached his second Masters final, but was defeated by Cliff Thorburn. However, he won the Classic and also retained the Irish Masters title he won in 1985. White won the Classic when he beat Thorburn in the final frame after needing a snooker. Later in the year, he overcame veteran Rex Williams 10–6 to win his first Grand Prix title.

White&#x27;s third-ranking win – the 1987 British Open – helped him to end the 1986–87 season as World number 2, behind Steve Davis who defeated him 16–11 in the semi-finals of the 1987 World Championship. Later that year White and Davis contested a memorable 1987 UK Championship final which Davis won 16–14.

In 1988 he defeated John Campbell, Stephen Hendry and Tony Knowles to reach his fourth World Championship semi-final. He played Terry Griffiths and, trailing 11–13, lost a tied frame on a respotted black. Griffiths went on to reach the final courtesy of a 16–11 win. White did at least manage to consolidate his number-2 world ranking. However the 1988–89 season was less successful, and White&#x27;s ranking slipped. He trailed John Virgo 11–12 in the second round of the 1989 World Championship and looked beaten when his opponent was on a break of 26 in the following frame. Virgo, however, called a foul on himself and White was able to win 13–12. The reprieve was short-lived as White was soundly beaten 7–13 by eventual finalist John Parrott in the quarter-finals. White avenged this defeat later in the year by beating Parrott 18–9 in the final of the invitational World Matchplay.

In 1990, White recorded a 16–14 victory over Steve Davis in the semi-finals of the World Championship. It was Davis&#x27;s first defeat in the event in four years. White subsequently lost his second World Championship final 12–18 to Stephen Hendry. However, White beat Hendry 18–9 to retain his World Matchplay title later in the year and that win was followed by a 10–4 victory over Hendry (after leading 9–0) in the final of the 1991 Classic. White continued his run of success with victory in the short-lived World Masters, beating Tony Drago 10–6 in the final.

Steve James ended Hendry&#x27;s reign as World Champion in the 1991 World Championship and White, in turn, defeated James to reach the final. He played John Parrott and was whitewashed in the first session 0–7. Although White managed to close the gap to 7–11, Parrott was able to seal an 18–11 victory. Parrott then overcame White 16–13 to win the 1991 UK Championship later in 1991.

===1992–2002===
White started 1992 positively and picked up his second British Open title, beating Steve Davis in the semi-finals and James Wattana in the final. He won another ranking title, the European Open, shortly after.

White was drawn against Tony Drago in the first round of the 1992 World Championship. After opening up an 8–4 lead, White made history in the 13th frame by becoming only the second player to make a maximum break in the World Championship. He won £100,000 in prize money for this achievement. Close wins over Alain Robidoux and Jim Wych followed before White met Alan McManus in the semi-finals, where he pulled away from 4–4 to win 16–7. He played Stephen Hendry in the final and won each of the first two sessions to open up a 10–6 lead, which he extended to 12–6 and 14–8. From 14–9, White lost three successive frames from commanding positions. At 14–12, White went when compiling a potentially frame-winning break. Hendry drew level at 14–14 without conceding a further and won the closely contested 29th and 30th frames to lead 16–14. Two completed Hendry&#x27;s ten-frame winning streak and a remarkable 18–14 victory.

White responded well from this significant setback in the early part of the 1992–93 season. He defeated Ken Doherty 10–9 to claim his second 1992 Grand Prix title and followed this with an impressive victory in the 1992 UK Championship. After defeating Alan McManus 9–7 in the semi-finals, White opened up a commanding 6–1 lead in the first session of the final against John Parrott, from where he secured a 16–9 win. White has stated that this was among the best matches he has ever played.

However White toiled for the remainder of the season, and his struggles continued at the 1993 World Championship. He did, however, manage to overcome Joe Swail, Doug Mountjoy and Dennis Taylor to reach the semi-finals. White lost the first five frames of his semi-final with James Wattana but, from 2–6, he won 12 successive frames en route to a 16–9 victory. However he proved no match for Stephen Hendry in the final, and Hendry&#x27;s century break in his first visit to the table proved portentous, as White was beaten 18–5 with a session to spare. Only John Parrott (in 1989) has suffered a heavier defeat in a World Championship final. White did, however, manage to end the season on a high note when he beat Alan McManus to win the Matchroom League.

During a 1993 match against Ronnie O’Sullivan, White escaped a snooker on the brown by precisely backspinning the cue ball around the blue to hit the brown. This shot has often been described as &quot;Shot Of The Century&quot;.

White endured a lacklustre campaign in the 1993–94 season but reached the 1994 World Championship final for a fifth successive year, becoming only the second player after Steve Davis (1983–89) to achieve this. For the fourth time in five years, White&#x27;s opponent in the final was Stephen Hendry and the defending champion opened up a 5–1 lead. White recovered well to lead 13–12 and made a break of 75 to take the match into a decider. In the final frame, White was on a break of 29 and leading by 37 points to 24 when he missed a reasonably straightforward black off its spot. Hendry cleared to the pink with a break of 58 to win the title.

White&#x27;s form continued to decline the following season and he failed to reach a ranking final. However, his results on the table were greatly overshadowed, when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer during the season. He recovered after having his left testicle removed.

At the 1995 World Championship, White was involved in a controversial first-round match against South African Peter Francisco. From 2–2 White was able to pull away and win convincingly by 10 frames to 2. Shortly after it emerged that large sums of money had been placed on White to win the match by the eventual scoreline. The ensuing investigation found Francisco guilty of misconduct and banned him for five years. However no evidence was found against White, and he was cleared of any wrongdoing.

White put this controversy behind him and overcame David Roe and John Parrott to reach his tenth World Championship semi-final. In his match with Stephen Hendry, White could only watch as the defending champion made a 147 break to go 8–4 in front. White recovered well to 7–8 and won three successive frames to reduce his arrears from 9–14 to 12–14. However, Hendry proved too strong and ran out a 16–12 win.

White&#x27;s ranking slipped from 7th to 13th at the end of the 1995–96 season and he was beaten 13–12 in a second-round encounter with Peter Ebdon in the 1996 World Championship. White endured further personal problems later in 1996 with the deaths of his brother Martin and mother Lil. His mother&#x27;s death caused him to pull out of the 1996 Mosconi Cup pool competition.

In the 1996–97 season White failed to win a professional match until February and a first-round defeat at the 1997 World Championship against Anthony Hamilton (9–10, after leading 8–4) saw him drop out of the top-16 in the world rankings.

A run to the semi-finals of the 1997 Grand Prix helped to remedy this and White then enjoyed a great form at the 1998 World Championship. After qualifying to play Stephen Hendry in the first round, White opened with a century break and uncharacteristically shrewd matchplay enabled him to open up a 7–0 lead with only one further break over 50. Despite losing the next three frames from winning positions, White was able to seal a memorable 10–4 success and became the first player to beat Hendry twice at the World Championship. White followed this with a 13–3 win over Darren Morgan which included a break of 144. In his quarter-final against Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, however, White reverted to his more familiar all-out attacking style and lost the first session 1–7. Although he fought back to 6–9, White succumbed to 7–13.

After regaining his top-16 ranking in the 1999–2000 season White started 2000 by reaching the semi-finals of the Welsh Open, where he lost 5–6 to Stephen Lee, despite leading 4–1 at one point of the match. He then defeated Marco Fu and John Higgins to reach the quarter-finals of the Masters, and he followed this up with a run to the quarter-finals of the World Championship. On both occasions, however, he was beaten by Matthew Stevens. Largely due to his poor form in the 1998–99 season, White also lost his top-16 place. He fought back the following season, reaching the final of the 2000 British Open (losing 6–9 to Peter Ebdon) and the semi-finals of the 2000 Grand Prix in the early part of the campaign. His only other victory of note, however, was a 6–2 defeat of Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the 2001 Masters and White subsequently failed to qualify for the 2001 World Championship.

Ranked 11 at the start of the 2001–02 season, White performed steadily in the ranking events without reaching a semi-final. In the invitational 2002 Masters he beat Matthew Stevens 6–1 and came back from 2–5 behind to defeat O&#x27;Sullivan 6–5 in the quarter-finals. He similarly recovered from 2–5 down in his semi-final with Mark Williams but lost 5–6. He lost 3–13 in his second-round match with Matthew Stevens at the 2002 World Championship and issued an immediate apology after hitting the cue ball off the table in frustration when trailing 2–5.

===2003–2009===
White won only two ranking event matches in the 2002–03 season but was able to maintain his top-16 ranking. He came back from 1–5 down to defeat World Champion Peter Ebdon 6–5 in their first-round at the 2003 Masters.

In the 2003–04 season White produced his most consistent season in over a decade. After reaching the semi-finals of the 2003 UK Championship in November 2003, White defeated Neil Robertson, Stephen Hendry and Peter Ebdon to reach the semi-finals of the 2004 Masters – where he lost a tight match against Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. White followed this up with further victories over Hendry and Robertson en route to the final of the European Open in Malta, but was beaten 3–9 by world number 48 Stephen Maguire. His last ranking victory to date came in April 2004, when White defeated Shaun Murphy, John Parrott, Ian McCulloch, Peter Ebdon and Paul Hunter to win the Players Championship in Glasgow – his first ranking title in over 11 years. Victory in the 2004 World Championship could have given White the number-one ranking, but he was beaten 10–8 by qualifier Barry Pinches after leading 4–2.

White&#x27;s consistency diminished in the 2004–05 season. Although his ranking rose to number 8 he was unable to reach the quarter-finals of any ranking event. However, he made two more memorable comebacks in the 2005 Masters. White trailed Matthew Stevens 2–5 in the first round and pulled back to 4–5 after needing two snookers in the ninth frame. White went on to win 6–5 and beat Stevens&#x27;s compatriot Mark Williams by the same score in the quarter-finals after trailing 4–5. But White was beaten 6–1 by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the semi-finals.

White fell out of the top-32 at the end of the 2005–06 season and has not regained this status to date. He lost in the first round of the 2006 World Championship, although he did beat Stephen Hendry, Ding Junhui and World Champion Graeme Dott to reach the final of the 2006 Premier League.

In the 2006–07 season he qualified for only one ranking event, the 2007 China Open. He had a walkover of Stephen Lee before he lost 1–5 against John Higgins. After the season, he fell out of the top-48.

In the 2007–08 season he won 7 of his 16 qualifying matches. He won 4 straight matches at the 2007 Grand Prix and finished in the third place of his group, thus not qualifying for the main draw. He won one match at the 2008 Welsh Open and two matches at the 2008 World Championship. After the season, he fell out of the top-64 and remained on the tour only via the one year list.

He began the 2008–09 season by qualifying for the main draw of the 2008 Northern Ireland Trophy and the 2008 Shanghai Masters, but lost in the first round against Barry Hawkins 3–5 and Mark King 4–5 respectively. He won 4 of his next 7 qualifying matches (2 at the 2008 Grand Prix and at the 2008 UK Championship. After this he qualified for the main stage of the 2009 Welsh Open, but lost in the first round 1–5 against Ali Carter. He won his next qualifying match at the 2009 World Championship. In the second qualifying round he defeated Vincent Muldoon 10–8, but lost his next match 8–10 against Andy Hicks. At the end of the season he has the provisional ranking of No. 56.

===2009–2016===
Provisionally ranked number 47 for the 2009–10 season, White showed a surprising return to form at the start of the season when he reached the final of the Champion of Champions Challenge in Killarney, eventually losing 1–5 to Shaun Murphy. His second tournament of the season was the Sangsom 6-red World Grand Prix in Bangkok, Thailand. He won the tournament, putting an end to his drought of titles by claiming his first since 2004. On his way to the final he defeated Shaun Murphy, defending champion Ricky Walden, Mark King, and Mark Williams, eventually beating Barry Hawkins in the final 8–6. One month later, in the Paul Hunter Classic, White again reached the final but this time he lost to Shaun Murphy 0–4. Two months later, on 18 October, he reached the final of the World Series of Snooker in Prague, his fourth final of the season. This time he was victorious, claiming his second title of the season by defeating Graeme Dott 5–3.

In the Wembley Masters, White played Mark King in the wild card round, but lost the match 2–6. Prior to the World Championship, he won only two of his six qualifying matches: he defeated Bjorn Haneveer 5–0 at the Shanghai Masters and Jordan Brown 5–1 at the Welsh Open. Due to this disappointment, and skipping the 2009 UK Championship for &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me out of Here!&quot;, he was at risk of losing his Main Tour spot for the following season. However, he secured his place on the Main Tour for another season with a 10–8 victory over Mark Boyle at the World Championship Qualifiers. He then lost 3–10 against Ken Doherty in the next round.

White started the 2010–11 season by entering the Players Tour Championship, his best performance coming in the first European event and at the sixth event in Sheffield, where he reached the quarter-finals each time. After 12 out of 12 events White was ranked 34th in the Order of Merit.

White also reached the quarter-finals of the Six-red World Championship, topping his qualifying group along the way. He failed to qualify for the Shanghai Masters, losing his first qualifying match 3–5 against Liam Highfield. He won his two qualification matches for the World Open; but lost 1–3 against Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the last 32.

White won the World Seniors Championship, defeating Steve Davis 4–1 in the final.
At the 2010 UK Championship in December, White lost 8–9 to Stephen Hendry in the first-round, after he had come through three qualifying rounds to get to Telford. It was only the fifth time in 24 years that White and Hendry had taken each other to the final frame and 16 years since Hendry&#x27;s 18–17 win over White in the 1994 World Championship final. He participated at qualifying stages of the German Masters, but lost in the second round 1–5 against Jimmy Robertson. White reached the last qualifying round of the Welsh Open, but was whitewashed by Ryan Day, and also qualified for the final stages of the China Open, by defeating Liu Chuang, Peter Lines and Dominic Dale, but had to withdraw from the tournament due to visa problems. White lost his first qualifying match for the World Championship 9–10 against Jimmy Robertson.

White began the 2011–12 season ranked number 55. At a Legends Tour event in June 2011, White compiled a maximum break, unusual for the fact that he potted the first ball off the , meaning his opponent never played a shot in the frame. White failed to qualify for the first two ranking events of the season, as he lost 3–5 against Rory McLeod at the Australian Goldfields Open and 0–5 against Nigel Bond at the Shanghai Masters White failed to defend his World Seniors Championship title, as he lost in the semi-finals 0–2 against eventual champion Darren Morgan. White failed to qualify for the next two ranking events, as he lost 5–6 against Jamie Jones at the 2011 UK Championship, and 4–5 against Peter Ebdon at the German Masters. After the FFB Snooker Open White was ranked number 47.

At the 2013 World Seniors Championship, White lost to Stephen Hendry in the quarter-final.

He finished the 2013–14 season ranked world number 64, almost losing his place on the professional World Snooker circuit. While White remained on the tour, however, fellow veteran Steve Davis lost his place, landing outside the top 64.

White started the season with a 2–5 loss to Fraser Patrick in the qualifying round of the Wuxi Classic, and a 4–5 second-round loss to Scott Donaldson in the Australian Goldfields Open. He then reached the last 64 of the next two European Tour Events, losing to Stuart Bingham and Stephen Maguire respectively.

He had a better result in the EPTC Event 3 where he progressed to the last 16 before losing 0–4 to Shaun Murphy, and in the APTC Event 2 where he made it to another last 16 before once again losing 0–4 to Matthew Selt. He also qualified for the International Championship where he lost 4–6 to Barry Hawkins.

White&#x27;s season ended after an 8–10 defeat to Selt in the second round of qualifying for the 2014 World Championship.

The 2015/16 season ended in disappointment when White lost the deciding frame of his first-round World Championship Qualifier against Gerard Greene.

===2016–present===

White made it to the quarter-final of a ranking event at the Paul Hunter Classic in Germany, his first for over ten years. Despite several good performances, he finished outside the top 64 and lost his tour card after 37 years as a professional. World Snooker, however, chose to give White and Ken Doherty a further two-year invitational tour card.

In White&#x27;s first ranking event of the season, he made it to the last 16 having only made three breaks over 50. He subsequently lost 1–4 to Anthony McGill and then lost 0–5 to Ryan Day in the round of 128 in the China Championship.

White won his first professional title in seven years after winning the UK Seniors Championship as part of the World Seniors Tour. In the quarter-finals, he defeated amateur Les Dodd 3–1 and another amateur Jonathan Bagley by the same scoreline in the semi-finals. He met Ken Doherty in the final and won the match 4–2, thereby winning the first edition of the event. White later played in the qualifiers for the 2018 World Snooker Championship, losing his second-round match to Joe Perry.

In the first Qualifying Round of the 2019 World Snooker Championship, White drew Ross Bulman, an unranked player who had achieved enough success to be selected by the WPBSA for a place in qualifying. White took a 6–3 lead at the end of the first session and won the opening frame of the second session to lead 7–3. Bulman took the following two frames to narrow the gap to 7–5. White won the following three frames in succession to come through the tie a comfortable 10–5 winner to set up a second-round match against Ali Carter. The opening session of White&#x27;s second qualifying round match with Carter finished 5–4. White was unable to win another frame however in the second session and lost the match 4–10.

Winning the World Seniors Championship in August 2019, White qualified for the 2019 Champion of Champions tournament where he narrowly lost 3–4 to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the first round. White recorded no wins in ranking events until the first round of qualifying for the 2020 European Masters, in which he beat Hammad Miah 5–4 after trailing 3–1 and being 4–3 up. White was beaten in Round Two by Mark Selby. In the 2020 World Seniors Championship, Jimmy White came back to beat Ken Doherty 5–4, after trailing 4–0, to retain his title.

In March 2021, White reached the fourth round of the Gibraltar Open, after defeating 2015 world champion, Stuart Bingham.

In May, at the World Seniors Championship, he reached the final, but failed to defend his title as he lost to David Lilley.

White lost in the semifinals of the 2022 UK Seniors Championship to eventual runner-up and reigning seniors champion David Lilley, 4-2.

In May 2022, once again at the World Seniors Championship, White beat Wael Talaat and Rory McLeod, to advance to the semifinals for the fourth year in a row. In the final, White lost to Lee Walker of Wales, 5-4.

In May 2023 White won his fourth World Senior&#x27;s Championship. After defeating Tony Drago in the semi-final, he beat Alfie Burden 53 in the final to secure the title.

In October 2024, White defeated Hossein Vafaei 4–3 in the first round of the Northern Ireland Open.

==Personal life==

White has five children. In 2005, as part of a sponsorship deal with HP Sauce, he changed his name by deed poll to &quot;James Brown&quot; for the Masters. In his autobiography, released in November 2014, White revealed that he was addicted to crack cocaine during a three-month spell of his career. He said that he went from taking cocaine to crack following his defeat by Steve Davis in the 1984 World Championship final. White lives in Epsom, Surrey.

In the late 1990s, White&#x27;s Bull Terrier, Splinter, was dognapped and held for ransom. Splinter became the first dog to have a colour poster on the front page of &quot;The Times&quot;. White paid the ransom, and Splinter was returned to him. Splinter went on to live for another three years.

White is also a pool and poker player. Along with Steve Davis and Alex Higgins, White was a member of Europe&#x27;s victorious Mosconi Cup pool team of 1995, and won the deciding match against Lou Butera. He won the second Poker Million tournament, held in 2003, which also had Steve Davis at the final table. He was also good friends with professional poker player, Dave &quot;The Devilfish&quot; Ulliott.

White is currently a commentator for snooker coverage on Eurosport-UK. 

In April 2015, he appeared as a guest at a campaign event when his friend Kim Rose was standing as the UK Independence Party candidate to be MP for Southampton Itchen.

White has been a supporter of Chelsea F.C. since 1972.

In 2018, White began a relationship with beauty queen Jade Slusarczyk, 23 years his junior.

==In the media==
White played himself (as the World Billiards Champion) in Stephen Chow&#x27;s 1990 kung fu and billiards comedy film, &quot;Legend of the Dragon&quot;.

On the BBC game show &quot;Big Break&quot;, White was the first player to clear the table with 3 reds remaining in the final part of the challenge (thus winning the top prize for the contestant he was playing for). He was introduced to the studio audience on each appearance with the song &quot;Jimmy Jimmy&quot; by the Undertones. White was also the first (and only) winner of the ITV show &quot;Tenball&quot;, featuring a mix between pool and snooker.

In the film &quot;Jack Said&quot; (a prequel to &quot;Jack Says&quot;) White played the part of Vic Lee, a snooker club owner, in his first major film role for British cinema.

White appeared in the 9th series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; He finished in third place on 4 December 2009, with Gino D&#x27;Acampo the eventual winner.

On 23 September 2019, White published an apology on his official Facebook page to Kirk Stevens, stating that in his autobiography &quot;Second Wind&quot; he misremembered a few stories as occurring with Kirk Stevens that in fact did not. These events were widely broadcast in the media and White wanted to make the apology public to prevent them from being repeated. White further stated that he did not intend his words to be interpreted as meaning that Kirk Stevens introduced him to crack cocaine or that Stevens ever played WPBSA snooker under the influence of drugs.

White has endorsed four computer games: &quot;Jimmy White&#x27;s &#x27;Whirlwind&#x27; Snooker&quot;, &quot;Jimmy White&#x27;s 2: Cueball&quot;, &quot;Jimmy White&#x27;s Cueball World&quot; and &quot;Pool Paradise&quot;. These games have been released for numerous machines, from 16-bit systems up to sixth-generation consoles and mobile phones. In June 2007, he was contracted to the online billiard website Play89.

White was portrayed by James Bailey in the BBC film &quot;The Rack Pack&quot;, which focused on the rivalry between Alex Higgins and Steve Davis in the 1980s.

<text>Structural information theory (SIT) is a theory about human perception and in particular about visual perceptual organization, which is a neuro-cognitive process. It has been applied to a wide range of research topics, mostly in visual form perception but also in, for instance, visual ergonomics, data visualization, and music perception.

SIT began as a quantitative model of visual pattern classification. Nowadays, it includes quantitative models of symmetry perception and amodal completion, and is theoretically sustained by a perceptually adequate formalization of visual regularity, a quantitative account of viewpoint dependencies, and a powerful form of neurocomputation. SIT has been argued to be the best defined and most successful extension of Gestalt ideas. It is the only Gestalt approach providing a formal calculus that generates plausible perceptual interpretations.

== The simplicity principle ==

A simplest code is a code with minimum information load, that is, a code that enables a reconstruction of the stimulus using a minimum number of descriptive parameters. Such a code is obtained by capturing a maximum amount of visual regularity and yields a hierarchical organization of the stimulus in terms of wholes and parts.

The assumption that the visual system prefers simplest interpretations is called the simplicity principle. Historically, the simplicity principle is an information-theoretical translation of the Gestalt law of Prägnanz, which was inspired by the natural tendency of physical systems to settle into relatively stable states defined by a minimum of free-energy. Furthermore, just as the later-proposed minimum description length principle in algorithmic information theory (AIT), a.k.a. the theory of Kolmogorov complexity, it can be seen as a formalization of Occam&#x27;s Razor, according to which the simplest interpretation of data is the best one.

== Simplicity versus likelihood ==

Crucial to the latter finding is the distinction between, and integration of, viewpoint-independent and viewpoint-dependent factors in vision, as proposed in SIT&#x27;s empirically successful model of amodal completion. In the Bayesian framework, these factors correspond to prior probabilities and conditional probabilities, respectively. In SIT&#x27;s model, however, both factors are quantified in terms of complexities, that is, complexities of objects and of their spatial relationships, respectively.

== Modeling principles ==

In SIT&#x27;s formal coding model, candidate interpretations of a stimulus are represented by symbol strings, in which identical symbols refer to identical perceptual primitives (e.g., blobs or edges). Every substring of such a string represents a spatially contiguous part of an interpretation, so that the entire string can be read as a reconstruction recipe for the interpretation and, thereby, for the stimulus. These strings then are encoded (i.e., they are searched for visual regularities) to find the interpretation with the simplest code.

This encoding is performed by way of symbol manipulation, which, in psychology, has led to critical statements of the sort of &quot;SIT assumes that the brain performs symbol manipulation&quot;. Such statements, however, fall in the same category as statements such as &quot;physics assumes that nature applies formulas such as Einstein&#x27;s &quot;E=mc&quot;2 or Newton&#x27;s &quot;F=ma&quot;&quot; and &quot;DST models assume that dynamic systems apply differential equations&quot;.

== Visual regularity ==

To obtain simplest codes, SIT applies coding rules that capture the kinds of regularity called iteration, symmetry, and alternation. These have been shown to be the only regularities that satisfy the formal criteria of
(a) being holographic regularities that (b) allow for hierarchically transparent codes.

A crucial difference with respect to the traditionally considered transformational formalization of visual regularity is that, holographically, mirror symmetry is composed of many relationships between symmetry pairs rather than one relationship between symmetry halves. Whereas the transformational characterization may be suited better for object recognition, the holographic characterization seems more consistent with the buildup of mental representations in object perception.

The perceptual relevance of the criteria of holography and transparency has been verified in the holographic approach to visual regularity. It also explains that the detectability of mirror symmetries and Glass pattens in the presence of noise follows a psychophysical law that improves on Weber&#x27;s law.

<text>A baguette (; ) is a long, thin type of bread of French origin that is commonly made from basic lean dough (the dough, not the shape, is defined by French law). It is distinguishable by its length and crisp crust.

A baguette has a diameter of about and a usual length of about , but can be up to long.

In November 2018, documentation surrounding the &quot;craftsmanship and culture&quot; of making this bread was added to the French Ministry of Culture&#x27;s National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage. In 2022, the artisanal know-how and culture of baguette bread was inscribed to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

==History==
Much of the history of the baguette is speculation; however, some facts can be established. Long, stick-like breads in France became more popular during the 18th century, French bakers started using &quot;&quot;gruau&quot;,&quot; a highly refined Hungarian high-milled flour in the early 19th century, Viennese steam oven baking was introduced to Paris in 1839 by August Zang, and the Austrian &#x27;s compact yeast in 1867 at the Universal Exposition. Finally, the word &quot;baguette&quot; appears to define a particular type of bread in a regulation of the department of the Seine in August 1920: &quot;The baguette, having a minimum weight of and a maximum length of , may not be sold for a price higher than 0.35 francs apiece&quot;. No one of these events constitutes &quot;the invention of the baguette,&quot; but together they define the modern &quot;baguette.&quot;

In summary, &quot;the bread which became known as the baguette first appeared in its most primitive form in the eighteenth century, then experienced several refinements and variations before being (officially) given that name in 1920.&quot;

The word &quot;baguette&quot; means &quot;wand,&quot; &quot;baton,&quot; or &quot;stick,&quot; as in &quot;baguette magique&quot; (magic wand), &quot;baguettes chinoises&quot; (chopsticks), or &quot;baguette de direction&quot; (conductor&#x27;s baton). It was first recorded as a kind of bread in 1920.

Outside France, the baguette is often considered a symbol of French culture, but the association of France with long loaves long predates it. Long, wide loaves had been made since the time of King Louis XIV, long thin ones since the mid-18th century, and by the 19th century, some were far longer than today&#x27;s baguette: &quot;... loaves of bread long that look like crowbars!&quot; &quot;Housemaids were hurrying homewards with their purchases for various Gallic breakfasts, and the long sticks of bread, a yard or two [ to ] in length, carried under their arms, made an odd impression upon me.&quot;

A less direct link can be made with deck or steam ovens. These combine a traditional gas-fired oven and a brick oven, a thick &quot;deck&quot; of stone or firebrick heated by natural gas instead of wood. The first steam oven was brought to Paris in the early 19th century by August Zang, who also introduced Vienna bread (&quot;pain viennois&quot;) and the croissant, and whom some French sources thus credit with originating the baguette.

Deck ovens heated to over use steam injection to allow the crust to expand before setting, thus creating a lighter, airier loaf, and to melt the dextrose on the bread&#x27;s surface, giving a slightly glazed effect.

In April 1944, a competition called began in France to determine who made the best baguettes. Nearly 200 bakers compete each year in front of a 14-judge panel following strict guidelines. They are judged based on baking, appearance, smell, taste, and crumb. The winner receives €4000 and supplies France&#x27;s president with their daily bread for that year until a new winner is chosen.

Following the World Wars, French bakers began baking a whiter, softer baguette that contrasted with the darker loaves produced because of rationing during the wars. These doughs took less time to ferment and used more additives but had significantly less taste. They also began using pre-made dough and molds. The average consumption of bread fell from 600 grams/day in the early 1900s to 170 grams/day in 1986.

In 1993, the French Parliament passed &quot;Le Décret Pain&quot; (The Bread Decree). &quot;Le Décret Pain&quot; states that breads under the name of &quot;pain maison&quot; (homemade bread) must be &quot;fully kneaded, shaped, and baked at their place of sale.&quot; This decree also placed strict guidelines on what &quot;pain traditionnel français&quot; (traditional French bread) is allowed to be made of, banning pre-made dough from being used for traditional French baguettes.

=== Origin myths ===
Because the history of the French baguette is not completely known, several myths have spread about the origins of this type of bread.

Some say Napoleon Bonaparte, in essence, created the French baguette to allow soldiers to more easily carry bread with them. Since the round shape of other breads took up a lot of space, Bonaparte requested they be made into the skinny stick shape with specific measurements to slide into the soldiers&#x27; uniform.

Other stories credit baguettes as being an invention to stop French metro workers from having to carry knives that they used to cut their bread. The workers often fought, so the management did not want them to carry knives and requested that bread be easily ripped apart, ending the need for knives. The skinny, easily rippable shape of a baguette would have been the response to this.

Some believe baguettes were the &quot;Bread of Equality&quot; following a decree post-French Revolution requiring a type of bread to be made accessible to the rich and poor.

Another account states that in October 1920, a law prevented bakers from working before 4 am, making it impossible to make traditional round loaves in time for customers&#x27; breakfasts. Switching from the round loaf to the previously less-common, slender shape of the baguette solved the problem because it could be prepared and baked much more quickly. The law in question appears to be one from March 1919, though some say it took effect in October 1920:It is forbidden to employ workers at bread and pastry making between ten in the evening and four in the morning.

==Manufacture and styles==

The &quot;baguette de tradition française&quot; is made from wheat flour, water, yeast (as the leavening agent), and common salt. It may contain up to 2% broad bean flour, up to 0.5% soya flour, and up to 0.3% wheat malt flour.

Standard baguettes, &quot;baguettes ordinaires&quot;, are made with baker&#x27;s yeast, and artisan-style loaves are usually made with a pre-ferment (&quot;poolish&quot;) to increase flavor complexity and other characteristics. They may include whole-wheat flour or other grains such as rye. Baguettes are also sometimes referred to as either &quot;Classique&quot; (typically mass produced and made with yeast as well as additives), and &quot;tradition&quot; regulated to 4 ingredients (flour, water, leavening, and salt) often using a sourdough starter as the leavening agent 

Baguettes are closely connected to France, though they are made worldwide. In France, not all long loaves are baguettes; for example, a short, almost rugby ball-shaped loaf is a &quot;bâtard&quot; (literally, bastard); its origin is variously explained but undocumented. Another tubular-shaped loaf is known as a &quot;flûte&quot;, also known in the United States as a &quot;parisienne&quot;. Flûtes closely resemble baguettes but are about twice the size.

A thinner loaf is called a &quot;ficelle&quot; (string). A short baguette is sometimes known as a &quot;baton&quot; (stick), or in the UK, referred to using the English translation &quot;French stick&quot;. None of these are officially defined, either legally or, for instance, in major dictionaries, any more than the baguette. French breads are also made in forms such as a &quot;miche&quot;, which is a large pan loaf, and a &quot;boule&quot;, literally ball in French, a large round loaf. Sandwich-sized loaves are sometimes known as &quot;demi-baguettes&quot; or &quot;tiers&quot;. Italian baguettes, or &quot;baguette italienne&quot;, involve more spices and a denser texture, giving the baguette a slightly different, more Italian taste. &quot;Pain viennois&quot; is much sweeter and softer than the standard baguette.
In France, a baguette typically weighs around , a bâtard and a ficelle ; no legal text establishes any of these weights, which can vary throughout the country. Baguettes, either relatively short single-serving size or cut from a longer loaf, are very often used for sandwiches, usually of the submarine sandwich type, but also a panini. They are often sliced and served with pâté or cheese. As part of the traditional continental breakfast in France, slices of baguette, known as &quot;tartines&quot;, are spread with butter and jam and sometimes dunked in bowls of coffee or hot chocolate.

Baguettes are generally made as partially free-form loaves, with the loaf formed with a series of folding and rolling motions, raised in cloth-lined baskets or in rows on a flour-impregnated towel, called a couche, and baked either directly on the hearth of a deck oven or in special perforated pans designed to hold the shape of the baguette while allowing heat through the perforations. American-style &quot;French bread&quot; is generally much fatter and is not baked in deck ovens but in convection ovens.

As of the 2000s, there is increasing customer demand in France for only partially baked baguettes. In 2004, the bakery chain Marie Blachère introduced the option to select three varieties of baguettes distinguished by baking time: &quot;bien cuite&quot; (well done), &quot;dorée&quot; (golden) and &quot;blanche&quot; (white).

Outside France, baguettes are also made with other doughs. For example, the Vietnamese &quot;bánh mì&quot; uses a high proportion of rice flour, while many North American bakeries make whole wheat, multigrain, and sourdough baguettes alongside French-style loaves. In Cambodia, it is found in the form of a hot sandwich filled called num pang. In addition, even classic French-style recipes vary from place to place, with some recipes adding small amounts of milk, butter, sugar, or malt extract, depending on the desired flavor and properties in the final loaf.

==Consumption==

Algeria consumes about 49 million baguettes per day, and France consumes about 30 million.

<text>In United States local government, a consolidated city-county (see below for alternative terms) is formed when one or more cities and their surrounding county (parish in Louisiana, borough in Alaska) merge into one unified jurisdiction. As such it is a type of unitary authority that has the governmental powers of both a municipal corporation and a county.

A consolidated city-county is different from an independent city, although the latter may result from consolidation of a city and a county and may also have the same powers as a consolidated city-county. An independent city is a city not deemed by its state to be located within the boundary of any county and considered a primary administrative division of its state. A consolidated city-county differs from an independent city in that the city and county both nominally exist, although they have a consolidated government, whereas in an independent city, the county does not even nominally exist. Furthermore, a consolidated city-county may still contain independent municipalities maintaining some governmental powers that did not merge with the rest of the county.

Not considering Hawaii, which has no independent municipalities, the Midwest and Upper South have the highest concentration of large consolidated city-county governments in the United States, including Indianapolis, Indiana; Nashville, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; Kansas City, Kansas; and Lexington, Kentucky. The largest consolidated city-county in the United States by population is Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, while the largest by land area is Sitka, Alaska.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;consolidated city-county&quot; refers to a consolidated jurisdiction in a state that is otherwise divided into counties. In Louisiana, which is divided into parishes, the equivalent jurisdiction is known as either a city-parish or a consolidated government, depending on the locality. In Alaska, it is known as a unified municipality, unified home rule borough, or city and borough. The United States Census Bureau generically refers to any such jurisdiction as a consolidated city, regardless of the jurisdiction into with the city has consolidated. Although California is divided into counties, a consolidated city-county is officially termed a city and county.

==Overview==
Consolidated city-counties are typically formed to address particular government challenges. Among the benefits of having a unified jurisdiction include potential cost savings, more efficiency, increased legal powers and revenue sources, and a more streamlined planning system.

Most consolidated city-counties have a single chief executive who acts as both the city mayor and as the head of the county government, and a multi-district elected body that serves as both the city council and as the county legislative body.

In many states, consolidated city-counties must be approved by voters. According to information compiled by former Albuquerque mayor David Rusk, 105 referendums were held in the United States between 1902 and 2010 to consider proposals to consolidate cities and counties. Only 27 of these proposals were approved by voters.

Wyandotte County, Kansas, uses the term &quot;unified government&quot; to refer to its consolidation with Kansas City, Kansas, and most of the towns within the county boundaries remain separate jurisdictions within the county. Individual sections of a metropolitan or regional municipality may retain some autonomous jurisdiction apart from the citywide government.

Often, in place of another level of government, local governments form councils of governments – essentially governmental organizations which are not empowered with any law-making or law enforcement powers. This is the case in the Atlanta metropolitan area, where the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) studies and makes recommendations on the impact of all major construction and development projects on the region, but generally cannot stop them. The Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA) is a true government agency of the state of Georgia, and does control some state transportation funding to the cities and counties, but otherwise has very little authority beyond this small power of the purse.

In California, a city and county&#x27;s chartered city powers supersede its chartered county powers. However, because the city and county has territorial jurisdiction exclusive of other counties, it also has county officers, and the state counts it as a county for certain purposes.

Despite being consolidated with New Orleans, Orleans Parish retains a nominal, &quot;sui generis&quot; status under Louisiana state law that guarantees the city&#x27;s home rule. It has been effectively abolished as a distinct governmental unit. However, various parish offices remain with a degree of independence from the city government, while in other matters, the city represents the parish. Originally, Orleans Parish was led by a police jury, but it had only limited authority within the City of New Orleans. In 1822, when the police jury began to be elected popularly, the New Orleans City Council was granted a veto over fiscal matters. In 1840, a second police jury was established with authority over the right bank of the Mississippi River (that is, Algiers). By 1846, the original police jury had become inactive and was abolished, consolidating the left bank with New Orleans. In 1870, the remainder of Orleans Parish was consolidated when the city became coextensive with the parish. The city and parish have also annexed parts of neighboring Jefferson Parish.

The case of New York City is unique, in that the city consists of five boroughs, each of which is co-extensive with a county. Each has its own district attorney; however, county-level government is essentially non-existent as all executive and legislative power is exercised by the city government throughout the five boroughs. The city, as currently constituted, was created in 1898 when the city of New York (then comprising what would become the boroughs of Manhattan and The Bronx) annexed Kings County, Queens County, and Richmond County as the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island, respectively.

=== International equivalents ===

Similar unitary authority arrangements also exist in other countries. 

==== United Kingdom ====
England has six &quot;metropolitan counties&quot; created in 1974: Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. From 1986, these metropolitan counties do not have county councils but rather joint boards for certain functions. Modern unitary authorities are similar, and are known as &quot;county boroughs&quot; in Wales. In Scotland, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow are functionally &quot;independent cities&quot;, though the term is not used. London is unique however, being a ceremonial county (officially known as Greater London) containing the 32 London boroughs. Enclaved within Greater London, the ancient City of London forms a distinct county, which today forms only a tiny part of what most consider to be &quot;London&quot; as a capital city, which takes up 607 square miles.

==== Europe ====
In Germany, Berlin and Hamburg are both cities and states (the state of Bremen consists of the cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven). Nearly every larger city in Germany is an independent city, like Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich or Dresden; Austria, where the capital of Vienna is both a city and state; France, where the capital city of Paris has been coterminous with the &quot;département&quot; of Paris since 1968.

==== Russia ====
In Russia, there are urban districts - territories consisting of a city and nearby settlements united by one mayor&#x27;s office. As a rule, urban districts are the capitals of the constituent entities of the Russia and other major cities in the region. In 2020, there were 635 urban districts.

==== Canada ====
The Canadian province of Ontario contains several single-tier municipalities. They can be similar to American consolidated city-counties in that they are often formed by amalgamating an upper-tier municipality. However, they are functionally independent cities as, unlike a consolidated city-county, the county or region ceases to exist after being amalgamated and does not continue on a nominal basis, leaving only the unified single-tier city. One example is the City of Toronto, created in 1998 from the amalgamation of the central government and the six constituent municipalities of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (a type of regional municipality), itself originally created in 1954.

The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality in British Columbia is also a single-tier municipality, functioning as both a regional district and a district municipality. It was formed in 2009 by amalgamating the former Northern Rockies Regional District.

==== Tokyo ====
In 1943, the City of Tokyo was amalgamated with the former Tokyo Prefecture to form the Tokyo Metropolis. The present form of Tokyo functions similarly to a prefecture, having a central government along with several autonomous subdivisions. The original Tokyo City was split into 23 &quot;special wards&quot; which effectively function as cities. In addition, there are also 23 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages within Tokyo. Under this structure, Tokyo does not have a single mayor, but rather a governor and numerous local mayors. Further, some responsibilities that would normally be held by the cities are instead held by the metropolitan government. Currently, Tokyo is the only place designated as a metropolis.

==== South Korea ====
Seoul is a &quot;special city&quot;, while six other cities (Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, Gwangju, Incheon, and Ulsan) are &quot;metropolitan cities&quot;. 

==== Australia ====
Municipalities in Australia, or &quot;Local Government Areas&quot; (LGAs) as they are officially known, are all single-tier entities with no government in-between them and the state or territory. However, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) does not have any LGAs. Instead, the territorial government performs all municipal functions of the city of Canberra, and thus functions as an integrated city-territory.

==Balances==
In nine consolidated city-county governments in the United States, the formerly independent incorporated places maintain some governmental powers. In these cities, which the United States Census Bureau calls &quot;consolidated cities&quot;, statistics are recorded both for the entire consolidated government and for the component municipalities. A part of the consolidated government is called the &quot;balance&quot;, which the Census Bureau defines as &quot;the consolidated city minus the semi-independent incorporated places located within the consolidated city&quot;.

In Georgia, consolidations often required multiple attempts, changes in procedures, and different local laws in the state legislature. They often did not include some smaller jurisdictions. They also retained characteristics of both types of government, e.g, a sheriff as required by the Georgia Constitution.

These consolidated cities are:
* Athens–Clarke County, Georgia
* Augusta–Richmond County, Georgia
* Butte–Silver Bow County, Montana
* Indianapolis–Marion County, Indiana
* Jacksonville–Duval County, Florida
* Kansas City, Kansas–Wyandotte County, Kansas
* Louisville–Jefferson County, Kentucky
* Nashville–Davidson County, Tennessee

==List of consolidated city-counties==

===Consolidated as a single entity===
The following consolidated city-counties are considered single entities encompassing both a city and a county, such as &quot;City and County of San Francisco&quot;.
* Alaska
** Municipality of Anchorage: City and Borough are consolidated forming a unified government.
** City and Borough of Juneau
** City and Borough of Sitka
** Municipality and Borough of Skagway
** City and Borough of Wrangell
** City and Borough of Yakutat
* California
** City and County of San Francisco: The City of San Francisco was the seat of San Francisco County until 1856, when the county was split into the consolidated City and County of San Francisco in the north, with the remainder of old San Francisco County becoming the new County of San Mateo.
* Colorado
** City and County of Broomfield: Town of Broomfield incorporated June 1, 1961. Consolidated City and County of Broomfield created November 15, 2001, from the incorporated City of Broomfield in portions of Boulder, Adams, Jefferson, and Weld Counties.
** City and County of Denver: Denver City, Colorado Territory, incorporated November 7, 1861. Denver served as the Arapahoe County seat until November 15, 1902, when Arapahoe County was split into the new Adams County and the renamed South Arapahoe County. Denver was split from the two new counties on December 1, 1902.
* Hawaii
** City and County of Honolulu
* Massachusetts
** Town and County of Nantucket: one and the same since it was separated from Dukes County, New York to join the colony of Massachusetts. In New England a town serves the same municipal functions as a city. Contrary to city–county consolidation, eight of Massachusetts&#x27; 14 county governments have been abolished.

===Merged===
The following consolidated city-counties merged a previously existing city and county and are still considered two separate entities, both a city and a county, even though the government functions have been consolidated.
====With no independent municipalities====
* Alaska
** Haines and Haines Borough
* Georgia
** Columbus and Muscogee County
** Cusseta and Chattahoochee County
** Georgetown and Quitman County
** Macon (and Payne) with Bibb County
** Preston and Webster County
** Statenville and Echols County
* Louisiana
** Houma and Terrebonne Parish (Despite the consolidated city-parish &quot;government&quot;, Houma is not coterminous with Terrebonne Parish; Houma remains a geographically distinct municipality within the parish.) 
** New Orleans and Orleans Parish
* Montana
** Anaconda and Deer Lodge County
** Butte and Silver Bow County

* New York
** City of New York
*** Borough of Manhattan and New York County
*** Borough of the Bronx and Bronx County
*** Borough of Brooklyn and Kings County, New York
*** Borough of Staten Island and Richmond County, New York
*** Borough of Queens and Queens County, New York

* Tennessee
** Hartsville and Trousdale County (Despite the consolidated city-county &quot;government&quot;, Hartsville is not coterminous with Trousdale County; Hartsville remains a geographically distinct municipality within the county.) 
** Lynchburg and Moore County
*Kentucky
** Lexington and Fayette County
* New Mexico
** Los Alamos and Los Alamos County – The town of Los Alamos consolidated with county of the same name in 1969.
*Pennsylvania
** Philadelphia and Philadelphia County – Their borders have been conterminous since 1854 Act of Consolidation, and the government structures were consolidated in 1952. The county still exists as a separate entity within Pennsylvania, but the functions of the county are generally administered by the city.

====With other independent municipalities====
* Alaska
** Petersburg Borough (When the borough was created in 2013, the city of Petersburg was dissolved. However, the city of Kupreanof remains a separate entity within the borough.)

* Florida
** Jacksonville and Duval County (four incorporated places within Duval County – the cities of Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and Atlantic Beach and the town of Baldwin – retain separate governments; all other rural land is incorporated by Jacksonville and so the entire county is incorporated)

* Georgia
** Athens and Clarke County (the cities of Winterville, which is entirely within Clarke County, and Bogart, which is partially within the county, retain separate governments)
** Augusta and Richmond County (two communities within Richmond County retain separate governments)

* Indiana
** Indianapolis and Marion County (four communities within Marion County retain separate governments: see Unigov)

* Louisiana
** Baton Rouge and East Baton Rouge Parish (three communities within East Baton Rouge Parish – Baker, Central and Zachary – retain separate governments. In addition, the City of Baton Rouge retains separate city limits, and its official census population only includes this area)
** Lafayette and Lafayette Parish (In December 2018 voters amended the city-parish charter to split what was a single consolidated city-parish council into two councils — one to represent only the city of Lafayette and the other to represent the parish. The impetus for the change was the desire of city voters to take more control of city-related matters and general unease with the consequences of consolidation).

* North Carolina
** Camden and Camden County (a census-designated place within a county with no incorporated municipalities apart from a small portion of Elizabeth City, re-organizing into a single unified government)

* Kansas
** Kansas City and Wyandotte County (this &quot;Unified Government&quot; contains Kansas City, Edwardsville, most of Bonner Springs, and roughly half of Lake Quivira; a county relationship is maintained with the rest of the communities within the county) as of 1997.
** Tribune and Greeley County (Horace retaining a separate government)

*Kentucky
** Louisville and Jefferson County (all cities in pre-merger Jefferson County, other than Louisville, retain separate identities and some governmental functions, but all participate fully in the county-wide governing body, Louisville Metro Council)

* Tennessee
** Nashville and Davidson County (six communities within Davidson County retain separate governments, although all participate in the metropolitan government in a two-tier system)

Note: Five cities in the Hampton Roads region of Virginia were formed by the consolidation of a city with a county: Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach (from Norfolk, Elizabeth City, Warwick, Nansemond, and Princess Anne counties, respectively). However, in each case an independent city was created and as such they are not consolidated city-counties. Instead, the Code of Virginia uses the term &quot;consolidated city&quot;. Similarly, Carson City was consolidated with Ormsby County, Nevada in 1969, but the county was simultaneously dissolved. The city is now a municipality independent of any county.

===Other===
* New York City is coextensive with an amalgamation of five consolidated city-counties, each county coextensive with a borough of New York City:
** New York County (Borough of Manhattan)
** Bronx County (Borough of the Bronx)
** Kings County (Borough of Brooklyn)
** Richmond County (Borough of Staten Island)
** Queens County (Borough of Queens)
* Washington, D.C. – While the District of Columbia is a federal district and not a county, the city has had a consolidated municipal government since 1871. Prior to then, Washington, Georgetown, and the unincorporated County of Washington were separate jurisdictions within the District of Columbia. Prior to 1846, when it was retroceded to Virginia, the south bank of the District of Columbia was the County of Alexandria (now the independent City of Alexandria and the County of Arlington).

==Potentially consolidated==
* Aurora, Colorado, split among three counties, explored the creation of a new consolidated city-county in 1996; the effort subsequently failed in a referendum. However, five years later, nearby Broomfield was successful in creating a new city-county from portions of the four counties it had been a part of. Encouraged by Broomfield&#x27;s experience, an Aurora city councilman again proposed consolidation in 2006. This was not accomplished in 2006 or 2007, and no bills to accomplish consolidation were introduced in the 2008 session of the Colorado legislature.
* In 2006, a proposal was made to merge Johnson County and Wyandotte County in Kansas and the cities located in those two counties into a single consolidated city-county, with the name to be determined.
* In 2005, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; in Cleveland, Ohio, published a series of articles exploring the possibility of the city&#x27;s merging with Cuyahoga County.
* Miami-Dade County, Florida, operates under a federated two-tier government, in which the county government operates as a superseding entity of county affairs and lower-tier incorporated municipalities operate civil and community services at the city level. However, the county provides city-level police, fire-rescue, sanitation, and other services under contract to many of the municipalities within its borders.
* The independent City of St. Louis, Missouri, and that of St. Louis County. The city of St. Louis seceded from the county in the 1870s and is not part of any county in the state of Missouri. Regional leaders have proposed several plans since 2006 to reunify the city and county, each one rejected by voters.

===Considered consolidation===
* Albuquerque and Bernalillo County, New Mexico, (1959, 2003)
* Baltimore and Baltimore County, Maryland: Baltimore is established in the Constitution of Maryland as an independent city. A proposed constitutional amendment to dissolve the city and merge it into Baltimore County was introduced in 1999 but was withdrawn less than a month after the first reading. Consolidation of the city and county was later proposed in 2019.
* Birmingham and Jefferson County, Alabama (1948)
*Brunswick and Glynn County, Georgia (1969, 1987)
* Buffalo and Erie County, New York
* Charleston/North Charleston/Mount Pleasant and Charleston County, South Carolina (1974)
* Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (1971)
* Des Moines and Polk County, Iowa (1994, 2004)
* Durham and Durham County, North Carolina (1961, 1974)
* El Paso and El Paso County, Texas (legislation introduced in 2005 and never considered in committee)
* Evansville and Vanderburgh County, Indiana
** Voted four times on consolidation—in 1959, 1974, 2002, and 2012. The most recent vote saw consolidation defeated by a nearly 2-to-1 margin.
* Fairbanks and Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska (2001)
* Fayetteville and Lincoln County, Tennessee (2008)
* Fort Wayne and Allen County, Indiana
* Frankfort and Franklin County, Kentucky
* Gainesville and Alachua County, Florida (1990)
* Knoxville and Knox County, Tennessee (1959, 1978, 1996)
* Las Vegas and Clark County, Nevada
* Little Rock and Pulaski County, Arkansas
* Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee (1962, 1971, 2010)
* Muncie and Delaware County, Indiana
* Oakland and Alameda County, California (1921)
* Omaha and Douglas County, Nebraska (2006, 2011)
** Movements to consolidate these two jurisdictions has been popping up since the decade of the 1900s. The 2006 proposal was approved by the Douglas County Board of Commissioners, but unanimously rejected by the Omaha City Council. The 2011 proposal was introduced by a state legislator in The Unicameral, as LB344; it was tabled in committee.
* Owensboro, Kentucky, and Daviess County, Kentucky (1990)
* Orlando and Orange County, Florida
* Paducah and McCracken County, Kentucky
** Rejected a proposed consolidation in 2012 by a more than 2-to-1 margin.
* Pensacola and Escambia County, Florida (1970)
* Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania
** Referendums passed in 1925, 1929 and 1939 that were blocked on technicalities by the state assembly. A partial consolidation of area school districts in 1956. Currently has a task-force researching consolidation since 2005.
* Portland and Multnomah County, Oregon (1927, 1974)
* Richmond (independent city) with Henrico County, Virginia (1961), although the result would be an expanded independent city of Richmond rather than a consolidated city-county.
* Roanoke County, Virginia, and the City of Roanoke, although the result would be an expanded independent city of Roanoke rather than a consolidated city-county
** held referendums in 1969 and 1990 to consolidate the two governments. Both times, city voters approved consolidation while county voters were opposed. The independent city of Salem, Virginia, which would have been surrounded by the consolidated entity, did not participate in the referendums. Vinton, Virginia would have retained its status as a town in the 1990 referendum. The consolidation issue has been dormant since 1990.
* Sacramento and Sacramento County, California (1974, 1990)
* Savannah and Chatham County, Georgia
** Prior consolidation referendum held in 1973 failed. The Georgia General Assembly is conducting a feasibility study towards consolidating the city of Savannah with Chatham County.
* St. Louis (independent city) with St. Louis County, Missouri (1926, 1962, In consideration in 2017) In 2019, a proposal to merge the city and the county was put together by a group called &quot;Better Together&quot; with support from both the County executive and mayor at the time, but the proposal was withdrawn after the St. Louis County executive Steve Stenger, who would have become mayor of a consolidated St. Louis had the consolidation happened, was indicted and pled guilty to federal corruption charges.
* Sioux Falls and Minnehaha/Lincoln counties, South Dakota (2005)
* Spokane and Spokane County, Washington (1995)
* Tallahassee and Leon County, Florida (1971, 1973, 1976, 1992)
* Tampa and Hillsborough County, Florida (1967, 1970, 1972)
* Toledo and Lucas County, Ohio
* Topeka and Shawnee County, Kansas (2005)
* Wilmington and New Hanover County, North Carolina (1933)

==Formerly consolidated==
* The City of Boston and Suffolk County, Massachusetts operated with a consolidated government for most of the twentieth century with Boston providing office space, auditors, budget, personnel and financial oversight for Suffolk County. This was not a true consolidation because three municipalities – Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop – were never annexed into Boston and remained separate jurisdictions within Suffolk County; however, the City of Boston held complete control of the county by law. The special relationship between Boston and Suffolk County ended in 1999 as part of the gradual abolition of county governments through much of the state with all county employees and powers transferred to Commonwealth of Massachusetts control. The only remaining powers and duties for the City of Boston in regards to the county is ceremonial in which the Suffolk County Register of Deeds is issued the oath of office at the start of a term as well as calls for a meeting to hold a special election to fill the office should there be a failure to elect someone to the office or should a vacancy occur.
*From the 17th century to 1898, New York City was coterminous with New York County and was often referred to as the &quot;City and County of New York&quot;. Both were coterminous with Manhattan until 1874, when the city and county annexed parts of Westchester County that would become the West Bronx, later annexing the remainder of the future Bronx. Upon consolidation in 1898, New York County was coterminous and consolidated with the boroughs of the Bronx and Manhattan, while the other boroughs were consolidated with their own respective counties. The Bronx was separated from New York County in 1914 to form its own Bronx County, and since then, each of the five boroughs of New York City is coterminous and consolidated with a county of New York state.

<text>Theatrical superstitions are superstitions particular to actors or the theatre.

==&quot;Macbeth&quot;==
William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot; is said to be cursed, so actors avoid saying its name when in the theatre (the euphemism &quot;The Scottish Play&quot; is used instead). Actors also avoid even quoting the lines from &quot;Macbeth&quot; before performances, particularly the Witches&#x27; incantations. Outside a theatre and after a performance, the play can be spoken of openly. If an actor speaks the word &quot;Macbeth&quot;, or quotes the play, in a theatre other than in performance, they must perform a ritual to remove the curse. The ritual may vary according to local custom: one is to leave the theatre building or at least the room occupied when the name was mentioned, spin around three times, spit, curse, and then knock to be allowed back in. This particular iteration of the ritual is documented in the play &quot;The Dresser&quot; and its film adaptations. 

One version of this legend claims that it was the actor who played Lady Macbeth who died during the play&#x27;s first production run and that Shakespeare himself had to assume the role. There is no evidence that this legend is factual.

==&quot;Break a leg&quot; vs. &quot;Good luck&quot;==

In America, it is considered bad luck to wish someone &quot;good luck&quot; in a theatre. Prior to performances, it is traditional for the cast to gather together to avert the bad luck by wishing each other bad luck or cursing, the expression &quot;break a leg&quot; replaces the phrase &quot;good luck&quot;. The exact origin of this expression is unknown, but some of the most popular theories are the Leg Line Theory (also known as the Curtain Theory), the Shakespearean Theory (also sometimes referred to as the Traditional Theory), and the Bowing Theory.

In Australian theatrical circles saying &quot;good luck&quot; is also avoided, but the replacement is often &quot;chookas!&quot; This may be due to the belief among some dancers that saying &quot;break a leg&quot; may actually result in broken bones. According to one oral tradition, one of the company would check audience numbers. If there were not many in the seats, the performers would have bread to eat following the performance. If the theatre was full they could then have &quot;chook&quot; —Australian slang for chicken— for dinner. Therefore, if it was a full house, the performer would call out &quot;Chook it is!&quot;, which became abbreviated to &quot;Chookas!&quot; It is now used by performers prior to a show regardless of the number of patrons; and may be a wish for a successful turnout.

Professional dancers do not wish each other good luck by saying &quot;break a leg&quot;; instead they say &quot;Merde!&quot;, the French word for &quot;shit&quot;. In turn, theater people have picked up this usage and may wish each other &quot;merde&quot;, alone or in combination with &quot;break a leg&quot;. In Spanish, the phrase is &quot;mucha mierda&quot;, or &quot;lots of shit&quot;. This term refers to the times when carriages would take the audience to the theatre. A quick look to the street in front of the venue would tell if the play was successful: a lot of horse dung on the floor indicated that many carriages had stopped to allow spectators to the theatre to alight.

Opera singers use &quot;Toi toi toi&quot;, an idiom used to ward off a spell or hex, often accompanied by knocking on wood. One explanation sees &quot;toi toi toi&quot; as the onomatopoeic rendition of spitting three times. Saliva traditionally was supposed to have demon-banishing powers and, in various cultural traditions, spitting three times over someone&#x27;s head or shoulder is a gesture to ward off evil spirits. A similar-sounding expression for verbal spitting occurs in modern Hebrew as &quot;Tfu, tfu&quot; (here, only twice), which some say that Hebrew-speakers borrowed from Russian.

An alternate operatic good luck charm, originating from Italy, is the phrase &quot;&quot;in bocca al lupo!&quot; (&quot;In the mouth of the wolf&quot;) with the response &quot;Crepi il lupo!&quot; (&quot;May the wolf die&quot;&quot;) (see &quot;Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Myth &amp; Legend&quot;).

==Ghost light==

One should always leave a light burning in an empty theatre.

Though it is a superstition, it does have practical value as well: the backstage area of a theatre tends to be cluttered with props and other objects, so someone who enters a completely darkened space is liable to be injured while hunting for a light switch.

==Ghosts in Broadway theatres==
In 2005, &quot;Playbill&quot; ran an article about Broadway theatres that were believed to be haunted. The following is a list of hauntings from that article:
* Radio City Music Hall: The Hall&#x27;s builder, Samuel Roxy Rothafel, is said to appear on opening nights accompanied by a glamorous woman spirit.
* New Amsterdam Theatre: Silent film star and former Ziegfeld Follies girl Olive Thomas is said to have appeared several times since her death in 1920. Thomas may be the most sighted ghost on Broadway, although to date she has only appeared to men. Disney, which restored the theatre in the 1990s, actively promotes the idea that Thomas haunts the theatre and makes accommodations for her presence. A large photograph of her hangs in the lobby of the New Amsterdam next to equally large photos of more famous Follies stars.
* Belasco Theatre: The top floor of the theatre is said to be haunted by its namesake David Belasco, who lived in an apartment located there.
* Palace Theatre: The former premiere vaudeville theatre is said to be haunted by more than 100 ghosts. According to the article, actress Andrea McArdle saw the ghost of a pit cellist during her 1999–2000 run as Belle in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.
* Lyric Theatre: On December 21, 1909, the ghost of playwright Clyde Fitch allegedly appeared onstage during the final curtain call on opening night for his last play, &quot;The City&quot;. He strode to center stage, took a bow, then vanished before the eyes of the startled cast and audience. (Fitch had died on September 4 of that year.) The Lyric was one of two theatres demolished in 1996 to make way for what is now called the Foxwoods Theatre.
* Al Hirschfeld Theatre: Formerly the Martin Beck Theatre, it is believed that Beck&#x27;s ghost is annoyed with the 2003 name change. During that year&#x27;s revival of &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;, there were several reports of props and other items that were mysteriously moved or went missing.

==Whistling==
Related to a similar rule for sailing ships, it is considered bad luck for an actor to whistle on or off stage. As original stage crews were hired from ships in port (theatrical rigging has its origins in sailing rigging), sailors, and by extension theatrical riggers, used coded whistles to cue scene changes. Actors who whistled could confuse them into changing the set or scenery at the wrong time and this could result in injury or death, especially if they were flying set or backdrops in or out. In today&#x27;s theatres, the stage crew normally uses an intercom or cue light system.

==Shoes on a table==
It is considered bad luck to place one&#x27;s shoes on a table.

==Miscellaneous==
* Bringing a pet (dog, cat...) on a theatrical stage set or film set or photoshoot is considered to bring bad luck to any production. “A pet on set is bad luck”. 
* Some words and phrases are used during pre-stage warm-up sessions by actors. One of these is the Western Shoshone term &quot;poo-wa-bah&quot; (possibly meaning &quot;doctor-water&quot;). This term is used notably by director Francis Ford Coppola (who talked about it in Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Apocalypse, a documentary on the making of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;) and his daughter Sofia Coppola (who is seen performing this ritual, along with her cast, in &quot;Lost on Location&quot;, a making-of documentary included as a special feature on the &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; DVD). It is thought that he began this pre-show ritual at his undergraduate alma mater Hofstra University where the tradition continues in Hofstra Drama Department productions.
* “Bad dress rehearsal, good performance.” The inverse is implied to also be true.
* Specific theatres
** Some Broadway producers have also complained about the Foxwoods Theatre (formerly known as the &quot;Hilton Theatre&quot; and &quot;Ford Center for the Performing Arts&quot;). Completed in 1998, the main complaint is that the 1829-seat theatre&#x27;s cavernous auditorium has poor sightlines and acoustics, making it difficult for audience members in distant seats to see or hear the actors. Mel Brooks (whose &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; ran for 14 months there) made a different complaint about the theatre&#x27;s acoustics, stating that its size also makes it difficult for performers to hear the laughter of the audience. The theatre opened with the two-year, 834 performance run of the original production of the musical &quot;Ragtime&quot;. This was followed in 2001 by the four-year, 1524 performance run of the revival of the musical &quot;42nd Street&quot;. Normally, this would have given the theatre a good reputation, but its poor reputation grew exponentially in 2010–11 with the seemingly endless production problems of &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot;, which had already set the record for most preview performances five months before it officially opened on 14 June 2011. See also the Lyric Theatre under &quot;Ghosts of Broadway Theatres&quot; above.
** Before &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; began its six-year, 2,017 performance run at the Mark Hellinger Theatre in 1956, that theatre was thought to be cursed. It had been switched back and forth several times between being a motion picture theatre and a live stage theatre. From its opening in 1930 until the opening of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, the 1949 musical &quot;Texas, Li&#x27;l Darlin&quot;&#x27; had the longest run at the Hellinger—nine months and 293 performances.

<doc id="299860" wikidata="Q7727210" url="?curid=299860" title="The Completion Backward Principle">
<text>The Completion Backward Principle is the fifth studio album by the American rock group the Tubes. It is the group&#x27;s first for Capitol Records. It was accompanied by a long form music video release of the same name, although it did not contain all of the songs from the album. It is a concept album presented as a motivational business document. The album contains two hit singles, &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Wait Anymore&quot; and &quot;Talk to Ya Later.&quot;

== Background ==
After the release of their fourth studio album, &quot;Remote Control&quot;, and after their time filming and recording for &quot;Xanadu&quot; and its soundtrack, The Tubes found themselves dropped by record label A&amp;M. The group spent much of 1980 searching for a new label, eventually finding Capitol Records through Bobby Colomby of Blood, Sweat, &amp; Tears. Reportedly, their three-album contract with Capitol allowed the label to drop The Tubes if any of the three records were not commercially successful. Colomby claimed the band needed a new producer in order to achieve the commercial success they had been looking for, and eventually introduced the group to David Foster. Foster, who had just come off of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&#x27;s &quot;I Am&quot;, agreed to produce the group. Some time after this, lead vocalist Fee Waybill alleges that he discovered a spoken-word motivational record from the 1950s in a record store, and used the sales pitch as the central concept to the band&#x27;s next album. “The sales technique was that ‘imagination creates reality,’ which it turns out, was a metaphor for someone like me, who grew up singing Beatles songs around the house dying to be in a band,” Waybill said in later interviews. The 2011 remaster liner notes claim keyboardist Michael Cotten instead found the record.

== Recording ==
In the liner notes of the 2011 remaster, Brett Milano asserts that the band&#x27;s approach to recording was &quot;to make an album of memorable stand-alone songs; not a soundtrack for the live show.&quot; Foster would often have input on the sound of the band&#x27;s tracks, resulting in co-writing credits for &quot;Amnesia&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Want To Wait Anymore&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Some Noise&quot;. Foster also had control over what songs were and weren&#x27;t on the album, opting to cut the track &quot;Sports Fans&quot; among others (which would later become a live staple before being included on the 2011 remaster). As well, Foster oversaw the recording process meticulously. Whereas Rundgren allowed the band to use as many takes as they needed, Foster reportedly demanded near-perfection from the group&#x27;s performances. Notorious for sending band musicians home and replacing them with session musicians if they couldn&#x27;t perform to his level, Foster initially included additional backup singers, such as Colomby and Bill Champlin.

Notable in the album&#x27;s track list is &quot;Mr. Hate&quot;, a track inspired heavily by then-alleged murderer Mark McDermand. The track was written during a time where McDermand seemed to be an innocent man, and as such the lyrics paint the character as an anti-hero as opposed to an outright villain. By 1984, McDermand had been convicted of two counts of murder. The song&#x27;s name comes from a note found at the scene of the crime for which McDermand was convicted, signed &quot;Mr. Hate.&quot;

Upon what would have been the conclusion of the recording sessions at Record One studios, Foster felt as if the album lacked a true single. The band initially suggested &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Some Noise&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With Me&quot;, but Foster instead relegated the tracks to an album cut and a B-side, respectively. Foster instead brought in Steve Lukather, guitarist for Toto. Lukather, Foster, Waybill, and The Tubes&#x27; drummer Prairie Prince reportedly recorded &quot;Talk to Ya Later&quot; in a single-day session, The title and hook was taken from engineer Humberto Gatica, who deflected the band&#x27;s questions with the phrase. To bolster the album&#x27;s single lineup, Foster also made changes to &quot;Don&#x27;t Want To Wait Anymore&quot;. An unnamed band member in the 2011 liner notes said &quot;the big choral ending that kicks your ass, that was his idea; and the modulation at the end&quot;.

== Packaging and design ==
The album was given a sleek, minimalist aesthetic, with the band only billed as &quot;Tubes&quot; on the front cover, which displayed only a T-shaped piece of PVC pipe casting a shadow on a blue background. The album&#x27;s design and packaging also parodied the growing corporatism of America, with photos of the band members wearing business suits and album notes billing them as &quot;The Tubes Group&quot;, with a slogan of &quot;credibility, growth, direction&quot;, and the performance credits including joke credits such as &quot;Analysis&quot;, &quot;Motivation&quot;, and &quot;Policy&quot;.

Printed on the back cover among the album&#x27;s song lyrics is the text for the non-album track &quot;Tubes Talk&quot;. The track is a spoken introduction (read by Fee Waybill) that preceded the non-album song &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With Me&quot; on the B-side of several regions&#x27; &quot;Talk to Ya Later&quot; single releases.

==Reception and fallout==

The album was received well by critics, and was at the time the band&#x27;s best selling and charting album. The album&#x27;s first release and first top 40 hit, &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Wait Anymore&quot;, peaked at number 35 for two weeks on the US &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; and for one week on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100. It also reached number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Talk to Ya Later&quot; hit number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It also spent five weeks on the Billboard Bubbling Under chart, peaking at number 101 and also had a music video produced for the song.

However, internally, things were tense. After &quot;Talk to Ya Later&quot; proved massively successful despite no input from the majority of the band, Foster intended to take the group in a similar direction, with the band&#x27;s following album &quot;Outside Inside&quot; featuring even more session musicians and guest writers than before, including a return appearance by Lukather. These tensions would result in the group fragmenting and temporarily disbanding in 1985 after Waybill&#x27;s debut solo album and the failure of the Rundgren-produced &quot;Love Bomb&quot;.

<doc id="299864" wikidata="Q7112948" url="?curid=299864" title="Outside Inside (The Tubes album)">
<text>Outside Inside is the sixth studio album by the Tubes, released in 1983 on Capitol Records. The album peaked at No. 18 on the US Billboard 200.

==Critical reception==
Dave Connolly of AllMusic favourably claimed &quot;producer David Foster and even more members of Toto help the Tubes punch up their new radio-ready sound with added energy. If their last record showed a newfound dancefloor sensibility, Outside Inside is absolutely funky.&quot;

==Track listing==

#&quot;She&#x27;s a Beauty&quot; (Foster, Waybill, Lukather) – 4:01
#&quot;No Not Again&quot; (Tubes) – 3:28
#&quot;Out of the Business&quot; (Tubes) – 3:30
#&quot;The Monkey Time&quot; (Curtis Mayfield, Tubes) – 3:54
#&quot;Glass House&quot; (Tubes) – 3:31

#&quot;Theme Park&quot; (Tubes) – 3:13

==Release history==

The Michele Gray version of &quot;The Monkey Time&quot; was also used on the Capitol CD issue of the album.

The album&#x27;s liner notes list the track &quot;Outside Lookin&#x27; Inside&quot; as being &quot;excerpted from a conversation with Harry James.&quot;

In 2012 Iconoclassic reissued the album with the original version of &quot;The Monkey Time&quot; featuring Davis. The reissue also included bonus tracks including B-sides that had never been previously released on CD. The CD was remastered by Vic Anesini and featured extensive liner notes and commentary from band members.

The bonus tracks include:

#&quot;When You&#x27;re Ready to Come&quot; (B-side of a single from the album)
#&quot;Keyboard Kids&quot;
#&quot;Satellite&quot; (an alternate version previously appeared on Bill Spooner&#x27;s 1985 solo album &quot;First Chud&quot;)
#&quot;The Monkey Time&quot; (single version featuring Michele Gray on vocals)

<text>Love Bomb is the seventh studio album by the Tubes, and their second to be produced by Todd Rundgren. It was released in 1985 on Capitol Records. It is the last major-label release by the Tubes.

Following the release of &quot;Love Bomb&quot;, the band broke up, with drummer Prairie Prince and keyboardist Vince Welnick joining Rundgren&#x27;s touring band. Rundgren would also record his own version of &quot;Feel It&quot; for his 1989 album &quot;Nearly Human&quot;, which also featured the two musicians.

The track, &quot;Piece By Piece&quot; was a minor hit single, peaking as high as No. 87 on the USA Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart. A music video incorporating computer and stop motion animation was also made for the track.

<doc id="299872" wikidata="Q4116108" url="?curid=299872" title="Canal Hotel bombing">
<text>The Canal Hotel bombing was a suicide truck bombing in Baghdad, Iraq, during the afternoon of 19 August 2003. It killed 23 people, including the United Nations&#x27; Special Representative in Iraq Sérgio Vieira de Mello, and wounded over 100, including human rights lawyer and political activist Amin Mekki Medani. The blast targeted the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq created just five days earlier. (The United Nations had used the hotel as its headquarters in Iraq since the early 1990s.) 
The 19 August bombing resulted in the withdrawal within weeks of most of the 600 UN staff members from Iraq. These events were to have a profound and lasting impact on the UN&#x27;s security practices globally.

The attack was followed by a suicide car bomb attack on 22 September 2003 near U.N. headquarters in Baghdad, killing a security guard and wounding 19 people.

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of terrorist organization Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, in April 2004 claimed responsibility for the 19 August blast.

==Bombing==
In his book &quot;The Prince of the Marshes&quot;, British politician and writer Rory Stewart recounts his experiences at the Canal Hotel on the day of the bombing.
The explosion occurred while Martin Barber, director of the UN&#x27;s Mine Action Service (UNMAS), was holding a press conference. The explosion damaged a spinal cord treatment center at the hospital next door and a U.S. Army Civil-Military Operations Centre located at the rear of the Canal Hotel, and the resulting shockwave was felt over a mile away.
 The blast was caused by a suicide bomber driving a truck bomb. The vehicle has been identified as a large 2002 flatbed Kamaz (manufactured in Eastern Europe and part of the former Iraqi establishment&#x27;s fleet). Investigators in Iraq suspected the bomb was made from old munitions, including a single 500-pound aerial bomb, from Iraq&#x27;s pre-war arsenal.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Humanitarian Information Centre (HIC) for Iraq (UNOHCI) was located directly beneath the office of Sérgio Vieira de Mello, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and suffered a direct hit. Of the eight staff and one visitor in the office at the time, seven were killed instantly, but de Mello and Gil Loescher were critically wounded and trapped in debris under the collapsed portion of the building. An American soldier, First Sergeant William von Zehle, crawled down through the collapsed building and worked to extricate the two men. He was joined later by another American soldier, Staff Sergeant Andre Valentine. The two men spent the next three hours trying to extricate the two survivors without benefit of any rescue equipment. Loescher was rescued after having his crushed legs amputated by the soldiers, but Vieira de Mello died before he could be removed.

According to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Vieira de Mello was specifically targeted in the blast. The reason given by al-Zarqawi for targeting Vieira de Mello was that he had helped East Timor become an independent state (see the Indonesian occupation of East Timor). Zarqawi said that Vieira de Mello had participated in the unlawful removal of territory from the Islamic Caliphate and was therefore a thief and a criminal.

==Second bomb==
The bombing was followed on September 22, 2003, by another car bomb outside the Canal Hotel. The blast killed the bomber and an Iraqi policeman and wounded 19 others, including UN workers. The second attack led to the withdrawal of some 600 UN international staff from Baghdad, along with employees of other aid agencies. In August 2004, de Mello&#x27;s replacement, Ashraf Qazi, arrived in Baghdad along with a small number of staff.

== List of victims ==
Marilyn Manuel, a member of Vieira de Mello&#x27;s staff from the Philippines, was originally listed as missing and presumed dead in the collapsed section of the building. However, she had been evacuated to an Iraqi hospital which did not notify the UN of her presence. Her survival was confirmed four days later.
==Suspects==
In an audiotape, published 6 April 2004 on a website and &quot;probably authentic,&quot; according to the CIA, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed credit for a number of attacks, including the 19 August 2003 bombing on U.N. quarters in Baghdad. By December 2004,
The Jamestown Foundation considered al-Zarqawi and his Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad responsible for the attack.

In January 2005, a top bombmaker for al-Zarqawi&#x27;s group, Abu Omar al-Kurdi, was captured by the coalition and claimed his associates made the bomb used in the attack. On 16 December 2005, Iraqi authorities issued an arrest warrant for Mullah Halgurd al-Khabir, a commander of Ansar al-Sunna, in connection with the attack.

The Italian newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; identified the suicide bomber as Algerian national Fahdal Nassim. Other suspects included Baathists, militant Sunni and Shiite groups, organized crime, and tribal elements. Blame was initially thought to lie with Ansar al-Islam, which was thought at the time to be al-Zarqawi&#x27;s group. An otherwise unknown group called the &quot;Armed Vanguards of the Second Mohammed Army&quot; claimed they were responsible for the attack.

Awraz Abd Aziz Mahmoud Sa&#x27;eed, known as al-Kurdi, confessed to helping plan the attack for al-Zarqawi. Al-Kurdi was captured by U.S. forces in 2005, judged and sentenced to death by an Iraqi court, and executed by hanging on 3 July 2007.

==Responses==

The suicide bombing of the United Nations in Baghdad drew overwhelming condemnation. Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary-General, commented that the bombing would not stop the organization&#x27;s efforts to rebuild Iraq, and said: &quot;Nothing can excuse this act of unprovoked and murderous violence against men and women who went to Iraq for one purpose only: to help the Iraqi people recover their independence and sovereignty, and to rebuild their country as fast as possible, under leaders of their own choosing.&quot;

==The World Humanitarian Day==
On 11 December 2008, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution A/63/139 on &quot;Strengthening of the Coordination of Emergency Assistance of the United Nations,&quot; which, among other declarations, designated 19 August as World Humanitarian Day to recognize all humanitarian and United Nations and associated personnel who have worked in the promotion of the humanitarian cause and those who have lost their lives while doing so.

In 2004, Gil Loescher&#x27;s daughter, documentary filmmaker Margaret Loescher, made a critically acclaimed film about her father&#x27;s experiences called &quot;Pulled from the Rubble&quot;.

A documentary produced in 2009 and a movie released in 2020, both titled &quot;Sergio&quot;, deal with the life of Sergio Vieira de Mello and the Canal Hotel bombing.

<text>The Carson Range is a spur of the Sierra Nevada in eastern California and western Nevada that starts at Carson Pass and stretches north to the Truckee River near Verdi, Nevada.

==Geography==
The mountain range is about 50 miles (80 km) long and 5–10 miles (8–16 km) wide, with 3/4 of the range lying within the state of Nevada. The Carson Range, along with its parent the Sierra Nevada,
together cast a rain shadow over the Greater Reno Area and Carson City.

Unlike the main crest of the Sierra Nevada to the west of Lake Tahoe, the Carson Range loses its snow much earlier (April), and gains it much later (December). In fact, it receives about half the snowfall as mountains west of the lake. Meltwater from the range feeds into the Truckee River and West Fork Carson River, as well as Lake Tahoe and Marlette Lake.

;Principal Mountains
==Transportation==

The western slopes of the range form the eastern shoreline of Lake Tahoe, along which US 50 and NV 28 form a partial ring road around Lake Tahoe.

Travel between Lake Tahoe and Carson City is possible via US 50 over Spooner Summit, or NV 207 over Daggett Pass. Winding through the northern half of the range lies NV 431, connecting Incline Village to Reno over Mount Rose Summit.

The Tahoe Rim Trail traverses this mountain range.

<doc id="299878" wikidata="Q122018" url="?curid=299878" title="Sinbad the Sailor">
<text>Sinbad the Sailor (; or Sindbad) is a fictional mariner and the hero of a story-cycle. He is described as hailing from Baghdad during the early Abbasid Caliphate (8th and 9th centuries A.D.). In the course of seven voyages throughout the seas east of Africa and south of Asia, he has fantastic adventures in magical realms, encountering monsters and witnessing supernatural phenomena.

==Origins and sources==

The tales of Sinbad are a relatively late addition to the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. They do not feature in the earliest 14th-century manuscript, and they appear as an independent cycle in 18th- and 19th-century collections. The tale reflects the trend within the Abbasid realm of Arab and Muslim sailors exploring the world. The stories display the folk and themes present in works of that time. The Abbasid reign was known as a period of great economic and social growth. Arab and Muslim traders would seek new trading routes and people to trade with. This process of growth is reflected in the Sinbad tales. The Sinbad stories take on a variety of different themes. Later sources include Abbasid works such as the &quot;Wonders of the Created World&quot;, reflecting the experiences of 13th century Arab mariners who braved the Indian Ocean.

The Sinbad cycle is set in the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786–809). The Sinbad tales are included in the first European translation of the Nights, Antoine Galland&#x27;s &quot;Les mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en français&quot;, an English edition of which appeared in 1711 as &quot;The new Arabian winter nights entertainments&quot; and went through numerous editions throughout the 18th century.

The earliest separate publication of the Sinbad tales in English found in the British Library is an adaptation as &quot;The Adventures of Houran Banow, etc. (Taken from the Arabian Nights, being the third and fourth voyages of Sinbad the Sailor.)&quot;, around 1770. An early US edition, &quot;The seven voyages of Sinbad the sailor. And The story of Aladdin; or, The wonderful lamp&quot;, was published in Philadelphia in 1794. Numerous popular editions followed in the early 19th century, including a chapbook edition by Thomas Tegg. Its best known full translation was perhaps as tale 120 in Volume 6 of Sir Richard Burton&#x27;s 1885 translation of &quot;The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night&quot;.

==Tales==

===Sinbad the Porter and Sinbad the Sailor===

Like the &quot;1001 Nights&quot;, the Sinbad story-cycle has a frame story which goes as follows: in the days of Harun al-Rashid, Caliph of Baghdad, a poor porter (one who carries goods for others in the market and throughout the city) pauses to rest on a bench outside the gate of a rich merchant&#x27;s house, where he complains to God about the injustice of a world which allows the rich to live in ease while he must toil and yet remain poor. The owner of the house hears and sends for the porter, finding that they are both named Sinbad. The rich Sinbad tells the poor Sinbad that he became wealthy &quot;by Fortune and Fate&quot; in the course of seven wondrous voyages, which he then proceeds to relate.

===First Voyage===

After dissipating the wealth left to him by his father, Sinbad goes to sea to repair his fortune. He sets ashore on what appears to be an island, but this island proves to be a gigantic sleeping whale on which trees have taken root ever since the whale was young. Awakened by a fire kindled by the sailors, the whale dives into the depths, the ship departs without Sinbad, and Sinbad is only saved by a passing wooden trough sent by the grace of God. He is washed ashore on a densely wooded island. While exploring the deserted island, he comes across one of the king&#x27;s grooms. When Sinbad helps save the king&#x27;s mare from being drowned by a sea horse (not a seahorse, but a supernatural horse that lives underwater), the groom brings Sinbad to the king. The king befriends Sinbad, and he rises in the king&#x27;s favor and becomes a trusted courtier. One day, the very ship on which Sinbad set sail docks at the island, and he reclaims his goods (still in the ship&#x27;s hold). Sinbad gives the king his goods and in return the king gives him rich presents. Sinbad sells these presents for a great profit. Sinbad returns to Baghdad, where he resumes a life of ease and pleasure. With the ending of the tale, Sinbad the sailor makes Sinbad the porter a gift of a hundred gold pieces and bids him return the next day to hear more about his adventures.

===Second Voyage===

On the second day of Sinbad&#x27;s tale-telling (but the 549th night of Scheherazade&#x27;s), Sinbad the sailor tells how he grew restless of his life of leisure, and set to sea again, &quot;possessed with the thought of traveling about the world of men and seeing their cities and islands.&quot; Accidentally abandoned by his shipmates again, he finds himself stranded in an island which contains roc eggs. He attaches himself with the help of his turban to a roc and is transported to a valley of giant snakes which can swallow elephants; these serve as the rocs&#x27; natural prey. The floor of the valley is carpeted with diamonds, and merchants harvest these by throwing huge chunks of meat into the valley: the birds carry the meat back to their nests, and the men drive the birds away and collect the diamonds stuck to the meat. The wily Sinbad straps one of the pieces of meat to his back and is carried back to the nest along with a large sack full of precious gems. Rescued from the nest by the merchants, he returns to Baghdad with a fortune in diamonds, seeing many marvels along the way.

===Third Voyage===

Sinbad sets sail again from Basra. But by ill chance, he and his companions are cast up on an island where they are captured by a &quot;huge creature in the likeness of a man, black of colour, ... with eyes like coals of fire and large canine teeth like boar&#x27;s tusks and a vast big gape like the mouth of a well. Moreover, he had long loose lips like camel&#x27;s, hanging down upon his breast, and ears like two Jarms falling over his shoulder-blades, and the nails of his hands were like the claws of a lion.&quot; This monster begins eating the crew, beginning with the Reis (captain), who is the fattest. (Burton notes that the giant &quot;is distinctly Polyphemus&quot;.)

Sinbad hatches a plan to blind the beast with the two red-hot iron spits with which the monster has been kebabbing and roasting the ship&#x27;s company. He and the remaining men escape on a raft they constructed the day before. However, the giant&#x27;s mate hits most of the escaping men with rocks and they are killed. After further adventures (including a gigantic python from which Sinbad escapes using his quick wits), he returns to Baghdad, wealthier than ever.

===Fourth Voyage===

Impelled by restlessness, Sinbad takes to the seas again and, as usual, is shipwrecked. The naked savages amongst whom he finds himself feed his companions a herb which robs them of their reason (Burton theorises that this might be bhang), prior to fattening them for the table. Sinbad realises what is happening and refuses to eat the madness-inducing plant. When the cannibals lose interest in him, he escapes. A party of itinerant pepper-gatherers transports him to their own island, where their king befriends him and gives him a beautiful and wealthy wife.

Too late Sinbad learns of a peculiar custom of the land: on the death of one marriage partner, the other is buried alive with his or her spouse, both in their finest clothes and most costly jewels. Sinbad&#x27;s wife falls ill and dies soon after, leaving Sinbad trapped in a cavern, a communal tomb, with a jug of water and seven pieces of bread. Just as these meagre supplies are almost exhausted, another couple—the husband dead, the wife alive—are dropped into the cavern. Sinbad bludgeons the wife to death and takes her rations.

Such episodes continue; soon he has a sizable store of bread and water, as well as the gold and gems from the corpses, but is still unable to escape, until one day a wild animal shows him a passage to the outside, high above the sea. From here, a passing ship rescues him and carries him back to Baghdad, where he gives alms to the poor and resumes his life of pleasure.

Burton&#x27;s footnote comments: &quot;This tale is evidently taken from the escape of Aristomenes the Messenian from the pit into which he had been thrown, a fox being his guide. The Arabs in an early day were eager students of Greek literature.&quot; Similarly, the first half of the voyage resembles the Circe episode in &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, with certain differences: while a plant robs Sinbad&#x27;s men of their reason in the Arab tales, it is Circe&#x27;s magic which &quot;fattened&quot; Odysseus&#x27; men in &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. It is in an earlier episode, featuring the &#x27;Lotus Eaters&#x27;, that Odysseus&#x27; men are fed a similar magical fruit which robs them of their senses.

===Fifth Voyage===

&quot;When I had been a while on shore after my fourth voyage; and when, in my comfort and pleasures and merry-makings and in my rejoicing over my large gains and profits, I had forgotten all I had endured of perils and sufferings, the carnal man was again seized with the longing to travel and to see foreign countries and islands.&quot; Soon at sea once more, while passing a desert island Sinbad&#x27;s crew spots a gigantic egg that Sinbad recognizes as belonging to a roc. Out of curiosity, the ship&#x27;s passengers disembark to view the egg. They end up breaking it and have the chick inside as a meal. Sinbad immediately recognizes the folly of their behaviour and orders all back aboard ship. However, the infuriated parent rocs soon catch up with the vessel and destroy it by dropping giant boulders they have carried in their talons.

Shipwrecked yet again, Sinbad is enslaved by the Old Man of the Sea, who rides on his shoulders with his legs twisted round Sinbad&#x27;s neck and will not let go, riding him both day and night until Sinbad would welcome death. (Burton&#x27;s footnote discusses possible origins for the old man—the orang-utan, the Greek god Triton—and favours the African custom of riding on slaves in this way).

Eventually, Sinbad makes wine and tricks the Old Man into drinking some. Sinbad kills him after he drunkenly falls off. A ship carries him to the City of the Apes, a place whose inhabitants spend each night in boats off-shore, while their town is abandoned to man-eating apes. Yet through the apes, Sinbad recoups his fortune and eventually finds a ship which takes him home once more to Baghdad.

===Sixth Voyage===

&quot;My soul yearned for travel and traffic&quot;. Sinbad is shipwrecked yet again, this time quite violently as his ship is dashed to pieces on tall cliffs. There is no food to be had anywhere, and Sinbad&#x27;s companions die of starvation until only he is left. He builds a raft and discovers a river running out of a cavern beneath the cliffs. The stream proves to be filled with precious stones and it becomes apparent that the island&#x27;s streams flow with ambergris. He falls asleep as he journeys through the darkness and awakens in the city of the king of Serendib (Sri Lanka/Ceylon), &quot;diamonds are in its rivers and pearls are in its valleys&quot;. The king marvels at what Sinbad tells him of the great Haroun al-Rashid, and asks that he take a present back to Baghdad on his behalf, a cup carved from a single ruby, with other gifts including a bed made from the skin of the serpent that swallowed an elephant (&quot;And whoso sitteth upon it never sickeneth&quot;), and &quot;A hundred thousand miskals of Sindh lign-aloesa.&quot;, and a slave-girl &quot;like a shining moon&quot;. Sinbad returns to Baghdad, where the Caliph wonders greatly at the reports Sinbad gives of Serendib.

===Seventh and Last Voyage===

The ever-restless Sinbad sets sail once more, with the usual result. Cast up on a desolate shore, he constructs a raft and floats down a nearby river to a great city. Here the chief of the merchants gives Sinbad his daughter in marriage, names him his heir, and conveniently dies. The inhabitants of this city are transformed once a month into birds, and Sinbad has one of the bird-people carry him to the uppermost reaches of the sky, where he hears the angels glorifying God, &quot;whereat I wondered and exclaimed, &#x27;Praised be God! Extolled be the perfection of God!&#x27;&quot;. But no sooner are the words out than there comes fire from heaven which all but consumes the bird-men. The bird-people are angry with Sinbad and set him down on a mountain-top, where he meets two youths, servants of God who give him a golden staff; returning to the city, Sinbad learns from his wife that the bird-men are devils, although she and her father were not of their number. And so, at his wife&#x27;s suggestion, Sinbad sells all his possessions and returns with her to Baghdad, where at last he resolves to live quietly in the enjoyment of his wealth, and to seek no more adventures.

Burton includes a variant of the seventh tale, in which Haroun al-Rashid asks Sinbad to carry a return gift to the king of Serendib. Sinbad replies, &quot;By Allah the Omnipotent, Oh my lord, I have taken a loathing to wayfare, and when I hear the words &#x27;Voyage&#x27; or &#x27;Travel,&#x27; my limbs tremble&quot;. He then tells the Caliph of his misfortune-filled voyages; Haroun agrees that with such a history &quot;thou dost only right never even to talk of travel&quot;. Nevertheless, at the Caliph&#x27;s command, Sinbad sets forth on this, his uniquely diplomatic voyage. The king of Serendib is well pleased with the Caliph&#x27;s gifts (which include, among other things, the food tray of King Solomon) and showers Sinbad with his favour. On the return voyage, the usual catastrophe strikes: Sinbad is captured and sold into slavery. His master sets him to shooting elephants with a bow and arrow, which he does until the king of the elephants carries him off to the elephants&#x27; graveyard. Sinbad&#x27;s master is so pleased with the huge quantities of ivory in the graveyard that he sets Sinbad free, and Sinbad returns to Baghdad, rich with ivory and gold. &quot;Here I went in to the Caliph and, after saluting him and kissing hands, informed him of all that had befallen me; whereupon he rejoiced in my safety and thanked Almighty Allah; and he made my story be written in letters of gold. I then entered my house and met my family and brethren: and such is the end of the history that happened to me during my seven voyages. Praise be to Allah, the One, the Creator, the Maker of all things in Heaven and Earth!&quot;.

Some versions return to the frame story, in which Sinbad the Porter may receive a final generous gift from Sinbad the Sailor. In other versions the story cycle ends here, and there is no further mention of Sinbad the Porter.

==Adaptations==

Sinbad&#x27;s quasi-iconic status in Western culture has led to his name being recycled for a wide range of uses in both serious and not-so-serious contexts, frequently with only a tenuous connection to the original tales. Many films, television series, animated cartoons, novels, and video games have been made, most of them featuring Sinbad not as a merchant who stumbles into adventure, but as a dashing dare-devil adventure-seeker.

<text>Bharata (Devanagari: भरत) was a &quot;muni&quot; (sage) of ancient India. He is traditionally attributed authorship of the influential performing arts treatise &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, which covers ancient Indian dance, dramaturgy, poetics, and music.

==Identity==
He is thought to have lived between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE.

==&quot;Nāṭya Śāstra&quot;==
Bharata is known only as being traditionally attributed authorship of the treatise &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. All other early Sanskrit treatises were similarly attributed to mythical sages. The text draws on his authority, as existing in the public imagination.

The &quot;Nāṭya Śāstra&quot; is notable as an ancient encyclopedic treatise on the performing arts, which has influenced dance, music and literary traditions in India. It is also notable for its aesthetic &quot;Rasa&quot; theory, which asserts that entertainment is the desired effect of performance arts but not the primary goal and that the primary goal is to transport the individual in the audience into another parallel reality, full of wonder, where he experiences the essence of his own consciousness and reflects on spiritual and moral questions.

<text>Manuel Arturo Odría Amoretti (26 November 1896 – 18 February 1974) was a military officer who served as the 45th President of Peru.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and military career ===
Manuel Odría was born in 1896 in Tarma, a city in the central Andes just east of Lima. He graduated first in his class from the Chorillos Military Academy in 1915. He joined the army and as a Lieutenant Colonel was a war hero in the 1941 Ecuadorian–Peruvian War. He soon achieved the rank of Major General.

=== 1948 Peruvian coup d’etat and Presidency ===

In 1945, José Bustamante had attained the presidency with the help of the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA). Soon, major disagreements arose between Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, the founder of APRA, and President Bustamante. The President disbanded his Aprista cabinet and replaced it with a mostly military one. Odría, a fierce opponent of APRA, was appointed Minister of Government and Police. In 1948, Odría and other right-wing elements urged Bustamante to ban APRA. When the President refused, Odría resigned his post. On October 27, 1948, he led a successful military coup against the government and took over as president. After two years, he resigned and had one of his colleagues, Zenón Noriega, take office as a puppet president so he could run for president as a civilian. He was duly elected a month later as the only candidate.

Odría came down hard on APRA, momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right. Like Juan Perón, he followed a populist course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, civil rights in the nation were severely restricted and corruption was rampant throughout his régime. People feared that his dictatorship would run indefinitely; they were surprised when Odría legalized opposition parties in 1956 and called fresh elections. He did not run for office. He was succeeded by a former president, Manuel Prado.

=== 1962 and 1963 general elections ===
When national elections were held again in 1962, Odría ran as a right-wing candidate for the &quot;Unión Nacional Odriista&quot; party. None of the three major candidates - Odría, Haya de la Torre and Fernando Belaúnde - received the required one third of the vote to win with a plurality. It appeared that Odría would win the Presidency in Congress, after having made a deal with Haya de la Torre, but a military coup removed President Prado from office a few days before his term ended. Elections were held again in 1963, with the same three major candidates. This time Belaúnde won with 39% of the vote.

During the Belaúnde administration, Odría made an alliance with Haya de la Torre to create a single opposition block in Parliament, which became known as the &quot;APRA-UNO Coalition&quot;. As a political force, they managed to create strong parliamentary opposition to President Belaúnde, who was forced to make important concessions to the Coalition in order to get most of his party-sponsored legislation enacted.

<doc id="299897" wikidata="Q25652" url="?curid=299897" title="Martha Reeves">
<text>Martha Rose Reeves (born July 18, 1941) is an American R&amp;B and pop singer. She is best known for being the lead singer of the Motown girl group Martha and the Vandellas, which scored over a dozen hit singles, including &quot;Come and Get These Memories&quot;, &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot;, &quot;Heat Wave&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Mack&quot;, and their signature &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;. From 2005 until 2009, Reeves served as an elected councilwoman in her hometown of Detroit, Michigan, U.S. Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Reeves at number 151 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

== Early life ==
Martha Rose Reeves was born in Eufaula, Alabama, the first daughter of Elijah Joshua Reeves and Ruby Lee Gilmore Reeves, and the third of the couple&#x27;s 11 children. She was a baby when the family moved from Eufaula to Detroit, Michigan, where her grandfather, Reverend Elijah Reeves, was a minister at Detroit&#x27;s Metropolitan Church. The family was very active in the church and its choir. Elijah played guitar, and Ruby liked to sing; the children acquired their love of music from their parents. At Detroit&#x27;s Northeastern High School, her vocal coach was Abraham Silver, who also worked with Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson (of the Supremes) and Bobby Rogers (of the Miracles). Raised on gospel, and inspired by singers like Lena Horne and Della Reese, Reeves became a fan of R&amp;B and doo-wop music. She joined the Fascinations in 1959, but left the group before they became a recording act.

== Career ==
In 1957, Reeves joined a group called the Del-Phis, with Rosalind Ashford, Gloria Williams and Annette Beard. Edward &quot;Pops&quot; Larkins formed the Del-Phis as a sister singing group to complement his male vocal group. The Del-Phis were popular local performers.

Through 1960 and 1961, Reeves made ends meet working several jobs by day and worked as a singer in nighttime hours singing jazz and blues standards at some of Detroit&#x27;s respected nightclubs. Singing at the 20 Grand, Reeves was spotted by Motown A&amp;R director Mickey Stevenson, who gave her his business card and invited her to audition. Reeves, who used the stage name Martha Lavaille showed up at Motown&#x27;s Hitsville USA studios the next morning, not knowing that she was to call to schedule an audition. Stevenson asked her to answer phones while he took care of other business. Using the skills she had learned in commercial courses in high school, Reeves answered phones, took notes, administered payroll for Motown&#x27;s Funk Brothers. (Stevenson and Reeves give a different account of this in the 2019 documentary &quot;Hitsville: The Making of Motown&quot;. Directly quoting Stevenson: &quot;She came to audition a few times. I would find nice ways of saying, &#x27;Martha, you know, come back later.&#x27;&quot; Reeves added, &quot;And I must have looked like I was gonna cry or something, cos he said, &#x27;Answer this phone. I&#x27;ll be right back.&#x27; This &quot;right back&quot; was four hours.&quot;

Before long, Reeves was working several hours at Hitsville as Stevenson&#x27;s right hand. (She also did A&amp;R work in addition to secretarial work for Motown.) By 1961, the Del-Phis had changed their name to The Vels and recorded singles for Checker and Checkmate Records. One day, when Mary Wells could not attend a session, Reeves stepped up to the microphone and called in the Del-Phis. With &quot;I&#x27;ll Have to Let Him Go&quot;, Martha and the Vandellas was born. Then, when the Andantes could not make a session to back the Miracles&#x27; drummer on songs he was recording, Martha called her groupmates. The ladies (a trio after Williams&#x27; departure) provided backup vocals for Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Stubborn Kind of Fellow&quot;. The single became a hit. Martha and the Vandellas backed Gaye on his first three singles, his first album, and on stage—even after they had their own hits.

That story is told a bit differently in the film &quot;Hitsville&quot;. According to Berry Gordy, Motown routinely recorded without a singer present, in violation of union rules: &quot;We were recording sometimes tracks without the singer, and according to the Union, you had to have a singer singing it live. You couldn&#x27;t do tracks in those days.&quot; A union representative made a surprise visit, and Berry said, &quot;Everybody went crazy, saying, &#x27;Well, you&#x27;re doing a session in there and the union guy is coming.&#x27; We told Mickey, &#x27;Man, we&#x27;ve got to put somebody on the mic.&#x27; His secretary overheard it...Then she grabbed the mic and started singing it, and she was Martha.&quot;

=== Martha and the Vandellas ===
With her brassy and gospel-reared vocals, Martha Reeves helped Martha and the Vandellas ascend from background singers with early songs such as &quot;Come and Get These Memories&quot; and &quot;Heat Wave&quot;, distinguishing the group from contemporaries and labelmates the Marvelettes, who preceded them, and the Supremes, who followed them.

After &quot;Heat Wave&quot; became the group&#x27;s first million-seller, Martha and the Vandellas quickly rose to become one of the label&#x27;s top draws both as recording stars and as a successful live act. Martha was the one consistent member of the group staying throughout all the group&#x27;s incarnations and lineups. After the exits of original members Annette Beard and Rosalind Ashford, members replacing them included Betty Kelly, Sandra Tilley (both formerly of the Velvelettes) and one of Martha&#x27;s sisters, Lois Reeves. Among the singles released that became signature hits for the group are &quot;Quicksand&quot;, &quot;In My Lonely Room&quot;, &quot;Live Wire&quot;, &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot;, &quot;A Love Like Yours (Don&#x27;t Come Knocking Everyday)&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Ready for Love&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Mack&quot;, &quot;Honey Chile&quot; and the group&#x27;s most popular single, &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;. Their television appearances included &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Where the Action Is,&quot; &quot;Shindig&quot;, &quot;Swingin&#x27; Time&quot;, &quot;Soul Train&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, and with British soul singer Dusty Springfield, on the UK show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;

The group was also featured in major magazine articles in Johnson Publishing Corp. publications including &quot;Hep&quot;, &quot;Ebony&quot; and &quot;Jet&quot;, and in the newspaper &quot;Soul&quot; and the magazine &quot;Soul Illustrated&quot;. Reeves was also an early contributing writer for &quot;Soul&quot;.

When original member Rosalind Ashford left in 1968, Reeves recruited Sandra Tilley and the lineup of Martha and Lois Reeves and Tilley continued until 1972 when the group disbanded shortly after issuing the album &quot;Black Magic&quot;. In 1972, after Motown moved from Detroit to Los Angeles, Reeves negotiated out of her contract, ending her tenure with the label.

In 1989, Reeves, Rosalind Ashford, and Annette Beard filed a lawsuit against Motown Records for royalties on the group&#x27;s records not received since 1972. The company reached a settlement with the women in 1991. Berry Gordy, Jr. apologized to Reeves for the length of time in reaching the agreement and the terms of the settlement were not made public.

=== Solo career ===

After leaving Motown and moving to Los Angeles, Reeves was signed by MCA by late 1973. Her first project, released in January 1974, was the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film &quot;Willie Dynamite&quot; with jazz trombonist J. J. Johnson. In the summer of the year, MCA released her self-titled album, produced by Richard Perry. It was reportedly the most expensive album of that time, costing $250,000, and featuring other star musicians including Billy Preston, Joe Sample and James Taylor. Despite positive reviews, it failed to generate commercial success as did Reeves&#x27; subsequent follow-ups on other labels including Arista and Fantasy. Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said, &quot;This attempted masterpiece doesn&#x27;t make it because Richard Perry has failed the fundamental test of the interpretive producer—matching performer and material. To an extent, this is Reeves&#x27;s fault—her gorgeous voice has trouble gripping complicated ideas.&quot;

She appeared as a musical guest on the first season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (hosted by Candice Bergen) in December 1975, performing the Christmas standard &quot;Silver Bells&quot; and a cover version of Jackie Wilson&#x27;s &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot;.

In Los Angeles, Reeves took acting classes at the Lee Strasberg Institute. She appeared in the movie &quot;Fairy Tales&quot; and on the television series &quot;Quincy, ME&quot;. Reeves also appeared on TV game shows such as &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. In 1977, with the help of former Motown producer Frank Wilson, Reeves became a born-again Christian, joining the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church, pastored by Reverend EV Hill. She released one album on Arista Records, working with Clive Davis, the Chairmen of the Board&#x27;s General Johnson and others, and two albums on Fantasy Records, working with other former Motown colleagues Hank Cosby and Holland, Dozier and Holland. In 1983, she performed solo on the &quot;Motown 25&quot; special. She then performed in a Broadway production of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; and reunited with original members of the Vandellas in 1989 both on record (recording for the London-based Motorcity Records that year issuing the single &quot;Step into My Shoes&quot;) and on tour. In 1995, Reeves and the Vandellas were inducted to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2003. Reeves performed as part of the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXII in 1998, with her sisters (and Vandellas), Lois and Delphine Reeves. 

In 2004, Reeves released her first album in 24 years, &quot;Home to You,&quot; with songs she wrote and produced herself except for a Billie Holiday cover and an updated version of &quot;Jimmy Mack&quot;. Between leaving the Vandellas and her solo career, Martha served as an early contributor to the music newspaper, &quot;Soul&quot;, for which she was honored for by the Black Women in Publishing organization. She was also honored for her best-selling 1995 autobiography, &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;.

&quot;Wild Night&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the feature &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;. Reeves has sometimes opened her live performances with this number. &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; is the first record played by Robin Williams’ character, Adrian Cronauer, in the movie &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot;. Her solo television appearances include &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; (1974), &quot;Soul Train&quot; (1971 and 1974), &quot;Don Kirschner&#x27;s Rock Concert&quot; (1972), &quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot; (1987) (singing &quot;Georgia On My Mind&quot; with James Brown), &quot;VH-1&#x27;s Divas Celebrate Soul&quot;, singing her 1965 hit &quot;Nowhere To Run&quot; backed by singers Marsha Ambrosius and Sharon Jones of the Dap-Kings; on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; with the Crystal Method and Brain from Nine Inch Nails, Rob Fortus from Guns N&#x27; Roses and Darryl Jones from the Rolling Stones, and on &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot; with the Temptations and Smokey Robinson. That same week she was back on the music charts with a recording entitled &quot;I&#x27;m Not Leaving&quot; with the Crystal Method. 

In January 2012, Reeves held court at London&#x27;s Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club with a sold out six-show stand that drew celebrity guests like Phil Collins and Boy George. Other recent appearances include Carnegie Hall, the Blue Note (Milan, Italy), the Howard Theater (Washington, DC), the Dakota Jazz Club (Minneapolis), BB King Blues Club (NYC), the &quot;Cheltenhem Jazz Festival&quot; and the &quot;Mouth of the Tyne Festival&quot;. In November 2015, just weeks after the terrorist bombings in Brussels and Paris, Reeves and her co-horts embarked on a sold-out tour of clubs and theatres in the city of lights and throughout Belgium.

Reeves received an honorary PhD in Humanities on November 25, 2012, in Detroit. She was inducted as a solo artists into the Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame on October 4, 2015. Reeves received the Sandy Hosey Lifetime Achievement Award at the Artists Music Guild&#x27;s 2015 AMG Heritage Awards on November 14, 2015, in Monroe, North Carolina. She is featured in Alabama&#x27;s 2016 Black History calendar, sponsored by AT&amp;T.

In August 2016, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas were presented in concert at London&#x27;s Hippodrome, where various Motown artists recorded live albums in the 1960s and 1970s.

=== Current work ===
After serving on the Detroit City Council from 2005 to 2009, Reeves returned to full-time performing with nearly 50 shows annually, including a major tour of Australia in 2010. She regularly appears at festivals in the UK during the summer, and for her performances was nominated for two UK Festival Awards, as &quot;Best Headliner&quot; and &quot;Feel Good Act of the Summer&quot;.

Reeves is a board member of SAG-AFTRA Detroit chapter. In 2007, she testified before Congress on behalf of musicians, session singers and recording artists for better wages and royalties. She was honored for her hard work and courage in 2007 by delegates and members of AFTRA. She is also on the board of SoundExchange, a non-profit performance rights organization that collects royalties on behalf of sound recording copyright owners and featured artists for non-interactive digital transmissions, including satellite and internet radio.

She made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot;, as a passer-by listening to the duo on the boardwalk. This information was revealed in the film&#x27;s DVD audio commentary by Kyle Gass.

Martha continues to perform concerts and club dates both solo and with her Vandellas—sisters Lois (Motown-era Vandella since 1967) and Delphine (since mid-1980s).

In September 2019, Martha was one of the celebrity contestants taking part on the BBC One show &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; in the UK.

In 2024, Martha received a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, with Berry Gordy Jr., Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, and others paying tribute at the event.

<text>Optical tweezers (originally called single-beam gradient force trap) are scientific instruments that use a highly focused laser beam to hold and move microscopic and sub-microscopic objects like atoms, nanoparticles and droplets, in a manner similar to tweezers. If the object is held in air or vacuum without additional support, it can be called optical levitation.

The laser light provides an attractive or repulsive force (typically on the order of piconewtons), depending on the relative refractive index between particle and surrounding medium. Levitation is possible if the force of the light counters the force of gravity. The trapped particles are usually micron-sized, or even smaller. Dielectric and absorbing particles can be trapped, too.

Optical tweezers are used in biology and medicine (for example to grab and hold a single bacterium, a cell like a sperm cell or a blood cell, or a molecule like DNA), nanoengineering and nanochemistry (to study and build materials from single molecules), quantum optics and quantum optomechanics (to study the interaction of single particles with light). The development of optical tweezing by Arthur Ashkin was lauded with the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics.

==History and development==
The detection of optical scattering and the gradient forces on micron sized particles was first reported in 1970 by Arthur Ashkin, a scientist working at Bell Labs. Years later, Ashkin and colleagues reported the first observation of what is now commonly referred to as an optical tweezer: a tightly focused beam of light capable of holding microscopic particles stable in three dimensions. In 2018, Ashkin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this development.

One author of this seminal 1986 paper, Steven Chu, would go on to use optical tweezing in his work on cooling and trapping neutral atoms. This research earned Chu the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and William D. Phillips. In an interview, Steven Chu described how Ashkin had first envisioned optical tweezing as a method for trapping atoms. Ashkin was able to trap larger particles (10 to 10,000 nanometers in diameter) but it fell to Chu to extend these techniques to the trapping of neutral atoms (0.1 nanometers in diameter) using resonant laser light and a magnetic gradient trap (cf. Magneto-optical trap).

In the late 1980s, Arthur Ashkin and Joseph M. Dziedzic demonstrated the first application of the technology to the biological sciences, using it to trap an individual tobacco mosaic virus and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; bacterium. Throughout the 1990s and afterwards, researchers like Carlos Bustamante, James Spudich, and Steven Block pioneered the use of optical trap force spectroscopy to characterize molecular-scale biological motors. These molecular motors are ubiquitous in biology, and are responsible for locomotion and mechanical action within the cell. Optical traps allowed these biophysicists to observe the forces and dynamics of nanoscale motors at the single-molecule level; optical trap force-spectroscopy has since led to greater understanding of the stochastic nature of these force-generating molecules.

Optical tweezers have proven useful in other areas of biology as well. They are used in synthetic biology to construct tissue-like networks of artificial cells, and to fuse synthetic membranes together to initiate biochemical reactions. They are also widely employed in genetic studies and research on chromosome structure and dynamics. In 2003 the techniques of optical tweezers were applied in the field of cell sorting; by creating a large optical intensity pattern over the sample area, cells can be sorted by their intrinsic optical characteristics. Optical tweezers have also been used to probe the cytoskeleton, measure the visco-elastic properties of biopolymers, and study cell motility. A bio-molecular assay in which clusters of ligand coated nano-particles are both optically trapped and optically detected after target molecule induced clustering was proposed in 2011 and experimentally demonstrated in 2013.

Optical tweezers are also used to trap laser-cooled atoms in vacuum, mainly for applications in quantum science. Some achievements in this area include trapping of a single atom in 2001, trapping of 2D arrays of atoms in 2002, trapping of strongly interacting entangled pairs in 2010, trapping precisely assembled 2-dimensional arrays of atoms in 2016 and 3-dimensional arrays in 2018. These techniques have been used in quantum simulators to obtain programmable arrays of 196 and 256 atoms in 2021 and represent a promising platform for quantum computing.

Researchers have worked to convert optical tweezers from large, complex instruments to smaller, simpler ones, for use by those with smaller research budgets.

==Physics==
===General description===
Optical tweezers are capable of manipulating nanometer and micron-sized dielectric particles, and even individual atoms, by exerting extremely small forces via a highly focused laser beam. The beam is typically focused by sending it through a microscope objective. Near the narrowest point of the focused beam, known as the beam waist, the amplitude of the oscillating electric field varies rapidly in space. Dielectric particles are attracted along the gradient to the region of strongest electric field, which is the center of the beam. The laser light also tends to apply a force on particles in the beam along the direction of beam propagation. This is due to conservation of momentum: photons that are absorbed or scattered by the tiny dielectric particle impart momentum to the dielectric particle. This is known as the scattering force and results in the particle being displaced slightly downstream from the exact position of the beam waist, as seen in the figure.

Optical traps are very sensitive instruments and are capable of the manipulation and detection of sub-nanometer displacements for sub-micron dielectric particles. For this reason, they are often used to manipulate and study single molecules by interacting with a bead that has been attached to that molecule. DNA and the proteins and enzymes that interact with it are commonly studied in this way.

For quantitative scientific measurements, most optical traps are operated in such a way that the dielectric particle rarely moves far from the trap center. The reason for this is that the force applied to the particle is linear with respect to its displacement from the center of the trap as long as the displacement is small. In this way, an optical trap can be compared to a simple spring, which follows Hooke&#x27;s law.

===Detailed view===
Proper explanation of optical trapping behavior depends upon the size of the trapped particle relative to the wavelength of light used to trap it. In cases where the dimensions of the particle are much greater than the wavelength, a simple ray optics treatment is sufficient. If the wavelength of light far exceeds the particle dimensions, the particles can be treated as electric dipoles in an electric field. For optical trapping of dielectric objects of dimensions within an order of magnitude of the trapping beam wavelength, the only accurate models involve the treatment of either time dependent or time harmonic Maxwell equations using appropriate boundary conditions.

====Ray optics====
In cases where the diameter of a trapped particle is significantly greater than the wavelength of light, the trapping phenomenon can be explained using ray optics. As shown in the figure, individual rays of light emitted from the laser will be refracted as it enters and exits the dielectric bead. As a result, the ray will exit in a direction different from which it originated. Since light has a momentum associated with it, this change in direction indicates that its momentum has changed. Due to Newton&#x27;s third law, there should be an equal and opposite momentum change on the particle.

Most optical traps operate with a Gaussian beam (TEM00 mode) profile intensity. In this case, if the particle is displaced from the center of the beam, as in the right part of the figure, the particle has a net force returning it to the center of the trap because more intense beams impart a larger momentum change towards the center of the trap than less intense beams, which impart a smaller momentum change away from the trap center. The net momentum change, or force, returns the particle to the trap center.

If the particle is located at the center of the beam, then individual rays of light are refracting through the particle symmetrically, resulting in no net lateral force. The net force in this case is along the axial direction of the trap, which cancels out the scattering force of the laser light. The cancellation of this axial gradient force with the scattering force is what causes the bead to be stably trapped slightly downstream of the beam waist.

The standard tweezers works with the trapping laser propagated in the
direction of gravity and the inverted tweezers works against gravity.
====Electric dipole approximation====
In cases where the diameter of a trapped particle is significantly smaller than the wavelength of light, the conditions for Rayleigh scattering are satisfied and the particle can be treated as a point dipole in an inhomogeneous electromagnetic field. The force applied on a single charge in an electromagnetic field is known as the Lorentz force,

::formula_1

The force on the dipole can be calculated by substituting two terms for the electric field in the equation above, one for each charge. The polarization of a dipole is formula_2 where formula_3 is the distance between the two charges. For a point dipole, the distance is infinitesimal, formula_4 Taking into account that the two charges have opposite signs, the force takes the form

::formula_5

Notice that the formula_6 cancel out. Multiplying through by the charge, formula_7, converts position, formula_8, into polarization, formula_9,

::formula_10

where in the second equality, it has been assumed that the dielectric particle is linear (i.e. formula_11).

In the final steps, two equalities will be used: (1) a vector analysis equality, (2) Faraday&#x27;s law of induction.

:# formula_12
:#formula_13

First, the vector equality will be inserted for the first term in the force equation above. Maxwell&#x27;s equation will be substituted in for the second term in the vector equality. Then the two terms which contain time derivatives can be combined into a single term.

::formula_14

The second term in the last equality is the time derivative of a quantity that is related through a multiplicative constant to the Poynting vector, which describes the power per unit area passing through a surface. Since the power of the laser is constant when sampling over frequencies much longer than the frequency of the laser&#x27;s light ~1014 Hz, the derivative of this term averages to zero and the force can be written as

::formula_15

where in the second part we have included the induced dipole moment (in MKS units) of a spherical dielectric particle: formula_16, where formula_17 is the particle radius, formula_18 is the index of refraction of the particle and formula_19 is the relative refractive index between the particle and the medium. The square of the magnitude of the electric field is equal to the intensity of the beam as a function of position. Therefore, the result indicates that the force on the dielectric particle, when treated as a point dipole, is proportional to the gradient along the intensity of the beam. In other words, the gradient force described here tends to attract the particle to the region of highest intensity. In reality, the scattering force of the light works against the gradient force in the axial direction of the trap, resulting in an equilibrium position that is displaced slightly downstream of the intensity maximum. Under the Rayleigh approximation, we can also write the scattering force as

::formula_20

Since the scattering is isotropic, the net momentum is transferred in the forward direction. On the quantum level, we picture the gradient force as forward Rayleigh scattering in which identical photons are created and annihilated concurrently, while in the scattering (radiation) force the incident photons travel in the same direction and ‘scatter’ isotropically. By conservation of momentum, the particle must accumulate the photons&#x27; original momenta, causing a forward force in the latter.

====Harmonic potential approximation====
A useful way to study the interaction of an atom in a Gaussian beam is to look at the harmonic potential approximation of the intensity profile the atom experiences. In the case of the two-level atom, the potential experienced is related to its AC Stark Shift,

::formula_21

where formula_22 is the natural line width of the excited state, formula_23 is the electric dipole coupling, formula_24 is the frequency of the transition, and formula_25 is the detuning or difference between the laser frequency and the transition frequency.

The intensity of a gaussian beam profile is characterized by the wavelength formula_26, minimum waist formula_27, and power of the beam formula_28. The following formulas define the beam profile:

::formula_29

::formula_30

::formula_31

::formula_32

To approximate this Gaussian potential in both the radial and axial directions of the beam, the intensity profile must be expanded to second order in formula_33 and formula_34 for formula_35 and formula_36 respectively and equated to the harmonic potential formula_37. These expansions are evaluated assuming fixed power.

::formula_38

::formula_39

This means that when solving for the harmonic frequencies (or trap frequencies when considering optical traps for atoms), the frequencies are given as:

::formula_40

::formula_41

so that the relative trap frequencies for the radial and axial directions as a function of only beam waist scale as:

::formula_42

===Optical levitation===
In order to levitate the particle in air, the downward force of gravity must be countered by the forces stemming from photon momentum transfer. Typically photon radiation pressure of a focused laser beam of enough intensity counters the downward force of gravity while also preventing lateral (side to side) and vertical instabilities to allow for a stable &quot;optical trap&quot; capable of holding small particles in suspension.

Micrometer sized (from several to 50 micrometers in diameter) transparent dielectric spheres such as fused silica spheres, oil or water droplets, are used in this type of experiment. The laser radiation can be fixed in wavelength such as that of an argon ion laser or that of a tunable dye laser. Laser power required is of the order of 1 Watt focused to a spot size of several tens of micrometers. Phenomena related to morphology-dependent resonances in a spherical optical cavity have been studied by several research groups.

For a shiny object, such as a metallic micro-sphere, stable optical levitation has not been achieved. Optical levitation of a macroscopic object is also theoretically possible, and can be enhanced with nano-structuring.

Materials that have been successfully levitated include Black liquor, aluminum oxide, tungsten, and nickel.

=== Optothermal tweezers ===
In the last two decades, optical forces are combined with thermophoretic forces to enable trapping at reduced laser powers, thus resulting in minimized photon damage. By introducing light-absorbing elements (either particles or substrates), microscale temperature gradients are created, resulting in thermophoresis. Typically, particles (including biological objects such as cells, bacteria, DNA/RNA) drift towards the cold - resulting in particle repulsion using optical tweezers. Overcoming this limitation, different techniques such as beam shaping and solution modification with electrolytes and surfactants were used to successfully trap the objects. Laser cooling was also achieved with Ytterbium-doped yttrium lithium fluoride crystals to generate cold spots using lasers to achieve trapping with reduced photobleaching. The sample temperature has also been reduced to achieve optical trapping for a significantly increased selection of particles using optothermal tweezers for drug delivery applications.

==Setups==

The most basic optical tweezer setup will likely include the following components: a laser (usually ), a beam expander, some optics used to steer the beam location in the sample plane, a microscope objective and condenser to create the trap in the sample plane, a position detector (e.g. quadrant photodiode) to measure beam displacements and a microscope illumination source coupled to a CCD camera.

An (1064 nm wavelength) is a common choice of laser for working with biological specimens. This is because such specimens (being mostly water) have a low absorption coefficient at this wavelength. A low absorption is advisable so as to minimise damage to the biological material, sometimes referred to as opticution. Perhaps the most important consideration in optical tweezer design is the choice of the objective. A stable trap requires that the gradient force, which is dependent upon the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective, be greater than the scattering force. Suitable objectives typically have an NA between 1.2 and 1.4.

While alternatives are available, perhaps the simplest method for position detection involves imaging the trapping laser exiting the sample chamber onto a quadrant photodiode. Lateral deflections of the beam are measured similarly to how it is done using atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Expanding the beam emitted from the laser to fill the aperture of the objective will result in a tighter, diffraction-limited spot. While lateral translation of the trap relative to the sample can be accomplished by translation of the microscope slide, most tweezer setups have additional optics designed to translate the beam to give an extra degree of translational freedom. This can be done by translating the first of the two lenses labelled as &quot;Beam Steering&quot; in the figure. For example, translation of that lens in the lateral plane will result in a laterally deflected beam from what is drawn in the figure. If the distance between the beam steering lenses and the objective is chosen properly, this will correspond to a similar deflection before entering the objective and a resulting &quot;lateral translation&quot; in the sample plane. The position of the beam waist, that is the focus of the optical trap, can be adjusted by an axial displacement of the initial lens. Such an axial displacement causes the beam to diverge or converge slightly, the result of which is an axially displaced position of the beam waist in the sample chamber.

Visualization of the sample plane is usually accomplished through illumination via a separate light source coupled into the optical path in the opposite direction using dichroic mirrors. This light is incident on a CCD camera and can be viewed on an external monitor or used for tracking the trapped particle position via video tracking.

===Alternative laser beam modes===
The majority of optical tweezers make use of conventional TEM00 Gaussian beams. However a number of other beam types have been used to trap particles, including high order laser beams i.e. Hermite-Gaussian beams (TEMxy), Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams (TEMpl) and Bessel beams.

Optical tweezers based on Laguerre-Gaussian beams have the unique capability of trapping particles that are optically reflective and absorptive. Laguerre-Gaussian beams also possess a well-defined orbital angular momentum that can rotate particles. This is accomplished without external mechanical or electrical steering of the beam.

Both zero and higher order Bessel Beams also possess a unique tweezing ability. They can trap and rotate multiple particles that are millimeters apart and even around obstacles.

Micromachines can be driven by these unique optical beams due to their intrinsic rotating mechanism due to the spin and orbital angular momentum of light.
===Multiplexed optical tweezers===
A typical setup uses one laser to create one or two traps. Commonly, two traps are generated by splitting the laser beam into two orthogonally polarized beams. Optical tweezing operations with more than two traps can be realized either by time-sharing a single laser beam among several optical tweezers, or by diffractively splitting the beam into multiple traps. With acousto-optic deflectors or galvanometer-driven mirrors, a single laser beam can be shared among hundreds of optical tweezers in the focal plane, or else spread into an extended one-dimensional trap. Specially designed diffractive optical elements can divide a single input beam into hundreds of continuously illuminated traps in arbitrary three-dimensional configurations. The trap-forming hologram also can specify the mode structure of each trap individually, thereby creating arrays of optical vortices, optical tweezers, and holographic line traps, for example. When implemented with a spatial light modulator, such holographic optical traps also can move objects in three dimensions. Advanced forms of holographic optical traps with arbitrary spatial profiles, where smoothness of the intensity and the phase are controlled, find applications in many areas of science, from micromanipulation to ultracold atoms.
Ultracold atoms could also be used for realization of quantum computers.

===Single mode optical fibers===
The standard fiber optical trap relies on the same principle as the optical trapping, but with the Gaussian laser beam delivered through an optical fiber. If one end of the optical fiber is molded into a lens-like facet, the nearly gaussian beam carried by a single mode standard fiber will be focused at some distance from the fiber tip. The effective Numerical Aperture of such assembly is usually not enough to allow for a full 3D optical trap but only for a 2D trap (optical trapping and manipulation of objects will be possible only when, e.g., they are in contact with a surface ).
A true 3D optical trapping based on a single fiber, with a trapping point which is not in nearly contact with the fiber tip, has been realized based on a not-standard annular-core fiber arrangement and a total-internal-reflection geometry.

On the other hand, if the ends of the fiber are not moulded, the laser exiting the fiber will be diverging and thus a stable optical trap can only be realised by balancing the gradient and the scattering force from two opposing ends of the fiber. The gradient force will trap the particles in the transverse direction, while the axial optical force comes from the scattering force of the two counter propagating beams emerging from the two fibers. The equilibrium z-position of such a trapped bead is where the two scattering forces equal each other. This work was pioneered by A. Constable &quot;et al.&quot;, &quot;Opt. Lett.&quot; 18,1867 (1993), and followed by J.Guck &quot;et al.&quot;, &quot;Phys. Rev. Lett.&quot; 84, 5451 (2000), who made use of this technique to stretch microparticles. By manipulating the input power into the two ends of the fiber, there will be an increase of an &quot;optical stretching&quot; that can be used to measure viscoelastic properties of cells, with sensitivity sufficient to distinguish between different individual cytoskeletal phenotypes. i.e. human erythrocytes and mouse fibroblasts. A recent test has seen great success in differentiating cancerous cells from non-cancerous ones from the two opposed, non-focused laser beams.

===Multimode fiber-based traps===
While earlier version of fiber-based laser traps exclusively used single mode beams, M. Kreysing and colleagues recently showed that the careful excitation of further optical modes in a short piece of optical fiber allows the realization of non-trivial trapping geometries. By this the researchers were able to orient various human cell types (individual cells and clusters) on a microscope. The main advantage of the so-called &quot;optical cell rotator&quot; technology over standard optical tweezers is the decoupling of trapping from imaging optics. This, its modular design, and the high compatibility of divergent laser traps with biological material indicates the great potential of this new generation of laser traps in medical research and life science. Recently, the optical cell rotator technology was implemented on the basis of adaptive optics, allowing to dynamically reconfigure the optical trap during operation and adapt it to the sample.

===Cell sorting===
One of the more common cell-sorting systems makes use of flow cytometry through fluorescence imaging. In this method, a suspension of biologic cells is sorted into two or more containers, based upon specific fluorescent characteristics of each cell during an assisted flow. By using an electrical charge that the cell is &quot;trapped&quot; in, the cells are then sorted based on the fluorescence intensity measurements. The sorting process is undertaken by an electrostatic deflection system that diverts cells into containers based upon their charge.

In the optically actuated sorting process, the cells are flowed through into an optical landscape i.e. 2D or 3D optical lattices. Without any induced electrical charge, the cells would sort based on their intrinsic refractive index properties and can be re-configurability for dynamic sorting. An optical lattice can be created using diffractive optics and optical elements.

On the other hand, K. Ladavac &quot;et al.&quot; used a spatial light modulator to project an intensity pattern to enable the optical sorting process. K. Xiao and D. G. Grier applied holographic video microscopy to demonstrate that this technique can sort colloidal spheres with part-per-thousand resolution for size and refractive index.

The main mechanism for sorting is the arrangement of the optical lattice points. As the cell flow through the optical lattice, there are forces due to the particles drag force that is competing directly with the optical gradient force (See Physics of optical tweezers) from the optical lattice point. By shifting the arrangement of the optical lattice point, there is a preferred optical path where the optical forces are dominant and biased. With the aid of the flow of the cells, there is a resultant force that is directed along that preferred optical path. Hence, there is a relationship of the flow rate with the optical gradient force. By adjusting the two forces, one will be able to obtain a good optical sorting efficiency.

Competition of the forces in the sorting environment need fine tuning to succeed in high efficient optical sorting. The need is mainly with regards to the balance of the forces; drag force due to fluid flow and optical gradient force due to arrangement of intensity spot.

Scientists at the University of St. Andrews have received considerable funding from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for an optical sorting machine. This new technology could rival the conventional fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

===Evanescent fields===
An evanescent field is a residue optical field that &quot;leaks&quot; during total internal reflection. This &quot;leaking&quot; of light fades off at an exponential rate. The evanescent field has found a number of applications in nanometer resolution imaging (microscopy); optical micromanipulation (optical tweezers) are becoming ever more relevant in research.

In optical tweezers, a continuous evanescent field can be created when light is propagating through an optical waveguide (multiple total internal reflection). The resulting evanescent field has a directional sense and will propel microparticles along its propagating path. This work was first pioneered by S. Kawata and T. Sugiura, in 1992, who showed that the field can be coupled to the particles in proximity on the order of 100 nanometers. This direct coupling of the field is treated as a type of photon tunnelling across the gap from prism to microparticles. The result is a directional optical propelling force.

A recent updated version of the evanescent field optical tweezers makes use of extended optical landscape patterns to simultaneously guide a large number of particles into a preferred direction without using a waveguide. It is termed as Lensless Optical Trapping (&quot;LOT&quot;). The orderly movement of the particles is aided by the introduction of Ronchi Ruling that creates well-defined optical potential wells (replacing the waveguide). This means that particles are propelled by the evanescent field while being trapped by the linear bright fringes. At the moment, there are scientists working on focused evanescent fields as well.

In recent studies, the evanescent field generated by mid-infrared laser has been used to sort particles by molecular vibrational resonance selectively. Mid-infrared light is commonly used to identify molecular structures of materials because the vibrational modes exist in the mid-infrared region. A study by Statsenko et al. described optical force enhancement by molecular vibrational resonance by exciting the stretching mode of Si-O-Si bond at 9.3 μm. It is shown that silica microspheres containing significant Si-O-Si bond move up to ten times faster than polystyrene microspheres due to molecular vibrational resonance. Moreover, this same group also investigated the possibility of optical force chromatography based on molecular vibrational resonance.

Another approach that has been recently proposed makes use of surface plasmons, which is an enhanced evanescent wave localized at a metal/dielectric interface. The enhanced force field experienced by colloidal particles exposed to surface plasmons 
at a flat metal/dielectric interface has been for the first time measured using a photonic force microscope, the total force magnitude being found 40 times stronger compared to a normal evanescent wave. By patterning the surface with gold microscopic islands it is possible to have selective and parallel trapping in these islands. The forces of the latter optical tweezers lie in the femtonewton range.

The evanescent field can also be used to trap cold atoms and molecules near the surface of an optical waveguide or optical nanofiber.

===Indirect approach===
Ming Wu, a UC Berkeley Professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences invented the new optoelectronic tweezers.

Wu transformed the optical energy from low powered light emitting diodes (LED) into electrical energy via a photoconductive surface. The idea is to allow the LED to switch on and off the photoconductive material via its fine projection. As the optical pattern can be easily transformable through optical projection, this method allows a high flexibility of switching different optical landscapes.

The manipulation/tweezing process is done by the variations between the electric field actuated by the light pattern. The particles will be either attracted or repelled from the actuated point due to its induced electrical dipole. Particles suspended in a liquid will be susceptible to the electrical field gradient, this is known as dielectrophoresis.

One clear advantage is that the electrical conductivity is different between different kinds of cells. Living cells have a lower conductive medium while the dead ones have minimum or no conductive medium. The system may be able to manipulate roughly 10,000 cells or particles at the same time.

See comments by Professor Kishan Dholakia on this new technique, K. Dholakia, &quot;Nature Materials&quot; 4, 579–580 (01 Aug 2005) News and Views.

&quot;The system was able to move live E. coli bacteria and 20-micrometre-wide particles, using an optical power output of less than 10 microwatts. This is one-hundred-thousandth of the power needed for [direct] optical tweezers&quot;.

Another notably new type of optical tweezers is optothermal tweezers invented by Yuebing Zheng at The University of Texas at Austin. The strategy is to use light to create a temperature gradient and exploit the thermophoretic migration of matter for optical trapping. The team further integrated thermophoresis with laser cooling to develop opto-refrigerative tweezers to avoid thermal damages for noninvasive optical trapping and manipulation.

===Optical binding===
When a cluster of microparticles are trapped within a monochromatic laser beam, the organization of the microparticles within the optical trapping is heavily dependent on the redistributing of the optical trapping forces amongst the microparticles. This redistribution of light forces amongst the cluster of microparticles provides a new force equilibrium on the cluster as a whole. As such we can say that the cluster of microparticles are somewhat bound together by light. One of the first experimental evidence of optical binding was reported by Michael M. Burns, Jean-Marc Fournier, and Jene A. Golovchenko, though it was originally predicted by T. Thirunamachandran. One of the many recent studies on optical binding has shown that for a system of chiral nanoparticles, the magnitude of the binding forces are dependent on the polarisation of the laser beam and the handedness of interacting particles themselves, with potential applications in areas such as enantiomeric separation and optical nanomanipulation.

===Fluorescence optical tweezers===
In order to simultaneously manipulate and image samples that exhibit fluorescence, optical tweezers can be built alongside a fluorescence microscope. Such instruments are particularly useful when it comes to studying single or small numbers of biological molecules that have been fluorescently labelled, or in applications in which fluorescence is used to track and visualize objects that are to be trapped.

This approach has been extended for simultaneous sensing and imaging of dynamic protein complexes using long and strong tethers generated by a highly efficient multi-step enzymatic approach and applied to investigations of disaggregation machines in action.

=== Tweezers combined with other imaging techniques ===
Other than &#x27;standard&#x27; fluorescence optical tweezers are now being built with multiple color Confocal, Widefield, STED, FRET, TIRF or IRM.

This allows applications such as measuring: protein/DNA localization binding, protein folding, condensation, motor protein force generation, visualization of cytoskeletal filaments and motor dynamics, microtubule dynamics, manipulating liquid droplet (rheology) or fusion. These setups are difficult to build and traditionally are found in non correlated &#x27;academic&#x27; setups. In the recent years even home builders (both biophysics and general biologists) are converting to the alternative and are acquiring total correlated solution with easy data acquisition and data analysis.

<text>A Bachelor of Laws (; LL.B.) is an undergraduate law degree offered in most common law countries as the primary law degree and serves as the first professional qualification for legal practitioners. This degree requires the study of core legal subjects and jurisprudence to provide a comprehensive understanding of the legal system and its function. The LLB curriculum is designed to impart a thorough knowledge of legal principles, legal research skills, and a sound understanding of the roles and responsibilities of lawyers within society. This degree is often a prerequisite for taking bar exams or qualifying as a practising lawyer, depending on the jurisdiction. Additionally, the LLB program also serves as a foundation for further legal education, such as a Master of Laws (LLM) or other postgraduate studies in law.

== Region awarded ==
Bachelor of Laws degrees are awarded by universities in regions including Europe, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, New Zealand, Nigeria, Singapore, South Africa, Botswana, Brazil, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and United Kingdom. In the United States, the Bachelor of Laws was the primary law degree until the 1960s, when it was phased out in favor of the Juris Doctor; Canada followed suit in the early 21st century.

==History==
The first academic degrees were all law degrees in medieval universities, and the first law degrees were doctorates. The foundations of the first universities were the glossators of the 11th century, which were also schools of law. The first university, that of Bologna, was founded as a school of law by four famous legal scholars in the 12th century who were students of the glossator school in that city. The University of Bologna served as the model for other law schools of the medieval age. While it was common for students of law to visit and study at schools in other countries, such was not the case with England because of the English rejection of Roman law (except for certain jurisdictions such as the Admiralty Court). Although the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge did teach canon law until the English Reformation, its importance was always superior to civil law in those institutions.

&quot;LLB&quot; stands for in Latin. The &quot;LL.&quot; of the abbreviation for the degree is from the genitive plural (&quot;of laws&quot;). Creating an abbreviation for a plural, especially from Latin, is often done by doubling the first letter (e.g., &quot;pp.&quot; for &quot;pages&quot;). 

The bachelor&#x27;s degree originated at the University of Paris, whose system was implemented with the Bachelor of Arts degree at Oxford and Cambridge. The &quot;arts&quot; designation of the degree traditionally signifies that the student has undertaken a certain amount of study of the classics. In continental Europe, the bachelor&#x27;s degree was phased out in the 18th or early 19th century but it continued at Oxford and Cambridge.

The teaching of law at Oxford University was for philosophical or scholarly purposes and not meant to prepare one to practise law. Professional training for practising common law in England was undertaken at the Inns of Court, but over time the training functions of the Inns lessened considerably and apprenticeships with individual practitioners arose as the prominent medium of preparation. However, because of the lack of standardisation of study and of objective standards for appraisal of these apprenticeships, the role of universities became subsequently of importance for the education of lawyers in the English speaking world.

In England in 1292, when Edward I requested that lawyers be trained, students merely sat in the courts and observed, but over time the students would hire professionals to lecture them in their residences, which led to the institution of the Inns of Court system. The original method of education at the Inns of Court was a mix of moot court-like practice and lecture, as well as court proceedings observation. By the seventeenth century, the Inns obtained a status as a kind of university akin to the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, though very specialised in purpose. With the frequent absence of parties to suits during the Crusades, the importance of the lawyer role grew tremendously, and the demand for lawyers grew.

Traditionally Oxford and Cambridge did not see common law as worthy of study, and included coursework in law only in the context of canon and civil law and for the purpose of the study of philosophy or history only. The apprenticeship programme for solicitors thus emerged, structured and governed by the same rules as the apprenticeship programmes for the trades. The training of solicitors by apprenticeship was formally established by an act of parliament in 1729. William Blackstone became the first lecturer in English common law at the University of Oxford in 1753, but the university did not establish the programme for the purpose of professional study, and the lectures were philosophical and theoretical in nature. Blackstone insisted that the study of law should be university based, where concentration on foundational principles can be had, instead of concentration on detail and procedure had through apprenticeship and the Inns of Court.

The Inns of Court continued but became less effective, and admission to the bar still did not require any significant educational activity or examination. Therefore, in 1846, Parliament examined the education and training of prospective barristers and found the system to be inferior to the legal education provided in the United States. Therefore, formal schools of law were called for, but not finally established until later in the century, and even then the bar did not consider a university degree in admission decisions. When law degrees were required by the English bar and bar associations in other common law countries, the LLB became the uniform degree for lawyers in common law countries.

==Common law programs==
In most common law countries (with the exceptions of all Canadian provinces except Quebec, and the United States), the Bachelor of Laws programme is generally entered directly after completion of secondary school.

===England and Wales===
The LLB is an undergraduate course. In England and Wales it is also possible to study a programme for conversion called the Graduate Diploma in Law which allows entry to the legal profession following completion of a previous undergraduate degree unrelated to law, which entitles graduates to take the vocational courses for entry into the legal profession.

===Scotland===
Although Scotland has a mixed legal system, with both civil and common law influences, the undergraduate LLB is the primary route into the legal profession. The Scots Law LLB is generally taken as a four-year honours course, similar to other university degrees in Scotland. Students wishing to satisfy the Law Society of Scotland requirements to become a solicitor must also complete the postgraduate Diploma in Professional Legal Practice at an approved university.

===Australia===
A qualifying law degree for the purposes of admission as a lawyer in Australia is either the undergraduate LLB program at accredited universities, or the graduate JD (Juris Doctor). Every recognised qualification of each state admission board is reciprocally recognised by all other states. However, prior to degrees, there existed an alternative to a degree to become a lawyer in Australia, which was either the Barrister&#x27;s Admission Board, or the Solicitor&#x27;s Admission Board, whose examinations rendered one eligible to be admitted respectively. The successor of these boards that still operates the alternative is the Legal Profession Admission Board, which issues the distinct Diploma in Law, equivalent to either an LLB or a JD Law degrees typically last 4 years for undergraduate admission or 3 years for university graduates.

Of the thirty-eight law schools, thirteen of those universities have also started offering the Juris Doctor as a graduate-entry degree.

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, obtaining an LLB degree is a prerequisite for practising as an advocate in a court of law. Both LLB and LLB (Hons.) degrees are offered at public and private universities. Only seven public universities offer LLB (Hons.) degree. Some private universities also offer four-year LLB (Hons.) degrees and one-year LLM courses. The National University of Bangladesh also offers a two-year LLB degree to graduates of subjects other than law. The University of Rajshahi is the first institute in South Asia to offer a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law, originally offering the B. Jur. (Bachelor of Jurisprudence) beginning in 1970. Later on, the program was replaced with an LL. B (Hons.) program. 

===Canada===

Canada has two legal systems. The Province of Quebec uses a civil law system. At the federal level, as well as in every province or territory except Quebec, a system of common law is used. Because of this, there are two types of Canadian law degrees generally in use.

==== Common law ====
The programme of study for common law has traditionally been an undergraduate LLB degree, which has now been re-designated as a JD at nearly all Canadian common law schools. Entrants to the JD programme generally hold an undergraduate degree before registration in the law programme and a significant number hold a graduate-level degree as well. However, admission may be granted to applicants with two years of undergraduate studies towards a degree. Unlike the United States, the JD is considered a bachelor&#x27;s degree-level qualification, albeit a &quot;second-entry&quot; one. The common law programme is three years in length. Upon graduation, one holds a Bachelor of Laws or Juris Doctor degree. To practise law, the graduate must obtain a licence from the Law Society of the province where they wish to practise law, which requires a year of articling.

==== Civil law ====
The civil law programme in Canada is three years in length. The programme of study for the first degree in Quebec civil law (called LLB, BCL, or LLL) is a first-entry degree programme. Like other first-entry university programmes in Quebec, it requires a college diploma for entry. Law schools that offer civil law BCL, LLB, or LLL degrees include McGill University, Université de Montréal, Université du Québec à Montréal, Université de Sherbrooke, Université Laval and the University of Ottawa.

==== Bijuridical ====
Because of Canada&#x27;s dual system of laws, some law schools offer joint or dual degrees in common law and civil law: McGill University, Université de Montréal, Université de Sherbrooke and the University of Ottawa. The law degree offered by McGill University is a mandatory joint common law LLB and Quebec civil law BCL degree. The programme is four years in length. Admission to that programme is a first-entry programme in the case of Quebec students while it is a second-entry programme in the case of students from other provinces (since two years of university studies is required). The University of Ottawa offers a civil law degree (LLL) on its own.

A number of Canadian law schools allow holders of baccalaureate degrees in Quebec civil law to earn the LLB in common law in two or three semesters. Similarly, the University of Ottawa offers a one-year LLL programme in Quebec civil law for holders of an LLB or JD degree in common law from a Canadian law school.

Additionally, some Canadian universities with &quot;common law&quot; law schools have an arrangement with a Canadian university with a &quot;Quebec civil law&quot; law school enabling students to obtain the home school&#x27;s law degree in three years and the exchange school&#x27;s law degree in the fourth year.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, three universities, including The University of Hong Kong, Chinese University of Hong Kong, and City University of Hong Kong, provide legal studies with both LLB degree or JD degree. The LLB is 4 years in length, while JD is 2 years. Students who have an LLB or JD degree, whether conferred by local universities or the accredited universities overseas, are eligible to apply for admission to PCLL, the legal qualification programme in Hong Kong.

===India===


In India, legal education is traditionally offered as a three-year graduate degree conferring the title of Bachelor of Laws, requiring prospective students to have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in any subject from a recognised institution.

However, specialised universities of law known as National Law Universities solely devoted to legal education offer an undergraduate five-year law course for students that have completed Class XII from a recognised board of education in India. The five-year law course leads to an integrated honours degree combining the LLB degree with another bachelor&#x27;s degree, such as a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Social Work. In these programs, students are taught subjects associated with the additional non-law bachelor&#x27;s degree during the first two years, in addition to standard legal subjects such as torts, contracts and constitutional law, such as social sciences for the Bachelor of Arts and a combination of physical, life and applied sciences for the Bachelor of Science. In the latter three years of all these programmes, legal subjects dominate the curriculum.

The first national law school was the National Law School of India University. This was followed by others, including the Nalsar University of Law and West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences. Today, many Indian universities offer five-year integrated BA LLB programmes similar to that of the national law schools of India, while others continue to offer a traditional three-year programme. Both integrated and traditional types of three-year law degrees are recognised by the Bar Council of India for to qualify for enrolment to the Bar. One needs to have a full-time law degree to practice as a lawyer in India. Distance or online education options are not available to become a practising lawyer in India.

===Malaysia===
Malaysia inherited a common law system from the British colonial period. However, unlike the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, Malaysia adopted the fused legal profession with legal practitioners acting both as solicitors and in a way &quot;barristers&quot;. Hence all are lawyers eligible and can be admitted to the High Court as a legal professional is entitled to be bestowed with the title &quot;Advocate &amp; Solicitor&quot;. This applies to both lawyers practising in the Peninsular Malaysia (Malaya) and the States of Sabah &amp; Sarawak.

Under the Legal Profession Act 1976, a person is deemed to be a qualified person to be admitted as an Advocate &amp; Solicitor if they completed and passed the course of Bar Vocational Course in UK &amp; Wales from any Inns of Court, passed the Certificate in Legal Practice or completed a 4-year LLB (Honours) course from an accredited Malaysian university.

===New Zealand===
An LLB is required to practise law in New Zealand. An LLB typically takes four years to complete, although it is often completed concurrently with another degree, such as a Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.) or Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), with the combined completion time usually being five years. Most New Zealand universities allow graduates of other degrees to complete an LLB in three years. Six New Zealand universities offer the LLB degree.
===Pakistan===
Pakistan is a common law country and to become a lawyer in Pakistan, one needs an LLB from a Pakistani or a foreign university from common law country recognised by the Pakistan Bar Council. Lawyers in Pakistan are called &quot;advocates&quot;. An advocate has to be member of one of the provincial Bar Councils, i.e., Punjab Bar Council, Sindh Bar Council, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council, Balochistan Bar Council or the Islamabad Bar Council.

The Bachelor of Laws obtained from universities in Pakistan consists of a 5-year B.A.-LLB qualification. This rule was laid down by the Pakistan Bar Council in 2016 requiring 5 years of education to obtain a Bachelor of Laws qualification. This change in the legal education rules led to the abolishing of 3 year LLB programs being offered by universities in Pakistan. This rule however does not affect the recognition of LLB degrees of less than 5 years obtained from foreign universities recognised by the Pakistan Bar Council for the purposes of enrolling as an advocate in Pakistan.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the LLB is an undergraduate degree conferred by three universities: the National University of Singapore (NUS), the Singapore Management University (SMU), and the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). Graduate JD courses are also available at all three law schools. To be called to the Singapore Bar, graduates are minimally required to possess an LLB or JD from a recognised university.

===South Africa===
In South Africa the LLB is offered both at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. As of 1996 it is the universal and only legal qualification for legal practice, superseding the existing B.Juris. and B.Proc. degrees. The undergraduate programme, offered since 1998, requires four years of study. At the postgraduate level, the programme generally requires three years. Several South African universities offer Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Commerce degrees with a major in &quot;Law&quot;; graduates may then undertake a two-year postgraduate-programme. Some universities also offer a one-year programme for holders of the B.Proc. degree.

The curriculum is typically structured around preliminary, core and advanced courses, and most universities also offer elective coursework. The preliminary courses acquaint the students with both the background and the foundations of the South African legal system, and with legal thinking and analysis in general. The core subjects are those regularly required for legal practice. 
The advanced courses (usually) comprise further study in these core subjects, deepening and / or broadening the student&#x27;s knowledge as appropriate. The electives – often comprising these advanced courses, amongst others – allow students to specialise in a particular area of law, to an extent, by choosing from a range of optional courses. Some universities also require that students complete an experience based course (&quot;Practical Legal Studies&quot; / &quot;Law clinic&quot;); a credit comprising independent research exclusively is often offered as an elective, and at some universities is a degree requirement.

Depending on university, the curriculum will comprise legal subjects exclusively, or may include humanities subjects so as to prepare graduates with a &quot;broad-based&quot; legal education. Some undergraduate programmes do not offer any optional coursework. Credits in English and Afrikaans are also often included. Along with Latin, these were, but are no longer, &quot;subjects compelled by statute&quot;, and were typically entrance requirements for the LLB, having been studied as undergraduate modules. Similarly, Roman Law was previously a preliminary course, whereas, in both the post- and undergraduate degree, it is now offered as an elective.

The structure of the undergraduate programme is under review. The issues noted are: graduates of these programmes are seen to be less prepared for the profession as compared to those pursuing the graduate LLB; only 20% of entrants complete the programme within four years; only about 50% of graduates here enter the legal profession at all. Further, there are those who question the academic standard of the new degree. Some universities have now discontinued the programme; in other cases undergraduate students are required to initially register as Arts, Commerce or Science students – with first year law subjects – and, in the second year of study, only those meeting specified criteria may choose to pursue the four-year LLB.

==Alternative titles and formats==

===Irish BCL and LLB===
The four universities under the National University of Ireland umbrella, award the degree of Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL). Four Irish universities and two Northern Irish universities award an LLB NUIG offer the LLB as a 1-year postgraduate course for holders of the Bachelor of Corporate Law or Bachelor of Arts in law degrees.

Some English and Welsh universities award an LLB in Irish law. 

In the nineteenth century, the University of London conferred degrees of LLB on clerical and lay students at St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Carlow from 1840 onwards.

The King&#x27;s Inns Barrister-at-Law degree B.L. is a postgraduate degree and is required to practice as a barrister in Ireland.

===Zimbabwe B.L. and LLB===
At the University of Zimbabwe, the first degree in common law was the Bachelor of Laws (BL), which was equivalent to the LLB in other common law jurisdictions. It was followed by a one-year programme at the university (analogous to post-LLB vocational programmes in other common law jurisdictions) at the end of which a second degree, the Bachelor of Laws (LLB), was awarded. The curriculum has since been changed and now only one four-year honours LLB degree is awarded.

===Variations on the LLB===
Some universities in the United Kingdom and New Zealand offer variations, which generally take four years to complete and include a wider range of topics as well as some degree of specialisation or the study of multiple jurisdictions, such as the LLB Law with French Law and Language offered by the University of East Anglia.

Various universities in the United Kingdom and Australia will allow a degree that combines study with a non-law discipline. For example, some universities in the United Kingdom offer a combined study of law and history leading to a B.A. degree that is accepted by the Law Society and Inns of Court as equivalent to an LLB. 

The University of London External Programme in Laws (LLB) has been awarding its law degree via distance learning since 1858.

At the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the principal law degree remains the Bachelor of Arts, in either Jurisprudence or Law, which is equivalent to an LLB in other universities. Traditionally, the LLB at Cambridge, as well as the Bachelor of Civil Law at Oxford, were postgraduate degrees for specialising in law. The University of Cambridge, recently, replaced their LLB title with that of the LLM, which Oxford retains the BCL as a master&#x27;s level course, equivalent to the LLM.

Some universities in the UK including Bournemouth University have a four-year LLB course, which consists of a 40-week industrial work placement. Staffordshire University also offers a two-year full-time LLB course.

LLB programs in syaria and common law have been introduced by some universities in Pakistan and Malaysia.

==United States==
The United States no longer offers the LLB, though some universities have introduced bachelor&#x27;s degrees in legal studies, featuring curricula that include courses in constitutional law, tort law, and criminal law. These degrees may provide an accelerated pathway into the JD program, allowing students to complete both degrees in six instead of seven years.

While the LLB was conferred until 1971 at Yale University, since that time, all universities in the United States have awarded the professional doctorate JD, which then became the generally standardised degree in most states as the compulsory prerequisite to sit for the bar exam prior to practice of law. Many law schools converted their basic law degree programmes from LLB to JD in the 1960s, and permitted prior LLB graduates to retroactively receive the new doctorate degrees by returning their LLB in exchange for a JD degree. Yale graduates who received LLB degrees prior to 1971 were similarly permitted to change their degree to a JD, though many did not take the option, choosing to retain their LLB degrees.

Before the degree was phased out, notable recipients of the LLB include former United States presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and William Howard Taft; former United States Supreme Court Justices Earl Warren, Anthony Kennedy, William Rehnquist, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Thurgood Marshall, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor and Stephen Breyer; former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover; American judge and jurist Richard Allen Posner; as well as the first female commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, Frieda B. Hennock.

===Eligibility of foreign graduates in the US===
For the most part, foreign law graduates seeking admission to the bar in the United States will find their law degree does not itself fulfill the core admission requirements of most states, thereby not allowing them to take the bar exam. The major exception to this is New York, where those foreign graduates who have fulfilled the educational requirements to practice law in another common law country through study at an approved educational institution, similar in both duration and content to the equivalent teaching at an approved United States law school, are permitted to sit for the bar exam. Additionally, both New York and Massachusetts permit Canadian LLB holders to take the bar exam. The requirements of each of the states vary, and in some states sufficient years of practice in one&#x27;s home country may allow for those otherwise excluded to sit for the bar exam.

Most states require completion of a law degree from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association. As a result, some American law schools offer one-year LLM programmes for foreign attorneys, which qualify foreign lawyers for admission to some state bars.

==European LLB programs==
European Union law permits European Union citizens with LLB degrees from one EU member state, who practise law and have been qualified lawyers in their jurisdiction for three or more years, to practise also in every other member state. The actual procedure to receive the respective national licence is regulated by the member state and therefore differs from country to country, and temporary restrictions may in certain cases exist, but every EU member has to apply the relevant EU Directives to its own national law.

As a consequence of the Bologna Process, recently many universities of applied sciences and a few traditional universities in Germany have introduced LLB programmes, replacing the degree. The LLB is a three or four-year full-time law degree. As opposed to courses of study leading to the State Examination—the master&#x27;s-level professional law degree in Germany—most LLB degree programmes concentrate on private law and may feature a component of education in business administration. Graduates of LLB courses can continue LLM studies and in some cases sit for the first State Examination after one or more years of additional law studies in order to qualify for practising law in Germany.

In Malta, the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree, offered by the University of Malta, is an undergraduate degree that of itself is not sufficient for admission into any of the legal professions. Likewise, in Italy a five-year course in law (&quot;Laurea magistrale in giurisprudenza a ciclo unico&quot;) is offered by law schools. The Italian Diploma in Law, equivalent to the LLB, does not directly qualify one for a career in any legal profession, as graduates are required to undergo a traineeship for 18 months before taking a government exam to sit for the Italian bar or take the exam as public notary. Alternatively, this requirement can be met by undertaking two further year of studies (&quot;Diploma di specializzazione per le professioni legali&quot; – equivalent of a 2-year Master of Arts).

In Spain, there is no comparable degree to the LLB Law studies in Spain last for four years in total, culminating in the &quot;Grado en Derecho&quot;. Prior to that, the sole degree of &quot;Licenciatura en Derecho&quot; allowed graduates of law direct access to the legal profession without further training and masters. Currently, holders of a Spanish law degree must attend a specific LLM in Legal practice course (similar to the former British LPC) to gain admission to the Spanish bar.

In Denmark, universities now offer three-year LLB programmes, although this is not sufficient to practice law. Students wishing to practice law should continue with a Masters in Law programme, leading to the cand.jur. degree. Alternatively, students may choose to use the LLB as a basis for other courses within the social sciences or humanities.

Daniel Odier began studies at the school of Beaux Arts in Rome but later chose to focus on writing rather than painting. He received his university degree in Paris and was employed by a leading Swiss newspaper as a music critic. He has taught screenwriting at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma.

Fascinated by Chan (the Chinese origin of zen), Daniel Odier decided to study the proximity of Chan and Tantra, inspired by the work of the Chinese hermit Chien Ming Chen, whom he met in Kalimpong in 1968. Also in 1968, Daniel Odier became a disciple of Kalu Rinpoche for seven years; he received transmission of the Mahamudra from his master.

In 1975, he met a Kashmiri Shivaïte yogini called Lalitâ Devî in a Himalayan hermitage, a decisive meeting which he recounts in his various works on Tantra. He received the transmission of Mahamudra and of the mystical teachings of the Pratyabhijñā and Spanda schools of the Kaula tradition from Lalitâ Devî. He then specialized in Kashmiri Shaivism, which he taught in several countries (France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, United States ...).

In 1995, Daniel Odier founded the &quot;Tantra/Chan centre&quot; in Paris, which he dissolved in 2000 in order to encourage independent spiritual practice. He has taught courses on Eastern spiritual traditions at the University of California.

In 2004, he received dharma transmission from Jing Hui, abbot of Bailin Monastery and dharma successor of Hsu Yun, using the name &quot;Ming Qing&quot;.

Daniel Odier is most of all a teacher of Kashmir Shaivism; he relates in his book &quot;Tantric Quest&quot; his mystical initiation from a tantric dakini, Lalita Devi, in Kashmir.

He was married to the violinist Nell Gotkovsky (died 1998).

==Works==
Apart from his works on Tantra, Odier is best known for a series of six novels published under the pseudonym &#x27;Delacorta.&#x27; The books center around Serge Gorodish, a classically trained pianist with depressive tendencies, and his underage protégée named Alba. The two enjoy an intense romantic relationship (never actually consummated), and embark together upon various confidence schemes and other intrigues. These often result in the death or discomfiture of less sympathetic characters, although Alba and Gorodish themselves appear to be motivated more by their own profit and amusement than by any moral considerations. The series includes the novel &quot;Diva&quot; which was later used as the basis for a popular French film of the same name. Odier has also used the Delacorta pseudonym for several unrelated books (mostly detective novels or thrillers) and as a screenwriter. The Alba/Gorodish books have appeared in omnibus editions in French and have been published in numerous other languages. Most of Odier&#x27;s other fiction remains untranslated.

In addition to &quot;Diva&quot;, film adaptations of Odier&#x27;s books include &quot;Light Years Away&quot; (from the novel, &quot;La voie sauvage&quot;) and a French television film based on the Delacorta novel &quot;Rock&quot; (&quot;Lola&quot;). Odier&#x27;s own screenwriting credits include the films &quot;Invitation au voyage&quot; (1982) and &quot;Celestial Clockwork&quot; (1995).

<doc id="299920" wikidata="Q1779729" url="?curid=299920" title="Legal formalism">
<text>Legal formalism is both a descriptive and normative theory of how judges should decide cases. In its descriptive sense, formalists maintain that judges reach their decisions by applying uncontroversial principles to the facts; formalists believe that there is an underlying logic to the many legal principles that may be applied in different cases. These principles, they claim, are straightforward and can be readily discovered by anyone with some legal expertise. US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., by contrast, believed that &quot;The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience&quot;. The formalist era is generally viewed as having existed from the 1870s to the 1920s, but some scholars deny that legal formalism ever existed in practice.

The ultimate goal of legal formalism would be to describe the underlying principles in a single and determinate system that could be applied mechanically—from which the term &quot;mechanical jurisprudence&quot; comes. The antithesis of formalism is legal realism, which has been said to be &quot;[p]erhaps the most pervasive and accepted theory of how judges arrive at legal decisions.&quot;

This descriptive conception of &quot;legal formalism&quot; can be extended to a normative theory, which holds that judges should decide cases by the application of uncontroversial principles to the facts; &quot;sound legal
decisions can be justified as the conclusions of valid deductive syllogisms.&quot;

==Definition==
Formalism remains one of the most influential and important theories of adjudication and has been called the thesis to which realism is the antithesis. Formalism sees adjudication as the uncontroversial application of accepted principles to known facts to derive the outcome in the manner of a deductive syllogism.

Formalists believe that the relevant principles of law of a given area can be discerned by surveying the case law of that area. Christopher Columbus Langdell believed that the only resources needed to create a science of law was a law library.

Formalism has been called an &quot;autonomous discipline,&quot; in reference to the formalist belief that judges require only the facts and the law, all normative issues such as morality or politics being irrelevant. If judges are seen to be simply applying the rules in a mechanical and uncontroversial manner, this protects judges from criticism. For this reason, formalism has been called &quot;the official theory of judging.&quot;

Formalists, contrary to Realists, take the judge at face value, assuming that the facts and principles as recorded in a judge&#x27;s reasons reflect the facts that the judge considered to be relevant, and the principles that the judge arrived at to reach the judgement. They therefore place little emphasis on the means by which a judge determines the facts.

As a normative theory, legal formalists argue that judges and other public officials should be constrained in their interpretation of legal texts, suggesting that investing the judiciary with the power to say what the law &quot;should&quot; be, rather than confining them to expositing what the law &quot;does&quot; say, violates the separation of powers. This argument is expressed clearly in Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, which provides that the judiciary &quot;shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them; to the end [that Massachusetts&#x27; government] may be a government of laws, and not of men.&quot; Formalism seeks to maintain that separation as a &quot;theory that law is a set of rules and principles independent of other political and social institutions.&quot;

Though formalist thought and influence in the United States has been greatly reduced since the early 20th century, some of its influence remains—especially in the theories of textualism and originalism.

==Comparison to legal instrumentalism==

Legal formalism can be contrasted with legal instrumentalism, a view associated with American legal realism. Instrumentalism is the view that creativity in the interpretation of legal texts is justified to ensure that the law serves good public policy and social interests, including the promotion of justice and the protection of human rights. Legal formalists counter that for judges to change the law to serve their own ideas regarding policy undermines the rule of law.

==Prominent Figures==

===Justice Antonin Scalia and formalism===
The late United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was noted for his formalist views about a variety of topics, particularly his view that the United States Constitution should be interpreted in accord with its original meaning and his view that statutes should be read in accord with their plain meaning.

In &quot;A Matter of Interpretation&quot;, Scalia defended textualism – and, by extension, formalism – saying:
:Of all the criticisms leveled against textualism, the most mindless is that it is &quot;formalistic.&quot; The answer to that is, &quot;of course it&#x27;s formalistic&quot;! The rule of law is &quot;about&quot; form... A murderer has been caught with blood on his hands, bending over the body of his victim; a neighbor with a video camera has filmed the crime; and the murderer has confessed in writing and on videotape. We nonetheless insist that before the state can punish this miscreant, it must conduct a full-dress criminal trial that results in a verdict of guilty. Is that not formalism? Long live formalism. It is what makes a government a government of laws and not of men.

Scalia&#x27;s strongest claim on formalist credentials can be found in his essay, &quot;The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules&quot;.

===Frederick Schauer===

In 1998, Frederick Schauer, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, published a law review article titled &quot;Formalism&quot; in &quot;The Yale Law Journal&quot;. In it he urges scholars to rethink the &quot;contemporary aversion to formalism&quot; and states that his goal is to &quot;rescue formalism from conceptual banishment&quot;. 

He argues that formalism should be conceptually rethought, not in terms merely of whether it is a good or bad thing, but also in terms of how language both can and should be used to restrict the power of decision-makers in the decision-making process.

===Jan Woleński===
In his essay &quot;Formal and informal in legal logic&quot;, Jan Woleński contends that there are &quot;rhetorical functions of metalogical concepts that are used in legal discourse&quot;, and hence the introduction of the informal into otherwise imperative logic. He reviews Jørgensen&#x27;s paradox to introduce deontic logic, and acknowledges this innovation by Georg Henrik von Wright.

<doc id="299928" wikidata="Q334835" url="?curid=299928" title="Sérgio Vieira de Mello">
<text>Sérgio Vieira de Mello (; 15 March 1948 – 19 August 2003) was a Brazilian United Nations diplomat who worked on several UN humanitarian and political programs for over 34 years. The Government of Brazil posthumously awarded the Sergio Vieira de Mello Medal to honor his legacy in promoting sustainable peace, international security and better living conditions for individuals in situations of armed conflict, challenges to which Sérgio Vieira de Mello had dedicated his life and career.

He was killed in the Canal Hotel bombing in Iraq along with 20 other members of his staff on 19 August 2003 while working as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, with the rank of Under-Secretary-General, and United Nations Special Representative for Iraq. Before his death, he was considered a likely candidate for UN Secretary-General.

He has one daughter, Benedicta, posthumously. She later works for the UN also.

==Biography and professional career==
Vieira de Mello was born in Rio de Janeiro to the diplomat Arnaldo Vieira de Mello and his wife Gilda dos Santos on 15 March 1948. He had an older sister, Sônia, who suffered schizophrenia throughout her adult life. The family followed Arnaldo&#x27;s diplomatic postings, such that Sérgio spent his early years in Buenos Aires, Genoa, Milan, Beirut and Rome. In 1965, he was studying philosophy at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, but since classes were frequently disrupted by strikes, he opted to continue his education in Europe. He continued at the University of Paris, where he studied philosophy under Vladimir Jankélévitch. While there, he stayed at an apartment at the Maison de l’Argentine, the student housing at the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris dedicated to students with families from Latin America. He participated in the 1968 student riots in Paris against the Charles de Gaulle government, and was hit in the head by a police baton, causing a permanent disfigurement above his right eye. He also wrote a letter published in the French leftist journal &quot;Combat&quot; in support of the riots, which made his return to Brazil, at this stage a military dictatorship, potentially dangerous. Thus, after graduating from the Sorbonne in 1969, he moved to Geneva to stay with a family friend, and found his first job as an editor at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

From UNHCR, Vieira de Mello moved to the field in Bangladesh during its War of Independence in 1971, and Sudan in 1972 following the Addis Ababa agreement that ended the First Sudanese Civil War and allowed the return of some 650,000 Sudanese refugees and displaced persons, and Cyprus after the Turkish invasion in 1974.

These early assignments were operational, rather than political; he was helping to organize food aid, shelter and other types of aid to refugees. Vieira de Mello remained in the field, with a posting in Mozambique to assist refugees fleeing white rule and civil war in Zimbabwe (at the time, still Rhodesia) where he was deputy head of the office. Due to the absence of his boss, he was effectively running the mission.

Early in his career, he also completed an MA in moral philosophy and a PhD by correspondence from the Sorbonne. His doctorate thesis, submitted in 1974, was entitled &quot;The Role of Philosophy in Contemporary Society&quot;. In 1985, he submitted a second &quot;state&quot; doctorate, the highest degree in the French education system, entitled &quot;Civitas Maxima: Origins, Foundations and Philosophical and Political Significance of the Supranationality Concept&quot;. In addition to his native Portuguese, Vieira de Mello was fluent in English, Spanish, Italian, and French, as well as some conversational Arabic and Tetum.

Vieira de Mello spent three years in charge of UNHCR operations in Mozambique during the civil war that followed its independence from Portugal in 1975, and three more years in Peru. Vieira de Mello also served as Special Envoy for the UNHCR for Cambodia, being the first and only UN Representative to hold talks with the Khmer Rouge. He became a senior political adviser to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon between 1981 and 1983. In 1985, he returned to Latin America to serve as head of the Argentina office in Buenos Aires.

He spent the 1990s involved in the clearing of land mines in Cambodia, and then in Yugoslavia. After working on the refugee problem in central Africa, he was made Assistant High Commissioner for Refugees in 1996 and became Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator two years later. He would hold this position simultaneously with others until January 2001. He was a special UN envoy in Kosovo after the UN took control over the Serbian province in 1999.

Vieira de Mello was instrumental in dealing with the issue of boat people in Hong Kong. In mid-2000, he visited Fiji together with Don McKinnon, the Commonwealth of Nations&#x27; Secretary-General, in an attempt to assist in finding a negotiated settlement to the hostage situation, in which Fiji&#x27;s Prime Minister and other members of Parliament were kidnapped and held as hostages during the 2000 Fijian coup d&#x27;état.

Before becoming the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2002, he was the UN Transitional Administrator in East Timor from December 1999 to May 2002, guiding the former Indonesia&#x27;s 27th province to independence. He was also special representative in Kosovo for an initial period of two months and was the coordinator of humanitarian operations at UN Headquarters.

In May 2003 Vieira de Mello was appointed as the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General to Iraq, an appointment initially intended to last for four months. According to &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; journalist James Traub in his book &quot;The Best Intentions&quot;, Vieira de Mello turned down the appointment three times before Kofi Annan was pressured by US President George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice. According to Samantha Power in her book &quot;Sérgio: One Man&#x27;s Fight to Save the World&quot;, Vieira de Mello met Bush at a meeting in March 2003, at which the two men discussed the human rights situation in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, a controversial issue for the United States. In June 2003, Vieira de Mello was part of a team responsible for inspecting Abu Ghraib prison before it was rebuilt.

==Death==
Vieira de Mello was working as a United Nations Special Representative for Iraq when he was killed in the Canal Hotel bombing. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a leader of the al-Qaeda terrorist organization, claimed responsibility for the blast. A communiqué from al-Qaeda said that de Mello was assassinated because he had helped East Timor become an independent state, thereby stealing territory from the Islamic caliphate.

He had been mentioned in some circles as a suitable candidate for UN Secretary-General. His death was widely mourned, largely on account of his reputation for effectively working to promote peace. Vieira de Mello had previously stated that he wished to be buried in Rio de Janeiro, his hometown, and the place he lived for 34 years. However, his body was taken away from Brazil and he was buried at the Cimetière des Rois in Geneva, Switzerland. Vieira was honoured in his hometown of Rio de Janeiro where he was given a state funeral with full military honors. His funeral was attended by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and other international dignitaries. He was survived by his two sons, Adrien and Laurent.

==Personal life==
In 1973, he met and married Annie Personnaz, a French staff member at UNHCR Headquarters in Geneva, with whom he had two sons, Laurent and Adrien. They lived in the French town of Thonon-les-Bains, before moving a few years later to a permanent home in the French village of Massongy, near the Geneva border.

Despite still being married, the couple was separated before Sérgio&#x27;s death, with a divorce lawsuit filed on 9 January 2003, which was never executed. 

From 2001 onwards, he was in a relationship with , whom he had met in East Timor where she worked as part of the General Service support staff of the UN mission.

Sérgio and Carolina had a union that lasted until his death. The civil union, valid in Brazil despite bigamy being illegal, was the result of a lawsuit won by Larriera against his wife, heirs and the estate, after a process of more than ten years.

The UN failed to recognize officially the union between Sérgio and Carolina. Carolina claims that she was excluded from the list of survivors of the Canal Hotel bombing, and her comments were not taken into account in the report regarding the attack. After his death, she was not invited to any of the United Nations celebrations of his life, while the ex-wife Annie was recognized by the UN as Sérgio&#x27;s widow.

Annie still lives in France, and has co-founded a Swiss charity, the Sérgio Vieira de Mello Foundation, with his two sons and close friends and colleagues to honor his name and memory.

==Awards and recognition==
Vieira de Mello received several posthumous awards and honours, chief of which was the Legion d&#x27;honneur, France&#x27;s highest honor, given to his widow and two sons in Geneva. He was also awarded the Order of Rio Branco, the highest honor from the Government of Brazil to be given to a citizen, the Pedro Ernesto Medal, the highest honor in his hometown of Rio de Janeiro, in 2003. In April 2004, Sérgio Vieira de Mello was posthumously awarded the &quot;Statesman of the Year Award&quot; by the EastWest Institute. In 2003 he received the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights and, in 2004, he received the Pax Christi International Peace Award.

Following the initiative of the Villa Decius Association, the &quot;Polish Prize of Sérgio Vieira de Mello&quot; was established in the year 2003 to promote human rights, democracy, and tolerance and had its first edition in 2004.
Sérgio Vieira de Mello Center

The Sérgio Vieira de Mello Center was founded by his mother, Gilda Vieira de Mello, and Sérgio&#x27;s surviving spouse Carolina Larriera, also a former UN diplomat and Harvard-trained professional, to honor his legacy, and works with a network of supporters out of Brazil, Sergio&#x27;s country of nationality and Timor-Leste, the country he helped create – around the world.

The Sérgio Vieira de Mello Center works through a nationwide network of universities specialized in international relations and the future generation of world ambassadors. Specifically, the Sérgio Vieira de Mello Center focuses on the use of technology, entrepreneurism, and networks to mobilize mentors and disciples and build a sustainable peace model that can be easily replicated. It engages Harvard and MIT engineers and education professionals to empower local communities and schools. The Center matches ivory tower professionals with a base of the pyramid and disenfranchised youth, identifying easily obtained opportunities. With ANAPRI, the National Association of International Relations Professionals is mobilizing Congress for more resources for the professionalization of the sector.

The Center engages and actively supports a network of more than one hundred schools and institutions bearing Sérgio&#x27;s name in Brazil and abroad, and provides teaching tools and in-kind material. It also runs the Gilda Vieira de Mello Prize dedicated to her son Sergio Vieira de Mello which is awarded annually in Geneva during the International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights. The prize comes with a monetary award of CHF 5,000.

Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation

The Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation was created in 2007 to honor his memory, pursue his ideals, and continue his unfinished mission. The Foundation was established in Geneva, at the initiative of his two sons and his estranged wife, with some friends and colleagues. In 2008, Kofi Annan launched the first annual lecture, followed by Sadako Ogata in 2009, by Bernard Kouchner in 2010, by José Manuel Durão Barroso in 2011, and by Cornelio Sommaruga in 2012. Lectures take place at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.

On 11 December 2008, the United Nations General Assembly made history when it adopted Swedish-sponsored GA Resolution A/63/L.49 on the Strengthening of the Coordination of Emergency Assistance of the United Nations, that amongst other important humanitarian decisions, decided to designate 19 August as the World Humanitarian Day (WHD). The Resolution gives for the first time, a special recognition to all humanitarian and United Nations and associated personnel who have worked in the promotion of the humanitarian cause and those who have died in the cause of duty and urges all Member States, entities of the United Nations within existing resources, as well as the other International Organizations and Non-Governmental Organizations to observe it annually in an appropriate way. As a background to this landmark resolution, the family of Sérgio Vieira de Mello resolved to work towards having 19 August recognized as a befitting tribute to all humanitarian personnel. Early April 2008 the Board of the Sérgio Vieira de Mello Foundation prepared a draft Resolution to be sponsored and adopted by the General Assembly designating 19 August as World Humanitarian Day. France, Switzerland, Japan, and Brazil, contacted with the draft Resolution, agreed to co-sponsor it.

Sérgio Vieira de Mello founded the United Nations Housing Rights Programme, currently a part of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, which aims to &quot;assist States and other stakeholders with the implementation of their commitments in the Habitat Agenda&quot;. 

After his death, the Italian city of Bologna was dedicated to Sergio Vieira de Mello a square (&quot;Piazza Sérgio Vieira de Mello&quot;) situated in a modern part of the central quartiere Navile.

Vieira de Mello&#x27;s life was the subject of the 2020 biopic &quot;Sergio&quot;, starring Wagner Moura in the title role.

<text>The Delaware Water Gap is a water gap on the border of the U.S. states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania where the Delaware River cuts through a large ridge of the Appalachian Mountains.

The gap makes up the southern portion of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, which is used primarily for recreational purposes, such as canoeing, fishing, hiking, and rock climbing. Though the US National Park Service manages the National Recreation Area, portions of the water gap are also patrolled by New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry.

The park does not charge an entrance fee but does have expanded amenity fees, including vehicle season and daily passes, bicycles amenity fees, and charges for beach use. Most of the park is open 24-hours a day, with most day-use areas within the park open sunrise to sunset (such as trailhead parking lots, Millbrook Village, and all picnic areas).

==Geology==

A water gap is a geological feature where a river cuts through a mountain ridge. The Delaware Water Gap formed 500 million years ago when quartz pebbles from mountains in the area were deposited in a shallow sea. The Martinsburg Shale on the eastern side of what was to be Kittatinny Mountain was uplifted 450 million years ago when a chain of volcanic islands collided with proto-North America. These islands slid over the North American plate, and deposited rock on top of the plate, forming the Highlands and Kittatinny Valley.

About 400 million years ago, a small continent collided with proto-North America. The heat from the pressure melted the quartzite, which allowed it to bend the quartz pebbles. This layer was then uplifted and cracked over thousands of years. During this period, the Delaware River slowly cut its path down through the shattered and cracked quartzite. If the quartzite had not been cracked, the river would not have been able to cut its path through the mountain to form the gap.

Millions of years of rain, ice, snow, and wind erosion shaped the area. The Wisconsin glaciation, which occurred between 21,000 BCE and 13,000 BCE, covered the entire Kittatinny Ridge and ended near Belvidere. When the glaciers retreated, the existing gap assumed its present form.

The mountain is composed of Silurian shawangunk conglomerate. This is gray quartzite, which makes the mountain highly resistant to weathering. The Silurian High Fall formation of sandstone is on the western side of the gap near the base. The eastern side of the gap has Ordovician Martinsburg shale. Sedimentary rock is along the river. The Bloomsburg Red Beds, a red shale, are at the gap under Dunnfield Creek.

The Delaware Water Gap is nearly wide at river level and about wide from the top of Mt. Tammany to the top of Mt. Minsi. It is more than from mountaintop to the river surface. The river through the gap is above sea level.

The ridge of the Appalachians that the Delaware River crosses is called the Blue Mountains in Pennsylvania and the Kittatinny Ridge in Warren County, New Jersey. This is the first major ridge of the Appalachian mountains. New Jersey&#x27;s mountain is Mount Tammany, named after the Lenni-Lenape Chief Tamanend. The Pennsylvania mountain is Mount Minsi, named after the Native American tribe of the area. The summit of Tammany is above sea level.

==Flora and fauna==

In 1739, America&#x27;s first botanist, John Bartram of Philadelphia, followed the course of the Delaware River in his search for American trees, evergreens and shrubs to supply new species that were formerly unknown to British naturalists. These gardeners waited months for shipments of saplings, seeds, and pinecones to be sent by sea that were then introduced into English gardens. Using Native American trails, Bartram rode on horseback through the Water Gap, which allowed entry to the lands beyond.

A northern deciduous forest cloaks the slopes of the Delaware Water Gap. Hardwood species comprising the forest include various oaks, hickories, maples, ash, elm, cherry, walnut, birch, sycamore, and beech. Coniferous species include Eastern White Pine, Pitch Pine, Eastern Red Cedar, and Eastern Hemlock.

Black bear, white-tailed deer, gray squirrels, red squirrels, raccoons, gray fox, fisher, and chipmunks are some of the forest species of the area. Hunting of deer, turkey, and small game is permitted, following NJ Fish &amp; Wildlife regulations, but is not permitted at any of the campsites.

Shad migrate up the river through the gap in the spring. Other fish include bass, trout, carp, and walleye. Dunnfield Creek has been designated a &quot;Wild Trout Stream&quot; because of its natural brook trout fishery.

Timber rattlesnakes and copperheads also inhabit the rocky areas of the mountain. Salamanders are found in the moist areas of the forest. Eastern prickly pear cactus also grows on the mountain near the red dot trail on the south eastern facing slope halfway up the mountain.

==Transportation==

Steep rock walls prohibited foot travel through the gap until a road was built on the Pennsylvania side of the river in 1793. In 1830, a road was built on the New Jersey side through the gap and north toward Pahaquarry. Interstate 80 passes through the gap on the New Jersey side as of the early 1970s via the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge, and occupies the former right-of-way of the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway.

The Pennsylvania portion of the New Jersey Cut-Off mainline of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad comes into Slateford, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Railroad Authority owns the trackage in the Water Gap area. Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad operates the lines that run through the gap. Pennsylvania Route 611 occupies the right-of-way of a former trolley line.

Martz Trailways has a bus station within the municipal boundaries of Delaware Water Gap. There are also numerous jitneys that stop there on their route between New York City and towns further areas such as Hazleton, Wilkes-Barre, and Scranton.

==Tocks Island and the National Park Service==
In 1962, the Congress authorized the building of a dam across the Delaware River at Tocks Island, upstream of the water gap. Meant to control hurricane-related flooding, it was never built. The land for the proposed reservoir, which had already been purchased, was used to create the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in 1965.

There are two visitor centers, one in New Jersey near the Delaware River bridge and the other in Dingman&#x27;s Ferry, Pennsylvania. Headquarters is located on River Road in Pennsylvania. The New Jersey side of the gap is also protected within Worthington State Forest, a forest wholly contained within the recreation area.

==Hiking trails==
===Mount Tammany Trail===
One of two trails leading up 1,200 vertical feet to the summit of Mt. Tammany. Once completed, one can see views of Mt. Minsi in Pennsylvania on the other side of the gap.

===Pahaquarry Trail===
The second trail to the top of Mt. Tammany. The most challenging hike in the park is to combine the Red Dot and Blue Blaze trails into a loop. Park Services suggest ascending the Red Dot and descending the Blue Blaze, and the Blue trail is less steep.

===Dunnfield Creek Trail===
Dunnfield Creek Trail departs from the Appalachian Trail above the Delaware River, follows the creek for two-thirds of its length with numerous stream crossings. The trail then climbs a ravine to rejoin the Appalachian Trail at Sunfish Pond.

===Appalachian Trail===

Running from Springer Mountain, Georgia to Mt. Katahdin in Baxter State Park, Maine, the Appalachian Trail enters the Delaware Water Gap at the Delaware River on the Route 80 Bridge. It goes to Sunfish Pond, and continues northeast to Stokes State Forest. The trail crosses Route 206 and continues along the ridgeline of the Kittatinny Mountains to High Point State Park, eventually entering New York. Of the of trail, are within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.

Additional trails also traverse through the area.

==Rock climbing==
The gap is a popular place to rock-climb in New Jersey. The climbs are . Most climbing is done on the New Jersey side due to easier access. There are about one hundred climbs on the New Jersey side. Climbs range from 5.1 to 5.14 on the Yosemite Decimal System scale. Climbers follow the gray dot trail along Route 80, then pass the large rock face, then go up the path to the route they choose.

Beginning in 2010, the Pennsylvania side has been periodically closed to climbing during the nesting season for the endangered peregrine falcons.

==Boy Scout camps==
The Easton Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America operated Weygadt Scout Reservation at the base of Mount Tammany from 1931 until 1968. The Reservation was originally home to two Scout camps—the Easton Council&#x27;s Camp Weygadt on the southern part of the reservation and the Minsi Trails Council&#x27;s Camp Minsi on the northern section of the reservation. In the later part of the 1930s, the Bethlehem Council moved their camp to the Poconos, and the entire reservation in the Water Gap became Camp Weygadt. Camp Minsi is now located in Pocono Summit, Pennsylvania, on the shores of Stillwater Lake.

Pahaquarra Boy Scout Camp was located on the New Jersey side of the Delaware Water Gap on Old Mine Road at the abandoned Pahaquarry Copper Mine. The camp served Boy Scouts from the George Washington Council. Just north of this camp was Camp Cowaw Boy Scout Camp which served Raritan Council Boy Scouts.

<text>Oklo is a region near Franceville in the Haut-Ogooué Province of Gabon. Several natural nuclear fission reactors were discovered in the uranium mines in the region in 1972.

==History==
Gabon was a French colony when prospectors from the Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique (the industrial parts, which later became Orano Cycle) discovered uranium in the remote region in 1956. France immediately opened mines operated by Comuf () near Mounana village to exploit the vast mineral resources, and the state of Gabon was given a minority share in the company.

For 40 years, France mined uranium in Gabon. Once extracted, the uranium was used for electricity production in France and much of Europe. Today the uranium deposits are exhausted, and the mine is no longer active. Currently, mine reclamation work is ongoing in the region affected by the mine operations.

== Natural nuclear fission reactor ==
Some of the mined uranium was found to have a lower concentration of uranium-235 than expected, as if it had already been in a nuclear reactor. When geologists investigated they also found products typical of a reactor. They concluded that the deposit had been in a reactor: a natural nuclear fission reactor, around 1.8 to 1.7 billion years BP – in the Paleoproterozoic Era during Precambrian times, during the Statherian period – and continued for a few hundred thousand years, probably averaging less than 100 kW of thermal power during that time. At that time the natural uranium had a concentration of about 3% 235U and could have reached criticality with natural water as neutron moderator allowed by the special geometry of the deposit.

<text>The Cyperaceae () are a family of graminoid (grass-like), monocotyledonous flowering plants known as . The family is large; botanists have described some 5,500 known species in about 90 generathe largest being the &quot;true &quot; (genus &quot;Carex&quot;), with over 2,000 species.

== Distribution ==

Cyperaceae species are widely distributed with the centers of diversity for the group occurring in tropical Asia and tropical South America. While sedges grow in almost all environments, many thrive in wetlands or in poor soils. Ecological communities dominated by sedges are known as s or as sedge meadows.

== Classification ==
Some species superficially resemble the closely related rushes and the more distantly related grasses. Features distinguishing members of the sedge family from grasses or rushes are stems with triangular cross-sections (with occasional exceptions, a notable example being the tule that has a round cross-section) and leaves that are spirally arranged in three ranks. In comparison, grasses have alternate leaves, forming two ranks. This difference leads to the mnemonic &quot;sedges have edges&quot; in order to tell them apart from generally round rushes or hollow, nodded grasses.

Some well-known sedges include the water chestnut (&quot;Eleocharis dulcis&quot;) and the papyrus sedge (&quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot;), from which the writing material papyrus was made. This family also includes cotton-grass (&quot;Eriophorum&quot;), spike-rush (&quot;Eleocharis&quot;), sawgrass (&quot;Cladium&quot;), nutsedge or nutgrass (also called chufa, &quot;Cyperus esculentus&quot;/&quot;Cyperus rotundus&quot;, a cultivated crop and common weed), white star sedge (&quot;Rhynchospora colorata&quot;), and umbrella sedge (&quot;Cyperus alternifolius&quot;), also known as umbrella papyrus

== Features ==
Members of this family are characterised by the formation of dauciform (carrot-like) roots that are an alteration in root morphology that researchers regard as analogous to cluster roots in Proteaceae, which help uptake of nutrients such as phosphorus from poor soil. Like other members of the order Poales, sedges are mostly wind-pollinated, but there are exceptions. &quot;Cyperus niveus&quot; and &quot;Cyperus sphaerocephalus,&quot; both with accordingly more conspicuous flowers, are insect-pollinated.

== Evolution ==

Researchers have identified sedges occurring at least as early as the Eocene epoch.

==Genera==
, 93 genera are accepted by Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online.

<doc id="299941" wikidata="Q310752" url="?curid=299941" title="Geezer Butler">
<text>Terence Michael Joseph &quot;Geezer&quot; Butler (born 17 July 1949) is an English musician, best known as the bassist and primary lyricist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath. He has also recorded and performed with Heaven &amp; Hell, GZR, Ozzy Osbourne, and Deadland Ritual.

==Early life==
Butler adopted the nickname &quot;Geezer&quot; at an early age. &quot;It came because when I was at school, my brother was in the army, and he was based with a lot of Cockneys. And people in London call everybody a &#x27;geezer.&#x27; [It means] just a man — like, &#x27;Hello, mate.&#x27; It&#x27;s just like somebody calling you &#x27;dude&#x27; over here (in the United States). In England, it&#x27;d be &#x27;geezer.&#x27; So my brother used to come home from leave from the army, and he&#x27;d be going, &#x27;Hello, geezer. How are you, geezer?&#x27; So because I had looked up to my brother when I was about seven years old, I&#x27;d go to school calling everybody a geezer. So that&#x27;s how I got cursed with it.&quot;

Butler grew up in a working-class Irish Catholic family, the son of James and Mary Butler. He had six siblings. His father had served in the Royal Scots Regiment and later settled in Birmingham, where he worked for an engineering company. Mary had worked as a nanny in her younger years and became a housewife after marrying James in 1929. Both of his parents were born in Dublin. The family had seven children and were poor, typically having &quot;no money whatsoever&quot;. He was born in the family house on Victoria Road in the Aston section of Birmingham, a house that had been damaged by Luftwaffe bombs during the Second World War. When he was just one day old, his older sister Eileen tried to toss him out a bedroom window in a fit of jealousy. 

Butler has said that he enjoyed an &quot;incredibly loving, happy childhood&quot;. The family home had no telephone, hot water or bathroom, and considered itself lucky to have their own outside toilet. Two of Butler&#x27;s older brothers had been called upon to serve in the army and Butler feared that he would be next. However, mandatory national service was ended in the United Kingdom a couple of years before he was due to be conscripted. 

At the age of ten, Butler passed a test and was invited to attend Birmingham&#x27;s prestigious Holte Grammar School in 1960. Learning English literature such as Shakespeare and Homer furthered his love of reading, and he says &quot;I never went a day without reading &quot;something&quot;.&quot; He credits this education, along with his vivid imagination, for the composition skills he would later utilise as Black Sabbath&#x27;s lyricist. He was later heavily influenced by the writing of Aleister Crowley as a teenager. 

By his late teens, he had stopped attending Mass. He cited a loss of belief, and feels that everyone should sooner or later decide for themselves what to believe in. By the end, Butler was &quot;going to Mass every Sunday just to take a look at all the nice girls that were going there&quot;, he recalled years later. After growing his hair long as a teenager, he would encounter a nun every Sunday at Mass who found it humorous to refer to Butler as &quot;miss&quot;, and he soon decided to never go back.

Butler became obsessed with The Beatles and The Kinks, and later Cream and Jimi Hendrix. When The Beatles appeared on a Birmingham television program called &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; in January 1963, Butler waited outside the studio to get a glimpse of them. It was here that he met another Beatles&#x27; fan, John &quot;Ozzy&quot; Osbourne, for the first time.

== Career ==

Butler joined his first band, the Ruums, named after an Arthur Porges science fiction story, in 1965. His first professional gig was with the Ruums at the Parochial Hall in Erdington, where they performed covers of various Merseybeat bands. The Ruums would perform only a handful of local gigs before breaking up, but it was long enough for Butler to decide that he wanted to devote his life to music. 

In late 1967, Butler formed the band The Rare Breed, with an acquaintance named Ozzy Osbourne soon joining as lead vocalist. At that time, Butler was dating a girl named Georgina who lived near Tony Iommi, and Iommi&#x27;s earliest memories of Butler involved seeing him walking past his house every day to visit her. Georgina would later become Butler&#x27;s first wife. Later, Iommi and Butler became acquainted when their bands played at a nearby nightclub. Separated for a time after The Rare Breed disbanded, Butler and Osbourne reunited to form the blues foursome Polka Tulk, along with guitarist Iommi and drummer Bill Ward, both of whom had recently left a local blues band called Mythology. Polka Tulk was soon rebranded as Earth, but a band already existed in the small-time English circuit with the same name, so they were forced to change the name again to avoid confusion. Inspired by the popular Boris Karloff horror film of the same name, Butler suggested the name Black Sabbath in early 1969.

Inspired by John Lennon, Butler played rhythm guitar in his pre-Sabbath days, including with The Rare Breed. When Sabbath was formed, Iommi made it clear that he did not want to play with another guitarist, so Butler moved to bass. According to Butler, &quot;I&#x27;d never played bass until I was on stage at the first gig that we played. Borrowed the bass guitar off one of my friends and it only had three strings on it.&quot; Butler lists Jack Bruce of Cream as his biggest influence as a bassist. Iommi described Butler as being &quot;from another planet&quot; in the band&#x27;s early days; he took LSD, wore Indian hippie dresses, and was very peaceful. At the time Black Sabbath was formed, Butler had been hired by a Birmingham steel company to train in the accounting department, and this business experience resulted in him managing the band&#x27;s finances in the early days.

In the summer of 1977, drummer Bill Ward visited Butler at his Worcestershire home to inform him he had been fired from Black Sabbath after a band meeting, telling him that Iommi and Osbourne questioned his commitment. Butler said he was &quot;pissed off&quot; yet relieved, and spent the following two or three weeks resting and getting healthy, not giving much thought to what he would do next. He then received a phone call from Ward inviting him to rehearsals which were starting the next day. Upon returning to the band, Butler says Iommi and Osbourne both denied any involvement in his firing, with Ward claiming he had merely been the messenger. He says he was never offered an explanation. The event changed Butler&#x27;s attitude towards Black Sabbath and he was never able to completely trust his bandmates again, saying &quot;a little bit of me died back then&quot;. He has said that he did not really want to return but did so only because he had nothing else going on musically. 

After Black Sabbath fired Osbourne in 1979, Butler also briefly left the band to deal with the divorce from his first wife. The 1980 album &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; was recorded with bassist Craig Gruber but Butler returned to the band at the last minute and re-recorded the bass parts prior to release. He again left the band in 1984 after touring in support of their 1983 album, &quot;Born Again&quot;, although he returned months later as the band attempted a comeback with vocalist David Donato.

In 1988, Butler joined the backing band of his former Sabbath bandmate Osbourne to take part in the &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; World Tour. He rejoined Black Sabbath in 1991 for the reunion of the &quot;Mob Rules&quot; line-up, but again quit the group after the &quot;Cross Purposes&quot; tour in 1994.

In 1995 Butler again joined Osbourne&#x27;s band to perform on the &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; album. After recording &quot;Ozzmosis&quot;, he formed G/Z/R, issuing &quot;Plastic Planet&quot; in 1995. His next solo album, &quot;Black Science,&quot; followed in 1997. Butler returned to Sabbath once more for the 1997 edition of Ozzfest, and has remained with the band since. In 2005 he released &quot;Ohmwork&quot;, his third solo album. In October 2006 it was announced that Butler, along with Tony Iommi, would be reforming the &quot;Dehumanizer&quot;-era Black Sabbath line-up with Vinny Appice and Ronnie James Dio, under the name Heaven &amp; Hell to differentiate between the reunited touring band fronted by Osbourne, and the Dio-fronted version of the band.

He rejoined Iommi and Osbourne to record &quot;13&quot; and toured in support of the album from 2012 to 2014. He and Black Sabbath later embarked on their final tour which began in January 2016, and concluded in February 2017.

In 2023, Butler published his autobiography &quot;Into the Void: From Birth to Black Sabbath—And Beyond&quot;. He also provided the narrating voice for the audio-book version. Later, he made a brief appearance during Foo Fighter&#x27;s performance in Birmingham in June 2024.

== Style and legacy==

Butler learned guitar as a teenager on an old acoustic that had only two strings. He could not afford the new strings needed to play chords, so he taught himself to play melody lines on the two strings. He says that due to this limitation he developed a &quot;very strange style&quot; which would later serve him well when he switched to bass guitar after forming Black Sabbath. Later, his older brother Jimmy gifted him a brand new Rosetti acoustic guitar that cost him two weeks salary, an act of kindness that Butler says changed his life forever. With a proper instrument, Butler learned chords from the Bert Weedon book &quot;Play in a Day&quot; and saved enough money for a new Höfner Colorama electric guitar and Bird Golden Eagle amplifier. Soon after, he joined his first band.

Butler is noted for his melodic playing, and as being one of the first bassists to use a wah pedal and to down-tune his instrument (from the standard E-A-D-G to the lower C#-F#-B-E), as exemplified on Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Master of Reality&quot; album, to match Iommi who had started tuning his guitar to C# (a minor third down). During the band&#x27;s Ozzy Osbourne era, Butler wrote most of the band&#x27;s lyrics, drawing heavily upon his fascination with religion, science-fiction, fantasy and horror, and musings on the darker side of human nature that posed a constant threat of global annihilation.

Butler is regarded as one of the most influential bassists in heavy metal. Billy Sheehan of Mr. Big said: &quot;He&#x27;s a founding father of a whole genre of music and a man who really set the bar early on to be such an integral part of the sound and song structure of Sabbath&quot;. In Mick Wall&#x27;s biography of Iron Maiden entitled &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;, founder Steve Harris recalls: &quot;I distinctly remember trying to play along to Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid&quot; – at first I just could not get it. I threw the guitar on my bed and walked out in a huff, but the next day I came back, picked it up and played it all the way through note-for-note! Once I got going, I started getting into bass-lines with a bit more subtlety to them.&quot;

Former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted, who defined him his &quot;number 1 influence,&quot; stated: &quot;All true metal bassists look up to Geezer as a pioneer and Godfather of our chosen instrument. The best, ever.&quot; Rex Brown of Pantera and Kill Devil Hill asserted: &quot;He&#x27;s a legend. He&#x27;s everything. Geezer is so much of an influence on me. Other bassists such as Peter Steele, and Cliff Burton have also listed Butler as an influence.

In 2020, he was ranked 21st in Rolling Stone&#x27;s list &quot;50 Greatest Bassists of All Time&quot;.

==Personal life==

Butler met his first wife Georgina at a school dance at Holte Grammar School in Birmingham as a teenager. The couple divorced in 1980. Butler had already met his second wife, Gloria, on 16 September 1978 just prior to Black Sabbath&#x27;s concert at the Checkerdome in St. Louis, Missouri. Gloria later served as manager for Heaven &amp; Hell. The Butlers also share their Los Angeles home with several cats, of whom he has posted pictures on his website. 

His oldest son, Biff Butler, was the vocalist for nu metal band Apartment 26. Butler has stated that Biff is very religious and brings up his children in the Catholic faith. Butler&#x27;s other son James earned a degree in social sciences from Oxford University and resides in London. Butler describes him as &quot;very politically minded&quot;. &quot;My youngest is extremely left-wing, and I think it&#x27;s because he was brought up knowing wealth and money, whereas I was brought up having no money whatsoever. That&#x27;s where the church came in and made up for the lack of money because everybody knew each other in the street and everybody used to help each other out&quot;, Butler said.

Due to his love of animals, Butler became a strict vegetarian as a child and later became a vegan in the 1990s. He had a pet dog named Scamp in the 1950s who he &quot;got to love more than any human friend&quot; and the family house was &quot;full of pets&quot;. Upon discovering where meat came from, he resolved to never eat it again. His mother was also a vegetarian. Butler appeared in a promotional ad for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in 2009 and later urged fans to boycott Fortnum &amp; Mason until they remove foie gras from their shelves. Butler said, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen some outrageous things in my time, but watching those poor birds suffer simply so that their diseased livers can be sold on your shop floor is horrific!&quot; 

Butler is a lifelong supporter of Aston Villa Football Club, and during Black Sabbath&#x27;s induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Butler is heard shouting &quot;Up the Villa&quot; as the members of the band left the stage. He has referred to AVFC as his &quot;second religion&quot; (after Catholicism) in his younger days and in 2023 he said that the team had become his &quot;only religion&quot;, having become disillusioned with the Catholic church. From the family house on Victoria Road in Aston, Butler could hear the roar of the crowd at nearby Villa Park, and he has said that hearing such cheering every week had a profound effect on him as a small child. He started attending games anytime he could and lists former Aston Villa star Peter McParland as his &quot;all-time hero&quot;.

According to Black Sabbath bandmate Ozzy Osbourne, Butler &quot;never uses foul language&quot;. A bin-man (refuse collector) had called him an &quot;Irish cunt&quot; when he was a small child, and he repeated the word at the family dinner table that evening, asking what it meant. His father told him that only ignorant people swear, and Butler was subsequently beaten with a belt. He says that to this day he seldom swears &quot;despite spending thousands of days in the company of Ozzy Osbourne&quot;.

Over the years, Butler has become disillusioned with politics, saying &quot;For me, it&#x27;s almost pointless voting anymore because it seems to be the same no matter what party or politics you stand for. It all seems corrupted to me. It&#x27;s all the same old people that rule the world.&quot; He has also expressed concern over the increasing level of control government has in people&#x27;s lives. &quot;Every time I go back to England, there are things that totally surprise me that you never think would happen in England, just all the CCTV everywhere. There seems to be so much control over people these days&quot;, he said in 2014. He has similarly become completely disillusioned with religion, calling it &quot;inherited brainwashing&quot;. 

In January 2015, Butler was briefly detained after a bar brawl in Death Valley, California and charged with misdemeanour assault, public intoxication and vandalism. He was released following detoxification and a citation. In 2016 he opened up about the event: &quot;This guy started mouthing off about something. He was, like, some drunken Nazi bloke. He [...] started going on about Jews and everything – Jews this, Jews that. My missus is Jewish and I&#x27;d just had enough, and me hand sort of met his chin. I whacked him one.&quot;

In June 2023, he announced his retirement from performing. He initially ruled out a Black Sabbath reunion, saying the band was &quot;put to bed&quot;, though a one-off show was later announced in February 2025 to take place in July of that year.

==Equipment==
Butler endorses Lakland basses and has his own signature model, as well as DR Strings, EMG pick-ups, and Hartke amplifiers.

<text>The 2003 West Virginia sniper attacks were a series of sniper-style shootings that took place over the course of several days in August 2003 in the U.S. state of West Virginia, killing three people. The victims were killed by a single bullet from long distances as they stopped at shops or gas stations.

In July 2012, Shawn Lester, who had been indicted for all three murders in 2011, pleaded guilty to the second degree murder of one of the victims. The charges with respect to the other two murders were dropped as part of a plea bargain. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison.

The shootings were reminiscent of the D.C. sniper attacks that took place in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. in October 2002.

==Shootings==
On August 10, 2003, Gary Carrier Jr., 44, of South Charleston, was fatally shot in the head while talking on a payphone outside a Charleston GoMart.

On August 14, 2003, Jeanie Patton, 31, was killed at a Speedway filling station around 10:30. She was fatally struck by a bullet to the back of her head as she was about to pay for gas she pumped.

90 minutes after Patton&#x27;s killing, Okey Meadows Jr., 26, was shot in the neck while purchasing milk at a security window at the GoMart on U.S. Route 60, 10 miles away from Patton. Both Patton and Meadows were residents of Campbells Creek.

==Investigation==
All three victims were killed late at night by the same kind of small-caliber rifle, although police did not determine whether the same weapon was used to kill all three. Ballistic tests showed that a .22 Magnum Marlin rifle was used to kill the second and third victims. The first bullet could not be completely checked due to damage, but appeared to have similar characteristics to the other two bullets. Police said that they were looking for a dark-colored full-size pickup truck. Eyewitnesses believed the driver was a large white male, but could not identify the suspect further due to the darkness. A man was eventually arrested who matched this profile and who had implied to witnesses he was the sniper, but no charges related to the shootings were ever brought against him.

Police considered the possibility that the shootings were drug-related, as Patton and Meadows had drug connections. However, police were not aware of any drug connections for the first victim.

About five months earlier, while exiting a local Kroger supermarket, Randy Burgess was shot twice in the chest sniper-style and died the next day. Although no hard evidence connected this murder with the three that would follow, investigators did not dismiss the possibility. In October 2003, a joint task force investigating the shootings announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to the killer. This reward would later be increased to $100,000.

A key witness identified a local area resident, Shawn Lester, as the shooter shortly after the murder. At some time before the three successive murders, the witness&#x27;s younger brother had stolen an automobile engine belonging to Lester that had a large quantity of methamphetamine hidden inside. Lester later confided in the witness that &quot;he had taken something important to me, so I&#x27;ll take something important to him&quot;, and told him to &quot;keep an eye on the news&quot;. Jeanie Patton was the longtime girlfriend of the witness&#x27;s younger brother.

When the Kanawha County Sheriff&#x27;s Department failed to act on the witness&#x27;s information, despite him passing a polygraph test, the witness agreed to be a guest (anonymously) on a local public-access television program titled &quot;West Virginia&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. The show aired in January 2007. The show&#x27;s host, Andrew Palmer, presented a theory that a gang called the &quot;Charleston Five&quot; had carried out the shootings. He suggested that two victims were chosen randomly to throw suspicion off the gang for killing its intended target, Jeanie Patton.

Seven and a half years later, on March 31, 2011, Shawn Lester was arrested and charged with the murder of Jeanie Patton. The property of a woman believed to have sheltered Lester and his gang was excavated to search for the pickup truck used in at least two of the murders and for bodies of possible further victims.

==Conviction==
Lester was indicted for all three murders in August 2011. At the outset of his trial a year later, he pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Jeanie Patton. However, the murder charges with respect to Gary Carrier Jr. and Okey Meadows Jr. were dropped as part of the plea bargain. Lester was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Later, Lester was sentenced to an additional 6 years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to firearms possession charges.

<text>Tutoring is private academic help, usually provided by an expert teacher; someone with deep knowledge or defined expertise in a particular subject or set of subjects. 
A tutor, formally also called an academic tutor, is a person who provides assistance or tutelage to one or more people on certain subject areas or skills. The tutor spends a few hours on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis to transfer their expertise on the topic or skill to the student (also called a tutee). Tutoring can take place in different settings.

==History==
Formal education is first attested among the scribes of ancient Egypt but, in most fields, instruction was traditionally handled on a personal basis, with most skills and professions long handed down within families or via apprenticeship until the modern era. In classical antiquity, the lower classes could pay for instruction in group settings like ludi but the upper classes preferred personalized home tutoring. In ancient China, some aristocratic tutors like Confucius and Mencius attracted so many students that they established influential philosophies. In ancient Greece, some sophists established lucrative careers teaching the important skills of public speaking for the assembly or courts; in Plato&#x27;s works, Socrates provides similar services for free while criticizing the sophists for their presumed lack of concern for actual truth and understanding. In the case of the ancient Romans, the education of the patricians and wealthy plebeians was frequently provided by Greek slaves. 

Royal tutors, the personal instructors of future rulers, have always enjoyed importance and prestige. In particular, the Grand Tutor (, &quot;tàifù&quot;) was one of the three great lords of the royal court of the Zhou dynasty of ancient China. Similar positions remained in very high importance across East Asia into the modern era.

By some accounting, methods of tutoring only began to become more structured after the 20th century through focus and specialization in the training of tutors, application of tutoring, and evaluation of tutors. From the 20th century onwards, with the rapid spread of mainstream education, the demand for tutoring has also increased as a way to supplement formal education.

==British and Irish secondary schools==

In British and Irish secondary schools, &quot;form tutors&quot; are given the responsibilities of a form or class of students in a particular year group (up to 30 students). They usually work in year teams headed by a year leader, year head, or guidance teacher. Form tutors will provide parents with most of the information about their child&#x27;s progress and any problems they might be experiencing.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, private tutoring, outside school, is common for students who need extra support in one or more subjects, particularly leading up to exams. In Ireland this is known as grinds.

In the British higher education system, a tutor is a general term for someone delivering tutorials, individually or in small groups. See tutorial system.

==Private tutoring in Asia==
A 2012 study by the Asian Development Bank and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong pointed out that private tutoring can dominate the lives of young people and their families, maintain and exacerbate social inequalities, divert needed household income into an unregulated industry, and create inefficiencies in education systems. It can also undermine official statements about fee-free education and create threats to social cohesion.

In South Korea, nearly 90% of elementary students receive some form of shadow education, usually in cram schools termed &quot;Hagwon&quot;. In Hong Kong, about 85% of senior secondary students do so. 60% of primary students in West Bengal, India, and 60% of secondary students in Kazakhstan receive private tutoring.

Demand for tutoring in Asia is exploding; by comparison globally, shadow education is most extensive in Asia. This is partly due to the stratification of education systems, cultural factors, perceptions of shortcomings in regular school systems, and the combination of growing wealth and smaller family sizes. Therefore, the education sector has become a profitable industry which businesses have created different kinds of products and advertisement such as &quot;the king/queen of tutorial&quot;, a usual advertisement tactic of Hong Kong tutorial centers that has spread to South Korea, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India where tutors achieve &quot;celebrity-like status&quot;. In some cases, successful Southeast Asian tutors will even embrace the title of &quot;tutor&quot;. Online private tutor matching platforms and learning platform offering online learning materials are other product offerings.

In Cambodia, most tutoring is provided by teachers, whereas in Hong Kong, it is provided by individuals, small companies or large companies. In Mongolia, most tutoring is labor-intensive, while entrepreneurs in South Korea make use of computers and other forms of technology.

===Policy===
A 2012 study by the Asian Development Bank and the Comparative Education Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong recommended policymakers across the region take a closer look at how ‘shadow education’ affects family budgets, children&#x27;s time, and national education systems. It suggested that in order to reduce the need for private lessons, improvements in mainstream schools should be made. Regulations are also needed to protect citizens.

On 24 July 2021, the Double Reduction Policy got promulgated jointly by the General Office of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The policy reclassified tutoring institutions in China as non-profit organizations, which solved the over-reliance of Chinese students on after-school tutoring classes, and reduced the additional financial burden on Chinese families. Chinese families spend 40 to 50 percent of their total domestic spending on tutoring. The double reduction policy&#x27;s regulation of shadow education has improved the quality of school curriculum during the Compulsory education period and relieved the inequality of educational resources caused by the economic gap.

==Costs of tutoring==
Some studies have estimated costs associated with &quot;shadow education&quot;. In Pakistan, expenditures on tutoring per child averaged $3.40 a month in 2011. In Japan, families spent $12 billion in 2010 on private tutoring. 

In Georgia, household expenditures for private tutoring at the secondary school level was $48 million in 2011. In Hong Kong, the business of providing private tutoring to secondary schools reached $255 million in 2011. The estimated size of the private tuition industry in India was estimated to be worth around $70 billion in 2017. 

In South Korea, where the government has attempted to cool down the private tutoring market, shadow education costs have nonetheless continually grown, reaching $17.3 billion in 2010. Household expenditures on private tutoring are equivalent to about 80% of government expenditures on public education for primary and secondary students.

In the United States, the tutoring market is fragmented. Some online tutoring marketplaces, however, have managed to aggregate a large number of private tutors on their platform and also tutoring data. For example, one such site has over 34,000 registered tutors in California and made public their tutoring hourly rate data.

In the United Kingdom, the cost of tuition is dependent upon a variety of factors such as subject, level (Key Stages, GCSE or A-Level), tutor experience and whether the lesson takes place virtually or in person. If you are looking to receive online tutoring from a qualified UK teacher with a verified certificate it will cost between £30 &amp; 40 per hour. It is also common in the UK to apply for tutoring sessions through your local school if you are struggling to help subsidise the cost through the National Tuition Programme.

==Effectiveness==
Research supports the literature that students who seek and receive tutoring services outperformed their counterparts. However, private tutoring is not always effective in raising academic achievement; and in some schools students commonly skip classes or sleep through lessons because they are tired after excessive external study. This means that the shadow system can make regular schooling less efficient.

In many countries, individuals can become tutors without training. In some countries, including Cambodia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Lao PDR, and Tajikistan, the pattern of classroom teachers supplementing their incomes by tutoring students after school hours is more a necessity than a choice, as many teachers’ salaries hover close to the poverty line.

In South Korea, the number of private tutors expanded roughly 7.1% annually on average from 2001 to 2006, and by 2009 the sector was the largest employer of graduates from the humanities and social sciences.

Teachers who spend more time focusing on private lessons than regular classes can cause greater inefficiencies in the mainstream school system. Situations in which teachers provide extra private lessons for pupils for whom they are already responsible in the public system can lead to corruption, particularly when teachers deliberately teach less in their regular classes in order to promote the market for private lessons.

When private tutoring is provided by well trained tutor however the effects can be dramatic, with pupils improving performance by two standard deviations, a result known as Bloom&#x27;s 2 sigma problem.

==Types of tutoring==
There can be an existing overlap between different types of tutoring with respect to the setting or location of tutoring, the size of tutor-learner pairings/groups, and the method of tutoring provided, for example, one-on-one peer tutoring can take place through online tutoring. Tutoring is typically private since it is exists independent of the system of public and private education, that is, one can be enrolled in public/private schooling and attend private tutoring services.

===Academic coaching===
Academic coaching is a type of mentoring applied to academics. Coaching involves a collaborative approach. Coaches try to help students learn how they best learn and how to operate in an academic environment. Tutors help students learn the material in individual courses while coaches help students learn how to be successful in school. In college, that includes such topics as: study skills, time management, stress management, goal setting, organization, resource utilization, effective reading, note-taking, test-taking, communication, and understanding how to use a syllabus. Academic coaches meet with the student regularly throughout the semester. Coaches work with students in all kinds of situations, not just those who are struggling academically. Academic coaching also serves to help students prepare for entrance exams to gain entry to schools or universities, and it is particularly popular in Asia. For example, in India, a majority of students, be it of any class or stream, visit a coaching center or a &quot;study circle.&quot; 

===Home-based tutoring===
In-home tutoring is a form of tutoring that occurs in the home. Most often the tutoring relates to an academic subject or test preparation. This is in contrast to tutoring centers or tutoring provided through after-school programs. The service most often involves one-on-one attention provided to the pupil. Due to the informal and private nature of in-home tutoring, there is limited substantial or conclusive information on in-home tutoring.

===Online tutoring===
Online tutoring is another way for a student to receive academic help, either scheduled or on-demand. Sessions are done through an application where a student and tutor can communicate. Common tools include chat, whiteboard, web conferencing, teleconferencing, online videos and other specialized applets which make it easier to convey information back and forth. Online tutoring has relatively recently emerged as a mechanism to provide tutoring services in contrast to more traditional in-person teaching. Paired with in-person tutoring, some of the benefits include the opportunity for learning motivation growth for both the tutor and the tutee.

Online tutoring is now a very popular way for students at top higher education institutions to earn money to support their studies during term time, but not all universities are in favour of this.

One of the potential drawbacks of online tutoring stems from the influx or sensory overload of information from different materials. &quot;For example, material presented in multiple modalities run the risk of interrupting the learner from a coherent learning experience, of imposing a “split attention” effect (the mind cannot concentrate on two things simultaneously), or of overloading the learner&#x27;s limited supply of cognitive resources.&quot;

The tutor ensures the development of individual educational programs for students and accompanies the process of individualization and individual education at school, university, in additional education systems.

===Peer tutoring===
Peer tutoring refers to the method of tutoring that involves members of the same peer group teaching or tutoring one another. The characteristics of a peer tutoring group/pairing vary across age, socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity. It has been defined as &quot;a class of practices and strategies that employs peers as one-on-one teachers to provide individualized instruction, practice, repetition, and clarification of concepts&quot;.

==Effects==

===Academic performance===
Studies have found that peer tutoring provides academic benefits for learners across the subject areas of &quot;reading, mathematics, science, and social studies&quot; Peer tutoring has also been found to be an effective teaching method in enhancing the reading comprehension skills of students, especially that of students with a low academic performance at the secondary level in schools. Additionally, peer tutoring has been proven especially useful for those with learning disabilities at the elementary level, while there is mixed evidence showing the effectiveness of peer tutoring for those at the secondary level.

One study suggests that phonologically based reading instruction for first-graders at risk for learning disability can be delivered by non-teachers. In the study, non-certified tutors gave students intensive one-to-one tutoring for 30 minutes, 4 days a week for one school year. The students outperformed untutored control students on measures of reading, spelling, and decoding; with effect sizes ranging from .42 to 1.24. The tutoring included instruction in phonological skills, letter-sound correspondence, explicit decoding, rime analysis, writing, spelling, and reading phonetically controlled text. Although the effects diminished at the end of second grade, the tutored students continued to significantly outperform untutored students in decoding and spelling.

===Economic effects===
Although certain types of tutoring arrangements can require a salary for the tutor, typically tutoring is free of cost and thus financially affordable for learners. The cost-effectiveness of tutoring can prove to be especially beneficial for learners from low-income backgrounds or resource-strapped regions. In contrast, paid tutoring arrangements can create or further highlight socioeconomic disparities between low-income, middle-income and high-income populations. A study found that access to private tutoring was less financially affordable for low-income families, who thus benefited less from private tutoring as compared to high-income populations, who had the resources to profit from private tutoring.

==Issues==

===Tutoring as &quot;shadow education&quot;===
Tutoring has also emerged as a supplement to public and private schooling in many countries. The supplementary nature of tutoring is a feature in the domain of what some scholars have termed &quot;shadow education&quot;. Shadow education has been defined as &quot;a set of educational activities that occur outside formal schooling and are designed to enhance the student&#x27;s formal school career.&quot; The term &quot;shadow&quot; has four components to it: firstly, the existence of and need for tutoring is produced by the existence of the formal education system; secondly, the formal education system is the mainstream system and thus tutoring is its shadow; thirdly, the focus remains on mainstream education in schools; fourthly, tutoring is largely informal and unstructured as compared to formal or mainstream education. As a consequence of the popularity of shadow education, private tutoring can sometimes overshadow mainstream education with more priority given to enrolling in private tutoring centers. Mark Bray claims that &quot;Especially near the time of major external examinations, schools in some countries may be perceived by pupils to be less able to cater for their specific needs.&quot;

===Disproportionate use of tutoring services===
In a 2009 research performed by the Institute of Education Sciences, statistics show that for the 2006–07 years, only 22 percent of students received tutoring services out of the 60 percent of those whose parents reported receiving information about the services. Conversely, only 13 percent of students receive tutoring services out of the 43 percent whose parents reported not receiving information about the services.

==Tutoring agency==
A tutoring agency is a business that acts as an intermediary between people who are looking for tutors and tutors wishing to offer their services. The term tuition agency is an alternative term, used specifically in Singapore and Malaysia.

===Tutoring around the world===
Tutoring agencies are common in many countries including Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, the UAE, the U.K. and the U.S.A., although it is not regulated in most countries.

In the UK, after much discussion in the media, a limited company was set up in October 2013. The Tutors&#x27; Association was previously named The London Association Of Certified Financial Analysts.

In Singapore, tutoring agencies, also known as tuition agencies, are not regulated by the Ministry of Education.

===Controversies===
In Singapore, parents and students have positive as well as negative comments.

Tutoring centers (tuition centers) must be registered with the Singapore Ministry of Education. However, tutoring agencies are not. Instead, tutoring agencies are required to register with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) under the Business Registration Act. There is a history of poor compliance and consumer complaints.

<doc id="299967" wikidata="Q4346838" url="?curid=299967" title="Kleiner Perkins">
<text>Kleiner Perkins, formerly Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), is an American venture capital firm which specializes in investing in incubation, early stage and growth companies. Since its founding in 1972, the firm has backed entrepreneurs in over 900 ventures, including America Online, Amazon.com, Tandem Computers, Compaq, Electronic Arts, JD.com, Square, Genentech, Google, Netscape, Sun Microsystems, Nest, Palo Alto Networks, Synack, Snap, AppDynamics, and Twitter. By 2019 it had raised around $9 billion in 19 venture capital funds and four growth funds.

Kleiner Perkins is headquartered in Menlo Park in Silicon Valley, with offices in San Francisco and Shanghai, China.
The &quot;New York Times&quot; described Kleiner Perkins as &quot;perhaps Silicon Valley&#x27;s most famous venture firm&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called it one of the &quot;largest and most established&quot; venture capital firms and &quot;Dealbook&quot; named it &quot;one of Silicon Valley&#x27;s top venture capital providers.&quot;

== History ==

The firm was formed in 1972 as Kleiner Perkins. When Caufield and Byers became partners as well, the name was changed to Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB) in Menlo Park, California, with a focus on seed, early-stage, and growth companies. The firm is named after its four founding partners: Eugene Kleiner, Tom Perkins, Frank J. Caufield, and Brook Byers. Kleiner was a founder of Fairchild Semiconductor, and Perkins was an early Hewlett-Packard executive. Byers joined in 1977. It was the very first venture capital firm to open an office on Sand Hill Road and is credited with creating the cluster of venture capital firms in that area.
Located in Menlo Park, California, Kleiner Perkins had access to the growing technology industries in the area. By the early 1970s, there were many semiconductor companies based in the Santa Clara Valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies. Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund. Nevertheless, the firm was still active in this period. By 1996, Kleiner Perkins had funded around 260 companies a total of $880 million. Beyond the original founders, notable members of the firm have included individuals such as John Doerr, Vinod Khosla, and Bill Joy.

Colin Powell joined as a &quot;strategic&quot; partner in 2005, while Al Gore joined as a partner in 2007 as part of a collaboration between Kleiner Perkins and Generation Investment Management. Mary Meeker joined the firm in 2010, and that year Kleiner Perkins expanded its practice to invest in growth stage companies. Meeker departed in 2019 to found Bond Capital. Mamoon Hamid from Social Capital and Ilya Fushman from Index Partners joined in 2017 and 2018 respectively, both as investing partners.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; has described Kleiner Perkins as &quot;perhaps Silicon Valley&#x27;s most famous venture firm&quot;. The firm was described by &quot;Dealbook&quot; in 2009 as &quot;one of Silicon Valley&#x27;s top venture capital providers&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2010 called it one of the &quot;largest and most established&quot; venture capital firms. By 2019 it had raised around $9 billion in 19 venture capital funds and four growth funds.

In May 2012, Ellen Pao, an employee, sued the firm for gender discrimination in &quot;Pao v. Kleiner Perkins&quot;, which the firm has vigorously denied. On 27 March 2015, after a month-long trial, the jury found against Pao on all claims. In June 2015, Pao filed an appeal. In September 2015, Pao announced she would no longer appeal the jury verdict.

In September 2018, Kleiner Perkins announced it was spinning out its digital growth team into a new independent firm. The firm announced its 19th fund on 31 January 2019 after raising $600 million. The fund is focused on early stage investments in the &quot;consumer, enterprise, hard tech and fintech&quot; sectors. The firm raised US$600 million for its 18th fund, KP XVIII, in January 2019.

== Investments ==
In March 2008 Kleiner Perkins announced the iFund, a $100 million venture capital investment initiative that funds concepts related to the iPhone, and doubled that investment a year later. It was reported in April 2008 that Kleiner Perkins was raising funds for a $500 million growth-stage clean-technology fund. In October 2010, the firm launched a $250 million fund called sFund to focus on social startups, with co-investors such as Facebook, Zynga and Amazon.com. In early 2016, the firm raised $1.4 billion in KP XVII and DGF III.

In 1999, Kleiner Perkins paid $12 million for a stake in Google. As of 2019, the market cap of Google&#x27;s parent company was estimated at around $831 billion.

<text>Laura Elizabeth Metcalf (born June 16, 1955) is an American actress and comedian. Known for her complex and versatile roles across the stage and screen, she has received various accolades throughout a career spanning more than four decades, including 4 Primetime Emmy Awards and 2 Tony Awards, in addition to nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and three Golden Globe Awards.

Metcalf began her career with the Steppenwolf Theatre Company and frequently works in Chicago theatre. She made her Broadway debut in the 1985 play &quot;My Thing of Love&quot;. She went on to receive 6 Tony Award nominations, winning Best Actress in a Play in 2017 for her performance in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House, Part 2&quot; and Best Featured Actress in a Play for the 2018 revival of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Three Tall Women&quot;. Her other Tony-nominated roles were for &quot;November&quot; (2008), &quot;The Other Place&quot; (2010), &quot;Misery&quot; (2016), and &quot;Hillary and Clinton&quot; (2019).

She gained national attention for her playing Jackie Harris on &quot;Roseanne&quot; (1988–1997, 2018), for which she won 3 Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, and its spinoff &quot;The Conners&quot; (2018–present). She also won a Primetime Emmy Award for her guest role in &quot;Hacks&quot; (2022), and her other Emmy-nominated roles include &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; (1999), &quot;Monk&quot; (2006), &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2007), &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; (2016), &quot;Getting On&quot; (2013–2015), and &quot;Horace and Pete&quot; (2016). She also appeared on &quot;The Norm Show&quot; (1999–2001), &quot;Frasier&quot;, and &quot;The Dropout&quot; (2022)&quot;.

In film, Metcalf is best known for her performance as Marion McPherson in Greta Gerwig&#x27;s comedy-drama film &quot;Lady Bird&quot; (2017). She was nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a SAG Award, and a BAFTA Award. Since 1995, she has voiced Mrs. Davis, the mother of Andy, in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise; she also voiced Sarah Hawkins in the Disney animated film &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002). Other film credits include &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; (1985), &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; (1989), &quot;JFK&quot; (1991), &quot;Dear God&quot; (1996), &quot;Georgia Rule&quot; (2007) and &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997).

==Early life and education==
Metcalf was raised in Edwardsville, Illinois, which she has said &quot;isn&#x27;t anywhere near a theatre.&quot; Her father, James, was the budget director at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville at the time of his sudden death in 1984. Her mother, Libby, was a librarian. Her great-aunt was the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Zoë Akins.

Metcalf is an alumna of Illinois State University, class of 1976. Metcalf worked as a secretary while in college and has said that she enjoyed seeing a pile of paper in the to-do box on one side of her desk move over to the completed side by the end of the day. She was often so focused on her work she missed lunch. She originally majored in German, thinking she could work as an interpreter, and then in anthropology before accepting that majoring in theatre was her true passion. She has said that theatre work also involves interpreting and studying human behavior. She has described herself as hideously shy, and yet she found the courage to audition for a few plays in high school and was &quot;hooked&quot;. She initially did not choose acting as a career, because it was unlikely to lead to regular work.

==Career==

=== 1976–1987: Rise to prominence ===

Metcalf attended Illinois State University and earned her Bachelor of Arts in Theater in 1976. While at ISU, she met fellow theater students, among them John Malkovich, Glenne Headly, Joan Allen, Terry Kinney, and Jeff Perry, the latter two of whom, along with Perry&#x27;s high school classmate Gary Sinise, went on to establish Chicago&#x27;s Steppenwolf Theatre Company. Metcalf began her professional career at Steppenwolf, of which she was a charter member. Metcalf went to New York to appear in an Off-Broadway Steppenwolf production of &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot; at Circle Repertory in 1984 for which she received the 1984 Obie Award for Best Actress and a 1984–85 Theatre World Award (for best debut in a Broadway or Off-Broadway performance). Metcalf was praised for her performance as Darlene, and was specifically singled out for her 20-minute act two monologue. Chicago critic Richard Christiansen stated:

Metcalf has appeared in several television series, including being a cast member for a single episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;—the final episode of the show&#x27;s tumultuous 1980–1981 season. In 1981, she appeared as a feature player on the first Dick Ebersol-produced episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; following the firing of Jean Doumanian. She appeared in a &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment about taking a bullet for the president of the United States. Because of the sketch show&#x27;s perceived severe decline in quality at the time and the 1981 Writers Guild of America strike, the show was put on hiatus for retooling. Metcalf was not asked to return as a cast member the following year.

Metcalf&#x27;s first on-screen appearance was an uncredited role as a maid in Robert Altman&#x27;s comedy &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978). During the 1980s, Metcalf performed supporting roles in many popular films, including the Susan Seidelman comedies &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; (1985) and &quot;Making Mr. Right&quot; (1987), Gary Sinise&#x27;s drama &quot;Miles from Home&quot; (1988), the Pat O&#x27;Connor comedy &quot;Stars and Bars&quot; (1988), and John Hughes&#x27; comedy film &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; (1989).

=== 1988–1998: &quot;Roseanne&quot; and recognition ===

In 1988, Metcalf debuted in what is arguably her best known role as Jackie Harris, the multiple-careered, low self-esteemed, amiable sister of the title character in the hit ABC sitcom series &quot;Roseanne&quot;, starring alongside Roseanne Barr and John Goodman. Her performance garnered four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, a category that she won three consecutive times, from 1992 to 1994. &quot;Roseanne&quot; ran through 1997; Metcalf appeared as Jackie over the show&#x27;s entire nine-season run.

Throughout the 1990s, she played against type in a series of darker films, such as the John Schlesinger psychological thriller &quot;Pacific Heights&quot; (1990), Mike Figgis&#x27;s thriller &quot;Internal Affairs&quot; (1990), the Hollywood dramedy &quot;Mistress&quot; (1992), the romantic drama &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot; (1993), Michael Apted&#x27;s neo-noir thriller &quot;Blink&quot; (1994), and reuniting with Figgis in his Oscar-winning drama &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; (1995). She also played minor roles in Warren Beatty&#x27;s political drama &quot;Bulworth&quot; (1998) and the Garry Marshall romantic comedy &quot;Runaway Bride&quot; (1999). 

Her biggest film role of the decade was as Susie Cox, one of Jim Garrison&#x27;s chief investigators, in Oliver Stone&#x27;s historical epic &quot;JFK&quot; (1991). During this time, she also had a series of guest-starring roles on shows such as &quot;Duckman&quot; (1995–1996), &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (1997), &quot;Life with Louie&quot; (1997), &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot; (1997), and &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; (1998), the last of which brought her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.

=== 1999–2007: Established actress ===
From 1999 to 2001, Metcalf costarred with Norm Macdonald on &quot;The Norm Show&quot; (later known as &quot;Norm&quot;), which ran for three seasons (1999–2001), and later starred opposite Nathan Lane in the 2003 comedy series &quot;Charlie Lawrence&quot;, which was cancelled after the airing of two episodes. In 2008, Metcalf starred in The CW dramedy &quot;Easy Money&quot;, as the matriarch of a family of loan sharks. The series was canceled after three episodes. Through this period, Metcalf had guest-starring roles on series such as &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; (as Susan Welker, Lois&#x27; younger sister), &quot;My Boys&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Portlandia&quot;, &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, the last of which she played opposite her ex-husband Jeff Perry. Her work on the Tony Shalhoub-led &quot;Monk&quot; and the ABC ensemble comedy drama &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; earned her a further two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.

Metcalf voiced Andy&#x27;s mother in the Disney-Pixar animated film &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995), reprising the role in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999), &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010), and &quot;Toy Story 4&quot; (2019). All four films were huge financial and critical successes, grossing well over a collective billion dollars. In 1997, she portrayed Debbie Salt in the horror film &quot;Scream 2&quot;. She made a brief foray into television films in the late 1990s, portraying the real-life gun control activist Carolyn McCarthy in the NBC film &quot;The Long Island Incident&quot; (1998).

In the 2000s, Metcalf became known mostly for her voice work in film. In 2002, she voiced Sarah Hawkins in the Disney animated &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002). Despite the film receiving positive reviews, the film was a financial box office failure. In 2007, she voiced Lucille Krunklehorn-Robinson in the Disney animated film &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot;. The film, like &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;, was met with mixed reviews. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot; is surely one of the worst theatrically released animated features issued under the Disney label in quite some time&quot;. Metcalf did not feature in many live action films during this period but she did appear in the raunchy comedy &quot;Beer League&quot; (2006), the Jim Carrey-led comedy remake &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; (2005), the coming-of-age drama &quot;Georgia Rule&quot; (2006) with Jane Fonda and Lindsay Lohan, and the war drama &quot;Stop Loss&quot; (2008) with Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

In 2007, Metcalf made her first appearance as Mary Cooper, the mother of Sheldon Cooper, one of the main characters, on the top-rated CBS sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;. She would reprise the role repeatedly over its twelve-season run, and in 2016, her performance earned Metcalf her fourth nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Her daughter Zoe Perry portrays a younger version of Mary in the spinoff prequel series &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;.

=== 2008–2019: Broadway roles and &quot;Lady Bird&quot; ===
Metcalf ultimately relocated to New York City and began to work in theatrical productions such as David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;November&quot; on Broadway in 2008, for which she received a Tony Award nomination. In June 2009, Metcalf starred in Justin Tanner&#x27;s play &quot;Voice Lessons&quot; with French Stewart in Hollywood before beginning rehearsals to play Kate Jerome in the Broadway revival of Neil Simon&#x27;s semi-autobiographical plays &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot; and &quot;Broadway Bound&quot;, directed by David Cromer. The former production&#x27;s run, however, lasted for nine performances in October 2009, and the latter was canceled before opening. &quot;Voice Lessons&quot;, with its original cast intact, went on to run three more times — one Off-Broadway in May 2010, another in Hollywood in May 2011, and another in Chicago in May 2016. In September 2010, Metcalf returned to Steppenwolf and starred in Lisa D&#x27;Amour&#x27;s play &quot;Detroit&quot;. In 2011, she appeared in the Off-Broadway play &quot;The Other Place&quot; by Sharr White, directed by Joe Mantello. She won the 2011 Lucille Lortel Award, Outstanding Lead Actress, and the 2011 Obie Award, for her performance.

In 2012, Metcalf joined David Suchet in a West End production of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Actress. In 2013, &quot;The Other Place&quot; transferred to Broadway with Metcalf reprising her role and earning Tony and Drama League nominations. She starred with her real-life daughter, Zoe Perry. In 2013, Metcalf starred in Bruce Norris&#x27;s Off-Broadway play &quot;Domesticated&quot; with Jeff Goldblum at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater of Lincoln Center. She was nominated for the 2014 Drama League Award, Distinguished Performance and the 2014 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play for her performance. 

From 2013 to 2015, Metcalf starred in the HBO comedy series &quot;Getting On&quot;. She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for its final season, losing to Julia Louis-Dreyfus of &quot;Veep&quot;. She was also the lead actress in the short-lived CBS family sitcom &quot;The McCarthys&quot; (2014–15). In 2015, she took the role of Annie Wilkes in the Broadway production of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Misery&quot;, opposite Bruce Willis. The play premiered on November 15, 2015, at the Broadhurst Theatre. It received mixed reviews from critics, but Metcalf&#x27;s performance was widely acclaimed. She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, her third Tony nomination overall.

In 2016, Metcalf took a dramatic turn in the third episode of Louis C.K.&#x27;s self-funded show &quot;Horace and Pete&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Matt Brenann of &quot;IndieWire&quot; praised Metcalf&#x27;s performance: &quot;Metcalf&#x27;s inflections and expressions [are the narrative&#x27;s] central characters; C.K.&#x27;s unflinching direction drinks her performance to the lees, to the point that Sarah&#x27;s recollection of an afternoon sunbathing bristles with suspense, approaching the edge of some invisible precipice.&quot; On April 28, 2017, it was announced that a revival of &quot;Roseanne&quot; was in the works and that Metcalf along with most of the original cast and some of the producers would return for the limited series that was being shopped around with ABC and Netflix the frontrunners to land the show. On May 16, 2017, producers confirmed that eight episodes would air mid-season in 2018 on ABC. On May 29, 2018, in the wake of racist remarks by Barr posted on Twitter regarding former president Barack Obama&#x27;s advisor Valerie Jarrett, ABC cancelled the revival after a single season. Metcalf reprised her role in &quot;The Conners&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;Roseanne&quot; without Barr&#x27;s involvement which premiered in fall 2018. In 2018, Metcalf&#x27;s portrayal of Jackie Harris earned a fifth Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series nomination for her work on the revival of &quot;Roseanne.&quot;

Metcalf appeared on Broadway in Lucas Hnath&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House, Part 2&quot; with Chris Cooper at the John Golden Theatre. which opened in April 2017. She received critical acclaim for her performance and earned her first Tony Award, winning for Best Actress in a Play. In 2017, Metcalf received universal critical acclaim for her performance in Greta Gerwig&#x27;s coming of age film &quot;Lady Bird&quot; starring alongside Saoirse Ronan and Tracy Letts. For her performance, she was nominated for numerous awards, including the Academy Award, Golden Globe, SAG, BAFTA, Critics Choice and the Independent Spirit Award. The following year Metcalf performed in the Broadway revival of &quot;Three Tall Women&quot; with Glenda Jackson and Allison Pill at the John Golden Theatre in 2018. She won her second consecutive Tony Award, this time for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Metcalf played Hillary Clinton opposite John Lithgow as Bill Clinton in Lucas Hnath&#x27;s &quot;Hillary and Clinton&quot; on Broadway in 2019 at the John Golden Theatre. The play was directed by Joe Mantello and tells a fictional account of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. It ran April 18, 2019, through June 23, 2019. Metcalf was nominated for the 2019 Tony Award, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Play.

=== 2020–present===
In 2020, Metcalf began performances in the Broadway revival of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; playing Martha. The production was directed by Joe Mantello and Metcalf starred alongside Rupert Everett. The play ran at the Booth Theatre from March 3, 2020, to March 11, 2020. The production was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic with no planned return date. It was reported in February 2020 that Metcalf would be starring in a Broadway revival of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; opposite Nathan Lane, though this has not come to fruition. In 2022 she portrayed Phyllis Gardner in the Hulu limited series &quot;The Dropout&quot; starring Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes. That same year she acted in the HBO Max series &quot;Hacks&quot; (2022) for which she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.

Metcalf returned to Broadway in April 2023 in the play &quot;Grey House&quot;, which ran until July 30, 2023. Metcalf costarred in Ray Romano&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Somewhere in Queens&quot; (2023).

Metcalf later began a relationship with Matt Roth, the &quot;Roseanne&quot; co-star who played her abusive boyfriend Fisher. By November 1993, they had a son and eventually married. They also worked together on occasion, including in the 1994 feature film thriller &quot;Blink&quot; and the 1998 drama &quot;Chicago Cab&quot;; they also appeared together in an episode of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;.

<text>A college-preparatory school (usually shortened to preparatory school or prep school) is a type of secondary school. The term refers to public, private independent or parochial schools primarily designed to prepare students for higher education.

==Japan==
In Japan, college-prep schools are called &quot;Shingakukō&quot; , which means a school used to progress into another school. Prep schools in Japan are usually considered prestigious and are often difficult to get into. However, there are many tiers of prep schools, the entry into which depends on the university that the school leads into.

Japanese prep schools started as , secondary schools for boys, which were founded after the secondary school law in 1886. Later, , secondary school for girls (1891), and , vocational schools (1924), were included among and were legally regarded as schools on the same level as a school for boys. However, graduates from those two types of schools had more requirements for college entrance. In the modern period, many Japanese secondary schools were five-year schools, except for during a short term from 1943 to 1946. 

The social status of , or , secondary schools for boys under the old system, did not disappear even after the new system (6-3-3) took effect in 1947. Many are six-year schools. Many have their origins in and , or ones attached to universities. Japanese pupils who aspire to a prep school education take written examinations in sixth grade in each prep school. 

Unlike six-year prep schools, the top municipal senior high school (three-year schools) in each school zone and some high-ranked private senior high schools (ditto) are also regarded as . In the 21st century, some trial cases connecting public junior and senior high schools are seen in each region, too, broadening the education for college entrance. As the Japanese government provides grant-in-aid to private schools, the tuition is 5,000–10,000 US dollars per year, even if it is a private school. 

==United States==

In the United States, there are public, private, and charter college-preparatory schools that can be either parochial or secular. Admission is sometimes based on specific selection criteria, usually academic, but some schools have open enrollment. In 2017, 5.7 million students were enrolled in US private elementary or secondary schools, constituting 10% of total school enrollment. Of those, 1.4 million students were enrolled in a secular (nonsectarian) school.
Public and charter college preparatory schools are typically connected to a local school district and draw from the entire district instead of the closest school zone. Some offer specialized courses or curricula that prepare students for a specific field of study. In contrast, others use the label as a promotional tool without offering programs different from a conventional high school.
Preparatory schools began before the Civil War, when there were no public schools above the grammar school or elementary level anywhere in the US. Their graduates were not ready for college study, so many colleges set up &quot;preparatory academies&quot; to prepare them for college study. The preparatory division could dwarf the college enrollment, as at New York Central College. There were also preparatory schools unaffiliated with colleges, especially for girls, such as the Columbia Female Academy. At the time, men and women did not study together at any level, and there were no women&#x27;s colleges. Some of the female preparatory schools became women&#x27;s colleges after the Civil War.

Free high school level education for all became available in the later 19th and early 20th centuries. Since then, the surviving &quot;prep schools&quot; in the US are primarily private, elite institutions that have very selective admission criteria and high tuition fees, catering to students in the 13–18 age range. Little financial aid other than loans is available. Prep schools can be day schools, boarding schools, or both, and may be co-educational or single-sex. Currently, day schools are more common than boarding, and since the 1970s, co-educational schools have been more common than single-sex. Unlike the public schools which are free, they charge tuition ($10,000 to 40,000+ a year in 2014). Some prep schools are affiliated with a particular religious denomination. Unlike parochial (Catholic) schools, independent preparatory schools are not governed by a religious organization, and students are usually not required to receive instruction in one particular religion. While independent prep schools in the United States are not subject to government oversight or regulation, many are accredited by one of the six regional accreditation agencies for educational institutions.

<text>A sedative or tranquilliser is a substance that induces sedation by reducing irritability or excitement. They are central nervous system (CNS) depressants and interact with brain activity causing its deceleration. Various kinds of sedatives can be distinguished, but the majority of them affect the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Most sedatives produce relaxing effects by increasing GABA activity.

This group is related to hypnotics. The term &quot;sedative&quot; describes drugs that serve to calm or relieve anxiety, whereas the term &quot;hypnotic&quot; describes drugs whose main purpose is to initiate, sustain, or lengthen sleep. Because these two functions frequently overlap, and because drugs in this class generally produce dose-dependent effects (ranging from anxiolysis to loss of consciousness), they are often referred to collectively as &quot;sedative–hypnotic&quot; drugs.

==Terminology==
There is some overlap between the terms &quot;sedative&quot; and &quot;hypnotic&quot;.

Advances in pharmacology have permitted more specific targeting of receptors, and greater selectivity of agents, which necessitates greater precision when describing these agents and their effects:
* &quot;Anxiolytic&quot; refers specifically to the effect upon anxiety. (However, some benzodiazepines can be all three: sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics).
* &quot;Tranquiliser&quot; can refer to anxiolytics or antipsychotics.

=== &quot;Chemical cosh&quot; ===
The term &quot;chemical cosh&quot; (&quot;cosh&quot; being a term for a blunt weapon such as a club) is sometimes used colloquially for a strong sedative, particularly for:
* Widespread dispensation of antipsychotic drugs in residential care to make people with dementia easier to manage.

===Types of sedatives===
==Therapeutic use==
Doctors and veterinarians often administer sedatives to patients in order to dull the patient&#x27;s anxiety related to painful or anxiety-provoking procedures. Although sedatives do not relieve pain, they can be a useful adjunct to analgesics in preparing patients for surgery, and are commonly given to patients before they are anaesthetized, or before other highly uncomfortable and invasive procedures like cardiac catheterization, endoscopy, colonoscopy.

== Risks ==

===Sedative dependence===
Some sedatives can cause psychological and physical dependence when taken regularly over a period of time, even at therapeutic doses. Dependent users may get withdrawal symptoms ranging from restlessness and insomnia to convulsions and death. When users become psychologically dependent, they feel as if they need the drug to function, although physical dependence does not necessarily occur, particularly with a short course of use. In both types of dependencies, finding and using the sedative becomes the focus in life. Both physical and psychological dependence can be treated with therapy.

===Misuse===


Many sedatives can be misused, but barbiturates and benzodiazepines are responsible for most of the problems with sedative use due to their widespread recreational or non-medical use. People who have difficulty dealing with stress, anxiety or sleeplessness may overuse or become dependent on sedatives. Some heroin users may take them either to supplement their drug or to substitute for it. Stimulant users may take sedatives to calm excessive jitteriness. Others take sedatives recreationally to relax and forget their worries. Barbiturate overdose is a factor in nearly one-third of all reported drug-related deaths. These include suicides and accidental drug poisonings. Benzodiazepines comparatively have a wider margin of safety and rarely result in overdose unless mixed with other CNS depressants. Accidental deaths sometimes occur when a drowsy, confused user repeats doses, or when sedatives are taken with alcohol.

A study from the United States found that in 2011, sedatives and hypnotics were a leading source of adverse drug events (ADEs) seen in the hospital setting: Approximately 2.8% of all ADEs present on admission and 4.4% of ADEs that originated during a hospital stay were caused by a sedative or hypnotic drug. A second study noted that a total of 70,982 sedative exposures were reported to U.S. poison control centers in 1998, of which 2310 (3.2%) resulted in major toxicity and 89 (0.1%) resulted in death. About half of all the people admitted to emergency rooms in the U.S. as a result of nonmedical use of sedatives have a legitimate prescription for the drug, but have taken an excessive dose or combined it with alcohol or other drugs.

There are also serious paradoxical reactions that may occur in conjunction with the use of sedatives that lead to unexpected results in some individuals. Malcolm Lader at the Institute of Psychiatry in London estimates the incidence of these adverse reactions at about 5%, even in short-term use of the drugs. The paradoxical reactions may consist of depression, with or without suicidal tendencies, phobias, aggressiveness, violent behavior and symptoms sometimes misdiagnosed as psychosis.

===Dangers of combining sedatives and alcohol===

Sedatives and alcohol are sometimes combined recreationally or carelessly. Since alcohol is a strong depressant that slows brain function and depresses respiration, the two substances compound each other&#x27;s actions and this combination can prove fatal.

=== Worsening of psychiatric symptoms ===
The long-term use of benzodiazepines may have a similar effect on the brain as alcohol, and are also implicated in depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mania, psychosis, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunction, delirium, and neurocognitive disorders (including benzodiazepine-induced persisting dementia which persists even after the medications are stopped). As with alcohol, the effects of benzodiazepines on neurochemistry, such as decreased levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, are believed to be responsible for their effects on mood and anxiety. Additionally, benzodiazepines can indirectly cause or worsen other psychiatric symptoms (e.g., mood, anxiety, psychosis, irritability) by worsening sleep (i.e., benzodiazepine-induced sleep disorder). Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat insomnia in the short-term (both prescribed and self-medicated), but worsen sleep in the long-term. While benzodiazepines can put people to sleep, they disrupt sleep architecture: decreasing sleep time, delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep slow-wave sleep (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood).

=== Dementia ===
Sedatives and hypnotics should be avoided in people with dementia, according to the medication appropriateness tool for co‐morbid health conditions in dementia criteria. The use of these medications can further impede cognitive function for people with dementia, who are also more sensitive to side effects of medications.

===Amnesia===
Sedatives can sometimes leave the patient with long-term or short-term amnesia.
Lorazepam is one such pharmacological agent that can cause anterograde amnesia. Intensive care unit patients who receive higher doses over longer periods, typically via IV drip, are more likely to experience such side effects.
Additionally, the prolonged use of tranquilizers increases the risk of obsessive and compulsive disorder, where the person becomes unaware whether he has performed a scheduled activity or not, he may also repetitively perform tasks and still re-performs the same task trying to make-up for continuous doubts. Remembering names that were earlier known becomes an issue such that the memory loss becomes apparent.

===Disinhibition and crime===
Sedatives — most commonly alcohol, but also GHB, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), and to a lesser extent, temazepam (Restoril) and midazolam (Versed) — have been reported for their use as date rape drugs (also called a Mickey Finn) and being administered to unsuspecting patrons in bars or guests at parties to reduce the intended victims&#x27; defenses.

Statistical overviews suggest that the use of sedative-spiked drinks for robbing people is actually much more common than their use for rape. Cases of criminals taking Rohypnol themselves before they commit crimes have also been reported, as the loss of inhibitions from the drug may increase their confidence to commit the offense, and the amnesia produced by the drug makes it difficult for police to interrogate them if they are caught.

<text>Lebensborn e.V. (literally: &quot;Fount of Life&quot;) was a secret, SS-initiated, state-registered association in Nazi Germany with the stated goal of increasing the number of children born who met the Nazi standards of &quot;racially pure&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; Aryans, based on Nazi eugenics (also called &quot;racial hygiene&quot; by some eugenicists). &quot;Lebensborn&quot; was established by Heinrich Himmler, and provided welfare to its mostly unmarried mothers, encouraged anonymous births by unmarried women at their maternity homes, and mediated adoption of children by likewise &quot;racially pure&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; parents, particularly SS members and their families. The Cross of Honour of the German Mother was given to the women who bore the most Aryan children. Abortion was legalized (and, more commonly, endorsed) by the Nazis for disabled and non-Germanic children, but strictly punished otherwise.

Set up in Germany in 1935, &quot;Lebensborn&quot; expanded into several occupied European countries with Germanic populations during the World War II. It included the selection of &quot;racially worthy&quot; orphans for adoption and care for children born from Aryan women who had been in relationships with SS members. It originally excluded children born from unions between common soldiers and foreign women, because there was no proof of &quot;racial purity&quot; on both sides. During the war, many children were kidnapped from their parents and judged by Aryan criteria for their suitability to be raised in &quot;Lebensborn&quot; homes, and fostered by German families.

At the Nuremberg trials, much direct evidence was found of the kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany during the period 1939–1945.

==History==

===Background===
The &quot;Lebensborn e.V.&quot; (e.V. stands for &quot;eingetragener Verein&quot; or registered association), meaning &quot;fount of life&quot;, was founded on 12 December 1935, to counteract falling birth rates in Germany, and to promote Nazi eugenics. Located in Munich, the organization was partly an office within the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) responsible for certain family welfare programs, and partly a society for Nazi leaders.

On 13 September 1936, Heinrich Himmler wrote the following to members of the SS:

In 1939, membership stood at 8,000, of which 3,500 were SS leaders.
The &quot;Lebensborn&quot; office was part of &quot;SS Rasse und Siedlungshauptamt&quot; (SS Race and Settlement Main Office) until 1938, when it was transferred to &quot;Hauptamt Persönlicher Stab Reichsführer-SS&quot; (Personal Staff of the &quot;Reichführer&quot;-SS), i.e. directly overseen by Himmler. Leaders of &quot;Lebensborn e. V.&quot; were &quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; and &quot;SS-Oberführer&quot; Dr. Gregor Ebner.

===Implementation===
Initially the programme served as a welfare institution for wives of SS officers; the organization ran facilitiesprimarily maternity homeswhere women could give birth or get help with family matters. The programme also accepted unmarried women who were either pregnant or had already given birth and were in need of aid, provided that both the woman and the father of the child were classified as &quot;racially valuable&quot;. About 60% of the mothers were unmarried. The program allowed them to give birth secretly away from home without social stigma. In case the mothers wanted to give up the children, the program also had orphanages and an adoption service. When dealing with non-SS members, parents and children were usually examined by SS doctors before admission.

The first &quot;Lebensborn&quot; home (known as &quot;Heim Hochland&quot;) opened in 1936, in Steinhöring, a tiny village not far from Munich. The first home outside of Germany opened in Norway in 1941. Many of these facilities were established in confiscated houses and former nursing homes owned by Jews. Leaders of the League of German Girls were instructed to recruit young women with the potential to become good breeding partners for SS officers.

While &quot;Lebensborn e. V.&quot; established facilities in several occupied countries, its activities were concentrated around Germany, Norway and occupied northeastern Europe, mainly Poland. The main focus in occupied Norway was aiding children born to Norwegian women and fathered by German soldiers. In northeastern Europe the organisation, in addition to services provided to SS members, engaged in the transfer of children, mostly orphans, to families in Germany.

&quot;Lebensborn e. V.&quot; had or planned to have facilities in the following countries (some were merely field offices):
* Germany: 10
* Austria: 3
* Poland (General Governmentthe occupied Polish territory and annexed lands of Poland): 6 (8 if Stettin and Bad Polzin are included.)
* Norway: 9
* Denmark: 2
* France: 1 (February 1944August 1944)in Lamorlaye
* Belgium: 1 (March 1943September 1944)in Wégimont, in the municipality of Soumagne
* Netherlands: 1
* Luxembourg: 1

About 8,000 children were born in &quot;Lebensborn&quot; homes in Germany, and between 8,000 and 12,000 children in Norway. Elsewhere the total number of births was much lower.

In Norway the &quot;Lebensborn&quot; organisation handled approximately 250 adoptions. In most of these cases the mothers had agreed to the adoption, but not all were informed that their children would be sent to Germany for adoption. The Norwegian government recovered only 170 of these children after the war.

===Germanisation===


In 1939, the Nazis started to kidnap children from foreign countriesmainly from Yugoslavia and Poland, but also Russia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, and Norway for the &quot;Lebensborn&quot; program. They started to do this because &quot;It is our duty to take [the children] with us to remove them from their environment ... either we win over any good blood that we can use for ourselves and give it a place in our people or we destroy this blood,&quot; Himmler reportedly said.

The Nazis would seize children in full view of the parents. The kidnapped children were administered several tests and were categorised into three groups:
* Those considered desirable to be included into the German population.
* Those who were acceptable.
* The unwanted.

The children classified as unwanted were taken to concentration camps to work or were killed. The children from the other groups, if between the ages of 2 and 6, were placed with families in the programme to be brought up by them in a kind of foster child status. Children of ages 6 to 12 were placed in German boarding schools. The schools assigned the children new German names and taught them to be proud to be part of Germany. They forced the children to forget their birth parents and erased any records of their ancestry. Those who resisted Germanisation were beaten and, if a child continued to rebel, he or she would be sent to a concentration camp.

In the final stages of the war, the files of all children kidnapped for the programme were destroyed. As a result, researchers have found it nearly impossible to learn how many children were taken. The Polish government has claimed that 10,000 children were kidnapped, and less than 15% were returned to their biological parents. Other estimates include numbers as high as 200,000, although according to Dirk Moses a more likely number is around 20,000.

===Post-war===
====Kidnapping charges====
After the war, the branch of the &quot;Lebensborn&quot; organisation operating in north-eastern Europe was accused of kidnapping children deemed &quot;racially valuable&quot; in order to resettle them with German families. However, of approximately 10,000 foreign-born children located after the war in the American-controlled area of Germany, in the trial of the leaders of the &quot;Lebensborn&quot; organisation (&quot;United States of America v. Ulrich Greifelt, et al.&quot;), the court found that 340 had been handled by &quot;Lebensborn e. V.&quot; The accused were acquitted on charges of kidnapping.

The court found ample evidence of an existing programme of the kidnapping or forced movement of children in north-eastern Europe, but concluded that these activities were carried out by individuals who were not members of &quot;Lebensborn&quot;. Exactly how many children were moved by &quot;Lebensborn&quot; or other organisations remains unknown due to the destruction of archives by SS members prior to fleeing the advancing Allied forces.

From the trial&#x27;s transcript:

The prosecution has failed to prove with the requisite certainty the participation of &quot;Lebensborn&quot;, and the defendants connected there with in the kidnapping programme conducted by the Nazis. While the evidence has disclosed that thousands upon thousands of children were unquestionably kidnapped by other agencies or organisations and brought into Germany, the evidence has further disclosed that only a small percentage of the total number ever found their way into &quot;Lebensborn&quot;. And of this number only in isolated instances did &quot;Lebensborn&quot; take children who had a living parent. The majority of those children in any way connected with &quot;Lebensborn&quot; were orphans of ethnic Germans.

Upon the evidence submitted, the defendant Sollmann is found not guilty on counts one and two of the indictment.

====Treatment of children====
After Germany&#x27;s surrender, the press reported on the unusually good weight and health of the &quot;super babies&quot;. They spent time outdoors in sunlight and received two baths a day. Everything that came into contact with the babies was disinfected first. Nurses ensured that the children ate everything given to them. Until the last days of the war, the mothers and the children at maternity homes got the best treatment available, including food, although others in the area were starving. Once the war ended, local communities often took revenge on the women, beating them, cutting off their hair, and running them out of the community. Many &quot;Lebensborn&quot; children were born to unwed mothers. After the war, &quot;Lebensborn&quot; survivors were often subjected to ostracization.

====False assumptions====
Himmler&#x27;s effort to secure a &quot;racially pure&quot; Greater Germany, sloppy journalism on the subject, as well as Nazi ideology retained by some, led to persistent false assumptions about the programme. The main misconception was that the programme involved coercive breeding. The first stories reporting that &quot;Lebensborn&quot; was a coercive breeding programme can be found in the German magazine &quot;Revue&quot;, which ran a series on the subject in the 1950s.

The programme did intend to promote the growth of Aryan populations, through encouraging relationships between German soldiers and Nordic women in occupied countries. Access to &quot;Lebensborn&quot; was restricted in accordance with the Nordicist eugenic and racial policies of Nazism, which could be referred to as supervised selective breeding. Recently discovered records and ongoing testimony of &quot;Lebensborn&quot; childrenand some of their parentsshows that some SS men did sire children in Himmler&#x27;s &quot;Lebensborn&quot; program. This was widely rumored within Germany during the period of the programme.

==Self-help groups and aftermath==
In Norway, children born to Norwegian mothers by German fathers were allegedly often bullied, raped, abused, and persecuted by the government after the war, and placed in mental institutions. The Norwegian government attempted to deport &quot;Lebensborn&quot; children to Germany, Brazil, and Australia but did not succeed. A group of &quot;Lebensborn&quot; children sought compensation from the Norwegian government, which they saw as being complicit in their mistreatment. In 2008, their case before the European Court of Human Rights was dismissed as the events had happened too long ago, but they were each offered an £8,000 payment from the Norwegian government.

ABBA member Anni-Frid Lyngstad had a German soldier father and although not a part of the Lebensborn program, she and her family faced the same retributions in post war Norway. They escaped persecution when Anni-Frid&#x27;s maternal grandmother took her to Sweden. Lyngstad grew up believing her father had died in the war, before her birth and she only discovered he was still alive in the late 1970&#x27;s. She met him but after initial happiness, found it difficult to bond with him after so much time.

In November 2006, in the German town of Wernigerode, an open meeting took place among several &quot;Lebensborn&quot; children, with the intention of dispelling myths and encouraging those affected to investigate their origins.

General documents on &quot;Lebensborn&quot; activities are administered by International Tracing Service and by German Federal Archives. The association &quot;Verein kriegskind.de&quot; is among those that published search efforts (&quot;Suchbitten&quot;) to identify &quot;Lebensborn&quot; children.

Several of the surviving &quot;Lebensborn&quot; children appeared in &quot;Wars Don&#x27;t End&quot;, a 2018 documentary film directed by Dheeraj Akolkar and narrated by Liv Ullmann.

==In popular culture==

The Czech TV film &quot;Spring of Life&quot; (2000) tells the story of a Sudeten German teenager recruited as a future mother into a &quot;Lebensborn&quot; in Poland.

In the television series, &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, Joe Blake and Nicole Dörmer are among several characters who were &quot;Lebensborn&quot; children.

The video game &quot;My Child Lebensborn&quot;, which won the BAFTA Games Awards in 2018 for &quot;Game Beyond Entertainment&quot;, lets players experience the bullying &quot;Lebensborn&quot; children went through after the war.

In the novel and film &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;, Sophie unsuccessfully attempts to place her son in the &quot;Lebensborn&quot; program.
