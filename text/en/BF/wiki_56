<text>Homer Martin Adkins (October 15, 1890 – February 26, 1964) was an American businessman and Democratic politician who served as the 32nd Governor of Arkansas. Adkins is remembered as a skilled retail politician and a strong states&#x27; rights proponent and social conservative who served as governor during a period when Arkansas departed from several national economic and societal trends. The Adkins administration fought federal influence in Arkansas during the post-New Deal era; successfully courting federal wartime production investment, during World War II, while battling the federal resettlement of Japanese-Americans in the state and Supreme Court civil rights decisions.

The Adkins administration was, in several ways, a forerunner to years of segregationist governors in Arkansas and across the South; most famously Alabama Governor George Wallace. The former Ku Klux Klan member fought the post-World War II civil rights gains made by African-Americans and sought to organize a constitutional convention to restore the white primary after the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Smith vs. Allwright&quot; decision. Derided as &quot;Holy Homer&quot; by opponents, Adkins&#x27; strong brand of social conservativism earned formidable opposition from moderates and more progressive politicians, like preceding governor-turned rival Carl E. Bailey, as well as pro-gambling interests in the Arkansas resort town of Hot Springs. After leaving office, Adkins remained an influential voice in state politics, assisting later governors Sid McMath and Orval Faubus.

==Early life, education, and military service ==
He was born near Jacksonville in Pulaski County to Ulysses and Lorena ( Wood) Adkins. He graduated from Little Rock High School in 1907 and Draughon&#x27;s Business College in 1909. Adkins began working at Snodgrass &amp; Bracy Drug Company in 1910, graduating from the Little Rock College of Pharmacy in 1911 as a licensed pharmacist. The Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy granted Adkins special permission to practice for the six months before his 21st birthday.

Adkins began studying law in 1915, but enlisted in the United States Army during World War I. He rose from a private to a captain in the Medical Corps. Adkins won election as secretary of the Young Men&#x27;s Democratic Club in 1916. At Camp Beauregard, Adkins met his future wife Estelle Smith; they were wed December 21, 1921. Smith was a Red Cross United States Army nurse, and both were later stationed in France as part of the American Expeditionary Force.

==Early political career==
===Pulaski County Sheriff===

Following return from service in France, Adkins sought the office of Pulaski County sheriff in November 1922. At the time, the sheriff and collector positions were combined. During the Solid South, the Democratic Party held firm control of virtually every office in The South, including Arkansas. Winning the Democratic primary was considered tantamount to election, with several different factions of the party, sometimes including the Ku Klux Klan, battling in the open primaries.

With support of the Klan, Adkins won a two-year term beginning January 1926, and won reelection in November 1924, but did not win his November 1926 reelection bid. During his time at the Pulaski County Courthouse, Adkins would clash with Sixth Circuit Deputy Prosecutor Carl E. Bailey, igniting a feud that would impact Arkansas politics for the next several decades. He returned to private enterprise in 1927, working for the Adkins-Williams Fire Insurance Company until 1933. He remained active in Democratic politics, and served on the Little Rock City Council from 1929 to 1933.

===Collector for Internal Revenue===
He campaigned for Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 election. Under the system of political patronage underway at the time, Senator Joseph T. Robinson was responsible for rewarding supporters with statewide positions in Arkansas. Adkins was reported to be seeking a post at the United States Marshal&#x27;s office in Little Rock. Instead appointed as collector for internal revenue in Arkansas in July 1933, Adkins was responsible for educating taxpayers about new taxes and levies ordered at the national level, as well as implementing the collection and enforcing penalties for unpaid taxes.

As the New Deal agencies multiplied under the first 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency, businesses and individuals required more guidance to navigate the growing federal bureaucracy. In 1934, Adkins traveled the agricultural parts of the state discussing a new measure impacting cotton ginners. He spoke to local civic groups like Lions Club and Rotary Club and business groups about the changing federal tax system, and held meetings with the public and local potentates. Implementation of the United States&#x27; first payroll tax under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) to fund the provisions of the Social Security Act presented challenges to employers in Arkansas, and across the country. Early years were marked by large numbers of delinquencies, and guidance from Adkins and staff. The statewide travel and meetings Adkins conducted in his IRS position allowed Adkins to build a strong statewide base of support.
Arkansas&#x27; longtime Senator Joe T. Robinson died on July 14, 1937, creating a large void in state politics and a special election to fill the remaining -years of his term. Adkins was mentioned as a possible entrant into the special election. The key Democratic committee selected governor Carl E. Bailey, who had just recently won the 1936 Arkansas gubernatorial election, in lieu of hosting a Democratic primary, almost assuring Bailey&#x27;s victory in the special election. Allegations were later made against Adkins for ordering his staff to circulate petitions in favor of a state-wide primary (i.e., against appointment of Bailey). Having lost the Democratic nomination fight, a group of anti-Bailey forces tried to convince Adkins to run against Bailey as an independent. Ultimately, John E. Miller, another friend of Robinson&#x27;s, won election as an independent over Bailey.

Adkins also vigorously campaigned for Senator Hattie Caraway over Representative John L. McClellan for the Democratic nomination ahead of the 1938 United States Senate election in Arkansas. McClellan later requested the Treasury Department investigate Adkins&#x27; efforts in the election, but was ultimately cleared by Henry Morgenthau Jr. However, the Senate Special Committee on Campaign Expenditures disagreed with Morgenthau, sustaining many of the charges but ruling &quot;such practices have been common in the past&quot;. Adkins responded, &quot;I am and shall continue to be interested in public affairs. I supported Senator Caraway loyally and wholeheartedly as I did the late Senator Robinson and Senator Miller, and in doing so did no more than has been the custom of loyal friends as long as one can remember.&quot;

In 1939, Adkins&#x27; annual federal salary made news as $6,200 ($ in today&#x27;s dollars). His tax collection duties continued to take him across the state. Adkins continued to lead the remainder of Robinson&#x27;s &quot;federal establishment&quot; faction in state politics, battling Bailey over the WPA in Arkansas, Dyess Colomy, and a refinancing of the state&#x27;s highway debt.

==Governor==
In early 1940, Adkins traveled to Washington D.C. to confer with the Arkansas federal delegation ahead of announcing a bid in the 1940 Arkansas gubernatorial election. Upon returning, Adkins resigned his collectorship to seek the governor&#x27;s office. Loathing the idea of turning the statehouse over to Adkins, Bailey decided to break Arkansas tradition and seek a third term, setting up a direct showdown between the leaders of Arkansas&#x27;s warring Democratic factions in the 1940 Arkansas gubernatorial election.

In the 1940 general election, Adkins defeated the Republican Harley C. Stump, the mayor of Stuttgart and a leader of the Arkansas Municipal League, 91.8 to 8.2 percent. In that campaign Stump claimed the employees of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Works Progress Administration were underpaid. Adkins was unopposed in the 1942 general election for his second term.

Adkins was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, whose support was important in obtaining his first political victory, and its racist views remained a hallmark of his political career.

Adkins sought to build a voting base based on his background as a Methodist Sunday school teacher and church employee. His detractors often referred to him as &quot;Holy Homer.&quot; He campaigned on a platform of reform and ending the practice of bootlegging.

In his first term, Adkins was awarded honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from both John Brown University and Bob Jones University in 1941. Both are private Christian universities known for conservative cultural and religious positions.

The Adkins administration presided over a doubling of the surplus in the state&#x27;s treasury. His administration focused on highway construction and financing, electrification, and worker&#x27;s compensation.

In his second term, Adkins signed into law a bill that would prevent anyone of Japanese descent from owning land in Arkansas. Looking for a new challenge, he was defeated in 1944 in a bid for the U.S. Senate. He opposed Senator Hattie Caraway and the freshman U.S. Representative J. William Fulbright of Fayetteville. Mrs. Caraway finished third, with Fulbright later winning the Democratic runoff against Adkins. Fulbright then claimed the Senate seat when he defeated the Republican Victor Wade of Batesville, 85.1 to 14.9 percent.

In 1948, Adkins was appointed administrator of the Arkansas Employment Security Division, the agency responsible for worker&#x27;s unemployment insurance.

In 1956, he established a public relations firm in Little Rock.

==Death and legacy ==
Adkins died in 1964 in Malvern, Arkansas. He is interred at the Roselawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Little Rock.

<doc id="301171" wikidata="Q924595" url="?curid=301171" title="Char Aznable">
<text>, born and also known as , is a fictional character from the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise. He is originally one of the main antagonists in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; working for the Principality of Zeon, named after his late father Zeon Zum Deikun, with the honorary title of during Gundam&#x27;s One Year War. Despite having opposed Earth Federation soldier Amuro Ray several times, in the sequel &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; he becomes , an Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) pilot fighting alongside the series&#x27; main characters against the elitist Titans. In his final appearance in the Prime-UC in &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, he assumes leadership of the Neo Zeon movement, and becomes the titular antagonist of the film. An alternate Char debuts in &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX&quot;, which sets in an alternate-UC branching timeline, he steals the Gundam and becomes its pilot instead of Amuro, setting the series&#x27; alternate events culminating in Zeon&#x27;s victory of the One Year War, though Char would mysteriously disappear on the final battle.

Char became one of Gundam&#x27;s most iconic characters, often overshadowing Amuro&#x27;s popularity. He also appeared as the most popular male anime character in &quot;Animage&quot;″s Anime Grand Prix poll as well as in several other polls highlighting his popularity in the Gundam franchise. His role in the original has often been praised alongside his rivalry with Amuro.

==Creation==

Char Aznable was based on historic fighter-pilot Manfred von Richthofen who shared a similar nickname, &quot;Red Baron&quot;. As a result, many of Char&#x27;s actions were similar to Richtofen&#x27;s during World War I since Tomino wanted to illustrate the chaos produced by wars in &quot;Gundam&quot;. Amuro was introduced as an ordinary man in contrast to his rival the &quot;Red Comet&quot;. This made Amuro hard to write as he was meant to oppose Char whom Tomino found more interesting. Furuya had fun in his work as during recordings of the series, he befriended Char&#x27;s voice Actor, Shuichi Ikeda. However, he was not close to Tomino. Originally, Tomino did not want to include Amuro in &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; and when trying to kill him, he failed to do it. As a result, he decided to put Amuro on a friendly relationship with Char. Furuya said that while Amuro also had popularity, he could not surpass his rival, Char, a common trait he sometimes find common in anime where there are rivalries. The name &quot;Char Aznable&quot; was inspired by Armenian-French singer and songwriter and a character named Charkin in an earlier robot anime &quot;Reideen&quot; (ライディーン)

==Fictional Biography==
=== &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin&quot; ===
Born Casval Rem Deikun, he is the elder brother of Artesia Som Deikun and son of Zeon Zum Deikun, a dignitary who spoke out for peace between spacenoids and earthlings and founded the Zeon Republic. Following their father&#x27;s supposed heart attack, which was suspected to be an assassination orchestrated by Deikun&#x27;s deputy Degwin Sodo Zabi, young Casval and his sister Artesia escape to Earth with the help of family friend Jimba Ral (father of Ramba Ral). While the Zabi family&#x27;s rise to power, the two Deikun children spend several years living a luxurious life under the guardianship of the aristocratic Don Teabolo Mass, who names them Edward and Sayla, and treats them like his own children. During this time, Jimba Ral constantly reminds Casval of the Zabi Family&#x27;s betrayal of his father. After narrowly escaping another attempt on their lives (in which Jimba Ral dies), they flee to the Texas Colony.

They live for a time in a house set up by Texas Colony&#x27;s chief manager Roger Aznable, still under Teabolo Mass&#x27;s care. They meet Roger&#x27;s son Char Aznable, and discover that he and Casval are nearly identical, except Casval&#x27;s eyes are blue while Char&#x27;s are brown. Eventually Char is taken in by Gihren Zabi&#x27;s propaganda, and against his father&#x27;s wishes sets off for officer training school. Casval decides to accompany him under the guise of looking out for his friend. Kycilia Zabi finds out that Casval is headed back to Side 3, and without consulting Gihren, orders Casval&#x27;s death. Both near-identical boys are booked to leave on the same flight, but an antique pistol and fake explosives are found in Char&#x27;s bag. Not wanting to miss the entrance exam, Char accepts Casval&#x27;s suggestion to swap clothes in the restroom. Char boards the ship under the name Edward Mass, while Casval, under the name Char Aznable is detained overnight. Shortly after departure, the ship explodes and kills everyone aboard, likely due to the work of Kycilia&#x27;s henchmen. &quot;Edward Mass&quot; is listed among the dead and Casval takes on the name Char, enters the Zeon Military Academy and begins wearing sunglasses to hide his eye color (as it wouldn&#x27;t match any of the real Char&#x27;s IDs).

After entering the Academy, Char excels in his training and befriends Garma Zabi. As relations between the Zeon Republic (which has been renamed the Principality of Zeon) and the Federation deteriorate, the Federation increases their troop strength in Side 3. There is widespread fear that this troop increase is in fact an invasion and occupation force. On the eve of troop increase, Casval incites Garma to lead other students in the Academy to storm the Federation base and subdue the stationed troops. For this action Casval is stripped of his rank and expelled from the Academy. He travels to Earth and works at the construction site of Federation headquarters in Jaburo. After hostility breaks out between Zeon and the Federation, he returns to Side 3 and joins the Zeon mobile suit assault forces under the command of Admiral Dozle Zabi. He displays superior fighting abilities during the Battle of Loum, single-handedly destroying five Federation &quot;Magellan&quot;-class battleships by pushing his red-painted Zaku to fly at a breakneck speed, which earned him the nickname &quot;Red Comet&quot;. He was promoted an exceptional two ranks to Lieutenant Commander.

=== &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; ===
On his way back from a mission to clear out guerrilla forces of the Federation Forces, he discovers a new type of ship (the White Base). By tracking it, he obtains information that the Federation Forces are secretly developing mobile suits in Side 7. When his subordinates sent out on a reconnaissance mission are destroyed by the RX-78-2 Gundam, including their Zaku, he sneaks into the colony himself and is reunited with his sister, Artesia (Sayla), who had evacuated to the White Base to serve in the army, and then has his first confrontation with his eventual rival, Amuro Ray. Although Char overwhelms Amuro, who is unfamiliar with combat, from start to finish, he is unable to overcome the Gundam&#x27;s strong armor that can bounce back his attack and its powerful beam rifle.

Later, he is ordered to capture or destroy the White Base and the Gundam, and pursues the White Base as it escapes from Side 7. He launches numerous attacks, including infiltrating the Federation Forces&#x27; space fortress Luna II, where the White Base has escaped, and sabotaging it, but he fails. He loses many of his men and Zaku units. However, during a surprise attack aimed at the White Base&#x27;s entry into the atmosphere, despite the numerous casualty of his squad, he succeeds in bringing it down under Zeon controlled territory, which is under the leadership of Garma.

Unknown to many, Char is secretly plotting revenge against the Zabi family, and utilize the opportunity by luring Garma and his fleet within the firing range of the Federation&#x27;s &quot;White Base&quot;, resulting in his death. Prior to Garma&#x27;s death at the hands of the &quot;White Base&quot;, Char says to him, &quot;Garma, blame this on the misfortune of your birth.&quot; This incurred the wrath of Dozle, and Char was dismissed from the Space Strike Force. He was eventually incorporated into Kycilia Zabi&#x27;s Assault Cavalry. Later in the war, Char begins a bitter rivalry with Federation pilot Amuro Ray, and he develops a relationship with Lalah Sune, a Newtype girl he saved from a brothel. Char also develops into a Newtype himself, and forms psychic bonds with both Amuro and Lalah. Char&#x27;s abilities and natural charisma allow him to inspire and manipulate. Lalah is killed in battle, taking a blow from Amuro meant for Char; this results in a bitter hatred between Char and Amuro.

During the war, Char draws on Zeon&#x27;s philosophy to form his identity. The Zeon Principality is largely an authoritarian state that values independence from the Earth and later the destruction of Earth&#x27;s inhabitants. With his devotion to free all of those who are &quot;trapped by gravity&#x27;s pull&quot; he is able to face the most deadly outcomes with dignity and leadership.

In the Battle of A Baoa Qu, Char and Amuro&#x27;s bitter rivalry reaches the level that they engage in a gunfight and then a sword fight after both lose their mobile suits. In the duel, Char realizes he has been distracted by his rivalry with Amuro, and refocuses on his true enemy – the Zabi family. An ensuing explosion knocks them apart, and Char rushes to save his sister. After being told by a dying Zeon soldier that Kycilia Zabi, the last surviving Zabi, is about to leave, he finds Kycilia&#x27;s departing ship and kills her. He then disappears amidst the explosion and is logically presumed dead.

=== &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam – Char&#x27;s Deleted Affair – A Portrait of a Young Comet&quot; ===
At the end of the One Year War, Char goes to Axis and his experience there is partly depicted in the manga &quot;Char&#x27;s Deleted Affair&quot;, where he heroically protects Axis in two major battles against the Earth Federation. He stays there until the end of U.C. 0082, when he gets back to Side 3 for a special mission to protect Haman Karn&#x27;s inspection journey of Side 3. When they arrive at Zum City in U.C. 0083, he gets an invitation by George Miguel (Brother of Nanai) to join a paramilitary spacenoid organization within the Earth Federation Force.

However, upon hearing of Maharaja Karn&#x27;s fatal illness in late May 0083, Char and Haman both decide to return to Axis. Once they do, they&#x27;re intercepted by the pro-war Axis faction that wishes to restart the conflict with the Earth Federation, led by one Colonel Enzo. A civil war breaks out, with Char and Haman eventually overcoming Enzo&#x27;s forces. Unfortunately, Mahajara Karn – Haman&#x27;s father and the true political leader of Axis&#x27; – dies just shortly before the battle ends, and Haman now finds herself in charge of both Axis and Mineva. Tension between Char and Haman over the future of Axis and Zeon lead Char to finally leave the asteroid permanently with over 600 other soldiers on October 29, 0083.

=== &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; ===
Having left Axis Zeon, Char returns to the Earth Sphere in September U.C. 0084, and infiltrates the Earth Federation Forces ranking with the alias &quot;Quattro Bajeena&quot;. Almost immediately, he finds himself involved in conflicts against the Earth Federation&#x27;s newly formed Titan Task Force, fighting and shooting down two enemy warships within hours of acquiring his new identity. After meeting the Federation politician Commodore Blex Forer, Char joins a group of former Earth Federation Forces soldiers and eventually becomes a leading member of the Anti-Earth Union Group.

This time, rather than serving as the rival of the new protagonist, Kamille Bidan, Char serves as Kamille&#x27;s mentor in the war against the Earth Federation&#x27;s oppressive Titans organization. In Zeta Gundam, Char becomes an ally of his former adversaries in Mobile Suit Gundam: Amuro Ray, Hayato Kobayashi and Bright Noa. He serves under Bright Noa as leader of AEUG mobile suit forces.

During this period, Char loses faith in himself as a decision maker. It seems to be his greatest fear, as he normally displays none in regard to war. When assuming the identity of Quattro he willingly places himself under the command of his former enemies. He has discovered that there can be compromise in the future of Earth&#x27;s population and the colonies. In the course of &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; even Bright Noa, who lost crew to Char&#x27;s attacks on the White Base, urges him to drop the Quattro facade and become a leader to the Spacenoids, or those raised in space colonies. &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; portrays Char&#x27;s image as a hero who is always willing to stand up and fight for the freedom of spacenoids. His political speech in front of Federation Assembly in Dakar, which is broadcast throughout Earth and Space, is one of the most important events in the U.C. Gundam timeline. It seals Char&#x27;s total commitment toward space colonization and migration of humanity to space.

Despite AEUG&#x27;s victory in the Gryps Conflict against the Titans, Char is defeated in the final battle by Haman Karn, leader of the Axis Zeon (later Neo Zeon) faction and assumed dead. However, as the final credits roll, Char&#x27;s damaged mobile suit floats by with its cockpit hatch open.

=== &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; ===
Char returns in the movie &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, set five years later, as the leader of a new Neo Zeon faction. He intends to create a nuclear winter by dropping the massive asteroid base Axis on the Earth, hence forcing a complete migration into space, which he believes will make all of humanity evolve into Newtypes. Only one thing stands in his way: the Federation&#x27;s Londo Bell task force, and their top ace pilot, his old archrival Amuro Ray.

In the second Neo Zeon movement, both Char and Amuro pilot mobile suits equipped with an advanced psycommu system known as psycoframe. Char authorized Anaheim Electronics to pass the psycoframe technology to the development team responsible for Amuro&#x27;s Nu Gundam, effectively planning a fair showdown between them in advance. After Char&#x27;s mobile suit is destroyed by Amuro in the duel, Amuro captures Char&#x27;s escape pod, and against Char&#x27;s taunting, attempts to push the asteroid Axis away from Earth. The intense willpower of Amuro and all the pilots assisting him causes Nu Gundam&#x27;s psycoframes to resonate and overload, resulting in a spectacular aurora with Axis pushed out of Earth&#x27;s orbit. Both Amuro and Char disappear without a trace in the incident. There is no concrete evidence about them being deceased in the movie although Nanai Miguel did claim that Char&#x27;s life force was fading away, as Amuro intercepted Axis and cries for Char when Axis is finally pushed back. The fates of either character were never revealed in the film, though the novelization of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; confirms both as KIA. The follow-up &quot;Gundam Unicorn&quot; also supports this idea. However, in the official Universal Century timeline for the animated series, it lists Amuro Ray and Char Aznable as MIA.
=== &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX&quot; ===
In a branching timeline from the original Mobile Suit Gundam series&#x27; continuity, due to Gene&#x27;s inability to sortie for his mission, Char Aznable participate in the Side-7 Gundam-jack mission, and successfully steals the RX-78-2 Gundam developed by the Earth Federation and becomes its pilot instead of Amuro Ray, renaming it the &quot;Red Gundam&quot; based on his preferences. This event changes the outcome of the One Year War between the Federation and the Principality of Zeon, culminating with Zeon&#x27;s victory. During the final battle, his attempt to prevent the Solomon asteroid being dropped onto Lunar City Granada results in a mythical phenomenon, and his whereabouts is unknown. His mobile suit would later mysteriously reappear 5 years later piloted by the mysterious Shuji Ito, though the latter himself is still missing after the incident.

==Reception==
Char Aznable is not only a character, but has become a brand name. Char, along with five other notable mecha and pilots from the various Gundam series, were recognized in the second set of &quot;Anime Heroes and Heroines&quot; stamps, released in Japan in 2005. Char Aznable has routinely placed in the top 10 lists of popular characters in both Gundam-specific and general-oriented fan magazines in Japan, such as &quot;Gundam Ace&quot; and &quot;Animage&quot;, typically ranking higher than the main character and his rival, Amuro Ray. In &quot;Gundam Ace&quot;, Char is consistently in the top 3 of the list, and held the number 1 spot for long periods of time, despite the fact that &quot;Gundam Ace&quot; tallies votes for Char&#x27;s alter-ego Quattro Bajeena separately. In fact, Quattro also consistently ranks in the top 10. In both Gunpla and Figure magazines it is almost guaranteed to see Char&#x27;s custom red mobile suit. He has also been voted as the second most popular male character from the 1980s by &quot;Newtype&quot; readers. During January from 2007, Oricon made a poll in which they asked Japanese fans from manga and anime which characters from any series they would most like to see in spinoff series. He won the men&#x27;s poll while ranked second in the overall. In a NHK poll from 2018 he was voted as the best &quot;Gundam&quot; character. In an Anime!Anime! poll, Amuro and Quattro were voted as one of the best anime rivals turned into allies. According to Aaron J. Kane from University of Vermont, Tomino managed to create a realistic series by prioritizing on Amuro and Char rather than focus more on the robots like his previous works.

On the Japanese bulletin board 2channel, the Gundam forums are named &quot;Char custom&quot; (シャア専用), and the anonymous placeholder for the name is changed to &quot;3 times more than the usual anonymous&quot; (通常の名無しさんの３倍), a reference to the &quot;3 times faster than the usual Zaku&quot; line from the original series. &quot;Char Custom&quot; refers to Char&#x27;s tendency to highly customized standard Mobile Suits to his exact specifications and generally making the said units far more potent than normal. This usually involves the character coloring his suits red, which led some people to go as far as to label anything red &quot;Char-custom&quot;, and to make vague references to the &quot;3 times more potent&quot; line in the original Gundam series (e.g. A red pencil might write 3 times faster, or is 3 times more likely to break). This pinkish-red colour was actually due to the excess of pinkish red colour ink the animation company had at the time. It is, however, stated in the game &quot;Gireh&#x27;s Greed&quot; that the colour is actually only the colour of an unpainted Zaku due to the grudge from him being the top graduate from military school.

Bandai has capitalized on the character&#x27;s popularity by licensing out the name to various products. There has been a Char-custom laptop, Char-custom GameCube, and a Char-custom motorbike helmet. All these products have a red satin finish, and have the goldleaf Zeon insignia or the emblem of Char&#x27;s Neo Zeon emblazoned on them. A Char-custom Game Boy Advance SP was also created in Japan (with many sources claiming its battery will last 3 times as long as the normal GBA, or even that it will crash 3 times as much). On July 25, 2006, GE Consumer Finance released a Char Custom credit card, which receives three times as many bonus points per 1000 yen spent compared to their other Gundam-related credit cards. Japanese cell phone company Soft Bank released a special Char Custom cell phone in late 2007, with a very large red Zaku head which serves as the charger base. Char related apparel and accessories span a wide range, from the ubiquitous Quattro sunglasses to Char lighters, neckties, wristbands, caps, wallets and a wide range of T-shirts. The creator of Char Aznable, Yoshiyuki Tomino, does not like the idea of making money this way. He feels that by sticking the term &quot;Char&#x27;s Custom&quot; to the products culturally suggests the quality of the product is superior to other brands. However, most of them are only coloured red and are basically the same as the products on which they are based; ironically, some of these &quot;Char Custom&quot; products are even of lower quality than the baseline products. Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino believes that &quot;having satisfaction in such products just because they are popular and can earn money is a sin, since it cannot teach a correct social sense to the newer generation&quot;.

In the 2017 live-action adaptation of Gintama, Char makes a cameo appearance, arriving at Gengai&#x27;s lab and repair shop to pick up his Zaku 2 Commander type, much to the astonishment of manga-obsessed swordsman Gintoki. In this movie, which is packed to the gills with pop culture references, Char is played by actor and singer Seiji Rokkaku.

In a planned spaceflight for 2006, Soyuz TMA-9, a Japanese internet investor named Daisuke Enomoto had asked to dress up as Char Aznable. However, medical restrictions prevented him from participating in the flight. Toyota also formed a new branch called Zeonic Toyota planning to issue a series of special cars, the first one being Char Aznable special Auris.

Although his duel with Amuro in the film was considered the highlight of the film, Allen Divers from Anime News Network criticized how their rivalry was left unfulfilled. THEM Anime Reviews&#x27; Carlo Ross saw Char in the film as the &quot;true star&quot; believing him to overshadow Amuro. On the other hand, J. Doyle Wallis criticized their rivalry in the film considering it a &quot;rehash&quot; of the events of the television series. In &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot;, it is not until Amuro re engineers the with the psycho frame system that he is able to battle Char on equal footing. This handling of Gundams was compared to that of Formula 1 drivers and their own race cars, a connection that still holds for the film. The macro-action of &quot;Char&#x27;s Counterattack&quot; briefly pauses whenever pilots are forced to dock mid-battle in order to attend to repairs and refueling. Such specific attention to the details of the mobile suits in the movie simultaneously be re-created in the model kits that would be released after the film&#x27;s debut.

<text>The Lorenz SZ40, SZ42a and SZ42b were German rotor stream cipher machines used by the German Army during World War II. They were developed by C. Lorenz AG in Berlin. The model name &quot;SZ&quot; was derived from &quot;Schlüssel-Zusatz&quot;, meaning &quot;cipher attachment&quot;. The instruments implemented a Vernam stream cipher.

British cryptanalysts, who referred to encrypted German teleprinter traffic as &quot;Fish&quot;, dubbed the machine and its traffic Tunny (meaning tunafish) and deduced its logical structure three years before they saw such a machine.

The SZ machines were in-line attachments to standard teleprinters. An experimental link using SZ40 machines was started in June 1941. The enhanced SZ42 machines were brought into substantial use from mid-1942 onwards for high-level communications between the German High Command in Wünsdorf close to Berlin, and Army Commands throughout occupied Europe. The more advanced SZ42A came into routine use in February 1943 and the SZ42B in June 1944.

Radioteletype (RTTY) rather than land-line circuits was used for this traffic. These audio frequency shift keying non-Morse (NoMo) messages were picked up by Britain&#x27;s Y-stations at Knockholt in Kent, its outstation at Higher Wincombe in Wiltshire, and at Denmark Hill in south London, and forwarded to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (BP). Some were deciphered using hand methods before the process was partially automated, first with Robinson machines and then with the Colossus computers. The deciphered Lorenz messages made one of the most significant contributions to British &quot;Ultra&quot; military intelligence and to Allied victory in Europe, due to the high-level strategic nature of the information that was gained from Lorenz decrypts.

==History==
After the Second World War, a group of British and US cryptanalysts entered Germany with the front-line troops to capture the documents, technology and personnel of the various German signal intelligence organizations before these secrets could be destroyed, looted, or captured by the Soviets. They were called the Target Intelligence Committee: TICOM.

From captured German cryptographers Drs Huttenhain and Fricke they learnt of the development of the SZ40 and SZ42 a/b. The design was for a machine that could be attached to any teleprinter. The first machine was referred to as the SZ40 (old type) which had ten rotors with fixed cams. It was recognised that the security of this machine was not great. The definitive SZ40 had twelve rotors with movable cams. The rightmost five rotors were called &quot;Spaltencäsar&quot; but named the &quot;Chi&quot; wheels by Bill Tutte. The leftmost five were named &quot;Springcäsar&quot;, &quot;Psi&quot; wheels to Tutte. The middle two &quot;Vorgeleger&quot; rotors were called &quot;Mu&quot; or motor wheels by Tutte.

The five data bits of each ITA2-coded telegraph character were processed first by the five &quot;chi&quot; wheels and then further processed by the five &quot;psi&quot; wheels. The cams on the wheels reversed the value of a bit if in the raised position, but left it unchanged if in the lowered position.

==Vernam cipher==

Gilbert Vernam was an AT&amp;T Bell Labs research engineer who, in 1917, invented a cipher system in which the plaintext bitstream is enciphered by combining it with a random or pseudorandom bitstream (the &quot;keystream&quot;) to generate the ciphertext. This combination is done using the Boolean &quot;exclusive or&quot; (XOR) function, symbolised by ⊕. This is represented by the following &quot;truth table&quot;, where 1 represents &quot;true&quot; and 0 represents &quot;false&quot;.

Other names for this function are: Not equal (NEQ), modulo 2 addition (without &#x27;carry&#x27;) and modulo 2 subtraction (without &#x27;borrow&#x27;).

Vernam&#x27;s cipher is a symmetric-key algorithm, i.e. the same key is used both to encipher plaintext to produce the ciphertext and to decipher ciphertext to yield the original plaintext:

and:

This produces the essential reciprocity that allows the same machine with the same settings to be used for both encryption and decryption.

Vernam&#x27;s idea was to use conventional telegraphy practice with a paper tape of the plaintext combined with a paper tape of the key. Each key tape would have been unique (a one-time tape), but generating and distributing such tapes presented considerable practical difficulties. In the 1920s four men in different countries invented rotor cipher machines to produce a key stream to act instead of a tape. The 1940 Lorenz SZ40/42 was one of these.

==Operating Principle==
The logical functioning of the Tunny system was worked out well before the Bletchley Park cryptanalysts saw one of the machines—which only happened in 1945, as Germany was surrendering to the Allies.
The SZ machine served as an in-line attachment to a standard Lorenz teleprinter. It had a metal base and was high. The teleprinter characters consisted of five data bits (or &quot;impulses&quot;), encoded in the International Telegraphy Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2). The SZ machine generated a stream of pseudorandom characters as the key that was combined with the plaintext input characters to form the ciphertext output characters. The combination was by means of the XOR (or modulo 2 addition) process.

The key stream consisted of two component parts that were XOR-ed together. These were generated by two sets of five wheels which rotated together. The Bletchley Park cryptanalyst Bill Tutte called these the &quot;χ&quot; (&quot;&quot;chi&quot;&quot;) wheels, and the &quot;ψ&quot; (&quot;&quot;psi&quot;&quot;) wheels. Each wheel had a series of cams (or &quot;pins&quot;) around their circumference. These cams could be set in a raised (active) or lowered (inactive) position. In the raised position they generated a &#x27;1&#x27; which reversed the value of a bit, in the lowered position they generated a &#x27;0&#x27; which left the bit unchanged. The number of cams on each wheel equalled the number of impulses needed to cause them to complete a full rotation. These numbers are all co-prime with each other, giving the longest possible time before the pattern repeated. This is the product of the number of positions of the wheels. For the set of &quot;χ&quot; wheels it was 41 × 31 × 29 × 26 × 23 = 22,041,682 and for the &quot;ψ&quot; wheels it was 43 × 47 × 51 × 53 × 59 = 322,303,017. The number of different ways that all twelve wheels could be set was i.e. 16 billion billion.

The set of five &quot;χ&quot; wheels all moved on one position after each character had been enciphered. The five &quot;ψ&quot; wheels, however, advanced intermittently. Their movement was controlled by the two &quot;μ&quot; (&quot;&quot;mu&quot;&quot;) or &quot;motor&quot; wheels in series. The SZ40 &quot;μ&quot;61 motor wheel stepped every time but the &quot;μ&quot;37 motor wheel stepped only if the first motor wheel was a &#x27;1&#x27;. The &quot;ψ&quot; wheels then stepped only if the second motor wheel was a &#x27;1&#x27;. The SZ42A and SZ42B models added additional complexity to this mechanism, known at Bletchley Park as &quot;Limitations&quot;. Two of the four different limitations involved characteristics of the plaintext and so were autoclaves.

The key stream generated by the SZ machines thus had a &quot;χ&quot; component and a &quot;ψ&quot; component. Symbolically, the key that was combined with the plaintext for enciphering and with the ciphertext for deciphering, can be represented as follows.

::::key = &quot;χ&quot;-key ⊕ &quot;ψ&quot;-key

However to indicate that the &quot;ψ&quot; component often did not change from character to character, the term &quot;extended psi&quot; was used, symbolised as: &quot;Ψ&quot;&#x27;. So enciphering can be shown symbolically as:

::::plaintext ⊕ &quot;χ&quot;-stream ⊕ &quot;ψ&quot;&#x27;-stream = ciphertext

and deciphering as:

::::ciphertext ⊕ &quot;χ&quot;-stream ⊕ &quot;ψ&quot;&#x27;-stream = plaintext.

==Operation==

Each &quot;Tunny&quot; link had four SZ machines with a transmitting and a receiving teleprinter at each end. For enciphering and deciphering to work, the transmitting and receiving machines had to be set up identically. There were two components to this; setting the patterns of cams on the wheels and rotating the wheels for the start of enciphering a message. The cam settings were changed less frequently before summer 1944. The &quot;ψ&quot; wheel cams were initially only changed quarterly, but later monthly, the &quot;χ&quot; wheels were changed monthly but the motor wheel patterns were changed daily. From 1 August 1944, all wheel patterns were changed daily.

Initially the wheel settings for a message were sent to the receiving end by means of a 12-letter indicator sent un-enciphered, the letters being associated with wheel positions in a book. In October 1942, this was changed to the use of a book of single-use settings in what was known as the QEP book. The last two digits of the QEP book entry were sent for the receiving operator to look up in his copy of the QEP book and set his machine&#x27;s wheels. Each book contained one hundred or more combinations. Once all the combinations in a QEP book had been used it was replaced by a new one. The message settings should never have been re-used, but on occasion they were, providing a &quot;depth&quot;, which could be utilised by a cryptanalyst.

As was normal telegraphy practice, messages of any length were keyed into a teleprinter with a paper tape perforator. The typical sequence of operations would be that the sending operator would punch up the message, make contact with the receiving operator, use the &quot;EIN / AUS&quot; switch on the SZ machine to connect it into the circuit, and then run the tape through the reader. At the receiving end, the operator would similarly connect his SZ machine into the circuit and the output would be printed up on a continuous sticky tape. Because this was the practice, the plaintext did not contain the characters for &quot;carriage return&quot;, &quot;line feed&quot; or the null (blank tape, 00000) character.

==Cryptanalysis==
British cryptographers at Bletchley Park had deduced the operation of the machine by January 1942 without ever having seen a Lorenz machine, a feat made possible thanks to mistakes made by German operators.

===Interception===
Tunny traffic was known by Y Station operators used to listening to Morse code transmission as &quot;new music&quot;. Its interception was originally concentrated at the Foreign Office Y Station operated by the Metropolitan Police at Denmark Hill in Camberwell, London. But due to lack of resources at this time (around 1941), it was given a low priority. A new Y Station, Knockholt in Kent, was later constructed specifically to intercept Tunny traffic so that the messages could be efficiently recorded and sent to Bletchley Park. The head of Y station, Harold Kenworthy, moved to head up Knockholt. He was later promoted to head the Foreign Office Research and Development Establishment (F.O.R.D.E).

===Code breaking===
On 30 August 1941, a message of some 4,000 characters was transmitted from Athens to Vienna. However, the message was not received correctly at the other end. The receiving operator then sent an uncoded request back to the sender asking for the message to be retransmitted. This let the codebreakers know what was happening.

The sender then retransmitted the message but, critically, did not change the key settings from the original &quot;HQIBPEXEZMUG&quot;. This was a forbidden practice; using a different key for every different message is critical to any stream cipher&#x27;s security. This would not have mattered had the two messages been identical, however the second time the operator made a number of small alterations to the message, such as using abbreviations, making the second message somewhat shorter.

From these two related ciphertexts, known to cryptanalysts as a depth, the veteran cryptanalyst Brigadier John Tiltman in the Research Section teased out the two plaintexts and hence the keystream. But even almost 4,000 characters of key was not enough for the team to figure out how the stream was being generated; it was just too complex and seemingly random.

After three months, the Research Section handed the task to mathematician Bill Tutte. He applied a technique that he had been taught in his cryptographic training, of writing out the key by hand and looking for repetitions. Tutte did this with the original teleprinter 5-bit International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) (which was a development of the Baudot code (ITA1)), which led him to his initial breakthrough of recognising a 41-bit repetition. Over the following two months up to January 1942, Tutte and colleagues worked out the complete logical structure of the cipher machine. This remarkable piece of reverse engineering was later described as &quot;one of the greatest intellectual feats of World War II&quot;.

After this cracking of Tunny, a special team of code breakers was set up under Ralph Tester, most initially transferred from Alan Turing&#x27;s Hut 8. The team became known as the Testery. It performed the bulk of the subsequent work in breaking Tunny messages, but was aided by machines in the complementary section under Max Newman known as the Newmanry.

===Decryption machines===
Several complex machines were built by the British to aid the attack on Tunny. The first was the British Tunny. This machine was designed by Bletchley Park, based on the reverse engineering work done by Tiltman&#x27;s team in the Testery, to emulate the Lorenz Cipher Machine. When the pin wheel settings were found by the Testery, the Tunny machine was set up and run so that the messages could be printed.

A family of machines known as &quot;Robinsons&quot; were built for the Newmanry. These used two paper tapes, along with logic circuitry, to find the settings of the &quot;χ&quot; pin wheels of the Lorenz machine. The Robinsons had major problems keeping the two paper tapes synchronized and were relatively slow, reading only 2,000 characters per second.

The most important machine was the Colossus of which ten were in use by the war&#x27;s end, the first becoming operational in December 1943. Although not fully programmable, they were far more efficient than their predecessors, representing advances in electronic digital computers. The Colossus computers were developed and built by Tommy Flowers, of the Dollis Hill Post Office Research Station, using algorithms developed by Bill Tutte and his team of mathematicians. Colossus proved to be efficient and quick against the twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine.

Some influential figures had doubts about his proposed design for the decryption machine, and Flowers proceeded with the project while partly funding it himself. Like the later ENIAC of 1946, Colossus did not have a stored program, and was programmed through plugboards and jumper cables. It was faster, more reliable and more capable than the Robinsons, so speeding up the process of finding the Lorenz &quot;χ&quot; pin wheel settings. Since Colossus generated the putative keys electronically, it only had to read one tape. It did so with an optical reader which, at 5,000 characters per second, was driven much faster than the Robinsons&#x27; and meant that the tape travelled at almost 30 miles per hour (48 km/h). This, and the clocking of the electronics from the optically read paper tape sprocket holes, completely eliminated the Robinsons&#x27; synchronisation problems. Bletchley Park management, which had been sceptical of Flowers&#x27;s ability to make a workable device, immediately began pressuring him to construct another. After the end of the war, Colossus machines were dismantled on the orders of Winston Churchill, but GCHQ retained two of them.

===Testery executives and Tunny codebreakers===
* Ralph Tester: linguist and head of Testery
* Jerry Roberts: shift-leader, linguist and senior codebreaker
* Peter Ericsson: shift-leader, linguist and senior codebreaker
* Victor Masters: shift-leader
* Denis Oswald: linguist and senior codebreaker

* Peter Benenson: codebreaker
* Peter Edgerley: codebreaker
* John Christie: codebreaker
* John Thompson: codebreaker
* Roy Jenkins: codebreaker
* Shaun Wylie: codebreaker
* Tom Colvill: general manager

By the end of the war, the Testery had grown to nine cryptographers and 24 ATS girls (as the women serving that role were then called), with a total staff of 118, organised in three shifts working round the clock.

==Surviving machines==

Lorenz cipher machines were built in small numbers; today only a handful survive in museums.

In Germany, examples may be seen at the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum, a computer museum in Paderborn, and the Deutsches Museum, a science and technology museum in Munich. Two further Lorenz machines are displayed at both Bletchley Park and The National Museum of Computing in the United Kingdom. Another example is on display at the National Cryptologic Museum in Maryland, the United States.

John Whetter and John Pether, volunteers with The National Museum of Computing, bought a Lorenz teleprinter on eBay for £9.50 that had been retrieved from a garden shed in Southend-on-Sea. It was found to be the World War II military version, was refurbished and in May 2016 installed next to the SZ42 machine in the museum&#x27;s &quot;Tunny&quot; gallery.

<doc id="301174" wikidata="Q365653" url="?curid=301174" title="Carl E. Bailey">
<text>Carl Edward Bailey (October 8, 1894 – October 23, 1948) was an American attorney and the 31st governor of Arkansas from 1937 to 1941.

==Early life==
Bailey was born in Bernie in Stoddard County in southeastern Missouri. He attended public schools and graduated high school in Campbell, Missouri in 1912.

Bailey hoped to attend the University of Missouri in Columbia, but he was unable to secure the financing. In 1915, he attended Chillicothe Business College, where he studied bookkeeping and accounting.

Bailey worked for a time as a railroad brakeman in Texas and later opened a cafe in Campbell. He also served as deputy tax collector in Dunklin County, Missouri.

In 1917, he moved to Weona in Poinsett County, Arkansas, and worked as a cashier in Weona, in nearby Trumann and later in Augusta, Arkansas.

==Legal studies and practice==
Bailey studied law and was admitted to the bar in Arkansas in 1923, and opened a private law practice in 1925. He served as a deputy prosecuting attorney in the Sixth Judicial District of Arkansas from 1927 to 1931.

Bailey became a prosecuting attorney and served in that position from 1931 to 1935. In 1934, he was elected to the post of Arkansas attorney general and served one two-year term. In 1936, mobster Lucky Luciano was arrested in Hot Springs and offered Attorney General Bailey a $50,000 bribe if Bailey would not extradite him to New York. Bailey refused the bribe.

==Political career==
In 1936, Bailey was elected to the first of his two terms as governor. In the general election, Bailey handily defeated the Republican Osro Cobb, who had represented Montgomery County in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1927 to 1930.

Cobb waged an active campaign, having stressed that he was born in Arkansas, whereas the Missouri-born Bailey was a &quot;northern man&quot;. Cobb had proposed the creation of a second national park in the state in the Ouachita National Forest between Little Rock and Shreveport, Louisiana, but the measure was pocket vetoed by U.S. President Calvin Coolidge. Bailey received 156,852 votes (85.4 percent) to Cobb&#x27;s 26,875 ballots (14.6 percent). Cobb recalled that after the election:
many persons called and visited and that they thought a substantial number of votes for me had not been counted. This probably did happen, though to what extent no one can be sure. It also hurt the presidential campaign of my friend, Governor Alf M. Landon of Kansas. This reinforced my conviction that it was absolutely necessary for the rights of the minority party to be protected in elections through the appointment of precinct judges and clerks.

After World War II, an initiated act required Republican representation at all precincts and on counting boards. Without such a measure, it was speculated that Republicans could never have overcome the obstacles they faced in an attempt to establish a two-party system in Arkansas.

Bailey&#x27;s lieutenant governor was also named &quot;Bailey&quot; (Robert B. Bailey). The Bailey administration developed a library and retirement system and established the state&#x27;s first agricultural experiment station at Batesville. During his term, the Department of Public Welfare was founded and Arkansas was made eligible for federal welfare programs. Bailey supported U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs. During Bailey&#x27;s term, the Arkansas State Police was created and the first civil service laws in the American South were enacted.

After U.S. Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson died in office in 1937, Bailey attempted to take the seat himself. He was chosen as the Democratic nominee by the state party convention, which he controlled. However, he had promised when running for governor that he would place such nominations to a vote of the people. Political opponents within the Democratic Party ran an &quot;independent&quot; candidate, who criticized Bailey&#x27;s broken promise. Bailey lost the election by a wide margin to John E. Miller.

By a margin of 91.4 to 8.6 percent, Bailey won his second term as governor in the 1938 general election over the Republican Charles F. Cole of Batesville. In 1940, Bailey sought a third consecutive term as governor but lost to intraparty rival Homer Martin Adkins.

After leaving the governorship, he served as a lobbyist for a railroad union and taught law at the University of Arkansas Law School in Fayetteville. In 1942, he founded the Carl Bailey Company, an International Harvester franchise, which sold innovative farming machinery. Bailey stayed active in politics and continued to wield some influence. In 1944, J. William Fulbright, a congressman from Fayetteville and former president of the University of Arkansas, who had been dismissed by Governor Adkins, opposed Adkins for a U.S. Senate seat. Bailey supported Fulbright, who defeated Adkins and two other opponents and then served until his own defeat in 1974 by fellow Democrat Dale Bumpers.

==Death and legacy==

Bailey died of a heart attack on October 23, 1948, in Little Rock.

The Carl Bailey Company Building on Broadway in Little Rock is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance.

The University of Arkansas maintains a scholarship to the law school in his name.

<doc id="301179" wikidata="Q362625" url="?curid=301179" title="Richard Berry (musician)">
<text>Richard Berry Jr. (April 11, 1935 – January 23, 1997) was an American singer, songwriter and musician, who performed with many Los Angeles doo-wop and close harmony groups in the 1950s, including the Flairs and the Robins.

He is best known as the composer and original performer of the rock standard &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. The song became a hit for the Kingsmen and others, and it is one of the most recorded songs of all time; however, Berry received little financial benefit for writing it until the 1980s, having signed away his rights to the song in 1959. He also wrote and released &quot;Have Love, Will Travel&quot; which has been recorded by many other artists.

==Early life==
Berry was born in Extension, south of Monroe, Louisiana, and moved with his family to Los Angeles as a baby. As a child, he suffered a hip injury and had to walk on crutches until he was six. His first instrument was the ukulele, which he learned when attending a summer camp for crippled children.

Berry attended Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, and with many other pupils practiced singing vocal harmonies in the corridors.

==Musical career==
He began singing and playing in local doo-wop groups, recording with a number of them including the Penguins, the Cadets, the Chimes, the Crowns, the Five Hearts, the Hunters, the Rams, the Whips, and the Dreamers, an otherwise all-female quartet from Fremont High. He then joined the Flairs (who also recorded as the Debonaires and the Flamingoes) in 1953.

===With the Flairs===
The Flairs&#x27; 1953 record &quot;She Wants to Rock&quot; on Modern Records featured Berry&#x27;s bass vocals, and was an early production by Leiber and Stoller. A few months later, when the producers needed a bass voice for the Robins&#x27; &quot;Riot In Cell Block #9&quot; on Spark Records, they recruited Berry to provide the menacing lead vocal on the song – uncredited because he was contracted to Modern. The Robins later split. Three members remained with the Robins and two went to New York with Leiber &amp; Stoller to form the Coasters. The Robins continued to record (with two new members) in California for other labels, including Whippet, Lavender, Arvee, and others.

Berry&#x27;s voice was used at Modern, again uncredited, as the counterpoint to Etta James on her first record and big hit &quot;The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)&quot; and several of its less successful follow-ups. Berry also recorded with several other groups on the Modern and Flair labels, including Arthur Lee Maye and the Crowns, and the Dreamers (who later became the Blossoms). By the end of 1954, Berry left the Flairs to form his own group, the Pharaohs, as well as continued to work with other groups as a singer and songwriter.

===&quot;Louie Louie&quot;===

One of the groups Berry played with after leaving the Flairs was Rick Rillera and the Rhythm Rockers, a Latin and R&amp;B group. In 1955, Berry was inspired to write &quot;Louie Louie&quot;, a calypso-style song, based on the Rhythm Rockers&#x27; version of René Touzet&#x27;s &quot;El Loco Cha Cha&quot;, as well as influenced by Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Havana Moon&quot;. Berry also stated he had Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;One for My Baby&quot; in mind when writing the lyrics. One night while waiting backstage at Anaheim&#x27;s Harmony Park Ballroom, Berry took the rhythm of &quot;El Loco Cha Cha&quot; and began to add lyrics, writing them on toilet paper.

Richard Berry and the Pharaohs recorded and released the song as the B-side to his cover of &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; on Flip Records in 1957. It became a minor regional hit, selling 130,000 copies. It was re-released as an A-side, and when the group toured the Pacific Northwest, several local R&amp;B bands began to adopt the song and established its popularity. &quot;Louie Louie&quot; finally became a major hit when the Kingsmen&#x27;s raucous version – with little trace of its calypso-like origins other than in its lyrics – became a national and international hit in 1963. Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders also recorded the tune in the same studio the week after the Kingsmen, but their version was not a hit. The nearly unintelligible (and innocuous) lyrics were widely misinterpreted as obscene, and the song was banned by radio stations and even investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The song has been recorded over 1,000 times. However, Berry received little financial reward for its success for many years, having sold the copyright for $750 in 1959 to pay for his wedding. Berry said in 1993 &quot;Everybody sold their songs in those days. I never was bitter with the record companies. They provided a vehicle for five young black dudes to make a record.&quot;

Berry continued to write and record into the early 1960s, including &quot;Have Love, Will Travel&quot; (which later became a local hit for the Sonics), but with little commercial success, and also continued as a performer. Other songs included &quot;Crazy Lover&quot;, recorded by the Rollins Band and &quot;Oh! Oh! Get Out of the Car&quot;, covered by the Treniers.

For Rhino&#x27;s 1983 &quot;The Best of Louie, Louie&quot; compilation album, Berry created a note-for-note re-recording of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; because licensing could not be obtained for the original version. Backup vocals were provided by doo wop revival group Big Daddy. The original version was not legitimately re-released until the Ace Records &quot;Love That Louie&quot; compilation in 2002.

===Settlement of rights to &quot;Louie Louie&quot;===
In the mid-1980s, Berry was living on welfare at his mother&#x27;s house in South Central Los Angeles. Drinks company California Cooler wanted to use &quot;Louie Louie&quot; in a commercial, but discovered it needed Berry&#x27;s signature to use the song. The company asked the Artists Rights Society to locate him, and a lawyer visited Berry. The lawyer mentioned the possibility of Berry&#x27;s taking action to gain the rights to his song. The publishers settled out of court, making Berry a millionaire.

===Later years===
In the early 1980s, Berry recorded a duet with his ex-wife Dorothy titled &#x27;The World Needs Peace&#x27;. He re-recorded it a few years later in a gospel version retitled &quot;What We Need&quot;, with his six children providing backup harmony vocals.
During the 1980s, &quot;Louie Louie&quot; received a number of accolades, with hundreds of cover versions issued on CD compilations and played on radio marathons. He continued to play shows and in 1993 played two sets at the 100 Club in London.

==Death==
In February 1996, Berry performed for the final time, reuniting with the Pharaohs and the Dreamers for a benefit concert in Long Beach, California. His health declined shortly afterward, and he died of heart failure in 1997. He was interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

==Musical legacy==
&quot;Louie Louie&quot; is the most recorded rock song of all time, and in 2003 was ranked at No. 54 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

In 2024, the Northeast Louisiana Music Trail placed a commemorative marker in his honor at the Locust Hill Baptist Church in Extension, Louisiana.

==Personal life==
Berry married Dorothy Adams, a girl with whom he attended high school, in 1957, and they had two children, Pam and Marcel. They divorced in 1968. Dorothy pursued a music career, recording for Garpax Records, Challenge Records, Little Star Records and Tangerine. She was a Raelette for Ray Charles until the early 1980s.

Berry had six children in total, Pamela, Richard Marcel, Stephani, Karen, Linda and Christy. Christy, who was born in 1969, handled his career in his later years. Marcel played bass on stage with his father in the 1980s.

<text>The following lists events that happened during [[1941]] in [[Afghanistan]].

Under its enlightened monarch Zahir Shah the country is advancing steadily in education and in the industries which are expected to exercise a civilizing influence on its turbulent people. But endeavours to stir up trouble are not lacking. The ex-emir Amanullah is hanging on to the other side of the frontier and is believed to be under Nazi orders to foment disaffection. The faqir of Ipi, an old campaigner among the tribes, is also intriguing. The king, however, is most correct in his neutrality, and his handling of the German colony in the country in the closing months of the year gives proof of his sincerity. German nationals organized themselves as a foreign branch of the Nazi party, and were developing active pro-Hitler propaganda on the approved fifth-column lines. Their position was one of some strength; they were employed as experts in economic development and in education, as engineers and as suppliers of machinery and plant for industrial enterprises. On British representations, however, the government orders the deportation of all German and Italian nationals; and a considerable danger to British India is thus averted. During the year, Sir Francis Verner Wylie succeeds Sir William Fraser-Tytler as British minister at Kabul.

<text>Cai Yuanpei (; 1868–1940) was a Chinese philosopher and politician who was an influential figure in the history of Chinese modern education. He made contributions to education reform with his own education ideology. He was the president of Peking University, and founder of the Academia Sinica. He was known for his critical evaluation of Chinese culture and synthesis of Chinese and Western thinking, including anarchism. He got involved in the New Culture, May Fourth Movements, and the feminist movement. His works involve aesthetic education, politics, and education reform.

== Biography ==

Born in Shanyin County, Shaoxing, Zhejiang, Cai was appointed to the Hanlin Academy at 26. In 1898, he became involved in administering institutes and became:
* Superintendent of Shaoxing Chinese-Western School (紹興中西學堂監督)
* Head of Sheng District Shanshan College (嵊縣剡山書院院長)
* Director-Teacher of the Special Class (特班總敎習) of Nanyang Public School (predecessor of Shanghai Jiao Tong University)

He established Guangfuhui in 1904 and joined Tongmenghui in Paris the next year, and became a member of the Chinese anarchist group led by Wu Zhihui, and Li Shizeng. He studied philosophy, psychology, and art history in the Universität Leipzig of Germany in 1907 under Karl Lamprecht and Wilhelm Wundt.

He became Minister of Education in the new Republic of China in 1912. As Minister of Education, Cai advocated that film should be used to support public education.

Cai returned to China in 1916 and served as the President of Peking University the following year. There he resumed his support, begun in his Paris years with Li Shizeng, for the Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement, which sent worker-students to France. It was during his tenure at Peking University that he recruited such famous thinkers to the school as future Chinese Communist Party leaders Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao, as well as thinkers like Hu Shih, a close friend, Liang Shuming and the painter Xu Beihong.

In 1919, after the student leaders of the May Fourth demonstrators were jailed, Cai resigned in protest (returning to office in September). Meanwhile, he and Xu Beihong wrote regularly for the &quot;Daily University of Peking University&quot; that dealt with broader issues than just campus politics. Xu addressed issues of Art and Art History and in 1920 a university art journal called &quot;Painting Miscellany&quot; was published. After resigning again in 1922, he spent a period of withdrawal in France. Returning in 1926, he supported his fellow-provincial Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang&#x27;s efforts to unite the country. Along with Wu Zhihui, Li Shizeng, and Zhang Renjie, he was known as one of the &quot;Four Elders&quot; of the Party, and a staunch anti-communist. He was appointed president of the Control Yuan, but soon resigned.

Cai was frustrated in his efforts to remodel the national system of education to resemble the French system, but in 1927, he co-founded the National College of Music, which later became the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and in April 1928, he helped to found and became the first president of the Academia Sinica. He and a wide circle of colleagues founded the China League for Civil Rights which criticized the national government and Chiang Kai-shek for abuse of power. The situation worsened, however; the League could not attain the release from jail of Chen Duxiu, Cai&#x27;s former dean at Peking University, for instance. In June 1933, the Academia Sinica&#x27;s academic administrator and co-founder of the League, Yang Quan, was shot and killed in the street in front of the League&#x27;s Shanghai offices. After a period of shock and reflection, Cai retired from public view in a statement denouncing the political repression of the Nanjing government.

After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, partly because of declining health, instead of accompanying the national government to Sichuan, Cai moved to Hong Kong. He lived there in seclusion until his death in March 1940 at the age of 72.
== Contributions to education ==
Under Cai&#x27;s influence, and with his support for literati and educators in New China, Peking University became important for the development of Chinese education and culture. Cai established the Ministry of Education in 1927, modelled after the French education system.

=== Aesthetic education ===
Cai was an advocator and implementer of Chinese aesthetic education. He promoted the development of Chinese aesthetic education. He had his own unique insights into aesthetics which he associated aesthetics with Chinese traditional virtues. He connected aesthetics with education and politics, which is influenced by his experiences. He emphasized the importance of aesthetics for social stability and development. Besides, he proposed that aesthetics is beneficial to the formation of &quot;public morality and civic virtue&quot;.

=== Women&#x27;s education ===
Cai not only improved women&#x27;s equity in the education system, such as the first women&#x27;s admission in 1920 and mixed-sex education, but he also advocated feminism to change the traditional Chinese concept of women. Cai successively invited several feminists to teach at Peking University, including Chen Duxiu and Hu Shih. They played an important role in Cai&#x27;s reform of women&#x27;s education at Peking University, which was a breakthrough in the history of Chinese education.

== Pedagogy ==

=== Education independence ===
In the journal &quot;New Education&quot; (新教育), Cai proposed that education must be independent of the government. He tried to protect the University Council from direct control by the government.

=== Liberality and democracy ===
Cai raised the traditional virtue of “righteousness (义), reciprocity (恕) and humanity (仁)” based on the Western ideas of &quot;Freedom, equity, fraternity&quot;. He was committed to establishing academic freedom and a pure research atmosphere at Peking University. He also tried to protect the freedom of educators and students, in education reform. Among the teaching staff at Peking University, there were many representatives of the new cultural movement such as Li Dazhao, Hu Shih, and Chen Duxiu. He also assembled notable conservative and old-fashioned scholars such as Gu Hongming and Liu Shipei to teaching at Peking University.

=== Five types of education ===
Cai advocated practising five types of education in the education system. The five types of education refer to military education for citizen (军国民教育), utilitarian education (实利主义教育), civic education (公民道德教育), education for a world view (世界观教育), and aesthetic education (美感学教育).

== Other thought ==

=== Women ===
Cai&#x27;s perspectives on women combined both traditionalism and modernism. He believed in the subordinate, Confucian, relationship between husband and wife, holding that men rule outside the house, and women inside it (男主外女主内). His views on women&#x27;s virtues were also conventional, including, for example, the idea that mothers should be the educators of their children. He held that an unmarried woman was not a virtuous one. Cai Yuanpei was a proponent of women&#x27;s right to divorce and remarry. He strongly opposed foot binding and concubinage, both of which were widely practiced in China at the time. He also advocated education equity as well as physical education for women.

=== Political thoughts ===
He advocated anarchism about anti-oppression to re-establish human civilization. But he emphasized the importance of “a complete state”, which is partly influenced by Western Anarchism&#x27;s views on the state and the family. Cai Yuanpei&#x27;s view on anarchism mainly targets to abolish the colonial oppression China suffered. He studied anarcho-communism and was influenced by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, and Peter Kropotkin.

== May Fourth movement ==
=== New Civil Religion ===
Cai Yuanpei, Chen Duxiu, and Hu Shih put forward their own views on social values and were committed to solving the impact of the Revolution of 1911 on social systems and beliefs during the May Fourth Movement. Cai Yuanpei proposed that the formation of a new civil religion can be achieved by cultivating the Chinese to learn aesthetics, democracy, and science.

=== Linguistics ===
Just as Cai recommended the teaching of the non-state international language Esperanto in China, he also defended the written use of the spoken language (&quot;Pe̍h-ōe-jī&quot;, in which he himself also had written a novel (新年梦) ) to replace the classical Chinese language of the early 20th century. This was one of the main demands of the May 4th Movement (1919).

== Representative works ==

=== &quot;New Year&#x27;s Dream&quot; ===
&quot;New Year&#x27;s Dream&quot; (新年梦) is a short story based on Cai&#x27;s own life, reflecting his ideal society. It is influenced by Liang Qichao’s utopian stories. The writing style is &quot;painful, even violent, and struggle&quot;. The story revolves around the protagonist, a Chinese citizen, telling about China&#x27;s 20th-century revolution. Cai wrote the story while China was suffering from the war with Japan, and was also influenced by the Russo-Japanese War.

<doc id="301214" wikidata="Q1360424" url="?curid=301214" title="Brooklyn Botanic Garden">
<text>Brooklyn Botanic Garden (BBG) is a botanical garden in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City. The botanical garden occupies in central Brooklyn, close to Mount Prospect Park, Prospect Park, and the Brooklyn Museum. Designed by the Olmsted Brothers, BBG holds over 14,000 taxa of plants and has over 800,000 visitors each year. It includes a number of specialty gardens, plant collections, and structures. BBG hosts numerous educational programs, plant-science and conservation, and community horticulture initiatives, in addition to a herbarium collection.

The site of Brooklyn Botanic Garden was first designated in 1897, following three proposals for botanic gardens in Brooklyn in the 19th century. BBG opened in May 1911, on the site of an ash dump, and was initially operated by the Brooklyn Institute. Most of BBG&#x27;s expansions were carried out over the next three decades under the tenure of its first director, C. Stuart Gager. BBG began operating three additional sites in the New York metropolitan area in the 1950s and 1960s, while its main garden in Brooklyn fell into decline. The original Brooklyn Botanic Garden was expanded and restored substantially starting in the 1980s, and additional structures were built through the 2010s.

BBG&#x27;s landscape includes many specialty gardens and a group of buildings on its eastern boundary, accessed from three entrances. A brook flows from the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden in the north to the Water Garden in the south. BBG&#x27;s other specialty gardens include rose, native flora, Shakespeare, fragrance, and children&#x27;s gardens. There are also more formal landscape features such as an overlook, a celebrity path, the Osborne Garden, and a cherry esplanade. The structures include the 1980s-era Steinhardt Conservatory, the Laboratory Administration Building (which contains a library), and a palm house dating from the 1910s.

==History==

=== Early proposals ===
Prior to the construction of the present Brooklyn Botanic Garden, there had been three proposals for botanic gardens in the then-independent city of Brooklyn in the 19th century, though only one of these botanic gardens was ever built. André Parmentier had created the Horticultural and Botanic Garden of Brooklyn in October 1825 within Prospect Heights, on a plot bounded by Sixth, Atlantic, and Carleton Avenues and Bergen Street; this garden only lasted until about 1830. Brooklyn resident Thomas Hunt granted $50,000 in 1855 for the establishment of a botanic garden in Sunset Park (between Fifth Avenue, 57th Street, Sixth Avenue, and 60th Street). The Hunt Horticultural and Botanical Garden sought to raise $150,000, but the garden was never built at that location.

The third plan for a botanical garden in Brooklyn was included in the plans for Prospect Park, which was approved in 1859. In February 1860, a group of fifteen commissioners submitted suggestions for park locations in Brooklyn, including a plot centered on present-day Mount Prospect Park and bounded by Warren Street to the north; Vanderbilt, Ninth, and Tenth Avenues to the west; Third and Ninth Streets to the south; and Washington Avenue to the east. Egbert Viele began drawing plans for the park, which was to straddle Flatbush Avenue and include Prospect Hill and the land now occupied by the Brooklyn Public Library, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the Brooklyn Museum. The botanical garden was initially planned to be located along the shores of the park&#x27;s lake. The onset of the Civil War stopped further activity; following the war, the triangle of land to the east of Flatbush Avenue was excluded from the park. The botanical garden within Prospect Park was not built. The northeast portion of the triangle served as an ash dump until just before Brooklyn Botanic Garden was established.

=== Creation ===

==== Legislation and funding ====
On May 18, 1897, as the city moved toward consolidation, the New York State Legislature reserved 39 acres (16 ha) for a botanic garden. The site became part of Institute Park in 1902. The garden was to be run under the auspices of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, which until the 1970s included Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Children&#x27;s Museum, and Brooklyn Academy of Music. By 1901, the institute sought to acquire a site on the eastern side of Flatbush Avenue for the botanical garden. This site had also been proposed as the location of a proposed Brooklyn university, but the institute wanted to establish a botanical garden on the site. Several of the institute&#x27;s donors proposed in 1905 to give $25,000 for the upkeep of a &quot;scientific botanic garden&quot; next to the Brooklyn Museum. The next year, the donors doubled this award to $50,000. City officials endorsed the creation of the botanical garden in 1907, and supporters of the institute donated thousands of dollars toward the botanical garden. Alfred Tredway White, a trustee of the Brooklyn Institute, leased a site behind the Brooklyn Museum from the city.

Although the New York City Board of Estimate approved Brooklyn Botanic Garden&#x27;s creation in June 1909, it did not approve another agreement that would allow the Brooklyn Institute to maintain the botanical garden. By the end of that year, the Olmsted Brothers had been hired as landscape designers, while McKim, Mead &amp; White had been hired as architects for the botanical garden&#x27;s buildings. The Board of Estimate voted on December 10, 1909, to allow the city and the Brooklyn Institute to sign a maintenance agreement for the botanical garden. New York City government and the Brooklyn Institute signed the maintenance agreement on December 28, and an endowment fund for BBG was created three days later. C. Stuart Gager was hired as BBG&#x27;s first director in March 1910. At this point, BBG was authorized to spend between $2,000 and $2,500 annually on plantings. That June, the city government appropriated $25,000 for Brooklyn Botanic Garden&#x27;s plant houses.

==== Construction and opening ====

Gager wanted to create &quot;an animated textbook in botany&quot;, with a Palm House and laboratories facing Washington Avenue, as well as a landscape with valleys, hills, a pond, and rocks. In contrast to older botanical gardens, Brooklyn Botanic Garden was not arranged based solely on taxonomic classifications; the Olmsted Brothers sought to make the garden aesthetically pleasing as well. McKim, Mead &amp; White began drawing up plans in late 1910 for a laboratory and administration building with a 480-seat lecture hall, laboratories, and classrooms. The New York City government turned over to the Brooklyn Institute in February 1911, and the institute&#x27;s director Franklin W. Hooper requested the same month that more land be allocated to BBG. McKim, Mead &amp; White had completed plans for two wings of the Palm House and the first part of the Laboratory Administration Building that March. The next month, the institute decided to build only one part of the Palm House, as the botanical garden only had a $50,000 budget.

The first section of BBG, the Native Flora Garden, opened on May 13, 1911; the date was chosen to coincide with the birthday of the naturalist Carl Linnaeus. At the time, the plants had temporary labels, and work on the Palm House and laboratory had not started. By late 1911, the Brooklyn Institute was planting shrubs and trees and were curating BBG&#x27;s lawn. The plantings included between 150 and 200 species of shrubs that grew within of Brooklyn. BBG staff used a temporary headquarters in the Brooklyn Museum while BBG was being completed. Harold Caparn was appointed as the landscape architect in 1912, serving in that position until 1945. BBG hired Cockerill &amp; Little Co. to build the Laboratory Administration Building in January 1912 and began constructing the structure three months later. That September, the city government gave BBG an additional of land, abutting the museum and reservoir.

Workers began constructing the second section of the Palm House and landscaping the northern section of the botanical garden in early 1913. The completion of the Laboratory Administration Building was postponed because of difficulties in obtaining roof tiles and structural steel. The first portions of the Laboratory Administration Building and the Palm House were being completed by mid-1913, and these structures opened in December 1913. At the time, the Palm House had about 250 specimens from 140 species. Dirt from the Brooklyn Botanical Garden was used to flatten land in Prospect Park, and workers also landscaped BBG&#x27;s watercourses and laid out paths. The ongoing work forced officials to close off about two-thirds of the botanical garden&#x27;s area to the public. BBG launched a children&#x27;s garden in 1914, which was one of the first of its kind in the world. By the end of that year, workers were constructing a Japanese garden and a rock garden.

BBG&#x27;s Japanese garden opened on the northeastern corner of the grounds in June 1915, next to the lake. At that time, BBG started admitting visitors every day of the week; the grounds had been closed during the previous year because workers were regrading the paths. McKim, Mead &amp; White filed plans for expansions of the Palm House and the Laboratory Administration Building in August 1915 at a projected cost of $150,000. The Board of Estimate approved the rock garden in March 1916, and the Laboratory Administration Building&#x27;s cornerstone was laid at a groundbreaking ceremony that April. The rock garden was completed in May 1916. The same year, the third section of the Palm House was built, and contracts for the Palm House&#x27;s fourth section were awarded. The Laboratory Administration Building and Palm House were nearly complete in early 1917 and were dedicated on April 19–21, 1917. The children&#x27;s building was finished the same year.

=== Operation ===
Caparn designed most of BBG&#x27;s grounds in the botanical garden&#x27;s first three decades of operation, including the Osborne Garden, Cranford Rose Garden, Magnolia Plaza, and Plant Collection. For most of the 20th century, BBG could not expand beyond because of space constraints. BBG initially did not charge admission.

==== 1920s and 1930s ====
By the early 1920s, BBG had 330,000 visitors a year, including over 15,000 students from across Brooklyn. During 1921, BBG staff planted 2,000 lily bulbs within its Lily Pool Terrace, as well as thousands of daffodils and crocus bulbs. BBG also planted thousands of asters east of the Laboratory Administration Building. Daniel Chester French designed the Alfred Tredway White Memorial for the botanical garden in 1922 following White&#x27;s death. John D. Rockefeller Jr. offered to donate $250,000 to BBG in 1925 on the condition that the botanical garden raise matching funds. By then, 500,000 people (including 50,000 students) visited BBG annually, and BBG gave lectures and classes to another 25,000 people per year. The same year, Ernest F. Coe donated 32 bonsai to allow BBG to establish its Bonsai Collection, and Henry C. Folger gave BBG $500 to establish a Shakespeare garden, which opened in May 1925. Gager announced in 1927 that BBG would create a rose garden, following a $10,000 donation from Walter V. Cranford (later increased to $15,000). The rose garden opened on May 8, 1928, and was finished that June. An anonymous donor contributed funds for a stone bridge at BBG in December 1928, replacing a wooden bridge across the botanical garden&#x27;s lake.

Gager announced in June 1929 that an ornamental gate designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White would be installed at BBG&#x27;s Flatbush Avenue entrance, following a donation from Richard Young. The next month, BBG trustee Alfred W. Jenkins donated funds for two additional stone &quot;rustic bridges&quot;. By that October, the gate and several new bridges within BBG were nearly finished; the gate was dedicated in May 1930. During the same time, ten garden seats and eight drinking fountains were donated to BBG, and Jenkins agreed to donate a fountain and another rustic bridge in 1930, BBG awarded contracts for the construction of a plaza in front of the Laboratory Administration Building in April 1930, more than a decade after plans for the plaza had been drawn up. Gager also planned to build three other gates, an overlook, a north addition next to the Brooklyn Museum, garden seats, and plantings within the Native Flora Garden. The Japanese garden was expanded as well, reopening in 1931.

In 1933, a redesigned native wildflower garden, the Laboratory Administration Building plaza, and the overlook were completed, and the BBG Women&#x27;s Auxiliary donated magnolias to the garden&#x27;s Magnolia Plaza. Civil Works Administration (CWA) workers began landscaping the north addition next to the Brooklyn Museum the same year. The CWA crew also constructed a new entrance to BBG from Eastern Parkway. Most of the north addition was completed in 1935, when BBG had 1.35 million annual visitors. Afterward, BBG staff planted a formal garden along the north addition; a &quot;wall garden&quot; next to Mount Prospect Park; and an herb garden. Mrs. Walter V. Cranford donated a Rose Arc Pool to BBG in 1936. BBG&#x27;s Japanese shrine burned down in January 1938; the herb garden at the northeast corner of BBG, planted by the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary, was dedicated that September. Sade Elisabeth Osborne dedicated the Dean Clay Osborne memorial at BBG in April 1939.

==== 1940s and 1950s ====
BBG attracted about 1.8 million annual visitors at the beginning of the 1940s with an endowment fund of nearly $1.4 million. The Cherry Esplanade was created in 1941 after the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary donated four rows of cherry trees. An ivy garden was also dedicated the same year. The Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden was closed from 1941 to 1947 because of anti-Japanese sentiment during World War II. BBG rehired McKim, Mead &amp; White in 1942 to design a $200,000 annex to the Laboratory Administration Building, but the annex was not completed because of financial shortfalls. Gager, BBG&#x27;s first director, died in 1943 and was succeeded by George S. Avery Jr. the following year. Michael Tuch and his wife donated a wrought iron gate for BBG&#x27;s Eastern Parkway entrance in 1945, and the gate was dedicated in March 1946.

By the early 1950s, Avery planned to expand BBG&#x27;s children&#x27;s garden by by covering the open-cut Franklin Avenue subway line. At the time, the children&#x27;s garden only had space for 250 plots, but a thousand children wanted to use the children&#x27;s garden each year. BBG accommodated 1.35 million visitors annually, more than the larger New York Botanical Garden did, but received less funding from the city. The Women&#x27;s Auxiliary proposed creating a &quot;garden of fragrance&quot; at BBG in May 1954; the project was inspired by a British garden for the blind. Construction of the garden, located just north of the Laboratory Administration Building, began in October 1954. The fragrance garden was dedicated in June 1955.

Elizabeth Van Brunt sold of forest at Kitchawan in Westchester County, New York, to BBG in 1956 for use as a research center. BBG planned to move its nursery to Westchester to make way for a expansion of the children&#x27;s garden. Workers restored BBG&#x27;s paths, and added new trees and benches, in 1958 as part of a project designed by Clarence C. Combs. Local women also volunteered to cultivate the garden after BBG staff went on strike for several months in 1959.

==== 1960s and 1970s ====
A Shinto shrine was dedicated at BBG&#x27;s Japanese Garden in May 1960, replacing a shrine that vandals had burned down. The research center in Westchester was dedicated the same month. By that October, BBG had recorded 50 million all-time visitors. Takuma Paul Tono designed a replica of a stone garden at Ryōan-ji after BBG received a private donation in 1961. The stone garden, dedicated in May 1963, contained 15 granite stones of varying colors and sizes. The Native Flora Garden was closed in 1963 due to a lack of funding; it did not reopen for two decades. By the mid-1960s, Avery said BBG&#x27;s finances were in decline, as most of the garden&#x27;s funding came from wealthy benefactors who were moving away from Brooklyn. Furthermore, an increase in crime had caused BBG officials to close off most of the botanical garden&#x27;s exits by the end of the decade, and litter was beginning to accumulate in the surrounding area. BBG had an average of 5,000 daily visitors by the late 1960s.

Avery served as BBG&#x27;s director until 1969, and Louis B. Martin briefly served as BBG&#x27;s third director for the next two years, until the beginning of 1972. As early as 1971, the city considered allowing the Brooklyn Botanic Garden to charge admission. Elizabeth Scholtz, BBG&#x27;s assistant curator of instruction, was appointed as the garden&#x27;s acting director in 1972 and officially became the garden&#x27;s fourth director the next year, making her the first woman to lead a large U.S. botanical garden. Under Scholtz&#x27;s leadership, BBG shifted its focus to its three &quot;outreach stations&quot; in Westchester County and on Long Island, as there was very little space to expand the original garden in Brooklyn. Although public interest in BBG had grown, the original garden in Brooklyn only employed seven full-time instructors and some part-time instructors. The Ryōan-ji stone garden, which had been closed for several years because of a lack of funds, reopened in 1973.

BBG split from the Brooklyn Institute during the 1970s. The Women&#x27;s Auxiliary of BBG launched a docent program, Volunteer Garden Guide, in 1974. Continuing financial problems forced BBG to close on Mondays starting in 1975 for the first time in its history. The change was attributed to the fact that BBG&#x27;s annual operating budget had come to exceed $2 million, a two-thirds increase from the $1.2 million budget in 1970, but the city had committed to funding a smaller portion of BBG&#x27;s expenses. BBG had 800,000 annual visitors by the late 1970s; although this was half the number of visitors that the garden had recorded in the mid-20th century, BBG was still more popular than comparable botanical gardens. The Shakespeare Garden reopened in June 1979 after being relocated from its original location near the Children&#x27;s Garden.

==== 1980s and 1990s ====
Donald E. Moore became BBG&#x27;s fifth leader in 1980. Under his tenure, BBG was expanded, and its membership grew threefold to 25,000. BBG began allowing events, such as parties and weddings, on its grounds in 1982; it also started hosting an annual cherry blossom festival that year. In 1983, BBG reopened its native flora garden, which had been closed for twenty years, after hiring a gardener and two assistants. By the mid-1980s, the botanical garden had over 600,000 annual visitors, as well as 11,000 members from around the world. BBG also had 15,000 specimens representing 2,000 species. At that time, BBG&#x27;s Palm House and the adjacent wooden greenhouses had become severely deteriorated. The Celebrity Path was created in 1985 following a donation from the Brooklyn Union Gas Company.

BBG announced in 1984 that it would construct a new conservatory and restore the Palm House for $16 million. The city and BBG would each pay for half of the renovation. The conservatory was to be designed by Davis, Brody &amp; Associates, who were also responsible for renovating the Palm House and Administration Building. Work on the new conservatory commenced in May 1984; it was the first major building erected in BBG since the 1910s. The conservatory replaced three smaller gardens, including the Ryōan-ji stone garden. The conservatory&#x27;s $25 million cost included $3 million from Michael and Judith Steinhardt and $11.65 million from the city government. The Steinhardt Conservatory was named for the couple in March 1988 and opened on May 19, 1988. BBG also renovated the Palm House into an education center and event space, and it erected an education building with greenhouses, displays, and classrooms. The renovation added , more than doubling the amount of space dedicated to displaying plants and exhibits. A gift shop opened next to the Steinhardt Conservatory in June 1989, and a discovery center sponsored by Chase Manhattan Bank opened in September 1989.

Judith Zuk was named as BBG&#x27;s president in 1990 after Moore resigned. Several of BBG&#x27;s gardens were renovated under Zuk&#x27;s tenure. The Discovery Garden opened next to the Discovery Center in September 1992, and the viewing pavilion in the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden was renovated in 1993 as part of a larger $1.5 million rehabilitation of the Japanese garden. In 1996, the garden began charging admission of $3 per adult after cuts in public and private funding and increases in operating costs. Community groups objected that the admission fee would negatively impact local residents, but Zuk said the fee would raise at least half a million dollars per year. To attract visitors during the winter, BBG began hosting model train displays in late 1998. The Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden was renovated starting in 1999; the project was supposed to cost $3 million and was funded mostly by the New York City Council. The project included repainting the torii, restoring the viewing pavilion and Turtle Island, making the lower level accessible, and planting extra trees. The Japanese garden reopened in May 2000.

==== 2000s to present ====

When the entrance to the Brooklyn Museum was rebuilt in 2002, some of BBG&#x27;s cherry trees had to be cut down. The entrance on Eastern Parkway was rebuilt in 2003 at a cost of $2.5 million. The previous entrance had been too narrow and was set back from the street, making it difficult for visitors to see the entrance. The new entrance opened in 2005. After Zuk retired in 2005, the Magnolia Plaza was named in her honor, and Scot Medbury was selected as president the same year. Medbury planned to build a party room, restaurant, and visitor center; by then, BBG had 700,000 annual visitors and an operating budget of nearly $15 million. The Cranford Rose Garden was restored in 2006, followed by the C.V. Starr Bonsai Museum the next year.

BBG&#x27;s Laboratory Building was designated as a city landmark in 2007. The same year, as part of the Campaign for the Next Century, BBG started to raise money for new gardens, entrances, and a visitor center. Major donors to the campaign included Charlie and Irene Hamm, the Leon Levy Foundation, the Brooklyn Community Foundation, and the Robert Wilson Charitable Trust. BBG announced in 2009 that it would build a new entrance and visitor center on its northeastern corner, at the intersection of President Street and Washington Avenue. The botanical garden also planned to construct herb, woodland, and water gardens for its centennial. The visitor center was originally supposed to be located near the Cherry Walk but was moved to provide a better connection with the surrounding area. BBG relocated its herb garden in 2010, and the visitor center opened in May 2012. In June 2013, BBG opened an expansion of its Native Flora Garden. BBG suspended its science program that year because of budget cuts and the severe deterioration of BBG&#x27;s science center in Crown Heights.

Brooklyn Botanic Garden was one of ten institutions that received the National Medal for Museum and Library Service in 2014, the centennial of its children&#x27;s garden. BBG&#x27;s Discovery Garden reopened in June 2015 after a renovation designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh. The Water Garden, which was named for Shelby White and Leon Levy after they donated $7.5 million to BBG, reopened in September 2016 following a restoration. The Yellow Magnolia Café opened within the Palm House in 2017. In 2018, BBG announced that it would re-landscape a hill leading to the Robert W. Wilson Overlook, which was rededicated in November 2019. The Elizabeth Scholtz Woodland Garden, named in honor of BBG&#x27;s former director, also opened the same year. After a high-rise tower development was announced next to BBG at 960 Franklin Avenue, BBG protested the project in 2019; the towers were canceled after city officials rejected the project.

BBG was closed temporarily from March to August 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Former city parks commissioner Adrian Benepe was selected as BBG&#x27;s eighth president in late 2020, after Medbury resigned. The retailer Anthropologie opened a Terrain home-and-garden store at BBG in 2024. A 14-story apartment building east of BBG was again proposed in the 2020s, amid an affordable-housing shortage in the neighborhood. The building&#x27;s developer Bruce Eichner threatened to cancel the project following opposition from BBG and local residents, but he then proposed a modified plan following negotiations with BBG and city officials.

== Location and geography ==
Brooklyn Botanic Garden is in the central part of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, on the border of the Park Slope, Prospect Heights, and Crown Heights neighborhoods. It occupies much of the city block bounded by Eastern Parkway to the north, Washington Avenue to the east, Empire Boulevard to the south, and Flatbush Avenue to the southwest. BBG shares a large city block with Brooklyn&#x27;s Central Library, Mount Prospect Park, and the Brooklyn Museum to the west and north. The far southeastern corner of the block contains the Brooklyn Central Office, Bureau of Fire Communications, at 35 Empire Boulevard. BBG covers , making it much smaller than the New York Botanical Garden, which covers . , BBG has over 14,000 plant species.

Approximately 17,000 years ago the terminal moraine of the receding Wisconsin Glacier that formed Long Island, known as the Harbor Hill Moraine, established a string of hills and kettles as well as a lower lying outwash plain. Mount Prospect (or Prospect Hill), near the intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Eastern Parkway, is one of the tallest hills in Brooklyn, rising 200 feet (61 m) above sea level. As a result of the Wisconsin glaciation, there were a large number of rock outcroppings on the site prior to BBG&#x27;s development. The northwestern and eastern edges of the site contained outcroppings, while the rest of the site was in an overwash plain. Boulders from the site were used in the rock garden, the native flora garden, bridges and dams across the artificial brook, and pedestals for various memorial tablets. In addition to 18 boulders in the rock garden, there are six outcroppings in other parts of BBG.

A brook runs across the garden from the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden in the north to the Shelby White and Leon Levy Water Garden in the south. Water from the Water Garden flowed into a storm drain prior to 2019, when the Water Conservation Project was completed. As a result of the project, water from the Water Garden is recirculated to the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden. This project was intended to save over of water per year, reducing by 95 percent the amount of water that the brook drew from the New York City water supply system.

=== Entrances ===

Brooklyn Botanic Garden contains three entrances. The southwest entrance, at Flatbush Avenue near Empire Boulevard, is near the New York City Subway&#x27;s Prospect Park station. McKim, Mead &amp; White designed an Italian Renaissance Revival-style gate at Flatbush Avenue. The gate measures tall by wide and is made of brick and limestone. It contains three arches measuring deep, with a large central arch flanked by smaller entry and exit arches. Three similar arches were proposed, one on Eastern Parkway and two on Washington Avenue, but were not built. In the early 21st century, a visitor center was added next to the Flatbush Avenue entrance.

The northern entrance on Eastern Parkway is adjacent to an entrance to the New York City Subway&#x27;s Eastern Parkway–Brooklyn Museum station. Prior to 2003, it contained a decorative metal gate dating from 1946. The gate contained plaques symbolizing three major crops, namely rice, maize, and wheat. In addition, there were vertical reliefs that symbolize plant evolution. The entrance was rebuilt in 2003 with a stainless-steel gate flanked by curved steel walls. The new entrance, designed by James Polshek, also contains a cast-glass cone, as well as an embankment with information and ticket kiosks. Just within the entrance, there are boulders from New Jersey on either side of the path, as well as an overhanging birch branch.
The eastern entrance on Washington Avenue abuts the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s parking lot. This entrance contains the Diane H. and Joseph S. Steinberg Visitor Center, designed by Weiss/Manfredi, and faces the botanical garden&#x27;s northeastern corner. The structure is accessed by a set of stairs, which lead to a concrete plaza with a rock garden on its northern border (abutting the Brooklyn Museum&#x27;s parking lot). The visitor center&#x27;s Washington Avenue facade is made of concrete and glass, with a gabled copper roof, while the northern and southern facades of the visitor center are curved. The interior consists of a rectangular pavilion to the east, which houses the gift shop, and a curving pavilion to the west, with kitchens, event spaces, offices, and exhibits. The visitor center has a sloped green roof, covering . The structure is heated by a ground source heat pump system.

==Specialty gardens and collections==
=== Osborne Garden ===

At the extreme north end of BBG, just south of the Eastern Parkway entrance, is the Osborne Garden, a Italian-style garden that features pergolas. The Osborne Garden also contains a memorial with four columns, a fountain, sinks, and seats. The columns are arranged in two pairs, one each at the northern and southern end. Each set of columns is fluted and is high, with ginkgo leaves inscribed into the pedestals of each column. There is a stone flower bed between the northern and southern pairs of columns, which originally served as a reflecting pool. The fountain is located near the southern pair of columns and is surrounded by limestone benches, which are arranged in a semicircle. The benches are nicknamed the &quot;whispering chairs&quot; because people sitting on the benches at either end can hear each other clearly even when whispering. A staircase at the south end of the Osborne Garden descends to the Louisa Clark Spencer Lilac Collection.

===Native Flora Garden===
The Native Flora Garden, formerly the Local Flora Section, is located at BBG&#x27;s northwestern corner, just southwest of the Osborne Garden. It was the first of its kind in North America. It was originally a wildflower planting but was redesigned in 1931 as a woodland habitat with plants native to the New York metropolitan area. The 1931 redesign divided the Native Flora Garden into eight sections, each corresponding to a different &quot;ecological zone&quot;. The Native Flora Garden was closed from 1963 to 1983 due to a lack of funding.

Until the 2000s, the Native Flora Garden&#x27;s ecological zones consisted of a serpentine rock formation, a kettle pond with dry meadow, a bog, a limestone ledge, a pine barrens, a wet meadow, and a deciduous woodland. The garden was expanded in the late 2000s and early 2010s to provide space for local plants that were shaded out by the original garden&#x27;s mature canopy. The current design, by Darrel Morrison, dates to 2013. The expansion has a tallgrass prairie, dry meadow, pine barrens, kettle pond, and a wooden bridge. There are over 15,000 specimens within the older Native Flora Garden and the expansion.

===Cranford Rose Garden===
The Cranford Rose Garden is in the northern section of BBG, between the Cherry Esplanade to the east and the Native Flora Garden to the west. It is named after Walter V. Cranford, a construction engineer whose firm built many of Brooklyn&#x27;s subway tunnels, and who had donated $15,000 to BBG for a rose garden. The Cranford Rose Garden was designed by landscape architect Harold Caparn and BBG horticulturist Montague Free. The garden originally measured across and contained 15 beds with 3,000 total roses, each bed being surrounded by wooden trellis panels. The varieties of roses were originally arranged in chronological order, with older varieties to the north and newer varieties to the south. There was also a pavilion and a pergola, as well as a triangle south of the pavilion with space for historical roses.

During the late 20th century, it was the United States&#x27; third-largest rose garden that was open to the public. At the time, the Cranford Rose Garden had 5,000 bushes, representing 900 varieties. Many of the original plants were still in the garden in the early 21st century. A 2001 guidebook cited the Cranford Rose Garden as having 1,200 varieties of roses. The garden features many varieties of roses including the Knock Out rose, the Julia Child rose, and the Yellow Rose of Texas. In addition, there are numerous All-America Rose Selections, as well as roses honoring celebrities such as actors Angela Lansbury and George Burns.

=== Cherry Walk and Cherry Esplanade ===
Brooklyn Botanic Garden has more than 200 cherry trees, representing 42 Asian species and cultivated varieties, across its Cherry Walk and Cherry Esplanade. Depending on weather conditions, the Asian flowering cherries bloom from late March or early April to mid-May, though the many species flower at slightly different times. The original cherry trees date to 1921 when BBG planted 30 trees on the Cherry Walk. The Cherry Walk connects the pond with the Cherry Esplanade in the north-central portion of BBG.

The Cherry Esplanade features two rows of tall cherry trees, as well as several rows of shorter cherry trees. There are 76 trees on the Cherry Esplanade, which represent 21 varieties. There is a -high limestone fountain in the Cherry Esplanade, which consists of a circular limestone bowl above a concrete water basin. The southern end of the esplanade contains the Rose Arc Pool, consisting of three beds of roses arranged in a semicircle.

===Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden===

BBG&#x27;s Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden is at the northeast corner, east of the Cherry Esplanade. It was one of the first Japanese gardens to be created in an American botanic garden, and reportedly the first one to be accessible free of charge. It was constructed for $13,000, a gift of early BBG benefactor and trustee Alfred Tredway White. The garden was created by Japanese landscape designer Takeo Shiota. Shiota never fully documented his design before his death in 1943, and various renovations over the years have modified Shiota&#x27;s original plans for the Japanese Garden.

The garden contains three man-made hills signifying earth, heaven, and humanity; an artificial waterfall and island, and rocks. The garden also contains a curved pond; although it is commonly cited as being shaped after the Chinese character for &quot;heart&quot;, the pond predates BBG. Among the architectural elements of the garden are wooden bridges, stone lanterns, a viewing pavilion, a &quot;torii&quot; (gateway), and a Shinto shrine. The pond is filled with hundreds of Japanese koi fish that visitors can view at the torii or along the garden&#x27;s trail. The center of the pond contains Turtle Island, a small rock that contains a granite lantern. There is also a Japanese temple dedicated to Inari, the fox kami. A shogun lantern, installed in 1980, celebrates the fact that Tokyo is a sister city of New York City. The brook from this garden leads through several other parts of Brooklyn Botanic Garden, terminating at the Water Garden.

The shrine and viewing pavilion were both rebuilt in the 1960s after burning down. The Japanese Garden was renamed the Oriental Garden during World War II and restored in 1950 following an extended wartime closure. The Japanese Garden&#x27;s 2000 restoration, costing $3 million, was recognized with the New York Landmark Conservancy&#x27;s 2001 Preservation Award.

===Shakespeare Garden===

BBG&#x27;s original Shakespeare Garden was funded by a donation from Henry Clay Folger, founder of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. The original garden was overshadowed by Austrian pines, so it was relocated in 1979. The modern-day Shakespeare Garden, sited just east of the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden, is one of two in New York City, the other being in Central Park. This English cottage garden has more than 80 plants that are mentioned in William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and poems. Plants are labeled with their common, Latin and Shakespearean names, relevant quotations, and in some cases a graphic representation of the plant. Some of the specimens in BBG&#x27;s Shakespeare Garden were not mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s work but were planted because they were suited to the climate of New York City.

===Alice Recknagel Ireys Fragrance Garden===

Next to the Shakespeare Garden, just north of the Laboratory Administration Building, is the Fragrance Garden. It was created by landscape architect Alice Recknagel Ireys. The Fragrance Garden was the first in the U.S. to be designed for the vision-impaired and has braille information signs for visitors with impaired vision. Visitors can rub the fragrant or pleasingly textured leaves of the plants between their fingers. There are four themed sections in the garden; plants to touch, plants with scented leaves, plants with fragrant flowers, and kitchen herbs. The garden is wheelchair-accessible, and all planting beds are high enough for people in wheelchairs to touch. There is also a fountain that is used as a washbasin.

===Children&#x27;s Garden===
The Children&#x27;s Garden, at the southeastern corner, is one of the world&#x27;s oldest children&#x27;s gardens, as well as the oldest in the U.S. It was founded by BBG educator Ellen Eddy Shaw and was initially divided into plots measuring or . The Children&#x27;s Garden has historically taught 200 to 300 children per season. Youth grow vegetables rather than flowers. A BBG staff member quoted in 1971 said that &quot;a variety of vegetables provides a greater range of examples of plant growth than flowers; many kinds grow quickly; and they provide a substantial and tangible reward for a child&#x27;s labor&quot;.

By the 2010s, the Children&#x27;s Garden attracted 1,000 youth per year. The Children&#x27;s Garden continues to operate as a community garden for children and is open to Garden Apprentice Program interns and to children between 2 and 17 years of age. It also has a compost area that is maintained by interns and staff.

=== Herb Garden ===
The Herb Garden, on the western boundary, contains fruit trees, corn stalks, cabbages, and other medicinal and agricultural plants. It includes 300 herb plants, including those used to create medicines and food flavors. Interspersed with the herbs are two knot-shaped Japanese barberry and boxwood hedges. The western portion of the hedge garden is a modern adaptation of a 1577 garden designed by Thomas Hill, while the eastern portion copies Hill&#x27;s original design. By 2001, the Herb Garden contained seven planting beds: six are divided by function and use, while the other planting bed is for miscellaneous herbs.

=== Discovery Garden ===
The Discovery Garden, designed for children, is at the southwest corner of BBG, next to the Flatbush Avenue entrance. It covers about and contains 250 trees, 2,600 grass specimens, and 9,500 perennials. It is divided into three portions that contain meadows, marshes, and woodlands. The garden includes a boardwalk that winds around four large trees, in addition to several exhibits and a &quot;hiding tree&quot; for children.

=== Water Garden ===
Located in the south-central section of BBG, the Shelby White and Leon Levy Water Garden is a wetland and riparian environment with numerous sustainability features. It contains a pond that serves as the terminus of the brook that flows from the Japanese Garden. A renovation of the Water Garden was completed in 2016. Designed by landscape architecture firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, the renovated Water Garden contains plants such as black tupelo, sedges and rushes.

===Other gardens and landscape features===

The Lily Pool Terrace, in front of the Laboratory Administration Building to the east, has two large display pools of lilies and koi fish and is surrounded by over 6,000 annuals and perennials. Mixed perennials are planted to the east of the Lily Pool Terrace, while annuals are planted to the west. The Elizabeth Scholtz Woodland Garden, at BBG&#x27;s northwest corner, contains an open-air &quot;walled garden&quot; surrounded by ruins which is intended to resemble a forest in the Northeastern U.S. The Louisa Clark Spencer Lilac Collection, also at the northwest corner near the Osborne Garden, contains 150 lilac bushes, which represent 20 species of lilacs. The Rock Garden, on the western boundary of BBG, contains alpine plants around 18 boulders left behind by glaciers during the Ice Age. On the western side of BBG, a bronze strip crosses a path, marking the former boundary of Brooklyn and Flatbush; a tablet marking the boundary line is mounted onto a nearby rock.

The Plant Family Collection, within the center of BBG, includes plants and trees arranged by family to show their evolution. Unlike the rest of BBG, the collection is not confined to a specific plot but is instead scattered across the botanical garden. The northern end of the collection is just south of the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden. From north to south, the collection contains primitive plants (ferns and conifers), ginkgos, beeches and birches, elm and pawpaw trees, laurels and roses, legumes and citruses, heath and olive families, and monocots. These are separated by a small stream.

A Celebrity Path honors famous Brooklynites such as Barbra Streisand, Woody Allen, and Walt Whitman with a trail of engraved paving stones. The Celebrity Path consists of concrete blocks and leads from a hill south of the Japanese Garden to the Alfred T. White Amphitheater. Outlines of leaves surround each of the names, which are laid in bronze letters. After Marty Markowitz became Brooklyn&#x27;s borough president in 2002, he stopped adding names to the path, but names are added from time to time. there are 151 names. The stones of Allen, alongside Alan Dershowitz, are often requested to be removed.

BBG also has an overlook along its northern border, known as the Robert W. Wilson Overlook. The overlook was built on a hill that was created using dirt excavated from the site of the neighboring Brooklyn Museum. Originally, the hill was intended as a terrace abutting the unbuilt southern wing of the Brooklyn Museum. The modern-day overlook sits atop BBG&#x27;s visitor center. The top of the overlook is above the rest of BBG. After the overlook was redesigned by Weiss/Manfredi in 2019, the hill was rebuilt with a curving path lined by retaining walls. The overlook has over 40,000 total specimens of plants.

== Structures ==
Because of the limited space available, most of Brooklyn Botanic Garden&#x27;s buildings are located on the eastern edge of the site. These structures include the Steinhardt Conservatory, the Laboratory Administration Building, the Palm House, and a house for the Children&#x27;s Garden.

=== Steinhardt Conservatory ===
The Steinhardt Conservatory occupies the eastern portion of Brooklyn Botanic Garden, just south of the Laboratory Administration Building. The conservatory consists of four structures: a main wing along Washington Avenue to the east, as well as three octagonal pavilions. These structures, each measuring up to tall, cover and are connected internally via tunnels. The facade of the conservatory is clad with of glass panes measuring . The metal on the exterior of the conservatory&#x27;s structures is painted green to match the color of the Laboratory Administration Building&#x27;s facade. The conservatory is twice the size of the Palm House, which it replaced.

The main conservatory building. measuring long, contains a bonsai museum, an aquatic greenhouse, and the Trail of Evolution exhibit. The lower part of the main wing has a stucco facade that is only visible from Washington Avenue, as well as a gabled entrance. The C. V. Starr Bonsai Museum hosts the second-oldest collection of bonsai in the U.S., behind Boston&#x27;s Arnold Arboretum. Originally composed of 32 bonsai, the collection later grew to between 600 and 2,000 bonsai; the museum usually displays 100 bonsai simultaneously. The Robert W. Wilson Aquatic House has a collections of tropical water plants, insect-eating plants, and orchids. The Trail of Evolution, named for BBG botanist Stephen K-M Tim, measures . It traces the history of plant evolution and the effects of climate change over 3.5 billion years.

A stairway descends beneath the main structure&#x27;s exterior terrace to the basements of the three octagonal pavilions. Each pavilion is accessed by a stairway leading from the basement, as well as stairways from the garden&#x27;s paths. The pavilions are themed to different climates and showcase tropical, warm temperate, and desert flora. The tropical pavilion, the largest of the three pavilions at , contains tropical plants and a waterfall. The desert pavilion hosts plants from American and North African deserts and is designed to resemble a desert environment. Finally, the temperate pavilion includes Mediterranean plants. The tops of each pavilion contain cupolas with ventilation openings.

=== Laboratory Administration Building ===

William M. Kendall of McKim, Mead &amp; White designed the Laboratory Administration Building (also known as the Laboratory Building or Administration Building), a New York City designated landmark, in the Tuscan Revival style. The structure measures across and was inspired by European churches, with a Greek cross layout as viewed from the air. The center section is topped by a terracotta cupola with round-arched windows, while the outer sections are topped by octagons with round-arched windows. Outside the building is Magnolia Plaza, which contains a circular compass rose and bronze armillary sphere. Created in 1932, Magnolia Plaza was named for Judith D. Zuk in 2005.

The Laboratory Administration Building&#x27;s facade is made of reinforced concrete and brick, covered with stucco. The building has hip roofs with Spanish tiles. The names of 68 famous botanists are inscribed in a frieze running across the building&#x27;s facade; these names were selected through a vote in 1911. The original main entrance is on the second floor of the western facade, accessed by a staircase. The modern-day main entrance is on the first story. A portico provided a secondary entrance on Washington Avenue.

When the Administration Building was completed, it was intended to contain laboratories and storage space. The main entrance led to a rotunda, which connected with a library to the east. The northern pavilion was intended for BBG&#x27;s offices, the director&#x27;s laboratory, and offices for various departments. The southern pavilion was intended to contain classrooms, instructor&#x27;s room, and various other laboratory rooms. The basement had service rooms and a lecture hall. By the 21st century, the Administration Building&#x27;s second floor contained BBG&#x27;s library, while the rest of the building was used for offices and as a visitor center.

=== Palm House ===
The Palm House was built as Brooklyn Botanic Garden&#x27;s original conservatory and was designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White. The central section of the Palm House measures across and high and was originally used for tropical plants. It is flanked by two wings each to the north and south, which each measure across. Originally, the northeast wing had classrooms, while the southwest, southeast, and northwest wings contained greenhouses; there were stables and other rooms under the southern wings. The interior of the Palm House is climate-controlled by a steam heating system.

During the 1980s, the Palm House was converted to an education center and event space, with a 300-seat restaurant. Part of the Palm House was also converted to host temporary exhibits. Since 2017, one wing of the Palm House has contained the Yellow Magnolia Café. By the 21st century, the Palm House was frequently being used for weddings, such as that of singer Art Garfunkel.

==Programs==
===Education programs===

From its inception in the early 20th century, BBG offered free lectures and classes to local students. In the 21st century, BBG has continued to operate programs in youth education, conservation, and community horticulture. BBG, Prospect Park Alliance, and New York City Department of Education operate the Brooklyn Academy of Science and the Environment (BASE), a small public high school dedicated to science, environmental studies, and urban ecology.

Since 2004, BBG&#x27;s Garden Apprentice Program has provided internships for students in grades 8 through 12 in gardening, science education, and environmental issues. Some of the teenagers with plots in the Children&#x27;s Garden also become junior instructors for that garden. The Discovery Garden hosts weekly workshops for children, with interactive exhibits and a small plot with a variety of vegetables. Project Green Reach, launched in 1990, is a science-focused school outreach program for teachers and students in grades K–8 in underserved neighborhoods.

===Plant science and conservation===
In BBG&#x27;s early years, officials hosted annual &quot;spring inspections&quot; for BBG members and invited guests. It also hosted events such as an annual Fall Rose Day. Scientists at Brooklyn Botanic Garden launched the New York Metropolitan Flora project, a comprehensive study of the plants of metropolitan New York City, in 1990. The study was intended to catalog and describe all vascular plants growing in the region.

BBG started creating magnolia cultivars in the 1950s. Among the species cultivated there were &quot;Magnolia × brooklynensis&quot;, three magnolia hybrid cultivars grown by BBG, as well as &quot;Magnolia&quot; &#x27;Elizabeth&#x27;, a yellow magnolia hybrid cultivar for which BBG received a patent in 1977.

The Brooklyn Botanic Garden Herbarium collection holds over 300,000 specimens representing over 1,400 species of preserved plants. These specimens, some from as early as 1818, aid scientists in tracking species, analyzing the spread of invasive plants, and modeling changes in the New York metropolitan area&#x27;s vegetation. There are also holdings from the western United States, the Galapagos Islands, Bolivia, and Mauritius. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden Library, which is housed in the Laboratory Administration Building, has a collection of books on horticulture and botany that is available to home gardeners, professionals, and staff.

===Community horticulture===
Since 1993, Brooklyn Botanic Garden has run the Community Greening program (formerly known as Brooklyn GreenBridge), which offers residential and commercial gardening programs to block associations, community gardens, community centers, and other groups. Under the Community Greening program, BBG has run the annual Greenest Block in Brooklyn contest since 1994, which gives awards in various categories. Since 1982, BBG has hosted Making Brooklyn Bloom, an annual event with various workshops and activities. The Community Greening program also includes the Community Garden Alliance, for community gardens in Brooklyn, and the Street Tree Stewardship program, for individual trees on streets. The NYC Compost Project (formerly the Urban Composting Project), supported by the New York City Department of Sanitation, offers composting assistance and resources, as well as information on composting in residential backyards.

==Publications and resources==
BBG began publishing a magazine, the &quot;Record&quot;, in February 1912; members received the publication for free. BBG&#x27;s director C. Stuart Gager was editor of the &quot;Record&quot; until his death in 1943. The last edition of the &quot;Record&quot; was published in 1944. BBG launched a series of gardening handbooks in 1945; the first volume in the series was &quot;Lilies and Their Culture: Use in the Garden&quot;. Brooklyn Botanic Garden&#x27;s &quot;Guides to a Greener Planet&quot; contain information on garden design, sustainability, and native plants. In addition, the botanical garden has published reference books such as the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; &quot;Botanic&quot; &quot;Garden&quot; &quot;Gardener&#x27;s Desk Reference&quot; (1998).

BBG launched its website in 1996. The website includes events, classes, and information on its gardens and collections, as well as a blog and practical gardening advice. BBG&#x27;s collection of historic photographs and lantern slides is also available online. The website includes an interactive map named CherryWatch, which tracks whether each cherry blossom tree has bloomed during the spring. The Laboratory Administration Building has a Gardener&#x27;s Resource Center that provides reference services.

== Former BBG properties ==
BBG formerly operated three other sites in the New York metropolitan area. The first to open was a research facility at Kitchawan Preserve in Westchester County, on land that it purchased from Elizabeth Van Brunt in 1956. Yorktown, New York, officials approved the research center in early 1959; the complex included a double-level laboratory near an abandoned railroad station on the New York and Putnam Railroad. After the research center opened in 1960, it was described as &quot;the most important single development since the founding of the Botanic Garden 50 years ago&quot;. The research center was originally known as the Kitchawan Research Laboratory. A herb garden and perennial border garden were dedicated at Kitchawan in 1981, and the research center was renamed the Brooklyn Botanic Garden Research Center in 1982. BBG sold off most of Kitchawan to the Westchester County government in 1988.

A second property in Westchester County, the Teatown Lake Reservation, was established in 1963, a year after Gerard Swope Sr. bequeathed to BBG. Over the years, the reservation grew through additional bequests. BBG and Teatown staff co-produced programming at the reservation until 1980, when Teatown began leasing the land from BBG, and the Teatown Lake Reservation became a legally separate entity in 1984. BBG continued to own a portion of the Teatown Lake Reservation until May 2018. BBG retains a conservation easement on the Teatown site.

The lawyer Grenville Clark donated the Clark Botanic Garden in Albertson, on Long Island, to BBG in 1966. BBG&#x27;s Fanny Dwight Clark Memorial Garden opened on the site in 1969, and BBG used the Clark Botanic Garden as an outreach station, with instructors from the Brooklyn Museum. The Clark Botanic Garden had three small lakes, as well as a children&#x27;s garden and a rock garden, which were similar to those in the original BBG. Although the Clark Botanic Garden was operated by BBG, the two gardens were legally separate entities, and the Clark Garden charged admission, whereas the original garden did not. The North Hempstead town government acquired Clark Botanic Garden from BBG in 1989.

== Membership, events, and operations ==
, BBG membership starts at $75 for individuals. Members can attend events in the spring and summer months, including themed sunset picnic nights. Each spring, a month-long cherry blossom viewing festival called &quot;Hanami&quot; is held at the Cherry Esplanade. This culminates in a weekend celebration called &quot;Sakura Matsuri&quot;, which was first hosted in the 1980s, although this event has not been held since the COVID-19 pandemic. Other events include the Chile Pepper Festival, which has been held annually since the 1990s, and Lightscape, a light art show that is hosted at the end of each year.

, BBG had an annual operating budget of $23 million. BBG recorded $20,869,967 in revenue and $20,988,655 in expenses for fiscal year 2020, meaning its net income was negative $118,688. BBG had more than 800,000 annual visitors .

<text>Eugene Francis &quot;Gene&quot; Fama (; born February 14, 1939) is an American economist, best known for his empirical work on portfolio theory, asset pricing, and the efficient-market hypothesis.

He is currently Robert R. McCormick Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In 2013, he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with Robert J. Shiller and Lars Peter Hansen. The Research Papers in Economics project ranked him as the 9th-most influential economist of all time based on his academic contributions, . He is regarded as &quot;the father of modern finance&quot;, as his works built the foundation of financial economics and have been cited widely.

== Early life and education ==
Fama was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Angelina (née Sarraceno) and Francis Fama. All of his grandparents were immigrants from Italy. Fama is a Malden Catholic High School Athletic Hall of Fame honoree. He earned his undergraduate degree in Romance Languages &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1960 from Tufts University, where he was also selected as the school’s outstanding student–athlete.

==Career==
Fama&#x27;s MBA and PhD came from the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago in economics and finance. His doctoral supervisors were Nobel prize winner Merton Miller and Harry V. Roberts, but Benoit Mandelbrot was also an important influence. He has spent the entirety of his teaching career at the University of Chicago.

His PhD thesis, which concluded that short-term stock price movements are unpredictable and approximate a random walk, was published in the January 1965 issue of the &quot;Journal of Business&quot;, entitled &quot;The Behavior of Stock Market Prices&quot;. That work was subsequently rewritten into a less technical article, &quot;Random Walks In Stock Market Prices&quot;, which was published in the &quot;Financial Analysts Journal&quot; in 1965 and &quot;Institutional Investor&quot; in 1968. His later work with Kenneth French showed that predictability in expected stock returns can be explained by time-varying discount rates; for example, higher average returns during recessions can be explained by a systematic increase in risk aversion, which lowers prices and increases average returns. His article &quot;The Adjustment of Stock Prices to New Information&quot; in the &quot;International Economic Review&quot;, 1969 (with several co-authors) was the first event study that sought to analyze how stock prices respond to an event, using price data from the newly available CRSP database. This was the first of literally hundreds of such published studies.

In 2013, he was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.

In 2019, the University of Chicago announced that one of the student houses of Woodlawn Residential Commons, which opened in 2020, would be named after Fama. 

===Efficient market hypothesis===

Fama is most often thought of as the father of the efficient-market hypothesis, which began with his PhD thesis. In 1965 he published an analysis of the behavior of stock market prices that showed that they exhibited so-called fat tail distribution properties, implying extreme movements were more common than predicted on the assumption of normality.

In an article in the May 1970 issue of the &quot;Journal of Finance&quot;, entitled &quot;Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work&quot;, Fama proposed two concepts that have been used on efficient markets ever since. First, Fama proposed three types of efficiency: (i) strong-form; (ii) semi-strong form; and (iii) weak efficiency. They are explained in the context of what information sets are factored in price trend. In weak form efficiency the information set is just historical prices, which can be predicted from historical price trend; thus, it is impossible to profit from it. Semi-strong form requires that all public information is reflected in prices already, such as companies&#x27; announcements or annual earnings figures. Finally, the strong-form concerns all information sets, including private information, are incorporated in price trend; it states no monopolistic information can entail profits, in other words, insider trading cannot make a profit in the strong-form market efficiency world.
Second, Fama demonstrated that the notion of market efficiency could not be rejected without an accompanying rejection of the model of market equilibrium (e.g. the price setting mechanism). This concept, known as the &quot;joint hypothesis problem&quot;, has ever since vexed researchers. Market efficiency denotes how information is factored in price, Fama (1970) emphasizes that the hypothesis of market efficiency must be tested in the context of expected returns. The joint hypothesis problem states that when a model yields a predicted return significantly different from the actual return, one can never be certain if there exists an imperfection in the model or if the market is inefficient. Researchers can only modify their models by adding different factors to eliminate any anomalies, in hopes of fully explaining the return within the model. The anomaly, also known as alpha in the modeling test, thus functions as a signal to the model maker whether it can perfectly predict returns by the factors in the model. However, as long as there exists an alpha, neither the conclusion of a flawed model nor market inefficiency can be drawn according to the Joint Hypothesis. Fama (1991) also stresses that market efficiency per se is not testable and can only be tested jointly with some model of equilibrium, i.e. an asset-pricing model.

===Fama–French three-factor model===

In recent years, Fama has become controversial again, for a series of papers, co-written with Kenneth French, that challenge the validity of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which posits that a stock&#x27;s beta alone should explain its average return. These papers describe two factors in addition to a stock&#x27;s market beta which can explain differences in stock returns: market capitalization and relative price. They also offer evidence that a variety of patterns in average returns, often labeled as &quot;anomalies&quot; in past work, can be explained with their Fama–French three-factor model.

=== Economic bubbles ===
Fama has expressed skepticism about the notion that economic bubbles can be identified. He argues that for something to be a bubble, its ending needs to be predicted in real time, not just after the fact. He argues that conventional rhetoric about bubbles proposes no testable propositions and no ways to measure a bubble.

Fama has been skeptical about the long-term viability of bitcoin, citing its extreme volatility, lack of intrinsic value, and violation of basic monetary principles.

<text>The VIC cipher was a pencil and paper cipher used by the Soviet spy Reino Häyhänen, codenamed &quot;VICTOR&quot;.

If the cipher were to be given a modern technical name, it would be known as a &quot;straddling bipartite monoalphabetic substitution superenciphered by modified double transposition.&quot;
However, by general classification it is part of the Nihilist family of ciphers.

It was arguably the most complex hand-operated cipher ever seen, when it was first discovered. The initial analysis done by the American National Security Agency (NSA) in 1953 did not absolutely conclude that it was a hand cipher, but its placement in a hollowed out 5¢ coin (later known as the Hollow Nickel Case) implied it could be decoded using pencil and paper. The VIC cipher remained unbroken until more information about its structure was available.

Although certainly not as complex or secure as modern computer operated stream ciphers or block ciphers, in practice messages protected by it resisted all attempts at cryptanalysis by at least the NSA from its discovery in 1953 until Häyhänen&#x27;s defection in 1957.

==A revolutionary leap==
The VIC cipher can be regarded as the evolutionary pinnacle of the Nihilist cipher family.

The VIC cipher has several important integrated components, including mod 10 chain addition, a lagged Fibonacci generator (a recursive formula used to generate a sequence of pseudorandom digits), a straddling checkerboard, and a disrupted double transposition.

Until the discovery of VIC, it was generally thought that a double transposition alone was the most complex cipher an agent, as a practical matter, could use as a field cipher.

==History==
During World War II, several Soviet spy rings communicated to Moscow Centre using two ciphers which are essentially evolutionary improvements on the basic Nihilist cipher. A very strong version was used by Max Clausen in Richard Sorge&#x27;s network in Japan, and by Alexander Foote in the Lucy spy ring in Switzerland. A slightly weaker version was used by the &quot;Rote Kapelle&quot; network.

In both versions, the plaintext was first converted to digits by use of a straddling checkerboard rather than a Polybius square. This has the advantage of slightly compressing the plaintext, thus raising its unicity distance and also allowing radio operators to complete their transmissions quicker and shut down sooner. Shutting down sooner reduces the risk of the operator being found by enemy radio direction finders. Increasing the unicity distance increases strength against statistical attacks.

Clausen and Foote both wrote their plaintext in English, and memorized the 8 most frequent letters of English (to fill the top row of the checkerboard) through the mnemonic phrase &quot;a sin to err&quot; (dropping the second &quot;r&quot;). The standard English straddling checkerboard has 28 character slots and in this cipher the extra two became &quot;full stop&quot; and &quot;numbers shift&quot;. Numbers were sent by a numbers shift, followed by the actual plaintext digits in repeated pairs, followed by another shift. Then, similarly to the basic Nihilist, a digital additive was added in, which was called &quot;closing&quot;. However a different additive was used each time, so finally a concealed &quot;indicator group&quot; had to be inserted to indicate what additive was used.

Unlike basic Nihilist, the additive was added by non-carrying addition (digit-wise addition modulo 10), thus producing a more uniform output which doesn&#x27;t leak as much information. More importantly, the additive was generated not through a keyword, but by selecting lines at random from almanacs of industrial statistics. Such books were deemed dull enough to not arouse suspicion if an agent was searched (particularly as the agents&#x27; cover stories were as businessmen), and to have such high entropy density as to provide a very secure additive. Of course the figures from such a book are not actually uniformly distributed (there is an excess of &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot; (see Benford&#x27;s Law), and sequential numbers are likely to be somewhat similar), but nevertheless they have much higher entropy density than passphrases and the like; at any rate, in practice they seem never to have been successfully cryptanalysed.

The weaker version generated the additive from the text of a novel or similar book (at least one &quot;Rote Kapelle&quot; member actually used &quot;The Good Soldier Schweik&quot;). This text was converted to a digital additive using a technique similar to a straddling checkerboard.

The ultimate development along these lines was the VIC cipher, used in the 1950s by Reino Häyhänen. By this time, most Soviet agents were instead using one-time pads. However, despite the theoretical perfection of the one-time pad, in practice they &quot;were&quot; sometimes broken due to reuse of &#x27;one-time&#x27; cipher pages in practice, while VIC was not.

==Mechanics overview==
The secret key for the encryption is the following:

* A short Phrase (e.g. the first line of a song, at least 20 letters long)
* A Date (written numerically, with no leading zeroes)
* A Personal Number (unique to agent, a 1 or 2 digit number)

The encryption was also aided by the adversary not knowing a 5-digit Keygroup which was unique to each message. The Keygroup was not strictly a &#x27;secret&#x27;, (as it was embedded in-clear in the ciphertext), but it was at a location in the ciphertext that was not known to an adversary.

The cipher broadly worked as follows:

# Use the secrets above (Phrase, Date, Keygroup and Personal Number) create a 50 digit block of pseudo random-numbers
# Use this block to create the message keys for:
## A Straddling Checkerboard
## Two Columnar transpositions
# Encrypt the Plaintext message via the straddling checkerboard
# Apply two transpositions to the resultant (intermediary) ciphertext through two columnar 
## A &#x27;Standard&#x27; Columnar Transposition 
## A Diagonal Columnar Transposition
# Insertion of the Keygroup into the ciphertext - as determined by the sixth digit of the Date

== Detailed mechanics ==
&quot;Note: this section tracks the calculations by referring to [Line-X] or similar. This is to align with the notation stated in the CIA archive description.&quot;

=== Pseudorandom block derivation ===

* [Line-A]: Generate a random 5-digit &quot;Keygroup&quot;
* [Line-B]: Write the first 5 digits of the secret &quot;Date&quot;
* [Line-C]: Subtract [Line-B] from [Line-A] by modular arithmetic (digit-by-digit, not &#x27;borrowing&#x27; any tens from a neighboring column)
* [Line-D]: Write out the first 20 letters from the secret &quot;Phrase&quot;
* [Line-E.1&amp;2]: &quot;Sequence&quot; (see below) the first and second ten characters separately (to get [Line-E.1] &amp; [Line-E.2] respectively)
* [Line-F.1]: Write out the 5-Digits from [Line-C], then apply &quot;Chain Addition&quot; (see below) applied to create five more digits
* [Line-F.2]: The digit sequence &#x27;1234567890&#x27; is written out (under [Line-E.2]) as an aide for encoding when creating [Line-H]
* [Line-G]: Addition of [Line-E.1] to [Line-F.1] - this is digit-by-digit by mod-10 arithmetic, i.e. no &#x27;carrying&#x27; over tens to the next column
* [Line-H]: &quot;Encoding&quot; (see below) of the digits in [Line-G] under [Line-E.2] as the key
* &quot;[Line-I]: No [Line-I] used, presumably to avoid confusion (as &#x27;I&#x27; may be misread as a &#x27;1&#x27; or &#x27;J&#x27;)&quot;
* [Line-J]: The &quot;Sequencing&quot; of [Line-H]
* [Lines-K,L,M,N,P]: These are five 10-digit lines created by chain addition of [Line-H]. The last two non-equal digits are added to the agent&#x27;s personal number to determine the key length of the 2 transpositions. (Lines K-to-P are in-effect a key-driven pseudo-random block used for the next stage of encryption)
* &quot;[Line-O]: No [Line-O] used, presumably to avoid confusion (as &#x27;O&#x27; may be misread as a zero or &#x27;Q&#x27;)&quot;

=== Message key derivation ===

* [Line-Q]: The first &#x27;a&#x27; digits (where &#x27;a&#x27; is the first value resulting from the addition of the last non-equal digits in [Line-P] to the Personal Number) extracted from [Lines-K,L,M,N,P] when transposed via [Line-J]. This transposition is done by writing out the columns of numbers underneath the digits in [Line-J], beginning with the column of numbers underneath the digit ‘1&#x27;, then the column beneath the digit ‘2’, and so on in numerical order, until &#x27;a&#x27; digits have been written out (in the example below, the value of &#x27;a&#x27; would be 13, so this transposition would carry on for 13 digits). These digits are used as the key to the Columnar Transposition. 
* [Line-R]: The next &#x27;b&#x27; digits (where &#x27;b&#x27; is the second value resulting from the addition of the last non-equal digits in [Line-P] to the Personal Number) extracted (after the &#x27;a&#x27; digits have been extracted) from [Lines-K,L,M,N,P] when transposed via [Line-J]. This transposition is done in the same manner as [Line-Q], but is carried on from the previous transposition, meaning it may start mid-column under the digit of [Line-J] where the last transposition left off (in the example below, [Line-R] starts mid-way through the column underneath the digit &#x27;3&#x27; in [Line-J]). These resulting digits are used to key the Diagonal Transposition. 
* [Line-S]: The Sequencing of [Line-P], this is used as the key to the Straddling Checkerboard.

=== Example of key generation ===
=== Message encryption ===

==== Straddling checkerboard ====
Once the key has been generated, the first stage of actually encrypting the Message is to convert it to a series of digits via a straddling checkerboard. The key (header row) for the checkerboard is based on [Line-S]. Then a pre-agreed series of common letters used on the second row. The example below uses the English mnemonic &#x27;AT ONE SIR&#x27;; however, the Cyrillic mnemonic used by Hayhanen was &#x27;snegopad&#x27;, the Russian word for snowfall.

The remaining cells are filled in, with the rest of the alphabet filled in in order, followed by codice_1 (fullstop) and codice_2 (number-shift symbol, indicating that the following symbols until the next number-shift are numbers; see example below).
An example encoding is below, where numbers :
 MESSAGE: &#x27;Attack at dawn. By dawn I mean 0500. Not 0915 like you did last time.&#x27;
 Encoding of individual symbols:
 A T T A C K A T D A W N (...) 0 9 1 5
 5 9 9 5 69 64 5 9 66 5 83 3 80 000 999 111 555 80
 Final code:
 59956 96459 66583 38765 88665 83376 02538 00005 
 55000 00080 87319 80000 99911 15558 06776 42881
 86667 66675 49976 0287-

==== Transpositions: columnar transposition ====
The message is transposed via standard columnar transposition keyed by [Line-Q] above. (Note: if the message encoded length is not a multiple of 5 at this stage, an additional digit is added)

The message is then transposed via Diagonal Transposition keyed by [Line-R] above. The meaning of &#x27;diagonal&#x27; in this case is that triangular disruption zones were employed to make the transposition irregular.

===== Keygroup insertion =====
The (unencrypted) Keygroup is inserted into the ciphertext &#x27;P&#x27; groups from the end; where &#x27;P&#x27; is the unused sixth digit of the Date.

===== Modular addition/subtraction =====
Modular addition or subtraction, also known as &#x27;false adding/subtraction&#x27;, in this context (and many pen and paper ciphers) is digit-by-digit addition and subtraction without &#x27;carrying&#x27; or &#x27;borrowing&#x27;. For example:

* 1234 + 6789 = 7913
* 1234 - 6789 = 5555

===== Sequencing =====
Sequencing in this context is ordering the elements of an input from 1-10 (where &#x27;0&#x27; represents 10). This occurs either to letters (whereby alphabetical order is used), or numbers (where numerical value is used). In the event of equal values, then the leftmost value is sequenced first. For example:

* LETTERS: The word &#x27;Octopus&#x27; is sequenced as &#x27;2163475&#x27; - (i.e. C=1, first &#x27;O&#x27;=2, second &#x27;O&#x27;=3, ...)
* NUMBERS: The number &#x27;90210&#x27; is sequenced as &#x27;34215&#x27; - (by numerical order. Zero is valued at &#x27;10&#x27; in terms of ordering)

===== Chain addition =====
Chain addition is akin to a linear-feedback shift register, whereby a stream of number is generated as an output (and fed back in as an input) to a seed number. Within the VIC Cipher chain addition works by (1) taking the original (seed) number, (2) false-adding the first two digits, (3) putting this new number at the end of the chain. This continues, however the digits being added are incremented by one. For example, if the seed was &#x27;90210&#x27;, the first 5 iterations are shown below:

 90210           // Initial seed value
 90210 9         // 9 = 9+0 (first two digits)
 90210 92        // 2 = 0+2 (next two...)
 90210 923       // 3 = 2+1
 90210 9231      // 1 = 1+0
 90210 92319     // 9 = 0+9; note how the first &#x27;9&#x27; generated is being fed back in

===== Digit encoding =====
The encoding step replaces each digit in a number (i.e. [Line-G] in the cipher) with one from a key sequence (i.e. [Line-E.2]) that represents its position in the 1-10 ordering. It should be seen that by writing out the series &#x27;1234567890&#x27; (shown as [Line-F.2]) underneath [Line.E.2] each value from 0-9 has another above it. Simply replace every digit in the number to be encoded with the one above it in the key sequence. 
For example, the number &#x27;90210&#x27; would have encodings as follows; formula_1.

So the output would be: &#x27;27067&#x27;.

=== Decryption ===
Decryption of the VIC Cipher is as follows:

* Extract the Keygroup - By knowledge of the sixth digit of the secret Date, remove the 5 digits of the Keygroup from the ciphertext
* Generate the Message Keys - By using the knowledge of the various secrets (Phrase, Date, Personal Number, Keygroup) generate the keys in the same manner as the encryption process
* Decrypt the Ciphertext - By using knowledge of the Message Keys for the transpositions and straddling checkerboard decrypt them

== Cryptanalysis ==
The cipher is one of the strongest pen and paper ciphers actually used in the real world, and was not broken (in terms of determining the underlying algorithm) by the NSA at the time. However, with the advent of modern computing, and public disclosure of the algorithm this would not be considered a strong cipher. It can be observed that the majority of the entropy in the secret key converges to a 10-digit number [Line-H]. This 10-digit number is approximately 34 bits of entropy, combined with the last digit of the date (needed to identify where the KeyGroup is) would make about 38 bits of entropy in terms of Message Key strength. 38 bits is subject to a Brute-force attack within less than a day on modern computers.

<doc id="301237" wikidata="Q158813" url="?curid=301237" title="Mike Huckabee">
<text>Michael Dale Huckabee (, born August 24, 1955) is an American political commentator, Baptist minister, and former politician who served as the 44th governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007. He was a candidate for the Republican Party presidential nomination in both 2008 and 2016.

He is the host of the talk show &quot;Huckabee&quot;, which ran on the Fox News Channel from 2008 to 2015, and has run on TBN since October 2017. He paused the show in January 2015 in order to explore a potential bid for the presidency. From April 2012 through December 2013, he hosted a daily radio program, &quot;The Mike Huckabee Show&quot;, on weekday afternoons for Cumulus Media Networks. Huckabee is an ordained Southern Baptist pastor noted for his Evangelical views, a musician, and a public speaker. He has written several books, and was previously a political commentator on &quot;The Huckabee Report&quot;.

In the 2008 Republican presidential primaries, Huckabee won the 2008 Iowa Republican caucuses and finished second in delegate count and third in both popular vote and number of states won, behind John McCain and Mitt Romney. Huckabee ran again for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election but withdrew early in the primary following the Iowa caucus.

Huckabee is the father of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the governor of Arkansas since 2023 and a former White House press secretary.

On November 12, 2024, it was announced that President-elect Donald Trump would be nominating Huckabee as United States ambassador to Israel. Trump stated that Huckabee would &quot;bring peace to the Middle East.&quot;

==Early life==
Huckabee was born on August 24, 1955, in Hope, Arkansas, the son of Dorsey Wiles Huckabee (1923–1996) and his wife Mae (Elder) Huckabee (1925–1999), conservative Southern Democrats. Huckabee is of English, German, and Scots-Irish ancestry, with roots in America dating to the Colonial Era. He has cited his working-class upbringing as the reason for his political views; his father worked as a fireman and mechanic, and his mother worked as a clerk at a gas company.

His first job, when he was 14, was at a radio station, where he read the news and weather. He was elected governor of Arkansas by his chapter of the American Legion-sponsored Boys State program in 1972. He was student council vice president at Hope High School during the 1971–1972 school year. He was student council president at Hope High School during the 1972–1973 school year. He has one sister, Pat Harris, a middle school teacher. He entered the ministry in 1972 at Garrett Memorial Baptist Church in Hope.

Huckabee married Janet McCain on May 25, 1974. He graduated from Ouachita Baptist University on May 8, 1978, completing his bachelor&#x27;s degree in religion before attending Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He dropped out of the seminary after one year in order to take a job in Christian broadcasting.

==Pastoral career==

At age 21, Huckabee was a staffer for televangelist James Robison. Robison commented, &quot;His convictions shape his character and his character will shape his policies. His whole life has been shaped by moral absolutes.&quot; Prior to his political career, he served as pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, from 1980 to 1986, and the Beech Street First Baptist Church in Texarkana, from 1986 to 1992.

Huckabee started 24-hour television stations in both Pine Bluff and Texarkana, where he produced documentaries and hosted a program called &quot;Positive Alternatives&quot;. He encouraged the all-white Immanuel Baptist Church to accept black members in the mid-1980s. Years later, he wrote about the insights he gained as a minister:

In 1989, Huckabee ran against Ronnie Floyd of Springdale for the presidency of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention. Huckabee won and served as president from 1989 to 1991.

Huckabee has received two honorary doctorates: a Doctor of Humane Letters, received from John Brown University in 1991, and a Doctor of Laws from Ouachita Baptist University in 1992.

==Political career==

===Lieutenant Governor of Arkansas, campaign 1992===

In Huckabee&#x27;s first political race in 1992, he lost to incumbent Democratic senator Dale Bumpers, receiving 40 percent of the vote in the general election. In the same election, Arkansas governor Bill Clinton was elected president, making lieutenant governor Jim Guy Tucker the new governor when Clinton resigned the governorship. In 1993, Republican state chairman Asa Hutchinson urged Huckabee to run in the special election for lieutenant governor held on July 27. Realizing his loss came among key conservative Democrats, Huckabee ran a decidedly conservative campaign. In the subsequent general election, he defeated Nate Coulter, who had been Bumpers&#x27;s campaign manager the previous year, 51–49 percent. Huckabee became the second Republican since Reconstruction to serve as Arkansas lieutenant governor, the first having been Maurice Britt from 1967 to 1971.

In his autobiography &quot;From Hope to Higher Ground&quot;, Huckabee recalled the chilly reception that he received from the Arkansas Democratic establishment on his election as lieutenant governor: &quot;The doors to my office were spitefully nailed shut from the inside, office furniture and equipment were removed, and the budget spent down to almost nothing prior to our arriving. After fifty-nine days of public outcry, the doors were finally opened for me to occupy the actual office I had been elected to hold two months earlier.&quot;

Dick Morris, who had previously worked for Bill Clinton, advised Huckabee on his races in 1993, 1994, and 1998. Huckabee commented that Morris was a &quot;personal friend&quot;. A newspaper article reported on Huckabee&#x27;s 1993 win: &quot;Morris said the mistake Republicans always make is that they are too much of a country club set. What we wanted to do was run a progressive campaign that would appeal to all Arkansans.

Morris elaborated, &quot;So we opened the campaign with ads that characterized Mike as more of a moderate whose values were the same as those of other Arkansans.&quot; Consequently, he abandoned his earlier support for the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC) when in April 1994 following an adverse media campaign against the CofCC, Huckabee withdrew from a speaking engagement before their national convention. He repeated the accusations made by various media and civil rights organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center recalling his past association with the CofCC saying, &quot;I will not participate in any program that has racist overtones. I&#x27;ve spent a lifetime fighting [against] racism and anti-Semitism.&quot;

In 1994, Huckabee was re-elected to a full term as lieutenant governor, beating Democratic candidate Charlie Cole Chaffin with nearly 59 percent of the vote. While lieutenant governor, Huckabee accepted $71,500 in speaking fees and traveling expenses from a nonprofit group, Action America. R. J. Reynolds was the group&#x27;s largest contributor.

In October 1995, David Pryor announced that he was retiring from the United States Senate. Huckabee then announced he was running for the open seat and moved ahead in the polls, but ultimately dropped out of the race to lead the state after incumbent governor Jim Guy Tucker resigned following his fraud and conspiracy convictions.

During his campaign, Huckabee opposed in December then-governor Tucker&#x27;s plan for a constitutional convention. The plan was defeated by voters, 80–20 percent, in a special election. In January 1996, Huckabee campaigned in televised ads paid for by the Republican National Committee and the Arkansas Republican Party against a highway referendum. Tucker supported the referendum, which included tax increases and a bond program, to improve of highway. On the referendum, the bond question, which included a sales tax increase and a gas tax increase, lost 87–13 percent. A second question, a five-cent increase on diesel tax, lost 86–14 percent. Huckabee also opposed Tucker&#x27;s plan for school consolidation.

===Governor of Arkansas, 1996–2007===
In May 1996, Tucker was convicted &quot;on one count of arranging nearly $3 million in fraudulent loans&quot; as part of the Whitewater controversy. The Arkansas Constitution, like nearly all state constitutions in the United States, does not allow convicted felons to hold office. Tucker thus promised to resign by July 15. Huckabee then announced he would quit the Senate race and instead fill the unexpired term of Tucker. However, Tucker, insisting he had a strong case for appeal, rescinded his resignation as Huckabee was preparing to be sworn in on July 15. Within a few hours, Tucker reinstated his resignation after Huckabee and the legislature threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against Tucker. Huckabee was then duly sworn in as governor.

In November 1998, Huckabee was elected to a full four-year term by defeating retired colonel Gene McVay in the primary and Jonesboro attorney and Democratic candidate Bill Bristow in the general election, becoming the state&#x27;s third elected Republican governor since Reconstruction.
According to a CNN exit poll, Huckabee received 48% of the African American vote in his 1998 election; but some experts have questioned whether those numbers are a representative sample on how he did on the whole in the election.

In 2001, Huckabee was named &quot;Friend of a Taxpayer&quot; by Americans for Tax Reform for his cut in statewide spending.

In November 2002, Huckabee was reelected to his second four-year term by defeating State Treasurer Jimmie Lou Fisher, garnering 53 percent of the vote. His reelection came despite the defeat in the general election of fellow Republican U.S. Senator Tim Hutchinson.

Huckabee received widespread praise for his state&#x27;s rapid response to Hurricane Katrina. In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; named him one of the five best governors in the U.S., writing &quot;Huckabee has approached his state&#x27;s troubles with energy and innovation&quot; and referred to him as &quot;a mature, consensus-building conservative who earns praise from fellow Evangelicals and, occasionally, liberal Democrats.&quot; &quot;Governing&quot; magazine likewise honored Huckabee as one of its 2005 Public Officials of the Year. Additionally, he was among those legislators given the APHA Distinguished Public Health Legislator of the Year Award by the American Public Health Association for that same year.

In 2006, he was presented with AARP&#x27;s Impact Award for his health initiatives.

In December 2008, Huckabee became an honorary member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He said that did not have time to join a fraternity in college because he had to &quot;cram four years into a little more than two&quot;. The fraternity&#x27;s CEO said they were &quot;very impressed with his character and the initiatives he headed&quot; as governor.

By the end of his term, Huckabee held the 3rd-longest tenure of any Arkansas governor. Only Democrats Orval Faubus, who served 6 consecutive 2-year terms (1955–1967), and Bill Clinton, who served 11 years, 11 months (1979–1981; 1983–1992), had longer tenures.

During his tenure as governor, Huckabee supported tax reforms including tax cuts and increases, that netted $505 million for the state. According to columnist Margaret Carlson, that money was used to improve roads, health care and schools in the state.

====Clemencies====
As governor, Huckabee commuted and accepted recommendations for pardon for twice as many sentences as his 3 predecessors combined; in total: 1,033 prisoners. Twelve had previously been convicted of murder. Though Huckabee pardoned more than his predecessors, the state prison size and number of people executed were greater as well, Huckabee denied 92% of all clemency requests during his 10.5 years as governor. Most pardons and commutations were not for prisoners but for those whose sentences had ended and who were seeking work. Huckabee&#x27;s pardons and commutations became an issue during the 2008 Republican Primary, with most of the controversy focusing on Wayne Dumond.

Huckabee&#x27;s handling of clemency petitions received national attention in November 2009 with the case of Maurice Clemmons, who had committed burglary without a weapon at 16. The Prison Transfer Board unanimously requested a sentence commutation for Clemmons as did the trial judge. Clemmons&#x27;s 60-year sentence was commuted by Huckabee to 47 years, making him eligible for parole if approved by the parole board. After parole in 2000, Clemmons was arrested for multiple offenses including child molestation and aggravated assault but was released after prosecutors declined to file charges. After Clemmons murdered four police officers in Lakewood, Washington, a two-day manhunt ensued, and Clemmons was shot and killed by a Seattle Police Department officer after refusing police orders to stop charging the officer. In his book about the shooting, &quot;The Other Side of Mercy&quot;, Jonathan Martin of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; wrote that Huckabee apparently failed to review Clemmons&#x27;s prison file, which was &quot;thick with acts of violence and absent indications of rehabilitation&quot;. Huckabee defended his actions, stating that the recommendation to reduce the sentence was unanimous and supported by the trial judge, that the decision to parole him was made by the parole board, not him, and that Clemmons had been re-arrested and the decision not to file charges then had nothing to do with him.

===2008 presidential election campaign===

Huckabee announced his run for the White House on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on January 28, 2007.

At the August 11 Iowa Straw Poll, Huckabee took second place with 2,587 votes, roughly 18 percent, splitting the conservative Republican party votes amongst other candidates. Huckabee spent $57.98 per vote in the Straw Poll, which is the lowest among the top three finishers. Huckabee drew attention with an unconventional ad featuring Chuck Norris. In a later ad Huckabee wished voters a merry Christmas, and said that &quot;what really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ.&quot;

In November 2007, Huckabee drew endorsements from a large number of religious activists, including Billy McCormack, a pastor in Shreveport, Louisiana, and a director and vice president of the Christian Coalition of America, founded in 1988 by a previous presidential candidate, Pat Robertson. He was criticized for using a bookshelf that resembled a cross in a Christmas commercial as a form of signaling to Christians, and laughed them off saying &quot;I will confess this: If you play the spot backwards, it says, &#x27;Paul is dead. Paul is dead. He also faced a &quot;drumbeat&quot; of questions about the role of faith in his gubernatorial administration and about past statements he made in 1998 about the U.S. being a &quot;Christian nation&quot; in which he said, &quot;I hope we answer the alarm clock and take this nation back for Christ.&quot; Huckabee told NBC that his comment was not politically incorrect and was &quot;appropriate to be said to a gathering of Southern Baptists&quot;. Huckabee has credited God with some of his political success.

On January 3, 2008, Huckabee won the Iowa Republican caucuses, receiving 34% of the electorate and 17 delegates, compared with the 25% of Mitt Romney, who finished second, receiving 12 delegates; Fred Thompson, who came in third place and received three delegates; John McCain, who came in fourth place and received three delegates; and Ron Paul, who came in fifth place and received two delegates.
On January 8, 2008, Huckabee finished in third place in the New Hampshire primary, behind John McCain in first place, and Mitt Romney who finished second, with Huckabee receiving one more delegate for a total of 18 delegates, gained via elections, and 21 total delegates, versus 30 total (24 via elections) for Romney, and 10 for McCain (all via elections).

On January 15, 2008, Huckabee finished in third place in the 2008 Michigan Republican primary, behind John McCain in second place; Mitt Romney, who finished first; and ahead of Ron Paul, who finished in fourth place.
On January 19, 2008, Huckabee finished in second place in the 2008 South Carolina Republican primary, behind John McCain, who finished first and ahead of Fred Thompson, who finished third.

On January 21, 2008, Huckabee received the endorsement of 50 African American leaders in Atlanta, Georgia. The endorsers cited Huckabee&#x27;s record on abortion, education, minorities, the economy, the prison system, and immigration as Arkansas governor. However, NBC reported that the endorsement of African American leaders at the Atlanta event was 36, and &quot;most of them connected to conservative religious organizations&quot;.

On January 29, 2008, Huckabee finished in fourth place in the Florida primary, behind Rudy Giuliani in third, Mitt Romney in second, and John McCain in first place.

On February 5, 2008, Huckabee won the first contest of &quot;Super Tuesday&quot;, the West Virginia GOP state convention, but only after the McCain campaign provided their delegates, thereby giving Huckabee 52% of the electorate to Mitt Romney&#x27;s 47%. Backers of rival John McCain said they threw Huckabee their support to prevent Mitt Romney from capturing the winner-take-all GOP state convention vote. Consequently, he also registered victories in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Tennessee on Super Tuesday, bringing his delegate count up to 156, compared with 689 for Republican party front-runner John McCain.
On February 9, 2008, Huckabee won the first election following Super Tuesday, by winning 60% of the vote in the Kansas Republican Caucuses.
This was also the first contest to be held without Mitt Romney, who was said to be splitting the conservative vote with Huckabee. Huckabee also won the Louisiana Republican Primary with 44% of the vote to John McCain&#x27;s 43% in second. Although Huckabee won the primary he was not awarded any delegates, because of state party rules that stated a candidate must pass the 50% threshold to receive the state&#x27;s pledged delegates.

On March 4, 2008, Huckabee withdrew from seeking the candidacy as it became apparent he would lose in Texas, where he had hoped to win, and that John McCain would get the 1,191 delegates required to win the Republican nomination. Huckabee finished the race with 240 pledged delegates.

====Vice presidential candidate speculation====

Even though Huckabee had signed a television contract and a book deal with a pressing deadline, he was mentioned by most to be on then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain&#x27;s short list for his vice presidential running mate. The late pundit Tim Russert even referred to Huckabee as &quot;Vice President Huckabee&quot; several times when he appeared on &quot;Meet The Press&quot; on May 18, 2008. Huckabee was eventually passed over for Sarah Palin.

Former president Bill Clinton has praised Huckabee and stated that he is a rising star in the Republican Party. Clinton and Huckabee have collaborated on initiatives such as the fight against childhood obesity. Former Tennessee Republican Party chairman and Huckabee&#x27;s former campaign manager Chip Saltsman has called Governor Huckabee, &quot;The most successful failed presidential candidate in the history of our country&quot;.

===Speculated 2012 presidential campaign===
In a November 19, 2008, article by the Associated Press, Huckabee addressed the possibility of running for president in 2012. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m not ruling anything out for the future, but I&#x27;m not making any specific plans.&quot;

Amid speculation about a future run for the presidency, a CNN poll in December 2008 found Huckabee at the top of the list of 2012 GOP contenders, along with former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin, fellow 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.

On December 3, 2008, Cincinnati-based NBC affiliate WLWT asked Huckabee about the prospect of running, to which he said, &quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be out there. Whether it&#x27;s for myself or somebody else I may decide will be a better standard bearer, that remains to be seen.&quot;

A June 2009 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation national poll showed Huckabee as the 2012 presidential co-favorite of the Republican electorate along with Palin and Romney. An October 2009 poll of Republicans by Rasmussen Reports put Huckabee in the lead with 29%, followed by Romney on 24% and Palin on 18%. In a November 2009 Gallup poll, Huckabee was shown as the leading Republican contender for 2012. In November 2010 CNN projected in a poll that Huckabee would defeat Barack Obama in a hypothetical 2012 contest. In a Rasmussen poll taken January 11–14, 2011, Huckabee was even with Obama at 43% each.

Huckabee took stances opposed to the nature of the incumbent president, Barack Obama. In comments made March 1, 2011, on &quot;The Steve Malzberg Show&quot;, Huckabee said of Obama, &quot;I would love to know more. What I know is troubling enough. And one thing that I do know is his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits, for example, is very different than the average American.&quot; (This is a reference to the Mau Mau Uprising against the colonial rule of the United Kingdom in 1952; Obama himself has never lived in Kenya.)

On May 14, 2011, Huckabee announced on his FNC show that he would not be a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012. Despite his high national poll numbers and being seen by many as the front runner, Huckabee declined to run, saying, &quot;All the factors say &#x27;go,&#x27; but my heart says &#x27;no.

===2016 presidential campaign===

Political commentators speculated that Huckabee might be ready for another presidential run in 2016. He was limited by a lack of money in 2008 but with changes to federal election law allowing SuperPACs to pour large sums of money into a race he might be better positioned to stay in the race. Huckabee has in addition earned personal wealth since 2008 on the lecture circuit and his TV and radio shows. He ended his daily radio show in December 2013, which strengthened speculations about a presidential bid.

Huckabee indicated in September 2014 that he would make the decision on whether to run early in 2015. In January 2015, Huckabee ended his show on FNC to prepare for his possible run in the 2016 presidential election. On March 30, 2015, Huckabee supporters launched a Super PAC to make preparations for his run for the presidential ticket in 2016.

On May 5, 2015, in his hometown of Hope, Arkansas, Huckabee announced a campaign to seek the Republican nomination for president of the United States in the 2016 election. In his speech, Huckabee attacked trade deals that he said drive down U.S. wages, opposed raising the age for Social Security benefits, criticized President Obama for what he said was putting more pressure on Israel than Iran, and made an unusual plea for donations of $15 or $25 a month, saying: &quot;I will ask you to give something in the name of your children and grandchildren.&quot;

On February 1, 2016, after a disappointing showing in the Iowa caucus Huckabee decided that he was going to suspend his campaign.

===2018 Florida gubernatorial election===
Reports emerged in the summer of 2016 that Huckabee, who currently lives in Florida, was considering running for governor of Florida in 2018 to succeed term limited Republican incumbent Rick Scott. However, Huckabee later announced that he was declining to run in the 2018 Florida Gubernatorial election. Had he run and won, he would have become the first person to serve as governor of two separate states since Sam Houston, who served as governor of Tennessee and later as governor of Texas. Before his announcement not to run, an August 2016 poll of Florida Republicans conducted by StPetePolls.org showed Huckabee leading a field of potential Republican gubernatorial candidates with 37%.

===First Trump administration===
Following the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Huckabee met with president-elect of the United States Donald Trump, whom he had supported for the Republican nomination after ending his own campaign in February. It was reported by &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; that Trump offered Huckabee the position of United States Ambassador to Israel. Huckabee denied the reports. He told Fox News that a possible cabinet appointment for himself was discussed but that he turned the offer down, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure it was the right fit.&quot;

His daughter Sarah Huckabee Sanders served as White House press secretary to President Donald Trump from July 2017 until July 2019.

In January 2018, Huckabee praised Doha, Qatar as being &quot;surprisingly beautiful, modern, and hospitable&quot; after a trip there, but did not reveal that a foreign agent for Qatar had paid $50,000 to a corporation run by Huckabee as a &quot;honorarium for visit&quot;.

Following Trump&#x27;s defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, Huckabee supported Trump&#x27;s legal challenges in closely contested states, stating, &quot;I think he owes it to all of us to make sure the election was fair. I am not saying it wasn&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t know. But we need to know, we have to have an answer to the questions that linger.&quot; On November 15, in a letter addressed to Joe Biden first posted on his website, Huckabee made unsubstantiated claims of election fraud in the 2020 election.

===Second Trump administration===
On November 12, 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Huckabee as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel. On February 12, 2025, his nomination was sent to the Senate. His nomination is pending before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

==Media career==
On June 12, 2008, Fox News announced it was hiring Huckabee as a political commentator and regular contributor to their 2008 American presidential election coverage, in their New York election headquarters.

Huckabee filled in for Paul Harvey in July 2008. A few months later, he signed a deal with ABC Radio Networks (now Cumulus Media Networks) to carry a daily commentary, &quot;The Huckabee Report&quot;, beginning in January 2009. After Harvey&#x27;s death his show replaced Harvey&#x27;s broadcasts. On April 15, 2015, Huckabee announced that &quot;The Huckabee Report&quot; would be ending May 1.

Huckabee hosted a weekend show, &quot;Huckabee&quot;, on Fox News Channel, which premiered Saturday, September 27, 2008, at 8 PM EST. For six weeks in summer 2010, Fox test-ran &quot;The Huckabee Show&quot; for the syndicated market; Huckabee was joined by guest co-hosts in the daily spin-off, among them Bob Barker of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; fame. &quot;Huckabee&quot; ended on January 3, 2015, so that Huckabee could consider the possibility of running for president.

On April 2, 2012, Huckabee launched a long-form daily talk show on Cumulus Media Networks, who provide the call-in guests. The show, which is targeted at second-tier broadcast stations, features long-form interviews and discussions and airs in the noon to 3 p.m. time slot, directly opposite the market leader in talk radio, &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;. On November 27, 2013, Huckabee announced that the show will have its final broadcast on December 12, 2013, stating that he and Cumulus Media mutually decided not to renew the contract.

In a December 2013 interview, Huckabee stated that he would be launching a news organization in partnership with Christian Media Corp. International.

In October 2017, the Huckabee show was relaunched, now produced by and aired on the Trinity Broadcasting Network.

==Political positions==
===Abortion===

Huckabee opposes any public funding for abortion, and believes that abortion should be legal only when the life of the mother is at risk. He stated that it would &quot;most certainly&quot; be a good day for America if &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; were reversed by the Supreme Court. This ultimately occurred in 2022 with the landmark Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case.

===Health care===

Huckabee opposed President Obama&#x27;s health care plan, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He stated that he wants to &quot;give citizens more control over their own health care choices&quot;.

===Free trade===

In his book &quot;From Hope to Higher Ground&quot;, Huckabee expressed support for free trade, but only if it is &quot;fair trade.&quot; He identified excess litigation, excess taxation, and excess regulation as three factors contributing to the loss of American jobs, and has proposed economic sanctions on China.

===Race relations===

According to a CNN exit poll, Huckabee won 48% of African-American votes in his successful 1998 gubernatorial race in Arkansas. The 48% figure is often disputed due to the exit poll&#x27;s small sample size. Huckabee says that it is important for Republicans such as himself to reach out to black voters, and in 2015, he ramped up efforts to win those votes.

In 2015, on an episode of &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Huckabee stated that the confederate flag issue was for South Carolinians to decide, &quot;not an issue for a person running for president&quot;, and days later, he congratulated Governor Nikki Haley on her decision to support the removal of the flag from the state capitol. Huckabee gave a speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention that included this: &quot;I say with sincerity that I have great respect for Senator Obama&#x27;s historic achievement to become his party&#x27;s nominee—not because of his color, but with indifference to it. Party or politics aside, we celebrate this milestone because it elevates our country.&quot;

===LGBT rights===

Huckabee believes that marriage is between one man and one woman, and he opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions. In 2006, he outlawed same-sex marriage in Arkansas; however, in 2007, he stated that Americans should &quot;respect&quot; gay couples. He says that adoptions should be child focused and opposes &quot;gay adoptions&quot;. Huckabee, expounding upon his view on homosexuality, said the following:

In January 2015, he compared homosexuality to &quot;drinking and swearing&quot;, insofar as it is &quot;part of a lifestyle&quot;. Huckabee has stated he has gay friends, saying, &quot;People can be my friends who have lifestyles that are not necessarily my lifestyle. I don&#x27;t shut people out of my circle or out of my life because they have a different point of view[.]&quot;

===Conceiving children outside marriage===

In comments which he made on March 4, 2011, on the &quot;Michael Medved Show&quot;, Huckabee spoke about pregnant, unwed actress Natalie Portman, saying &quot;it&#x27;s unfortunate we glorify and glamorize the idea of out-of-wedlock children.&quot;

In January 2014, in a luncheon speech at the Republican National Committee&#x27;s winter meeting, in response to a federal mandate on contraception, Huckabee stated that &quot;Democrats want to insult the women of America by making them believe that they are helpless without coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control, they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of the government.&quot;

===Role of religion in public life===

Huckabee has voiced his belief in intelligent design and he has also stated that he does not believe that Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution is valid. In July 2004, he was quoted on &quot;Arkansans Ask&quot;, his regular show on the Arkansas Educational Television Network: &quot;I think that students also should be given exposure to the theories not only of evolution but to the basis of those who believe in creationism.&quot;

In April 2011, Huckabee said, &quot;I almost wish that there would be a simultaneous telecast and all Americans would be forced, at gunpoint, to listen to every David Barton message,&quot; in praise of the Christian revisionist author David Barton.

Within hours of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Huckabee made headlines in the U.S. and abroad for stating on Fox News: &quot;We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we have systematically removed God from our schools,&quot; and he further asked, &quot;Should we be so surprised that schools would become a place of carnage?&quot;

In September 2014, Huckabee said, &quot;Fire the ones who refuse to hear not only our hearts, but God&#x27;s heart&quot; (for which he was criticized by Richard Dawkins).

In September 2015, speaking about his support of religious freedom on behalf of Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to radio host Michael Medved, Huckabee said, &quot;Michael, the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision of 1857 still remains to this day the law of the land which says that black people aren&#x27;t fully human. Does anybody still follow the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision?&quot; (The decision in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; had been superseded by the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and nullified by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.)

In June 2016, Huckabee, along with actor Pat Boone and executive producer Troy Duhon, all of whom were involved in the film &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead 2&quot;, sent a letter to California governor Jerry Brown opposing Senate Bill 1146, which &quot;prohibits a person from being subjected to discrimination&quot; at California colleges. Other than religious schools—those that train pastors and theology teachers—schools &quot;might no longer be allowed to hire Christian-only staff, teach religious ideas in regular classes, require attendance at chapel services or keep bathrooms and dormitories restricted to either males or females.&quot;

===Climate change===
In 2023, Huckabee published &quot;Kids Guide to the Truth About Climate Change&quot;, which minimized the influence of human emissions on global warming. Marketed as an alternative to mainstream education, the publication does not attribute authorship or cite scientific credentials. The deputy director of the National Center for Science Education called the publication &quot;propaganda&quot; and &quot;very unreliable as a guide to climate change for kids&quot;, noting that it represented &quot;present day&quot; atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide as 280 parts per million (ppm), which was true in 391 BC but short of 2023&#x27;s actual concentration of 420 ppm.

===Military===
In 2007, Huckabee argued for a larger military and an increase in defense spending, writing, &quot;Right now, we spend about 3.9 percent of our GDP on defense, compared with about six percent in 1986, under President Ronald Reagan. We need to return to that six percent level.&quot;

===Immigration===

During his 2016 bid for president, Huckabee released a nine-point immigration enforcement and border security plan. It plan included building a border fence, increased border patrol personnel, and increased visas for skilled workers who enter the country legally. Huckabee has previously stated he is opposed to using military resources for border patrol. Huckabee&#x27;s plan also required all 11–12 million undocumented immigrants to register with the federal government and return to their home countries within 120 days. Failure to do so would carry a ten-year ban from entering the US.

===Gun control===

Huckabee has voiced his support for self-defense and the Castle Doctrine, and has generally taken an anti-gun control stance. He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed.

===Fiscal policy===

As governor of Arkansas, Huckabee received grades of B in 1998, C in 2000, C in 2002, D in 2004, and F in 2006 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America&#x27;s Governors.

===Israel &amp; Palestine===
Huckabee is a strong supporter of Israel, opposing Palestinian statehood and rejecting Palestinian identity. Huckabee has also condoned West Bank settlements which are illegal under international law. In 2008, Huckabee argued that there is &quot;no such thing as a Palestinian&quot;. In 2017, at an event in the West Bank, he stated: &quot;There is no such thing as a West Bank - it&#x27;s Judea and Samaria. There&#x27;s no such thing as a settlement. They&#x27;re communities. They&#x27;re neighborhoods. They&#x27;re cities. There&#x27;s no such thing as an occupation.&quot;

He described the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, as &quot;horrific&quot; and &quot;beyond anything I’ve ever witnessed in my lifetime.&quot;

== Public image ==
Huckabee has both detractors and defenders, even among Republicans. Personality descriptions range from friendly, charming and warm, to petty and aloof. He has received support from African-American leaders, praise from a liberal &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist, and criticism from gay rights groups and pundits. Huckabee has made controversial public statements that have brought criticism. He apologized for at least three statements and has admitted that his love for metaphors and tendency to use hyperbole to make a point has backfired on him.

==Personal life==

===Music===
Huckabee plays the electric bass guitar in his classic-rock cover band, Capitol Offense. The group has played for political events and parties, including entertaining at unofficial inaugural balls in Washington, D.C., in January 2001.

In 2007, Huckabee was given the Music for Life Award by the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) for his music education advocacy.

===Organizations===
Huckabee was made the chair of the Southern Governors&#x27; Association in 1999 and served in capacity through 2000. He has chaired the Southern Growth Policies Board, the Southern Regional Education Board, the Southern Technology Council, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, and the Education Commission of the States. He is also a member of the Republican Governors Association and former chairman of the National Governors Association. Huckabee is chairman of the conservative political action committees Vertical Politics Institute and Huck PAC.

In 2006, Huckabee was initiated as an honorary member of Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) Fraternity, motivated in part by his son David being an involved TKE member at Arkansas State University.

In July 2010, Huckabee became a fundraiser on behalf of for-profit Victory University in Memphis, Tennessee, and was designated Chancellor of the Victory University Foundation.

Huckabee was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Kennedy Center by President Donald Trump in March 2019. His term on the board expired in September 2024.

===Weight loss and advocacy of good health===
When he was elected governor of Arkansas, Huckabee was obese. In 2003, physicians diagnosed him with type 2 diabetes, and they also informed him that he would not live more than 10 years if he did not lose weight. Huckabee acknowledges that he has weighed as much as . Coupled with the death of former Governor Frank D. White (whose obesity contributed to a fatal heart attack) his diagnosis prompted Huckabee to begin eating healthier and exercising. He subsequently lost over . &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the weight loss so rapid that &quot;it was as if he simply unzipped a fat suit and stepped out.&quot;

Although Huckabee has stated that he never smoked and he never drank alcohol, he declared himself a &quot;recovering foodaholic&quot;. Huckabee has publicly recounted his previous burdens as an obese man: the steps of the Arkansas capitol from the entrance of the building up to the Governor&#x27;s office were so long and steep that he would be out of breath and exhausted by the time he reached the top of the stairs. Huckabee has discussed his weight loss and used health care reform as a major focus of his governorship.

At an August 2007 forum on cancer which was hosted by Lance Armstrong, Huckabee said that he would support the imposition of a federal smoking ban, but since then, he has stated that he believes that the issue is best addressed by state and local governments.

Huckabee has completed several marathons: the 2005 Marine Corps Marathon, the 2005 and 2006 Little Rock Marathon, and the 2006 New York City Marathon. The 2005 Little Rock Marathon featured an impromptu challenge between Huckabee and Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack. Huckabee completed the marathon in 4:38:31, defeating Vilsack by 50 minutes. He wrote a book chronicling his weight-loss experience, &quot;Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork&quot;. Huckabee was one of 10 recipients of a 2006 AARP Impact Award acknowledging his work as a &quot;health crusader&quot;.

In 2009, Huckabee acknowledged that he had gained back a quarter of his weight due to a foot condition that prevented him from running.

<text>RSA Security LLC, formerly RSA Security, Inc. and trade name RSA, is an American computer and network security company with a focus on encryption and decryption standards. RSA was named after the initials of its co-founders, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, after whom the RSA public key cryptography algorithm was also named. Among its products is the SecurID authentication token. The BSAFE cryptography libraries were also initially owned by RSA. RSA is known for incorporating backdoors developed by the NSA in its products. It also organizes the annual RSA Conference, an information security conference.

Founded as an independent company in 1982, RSA Security was acquired by EMC Corporation in 2006 for US$2.1 billion and operated as a division within EMC. When EMC was acquired by Dell Technologies in 2016, RSA became part of the Dell Technologies family of brands. On 10 March 2020, Dell Technologies announced that they will be selling RSA Security to a consortium, led by Symphony Technology Group (STG), Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board (Ontario Teachers’) and AlpInvest Partners (AlpInvest) for US$2.1 billion, the same price when it was bought by EMC back in 2006.

RSA is based in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, with regional headquarters in Bracknell (UK) and Singapore, and numerous international offices.

==History==

Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who developed the RSA encryption algorithm in 1977, founded RSA Data Security in 1982. The company acquired a &quot;worldwide exclusive license&quot; from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to a patent on the RSA cryptosystem technology granted in 1983.
* In 1994, RSA was against the Clipper chip during the Crypto War.
* In 1995, RSA sent a handful of people across the hall to found Digital Certificates International, better known as VeriSign.
* The company then called &quot;Security Dynamics&quot; acquired &quot;RSA Data Security&quot; in July 1996 and &quot;DynaSoft AB&quot; in 1997.
* In January 1997, it proposed the first of the DES Challenges which led to the first public breaking of a message based on the Data Encryption Standard.
* In February 2001, it acquired &quot;Xcert International, Inc.&quot;, a privately held company that developed and delivered digital certificate-based products for securing e-business transactions.
* In June 2001, it acquired &quot;3-G International, Inc.&quot;, a privately held company that developed and delivered smart card and biometric authentication products.
* In August 2001, it acquired &quot;Securant Technologies, Inc.&quot;, a privately held company that produced ClearTrust, an identity management product.
* In December 2005, it acquired Cyota, a privately held Israeli company specializing in online security and anti-fraud solutions for financial institutions.
* In April 2006, it acquired &quot;PassMark Security&quot;.
* On September 14, 2006, RSA stockholders approved the acquisition of the company by EMC Corporation for $2.1 billion.
* In 2007, RSA acquired Valyd Software, a Hyderabad-based Indian company specializing in file and data security.
* In 2009, RSA launched the RSA Share Project. As part of this project, some of the RSA BSAFE libraries were made available for free. To promote the launch, RSA ran a programming competition with a US$10,000 first prize.
* In March 2011, RSA suffered a security breach and its most valuable secrets were leaked, compromising the security of all existing RSA SecurID tokens.
* In 2011, RSA introduced a new CyberCrime Intelligence Service designed to help organizations identify computers, information assets and identities compromised by trojans and other online attacks.
* In July 2013, RSA acquired Aveksa the leader in Identity and Access Governance sector
* On September 7, 2016, RSA was acquired by and became a subsidiary of Dell EMC Infrastructure Solutions Group through the acquisition of EMC Corporation by Dell Technologies in a cash and stock deal led by Michael Dell.
* On February 18, 2020, Dell Technologies announced their intention to sell RSA for $2.075 billion to Symphony Technology Group.
* In anticipation of the sale of RSA to Symphony Technology Group, Dell Technologies made the strategic decision to retain the BSAFE product line. To that end, RSA transferred BSAFE products (including the Data Protection Manager product) and customer agreements, including maintenance and support, to Dell Technologies on July 1, 2020.
* On September 1, 2020, Symphony Technology Group (STG) completed its acquisition of RSA from Dell Technologies. RSA became an independent company, one of the world’s largest cybersecurity and risk management organizations.

==Controversy==

===SecurID security breach===


On March 17, 2011, RSA disclosed an attack on its two-factor authentication products. The attack was similar to the Sykipot attacks, the July 2011 SK Communications hack, and the NightDragon series of attacks. RSA called it an advanced persistent threat. Today, SecurID is more commonly used as a software token rather than older physical tokens.

===Relationship with NSA===
RSA&#x27;s relationship with the NSA has changed over the years. Reuters&#x27; Joseph Menn and cybersecurity analyst Jeffrey Carr have noted that the two once had an adversarial relationship. In its early years, RSA and its leaders were prominent advocates of strong cryptography for public use, while the NSA and the Bush and Clinton administrations sought to prevent its proliferation.

In the mid-1990s, RSA and Bidzos led a &quot;fierce&quot; public campaign against the Clipper Chip, an encryption chip with a backdoor that would allow the U.S. government to decrypt communications. The Clinton administration pressed telecommunications companies to use the chip in their devices, and relaxed export restrictions on products that used it. (Such restrictions had prevented RSA Security from selling its software abroad.) RSA joined civil libertarians and others in opposing the Clipper Chip by, among other things, distributing posters with a foundering sailing ship and the words &quot;Sink Clipper!&quot; RSA Security also created the DES Challenges to show that the widely used DES encryption was breakable by well-funded entities like the NSA.

The relationship shifted from adversarial to cooperative after Bidzos stepped down as CEO in 1999, according to Victor Chan, who led RSA&#x27;s department of engineering until 2005: &quot;When I joined there were 10 people in the labs, and we were fighting the NSA. It became a very different company later on.&quot; For example, RSA was reported to have accepted $10 million from the NSA in 2004 in a deal to use the NSA-designed Dual EC DRBG random number generator in their BSAFE library, despite many indications that Dual_EC_DRBG was both of poor quality and possibly backdoored. RSA Security later released a statement about the Dual_EC_DRBG kleptographic backdoor:

In March 2014, it was reported by Reuters that RSA had also adapted the extended random standard championed by NSA. Later cryptanalysis showed that extended random did not add any security, and it was rejected by the prominent standards group Internet Engineering Task Force. Extended random did however make NSA&#x27;s backdoor for Dual_EC_DRBG tens of thousands of times faster to use for attackers with the key to the Dual_EC_DRBG backdoor (presumably only NSA) because the extended nonces in extended random made part of the internal state of Dual_EC_DRBG easier to guess. Only RSA Security&#x27;s Java version was hard to crack without extended random since the caching of Dual_EC_DRBG output in e.g. RSA Security&#x27;s C programming language version already made the internal state fast enough to determine. And indeed, RSA Security only implemented extended random in its Java implementation of Dual_EC_DRBG.

===NSA Dual_EC_DRBG backdoor===
From 2004 to 2013, RSA shipped security software—BSAFE toolkit and Data Protection Manager—that included a default cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator, Dual EC DRBG, that was later suspected to contain a secret National Security Agency kleptographic backdoor. The backdoor could have made data encrypted with these tools much easier to break for the NSA, which would have had the secret private key to the backdoor. Scientifically speaking, the backdoor employs kleptography, and is, essentially, an instance of the Diffie Hellman kleptographic attack published in 1997 by Adam Young and Moti Yung.

RSA Security employees should have been aware, at least, that Dual_EC_DRBG might contain a backdoor. Three employees were members of the ANSI X9F1 Tool Standards and Guidelines Group, to which Dual_EC_DRBG had been submitted for consideration in the early 2000s. The possibility that the random number generator could contain a backdoor was &quot;first raised in an ANSI X9 meeting&quot;, according to John Kelsey, a co-author of the NIST SP 800-90A standard that contains Dual_EC_DRBG. In January 2005, two employees of the cryptography company Certicom—who were also members of the X9F1 group—wrote a patent application that described a backdoor for Dual_EC_DRBG identical to the NSA one. The patent application also described three ways to neutralize the backdoor. Two of these—ensuring that two arbitrary elliptic curve points P and Q used in Dual_EC_DRBG are independently chosen, and a smaller output length—were added to the standard as an option, though NSA&#x27;s backdoored version of P and Q and large output length remained as the standard&#x27;s default option. Kelsey said he knew of no implementers who actually generated their own non-backdoored P and Q, and there have been no reports of implementations using the smaller outlet.

Nevertheless, NIST included Dual_EC_DRBG in its 2006 NIST SP 800-90A standard with the default settings enabling the backdoor, largely at the behest of NSA officials, who had cited RSA Security&#x27;s early use of the random number generator as an argument for its inclusion. The standard did also not fix the unrelated (to the backdoor) problem that the CSPRNG was predictable, which Gjøsteen had pointed out earlier in 2006, and which led Gjøsteen to call Dual_EC_DRBG not cryptographically sound.

ANSI standard group members and Microsoft employees Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson made a public presentation about the backdoor in 2007. Commenting on Shumow and Ferguson&#x27;s presentation, prominent security researcher and cryptographer Bruce Schneier called the possible NSA backdoor &quot;rather obvious&quot;, and wondered why NSA bothered pushing to have Dual_EC_DRBG included, when the general poor quality and possible backdoor would ensure that nobody would ever use it. There does not seem to have been a general awareness that RSA Security had made it the default in some of its products in 2004, until the Snowden leak.

In September 2013, the &quot;New York Times&quot;, drawing on the Snowden leaks, revealed that the NSA worked to &quot;Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, networks, and endpoint communications devices used by targets&quot; as part of the Bullrun program. One of these vulnerabilities, the &quot;Times&quot; reported, was the Dual_EC_DRBG backdoor. With the renewed focus on Dual_EC_DRBG, it was noted that RSA Security&#x27;s BSAFE used Dual_EC_DRBG by default, which had not previously been widely known.

After the &quot;New York Times&quot; published its article, RSA Security recommended that users switch away from Dual_EC_DRBG, but denied that they had deliberately inserted a backdoor. RSA Security officials have largely declined to explain why they did not remove the dubious random number generator once the flaws became known, or why they did not implement the simple mitigation that NIST added to the standard to neutralize the suggested and later verified backdoor.

On 20 December 2013, Reuters&#x27; Joseph Menn reported that NSA secretly paid RSA Security $10 million in 2004 to set Dual_EC_DRBG as the default CSPRNG in BSAFE. The story quoted former RSA Security employees as saying that &quot;no alarms were raised because the deal was handled by business leaders rather than pure technologists&quot;. Interviewed by CNET, Schneier called the $10 million deal a bribe. RSA officials responded that they have not &quot;entered into any contract or engaged in any project with the intention of weakening RSA’s products.&quot; Menn stood by his story, and media analysis noted that RSA&#x27;s reply was a non-denial denial, which denied only that company officials knew about the backdoor when they agreed to the deal, an assertion Menn&#x27;s story did not make.

In the wake of the reports, several industry experts cancelled their planned talks at RSA&#x27;s 2014 RSA Conference. Among them was Mikko Hyppönen, a Finnish researcher with F-Secure, who cited RSA&#x27;s denial of the alleged $10 million payment by the NSA as suspicious. Hyppönen announced his intention to give his talk, &quot;Governments as Malware Authors&quot;, at a conference quickly set up in reaction to the reports: TrustyCon, to be held on the same day and one block away from the RSA Conference.

At the 2014 RSA Conference, former RSA Security Executive Chairman Art Coviello defended RSA Security&#x27;s choice to keep using Dual_EC_DRBG by saying &quot;it became possible that concerns raised in 2007 might have merit&quot; only after NIST acknowledged the problems in 2013.

==Products==
RSA is most known for its SecurID product, which provides two-factor authentication to hundreds of technologies utilizing hardware tokens that rotate keys on timed intervals, software tokens, and one-time codes. In 2016, RSA re-branded the SecurID platform as RSA SecurID Access. This release added Single-Sign-On capabilities and cloud authentication for resources using SAML 2.0 and other types of federation.

The RSA SecurID Suite also contains the RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle software (formally Aveksa). The software provides visibility of who has access to what within an organization and manages that access with various capabilities such as access review, request and provisioning.

RSA enVision is a &quot;security information and event management&quot; (SIEM) platform, with centralised log-management service that claims to &quot;enable organisations to simplify compliance process as well as optimise security-incident management as they occur.&quot; On April 4, 2011, EMC purchased NetWitness and added it to the RSA group of products. NetWitness was a packet capture tool aimed at gaining full network visibility to detect security incidents. This tool was re-branded RSA Security Analytics and was a combination of RSA enVIsion and NetWitness as a SIEM tool that did log and packet capture.

The RSA Archer GRC platform is software that supports business-level management of governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC). The product was originally developed by Archer Technologies, which EMC acquired in 2010.

<text>The Staten Island Ferry is a fare-free passenger ferry route operated by the New York City Department of Transportation. The ferry&#x27;s single route runs through New York Harbor between the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island, with ferry boats completing the trip in about 25 minutes. The ferry operates 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with boats leaving every 15 to 20 minutes during peak hours and every 30 minutes at other times. Apart from NYC Ferry&#x27;s St. George route, it is the only direct mass-transit connection between the two boroughs. Historically, the Staten Island Ferry has charged a relatively low fare compared to other modes of transit in the area; and since 1997, the route has been fare-free. The Staten Island Ferry is one of several ferry systems in the New York City area and is operated separately from systems like NYC Ferry and NY Waterway.

The Staten Island Ferry route terminates at Whitehall Terminal, on Whitehall Street in Lower Manhattan, and at St. George Terminal, in St. George, Staten Island. At Whitehall, connections are available to the New York City Subway and several local New York City Bus routes. At St. George, there are transfers to the Staten Island Railway and to the St. George Bus Terminal&#x27;s many bus routes. Using MetroCard fare cards, passengers from Manhattan can exit a subway or bus on Whitehall Street, take the ferry for free, and have a free second transfer to a train or bus at St. George. Conversely, passengers from Staten Island can freely transfer to a subway or bus in Manhattan after riding the ferry.

The Staten Island Ferry originated in 1817 when the Richmond Turnpike Company started a steamboat service from Manhattan to Staten Island. Cornelius Vanderbilt bought the Richmond Turnpike Company in 1838, and it was merged with two competitors in 1853. The combined company was in turn sold to the Staten Island Railroad Company in 1864. The Staten Island Ferry was then sold to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1884, and the government of New York City assumed control of the ferry in 1905.

In the early 20th century, the city and private companies also operated ferry routes from Staten Island to Brooklyn. Owing to the growth of vehicular travel, all of the routes from Staten Island to Brooklyn were decommissioned by the mid-1960s; but popular demand preserved the route to Manhattan. By 1967, the Staten Island-to-Manhattan ferry was the only commuter ferry within the entire city. A fast ferry route from Staten Island to Midtown Manhattan ran briefly from 1997 to 1998; proposals to revive the route resurfaced in the 2010s.

With riders in , the Staten Island Ferry is the busiest ferry route in the United States and the world&#x27;s busiest passenger-only ferry system, thanks largely to the lack of other transit connections between Staten Island and the other boroughs. The ferry is also popular among tourists and visitors due to the free-of-charge views of the New York Harbor a trip provides. The ferry has been featured in several films.

== History ==
=== Predecessors ===
Before the New York City area was colonized by Europeans, the indigenous Lenape Native Americans used boats to traverse waterways—including present-day Arthur Kill, Kill Van Kull, and Raritan Bay—of the area then known as Lenapehoking, which included present-day Staten Island, Manhattan, and New Jersey. The area would first be colonized as part of Dutch New Netherland in 1624. New Netherland became the British Province of New York in 1664, and the British province finally became part of the United States in 1776. During the 18th century, the City of New York occupied only the southern tip of Manhattan, and Staten Island was not incorporated within the greater city. At the time, ferry service along New York Harbor between Staten Island and Manhattan was conducted by private individuals in &quot;periaugers&quot;. These shallow-draft, two-masted sailboats, used for local traffic in New York Harbor, were also used for other transport in the area.

=== Early years ===
Cornelius Vanderbilt, an entrepreneur from Stapleton, Staten Island, who would become one of the world&#x27;s richest people, started a ferry service from Staten Island to Manhattan in 1810. Just 16 years old, he had sailed extensively enough in his father&#x27;s periauger that he could easily navigate the New York Harbor Estuary on his own. He was given $100 for his birthday in May 1810, which he used to purchase a periauger called &quot;Swiftsure&quot;. Vanderbilt used his boat to transport passengers from Staten Island to the Battery at Manhattan&#x27;s tip. He competed against other boatmen providing service in the harbor, who called him &quot;Commodore&quot; because of his youthful eagerness; although the nickname was intended to be jocular, it applied to him for the rest of his life. The War of 1812 meant restricted access to New York Harbor from elsewhere along the East Coast. During the war, Vanderbilt profited from carrying cargo along the Hudson River, and he bought extra boats with these profits. After the war, he transported cargo in the harbor, earning even more money and buying more boats.

Around the same time, U.S. Vice President Daniel D. Tompkins secured a charter for the Richmond Turnpike Company as part of his efforts to develop the village of Tompkinsville, which would become Staten Island&#x27;s first European settlement. The company was incorporated in 1815, and the land comprising Tompkinsville was purchased around this time. The company built a highway across Staten Island; it also received the right to run a ferry to New York. The Richmond Turnpike Company began to operate the first motorized ferry between New York and Staten Island in 1817, &quot;Nautilus&quot;, which was commanded by Captain John DeForest, the brother-in-law of Cornelius Vanderbilt. This new ferry broke the short monopoly on steamboat operations that had been held by the Fulton Ferry, which had connected Manhattan and Brooklyn since it began operation in 1814. Since the steamboats provided much faster means of transportation across the harbor, Vanderbilt sold all his ships to his father in 1818. He subsequently started working for Thomas Gibbons, a small-steamboat operator, operating steamboat lines for Gibbons in New Jersey before later operating his own lines in New York.

When Tompkins died in 1825, the company&#x27;s stocks were placed in a trust at the Fulton Bank in lower Manhattan. Under an act passed in 1824, the bank was to be incorporated under two conditions: it had to acquire the Richmond Turnpike Company&#x27;s stock, and it would cease operations in 1844. Vanderbilt, who had grown wealthy in the steamboat business in New York waters, bought control of the Richmond Turnpike Company in 1838. After the company&#x27;s original charter expired in 1844, Vanderbilt transferred the former company&#x27;s leases and titles to himself and the company&#x27;s other chief officer, Oroondates Mauran. This was done in their capacity as private citizens rather than as chief officers. When Mauran died in 1848, his share of the company was purchased by Vanderbilt.

By the mid-18th century, there were three separate ferry companies offering services between lower Manhattan and the eastern shore of Staten Island. The Tompkins and Staples Ferry, operated by Vice President Tompkins&#x27;s son Minthorne, ran from a pier at the Tompkinsville end of the highway to Whitehall Street in lower Manhattan. The New York and Staten Island Steam Ferry Company, or &quot;People&#x27;s Ferry&quot;, was operated by George Law and ran from Stapleton, Staten Island, to Liberty Street, Manhattan. The third ferry was the Richmond Turnpike Ferry, also the &quot;Staten Island Ferry&quot;; it originated at Vanderbilt&#x27;s Landing at Clifton, Staten Island, and terminated in Manhattan. All of these companies merged in 1853, after Vanderbilt, who was focused on business ventures elsewhere, convinced Law and Tompkins to buy out his ferry company for $600,000. Vanderbilt remained a dominant figure in the ferry business until the Civil War in the early 1860s.

The combined company, the Staten Island and New York Ferry Company, ran services from Whitehall Street to Tompkinsville, Stapleton, and Clifton. It originally ran single-ended boats but eventually expanded its fleet to include double-ended boats. The Staten Island and New York Ferry&#x27;s vessel &quot;Hunchback&quot; was built in 1852, becoming the first double-decked boat to operate in the harbor. To accommodate growing ridership, three double-ended boats—&quot;Southfield I&quot;, &quot;Westfield I&quot;, and &quot;Clifton I&quot;—were purchased for the ferry between 1857 and 1861. &quot;Westfield&quot; and &quot;Clifton&quot; were purchased by the Union Army in September 1861, almost immediately after they had been delivered. The army also purchased &quot;Hunchback&quot; and &quot;Southfield&quot; in December of that year. The Union used the ships to man the blockade against the Confederate Army during the Civil War. Of the four boats, only &quot;Hunchback&quot; survived; after the war, it was redocumented and bought by someone in Boston; it was abandoned by 1880. Due to the loss of these boats, another three boats—&quot;Westfield II&quot;, &quot;Northfield&quot;, and &quot;Middletown&quot;—were obtained in 1862–1863. A fourth boat, &quot;Clifton II&quot;, was also built, but it was purchased by the U.S. shortly after completion; the vessel was then redocumented, and by 1868 it had been destroyed.

=== Staten Island Railway era ===
The Staten Island Railway (SIR) opened in stages in 1860. It was necessary to have a direct connection between the new railroad trains and the infrequent ferries to and from Manhattan, but this turned out to be difficult during the beginning of operation. The ferries serving Vanderbilt&#x27;s Landing were owned by George Law, who operated a competing ferry service called the New York and Staten Island Steam Ferry. Afterwards, Vanderbilt tried to operate a ferry service between Manhattan and Staten Island that would rival Law&#x27;s ferry service. Vanderbilt started construction on his plan for a central dock on the island, but he abandoned the scheme after a storm destroyed the timber work. Only the large stone foundation remained; this was still visible in 1900 at low tide.

A long franchise battle ensued; and as a result, Vanderbilt sold his ferry service to Law in 1862. Vanderbilt subsequently lost interest in Staten Island&#x27;s transit operations, and he handed the operations of the ferry and railroad over to his brother, Jacob Vanderbilt, who was the president of the company until 1883. In March 1864, Vanderbilt bought Law&#x27;s ferries, bringing both the railroad and the ferries under the same company. The railway assumed the Staten Island and New York Ferry Company&#x27;s operations in 1865.

On July 30, 1871, &quot;Westfield II&quot; was damaged when its boiler exploded while sitting in its slip at South Ferry in Manhattan. Within days of the disaster, between 45 and 91 had died, and from 78 to 208 listed as injured, although figures varied widely between the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Herald&quot;, &quot;Tribune&quot;, and &quot;World&quot;. Among those injured was Antonio Meucci, an Italian immigrant who was developing the first telephone at the time; he was so poor that his wife sold his lab and telephone prototype to buy $6 worth of medications. Jacob Vanderbilt was arrested for murder, though he escaped conviction. This had an adverse effect on the railroad&#x27;s finances; and on March 28, 1872, the railway and the ferry went into receivership. On September 17, 1872, the property of the company was sold to George Law in foreclosure, with the exception of the ferryboat &quot;Westfield II&quot;, which was purchased by Horace Theall.

Erastus Wiman, a Canadian entrepreneur, planned to develop Staten Island by adding transit. Wiman had become one of Staten Island&#x27;s most notable figures since moving to New York in 1867, and he had built an amusement area on the island to help develop it. He incorporated the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company on March 25, 1880; and the incorporation of the company was formalized on April 14, 1880. Two years later, Wiman applied to build a ferry dock in Manhattan in order to serve his new ferry routes. Wiman also proposed combining the six to eight separate ferry operations so as to use just one Staten Island terminal. This became the St. George ferry landing, which opened in March 1886.

On April 3, 1883, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company gained control of the SIR and its boats. A new boat, &quot;Southfield II&quot;, was delivered that year. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) obtained control of the Staten Island Railway Ferry Company&#x27;s operations the next year. A controlling interest in the Railway Ferry Company was obtained by the B&amp;O in 1885, through purchases of stock. On November 21, 1885, Robert Garrett, president of the B&amp;O, leased the Railway Ferry Company to the B&amp;O for 99 years. The B&amp;O could now provide service to a ferry terminal that was closer to Manhattan public transit. Formerly, passengers had to transfer to the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ)&#x27;s ferries, which went from the Jersey City Terminal to the Liberty Street Ferry Terminal in Manhattan; and the latter was not close to any elevated rail stations in the area. With this acquisition, the B&amp;O could start operating ferries to the Whitehall Street terminal, where there was a direct transfer to an elevated station. Two steel-hulled ferryboats were built during this time and delivered in 1888. These boats were &quot;Erastus Wiman&quot; (renamed &quot;Castleton&quot; in 1894) and &quot;Robert Garrett&quot;. They were the first boats of the Staten Island Railway Ferry fleet to be powered by multi-cylinder inclined steam engines, which pumped steam more efficiently than the single-cylinder vertical engines on previous boats.

Garrett resigned from his position at the B&amp;O in 1887, and his successors did not show as much interest in Staten Island transit operations. Wiman lost significant amounts of money in the Panic of 1893; and two years later, much of his property was auctioned to pay off debts.

In 1893, the B&amp;O commenced plans to divert some CNJ ferries from Jersey City to Whitehall Street, with the latter ordering &quot;Easton&quot; and &quot;Mauch Chunk&quot; ferries for the Whitehall Street service. The boats started running in 1897. As part of a general improvement, the B&amp;O also started building a new ferry terminal at St. George in 1895.

In 1899, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR) formed a partnership in which they were to buy smaller freight railroad companies. PRR president Alexander Cassatt had devised the plan because he thought that two large freight-shipping companies, Standard Oil and Carnegie Steel, were artificially depressing freight-shipping rates by cajoling smaller companies for rebates. Among the PRR&#x27;s acquisitions was the B&amp;O, which in turn owned the Staten Island Railway and Ferry. Cassatt started buying B&amp;O stock in 1899 and owned much of the B&amp;O stock two years later.

=== End of Staten Island Railway era ===

By the 1900s, Staten Islanders were becoming dissatisfied with the railway-operated ferry service to Manhattan, which they felt was unsafe. The turning point came on June 14, 1901, when the CNJ ferry &quot;Mauch Chunk&quot; struck the B&amp;O ferryboat &quot;Northfield II&quot; as the latter was leaving the ferry port at Whitehall, tearing a hole through the middle of &quot;Northfield&quot;. Damaged beyond repair, &quot;Northfield II&quot; sank within ten minutes, ending up near the modern South Street Seaport. Out of 995 passengers aboard, only four or five were killed. The dead were not recovered for several days, and one man&#x27;s body drifted around the southern tip of Manhattan and across the Hudson River. An investigation into the crash found that &quot;Northfield II&quot; had sunk because of the extent of the damage rather than because of its 38-year age. Despite this, neither captain was criminally charged, although &quot;Mauch Chunk&quot; captain was &quot;censured&quot; for speeding as well as for not helping the passengers aboard &quot;Northfield&quot;. In the meantime, the B&amp;O borrowed the paddle-wheeler &quot;John Englis&quot; from the Williamsburg Ferry Company.

On February 21, 1902, two hundred people held discussions with MacDougal Hawkes, the head of the New York City Department of Docks, to demand that the Whitehall-to-St. George ferry service be improved. In summer 1902, as the B&amp;O fought to retain its ownership of the ferry, Henry Huttleston Rogers demonstrated that his steam-powered yacht was faster than the SIR&#x27;s vessels, and argued that he should thus be allowed to operate the ferry route. Throughout the rest of the year, Rogers&#x27;s Standard Oil-affiliated transit venture, which also operated streetcar routes on Staten Island, competed with the B&amp;O for the rights to the ferry. The locations of the Staten Island terminal were also debated; and West Brighton, Tompkinsville, Stapleton, and Port Richmond were suggested as possible locations. The B&amp;O wanted to offer service to St. George and at least one other terminal, while Rogers wanted to use only the Tompkinsville and West Brighton terminals. The two groups submitted their proposals in November 1902; and by February 1903, the Sinking Fund Commission announced their decision to give B&amp;O the operating license. This decision proved controversial: Hawkes made a recommendation to Mayor Seth Low on February 21, and dissatisfied Staten Islanders showed up to the commission&#x27;s meeting on February 25. These residents, voicing their dissent, helped cause the commissioners to reject Hawkes&#x27;s proposal.

Shortly after, the government of New York City announced its intent to acquire ownership of the ferry. Instead of offering the franchise to either the B&amp;O or Rogers, the Sinking Fund Commission decided, in March 1903, that the city could run two ferry routes from Staten Island. One route would travel to Manhattan, terminating at any North River port between 23rd Street and Battery Park, while the other route would go from Staten Island to 39th Street, near Bush Terminal, in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The bill authorizing the city to acquire ferry operations was passed by the 126th New York State Legislature, and it was signed into law by Governor Benjamin B. Odell in May 1903. The city would pay $3.2 million to take over operations of the ferry, including $2 million for five new screw-propelled ships, one named for each of the five boroughs. The city began soliciting tenders for ferryboats, ultimately deciding to pay $1.7 million for four of the five boats from the Maryland Steel Company. The contract was signed on June 20, 1904. The fifth boat, &quot;Richmond&quot;, was built on Staten Island by the Burlee Dry Dock Company.

From 1902 to 1903, there were debates on where to put the new Whitehall terminal; and Whitehall Street was decided on as the best location. In 1904, after the Staten Island Railway Company refused the city&#x27;s offer of $500,000 for the two terminals, the city started a process to condemn the land around the terminals. Although the B&amp;O had been set to give up the Staten Island Ferry franchise in early 1904, the new borough-class ferryboats were not ready by that time. So, the B&amp;O was granted a two-year contract extension, on the condition that the contract could be canceled with 30 days&#x27; notice. In return, the city could purchase the B&amp;O&#x27;s ownership share in the terminals and the five existing ships from B&amp;O, namely &quot;Westfield II&quot;, &quot;Middletown&quot;, &quot;Southfield II&quot;, &quot;Robert Garrett&quot;, and &quot;Castleton&quot;, for a set price. A new St. George Terminal was built by the city for $2,318,720, replacing the existing terminal.

All of the ships except for &quot;Richmond&quot; were finished by April 1905 and delivered during the late summer and early fall of that year. &quot;Richmond&quot; was ready by May 20; and as it had been built in Port Richmond, there was no need to transport the boat. On October 25, 1905, the Department of Docks and Ferries assumed ownership of the ferry and terminals; and the borough ferryboats started their maiden voyages. The next year, the city took ownership of the five B&amp;O ships.

=== City ownership and ferries to other destinations ===

==== 1900s and 1910s ====
The ferry service from St. George to 39th Street in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, became city-operated on November 1, 1906, as provided for by the 1903 law transferring ownership of that route to the city. Its Brooklyn terminus was located near the Brooklyn, Bath and West End Railroad&#x27;s former 39th Street terminal, but as that railroad had been converted into the West End subway line, the Brooklyn ferry now primarily served industrial interests in Sunset Park. Mayor George McClellan, elected as Low&#x27;s successor in 1903, and Docks Commissioner Maurice Featherson were initially skeptical of the acquisition; but despite their objections, the Sinking Funds Commission approved the private line&#x27;s acquisition in 1905. The route started with three ferryboats from the Union Ferry Company of Brooklyn. Three new boats were then commissioned for the 39th Street route. Named &quot;Gowanus&quot;, &quot;Bay Ridge&quot;, and &quot;Nassau&quot;, they were smaller than the borough-class boats. &quot;Bay Ridge&quot; was the first to arrive, in July 1907, followed by &quot;Gowanus&quot; in August, and &quot;Bay Ridge&quot; in September. A second route from St. George to Brooklyn started operating on July 4, 1912. The privately operated Brooklyn &amp; Richmond Ferry Company operated the service to 69th Street in Bay Ridge.

New York City started operating a line from Battery Park to Stapleton in May 1909. This service ran every 90 minutes between 4 a.m. and 8 p.m. daily. It was discontinued at the end of 1913, due to low ridership. Staten Islanders protested against the city&#x27;s discontinuance of the Stapleton ferry, to no avail.

Mayor McClellan&#x27;s successor, William Jay Gaynor, was opposed to what he saw as a hasty purchase of the 39th Street line. Upon becoming mayor in 1910, Gaynor communicated to his administration&#x27;s docks commissioner, Calvin Tompkins, that the operating costs of that route needed to be reduced; in response, Tompkins replaced the superintendent of ferries. Neither of the city&#x27;s Staten Island ferries showed a profit until 1915, under John Purroy Mitchel&#x27;s mayoral administration. The city&#x27;s purchase of the two Staten Island ferry routes was intended to be temporary, until private operators could be found, but it never happened. These were the only two routes the city operated at the time, but the city continued to award privately operated ferry franchises elsewhere.

The ferryboat &quot;Mayor Gaynor&quot; was delivered in 1914, during Mitchel&#x27;s administration, to boost service on the Whitehall route, although it had originally been intended for the Sunset Park route. It was not as efficient as the borough-class boats (see ), so it was relegated to supplementary service. Another vessel in the fleet, &quot;Castleton&quot;, was sold to a private owner in 1915; its classmate, &quot;Robert Garrett&quot; (renamed &quot;Stapleton&quot; in 1906) would remain in city ownership until 1922.

==== 1920s to early 1940s ====
Mayor Mitchel&#x27;s successor, John Francis Hylan, commissioned a series of new boats after he was elected in 1917. &quot;President Roosevelt&quot; (also known as &quot;T.R.&quot;) was delivered in 1921, and &quot;American Legion&quot; was delivered five years later. The names of both boats triggered some controversy—&quot;President Roosevelt&quot; due to resentment of Theodore Roosevelt, and &quot;American Legion&quot; due to the fact that it was named after the American Legion, which was only one of the various veterans&#x27; organizations in existence. At the same time, Hylan also ordered three more boats for the 39th Street route, and he ordered 11 boats for other city-operated routes. This brought the number of boats ordered by Hylan&#x27;s administration to 16. After Hylan&#x27;s electoral defeat by Jimmy Walker in 1925, &quot;George W. Loft&quot; and &quot;William Randolph Hearst&quot; were respectively renamed to &quot;West Brighton&quot; and &quot;Whitehall II&quot;. In April 1926, the white paint scheme of the boats was replaced by a maroon scheme, which was better at hiding the accumulations of grime on the boats&#x27; exteriors.

In March 1924, New York City Plant and Structures Commissioner Grover A. Whalen suggested that the infrequent 69th Street service be placed under city administration, a request that ultimately went unfulfilled, as the Brooklyn &amp; Richmond Ferry would continue to operate the route until 1939. However, in June 1924, the route to 39th Street was taken over by New York Bay Ferry. By the end of that summer, the three ferry routes were advertised as the most convenient way to get to Staten Island until a tunnel between Staten Island and Brooklyn could be completed, although the tunnel never was finished because its construction was halted a year later. In the 1930s, the ferry routes to Whitehall Street and 39th Street each received one class of three new boats. The boats in the &quot;Dongan Hills&quot; class were delivered from 1929 to 1931 for the 39th Street route, and the boats in the &quot;Mary Murray&quot; class were delivered from 1937 to 1938 for the Whitehall Street route. The classes&#x27; engines and dimensions were similar, but each class&#x27;s exterior appearance was very different from the other.

The Brooklyn &amp; Richmond Ferry Company found it increasingly difficult to maintain its aging fleet, especially with the competition from the 39th Street ferry&#x27;s new, problem-free ferryboats. This resulted in infrequent service on the Bay Ridge ferry to 69th Street, which lead to a decline in patronage and fare revenues. In February 1939, the United States Department of Commerce ordered the Brooklyn &amp; Richmond Ferry Company to cease all operations after finding that one of its 40-year-old boats was in a severely deteriorated condition. The Bay Ridge operation was subsequently taken over by the Electric Ferries company on March 1, 1939. Electric Ferries, which also operated other routes in the area, bought three secondhand ferryboats from other companies to supplement seven new boats. In 1940, the Brooklyn &amp; Richmond Ferry Company asked the city to stop its municipal operation to 39th Street, so the 69th Street ferry could carry all Staten Island-to-Brooklyn traffic, thus enabling them to lower rates. The city refused.

==== Mid-1940s and 1950s ====
After the end of World War II in 1945, the city wanted to reconstruct St. George Terminal, which would in turn improve ferry service to Whitehall Street. On June 25, 1946, a fire occurred at St. George, killing three people and destroying the slips for the Whitehall ferry route. The only ferry slips that had not been damaged in the fire were those used by the 39th Street ferry. Because the Whitehall route had more ridership, the 39th Street ferry service was suspended so that Whitehall ferries could stop at St. George. The suspension of ferry service was supposed to be temporary; but when service was still suspended after a year had elapsed, merchants at Brooklyn&#x27;s Bush Terminal, near 39th Street, began petitioning the city to resume service. However, this service was apparently never resumed. The new terminal was completed in June 1951.

From 1950 to 1951, the city ordered the construction of three new &quot;Merrell&quot;-class boats for the Whitehall Street route. These boats differed significantly from their predecessors in that they used 6-cylinder &quot;Unaflow&quot; engines, which allowed for a more efficient steam-powered ferryboat compared to the two 2-cylinder compound steam engines of earlier models. With the lowest bid for the three boats coming in at $6.44 million, the &quot;Merrell&quot; class was more expensive than the &quot;Mary Murray&quot; class before it, which had cost only $1 million a boat. The &quot;Merrell&quot; class would quickly become outdated with the introduction of a subsequent class whose diesel engines were even more powerful.

Around this time, ferry services in the area were being discontinued and replaced by bridges and tunnels, leading to the eventual demise of the 69th Street ferry. The exception was the direct ferry from Manhattan to Staten Island, which was not expected to see a significant decrease in ridership because it provided the only direct link between the two boroughs. Electric Ferries&#x27; franchise for the Bay Ridge ferry expired on March 31, 1954; and the city contracted the 69th Street ferry&#x27;s operation to Henry Shanks in order to keep that ferry running. The 69th Street ferry ceased operation in 1964, due to the opening of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge a short distance south of its route. At the time of the 69th Street ferry&#x27;s discontinuation, it was being used by 7,000 passengers daily, who paid five cents each, and 8,000 vehicles daily, which were charged 75 cents apiece. Each boat could fit between 500 and 750 passengers but only 42 vehicles, which meant for traffic jams at both of the ferry&#x27;s slips, due to the boats&#x27; low capacity. However, the route between St. George and Whitehall was kept open, since the bridge&#x27;s opening was expected to spur an influx of residents to Staten Island, with a potential increase in commute ridership on the ferry to Manhattan.

=== Reduction to a single ferry line ===

==== 1960s to 1990s ====
By 1967, all other ferries in New York City had closed due to competition from automobile traffic, and the St. George-to-Whitehall route was the only ferry in the city. It remained as such until the 1980s, when other ferry routes were restarted. Off-peak service was reduced in 1967, but two months later that service was restored. However, due to the mid-1970s New York City fiscal crisis, night service ended on July 1, 1975, with alternate service being provided by the Fourth Avenue subway. Night service was restored in the 1980s after two boats, comprising the current &quot;Austen&quot; class, were ordered specifically for off-peak and night voyages. These boats entered service in 1986.

By the late 1980s, ferries had again become a popular mode of transport in the area. In 1991, seventy companies expressed interest in bidding for the rights to operate new ferries across the city. This list of potential bidders was reduced to three companies by 1993. One of these ferries was to be a ferry from Staten Island to midtown Manhattan; this new ferry would travel at top speeds of , as opposed to the existing Whitehall-to-St. George ferry&#x27;s . New York Fast Ferry was ultimately selected to run a ferry from St. George to East 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan; it opened in January 1997 and saw about 1,650 commuters a day.

The Midtown ferry proved successful until the city essentially eliminated the competing Whitehall Street route&#x27;s fare in July 1997, as part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)&#x27;s &quot;one-city, one-fare&quot; transfer scheme: Staten Island transit riders could pay a single $1.50 fare with a MetroCard on a Staten Island bus or train and get a free transfer to a Manhattan bus or subway by taking the St. George–Whitehall ferry at no additional cost, with return trips handled similarly. As a result, daily ridership on the $5-per-ticket Midtown ferry decreased to 400 passengers, and New York Fast Ferry was unable to make a profit on the route. New York Fast Ferry went out of business at the end of 1997, at which point NY Waterway took over the route. NY Waterway also failed to break even on the Midtown route, and it was eliminated on July 31, 1998. Despite requests from local officials to restore the ferry service, a route from Staten Island to Midtown Manhattan did not run again until August 23, 2021, when NYC Ferry&#x27;s St. George route began operations.

==== 2000s to present ====
Immediately after the September 11, 2001, attacks, Staten Island ferryboats were used to evacuate attack victims from the World Trade Center. The line was then temporarily closed for a week, with ferry service restored by September 18. When it reopened, some ferries were diverted to Bay Ridge due to the closures of subways and roads across the East River. This continued into 2002, by which time some 2,200 passengers per day were using the ferry, and continued to do so even after the subways and highways were reopened. As a result of the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, all vehicular traffic on the ferry was banned in 2003, and passengers were no longer allowed to board from the lower level of either terminal. Passengers had to board and depart from different sections of the ferry; each terminal&#x27;s lower level was used by departing passengers, which required boarding passengers to use the upper level. This made boarding the ferry inconvenient for park-and-ride users at the St. George Terminal.

In 2002, the city again proposed eliminating night service, with plans to outsource nighttime operations to other ferry companies in the area. However, night and weekend service was increased in 2004 due to growing ridership. Before the 2004 increase in night service, boats only ran once an hour between midnight and 7 a.m. The ferry had not added more trips during nights and weekends, even though Staten Island&#x27;s population had increased since 1990. Ridership continued to increase; and in November 2006, additional ferries, running every 30 minutes, were provided during the weekend morning hours. In 2015, weekend-morning and late-night frequencies were increased to every thirty minutes.

The lower levels of each terminal were reopened in 2017 to reduce crowding on the ships&#x27; upper levels. The St. George Terminal&#x27;s lower level was opened during the morning rush, and the Whitehall Terminal&#x27;s lower level was opened during middays and the evening rush. During March 2020, service frequencies were temporarily decreased to once-hourly service due to an 86% decrease in ridership levels following the spread of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic to New York City. During the pandemic, concession stands aboard each vessel were closed. A longer-term nighttime service cut was announced the next month; the service reduction would remain in effect through at least June 2021, saving $6 million. Full-time service was restored in August 2021. The New York City Department of Transportation and the New York City Economic Development Corporation announced plans in January 2024 to reopen the concession stands on each ferryboat, and they began looking for concessionaires that month.

== Operations ==
The Staten Island Ferry operates 24/7. A new ferry trip begins every 30 minutes most hours of the day and night, with more frequent service during peak times, and takes 25 minutes to complete the route. The ferry carried 23.9 million passengers in fiscal year 2016. The Staten Island Ferry is administered separately from NYC Ferry.

The ferry to Staten Island departs Manhattan from the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal at South Ferry, at the southernmost tip of Manhattan near the Battery, and follows a single route. On Staten Island, ferryboats to Manhattan depart from the St. George Ferry Terminal on Richmond Terrace, near Richmond County&#x27;s Borough Hall and Supreme Court.

The ferry ride affords views of the Downtown Jersey City skyline, the Lower Manhattan skyline, Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island, Ellis Island, Governors Island and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. As such it is a popular destination on Saturday nights. The backdrop of the Staten Island Ferry&#x27;s route also makes it a popular place for film shoots, and the ferry has been featured in various films, such as &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988), &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; (2003), and &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017). Many other films and TV episodes use the Staten Island Ferry in establishing shots.
In the past, ferries were equipped for vehicle transport, and operators charged $3 per automobile. A vehicle ban was approved in 1992, after the Whitehall Terminal was destroyed and subsequently rebuilt without vehicle loading areas. Although the temporary terminals included car loading areas, car boarding was discontinued after the September 11 attacks. A plan to reinstate car boarding, because of rising tolls on the Verrazzano Bridge, was seen as infeasible due to the effort needed to screen every car.

While the ferries no longer transport motor vehicles, they do transport bicycles. There is a bicycle entrance to the ferry at both terminals on the ground level so bicyclists can enter the ferry without needing to enter the building. The ground entrance was reserved exclusively for bicyclists until September 2017, when lower-level boarding and disembarking was restored for all passengers. Cyclists are subject to screening upon arrival at the ferry terminals and must dismount and walk their bicycles to the waiting area and onto the boat. Bicycles must be stored in the designated bicycle storage area on each boat.

During rush hours, ferries usually depart every 15 to 20 minutes, with frequency decreasing to every 30 minutes during the mid-days and evenings. Ferries run at 30-minute intervals for a few hours during the early morning—usually 12 a.m. to 6 a.m.—and on weekends.

=== Terminals ===

==== Whitehall Terminal ====

There have been at least two terminals on the site of the current Whitehall Terminal. When the original terminal opened in 1903, its Beaux-Arts design was identical to the Battery Maritime Building, which still exists. In 1919, a fire at the South Ferry elevated station damaged the building. A $3 million renovation of the terminal was announced in 1953, and it opened on July 24, 1956. The old terminal burned down in a fire on September 8, 1991. A new design was announced the next year, and a temporary terminal was opened at the site to accommodate passengers in the meantime.

On February 7, 2005, a completely renovated and modernized terminal, designed by architect Frederic Schwartz, was dedicated, along with the new two-acre Peter Minuit Plaza in the Battery. The terminal contains connections to the New York City Subway&#x27;s South Ferry/Whitehall Street station complex, as well as to buses and taxis.

==== St. George Terminal ====

A new ferry and rail terminal at St. George&#x27;s Landing and an extension of the Staten Island Railway north from Vanderbilt&#x27;s Landing had been proposed in the 1870s by the owners of the railroad (George Law, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and Erastus Wiman) to replace the various ferry sites on the north and east shores of Staten Island. St. George was selected due to its being the point where Staten Island is closest to Manhattan, approximately away. The terminal and local neighborhood were renamed &quot;St. George&quot; in honor of Law, allegedly as a concession by Wiman in order to build the terminal and connecting tunnel on land owned by Law. The ferry terminal was opened in early 1886.

On June 25, 1946, a large fire destroyed both the wooden ferry and rail terminals, killing three people, and injuring more than 200. Full service was restored in July of that year. A new $21-million facility was built by the city, and opened on June 8, 1951. Plans for a renovation of the terminal were announced in March 1997, and the terminal was renovated in the 2000s, as part of a $300 million renovation of several ferry terminals in the area, including the Whitehall Terminal. , St. George&#x27;s direct rail-sea connection is one of a few left in the United States.

=== Fares ===
There is no charge to take the ferry. However, riders who want to make a round trip must disembark at each terminal and reenter through the terminal building to comply with Coast Guard regulations regarding vessel capacity. The turnstiles were dismantled when fares were discontinued in 1997; the passenger counts can be approximated if the crew of each boat estimates the number of passengers aboard the vessel. The state&#x27;s per-passenger subsidy in 2012 was $4.86, paid for through taxes. This subsidy rose to $5.87 in 2016, before dropping to $5.16 in 2017. By comparison, the city&#x27;s per-passenger subsidy for NYC Ferry, in 2017, was $6.50, after accounting for the $2.75 per-passenger fare.

For most of the 19th and 20th centuries, the ferry was famed as the biggest bargain in New York City, as it charged the same one-nickel, or five-cent, fare as the New York City Subway. In 1882, riders protested against a proposed fare increase to 10 cents per ride, but were unsuccessful in obtaining a fare reduction. The fare-reduction movement resurfaced in 1894, with multiple petitions being submitted to the New-York Sinking Fund Commissioners. However, these petitions were all denied. By 1898, the fare had been reduced back to a nickel.

The fare for the ferry remained a nickel when the subway fare was increased to 10 cents in 1948. Despite the ferry&#x27;s growing operational shortfalls in the 1950s, the five-cent fare remained, regardless of inflation. By 1968, the Citizens Budget Commission was proposing to hike fares to close the subsidy deficit, with Staten Island commuters to pay 20 cents, and others 50 cents, for a one-way trip. In May 1970, then-Mayor John V. Lindsay proposed that the fare be raised to 25 cents, pointing out that the cost for each ride was 50 cents, or ten times what the fare was bringing in. As part of a city budget passed in June of that year, the nickel fare was kept. Due to the city&#x27;s financial crisis in the mid-1970s, Mayor Abraham Beame submitted a proposal to increase the fare in July 1975. On August 4, 1975, the fare was increased to 25 cents for a round trip, collected in one direction only. The fare increase was intended to earn the ferry service an extra $1.35 million in annual revenue.

In 1990, the charge for a round trip was increased to 50 cents, provoking a backlash among Staten Islanders, and sparking calls for its complete abolition. In 1993, grievances over the fare partly contributed to Staten Island&#x27;s passing a non-binding referendum to secede from New York City. Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s three-percent margin of victory in the concurrent mayoral elections was in considerable part due to the support of 80% of Staten Island voters, whose concerns he had pledged to address. The passenger fare was subsequently eliminated altogether, in July 1997, as part of the implementation of the MTA&#x27;s &quot;one-city, one-fare&quot; system, which allowed for more free transfers between different modes of transit in New York City. The $3 car fares were not affected, as they were separate. The new MetroCard was configured to allow one free transfer between buses and subways; if the rider had paid a fare less than two hours prior, a ferry trip would be regarded as part of that transfer. Eliminating the ferry fare was seen as an action to standardize Staten Islanders&#x27; MetroCard fares with those of commuters in other boroughs. Despite the fact that the ferry fare had netted $6 million in annual revenue for the city, its abolition only cost the city about $1 million. The other $5 million represented the money saved not having to maintain the now-removed turnstiles, as well as the revenue from MetroCard fares. Some riders disliked the fares&#x27; discontinuance, as they felt that free service might mean lower-quality service.

In 2014, the city&#x27;s Independent Budget Office conducted a study investigating the viability of collecting fares from everyone except Staten Island residents. The study found that, after accounting for the expenses of implementing the fare system, a $4 fare would generate net revenue of $35.5 million over fifteen years, while a $2 fare would generate net revenue of only $804,000 during the same time. About 4 million passengers would be subject to the fare annually, based on the previous year&#x27;s ridership figure of 21.9 million.

=== Ridership ===
Detailed ridership figures for many fiscal years are not widely available because, in many cases, they not have been publicly released. A 1958 &quot;New York Times&quot; article cited a figure of 24 million annual riders. Ridership on the ferry peaked in 1964, with 27.5 million passengers, but the figure dropped to 22 million in 1965, after the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge opened. In the early 2000s, ridership mostly fluctuated between 18 and 19 million, rising to 21.8 million in 2006 before dropping to 18.5 million the next year. Afterward, ridership started rising again, reaching over 21 million in fiscal year 2011.

In fiscal 2012, the ferry carried 22.18 million passengers, the highest figure in several decades. The figure in fiscal 2013 declined slightly to 21.4 million. Ridership for fiscal 2014 declined again to 21.25 million, while ridership on private ferry services increased. Public ridership then began rising in subsequent years, especially after the 2015 increase in trip frequency, when ridership reached 21.9 million. In fiscal 2016, ridership on the ferry increased to 23.1 million passengers; and in fiscal 2017, ridership increased further, to 23.9 million passengers, breaking the previous year&#x27;s record. Ridership in fiscal year 2018 rose again to 24.5 million passengers, and in fiscal year 2019, increased to 25.2 million passengers. Ridership dropped significantly in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By fiscal 2023, ridership had partially recovered to 14.7 million, though the route still had substantially fewer passengers than before the pandemic. In calendar year , the ferry had riders.

, the Staten Island Ferry is the single busiest ferry route, and one of the busiest ferry systems, in the United States, as well as the world&#x27;s busiest passenger-only ferry. Despite having only a single route, it carried 23.1 million passengers in fiscal 2016 (the multiple-route Washington State Ferries, the largest U.S. ferry operator with the largest fleet, carried 24.2 million passengers in 2016).


== Fleet ==
=== Current ===
There are ten ferry boats in service, from four classes—&quot;Barberi&quot;, &quot;Austen&quot;, &quot;Molinari&quot;, and &quot;Ollis&quot;.

==== &quot;Barberi&quot; class ====
The &quot;&quot;Barberi&quot; class&quot; consists of and MV &quot;Samuel I. Newhouse&quot;, which were built in 1981 and 1982, respectively. Each boat has a crew of 15 and can carry 6,000 passengers but no cars. Each &quot;Barberi&quot;-class vessel is long and wide, with a draft of , a weight of 3,335 gross tons, a service speed of , and engines capable of 8,000 horsepower (6.0 MW). These ships were built at the Equitable Shipyard in New Orleans, at a cost of $16.5 million each. At the time of construction, the ships&#x27; capacity was the largest of any licensed ferry in the world.

&quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; was named after the man who coached Curtis High School&#x27;s football team from the 1950s through the 1970s, while &quot;Samuel I. Newhouse&quot; was named after Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr., the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot;″s publisher from 1922 to 1979.

==== &quot;Austen&quot; class ====
The &quot;&quot;Austen&quot; class&quot; consists of MV &quot;Alice Austen&quot; and MV &quot;John A. Noble&quot;, which were built in 1986 and are commonly referred to as &quot;the Little Boats&quot; or &quot;Mini Barberis&quot;. Each boat has a crew of nine, carries 1,280 passengers but not cars, is long and wide, with a draft of , of 499 gross tons, with a service speed of , and engines capable of 3,200 horsepower (2.4 MW). Their namesakes are Alice Austen (1866–1952), a Staten Island photographer, and John A. Noble (1913–83), a Staten Island marine artist.

&quot;Austen&quot;-class vessels usually operate late at night and into the early morning, when ridership is lower. Plans call for either the &quot;Alice Austen&quot; or the &quot;John A. Noble&quot; to be converted from using low-sulfur diesel as fuel to liquefied natural gas (LNG), in an effort to halve fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent.

==== &quot;Molinari&quot; class ====
The &quot;&quot;Molinari&quot; class&quot; consists of MV &quot;Guy V. Molinari&quot;, MV &quot;Sen. John J. Marchi&quot;, and MV &quot;Spirit of America&quot;. Each boat has a crew of 16, carries a maximum of 4,427 passengers and up to 30 vehicles, is long by wide, with a draft of , of 2,794 gross tons, with a service speed of , and engines capable of 9,000 horsepower (6.7 MW). Built by the Marinette Marine Group in Marinette, Wisconsin, they are designed to have a look and ambiance reminiscent of the classic New York ferryboats.

The lead boat is named after Guy V. Molinari, a former U.S. Representative for several Staten Island districts, who later became a borough president of Staten Island. It was delivered in September 2004. The second ferry was named for State Senator John Marchi, who represented Staten Island for fifty years and delivered January 5, 2005. The third ferry, &quot;Spirit of America&quot;, was delivered September 16, 2005 and scheduled to be put into service on October 25, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the municipal takeover of the Staten Island Ferry from the B&amp;O railroad. Mechanical problems on the &quot;Molinari&quot;-class ferries and legal proceedings kept &quot;Spirit of America&quot; sidelined at the Staten Island Ferry&#x27;s St. George maintenance facility until its maiden voyage on April 4, 2006. Since delivery, the ferries have been beset by frequent breakdowns, with 58 such incidents from 2008 to 2014; almost half of these breakdowns have been on &quot;Guy V. Molinari&quot;.

==== &quot;Ollis&quot; class ====

The &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, &quot;Samuel I. Newhouse&quot;, and &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; are being replaced by three new vessels: &quot;SSG Michael H. Ollis&quot;, &quot;Sandy Ground&quot;, and &quot;Dorothy Day&quot;. They are named the , after US Army Staff Sgt. Michael Ollis of Staten Island, who was killed in action during the War in Afghanistan. Elliott Bay Design devised the plans for the new ferries. In November 2016, Eastern Shipbuilding was confirmed as the low bidder for constructing the ships, and the shipyard was awarded the contract, with a notice to proceed being received on March 1, 2017. Delivery of the new ships was originally planned for 2019 and 2020. Deliveries were delayed after Eastern Shipbuilding&#x27;s shipyard in Panama City, Florida, was severely damaged by Hurricane Michael in October 2018, and again in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The first of the fleet, MV &quot;SSG Michael H. Ollis&quot;, entered service on February 14, 2022. This was followed by MV &quot;Sandy Ground&quot;, which entered service on June 17, 2022. The final ferry, MV &quot;Dorothy Day&quot; entered service on April 28, 2023.

=== Former ===
==== Fleet acquired 1905–1931 ====
Several ferry classes, purchased since the city assumed ownership of the ferry, have been retired. The ferries named after the five boroughs, &quot;Bronx&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Queens&quot;, and &quot;Richmond&quot;, were the first ones commissioned for the city line in 1905. All of the boats except &quot;Richmond&quot; were long and wide, with a draft of and a gross tonnage of 1,954. &quot;Richmond&quot; had the same width and draft as its classmates, but was long with a gross tonnage of 2,006. All of the borough-class boats were retired in the 1940s. &quot;Manhattan&quot; was out of documentation by 1941, when &quot;Bronx&quot; was the first of the remaining boats to be scrapped. The three remaining ferries were scrapped by 1947, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; having served as a floating school for the United States Coast Guard in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, beginning in 1943, and &quot;Richmond&quot; having been converted to a barge in 1944.

The city&#x27;s next class, delivered two years after the borough-class boats, consisted of &quot;Gowanus&quot;, &quot;Bay Ridge&quot;, and &quot;Nassau&quot;, which were used for the Brooklyn line. Each boat was long and wide, with a draft of and a gross tonnage of 862. These boats were all sold by 1940. &quot;Bay Ridge&quot; was used as the barge &quot;Rappahannock River&quot;, while the other two were scrapped.

The third class consisted of &quot;Mayor Gaynor&quot; (1914), followed by &quot;President Roosevelt&quot; (1922) and the first &quot;American Legion&quot; (1926). Each boat of this class differed in dimensions and gross tonnage from its classmates. &quot;Mayor Gaynor&quot; had a different engine and vastly different dimensions than its other two classmates, so it is sometimes considered as in a different class. &quot;Mayor Gaynor&quot; 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine was not as efficient as the 2-cylinder compression engines of the previous borough-class boats, so the two vessels following it reverted to the more reliable engine type used in the borough-class. Additionally, &quot;Mayor Gaynor&quot; was long and wide, with a draft of and a gross tonnage of 1,634. The other two boats were approximately long by wide, and had a draft of and a gross tonnage of 2,029 (for &quot;President Roosevelt&quot;) or 2,089 (for &quot;American Legion&quot;). &quot;Mayor Gaynor&quot; was the first to be dismantled, in 1951, while &quot;President Roosevelt&quot; and &quot;American Legion&quot; were scrapped in 1956 and 1963, respectively.

In 1923, the steam turbine-powered ferryboats &quot;William Randolph Hearst&quot;, &quot;Rodman Wanamaker&quot;, and &quot;George W. Loft&quot; were built. The names of the boats, which were all derived from those of prominent New York City businessmen, were kept secret until the vessels were unveiled. All of these boats had a length of , a width of , a draft of , and a gross tonnage of 875. &quot;George W. Loft&quot; shared her name with another boat used up the Hudson River, and so the other boat had to be renamed. Used mostly on the 39th Street route, these boats went into service in June 1924 and were out of documentation by 1954.

A subsequent class, delivered from 1929 through 1931, consisted of &quot;Dongan Hills&quot;, &quot;Tompkinsville&quot;, and &quot;Knickerbocker&quot;, in order of delivery. The first two boats had the same dimensions as &quot;President Roosevelt&quot;, while &quot;Knickerbocker&quot; was one foot longer and one foot wider, with a gross tonnage of 2,045. &quot;Tompkinsville&quot; and &quot;Dongan Hills&quot; went out of documentation in 1967–1968, while &quot;Knickerbocker&quot; was sold for scrap in 1965.

==== Fleet acquired after 1931 ====
The &quot;Miss New York&quot; class—consisting of &quot;Miss New York&quot;, &quot;Gold Star Mother&quot;, and &quot;Mary Murray&quot;—was delivered in 1938. They had the same width, length, and draft as &quot;Knickerbocker&quot;, with a gross tonnage of 2,126. &quot;Gold Star Mother&quot; was decommissioned in 1969, to save money, before being auctioned off in 1974. &quot;Gold Star Mother&quot; sister &quot;Mary Murray&quot; was retired in 1974 and sold at auction. From 1982 through the mid-2000s, it then sat as a floating wreck on the Raritan River, within view of the New Jersey Turnpike, and was partially broken up for scrap in 2008. The third sister ship, &quot;Miss New York&quot;, was decommissioned in 1975 and auctioned. &quot;Miss New York&quot; was used as a restaurant for a while, but then sank.

The sixth class of ferryboats—&quot;Cornelius G. Kolff&quot;, &quot;Pvt. Joseph F. Merrell&quot;, and &quot;Verrazzano&quot;—went into service in 1951. These boats were slightly larger than their predecessors, with a length of , a width of , a draft of , and a gross tonnage of 2,285. They were built at the Bethlehem Staten Island shipyard on Staten Island. &quot;Verrazzano&quot; was decommissioned and sold at auction in the 1980s. The new owners proposed to use the old ferry at a Japanese amusement park. That deal fell through, and it became a floating wreck at the Red Hook Container Terminal. Its two classmates, &quot;Kolff&quot; (later &quot;Walter Keane&quot;) and &quot;Merrell&quot; (later &quot;Vernon C. Bain&quot;, then &quot;Harold A. Wildstein)&quot; were shipped to Rikers Island in 1987 to help alleviate prison overcrowding there, to be used as an interim housing solution while new jail facilities were being built. &quot;Keane&quot; and &quot;Wildstein&quot;, along with the retired British troop carriers &quot;Bibby Resolution&quot; and &quot;Bibby Venture&quot;, were used to house 1,000 inmates. The vessels were removed from prison use in 1997, after the Vernon C. Bain floating barge was built; and both vessels were scrapped in 2004.

The &quot;Kennedy&quot; class consists of MV &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, the second MV &quot;American Legion&quot;, and MV &quot;The Gov. Herbert H. Lehman&quot;, which were delivered in 1965. Each boat had a crew of 15, could carry 3,055 passengers and 40 vehicles, is long and wide, with a draft of , of 2,109 gross tons, with a service speed of , and engines capable of 6,500 horsepower (4.8 MW). They were built by the Levingston Shipbuilding Company in Orange, Texas, and were delivered in May and June 1965. Most of the &quot;Kennedy&quot; class has also been scrapped. &quot;American Legion&quot; was retired in 2006 and sold for scrap. Its classmate &quot;The Gov. Herbert H. Lehman&quot; was retired in 2007 and sold at auction by the city in 2011. By 2012, it was being scrapped at Steelways Shipyard in Newburgh, New York, where it sank after developing a leak. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was the last of its class in service; it retired in August 2021 and was sold to Pete Davidson and Colin Jost at a January 2022 auction.

== Incidents ==

=== Early 20th century, after city takeover ===
In November 1910, the ferryboat &quot;Nassau&quot; ran aground on the seawall of Governors Island, but most passengers were able to jump off the boat safely. The boat only suffered minor damage to its propeller.

On October 31, 1921, the ferryboat &quot;Mayor Gaynor&quot; ran aground near Robbins Reef Light, in the middle of the harbor. This was a result of a heavy fog, which slowed shipping and caused a BRT train accident that injured 20 people. On February 24, 1929, the same boat was involved in another crash, when it ran into the Whitehall ferry slip and injured three people. Coincidentally, &quot;Mayor Gaynor&quot; collided with the same spot a year and a day later, injuring seven people.

=== Late 20th century ===
On January 16, 1953, a heavy fog across the East Coast caused four ferry accidents in New York Harbor. In one accident, the &quot;Gold Star&quot; crashed into the United States Lines freighter &quot;American Veteran&quot;, injuring 13 people. In another heavy fog four days later, &quot;Joseph F. Merrill&quot; crashed into an Ellis Island ferryboat, jolting several passengers but injuring no one. Five years later, on February 8, 1958, &quot;Dongan Hills&quot; was hit by the Norwegian tanker &quot;Tynefield&quot;, injuring 15 people. The &quot;Cornelius G. Kolff&quot; collided with a ferry slip at the Whitehall Terminal on June 4, 1959, injuring 14 people.

On October 23, 1960, the &quot;Sunday Bomber&quot; struck, blowing up a supply closet as the ferry passed the Statue of Liberty. No injuries were reported.

On November 7, 1978, &quot;American Legion&quot; crashed into the concrete seawall near the Statue of Liberty ferry port during a dense fog, injuring 173 people on board.

On May 6, 1981, &quot;American Legion&quot; was involved in another crash. At 7:16 am EDT, it was en route from Staten Island to Manhattan with approximately 2,400 passengers aboard, when it was rammed in dense fog by MV &quot;Hoegh Orchid&quot;, a Norwegian freighter inbound from the sea to a berth in Brooklyn. The ferryboat was damaged from below the main deck up to the bridge deck. 71 passengers were treated for injuries, three of whom were hospitalized. The absence of a gyrocompass, which could have supplemented existing radar capabilities in avoiding collisions, was noted in the February 2, 1982, report by the National Transportation Safety Board.

On July 7, 1986, a mentally ill man, Juan Gonzalez, attacked passengers with a sword on &quot;Samuel I. Newhouse&quot;. He killed two and injured nine before being detained and sent to a hospital for psychiatric evaluation.

On April 12, 1995, &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot;, due to a mechanical malfunction, rammed her slip at St. George. The doors on the saloon deck were crushed by the slip&#x27;s adjustable aprons, which a quick-thinking bridgeman lowered to help stop the oncoming ferryboat. Several people were injured. Two years later, on September 19, 1997, the terminal was also the site of an incident involving a vehicle. A car plunged off &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; as she was docking, causing minor injuries to the driver and a deckhand who was knocked overboard.

=== 21st century ===
The new century brought the city&#x27;s deadliest mass-transit incident in 50 years. On October 15, 2003, at 3:21 pm EDT, &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; collided with a pier on the eastern end of the St. George ferry terminal, killing 11 people, seriously injuring many others, and tearing a huge gash in the lowest of the three passenger decks. The incident spurred an investigation into safety practices aboard the ferry and an accident investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&#x27;s&quot; captain at the time of the incident was fired. The ferryboat returned to service in 2004.

The St. George terminal also saw two more minor pier collisions. On July 1, 2009, at 7:09 pm EDT, &quot;Sen. John J. Marchi&quot; lost power and hit a pier at full speed, resulting in 15 minor injuries. The four-year-old boat had a history of electrical problems. On May 8, 2010, at 9:20 am EDT, &quot;Andrew J. Barberi&quot; approached the dock, the reverse thrust failed to respond, and the boat could not slow down. Thirty-seven of the 252 passengers on board were injured. 

Several riders were injured on December 22, 2022, when a fire broke out on the &quot;Sandy Ground&quot; as it was traveling to St. George.

<text>An A-list actor is a major movie star, or one of the most bankable actors in a film industry.

The A-list is part of a larger guide called &quot;The Hot List&quot;, which ranks the bankability of 1,400 movie actors worldwide, and has become an industry-standard guide in Hollywood. American entertainment journalist James Ulmer, the guide&#x27;s creator, has also developed a version including directors, the &quot;Hot List of Directors&quot;. The Ulmer scale categorizes the lists into A+, A, B+, B, C, and D listings. Similarly, in India, there is three-tier strategy, tier-1, tier-2 and tier-3, which are based on the saleability and box office collection capability of a star.

==Popular usage==
In popular usage outside the film industry, an A-list celebrity is any person with an admired or desirable social status. Even socialites with popular press coverage and elite associations have been termed as A-list celebrities. Similarly, less popular persons and current teen idols are referred to as B-list celebrities – and the ones with lesser fame as C-list ones. In 2000, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; interpreted a C-list celebrity as &quot;that guy (or sometimes that girl), the easy-to-remember but hard-to-name character actor&quot;.

The D-list is for someone whose celebrity is so obscure that they are generally only known for appearances as celebrities on panel game shows and reality television. In the late 20th century, D-listers were largely ignored by the news industry; for example, Paul Lynde, by this point in his career best known for being on the daytime game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, went largely unnoticed by the supermarket tabloids, and his homosexuality (which would have drawn attention for bigger celebrities) went largely unreported. Kathy Griffin, an American comedian who became widely known for her frequent appearances on such programs, used the term in a tongue-in-cheek manner for her 2005 TV special &quot;The D-List&quot; and her 2005 TV series &quot;Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List&quot;. The term &quot;D-list&quot; is derived from the lowest rating used for the Ulmer scale. Other successive letters of the alphabet beyond D, as in the terms &quot;E-list&quot; and &quot;Z-list&quot;, are sometimes used for exaggeration or comic effect but effectively have the same meaning as &quot;D-list&quot;.

<text>Shaoxing is a prefecture-level city on the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay in northeastern Zhejiang province, China. Located on the south bank of the Qiantang River estuary, it borders Ningbo to the east, Taizhou to the southeast, Jinhua to the southwest, and Hangzhou to the west. As of the 2020 census, its population was 5,270,977 inhabitants among which, 2,958,643 (Keqiao, Yuecheng and Shangyu urban districts) lived in the built-up (or metro) area of Hangzhou–Shaoxing, with a total of 13,035,326 inhabitants.

Notable residents of Shaoxing include Wang Xizhi, the parents of Zhou Enlai, Lu Xun, and Cai Yuanpei. It is also noted for Shaoxing wine, meigan cai, and stinky tofu, and was featured on &quot;A Bite of China&quot;. Its local variety of Chinese opera sung in the local dialect and known as Yue opera is second in popularity only to Peking opera. In 2010, Shaoxing celebrated the 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the city.

Economically, the city is driven by manufacturing of textiles, electronics, and energy-efficient lighting. Zhejiang has the fifth highest per capita GDP in the nation, with the city itself at 32nd nationally by GDP per capita.

==Etymology==
The city was first named Shaoxing in 1131 A.D. during the Southern Song dynasty. The name comes from the Shaoxing reign period of Emperor Gaozong of Song, and is a poetic term meaning &quot;inheriting the imperial task and resurging to prosperity&quot;.

==History==

=== Early history ===

Modern-day Shaoxing lies north of the Kuaiji Mountains, which were an important center of the people of Yue during ancient China&#x27;s Spring and Autumn period. Chinese legend connected them with events in the life of Yu the Great, the founder of the Xia. Around the early 5th century BC, the time of Yue&#x27;s famous king Goujian, his people began establishing permanent centers in the alluvial plain north of the hills. Following his freedom from captivity in Wu, Goujian commissioned his advisor Fan Li to erect a major triangular fortification in the area of present-day Shaoxing&#x27;s Yuecheng District. Following Yue&#x27;s conquest of Wu, though, its royal court was removed to its former rival&#x27;s capital (present-day Suzhou) until its own conquest by Chu in 334 BC.

Following the area&#x27;s conquest in 222 BC, the Qin Empire&#x27;s Kuaiji Commandery was also established in Wu (which then took the name &quot;Kuaiji&quot; from this role) but the First Emperor visited the town in the last year of his reign (210 BC), ascending Mount Kuaiji (present-day Mount Xianglu) and sacrificing to the spirit of Yu. The commemorative stele he erected is now lost but was visited by Sima Qian during his 1st-century BC pilgrimage of China&#x27;s historical sites and was preserved in his &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;. By the time of the Later Han, the lands between the Yangtze and Hangzhou Bay received their own commanderies and administration of Kuaiji—then stretching along the south shore of the bay from Qiantang (present-day Hangzhou) to the East China Sea. The area&#x27;s capital in present-day Yuecheng was then known as Kuaiji until the 12th century, when it was renamed Shaoxing. The present site of Yu&#x27;s mausoleum dates to the 6th-century Southern dynasties period.

=== Ming and Qing dynasties ===
Under the Ming and Qing dynasties, the area was organized as a prefecture containing the following eight counties: urban Kuaiji and Shanyin and rural Yuyao, Zhuji, Xiaoshan, Shangyu, Xinchang, and Cheng (or Sheng). From the later Ming through the Qing, Shaoxing was famous (or notorious) for its network of native sons throughout the Chinese government bureaucracy, cooperating out of native-place loyalty. In addition to the substantial number of Shaoxing natives who succeeded in becoming officials via the regular civil-service examination route, this vertical Shaoxing clique also included county-level jail wardens, plus unofficial legal specialists (muyou) working privately for officials at the county, prefectural, and provincial levels, plus clerks working in Beijing&#x27;s Six Boards (central administrative offices), especially the Boards of Revenue and Punishment. The legal experts were also known as Shaoxing shiye (Shaoxing masters), and they were indispensable advisers to the local and regional officials who employed them, since their knowledge of the detailed Qing legal code permitted the officials, whose education was in the Confucian Classics, to competently perform one of their major functions, that of judging local civil and criminal cases. Coming from the same gentry social class as the officials, the legal experts were expected to adhere to the ethical dictum enunciated by Wang Huizu, Shaoxing&#x27;s most famous muyou: &quot;If not in accord [with your employer], then leave&quot; (&quot;Bu he ze qu&quot;).

During the Taiping Rebellion, Shaoxing was home to a local militia leader named Bao Lisheng who organized an armed resistance to the Taiping army in his home village of Baochun. Bao was a martial arts expert and recruited thousands of people from the surrounding area to his cause by convincing them he had supernatural powers. However, after a months-long siege, Baochun was captured by the Taiping.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
Under the Republic of China during the early 20th century, the prefecture was abolished and the name Shaoxing was applied to a new county comprising the former Shanyin and Kuaiji. Currently, Shaoxing is a municipality with a somewhat smaller land area than its Ming-Qing namesake prefecture, having lost Xiaoshan county to Hangzhou on the west and Yuyao county to Ningbo on the east.

==Climate==
==Administration==
The prefecture-level city of Shaoxing administers three districts, two county-level cities and one county.

The China Shaoxing Yellow Wine Group Corporation produces 110,000 tons annually for domestic and overseas markets. 

==Zhufu folk customs==

Due to its long history, Shaoxing has accumulated and handed down a characteristic culture known as &quot;Yue Culture&quot;. As an important part of Yue Culture and a traditional folk custom of Shaoxing, Zhufu () still has great influence on Shaoxing people and their lives.

===History and background===
Zhufu is also called Zuofu and is the most prominent annual sacrificial ceremony in Shaoxing. The gods worshipped are Nanchao Shengzhong () and Huangshan Xinan (). They have been worshipped since the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368 CE). Legend holds that when the government of the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE) was overthrown by the Mongolian army and replaced by the Yuan dynasty, the original Song citizens, namely the Han people, were extremely afraid of the newly established minority political power. They secretly offered sacrifices at midnight to the emperors of South Song dynasty and those patriotic martyrs who died to save the nation.

Nanchao Shengzhong refers to a group of martyrs, who died in the war of resistance against the Mongolian invasion, including Emperor Huaizong of Song, last emperor of the Southern Song dynasty, Wen Tianxiang, scholar-general of Southern Song dynasty, who was captured but didn&#x27;t give in to the enemy and later was killed by the Yuan Government, and Lu Xiufu, the Southern Song Prime Minister who committed suicide, together with Emperor Huaizong and 800 other officials and members of the imperial court. Huangshan Xinan refers to two anonymous brothers who sacrificed their lives to save civilians from being killed by the Mongolian army. In memory of the brothers, the local people named the place where they were killed after them and offered sacrifice to a portrait or statue of the brothers.

Records show that the Mongolian nobility, the ruling class of the Yuan dynasty, treated the Han people harshly, such that the Han people created and cleverly disguised their gods Nanchao Shengzhong and Huangshan Xinan in order to mourn for the lost nation and its patriotic martyrs whilst praying for their blessing. The ruling class knew only of the ostensible purpose of the annual sacrificial ceremony, believing it was the means to entertain the God of Blessing and pray for a good harvest the next year as well as harmony. The ceremony was handed down from generation to generation and finally became a convention whilst its political meaning gradually dimmed. It became a pure sacrificial ceremony, held annually to offer thanks to the God of Blessing for all his blessings and to pray for the next year&#x27;s blessing.

===Dates===
Zhufu is often held during the period between 24 December and 28 December according to the Chinese lunar calendar. Shaoxing people first choose an auspicious day according to the Chinese lunar calendar to hold the ceremony. In Shaoxing, the days between 20 December and 30 December of the Chinese lunar calendar are called nights instead of days so as to remind homemakers that the Spring Festival is approaching and they should hurry up to prepare for Zhufu and the Spring Festival.

===Ceremonial rite===
Thereafter, the officiant of the ceremony who is usually the man of the house, lights incense and red candles, hangs golden and silver &quot;Taiding&quot; made of paper on the left and right candleholders, puts cushions for kneeling on the ground in order, and inserts a Mazhang Stick, which represents Nanchao Shengzhong or Huangshan Xinan into the prepared holder. Females are not allowed to be present whilst the sacrifice is underway. After tasks are completed, the male members of the family successively kneel down facing the main door and kowtow to the god. At that moment there are many taboos. For example, the wine should not be poured from a cup, and chopsticks should not fall into the ground. Silence is also maintained to avoid taboos.

When all is prepared, the officiant pours wine for those present. They hold their wine cups high as quickly as possible to see the god out. Then the officiant burns the Mazhang Stick together with golden and silver &quot;Taiding&quot; in the courtyard. He cuts the tongues from the chicken and goose then throws them on to the roof of the house at the same time and praying to the god to take away the tongues which symbolize possible calamities emanating from the spoken word. Finally, the officiant put a cup of wine with tea onto the ashes of Mazhang Stick signifying the end of &quot;Zhufu&quot;. Ancestor worship follows the ceremony and, although similar to Zhufu, differences do exist. After worship, the family sits down at tables and eat &quot;Fuli&quot; together, which they call &quot;Sanfu&quot; or sharing the blessings.

As a featured folk custom, Zhufu has been handed down and well protected as part of Shaoxing&#x27;s cultural heritage. It is reputable because of its special origin. It was widely popularized by Lu Xun (1881–1936, Shaoxing-born) in his short story &quot;&quot; (), which he named after the sacrificial ceremony. Whilst deeply moved by the ill-fated leading character of the novel, readers get to learn the details of the &quot;Zhufu&quot; tradition.

<doc id="301264" wikidata="Q189888" url="?curid=301264" title="Marionette">
<text>A marionette ( ; ) is a puppet controlled from above using wires or strings depending on regional variations. A marionette&#x27;s puppeteer is called a marionettist. Marionettes are operated with the puppeteer hidden or revealed to an audience by using a vertical or horizontal control bar in different forms of theatres or entertainment venues. They have also been used in films and on television. The attachment of the strings varies according to its character or purpose.

==Etymology==
In French, means &#x27;little Mary&#x27;. During the Middle Ages, string puppets were often used in France to depict biblical events, with the Virgin Mary being a popular character, hence the name.

In France, the word can refer to any kind of puppet, but elsewhere it typically refers only to string puppets.

==History==
===Antiquity===

Puppetry is an ancient form of performance. Some historians claim that they predate actors in theatre. There is evidence that they were used in Egypt as early as 2000 BC when string-operated figures of wood were manipulated to act kneading bread and other string-controlled objects. Wire-controlled, articulated puppets made of clay and ivory have been found in Egyptian tombs. Marionette puppetry was used to display rituals and ceremonies using these string-operated figurines back in ancient times and is still used today.

Puppetry was practiced in Ancient Greece and the oldest written records of puppetry can be found in the works of Herodotus and Xenophon, dating from the 5th century BC. The Greek word translated as &quot;puppet&quot; is νευρόσπαστος (&quot;nevróspastos&quot;), which literally means &#x27;drawn by strings, string-pulling&#x27;, from νεῦρον (&quot;nevron&quot;), meaning either &#x27;sinew, tendon, muscle, string&#x27;, or &#x27;wire&#x27;, and σπάω (&quot;spáō&quot;), meaning &#x27;draw, pull&#x27;.

Aristotle (384–322 BC) discusses puppets in his work &quot;On the Motion of Animals&quot;:

The movements of animals may be compared with those of automatic puppets, which are set going on the occasion of a tiny movement; the levers are released and strike the twisted strings against one another.

Archimedes is known to have worked with marionettes. Plato&#x27;s work also contains references to puppetry. The &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot; were presented using puppetry. The roots of European puppetry probably extend back to the Greek plays with puppets played to the &quot;common people&quot; in the 5th century BC. By the 3rd century BC these plays would appear in the Theatre of Dionysus at the Acropolis.

In ancient Greece and Rome clay and ivory dolls, dated from around 500 BC, were found in children&#x27;s tombs. These dolls had articulated arms and legs, some of which had an iron rod extending up from the tops of their heads. This rod was used to manipulate the doll from above, exactly as is done today in Sicilian puppetry. A few of these dolls had strings in place of the rods. Some researchers believe these ancient figures were mere toys and not puppets due to their small size.

The Indian word &quot;sutradhara&quot;, from &quot;&quot;, refers to the show-manager of theatrical performances (or a puppet-player), and also means literally &#x27;string-puller&#x27; or &#x27;string-holder&#x27;.

===Sicily===
The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes from the Frankish romantic poems, such as &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;. These same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood, an art form called &quot;l&#x27;opera deî pupi&quot; &#x27;opera of the puppets&#x27; in Sicilian. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of &quot;cantastorî&quot; (singers of tales) are rooted in the Provençal troubadour tradition in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this marionette art is the puppet theatres of Palermo, Sicily.

===Opera===
In the 18th century, operas were specifically composed for marionettes. Mozart as a child had seen marionettes. Gluck, Haydn, de Falla and Respighi all composed adult operas for marionettes. Lewis Carroll composed marionette operas and plays for his siblings&#x27; entertainment. Today in Salzburg in Austria, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre continues the tradition of presenting full-length opera using marionettes in their own theatre.

The &quot;Opera di Pupi&quot;, Sicilian puppet theatre, was relisted on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008.

===Modern theatre===
Marionettes are sometimes referred to as puppets, but the term &quot;marionettes&quot; is more precise, distinguishing them from other forms of puppetry, such as finger, glove, rod, and shadow puppetry.

In the UK the renaissance of Marionettes during the late 19th and early 20th century was driven by Harry Whanslaw and Waldo Lanchester, two of the co-founders of the &quot;British Puppet and Model Theatre Guild&quot;. In 1936 Lanchester and his wife Muriel opened the Lanchester Marionette Theatre in Malvern, Worcestershire, “the only theatre in the country exclusively to be used for marionettes” at the time. The only purpose-built UK marionette theatre is &quot;The Harlequin Puppet Theatre&quot; (built 1958) in Rhos on Sea, North Wales, Founded by Eric Bramall FRSA and continued by Chris Somerville. Other theatres that occasionally perform with marionettes are the Little Angel Theatre founded by John and Lyndie Wright in Islington, London, whose first-ever show &quot;The Wild Night Of The Witches&quot; was a marionette play. It opened the theatre in 1961 and was revived for the 50th anniversary in 2011. The Norwich Puppet Theatre founded by Ray &amp; Joan DaSilva sometimes presents marionette shows and the Puppet Theatre Barge, founded by Gren Middleton and Juliet Rogers, continues to perform using long string marionettes throughout the year. The barge is based in Little Venice, London during the winter months and tours to places such as Richmond Upon Thames during the summer.

In Scotland, Dr Malcolm Knight has championed the art form and over the last 25 years, the Scottish Mask and Puppet Centre has acted as a catalyst, a lead agency, and as a resource centre for all those with an interest in mask and puppet theatre.

In Germany, the Augsburger Puppenkiste since 1948 has produced theatrical adaptations of fairy tales and serious pieces. In 1953, it began producing television series with productions such as &quot;Jim Knopf und Lukas der Lokomotivführer&quot; and &quot;Urmel aus dem Eis&quot;.

In Austria, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre was founded in 1913 by Professor Anton Aicher. Aicher was heavily influenced by Count Franz Pocci who founded the Munich Marionette Theatre in Germany in 1855. Until 2012, the Salzburg Marionette Theatre was under the artistic direction of his granddaughter, Gretl Aicher, who commented on her lasting interest in marionettes, &quot;What then is the fascination of a life with marionettes? Is it the pleasure of performing? The appeal of mastering an &#x27;instrument&#x27; to the point of virtuosity? The transformation of one&#x27;s own self? For me, it is the process of empathizing with mind and soul, of feeling at one with music and movement that bring these much-loved creatures to life.&quot; The Salzburg Marionette Theatre performs mainly operas such as &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; and a small number of ballets such as &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre productions are aimed at adults although children are welcome. There is also a marionette theatre at Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna.

In the Czech Republic marionette theatre has a very long history in entertainment in Prague. An important organisation is the National Marionette Theatre. Its repertoire mainly features a marionette production of Mozart&#x27;s famous &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. The production has period costumes and a beautifully designed 18th-century setting. There are numerous other companies including, Buchty a Loutky (Cakes and Puppets) founded by Marek Bečka. &quot;Rocky IX&quot; and &quot;Tibet&quot; are just two works in the repertoire.

In Australia, like in many other countries, there is a continuing tradition of marionette puppetry. Norman Hetherington OAM, Peter Scriven (founder of the Marionette Theatre of Australia) Richard Bradshaw OAM and David Splatt (Smallpox Theatre), David Hamilton and Murray Raine are notable puppeteers. The late Phillip Edmiston performed with his Queensland Marionette Theatre a range of productions including the spectacular &quot;The Grand Adventure&quot;.

In Picardy, Lafleur is a marionette from Amiens. The &quot;Cabotans d&#x27;Amiens&quot; are hand-carved, using wood, with a central rod and strings for the arms and legs. In France, the most famous puppet is the Guignol which is a hand puppet created in Lyon in 1808.

In the United States, several groups have established permanent theatres or touring programs dedicated to spotlighting marionette performances. The Cole Marionettes were founded by George and Lucille Cole in Chicago circa 1934. The Bob Baker Marionette Theater in Los Angeles is now considered a historical landmark, presented a variety of cabaret marionette shows. The Puppetworks theatre in New York under the direction of Nick Coppola has been in operation since 1980. The Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta develops and fosters marionette performers from across the globe. Le Theatre de Marionette in Dallas has recreated a traditional marionette theatre with puppeteer bridge and full stage productions. The theatre is open year-round. The National Marionette Theater with David Syrotiak at its helm has developed some of the most artistically staged shows to grace the American stage. The Fratello Marionettes of Danville, California stage shows that are well crafted and display an almost Disney-esque quality. The Bil Baird theatre in Greenwich Village closed in 1987 but was a nationally recognized treasure that presented countless shows to families for over a decade, including their contribution to film and television with the famous Lonely Goatherd scene from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. The Frisch Marionettes in Cincinnati were founded by Kevin Frisch, who has been considered one of the best stage marionette artists of his time. His manipulation and ability to transfer lifelike movement to the inanimate has been compared to the German master puppeteer, Albrecht Roser. Joseph Cashore has been touring the United States for over 30 years with a collection of self-designed marionettes.

===Television and film===

With the rise in popularity of television and film, marionettes found a rise in popularity, especially in children&#x27;s programming. The story of Pinocchio and its Disney adaptation (&quot;Pinocchio&quot;), which was released in 1940, is a story about a marionette. In 1947, &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; introduced marionettes to children&#x27;s television, with Howdy Doody (the main character) being a marionette, as well as some other characters.

In the 1950s, Bil Baird and Cora Eisenberg presented a great number of marionette shows for television, and were also responsible for the Lonely Goatherd sequence from the classic film &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Bil Baird also wrote a classic book on his work. In Australia, a program called &quot;Mr. Squiggle&quot;, using a marionette central character of the same name, ran for just over 40 years (1959–1999). Another program for children using puppetry was the &quot;Magic Circle Club&quot; featuring puppets Cassius Cuckoo and Leonardo de Funbird.

From the 1940s onward, the BBC in the United Kingdom, produced a wide series of marionette programmes for children and then created The &quot;BBC Television Puppet Theatre&quot; based in &quot;Lime Grove Studios&quot; from 1955 to 1964. They were usually shown under the title &quot;Watch With Mother&quot; The various programmes included &quot;Whirligig&quot;, &quot;The Woodentops&quot;, &quot;Bill and Ben&quot;, &quot;Muffin The Mule&quot;, &quot;Rubovia&quot; a series created by Gordon Murray and &quot;Andy Pandy&quot;. Later in the 1960s, Gerry Anderson with his wife, Sylvia Anderson and colleagues made a number of hit series, &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, &quot;Stingray&quot; and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, which pioneered a technique combining marionettes and electronics. This allowed for radio control moving of the mouth of a marionettes. The technique was patented and called &quot;supermarionation&quot;. The programs have been shown all around the world and are now widely distributed on DVD. Anderson also made two films, &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; and &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot;. During the 1970s in the UK TV series using marionettes include &quot;The Adventures of Rupert Bear&quot;, &quot;Mumfie&quot; and &quot;Cloppa Castle&quot;. Some marionettes appear in &quot;Pipkins&quot; namely Octavia Ostrich. More recently marionettes are starting to re-emerge on the TV screen, Coca-Cola have used marionettes to create a series of adverts based in an office and music videos use them regularly as metaphors.

Marionettes are featured in the 1999 film, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. John Cusack played a manipulator who referred to himself as a puppeteer.

The BBC children&#x27;s show &quot;Playbus&quot; (later &quot;Playdays&quot;) used many puppets during their commission, notably a singing and dancing marionette called Lizzie Dreams, sometimes paired up with another marionette called Nick.

&quot;Team America: World Police&quot; is a 2004 movie made by &quot;South Park&quot; creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker which uses a crude, naive, childlike style of Supermarionation as in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. Matt Stone and Trey Parker dubbed their version &quot;Supercrappymation&quot; due to the fact they intentionally left the strings visible, among other reasons.

Also appearing in 2004 was the full-length, award-winning marionette fantasy film &quot;Strings&quot;, directed by Anders Rønnow Klarlund.

A marionette was also used in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Shakespeare Code&quot;.

==Control bar types==
===Asian paddle===
This type of control has many strings attached to a rounded rectangular paddle with a short handle, all the strings are attached and hang from the outer edge of the paddle and are used by selecting each string with the opposite hand and pulling to control the figure which hangs below.

===Horizontal===
This control is a bar that is held in the hand in a horizontal plane. There can be numerous bars at right angles to the central bar, which in turn attach via wires to the hands, shoulders, back, etc. A smaller plate is usually hung under the main bar, and this carries the head strings; likewise, a detachable clip usually holds the leg bar. This style of control is generally used in the US for human figures and is also known as the American control. A similar control is almost universally used for quadruped animals; as it emulates the basic shape of the animal, rocking it from side to side will control the leg movements in unison. The Salzburg Marionette Theatre in Austria also uses a variant of this style for its human characters.

===Vertical===
This type of control is an upright bar that has various smaller bars inserted at right angles from which the head, shoulder, back etc. strings etc. are attached to. This control usually has a detachable leg bar that controls walking when held in the opposite hand. The arms are controlled by wires which are inserted into a hole in the shaft bent at approximately 45 degrees to the shaft and hang loosely with a loop at the end to attach the hand strings, these are then moved by the fingers holding the main shaft. A tilt of the main upright controls the head and body with a fine nuance, This type of control is usually called the British control.
Another variation of the vertical control is found in Europe usually a rigid wire rod extends from the centre of the head upward and is fixed rigidly to the control, The leg bar is inserted through the main upright but pivots on a pin to allow movement of the legs.

==Styles==
===British===
British marionettes are similar to German marionettes. The usual human form has nine strings — one string to each knee, hand and shoulder, two strings to the head and one string to the lower back. The control is usually the British upright control with separate leg bar. Optional stringing includes elbows, forehead or nose.

Pelham Puppets are a commercially made British puppet who usually have seven strings that are attached to the legs, hands, head and back. The controls are usually a horizontal folding cross bar. Bob Pelham developed the British marionettes in 1947.

===Burmese===

Burmese marionettes are all string operated and are a popular art in Burma. Marionettes are called Yoke thé (lit. miniatures) and are almost always performed in operas. A Burmese marionette troupe must have 27 characters, including a king, animals such as horse, elephant, tiger, monkey and parrot, ministers, prince and princess and buffoons A hsaing waing, a traditional Burmese orchestra usually provides the music. Burmese marionettes are very intricate and dexterous as they employ 18 (for male characters) or 19 (for female) wires, each puppet controlled only by one puppeteer.

===Czech===
Czech rod marionettes are similar to Sicilian ones though they are more complex. They are hand-carved, usually using lime wood. The marionettes have the central rod-like the Sicilian marionette but also have strings for the arms and legs. Sometimes they also use string to control a mouth or movable ears. These require more skilled manipulation. Czechs also have marionettes that have no central rod and strings that are attached to the head, shoulders, and back. These are the most difficult marionettes to manipulate due to the absence of the central rod. Miroslav Trejtnar is an acknowledged master puppeteer and teacher of traditional Czech marionette-making skills.

A BBC article explains how this craft saved Czech culture and language from being eradicated in favor of German.

===German===
They have eight strings that are attached to the legs, hands, head, shoulders, and back. The controls are horizontal.

===Sicilian===
Sicilian marionettes are among the simplest marionettes to operate. They are usually carved out of wood and have a sturdy rod that extends up through the body into the head. This rod, and one string attached to the hand, controls the manipulation of the puppet.

<text>People&#x27;s war or protracted people&#x27;s war is a Maoist military strategy. First developed by the Chinese communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong (1893–1976), the basic concept behind people&#x27;s war is to maintain the support of the population and draw the enemy deep into the countryside (stretching their supply lines) where the population will bleed them dry through guerrilla warfare and eventually build up to mobile warfare. It was used by the Chinese communists against the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II, and by the Chinese Soviet Republic in the Chinese Civil War.

The term is used by Maoists for their strategy of long-term armed revolutionary struggle. After the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979, Deng Xiaoping abandoned people&#x27;s war for &quot;People&#x27;s War under Modern Conditions&quot;, which moved away from reliance on troops over technology. With the adoption of &quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot;, economic reforms fueled military and technological investment. Troop numbers were also reduced and professionalisation encouraged.

The strategy of people&#x27;s war was used heavily by the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War. However, protracted war should not be confused with the &quot;foco&quot; theory employed by Che Guevara and Fidel Castro in the Cuban Revolution of 1959.

==Overview==
===In China===

In its original formulation by Chairman Mao Zedong, people&#x27;s war exploits the few advantages that a small revolutionary movement has—broad-based popular support can be one of them—against a state&#x27;s power with a large, professional, well-equipped and well-funded army. People&#x27;s war strategically avoids decisive battles, since a tiny force of a few dozen soldiers would easily be routed in an all-out confrontation with the state. Instead, it favours a three-phase strategy of protracted warfare, with carefully chosen battles that can realistically be won.

In phase one, the revolutionary force conducting people&#x27;s war starts in a remote area with mountainous or forested terrain in which its enemy is weak. It attempts to establish a local stronghold known as a revolutionary base area. As it grows in power, it enters phase two, establishes other revolutionary base areas and spreads its influence through the surrounding countryside, where it may become the governing power and gain popular support through such programmes as land reform. Eventually in phase three, the movement has enough strength to encircle and capture small cities, then larger ones, until finally it seizes power in the entire country.

Within the Chinese Red Army, the concept of people&#x27;s war was the basis of strategy against the Japanese, and against a hypothetical Soviet invasion of China. The concept of people&#x27;s war became less important with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the increasing possibility of conflict with the United States over Taiwan. In the 1980s and 1990s the concept of people&#x27;s war was changed to include more high-technology weaponry.

Historian David Priestland dates the beginning of the policy of people&#x27;s war to the publication of a &quot;General Outline for Military Work&quot; in May 1928, by Chinese Central Committee. This document established official military strategies to the Chinese Red Army during the Chinese Civil War.

The strategy of people&#x27;s war has political dimensions in addition to its military dimensions. In China, the early People&#x27;s Liberation Army was composed of peasants who had previously lacked political significance and control over their place in the social order. Its internal organization was egalitarian between soldiers and officers, and its external relationship with rural civilians was egalitarian. As sociologist Alessandro Russo summarizes, the political existence of peasants via the PLA was a radical exception to the rules of Chinese society and &quot;overturned the strict traditional hierarchies in unprecedented forms of egalitarianism.&quot;

==== Other usage in Chinese rhetoric ====
In 2014 Party leadership in Xinjiang commenced a People&#x27;s War against the “Three Evil Forces” of separatism, terrorism, and extremism. They deployed two hundred thousand party cadres to Xinjiang and launched the Civil Servant-Family Pair Up program. Xi was dissatisfied with the initial results of the People&#x27;s War and replaced Zhang Chunxian with Chen Quanguo in 2016. Following his appointment Chen oversaw the recruitment of tens of thousands of additional police officers and the division of society into three categories: trustworthy, average, untrustworthy. He instructed his subordinated to “Take this crackdown as the top project,” and “to preempt the enemy, to strike at the outset.” Following a meeting with Xi in Beijing Chen Quanguo held a rally in Ürümqi with ten thousand troops, helicopters, and armored vehicles. As they paraded he announced a “smashing, obliterating offensive,” and declared that they would “bury the corpses of terrorists and terror gangs in the vast sea of the People&#x27;s War.”

In February 2020, the Chinese Communist Party launched an aggressive campaign described by the Xi Jinping as a &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

===Outside China===
In non-communist states such as Iran, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps used the protracted people&#x27;s war against Iraq.

==List of people&#x27;s wars==
Conflicts in the following list are failed and successful wars labelled as people&#x27;s wars by Maoists, and also both failed and ongoing attempts to start and develop people&#x27;s wars. In addition to the conflicts in the list, there also have been conflicts not primarily led by Maoists or seen as people&#x27;s wars, but had Maoist groups involved within them who viewed the conflicts partly as such, including the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (Arab–Israeli conflict) and the Communist Party of Burma (Myanmar civil war).

<doc id="301273" wikidata="Q465324" url="?curid=301273" title="Qiu Jin">
<text>Qiu Jin (; 8 November 1875 – 15 July 1907) was a Chinese revolutionary, feminist, and writer. Her courtesy names are Xuanqing () and Jingxiong (). Her sobriquet name is Jianhu Nüxia (). Qiu was executed after a failed uprising against the Qing dynasty and is considered a national heroine in China and a martyr of republicanism and feminism.

== Biography ==
Born in Fujian, China, Qiu Jin spent her childhood in her ancestral home, Shaoxing, Zhejiang. Qiu was born into a wealthy family. Her grandfather worked in the Xiamen city government and was responsible for the city&#x27;s defense. Zhejiang province was famous for female education, and Qiu Jin had support from her family when she was young to pursue her educational interests. Her father, Qiu Shounan, was a government official and her mother came from a distinguished literati-official family. Qiu Jin&#x27;s wealthy and educated background, along with her early exposure to political ideologies were key factors in her transformation to becoming a female pioneer for the woman&#x27;s liberation movement and the republican revolution in China.

In the early 1900s, Japan had started to experience western influences earlier than China. As to not fall behind, the Qing government sent many elites to learn from the Japanese. Qiu Jin was one of these elites that got the chance to study overseas. After studying in a women&#x27;s school in Japan, Qiu returned to China to participate in a variety of revolutionary activities; and through her involvement with these activities, it became clear how Qiu wanted others to perceive her. Qiu called herself &#x27;Female Knight-Errant of Jian Lake&#x27; — the role of the knight-errant, established in the Han dynasty, was a prototypically male figure known for swordsmanship, bravery, faithfulness, and self-sacrifice — and &#x27;Vying for Heroism&#x27;.

=== Early life in China ===
==== Childhood activities ====
Qiu Jin had her feet bound and began writing poetry at an early age. With the support from her family, Qiu Jin also learned how to ride a horse and use a sword—activities that usually only men were permitted to learn at the time.

==== Marriage ====
In 1896 Qiu Jin got married. At the time she was only 21, which was considered late for a woman of that time. Qiu Jin&#x27;s father arranged her marriage to Wang Tingchun, the youngest son of a wealthy merchant in Hunan province. Qiu Jin did not get along well with her husband, as her husband only cared about enjoying himself. While in an unhappy marriage, Qiu came into contact with new ideas. The failure of her marriage affected her decisions later on, including choosing to study in Japan.

==== Aftermath of First Sino-Japanese War ====
The Qing government lost the Sino-Japanese war from 1894 to 1895. Losing to Japan in this war woke the Qing government up to the fact that China was no longer the most powerful nation even in Asia. Japan had started learning western technology and accepting western standards earlier than China. This motivated the Qing government to progress and modernize. The Dowager Empress Cixi looked to Japan as a model to emulate, and her court organized tours to Japan. Many Chinese elites were sent to Japan to learn how they could build China like the Japanese were able to do. Qiu Jin was one of the girls who got the chance to study overseas as these opportunities were only given to the children of higher social class.

=== Life while studying in Japan ===
In 1903, she decided to travel overseas and study in Tokyo, Japan, leaving her two children behind. She initially entered a Japanese language school in Surugadai, but later transferred to the Girls&#x27; Practical School in Kōjimachi, run by Shimoda Utako (later to become Jissen Women&#x27;s University). The school prepared Qiu Jin with the skills she needed for revolutionary activities later on. With the education from Shimoda school, many female activists participated in the Republican Revolution in 1911. During her time in Tokyo, Qiu also helped to establish the Encompassing Love Society, a women&#x27;s group that promoted women&#x27;s education and protested the Russian presence in northeast China. She was very fond of martial arts, and she was known by her acquaintances for wearing Western male dress and for her nationalist, anti-Manchu ideology. She joined the anti-Qing society Guangfuhui, led by Cai Yuanpei, which in 1905 joined with a variety of overseas Chinese revolutionary groups to form the Tongmenghui, led by Sun Yat-sen. Already known as a calligrapher and a poet, Qiu described herself as “tossing aside the brush to join the military ranks,” in encouraging educated women not to waste time on poetry but to instead engage in direct action.

Within the Revolutionary Alliance, Qiu was responsible for the Zhejiang Province. Because the Chinese overseas students were divided between those who wanted an immediate return to China to join the ongoing revolution and those who wanted to stay in Japan to prepare for the future, a meeting of Zhejiang students was held to debate the issue. At the meeting, Qiu allied unquestioningly with the former group and thrust a dagger into the podium, declaring, &quot;If I return to the motherland, surrender to the Manchu barbarians, and deceive the Han people, stab me with this dagger!&quot; She subsequently returned to China in 1906 along with about 2,000 students.

While still in Tokyo, Qiu single-handedly edited a journal, &quot;Vernacular Journal&quot; (&quot;Baihua Bao&quot;). A number of issues were published using vernacular Chinese as a medium of revolutionary propaganda. In one issue, Qiu wrote &quot;A Respectful Proclamation to China&#x27;s 200 Million Women Comrades&quot;, a manifesto within which she lamented the problems caused by bound feet and oppressive marriages. Having suffered from both ordeals herself, Qiu explained her experience in the manifesto and received an overwhelmingly sympathetic response from her readers. Also outlined in the manifesto was Qiu&#x27;s belief that a better future for women lay under a Western-type government instead of the Qing government that was in power at the time. She joined forces with her cousin Xu Xilin and together they worked to unite many secret revolutionary societies to work together for the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.

Between 1905 and 1907, Qiu Jin was also writing a novel called Stones of the Jingwei Bird in traditional ballad form, a type of literature often composed by women for women audiences. The novel describes the relationship between five wealthy women who decide to flee their families and the arranged marriages awaiting them in order to study and join revolutionary activities in Tokyo. Titles for the later uncompleted chapters suggest that the women will go on to talk about “education, manufacturing, military activities, speechmaking, and direct political action, eventually overthrowing the Qing dynasty and establishing a republic” — all of which were subject matters that Qiu either participated in or advocated for.

=== Life after returning to China ===
Qiu Jin was known as an eloquent orator who spoke out for women&#x27;s rights, such as the freedom to marry, freedom of education, and abolishment of the practice of foot binding. In 1906 she founded &quot;China Women&#x27;s News&quot; (&quot;Zhongguo nü bao&quot;), a radical women&#x27;s journal with another female poet, Xu Zihua in Shanghai. They published only two issues before it was closed by the authorities. In 1907, she became head of the Datong school in Shaoxing, ostensibly a school for sport teachers, but really intended for the military training of revolutionaries. While teaching in Datong school, she kept secret connection with local underground organization—The Restoration Society. This organization aimed to overthrow the Manchu government and restore Chinese rule.

=== Death ===
In 1907, Xu Xilin, Qiu&#x27;s friend and the Datong school&#x27;s co-founder was executed for attempting to assassinate his Manchu superior. In the same year, the authorities arrested Qiu at the school for girls where she was the principal. She was tortured but refused to admit her involvement in the plot. Instead the authorities used her own writings as incrimination against her and, a few days later, she was publicly beheaded in her home village, Shanyin, at the age of 31. Her last written words, her death poem, uses the literal meaning of her name, Autumn Gem, to lament of the failed revolution that she would never see take place:

 &lt;br&gt; 
&quot;(Autumn wind, autumn rain — they make one die of sorrow)&quot;During Qiu&#x27;s life, she also drew support from two close friends: Xu Zihua and Wu Zhiying — both of whom had sworn sisterhood with her. In the months following Qiu&#x27;s execution, Wu wrote three essays mourning Qiu — in which she criticized Qing officials for the execution and argued that Qiu Jin had been slandered and her actions “unjustly besmirched”. Soon after, the two sworn sisters set out to bury Qiu properly near West Lake, fulfilling Qiu&#x27;s wish to be buried near heroes of earlier periods. Qing officials soon ordered for her tomb to be razed, but Qiu Jin&#x27;s brother managed to retrieve her body in time. Ultimately, Wu Zhiying took possession of the memorial stele, installing it in her own house and selling stele rubbings as a way to commemorate her fallen friend.

To this day, people continue to have varying opinions towards Qiu&#x27;s death. Many said that her death was unnecessary because she had enough time to escape before being caught by imperial soldiers. In fact, Qiu&#x27;s friends even warned her of incoming soldiers immediately after Xu Xilin&#x27;s death. Lu Xun, one of China&#x27;s greatest 20th-century writers was one of her biggest critics; he “[...] believed Qiu’s reckless behavior in Shaoxing was linked to the enormous adulation she received during her time in Japan.” She was “clapped to death,” he told a friend — although there is no clear explanation as to why Qiu decided to remain at the school despite knowing that the authorities were on their way.

== Legacy ==
Qiu was posthumously immortalized in the Republic of China&#x27;s popular consciousness and literature. She is buried beside West Lake in Hangzhou. The People&#x27;s Republic of China established a museum for her in Shaoxing, Qiu Jin&#x27;s Former Residence (紹興秋瑾故居).

Chinese scholar Hu Ying, professor of East Asian Languages and Literature at the University of California, Irvine, published a monograph on Qiu in 2016, &quot;Burying Autumn&quot;, that explores Qiu Jin&#x27;s friendship with her sworn sisters Wu Zhiying and Xu Zihua and situates her work in the larger sociopolitical and literary context of the time.

Her life has been portrayed in plays, popular movies (including the 1972 Hong Kong film &quot;Chow Ken&quot; (《秋瑾》), and the documentary &quot;Autumn Gem&quot;, written by Rae Chang and directed by Chang and Adam Tow. One film, simply titled &quot;Qiu Jin&quot;, was released in 1983 and directed by Xie Jin. Another film, released in 2011, &quot;Jing Xiong Nüxia Qiu Jin&quot; (競雄女俠秋瑾), or &quot;The Woman Knight of Mirror Lake&quot;, was directed by Herman Yau. She is briefly shown in the beginning of &quot;1911&quot;, being led to the execution ground to be beheaded. The movie was directed by Jackie Chan and Zhang Li. Immediately after her death Chinese playwrights used the incident, &quot;resulting in at least eight plays before the end of the Ch&#x27;ing dynasty.&quot;

In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary for her.

== Literary works ==
Because Qiu is mainly remembered in the West as revolutionary and feminist, her poetry and essays are often overlooked (though owing to her early death, they are few). Her writing reflects an exceptional education in classical literature, and she writes traditional poetry (&quot;shi&quot; and &quot;ci&quot;). Qiu composes verse with a wide range of metaphors and allusions that mix classical mythology with revolutionary rhetoric.

For example, in a poem, &quot;A Reply Verse in Matching Rhyme (for Ishii-kun, a Japanese friend)&quot;, she wrote the following:

Editors Sun Chang and Saussy explain the metaphors as follows:
: line 4: &quot;Your islands&quot; translates &quot;sandao,&quot; literally &quot;three islands,&quot; referring to Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu, while omitting Hokkaido - an old-fashioned way of referring to Japan.

: line 6: ... the conditions of the bronze camels, symbolic guardians placed before the imperial palace, is traditionally considered to reflect the state of health of the ruling dynasty. But in Qiu&#x27;s poetry, it reflects instead the state of health of China.

On leaving Beijing for Japan, she wrote a poem, &quot;Reflections (written during travels in Japan)&quot; summarizing her life until that point:

War flames in the north‒when will it all end?

I hear the fighting at sea continues unabated.

Like the women of Qishi, I worry about my country in vain;

It&#x27;s hard to trade kerchief and dress for a helmet

<text>Marche ( ; ), in English sometimes referred to as the Marches ( ), is one of the twenty regions of Italy. The region is located in the central area of the country, and has a population of about 1.5 million people, being the thirteenth largest region in the country by number of inhabitants. The region&#x27;s capital and largest city is Ancona.

The Marche region is bordered by Emilia-Romagna and the republic of San Marino to the north, Tuscany and Umbria to the west, Lazio to the southwest, Abruzzo to the south, and the Adriatic Sea to the east. Except for river valleys and the often very narrow coastal strip, the land is hilly. A railway from Bologna to Brindisi, built in the 19th century, runs along the coast of the entire territory. Inland, the mountainous nature of the region, even today, allows relatively little travel north and south, except by twisting roads over the passes. 

From the Middle ages to the Renaissance period, many cities of the Marche were important cultural, artistic and commercial centres, the most prominent being Ancona, Pesaro, Urbino, Camerino and Ascoli Piceno.

Urbino, which was a major centre of Renaissance history, was also the birthplace of Raphael, one of the most important painters and architects of that period. The Marche region is also the birthplace of Gentile da Fabriano, Cyriacus of Ancona, Donato Bramante, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Giacomo Leopardi, Gioachino Rossini and Maria Montessori.

== Toponymy ==
The name of the region derives from the plural of the medieval word &quot;&quot;, a march or mark, that is, a border zone, originally referring to a borderland territory of the Holy Roman Empire, such as the March of Ancona and others pertaining to the ancient region.

== Geography ==
Marche extends over an area of of the central Adriatic slope between Emilia-Romagna to the north, Tuscany and Umbria to the west, and Lazio and Abruzzo to the south, the entire eastern boundary being formed by the Adriatic. The Umbrian enclave of Monte Ruperto (a subdivision of the Comune of Città di Castello) is entirely surrounded by the Province of Pesaro and Urbino, which constitutes the northern part of the region.

Most of the region is mountainous or hilly: the Apennine range runs longitudinally along the region&#x27;s eastern border and descends through a hilly landscape towards the Adriatic sea. With the sole exception of Monte Vettore, high, the mountains do not exceed . The hilly area covers two-thirds of the region and is intersected by wide gullies with numerous short rivers and by alluvial plains perpendicular to the Appennini range. The main mountain range has a few deep river gorges: the best known are those of the Furlo, the Rossa and the Frasassi.

The coastline is long and is relatively flat and straight except for the hilly area between Gabicce and Pesaro in the north, and the eastern slopes of Monte Conero near Ancona.

Climate is temperate. Inland, in the mountainous areas, is more continental with cold and often snowy winters; by the sea is more mediterranean. Precipitation varies from per year inland and per year on the Adriatic coast.

A region with an annular drainage pattern possibly corresponding to a mud diapir or astrobleme exists near Sant&#x27;Angelo in Pontano.

As of 2023, according to the report on land consumption of the Higher Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, Marche and Liguria hold the Italian record for coastal overbuilding.

== History ==
Marche was known in ancient times as the Picenum territory. The first period of cultural unity of the Marches was in the Iron Age, when the region was almost entirely inhabited by the Picentes. Many artefacts from their time are exhibited in National Archaeological Museum of the Marche Region in Ancona. In the fourth century BC, the northern area was occupied by the Senones, a tribe of Gauls. The Battle of Sentinum was fought in Marche in 295 BC; afterwards, the Romans founded numerous colonies in the area, connected to Rome by the Via Flaminia and the Via Salaria. Ascoli was a seat of Italic resistance during the Social War (91–87 BC).

Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the region was invaded by the Goths. After the Gothic War, it was part of the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna (Ancona, Fano, Pesaro, Rimini, and Senigallia forming the so-called Pentapolis). After the fall of the Exarchate, it was briefly in the possession of the Lombards, but was conquered by Charlemagne in the late eighth century. In the ninth to eleventh centuries, the marches of Camerino, Fermo and Ancona were created, hence the modern name.

Marche was nominally part of the Papal States, but most of the territory was under local lords, while the major cities ruled themselves as free communes. In the twelfth century, the commune of Ancona resisted both the imperial authority of Frederick Barbarossa and the Republic of Venice, and was a maritime republic on its own. An attempt to restore Papal suzerainty by Gil de Albornoz in the fourteenth century was short-lived.

During the Renaissance, the region was fought over by rival aristocratic families, such as the Malatesta of Rimini, Pesaro, Fano and the house of Montefeltro of Urbino. The last independent entity, the Duchy of Urbino, was dissolved in 1631, and from then on, Marche was firmly part of the Papal States except during the Napoleonic period. This saw the short-lived Republic of Ancona, in 1797–98; the merging of the region with the Roman Republic in 1798–99, and with the Kingdom of Italy from 1808 to 1813; and the short occupation by Joachim Murat in 1815. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, Marche returned to Papal rule until 4 November 1860, when it was annexed to the unified Kingdom of Italy by a plebiscite.

The Bombardment of Ancona occurred during the Adriatic campaign of World War I. The 1916 Rimini earthquakes damaged or destroyed several buildings in Pesaro, Fano, and its hinterlands.

The Battle of Ancona occurred during the Italian campaign of World War II.

After the referendum of 2006, 7 municipalities of Montefeltro were detached from the Province of Pesaro and Urbino to join the Province of Rimini (Emilia-Romagna) on 15 August 2009. The municipalities are Casteldelci, Maiolo, Novafeltria, Pennabilli, San Leo, Sant&#x27;Agata Feltria and Talamello.

Towns in Marche were devastated by many powerful earthquakes during the centuries, the last time in 2016 (in August and in October).

In September 2022, Marche was hit by heavy flooding.

== Economy ==

Prior to the 1980s, Marche was considered a rather poor region, although economically stable in some sectors, thanks particularly to its agricultural output and to the contribution of traditional crafts.

Today the contribution of agriculture to the economy of the region is less significant and the gross value generated by this sector remains slightly above the national average. Marche has never suffered from the extremes of fragmented land ownership or &#x27;latifondo&#x27;. Greatly diffused in the past, the sharecropping never produced an extreme land fragmentation. The main products are cereals, vegetables, animal products and grapes. Truffle hunting is popular; although it has often led to &#x27;truffle wars&#x27; between hunters due to the imposition of quotas. Olives are also produced and managed by various harvesters. In spite of the marine impoverishment, the sea has always furnished a plentiful supply of fish, the main fishing centres being Ancona, San Benedetto del Tronto, Fano and Civitanova Marche.

Since the 1980s, the economy of the region has been radically transformed without, however, repudiating its rural past. Many of the small craft workshops scattered throughout the rural settlements have modernised and become small businesses, some of which have become major brands known all over the world (Indesit, Tod&#x27;s, Guzzini, Teuco). This evolution led to the emergence of &#x27;specialized&#x27; industrial areas, which are still profitable: 
* footwear and leather goods in a large area straddling the provinces of Macerata and Fermo; 
* furniture in the Pesaro area in particular; 
* household appliances and textile industry in the province of Ancona, in which the main engineering companies are also to be found (including ship building, petrochemicals and paper, as well as consumer durables). 
* The city of Castelfidardo remains an important centre for the production of musical instruments, the accordion in particular. 

The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 43.3 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.5% of Italy&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 28,200 euros or 94% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 96% of the EU average.

The unemployment rate stood at 7.4% in 2020. Marche is well known for its shoemaking tradition, with fine and luxurious Italian footwear manufacturing facilities in the region.

===Tourism===
The region continues to draw tourists, whose increasing numbers have been attracted by the rich and broadly distributed heritage of history and monuments, as well as by the traditional seaside resorts. Marche has many small and picturesque villages, 31 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities.

== Demographics ==

The population density in the region is below the national average. In 2008, it was , compared to the national figure of . It is highest in the province of Ancona ( inhabitants per km2), and lowest in the province of Macerata (). Between 1952 and 1967 the population of the region decreased by 1.7% as a result of a negative migration balance, well above the national average, with a rate varying between 4.9 and 10.0 per 1,000 inhabitants. The Average fund of this region is worth about a few million or maybe higher. In the same period the natural balance of the population was positive, but lower than the national average and insufficient to counterbalance the net emigration. The population continued to decline until 1971, but in 1968 began growing again. In 2008, the Italian national institute of statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 115,299 foreign-born immigrants live in Marche, 7.4% of the total regional population.

== Government and politics ==

Marche forms, along with Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany and Umbria, the Italian &quot;Red Quadrilateral&quot;, a strongly left-wing area. In the 2014 European elections, the people of Marche gave 45% of their votes to Matteo Renzi&#x27;s Democratic Party.

As of the 2020 Marche regional election Marche is governed by the centre-right coalition.

== Administrative divisions ==
The region is divided into five provinces: Ancona, Ascoli Piceno, Fermo, Macerata, Pesaro e Urbino.

<doc id="301300" wikidata="Q93179" url="?curid=301300" title="List of municipalities in Cantabria">
<text>[[Cantabria]] is one of the sixteen autonomous communities of Spain. It is divided into 102 municipalities, in accordance with the organizations of territories put forth in Article 137 of the 1978 Constitution of Spain:

Municipal boundaries are defined in Spain&#x27;s &quot;Ley Reguladora de las Bases del Régimen Local&quot;. These include &quot;the basic local entity of the territorial organization of the state&quot;, with &quot;legal status and full capability for the completion of their ends&quot; and their elements are &quot;the territory, the population, and the organization&quot;&quot;.&quot;

The administration and the governance of municipalities proceeds from a low level organ termed the local government or mayoralty, which is headed by a single person: an &quot;alcalde&quot;. Until 2011, the municipalities of Tresviso and Pesquera had been governed through a direct democratic system, but with the change in the law, both abandoned this system in order to adopt representative government forms that use a mayor-council system.

In general, municipalities are subdivided into various localities, one of which serves as the municipal seat and usually plays host to the town hall. Some municipalities take the name of one of their localities—be it their municipal seat or not—while others contain a name distinct from any of the localities therein. There also exist other sub-municipal government organs that enjoy some extent of autonomy in their management. These are called minor local entities, which correspond to villages, parishes, or districts, whose representation resides in a neighborhood board. Each of these entities has a municipal code composed of five or six numbers; the first two correspond to the provincial code, while the next three numbers refer to the municipality within the particular province. The sixth and final number is a check digit that is used in order to identify errors.

One should note that the Community of Campoo-Cabuérniga does not constitute a municipality &quot;per se&quot;, but rather is a &quot;sui generis&quot; territorial entity within Cantabria. Due to its unique size and makeup, the management of the locale is shared between the surrounding municipalities of Hermandad de Campoo de Suso, Cabuérniga, Los Tojos, and Ruente.

== Municipal elections ==

Municipal elections are held the fourth Sunday of May every four years, coinciding with the date of the elections for the Parliament of Cantabria.

The electoral system is regulated by the Organic Law of the General Electoral Regime (LOREG) and is based upon voting on party lists and assigning councilors in line with the D&#x27;Hondt method. The electoral threshold for a party to gain representation is five percent of the valid votes cast.

The citizens of member countries of the European Union who maintain residency in Cantabria have the right to vote and run for office, in accordance with the laws that have been established in order to comply with EU Directive 94/80/CE.

The citizens of countries that have reciprocity agreements with Spain are able to vote in Cantabrian elections in the same manner as EU citizens. Countries with such agreements include: Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Chile, Colombia, South Korea, Ecuador, Iceland, New Zealand, Paraguay, Perú, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Additionally, citizens of Spain who reside in some foreign countries, such as Norway, also are able to exercise their right to vote in Cantabrian elections, even though there is no reciprocity agreement between Norway and Spain.

The number of councilors a municipality elects depends on its population:

* Up to 100 inhabitants: 3 councilors.
* From 101 to 250: 5 councilors.
* From 251 to 1000: 7 councilors.
* From 1001 to 2000: 9 councilors.
* From 2001 to 5000: 11 councilors.
* From 5001 to 10,000: 13 councilors.
* From 10,001 to 20,000: 17 councilors.
* From 20,001 to 50,000: 21 councilors.
* From 50,001 to 100,000: 25 councilors.

<text>The Aosta Valley ( ; ; ; or ), officially the Autonomous Region of Aosta Valley, is a mountainous autonomous region in northwestern Italy. It is bordered by Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, France, to the west; by Valais, Switzerland, to the north; and by Piedmont, Italy, to the south and east. The regional capital is Aosta.

Covering an area of and with a population of about 128,000, it is the smallest, least populous, and least densely populated region of Italy. The province of Aosta having been dissolved in 1945, the Aosta Valley region was the first region of Italy to abolish provincial subdivisions, followed by Friuli-Venezia Giulia in 2017 (where they were reestablished later). Provincial administrative functions are provided by the regional government. The region is divided into 74 ().

Italian and French are the official languages, and the Valdôtain dialect of Franco-Provençal is also officially recognized. Italian is spoken as a mother tongue by 77.29% of the population, Valdôtain by 17.91%, and French by 1.25%. In 2009, reportedly 50.53% of the population could speak all three languages.

==Geography==

The Aosta Valley is an Alpine valley which, with its tributary valleys, includes the Italian slopes of Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa, Gran Paradiso and the Matterhorn; its highest peak is Mont Blanc (). This makes it the highest region in Italy, according to the list of Italian regions by highest point.

===Climate===
The valleys, usually above , annually have a cold continental climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;). In this climate, the snow season is very long, as long as 8 or 9 months at the highest points. During the summer, mist occurs almost every day. These areas are the wettest in the western Alps. Temperatures in January are low, between , and in July are between .

Areas between usually have a tundra climate (ET), where every month has an average temperature below . This climate may be either a kind of more severe cold oceanic climate, with a low summer average but mild winters, sometimes above , especially near lakes, or a more severe cold continental climate, with a very low winter average. Temperature averages in Plateau Rosa, at high, are in January and in July. It is the coldest place in Italy where the climate is verifiable.

In the past, above , all months had an average temperature below freezing, with a perpetual frost climate (EF). In recent years, however, there has been a rise in temperatures. See, as an example, the data for Plateau Rosa.

==History==
Early inhabitants of the Aosta Valley were Celts and Ligures, whose language heritage remains in some local placenames. Rome conquered the region from the local Salassi around 25 BC and founded &quot;Augusta Prætoria Salassorum&quot; (modern-day Aosta) to secure the strategic mountain passes, and they went on to build bridges and roads through the mountains. Thus, the name &quot;Valle d&#x27;Aosta&quot; literally means &quot;Valley of Augustus&quot;.
In 1031–1032, Humbert I of Savoy, the founder of the House of Savoy, received the title &quot;Count of Aosta&quot; from Emperor Conrad II of the Franconian line and built himself a commanding fortification at Bard. Saint Anselm of Canterbury was born in Aosta in 1033 or 1034. The region was divided among strongly fortified castles, and in 1191, Thomas I of Savoy found it necessary to grant to the communes a &quot;Charte des franchises&quot; (&quot;Charter of Liberties&quot;) which preserved autonomy—rights that were fiercely defended until 1770, when they were revoked to tie Aosta more closely to Piedmont, but which were again demanded during post-Napoleonic times. In the mid-13th century, Emperor Frederick II made the County of Aosta a duchy (see Duke of Aosta), and its arms charged with a lion rampant were carried in the Savoy arms until the reunification of Italy in 1870.

The region remained part of Savoy lands, with the exceptions of French occupations from 1539 to 1563, later in 1691, and then between 1704 and 1706. It was also ruled by the First French Empire between 1800 and 1814. During French rule, it was part of Aoste arrondissement in Doire department. As part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, it joined the new Kingdom of Italy in 1861.

French forces briefly controlled the area at the end of World War II, but withdrew under British and American pressure. The region gained special autonomous status after the end of World War II; the province of Aosta ceased to exist in 1945.

==Government and politics==

For decades, the valley has been dominated by autonomist regional parties such as the Valdostan Union, which represents the interests of the French-speaking population. The latest regional election was held in September 2020. On 2 March 2023, Renzo Testolin was elected regional president, supported by a coalition of autonomist and progressive lists.

The Aosta Valley, being the smallest region of Italy by area, is not divided into provinces. Nevertheless, it is still divided into 74 comunes namely:

==Demographics==

The population density of Aosta Valley is by far the lowest of the Italian regions. In 2008, 38.9 inhabitants per km2 were registered in the region, whereas the average national figure was 198.8, though the region has extensive uninhabitable areas of mountain and glacier, with a substantial part of the population living in the central valley.

Negative natural population growth since 1976 has been more than offset by immigration. The region has one of Italy&#x27;s lowest birth rates, with a rising average age. This, too, is partly compensated by immigration, since most immigrants arriving in the region are younger people working in the tourist industry. Between 1991 and 2001, the population of Aosta Valley grew by 3.1%, which is the highest growth among the Italian regions. With a negative natural population growth, this is due exclusively to positive net migration. Between 2001 and 2011, the population of Aosta Valley grew by a further 7.07%. , the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 4,976 foreign-born immigrants live in Aosta Valley, equal to 4.0% of the total regional population.

The Valdôtain population and their language dialects have been the subject of some sociological research.

==Economy==


The economy of the Aosta Valley is based above all on the tertiary sector, in particular on tourism. Due to the autonomy conferred by the special statute, the public sector, which administers most of the regional financial resources, plays a role of primary importance in the Aosta Valley economy. The industries are concentrated in the lower valley (between Verrès-Champdepraz and Pont-Saint-Martin) and are often small to medium sized. However, the contribution of agriculture and livestock to the regional economy is modest. Potatoes, apples, vines, barley are grown and cattle are raised. The artisanal production is significant, in which wooden sculpture emerges.

Aosta Valley has many small and picturesque villages, three of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities. These villages are: 
*Bard
*Fontainemore
*Etroubles

Notable wines include two white wines from Morgex (&quot;Blanc de Morgex et de La Salle&quot; and &quot;Chaudelune&quot;), a red wine blend from Arvier (&quot;Enfer d&#x27;Arvier&quot;) and one from Gamay. The Valle d&#x27;Aosta DOC (or Vallée d&#x27;Aoste DOC, in French) is an Italian &quot;denominazione di origine controllata&quot; located in the Aosta Valley of north-west Italy. Surrounded by the Alps, the Valle d&#x27;Aosta is home to the highest elevated vineyards in all of Europe. The principal winemaking region of the Valle d&#x27;Aosta is found along the eastern banks of the Dora Baltea (fr., &quot;Doire baltée&quot;) river with the city of Aosta serving as the central winemaking location. The region is divided into three main vineyard areas; the upper valley, Valdigne, the central valley (locally &quot;Valle centrale&quot; in Italian, &quot;Vallée centrale&quot; in French) and the lower valley, (locally &quot;Bassa valle&quot; in Italian, &quot;Basse vallée&quot; in French).

==Culture==
===Languages===

The Aosta Valley was the first government authority to adopt Modern French as the official language in 1536, three years before France itself.

Since 1946, Italian and French are the region&#x27;s official languages and are used for the regional government&#x27;s acts and laws, though Italian is the most widespread mother tongue and thus is much more widely spoken in everyday life, while French is mostly spoken in cultural life. Education is conducted evenly in French and Italian, so that anyone who has gone to school in the Aosta Valley can speak both languages to at least a medium-high level.

Legal decree No.365 of 11 November 1946 (art.2) states that it is mandatory to know both Italian and French to teach in Aosta Valley&#x27;s schools. According to Aosta Valley&#x27;s autonomous status (art.39), the same quantity of hours of French and Italian teaching must be held. The decree No.861 of the President of the Republic of 31 October 1975 (art.5) states that it is mandatory to pass a French exam to teach in Aosta Valley for Italian native speakers, as well an Italian exam for French native speakers. Italian law No.196 of 16 May 1978 states the adaptation rules of national educational programmes into French for Aosta Valley, and states as well that all members of the examination boards must be fluent both in Italian and French. Aosta Valley students must pass an extra test in French at the Secondary education final exam, similar to the first test (in Italian).

The regional language, known as &quot;patoué valdotèn&quot; or simply &quot;patoué&quot; (&quot;patois valdôtain&quot; in French), is a dialectal variety of Franco-Provençal. It is spoken as a native and second language by 68,000 residents, or about 58% of the population according to a sociolinguistic survey carried out by the &quot;Fondation Émile Chanoux&quot; in 2001.

The survey found that the Italian language was native to 77.29% of respondents, Franco-Provençal to 17.91%, and French to 1.25%, though the active use of these languages by the population shows French at 75.41% and Franco-Provençal at 55.77%. The population of Gressoney-Saint-Jean, Gressoney-La-Trinité and Issime, in the Lys Valley, speak two dialects of Walser German, Titsch and Töitschu respectively. According to the survey, Walser German was spoken as a mother tongue by 207 people, or 17.78%, in these three villages. Nevertheless, it was known to 56.38% of the population.
===Castles and fortresses===
There are numerous medieval castles and fortified houses in the Aosta Valley, including Châtel-Argent, Saint-Pierre Castle, Fénis Castle, Issogne Castle, Bard Fort, Ussel Castle, Sarre Castle, Cly Castle, Verrès Castle, and Châtelard Castle. Savoy Castle in Gressoney-Saint-Jean was conceived in the 19th century and completed in 1904. Since 1990, it has also been home to the Savoy Castle Alpine Botanical Garden.
===Cuisine===

The cuisine of Aosta Valley is characterized by simplicity and revolves around &quot;robust&quot; ingredients such as potatoes, polenta; cheese and meat; and rye bread. Many of the dishes involve Fontina, a cheese with PDO status, made from cow&#x27;s milk that originates from the valley. It is found in dishes such as the soup &quot;à la vâpeuleunèntse&quot; (Valpelline Soup). Other cheeses made in the region are Tomme de Gressoney and Seras. Fromadzo (Valdôtain for &quot;cheese&quot;) has been produced locally since the 15th century and also has PDO status.

Regional specialities, besides Fontina, are &quot;Motzetta&quot; (dried chamois meat), Vallée d&#x27;Aoste Lard d&#x27;Arnad (a cured and brined fatback product with PDO designation), Vallée d&#x27;Aoste Jambon de Bosses (a kind of ham, likewise with PDO designation), a dark bread made with rye, and honey.

Notable dishes include &quot;Carbonnade&quot;, similar to the Belgian dish of the same name consisting of salt-cured beef cooked with onions and red wine served with polenta; breaded veal cutlets called &quot;costolette&quot;; &quot;teuteuns&quot;, salt-cured cow&#x27;s udder that is cooked and sliced; and &quot;steak à la valdôtaine&quot;, a steak with croûtons, ham and melted cheese.

==Transport==

The main road axes arise in the valley floor. They are the Aosta Valley state road 26 and the Autostrada A5 (Turin-Aosta-Mont Blanc Tunnel). The Mont Blanc Tunnel connects Courmayeur to Chamonix, France. The Great Saint Bernard Pass connects Saint-Rhémy-en-Bosses with Martigny in Switzerland, while the Little Saint Bernard Pass connects the La Thuile valley with the Isère valley and the municipality of Bourg-Saint-Maurice, in France.

The railway line is the Chivasso–Ivrea–Aosta railway, currently undergoing modernization works, the railway service, therefore, will be carried out from January 2024 with replacement buses. The region&#x27;s airport is the Aosta Valley Airport, in Saint-Christophe.

<text>Engine tuning is the adjustment or modification of the internal combustion engine or Engine Control Unit (ECU) to yield optimal performance and increase the engine&#x27;s power output, economy, or durability. These goals may be mutually exclusive; an engine may be de-tuned with respect to output power in exchange for better economy or longer engine life due to lessened stress on engine components.

Tuning can include a wide variety of adjustments and modifications, such as the routine adjustment of the carburetor and ignition system to significant engine overhauls. Performance tuning of an engine can involve revising some of the design decisions taken during the development of the engine.

Setting the idle speed, air-fuel ratio, carburetor balance, spark plug and distributor point gaps, and ignition timing were regular maintenance tasks for older engines and are the final but essential steps in setting up a racing engine. 

On modern engines equipped with electronic ignition and fuel injection, some or all of these tasks are automated but they still require initial calibration of the controls. The ECU handles these tasks, and must be calibrated properly to match the engine&#x27;s hardware.

==Engine tune-up==
The term &quot;tune-up&quot; usually denotes the routine servicing of the engine to meet the manufacturer&#x27;s specifications. Tune-ups are needed periodically according to the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations to ensure the vehicle runs as expected. Modern automobile engines typically require a small number of tune-ups over the course of an approximate or a 10-year, lifespan. This can be attributed to improvements in the production process in which imperfections and errors reduced by computer automation, and significant improvement in the quality of consumables such as the availability of synthetic engine oil.

Tune-ups may include the following:
* Adjustment of the carburetor idle speed and the air-fuel mixture,
* Inspection and possible replacement of ignition system components like spark plugs, contact breaker points, distributor cap and distributor rotor,
* Replacement of the air filter and other filters,
* Inspection of emission controls,
* Valvetrain adjustment.

The term &quot;Italian tuneup&quot; denotes the driving of a performance car, such as a Ferrari, by mechanics finishing the tune-up to burn out any built-up carbon.

==Chip tuning==
Modern engines are equipped with an engine management system (EMS)/Engine Control Unit (ECU) that can be adjusted to different settings, producing different performance levels. Manufacturers often produce a few engines that are used in a wider range of models and platforms. This allows the manufacturers to sell automobiles in various markets with different regulations without having to spend money developing and designing different engines to fit these regulations. This also allows a single engine tuned to suit the particular buyer&#x27;s market to be used by several brands.

==Remapping==

Remapping is the simplest form of stage one engine tuning; it is performed mostly on turbocharged vehicles containing a modern Engine Control Unit (ECU). Almost all modern vehicles have an ECU, primarily supplied by Bosch or Delphi Technologies. The ECU has firmware that controls the various parameters under which the engine runs. These parameters include achieving the appropriate balance between fuel consumption, power, torque, fuel emissions, reliability and service intervals. In seeking this balance, many factories firmware do not prioritise power or torque, which means it is possible to increase the performance of the engine by remapping the ECU.

Many manufacturers build one engine and use several firmware versions, known as maps, to achieve different power levels to differentiate vehicles that essentially have an identical engine. This gives users an opportunity to unlock more power from the engine with a few changes to the factory software by reading and editing the factory firmware from the ECU using specialist tools plugged into the on-board diagnostics (OBD) port. The tools can be connected to the OBD port on any car to read the factory file that is saved on the ECU. Software to read specific types of factory files is available.

Parameters of factory files such as fuel injection, boost pressure, rail pressure, fuel pump pressure and ignition timing, are adjusted to safe limits that are set by an expert so the unlocked performance does not compromise the car&#x27;s safe levels of reliability, fuel consumption and emissions. The map may be customized for city use, for on-track performance, or for an overall map giving power throughout the band in a linear manner. Once adjusted, the edited file is written back to the ECU with the same tools used for the initial reading, after which the engine is tested for performance, smoke levels, and any problems. Fine-tuning is done according to the feedback, producing a better-performing and more efficient engine.

Remapping may increase the temperature of exhaust fumes.

==Performance tuning==

Performance tuning is the tuning of an engine for motorsports. Many such automobiles may never compete but are built for show or leisure driving. In this context, the power output (e.g. In horsepower), torque, and responsiveness of the engine are of premium importance, but reliability and fuel efficiency are also relevant. In races, the engine must be strong enough to withstand the additional stress placed upon it and the automobile must carry sufficient fuel, so it is often far stronger and has higher performance than the mass-produced design on which it may be based. The transmission, driveshaft and other load-transmitting powertrain components may need to be modified to withstand the load from the increased power.

There are many techniques that can be used to increase the power and/or efficiency of an engine. This can be achieved by modifying the air-fuel mixture drawn into the engine, modifying the static or dynamic compression ratio of the engine, modifying the fuel used (e.g. higher octane, different fuel types or chemistries), injection of water or methanol, modifying the timing and dwell of ignition events, and compressing the intake air. Air fuel ratio meters are used to accurately measure the amount of fuel in the mixture. Fuel weight will affect the performance of the car, so fuel economy (thus efficiency) is a competitive advantage.

Ways to increase power include:
* Increasing the engine displacement by one or both of two methods: &quot;boring&quot; - increasing the diameter of the cylinders and pistons, or by &quot;stroking&quot; - using a crankshaft with a greater throw.
* Replacing a stock throttle body with either a larger throttle body (Since it increases airflow due to its larger bore size), an electronic throttle body that opens quickly so that it can access airflow sooner (Which improves throttle response), or a combination of both. 
* Using larger or multiple carburetors to create a more controllable air/fuel mixture to burn and to get it into the engine more smoothly. Fuel injection is more often used in modern engines, and may be modified in a similar manner.
* Increasing the size of the poppet valves in the engine, thus decreasing the restriction in the path of the fuel–air mixture entering the cylinder and the exhaust gases leaving it. Using multiple valves per cylinder results in the same effect, though it is often more difficult to fit several small valves than to have larger, single valves due to the valve gear required. It can also be difficult to find space for one large valve in the inlet and a large valve on the outlet side, and sometimes a large exhaust valve and two smaller inlet valves are fitted.
* Using larger bored, smoother, less-contorted inlet manifold and exhaust manifolds helps maintain the velocity of gases. The ports in the cylinder head can be enlarged and smoothed to match. This is termed cylinder head porting. Manifolds with sharp turns force the air–fuel mix to separate at high velocities because fuel is denser than air.
* The larger bore may extend through the exhaust system using large-diameter piping and low back pressure mufflers, and through the intake system with larger diameter airboxes and high-flow, high-efficiency air filters. Muffler modifications will change the sound of the engine, usually making it louder.
* Increasing the valve opening height (lift) by changing the profiles of the cams on the camshaft or the lever (lift) ratio of the valve rockers in overhead valve (OHV) engines, or cam followers in overhead cam (OHC) engines.
* Optimizing the valve timing to improve burning efficiency; this usually increases power at one range of operating RPM at the expense of reducing it at others. This can usually be achieved by fitting a differently profiled camshaft.
* Raising the compression ratio by reducing the size of the combustion chamber, which makes more efficient use of the cylinder pressure developed and leading to more rapid burning of fuel by using larger compression height pistons or thinner head gaskets or by using a milling machine to &quot;shave&quot; the cylinder head. High compression ratios can cause engine knock unless high-octane fuels are used.
* Forced Induction; adding a turbocharger or a supercharger. The air/fuel mix entering the cylinders is increased by compressing the air. Further gains may be realized by cooling the compressed intake air (compressing air makes it hotter) with an air-to-air or air-to-water intercooler.
* Using a fuel with higher energy content and by adding an oxidizer such as nitrous oxide.
* Using a fuel with better knock suppression characteristics (race fuel, E85, methanol, alcohol) to increase timing advance.
* Reducing losses to friction by machining moving parts to lower tolerances than would be acceptable for production, or by replacing parts. This is done In overhead valve engines by replacing the production rocker arms with replacements incorporating roller bearings in the roller contacting the valve stem.
* Reducing the rotating mass comprised by the crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, and flywheel to improve throttle response due to lower rotational inertia and reduce the vehicle&#x27;s weight by using parts made from alloy instead of steel.
* Changing the tuning characteristics electronically, by changing the firmware of the EMS. This &quot;chip tuning&quot; often works because modern engines are designed to produce more power than required, which is then reduced by the EMS to make the engine operate smoothly over a wider RPM range, with low emissions. This is called de-tuning and produces long-lasting engines and the ability to increase power output later for facelift models. Recently emissions have played a large part in de-tuning, and engines will often be de-tuned to produce a particular carbon output for tax reasons.
* Lowering the underbonnet temperature to lower the engine intake temperature, thus increasing the power. This is often done by installing thermal insulation – normally a heatshield, thermal barrier coating or other type of exhaust heat management – on or around the exhaust manifold. This ensures more heat is diverted from the under-bonnet area.
* Changing the location of the air intake, moving it away from the exhaust and radiator systems to decrease intake temperatures. The intake can be relocated to areas that have higher air pressure due to aerodynamic effects, resulting in effects similar to forced induction.

The choice of modification depends on the degree of performance enhancement desired, budget, and the characteristics of the engine to be modified. Intake, exhaust, and chip upgrades are usually among the first modifications made because they are the cheapest and make reasonably general improvements. A change of camshaft, for instance, requires a compromise between smoothness at low engine speeds and improvements at high engine speeds.

==Definitions==

===Overhaul===
An overhauled engine is one that has been removed, disassembled, cleaned, inspected, repaired as necessary and tested using factory service manual approved procedures. The procedure generally involves honing, new piston rings, bearings, gaskets and oil seals. The engine may be overhauled to &#x27;new limits&#x27; or &#x27;service limits&#x27;, or a combination of the two using used parts, new original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts, or new aftermarket parts. The engine&#x27;s previous operating history is maintained and it is returned with zero hours since major overhaul.

Aftermarket part manufacturers are often the OEM part-suppliers to major engine manufacturers.

A &quot;top overhaul&quot; is composed of the replacement of components inside the cylinder head without removing the engine from the vehicle, such as valve and rocker arm replacement. It may include a &quot;valve job&quot;. A &quot;major overhaul&quot; is composed of the whole engine assembly, which requires the engine to be removed from the vehicle and transferred to an engine stand. A major overhaul costs more than a top overhaul.

&quot;New limits&quot; are the factory service manual&#x27;s approved fits and tolerances to which a new engine is manufactured. This may be accomplished by using &quot;standard&quot; or approved &quot;undersized&quot; and &quot;oversized&quot; tolerances. &quot;Service limits&quot; are the factory service manual&#x27;s allowable wear fits and tolerances that a new-limits part may deteriorate to and still be a usable component. This may also be accomplished using &quot;standard&quot; and approved &quot;undersized&quot; and &quot;oversized&quot; tolerances.

===Remanufactured===

Remanufactured engines are used engines that have been rebuilt to something approximating their manufacturers’ specifications.

A combination of new and used parts are used, with st least the cylinder block being recycled, typically after having been degreased and steam-cleaned, its coolant passages and oil galleries and passages cleaned, and inspected for cracks and other flaws. High-quality rebuilds will include cylinder honing and typically adjust for standard wear by installing as necessary marginally larger bearings, rings, and other similar wear-prone components, new valve springs and guides, lapping valve seats, and otherwise bringing an engine reasonably close to manufacturer specifications. Better yet remanufacturing may see new pistons and the line-boring of worn crankshaft and camshaft bores to permit larger bushings to be installed.

===Blueprinting===

Blueprinting an engine means to build it to exact design specifications, limits and tolerances created by its OEM engineers.

In spite of that definition, the term is often colloquially used for pursuing better-than-factory tolerances and performance, possibly with custom specifications (as for racing). 

Common goals include engine re-manufacturing to achieve the rated power for its manufacturer&#x27;s design, and rebuilding an engine to optimize its performance by adhering to or exceeding exacting manufacturer specifications. Blueprinted components allow for a more exact balancing of reciprocating parts and rotating assemblies so less power is lost through excessive engine vibrations and other mechanical inefficiencies.

When feasible, as with a factory-sponsored race team, blueprinting is performed on components removed from the production line before normal balancing and finishing. Over-machined, under-cast, and deficiently manufactured parts are rejected, and only those either exactly meeting specifications or allowing removal of excess material are selected. Aftermarket and private parties must work with what they have or seek suitable replacements that can be brought to spec, following the same guidelines.

==History==

Modern engine tuning was spawned by the combination of racing advances, the hands-on post-war hot-rod movement, and then-advanced electronics and technologies developed during World War II. 

===Tools===
The &#x27;Igniscope&#x27; electronic ignition tester was produced by English Electric during the 1940s, originally as &#x27;type UED&#x27; for military use during World War II. The post-war version, the &#x27;type ZWA&#x27; electronic ignition tester, was advertised as &quot;the first of its kind, employing an entirely new technique&quot;.

The Igniscope used a cathode-ray tube, giving an entirely visual method of diagnosis. It was invented by D. Napier &amp; Son, a subsidiary of English Electric. The Igniscope was capable of diagnosing latent and actual faults in both coil and magneto ignition systems, including poor battery supply bonding, points and condenser problems, distributor failure and spark-plug gap. One feature was a &quot;loading&quot; control that made latent faults more visible.

The UED manual includes the spark plug firing order of tanks and cars used by the British armed forces.

<text>Ciudad Real (, ; ) is a municipality of Spain located in the autonomous community of Castile–La Mancha, capital of the province of Ciudad Real. It is the 5th most populated municipality in the region.

== History ==
It was founded in 1255 with the name &quot;Villa Real&quot; (&#x27;Royal Town&#x27;) under the auspices of Alfonso X, who granted it a charter that followed the model of Cuenca&#x27;s. It was not founded from scratch, but founded over Pozuelo de San Gil, a hamlet belonging to the land of Alarcos. An independent royal demesne enclave embedded within the dominion of the Military Order of Calatrava, repopulation struggled initially. Weary of the influence of Villa Real, the masters of the Order of Calatrava established a rival market in nearby Miguelturra seeking to disrupt the town&#x27;s economic activity.

Jews soon settled in Villa Real, with the existence of a middle-sized jewry already documented by 1290, only three decades after the foundation of Villa Real.

Friction between Villa Real and the Order of Calatrava reached its climax towards 1323, with an armed conflict between the two parties.

Villa Real hosted the Cortes of Castile in 1346.

The local &quot;aljama&quot; was by and large dismantled upon the 1391 pogroms. The endogenous element of antisemitism was underpinned by the Jews&#x27; deals with the Calatravans throughout the 14th century and their local reputation as loan sharks.

Juan II of Castile granted &quot;Villa Real&quot; the status of city in 1420, thus becoming &quot;Ciudad Real&quot; (&#x27;Royal City&#x27;). The city most probably did not have more than 2000 inhabitants by the time and despite having celebrated Cortes once, the dominant city in the area was still Almagro.
After the unification of the Iberian kingdoms under the Catholic Monarchs, Ciudad Real became the capital of the in 1691. This fact favoured its economic development which was shown by the construction of several important buildings. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake destroyed many of these buildings. In 1809, during the Peninsular War, French troops defeated the Spanish army and occupied the town, using the local hospital as their headquarters and barracks.

Following the creation of the province of Ciudad Real as per the 1833 territorial division, the status of provincial capital of Ciudad Real was challenged by the cities of Almagro and Manzanares, with a similar population by the mid-nineteenth century. However the initiatives intending to take the provincial capital out of Ciudad Real did not succeed.

Much of the centre was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===

Ciudad Real is located in the southern half of the Inner Plateau, in the central part of the Iberian Peninsula, at about 625 metres above sea level.

The city is part of the Campo de Calatrava natural region, a transitional region between the &quot;Montes&quot; and La Mancha, remarkable in the context of the Iberian Peninsula because of its volcanic origin. The plaza del Pilar is precisely built on the centre of a shallow volcanic maar. As Ciudad Real itself was the capital of the province of La Mancha in the 18th century, the whole province of Ciudad Real is often considered as part of La Mancha in a wider sense.

The location of Ciudad Real—without any major water stream passing through the city—leaves the Guadiana to the North and the (a left-bank tributary of the former) to the South.

The urban nucleus was founded 7.5 km to the North-East of Alarcos (a fortified archeological site located on a hill). Despite enjoying a location at the crossroads of the Madrid–Andalusia and the Levante–Portugal corridors, the city did not particularly prosper historically thanks to this circumstance. The city currently forms a near urban continuum with neighbouring Miguelturra.

=== Climate ===
The city has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;), with cool winters (due to its altitude) and hot to very hot dry summers. Like many other cities of Castilla-La-Mancha, the precipitation is limited throughout the year. It has one of the highest annual temperature ranges in the Iberian Peninsula, exceeding .

The precipitation in the Campo de Calatrava is sparse, with a high year-to-year variability and the area features high levels of evapotranspiration, particularly in Summer.


== Sports ==

The city previously had a handball team, the BM Ciudad Real, which was the winner of the handball EHF Champions League in 2006, 2008 and 2009.

The handball club was one of the best in the world and its home arena, the Don Quixote Arena, was one of the biggest in the Spanish professional league. BM Ciudad Real, however, moved its team to Madrid in 2011; renamed as &quot;Atlético Madrid&quot;, it dissolved in 2013.

==Transport==
The city has a railway station on a high-speed rail line, the Ciudad Real railway station. 

A high-capacity airport (Ciudad Real Central Airport) was built in the city, but closed in 2012. The privately funded airport cost an estimated €1 billion to build, and was for sale for €100 million plus payment of the developer&#x27;s debt. In July 2014 this was reduced to €80 million in a further attempt to find a buyer.
In July 2015 the airport was auctioned to the lone bidder, Chinese company Tzaneen International offering €10,000.

The airport was reopened on 12 September 2019.

The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Ciudad Real, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 33 min. 3% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 8 min, while 1% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 2 km, while 0% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

== Main sights ==

The Plaza Mayor sits in the centre of Ciudad Real. Today, only two parts of the wall that surrounded the city in medieval times remain standing: The Toledo Gate.
Don Quixote&#x27;s Museum is situated next to Parque de Gasset.

The Museo Elisa Cendreros exhibits an old collection of fans and carved wood.

The Ermita de Alarcos is the oldest church in Ciudad Real. The Iglesia of Santiago is also the most beautiful and oldest church in Ciudad Real, it was built at the end of the 13th century in romanic style. Its style is Gothic. It is decorated with gothic paintings and with seven-headed dragons, the ceiling is decorated with stones forming eight pointed stars.

Another important church in Ciudad Real is Iglesia de San Pedro (Church of Saint Peter). It is the most interesting and typical monument of the city. It was built during the 14th and 15th centuries. Its style is Gothic, and it houses the tomb of Chantre de Coca, confessor and chaplain of the Catholic Monarchs.

Ciudad Real Cathedral, built in the 16th century, has the second-largest nave in Spain and a magnificent Baroque altarpiece.

== Education ==

Ciudad Real has 24 primary schools and 6 secondary schools.

The high school &quot;Torreón del Alcázar&quot; was founded in 1987. In the first years there were only vocational studies, thirty teachers and 350 students. Some years later the high school incorporated the compulsory secondary studies and A levels. At the moment there are 80 teachers and 1200 students. In the year 1995 the high school was offered the opportunity to become a bilingual school. In the year 2005 the first bilingual group arrived.

See University of Castilla–La Mancha (UCLM), Campus of Ciudad Real.

== Events ==
One of the most popular festivals in the city is &quot;La Pandorga&quot;, which takes place July 30 and 31. On the last day of the month the festival honours its patroness, &quot;La Virgen del Prado&quot;. The usual attire of the participants consists of jeans, a white shirt, and the traditional handkerchief.

<text>Ciudad Real is a province in the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha, Spain, that is divided into 102 municipalities. Spanish census, the province is the 31st largest by population, with inhabitants, and the 3rd largest by land area, spanning . Municipalities are the basic local political division in Spain and can only belong to one province. They enjoy a large degree of autonomy in their local administration, being in charge of tasks such as urban planning, water supply, lighting, roads, local police, and firefighting.

The organisation of municipalities in Spain is outlined in a local government law (; ) passed on 2 April 1985 and finalised by an 18 April 1986 royal decree. The Statute of Autonomy of Castilla–La Mancha also contains provisions concerning the relations between the municipalities and the autonomous government of Castilla–La Mancha. All citizens of Spain are required to register in the municipality in which they reside. Each municipality is a corporation with independent legal personhood: its governing body is called the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; (municipal council or corporation), a term often also used to refer to the municipal offices (city and town halls). The &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; is composed of the mayor (), the deputy mayors (&quot;tenientes de alcalde&quot;) and the plenary assembly (&quot;pleno&quot;) of councillors (&quot;concejales&quot;). Municipalities are categorised by population for the purpose of determining the number of councillors: three when the population is up to 100 inhabitants, five for 101250, seven for 2511,000, nine for 1,0012,000, eleven for 2,0015,000, thirteen for 5,00110,000, seventeen for 10,00120,000, twenty-one for 20,00150,000, and twenty-five for 50,001100,000.

The mayor and the deputy mayors are elected by the plenary assembly, which is itself elected by universal suffrage. Elections in municipalities with more than 250 inhabitants are carried out following a proportional representation system with closed lists, whilst those with a population lower than 250 use a block plurality voting system with open lists. The plenary assembly must meet periodically at the seat of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot;, with meetings occurring more or less frequently depending on the population of the municipality: monthly for those whose population is larger than 20,000, once every two months if it ranges between 5,001 and 20,000, and once every three months if it does not exceed 5,000. Many &quot;ayuntamientos&quot; also have a local governing board (), which is named by the mayor from amongst the councillors and is required for municipalities of more than 5,000 inhabitants. The board, whose role is to assist the mayor between meetings of the plenary assembly, may not include more than one third of the councillors.

The largest municipality by population in the province as of the 2023 Spanish census is Ciudad Real, its capital, with 75,254 residents, while the smallest is Villar del Pozo, with 55 residents. The largest municipality by area is Almodóvar del Campo, which spans 1,207.90 km², while Caracuel de Calatrava is the smallest at 9.92 km².

<doc id="301313" wikidata="Q1059780" url="?curid=301313" title="JET Programme">
<text>The , shortly as , is a teaching program sponsored by the Japanese government that brings university graduates to Japan as Assistant Language Teachers (ALTs), Sports Education Advisors (SEAs) or as Coordinators for International Relations (CIRs) in local governments and boards of education.

JET is one of the world&#x27;s largest international exchange programmes. Since 1987, more than 77,000 people from 77 countries have participated in JET. As of July 1, 2024, 5,861 participants from 51 countries were employed on the programme.

Holders of Japanese passports may participate in the programme, but must renounce their Japanese citizenship to do so. The focus of the programme as stated on the JET Programme website is &quot;to promote internationalization in Japan&#x27;s local communities by improving foreign language education and fostering international exchange at the community level.&quot; The JET Programme is not looking and/or hiring teachers but rather looking for cultural ambassadors to assist in foreign language education taught by Japanese Teachers of English. About 90% of the participants on the programme are ALTs; the remaining 10% are divided between CIRs and SEAs. The number of alumni totalled over 57,000 from 54 countries in 2013.

==History and Aims==
In August 1987, the Monbusho English Fellows Program and the British English Teachers Scheme were merged to form the JET Programme. The English Teaching Recruitment Programme was started in 1978 and initially was exclusively for British university graduates. This programme became known as the &quot;British English Teachers Scheme&quot;. American teaching assistants were added under the &quot;Monbusho English Fellows Program&quot; beginning in 1977. As more countries were included, the programmes were folded into a single entity in 1987, creating the JET Programme.

It offers university graduates positions for full-time jobs as either an Assistant Language Teacher (ALT) in elementary and secondary schools, a Sports Exchange Advisor (SEA) whose role is to assist with sports training and the planning of sports related projects, or a Coordinator for International Relations (CIR) in selected local government offices in Japan. Its aims were revised to &quot;increase mutual understanding between the people of Japan and the people of other nations, to promote internationalisation in Japan&#x27;s local communities by helping to improve foreign language education, and to develop international exchange at the community level&quot;. The total number of JET participants steadily decreased from a high of 6,273 in 2002 down to 4,330 in 2011 before stabilizing. The total number of JETs&#x27; is 5,528, as of July 2018.

==Administrative details==
The programme is run by three ministries: the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) in conjunction with local authorities. The programme is administered by CLAIR (the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations), and has an annual budget of over 45 billion yen (US$400 million).

There is an organization called The Association of Japan Exchange and Teaching (AJET) that provides support for the Programme participants and facilitates communication with the JET Programme sponsors. AJET organises events and has a number of publications to assist with teaching in Japan. Some notable publications include Planet Eigo (replacement for Team Taught Pizza) and Foxy Phonics. AJET is not an official JET organization, and it has no official ties with CLAIR.

==Application process==
#Applicants must:
#* hold a Bachelor&#x27;s degree (in any subject);
#* be a citizen of the country where the recruitment and selection procedures take place;
#* not possess Japanese citizenship
#* have excellent skills in the designated language (both written and spoken). (English or for non-English speaking countries English or the principal language);
#* have a keen interest in the country and culture of Japan;
#* not have lived in Japan for 6 or more years after 2000, nor be a former participant in the programme after 2007.
# Prospective participants must submit a detailed application including a statement of purpose and self-reported medical form, usually in November or December of the year before their departure.
# Those who pass stage one of the process are invited to interviews which are conducted in major cities, usually in February. Although applications are accepted from people living in Japan, there are no interviews offered in-country. Applicants must interview in their home country. Interviews are conducted in English or in the language of applicant&#x27;s country, but part of the interview will be conducted in Japanese if the applicant indicated Japanese ability on their application, or if they are a CIR applicant. The interview is normally conducted by a panel of three people, consisting of former JETs and members of Japanese government, embassy, and consulate organizations. The interviews last approximately 20 minutes. Interviewees are then offered a position, rejected, or become &quot;Alternates&quot; (who may participate if positions become available).
# Once offered a position, applicants must formally submit their acceptance or rejection of the offer. In addition, they must provide the results of a recent physical examination, performed by a physician within the last three months. Finally, they must submit detailed contact information so that the programme can send them materials and information as the departure date draws nearer.
# Participants usually learn of their placement details during May through July just before their departure date of very late July (Group A) or very early August (Group B). Alternates may receive very short notice, sometimes only a few weeks, if a placement becomes available. A small group of alternates usually arrives together in late August (Group C) and other individual alternates arrive at other times throughout the fall. Applicants who withdraw from the program &quot;after&quot; receiving placement notification are ineligible to reapply the following year. Applicants are required to depart in a group from the city in which they were interviewed, although rare exceptions are made. This is usually the Japanese embassy or consulate that serves the applicant&#x27;s home town, though it could theoretically be any site in the same country that the applicant submits on his or her application. Air fares are arranged by the programme.

Participants are also required to attend pre-departure and post-arrival orientations as well as annual mid-year conferences, and may attend a returnee conference during their tenure.

Participants are placed with a local authority in Japan (the Contracting Organization) which is the employer. There are 47 prefectural governments and 12 city governments, as well as numerous individual city, town and village governments and some private schools designated as Contracting Organisations. While applicants can specify up to three preferred locations, and can request urban, semi-rural or rural placements, they may be placed anywhere in Japan, and placements may not match requests.

Participants sign a one-year contract, which can be renewed up to four times, for a maximum of five years. Some contracting organizations offer the option of contracting for a total of five years, although some prohibit contracting beyond three years. Before 2006, participants could only contract for up to three years, with the exception of a few positions.

Participants who began their tenure on the program in 2011 or earlier received a salary of ¥3,600,000 per year after tax. Participants beginning in 2012 or later are paid on a new salary scale: &quot;3.36 million yen for the first appointment, 3.6 million yen for the second appointment, 3.9 million yen for the third appointment, and for those appointed for a fourth and fifth year, 3.96 million yen for each year&quot;. Additionally, this salary is pre-tax (as opposed to post-tax prior to 2011), so participants who are liable for income or residential taxes in Japan must pay taxes.

Participants receive paid airfare to and from Japan paid by the Japanese government, and may receive other benefits such as housing subsidies. Participants are generally forbidden to take paid work outside of their Programme duties.

==Assistant Language Teacher responsibilities==
* Assisting English classes taught by Japanese Teachers of English in junior and senior high schools.
* Assisting with English language training activities at primary/elementary schools
* Assisting in the preparation of materials for English language teaching
* Assisting in the language training of Japanese Teachers of English
* Assisting in organizing, coordinating and preparing activities for extracurricular activities and clubs
* Providing information on language and other related subjects to Teachers&#x27; Consultants and Japanese Teachers of English (e.g. word usage, pronunciations, etc.)
* Assisting in English Language speech contests. Engaging in local international exchange activities.

== Participation==
The majority of JET participants have historically come from predominantly English speaking countries. For example, of the 4,476 participants in 2014, about half were from the United States (2,457), Canada (495), the United Kingdom (383), Australia (315), New Zealand (255), South Africa (93), and Ireland (86). 
==Appointment renewal==

JET participants partake in the programme for a minimum of one year, with a maximum stay of three years (two renewal cycles). A small percentage of exceptional participant JETs are elected to stay for the maximum number of consecutive appointments—a sum of four renewal cycles for a total of five years maximum ALT/CIR experience.

==Developments==
Some JET participants in recent years have been placed in elementary schools, reflecting MEXT&#x27;s plan to raise the English ability of Japanese students. Some contracting organizations go further and have ALTs periodically work with kindergarten students teaching basic English vocabulary through games and activities. This also brings them exposure to non-Japanese people. Participants occasionally also teach in special schools.

Several prefectures have opted out of the JET Programme in recent years. Some hire individuals directly through advertising or word of mouth recommendation while others use an intermediary dispatch company—usually one of the big English schools such as Heart, Interac, or Altia. While direct-hired employees may obtain working conditions similar to the JET Programme, those employed by dispatch companies often have very different working contracts—unpaid holidays or pay-by-the-day contracts are not uncommon. Some dispatch methods used by certain Boards of Education have even been declared illegal by Japanese labor standards authorities (see Assistant Language Teacher).

Since 1998, the Hong Kong government has operated a similar program, known as the Native English-speaking Teacher scheme, which employs about 800 teachers. Korea has also implemented a similar program called EPIK (English Program in Korea).

From 2007, the possible stay for some JET participants was extended from three years to five years, subject to certain stipulations. JET participants in their third year are able to re-contract two more times if their work performance, accomplishments and abilities are deemed outstanding by their contracting organization. However, as in most JET matters, the application process is decided upon by the individual contracting organization.

From 2009, it became possible to apply for an April start. This option does not exclude the applicant from being considered from the traditional August start. Successful applicants starting in April are notified in early March (this notice includes their placement). The April start is in line with the start of the Japanese school year.

In May 2010, the JET programme came up for review by the Government Revitalization Unit, the &quot;jigyōshiwake&quot; budget review panel, due to the need to cut costs given the state of the economy of Japan. However, the subsequent LDP administration of Shinzō Abe in fact announced its likely expansion.

In February 2012, &quot;The Japan Times&quot; alleged that one contracting Board of Education had fraudulently deducted payments from JET participants and harassed whistle-blowers of the practice.

In January 2019, &quot;Medium&quot; posted a report on an incident that involved a Board of Education attempting to cover up an incident of sexual assault concerning two members of the JET Programme. This bought awareness of similar events over the years in the programme. Those involved, claim that JET has vowed to increase their support for JETs in the future and to work closer with Boards of Education, however, no official statement has been made by JET. In December 2020 it was reported in the Japanese media that the plaintiff was now seeking legal redress and damages from the Nagasaki Prefectural Government.

<text>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test is a 1968 nonfiction book by Tom Wolfe written in the New Journalism literary style. By 1970, this style began to be referred to as Gonzo journalism, a term coined for the work of Hunter S. Thompson. The book presents a firsthand account of the experiences of Ken Kesey and a group of psychedelic enthusiasts, known as the Merry Pranksters, who traveled across the United States in a colorfully-painted school bus they called &quot;Furthur&quot;. Kesey and the Pranksters became famous for their use of psychedelic drugs (such as LSD) to achieve expansion of their consciousness. The book chronicles the Acid Tests (parties with LSD-laced Kool-Aid) and encounters with notable figures of the time (Hells Angels, Grateful Dead, Allen Ginsberg), and describes Kesey&#x27;s exile to Mexico and his arrests.

== Plot ==
Wolfe chronicles the adventures of Ken Kesey and his group of followers. Throughout the work, Kesey is portrayed as seeking to create a new religion. Kesey gathers a group of followers based on the allure of transcendence achievable through drugs, as well as his ability to preach and captivate listeners. The group was labelled as the &quot;Merry Pranksters&quot; and participated in a drug-fueled lifestyle. The &quot;Acid Tests&quot; — parties centered around LSD-laced Kool-Aid and carried out with lights and noise intended to enhance the psychedelic experience — started at Kesey&#x27;s house in the woods of La Honda, California.

The Pranksters eventually leave the confines of Kesey&#x27;s estate and travel across the country in a bus called &quot;Furthur&quot;. The bus is driven by Neal Cassady, who was the inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty in Jack Kerouac&#x27;s 1957 novel &quot;On the Road&quot;. Throughout the journey, the individuals on the bus take acid frequently. As the Merry Pranksters gain popularity, Kesey&#x27;s reputation develops as well. Towards the middle of the book, Kesey is idolized as the hero of a growing counterculture. Alongside this, Kesey forms friendships with groups like the Hells Angels, and crosses paths with icons of the Beat Generation. His growing popularity provides Kesey and the Pranksters opportunities to meet other significant members of the growing counterculture, including the Grateful Dead, Allen Ginsberg and attempt to meet with Timothy Leary. The failed meeting with Leary marks a greater failure to unite the counterculture from East to West coasts. This becomes one of the turning points in the book, indicating that the new generation of “hippies” had officially outpaced the old Beat Generation in style and philosophy.

In an effort to broadcast their lifestyle, the Pranksters publicize their acid experiences giving rise to the term &quot;Acid Test&quot;. They describe the goal of these parties as the pursuit of &quot;intersubjectivity,&quot; a state beyond an individual&#x27;s ego. As the Acid Tests are catching on culturally, Kesey is arrested for possession of marijuana. In an effort to avoid jail, he flees to Mexico and is joined by the Pranksters. The Pranksters struggle in Mexico and are unable to obtain the same results from their acid trips.

Kesey and some of the Pranksters return to the United States. At this point, Kesey becomes a full-blown pop culture icon as he appears on TV and radio shows, despite being wanted by the FBI. Eventually, he is located and arrested. Kesey is conditionally released as he convinces the judge that the next step of his movement is an &quot;Acid Test Graduation,&quot; an event in which the Pranksters and other followers will attempt to achieve intersubjectivity without the use of mind-altering drugs. The graduation is not effective enough to clear the charges from Kesey&#x27;s name. He is given two sentences for two separate offenses. He is designated to a work camp to fulfill his sentence. He moves his wife and children to Oregon and begins serving his time in the forests of California.

== Cultural significance and reception ==

&quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; has been described as faithful and &quot;essential&quot; in depicting the roots and growth of the hippie movement.

The New Journalism literary style is seen to have elicited either fascination or incredulity by its audience. While &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; was not the original standard for New Journalism, it is the most-often cited work of that genre. Wolfe&#x27;s descriptions and accounts of the adventures of Kesey and his cohort were influential on the cultural perception of the figures and events in the book. Wolfe&#x27;s style is particularly characteristic of New Journalism as he invites the reader to view the work as fiction rather than reportage. 

The book received modest literary acclaim, in particular for the clear narrative Wolfe maintained amidst the indulgent and often intoxicated milieu depicted. Despite Wolfe&#x27;s immersion within Kesey&#x27;s &quot;movement&quot; and advocacy of Kesey&#x27;s and the Pranksters&#x27; ideology, he renders sober portrayals of their experiences as being triggered by both paranoia and the acid trips which had become the group&#x27;s cultural motif. Wolfe chronicles the Pranksters&#x27; day-to-day lives and numerous psychedelic experiences and his abstinence usefully differentiates his point of view. Wolfe endeavors to depict the Pranksters and Kesey within their environment and as he believes they themselves wished to be seen.

While some saw New Journalism as the future of literature, the concept was not without criticism. There were many who challenged the believability of the style and there were many questions and criticisms about whether accounts were true. However, Wolfe challenged such claims and notes that in books like &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;, he was nearly invisible throughout the narrative. He argues that he produced an uninhibited account of the events he witnessed. As proponents of fiction and orthodox nonfiction continued to question the validity of New Journalism, Wolfe stood by the growing discipline. Wolfe thought that this method of writing transformed the subjects of newspapers and articles into people with whom audiences could relate and sympathize.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; considered the book one of the great works of its time, and one writer described it as not only a great book about hippies, but the &quot;essential book&quot;. The review continued to explore the dramatic impacts of Wolfe&#x27;s telling of Kesey&#x27;s story. Wolfe&#x27;s book exposed counterculture norms that would soon spread across the country. The review notes that while Kesey received acclaim for his literary effort &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, he was, for the most part, not a visible icon. His experiments and drug use were known within small circles, such as the Pranksters. Wolfe&#x27;s accounts of Kesey and the Pranksters brought their ideologies and drug use into mainstream discussion. A separate review maintained that Wolfe&#x27;s book was as vital to the hippie movement as Norman Mailer&#x27;s 1968 book &quot;The Armies of the Night&quot; was to the anti-Vietnam movement.

In addition to the praise that &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; received from some outlets, the book has received criticism for its stylistic representations of counterculture and drug use. A review in &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; identified the effects of the book, but did so without offering praise. The review, written by Jay Cantor, who went on to literary prominence himself, provides a more moderate description of Kesey and his Pranksters. Cantor challenges Wolfe&#x27;s messiah-like depiction of Kesey, concluding that &quot;In the end the Christ-like robes Wolfe fashioned for Kesey are much too large. We are left with another acidhead and a bunch of kooky kids who did a few krazy things.&quot; Cantor explains how Kesey was offered the opportunity by a judge to speak to the masses and curb the use of LSD. Kesey, who Wolfe idolizes for starting the movement, is left powerless in his opportunity to alter the movement. Cantor is also critical of Wolfe&#x27;s praise for the rampant abuse of LSD. Cantor admits the impact of Kesey in this scenario, stating that the drug was in fact widespread by 1969, when he wrote his criticism. He questions the glorification of such drug use however, challenging the ethical attributes of reliance on such a drug, and further asserts that &quot;LSD is no respecter of persons, of individuality&quot;.

Asked in 1989 by Terry Gross on &quot;Fresh Air&quot; what he thought of the book, Kesey replied,

It&#x27;s a good book. yeah, he&#x27;s a — Wolfe&#x27;s a genius. He did a lot of that stuff, he was only around three weeks. He picked up that amount of dialogue and verisimilitude without a tape recorder, without taking notes to any extent. He just watches very carefully and remembers. But, you know, he&#x27;s got his own editorial filter there. And so, what he&#x27;s coming up with is part of me, but it&#x27;s not all of me...&quot;

=== Plans for a film adaptation ===
The project for a movie adaptation of Wolfe&#x27;s book seems to have stalled. Entrepreneur Alfred Roven purchased the film rights shortly after the book was published, passing them to his children before his death, who entrusted them to Richard N. Gladstein after they were introduced to him by their attorney. Gladstein hired Gus Van Sant (who had dedicated his 2002 film &quot;Gerry&quot; to Kesey) to direct, and then Dustin Lance Black to screenwrite. Gustin Nash was later hired for rewrites. In 2011, Van Sant said that he was still working on the film, but had yet to find a way to get the project working.

<text>The Southern Federal District () is one of the eight federal districts of Russia. Its territory lies mostly on the Pontic–Caspian steppe of Southern Russia. The Southern Federal District shares borders with Ukraine, the Azov Sea, and the Black Sea in the west, and Kazakhstan and the Caspian Sea in the east.

==History==
The Southern Federal District was originally called the North Caucasian Federal District when it was founded on 13 May 2000, but was renamed for political reasons on 21 June 2000. On 19 January 2010, the Southern Federal District was split in two, with its former southern territories forming a new North Caucasian Federal District.

On 28 July 2016, Crimean Federal District (which contains the Republic of Crimea and the Federal city of Sevastopol) was abolished and merged into Southern Federal District in order to &quot;improve the governance&quot;. Crimean Federal District was established on 21 March 2014 after the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. The federal district includes both the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol, both recognized as part of Ukraine by most of the international community. Ukraine considers the area, along with the areas of Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic, the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic, Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhzhia Oblast, as temporarily occupied territories. Its population was 13,854,334 (62.4% urban) according to the 2010 Census, living in an area of .

==Demographics==
===Federal constituent entities===

An official government translation of the constitution of Russia from Russian to English uses the term &quot;constituent entities of the Russian Federation&quot;. For example, Article 5 reads: &quot;The Russian Federation shall consist of republics, krays, oblasts, cities of federal significance, an autonomous oblast and autonomous okrugs, which shall have equal rights as constituent entities of the Russian Federation.&quot; A translation provided by Garant-Internet instead uses the term &quot;subjects of the Russian Federation&quot;.

Tom Fennell, a translator, told the 2008 American Translators Association conference that &quot;constituent entity of the Russian Federation&quot; is a better translation than &quot;subject&quot;. This was supported by Tamara Nekrasova, Head of Translation Department at Goltsblat BLP, saying in a 2011 presentation at a translators conference that &quot;&quot;constituent entity of the Russian Federation&quot; is more appropriate than &quot;subject of the Russian Federation&quot; (&quot;subject&quot; would be OK for a monarchy)&quot;.

<doc id="301329" wikidata="Q206120" url="?curid=301329" title="Lung volumes and capacities">
<text>Lung volumes and lung capacities are measures of the volume of air in the lungs at different phases of the respiratory cycle.

The average total lung capacity of an adult human male is about 6 litres of air.

Tidal breathing is normal, resting breathing; the tidal volume is the volume of air that is inhaled or exhaled in only a single such breath.

The average human respiratory rate is 30–60 breaths per minute at birth, decreasing to 12–20 breaths per minute in adults.

==Factors affecting volumes==
Several factors affect lung volumes; some can be controlled, and some cannot be controlled. Lung volumes vary with different people as follows:

A person who is born and lives at sea level will develop a slightly smaller lung capacity than a person who spends their life at a high altitude. This is because the partial pressure of oxygen is lower at higher altitude which, as a result means that oxygen less readily diffuses into the bloodstream. In response to higher altitude, the body&#x27;s diffusing capacity increases in order to process more air. Also, due to the lower environmental air pressure at higher altitudes, the air pressure within the breathing system must be lower in order to inhale; in order to meet this requirement, the thoracic diaphragm has a tendency to lower to a greater extent during inhalation, which in turn causes an increase in lung volume.

When someone living at or near sea level travels to locations at high altitudes (e.g. the Andes; Denver, Colorado; Tibet; the Himalayas) that person can develop a condition called altitude sickness because their lungs remove adequate amounts of carbon dioxide but they do not take in enough oxygen. (In normal individuals, carbon dioxide is the primary determinant of respiratory drive.)

Lung function development is reduced in children who grow up near motorways although this seems at least in part reversible. Air pollution exposure affects FEV1 in asthmatics, but also affects FVC and FEV1 in healthy adults even at low concentrations.

Specific changes in lung volumes also occur during pregnancy. Functional residual capacity drops 18–20%, typically falling from 1.7 to 1.35 litres, due to the compression of the diaphragm by the uterus. The compression also causes a decreased total lung capacity (TLC) by 5% and decreased expiratory reserve volume by 20%. Tidal volume increases by 30–40%, from 0.5 to 0.7 litres, and minute ventilation by 30–40% giving an increase in pulmonary ventilation. This is necessary to meet the increased oxygen requirement of the body, which reaches 50 ml/min, 20 ml of which goes to reproductive tissues. Overall, the net change in maximum breathing capacity is zero.

==Values==


The &quot;tidal volume&quot;, &quot;vital capacity&quot;, &quot;inspiratory capacity&quot; and &quot;expiratory reserve volume&quot; can be measured directly with a spirometer. These are the basic elements of a ventilatory &quot;pulmonary function test&quot;.

Determination of the &quot;residual volume&quot; is more difficult as it is impossible to &quot;completely&quot; breathe out. Therefore, measurement of the residual volume has to be done via indirect methods such as radiographic planimetry, body plethysmography, closed circuit dilution (including the helium dilution technique) and nitrogen washout.

In absence of such, estimates of &quot;residual volume&quot; have been prepared as a proportion of body mass for infants (18.1 ml/kg), or as a proportion of &quot;vital capacity&quot; (0.24 for men and 0.28 for women) or in relation to height and age ((0.0275* Age [Years]+0.0189*Height [cm]−2.6139) litres for normal-mass individuals and (0.0277*Age [Years]+0.0138*Height [cm]−2.3967) litres for overweight individuals). Standard errors in prediction equations for residual volume have been measured at 579 ml for men and 355 ml for women, while the use of 0.24*FVC gave a standard error of 318 ml.

Online calculators are available that can compute predicted lung volumes, and other spirometric parameters based on a patient&#x27;s age, height, weight, and ethnic origin for many reference sources.

British rower and three-time Olympic gold medalist Pete Reed is reported to hold the largest recorded lung capacity of 11.68 litres; US swimmer Michael Phelps is also said to have a lung capacity of around 12 litres.

=== Weight of breath ===
The mass of one breath is approximately a gram (0.5-5 g). A litre of air weighs about 1.2 g (1.2 kg/m3). A half litre ordinary tidal breath weighs 0.6 g; a maximal 4.8 litre breath (average vital capacity for males) weighs approximately 5.8 g.

==Restrictive and obstructive==

The results (in particular FEV1/FVC and FRC) can be used to distinguish between restrictive and obstructive pulmonary diseases:

<doc id="301343" wikidata="Q4808960" url="?curid=301343" title="Assistant Language Teacher">
<text>An Assistant Language Teacher (ALT) is a foreign national serving as an assistant teacher (paraprofessional educator) in a classroom in Japan, particularly for English as a second language.

The role was created by the Japanese Ministry of Education at the time of the creation of the JET Programme as a translation of the term 外国語指導助手 (&quot;gaikokugo shidō joshu&quot;) or literally &quot;foreign language instruction assistant&quot;. The terms AET (Assistant English Teacher), ELT (English Language Teacher) and NESA (Native English Speaking Assistant) are also in use. The term is used by the Ministry of Education, local Boards of Education (BOE) and schools in Japan primarily to refer to English language speakers who assist with teaching of English in elementary, junior high and senior high schools. However, some ALTs help teach languages other than English.

ALTs are typically required to be university graduates, but they are usually not certified teachers like their Japanese colleagues. In addition to a degree, ALTs are also required to either be native English speakers, or provide proof of learning the language for a specified period of time, usually at least five years.

==Being an ALT==
===Requirements===
The JET Programme set the general prerequisites imposed by Japanese immigration (bachelor&#x27;s degree, health, nationality) and the characteristics that can be considered to be sought by the Japanese government, boards of education (BOEs), and schools.

In the case of ALTs from private language teaching companies, further requirements may include items such as TEFL certification, Japanese language ability (at least spoken) at a communicative level, teaching experience (both within Japan and in other countries) and other specialized skills (foreign languages other than English, IT, etc.) However, as a basic rule, the standards that are expected of JET Programme are still considered as norms among private language teaching companies that provide ALTs to BOEs, although agreements between BOEs and private companies often allow for a relaxing on some of these rules.

===Recruitment===
At one time, the majority of ALTs were recruited through the JET Programme, but now most are hired by private language teaching companies, also known as &quot;dispatch companies&quot;, either within Japan or abroad. Once hired, ALTs are sent to work in junior and senior high-schools and, increasingly, in elementary schools throughout Japan. ALTs are either assigned to one main school, or can work at a number of different schools in their area. ALTs entering on the JET programme are not required to have any prior teaching experience or ESL training. Many ALTs hired privately have prior experience and/or training.

ALTs hired on the JET Programme typically enter either in July or August, but most private ALTs are usually on a contract which runs from April until at least the end of the third school term in March. Some AETs dispatched to City of Nagoya public schools have contracts that begin in mid-May and end in mid-February. Some ALTs also have set, paid holidays during the spring, summer and winter school vacations, in addition to all Japanese public holidays, but some ALTs are not paid between semesters or for national holidays, and do not receive paid vacation leave. By combining the 23 national holidays with the time off during school holidays, the actual number of working days per year is somewhere near 200 through private companies, which is one of the major attractions of the ALT position, however many schools require you to undertake other tasks when not teaching, so the actual hours worked are similar to other jobs in Japan. Most JET Programme ALTs are required to work through the school holidays, receiving the 23 national holidays plus annual leave as holiday time.

===Payment===
The pay for a private ALT is usually less than a full-time Eikaiwa teacher and far less than a teacher from the JET Programme (¥3.36 to ¥3.96 million depending on year in the program), with some of the lowest salaries around ¥180,000 per month (¥2.16 million annually).

===Job duties===
An ALT&#x27;s primary duty is to assist Japanese teachers of English to deliver lessons in the classroom, and may be involved in lesson planning and other language teaching tasks. Regarding Elementary school, the term ALT is often misleading, in many instances the ALT leads the class themselves, and may solely be responsible for total lesson planning (for the academic year and delivering the lessons). This is mostly the case with Elementary schools outside of the Kanto region. During such lessons, Japanese teachers often act as a support teacher or translator. In those instances the term &quot;Assistant&quot; Language Teacher becomes unsuitable, as the ALT is not &quot;assisting&quot; but actually &quot;leading and facilitating&quot; the entire English class. However, in Junior Highschool and Highschool, the degree to which the Japanese teacher of English actually uses the ALT is usually decided at the discretion of the Japanese teacher. Some allow ALTs to plan and lead language activities in class, sometimes for the entire class period, while others make minimal use of their ALT, such as limiting them to reading new vocabulary words for the students to repeat and having the ALT walk between the rows of students while the students do writing assignments. An ALT also contributes information to teaching advisors on phraseology and pronunciation.

ALTs usually take part in three to five classes per day. The classes are usually 45 – 50 minutes in length. An ALT participates in about 17 to 20 classes per week. Sometimes ALTs are asked to help teach special education classes, which may include students who have barriers to learning. They may also be asked to take part in after/before school club activities (&quot;bukatsudō&quot;), such as sports, calligraphy, music or ikebana, to learn more about the culture alongside their students and to foster international exchange. However, some ALTs choose not to participate, or go from group to group just to visit. The English level of the students varies from school to school, and at some schools the students and teachers are unable to communicate in English in any meaningful way. Higher level high schools sometimes have an English club, which the ALT would attend and assist in the students&#x27; planning and preparations for debate contests, speech competitions and English camps.

ALTs may also be asked to perform tasks normally done by Japanese students and teachers, such as cleaning the school, cleaning drainage gutters, and removing snow from parking areas. ALTs at some schools, mostly junior high schools, are expected to eat lunch with the students. These ALTs might not be allowed to leave the school for lunch or to run personal errands during their break. ALTs may be instructed to use non-standard English in front of students. They are sometimes asked to perform clerical tasks, such as correcting student writing assignments, by the Japanese teachers. The overall duties of an ALT can vary hugely depending on the whims of teachers, schools, BOEs and cities. Responsibilities can be extremely minimal or more or less to the extent of a full time independent teacher. Therefore, contractual expectations and boundaries are not always matched by the reality of what&#x27;s asked of an ALT at their schools.

==Overview of the private ALT system in Japan==
In 1999, Dispatch Law (労働者派遣) was deregulated to allow dispatch companies to enter into other fields of work aside from the traditional industry of manufacturing, including education. Since then more and more local boards of education have turned to private language companies to provide ALTs rather than using the JET Programme.

The business of private language teaching companies providing ALTs is increasing and some with hundreds of ALTs are covering all parts of the country. There is the impression that the private sector in general continues to grow as The JET Programme loses share in the market. Private dispatch companies vary from large corporations to local firms.

===Differences between JET Programme ALTs and private company ALTs===

*Application: The JET Programme may be very competitive based on the hiring nation (the US, UK, Canada, Australia being examples) or very lax depending on the needs of the Programme for any fiscal year. Private ALT application processes vary, but tend to be highly competitive for smaller companies and very open with larger companies.
*Compensation: As of 2016, JET Programme ALTs are compensated between ¥3.36 and ¥3.96 million annually depending on their year in the program. JET Programme participants will on average receive a higher initial monthly salary than ALTs from most private companies. However, some private companies require ALTs with TEFL certification who may be compensated at a higher level. This is rare, however, with some dispatched ALTs earning as little as ¥2.2 million per annum.
*Support: The JET Programme has a nationwide support system for ALTs that tends to vary in utility based on the nature of each case. Private language companies that provide ALTs to BOEs vary in their approaches to supporting ALTs, ranging from a very hands-off approach to an experience more professionally invigorating than the JET Programme. Private ALTs tend to be more experienced and better trained to start, many being ex-JETs. Teacher support and professional development vary with company.
*Workload: The JET Programme typically follows the request of the BOE regarding the workload of each ALT. A frequent issue with JET Programme ALTs is being required to report to a town office or education center when school is not in session, often when they have no other work to do. In general, ALTs provided by private language teaching companies do not require ALTs to report to the local BOE on days when school is not in session, although they may be required to attend training or asked to take other work during working time. Typically workload and salary are related, in that lower pay is accompanied by fewer required working days or hours.
*External Work: JET Programme ALTs are generally prohibited from working outside the school. Private companies have differing policies that may or may not allow legal work on the side, however, most tend to either provide supplementary work at their own clients, or allow ALTs to seek extra work if they so choose.
*Contractual Term Limits: JET Programme ALTs have a limited number of years to be contracted (to a maximum of 3 or 5 years, with contract renewals happening yearly), while private companies have no such restriction in most cases.

The above list is by no means comprehensive, and some other categories that vary from situation to situation may include: the ability to transfer (both locationally and between positions), evaluation, reward systems, and professional development opportunities.

==Union activity==

===Education law===

Some of the contracts that school boards have signed with private language teaching companies are illegal &quot;gyomu itaku&quot; (service contracts). According to the Japanese Ministry of Education, these contracts violate Japan&#x27;s General Education Law since the principal must be in charge of all staff at their school. However, with these contracts, the company is actually in charge – not the principal.

The licensed Japanese teacher is normally in charge of junior high school and high school classes regardless of where the ALT originates; however in the case of elementary school classes, the ALT is normally responsible for the entire class, with the Japanese teacher either providing limited input or in some cases not being present in the classroom, and for that reason the continuity of school management is sometimes maintained with the school principal in compliance with any legal requirements, as the product being contracted itself is an abstract, education, and the contract basis for private language teaching corporations is to provide education and educational services.

===29.5 hours per week===

It is common for ALTs to be recruited with job contracts with private language companies such as W5, Interac, Borderlink and WING which stipulates ALT working hours as being 29.5 hours per week. In actuality, working hours usually range from 30 to 40 hours due to the fact that transition times between classes and other brief periods of time throughout the working day are scheduled as breaktimes. Employers often have employees sign such contracts in an effort to avoid paying into the employer based Social Insurance program, or &quot;shakai hoken&quot;. While Social Insurance law states that all regular employees should be enrolled by their employer in Shakai Hoken, some companies will consistently tell their employees that they are ineligible. Their reasoning is that the 29.5 hours a week working time written into the contracts fall below an erroneous minimum of 3/4 full-time necessary for eligibility. The Social Insurance Agency uses the 3/4 of the hours of a similar full-time as a guideline. However, the Japanese government has recent stated that there is, in fact, no minimum legal work time requirement for enrollment in Shakai Hoken. Furthermore, no company would ever be prohibited from enrolling their employees in the Social Insurance program. Some AETs dispatched to the City of Nagoya have a 35-hour work week and are not enrolled in Shakai Hoken, receive no paid sick leave, no paid holidays, no paid vacation leave, and are not enrolled in unemployment insurance. They are only paid for days worked and receive no pay between semesters except for a few training sessions.

===Kanagawa Board of Education===

In 2006, ALTs in Kanagawa Prefecture who were previously hired directly as part-time workers rejected the privatization of their jobs to Interac, a nationwide language services dispatch company, and took the Kanagawa Prefecture Board of Education to the Labour Relations Board where the case is still on-going.

As in many cases, the likely cause of the dissolution of the direct-hire situation draws back to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi who took a hard-line stance on privatization (e.g. Japan Post) and the idea of allowing local governments more flexibility in deciding how to spend their budgets.

===Other local Boards of Education===

The General Workers Union has been involved with several boards of education in the Kanto area including the Tokyo Board of Education, the Koga Board of Education (in Ibaraki Prefecture) and the Fukaya Board of Education (in Saitama Prefecture). In the case versus the Tokyo Board of Education, the General Workers Union won a decision stating that the directly hired ALTs were indeed legally classified as &quot;workers&quot; (&quot;rodosha&quot;) and not simply contractors. Further victories were achieved through the private companies that had contracts with the Koga and Fukaya boards of education.

<text>The Faculty Office of the Archbishop of Canterbury is a regulatory body in English law, which also exercises some adjudicatory functions. Its responsibilities include:

* the regulation of notaries public;
* the issue of special marriage licences (but not common marriage licences);
* the conferral of Lambeth degrees.

The Faculty Office is presided over by the Master of the Faculties, who is appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury subject to approval by the Crown. Its jurisdiction is exercised by the &quot;Court of Faculties&quot; and applies to England and Wales. The jurisdiction was conferred upon the Archbishop by the Ecclesiastical Licences Act 1533 (25 Hen. 8. c. 21) as part of the Reformation in England. This Act transferred to the Archbishop of Canterbury powers which had until then been exercised by the Papal Legate to England. For this reason, they are sometimes called the &quot;legatine powers&quot;. They are exercised by the Archbishop of Canterbury not only in the Province of Canterbury but also in the Province of York 
and the area covered by the Church in Wales.

Notaries public in New Zealand and the State of Queensland, Australia are still appointed by the Faculty Office.

:* As Central Catalan is velarised, , in all instances; e.g. &quot;tela&quot; (&#x27;fabric&#x27;). However the velarised (also known as dark l) is not used in the transcriptions of any Catalan variety.
:* The palatal lateral approximant is preserved as a distinct phoneme, with absence of &quot;ieisme&quot; except for the most Castilianised speakers. However, most Majorcan speakers use rather than in words that in Latin had + yod (--, --), --, or --; e.g. &quot;palla&quot; &#x27;straw&#x27;, from Latin . This is known as &quot;iodització&quot;. Note that this phenomenon is more restricted than &quot;ieisme&quot;, as is always used initially e.g. &quot;lluna&quot; (&#x27;moon&#x27;), as well as intervocalically in words that had -- in Latin.
:* Depalatalization of syllable-final and with compensatory diphthongization in Majorcan: &quot;anys (&#x27;years&#x27;), &quot;troncs (&#x27;logs&#x27;).
:* Most Balearic variants preserve final stops in clusters; e.g. , , , and : &quot;camp&quot; &#x27;field&#x27; (feature shared with Modern Valencian).
:* Balearic variants of Catalan have the strongest tendency not to pronounce historical final in any context; e.g. &quot;amor &#x27;love&#x27;, &quot;cor &#x27;heart&#x27;.
:* Assimilation of intervocalic clusters in some Majorcan and Minorcan subvarieties:

:(Notice some of these assimilations may also occur in continental Catalan: &quot;capmoix&quot; &#x27;crestfallen&#x27;).

:Other assimilations (amongst many) include:

:* (e.g. &#x27;afghani&#x27;)
:* (e.g. &#x27;Carl&#x27;)

;Prosody
* Except in Ibiza, in combinations of verb and weak pronoun (clitics), the accent moves to the final element; e.g. &quot;comprar-ne&quot; or (Standard Central Catalan ).

=== Morphology and syntax ===
* Balearic preserves the &quot;salat&quot; definite article (derived from Latin &quot;ipse/ipsa&quot; instead of &quot;ille/illa&quot;), a feature shared only with Sardinian among extant Romance languages, but which was more common in other Catalan and Gascon areas in ancient times. However, the &quot;salat&quot; definite article is also preserved along the Costa Brava (Catalonia) and in the Valencian municipalities of Tàrbena and La Vall de Gallinera.
*The personal article &quot;en&quot;/&quot;na&quot;, &quot;n&quot;&#x27; is used before personal names.
*The first person singular present indicative has a zero exponent, i.e. no visible ending. For example, what in Central Catalan would be &quot;jo parlo&quot; (&#x27;I speak&#x27;) is realised as &quot;jo parl&quot;.
*In verbs of the first conjugation (in &quot;-ar&quot;), the first and second person plural forms end in -&quot;am&quot; and -&quot;au&quot; respectively. For example, &quot;cantam&quot; (&#x27;we sing&#x27;), &quot;cantau&quot; (&#x27;you pl. sing&#x27;).
*Also in verbs of the first conjugation, the imperfect subjunctive is formed with -&quot;a&quot;-, e.g. &quot;cantàs&quot;, &quot;cantassis&quot;. However, the Standard Catalan forms in are nowadays also common in many places.
*In combinations of two unstressed pronouns preceding a verb, one direct with the form &quot;el&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, etc. and the other indirect with the form &quot;me&quot;, &quot;te&quot;, etc., the direct pronoun appears first. For example, &quot;la me dóna&quot; (&#x27;s/he gives it to me&#x27;), Standard Catalan &quot;me la dóna&quot;.

=== Lexicon ===
*Balearic has a large quantity of characteristic vocabulary, especially archaisms preserved by the isolation of the islands and the variety of linguistic influences which surround them. The lexicon differs considerably depending on the subdialect. For example: &quot;al·lot&quot; for standard &quot;&quot;noi&quot; (&#x27;boy&#x27;), &quot;moix&quot; for &quot;gat&quot; (&#x27;cat&#x27;), &quot;besada&quot; for &quot;petó&quot; (&#x27;kiss&#x27;), &quot;ca&quot; for &quot;gos&quot; (&#x27;dog&#x27;), &quot;doblers&quot; for &quot;diners&quot; (&#x27;money&#x27;), &quot;horabaixa&quot; for &quot;vesprada&quot; (&#x27;evening&#x27;) and &quot;rata-pinyada&quot; for &quot;rat-penat&quot;&quot; (&#x27;bat&#x27;).
*Minorcan has a few English loanwords dating back to the British occupation, such as &quot;grevi&quot; (&#x27;gravy&#x27;), &quot;xumaquer&quot; (&#x27;shoemaker&#x27;), &quot;boínder&quot; (&#x27;bow window&#x27;), &quot;xoc&quot; (&#x27;chalk&#x27;) or &quot;ull blec&quot; (&#x27;black eye&#x27;).

== Political questions ==
Some in the Balearic Islands, such as the &quot;Partido Popular&quot; party member and former Balearic president José Ramón Bauzà, argue that the dialects of Balearic Islands are actually separate languages and not dialects of Catalan. During the election of 2011, Bauzà campaigned against having centralized or standardized standards of Catalan in public education.

<doc id="301350" wikidata="Q1330839" url="?curid=301350" title="Hakata-ku, Fukuoka">
<text>is a ward of the city of Fukuoka in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.

Many of Fukuoka Prefecture and Fukuoka City&#x27;s principal government, commercial, retail and entertainment establishments are located in the district. Hakata-ku is also the location of Fukuoka&#x27;s main train station, Hakata Station, Fukuoka Airport and the Hakata Port international passenger ship terminal.

==Geography==
Hakata-ku is a ward of Fukuoka City located on its eastern edge. It is 31.47 km2 with a population of 206,629 (as of January 1, 2009). Much of the ward consists of low-lying plains beside the . The northwestern end of the ward faces Hakata Bay, which includes both ferry and international cruise ship terminals . The northeast end of the ward is slightly elevated, and is named , with nearby Fukuoka Airport. Around Hakata Station is downtown; is the main dining and entertainment district of the ward along the . Hakata-ku also houses the Fukuoka Prefectural office.

== Economy ==
Many Japanese companies have established branch offices in Hakata-ku due to its ease of access to local government offices as well transportation hubs such as Hakata Station and Fukuoka Airport. The headquarters of JR Kyūshū, Best Denki, and many other companies are in the ward.

Air Next, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, is headquartered on the grounds of Fukuoka Airport in Hakata-ku. Link Airs has its headquarters in the Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Building (福岡祇園第一生命ビル &quot;Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Biru&quot;) in Hakata-ku. Cisco has an Asia-Pacific sales office on the 12th floor of the Fukuoka Gion Daiichi Seimei Building.

Prior to its dissolution, Harlequin Air was headquartered on the grounds of the airport in Hakata-ku.

Hakata&#x27;s economy was significantly transformed in 1996 with the opening of Canal City Hakata, an award-winning destination shopping and entertainment center.

===Cruise ship tourism===
From the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China.

In 2014, 91 cruise ships travelled from China called at Hakata. In 2015, 245 cruise ship calls were made at Hakata Port. After expansion and redevelopment of the port facilities, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400. As of 2015, the largest passenger vessel making regular port calls at Hakata is Royal Caribbean International&#x27;s &quot;MS Quantum of the Seas&quot;.

Partly as a result of growing international tourism, in 2015 Fukuoka reported the fastest rising tax revenues and population in Japan.

== History ==
Hakata is one of the oldest cities in Japan. In the Middle Ages, Hakata which faces onto the Genkai-Nada Channel (玄界灘) dividing Japan from Korea, was a base for merchants who traded with China and Korea, and the city housed Japan&#x27;s first Chinatown. Taira no Kiyomori is said to have built the artificial harbor Sode-no-minato (袖の湊) to increase commerce. Hakata was burned down by many wars, including the Mongol invasions.

In the early Edo period, Kuroda Nagamasa, appointed the lord of Chikuzen Province, and most of his samurai vassals lived in Fukusaki, on the opposite shore of the Naka River from Hakata. Kuroda Nagamasa changed the name of the area to Fukuoka after his home town; Fukuoka in Okayama Prefecture. He ordered Tachibana Castle and Najima Castle dismantled, and had Fukuoka Castle built using the stones from those older castles. At that time Hakata was no larger than one square kilometer, demarcated by defensive lines along the Naka River, the Boshu-bori (or Boshu Canal), and the Ishido or Mikasa River.

In 1876, Hakata, then also known as Dai-Ni-Dai-ku, and Fukuoka, or Dai-Ichi-Dai-ku, were merged. In 1878 the settlement was renamed Fukuoka-ku (福岡区) by the Fukuoka prefectural government, though the population of Hakata was 25,677 and that of Fukuoka was 20,410. At that time, the name Hakata vanished from the administration. In 1889, after a local referendum in which half the voters chose the name Fukuoka and half chose Hakata, the city was officially renamed Fukuoka-shi, but at the same time a new train station then being built was named Hakata Station.

An imperial decree issued in July 1899 established Hakata as an open port for trade with the United States and the United Kingdom.

In 1972, when Fukuoka City was granted designated status by government ordinance, a ward including the old Hakata area was given the name Hakata-ku.

In 2016 a large sinkhole appeared in the city center just west of Hakata station. The sinkhole was filled and the affected roads were completely repaired within a few days. However, the hasty repair seems to have been problematic as less than a month later the road began showing signs of imminent implosion.

== Culture ==
Hakata was the traditional center for the manufacture of Hakata ningyō, which are traditional Japanese dolls that are famous throughout Japan. Today, almost all Hakata ningyō makers (&quot;Hakata ningyō shi&quot;) have their factories in the Old Hakata Area, a part of modern Hakata-ku.

Hakata-ori is a textile used for obi of kimono.

It is also the home of Mentai Rock, named after the popular mentaiko dish served in the region, that spawned numerous J-pop idols during the early 1980s. Neo Mentai Rock is the name given to a recent renewal in activity from local musicians.

Hakata-ben is the local Japanese dialect spoken in the Old Hakata Area.

Hakata is also the location of the pop group HKT48.
Other popular groups from Hakata are Kanikapila and NUMBER GIRL.

Parts of the famous crime novel &#x27;Points and lines&#x27; (&#x27;Ten to Sen&#x27; in Japanese) by the award-winning Japanese writer Seichō Matsumoto occur in Hakata and its train station.

The South Korean government maintains the Korea Education Institution (; ) in Hakata-ku.

<text>The Cuillin () is a range of mostly jagged rocky mountains on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. The main Cuillin ridge is also called the Black Cuillin to distinguish it from the Red Cuillin (&quot;&quot;), which lie to the east of Glen Sligachan.

The peaks of the Black Cuillin are mainly composed of gabbro, a very rough igneous rock which provides a superb grip for mountaineers; and basalt, which can be very slippery when wet. The rocks forming the ridge of the Black Cuillin (and outliers such Blà Bheinn) are dark, particularly in the shade, but when in sunlight the Black Cuillin can appear grey to brown. The main ridge forms a narrow crest, with steep cliffs and scree slopes. The ridge is about long (from Gars-bheinn in the south to Sgùrr nan Gillean in the northeast), and curves in an irregular semi-circle around Loch Coruisk, which lies at the heart of the range. The highest point of the Cuillin, and of the Isle of Skye, is Sgùrr Alasdair in the Black Cuillin at .

The Red Cuillin are mainly composed of granite, which is paler than the gabbro (with a reddish tinge from some angles in some lights) and has weathered into more rounded hills with vegetation cover to summit level and long scree slopes on their flanks. These hills are lower and, being less rocky, have fewer scrambles or climbs. The highest point of the red hills is Glamaig at , one of only two Corbetts on Skye (the other being Garbh-bheinn, part of the small group of gabbro outliers surrounding Blà Bheinn).

The scenic beauty of the Cuillin has led to it being designated a national scenic area, one of forty such areas in Scotland. A Scottish Natural Heritage review of the special qualities of the Cuillin stated:
==Etymology==

There are several theories about the derivation of the name &#x27;Cuillin&#x27;. One suggestion is that it comes from the Old Norse word &quot;kjölen&quot;, which literally means the keel of a boat, suggesting a similarity with an upturned Viking longship. Peter Drummond, in &quot;Scottish Hill and Mountain Names&quot; (1991), noted that this is also a name of the Scandinavian Mountains and says it can mean &#x27;high rocky mountain&#x27;. Drummond later considered the Irish placename element &quot;cuilleann&quot;, meaning &#x27;a steep slope&#x27;, which is found in mountain names such as Slieve Gullion. However, he pointed out that the element is rare, and that most mountain names around Skye come from Norse. Another suggestion is that it comes from Gaelic &quot;cuilionn&quot;, meaning &#x27;holly&#x27;, because of the mountains&#x27; jagged shape. The name has also been linked to Gaelic mythology, with the hills being the place where Cúchullin learnt archery from the female warrior Scáthach.

==Natural history==
The Cuillin are a diverse and complex geological landscape, and there is a clear distinction visible between the two mountain types. The mountains formed from the remains of the magma chambers which fed volcanic eruptions. In the Black Cuillin the rocks cooled to form gabbro, the coarse-grained rock that makes up much of the range. Cracks and fissures in the rock provided pathways for later magma intrusions, leading to dykes of basalt which are commonly seen across Skye. The Red Cuillin also have volcanic origins, being formed from a later intrusion of acidic, granitic rock. This granite was more uniformly eroded by wind and water than the gabbro and basalt, causing the red hills to have smoother outlines.

The Cuillin provide classic examples of glacial topography and were the subject of an early published account by James Forbes in 1846 (who had become a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh aged only nineteen). He partnered Louis Agassiz on his trip to Scotland in 1840 and although they subsequently argued, Forbes went on to publish other important papers on Alpine glaciers.
In 1904 Alfred Harker published &quot;The Tertiary Igneous Rocks of Skye&quot;, the first detailed scientific study of an extinct volcano.

The Cuillin encompasses a wide range of habitats, changing with altitude. At the base there are conifer plantations, coastal woodlands and areas of heather moorland and rough grassland. The lower slopes are covered by various different types of bog, with grassland on the better-drained slopes that are found above . Higher up, the rocky hills are largely bare, with exposed rock and scree. The entire area is designated as a Special Protection Area under the Natura 2000 programme due particularly for its importance to golden eagles. The site is of European importance for these birds, and holds one of the highest-density populations in Britain, having an unusually high breeding productivity. Eleven pairs were estimated in 1992; this representing about 3% of the breeding population in Great Britain at that time.

The Cuillin are protected as a national scenic area, defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The areas protected by the designation are considered to represent the type of scenic beauty &quot;popularly associated with Scotland and for which it is renowned&quot;. The &quot;Cuillin Hills National Scenic Area&quot; covers , of which is on land, with a further being marine (i.e. below low tide level).

==History==
Due to the rocky nature of the Cuillin they have historically been of little use for agriculture: this contrasts with the majority of the highlands, where the hills were used to provide seasonal grazing for cattle and sheep. Despite the lack of earlier human presence in the hills themselves, there is much evidence of historic settlement in the surrounding glens, with prehistoric hut circles found in Glenbrittle, and a stone circle identified in Glen Sligachan. Rubha an Dùnain, an uninhabited peninsula to the south of the main ridge, has a variety of archaeological sites dating from the Neolithic onwards. There is a 2nd or 3rd millennium BC chambered cairn, an Iron Age promontory fort and the remains of another prehistoric settlement dating from the Bronze Age nearby. Loch na h-Airde on the peninsula is linked to the sea by an artificial &quot;Viking&quot; canal that may date from the later period of Norse settlement.

The Norse held sway throughout the Hebrides from the 9th century until after the Treaty of Perth in 1266. In the post–Norse period the most powerful clans on Skye were Clan MacLeod, originally based in Trotternish, and Clan Macdonald of Sleat. Following the disintegration of the Lordship of the Isles, the Mackinnons also emerged as an independent clan, whose substantial landholdings in Skye were centred on Strathaird. The MacDonalds and the MacLeods were bitter rivals, and two major battles of this period were fought between the clans at Harta Corrie and Coire Na Creich in the Cuillin:

*In 1395 a force of MacDonald clansmen landed at Loch Eynort, and headed north along Glen Sligachan, intending to invade MacLeod land. They were met by a force of MacLeods at Harta Corrie, below Sgùrr nan Gillean at the head of Glen Sligachan. The battle was a victory for the MacDonalds, who &quot;fought the entire day till not one Macleod was left, and the bodies of the slain were piled round the base of a huge rock, topped by a Rowan tree and still called the &#x27;Bloody Stone&#x27;&quot; according to MEM Donaldson.
*The Battle of Coire Na Creiche, the last Scottish clan battle fought on Skye, was fought on the slopes below Bruach na Frìthe, near the head of Glenbrittle in 1601. The MacDonalds of Sleat defeated the MacLeods after a bitter feud.

Boswell and Johnson visited Skye during their tour of the Western Isles in 1773, and observed snow falling on the summits of the range in September. Boswell described the Cuillin as &quot;a prodigious range of mountains, capped with rocks like pinnacles in a strange variety of shapes&quot;.

Uniquely for a group of Scottish mountains there are no records of the majority of the Cuillin summits having been climbed prior to the start of mountaineering as a leisure activity in the Victorian era, a situation reflected in the fact that around half the summits had no recorded name prior to this period, although names for corries and other features were in existence. Many of the summits are thus named after early climbers such as John MacKenzie (Sgùrr MhicChoinnich), Alexander Nicolson (Sgùrr Alasdair), and Norman Collie (Sgùrr Thormaid).

===Ownership===
The Cuillin now consists of two estates divided by Glen Sligachan. The hills on the west side of Glen Sligachan (the Black Cuillin) remained the property of Clan MacLeod despite the long history of conflict between them and Clan MacDonald. The earliest formal record of MacLeod ownership was in a land grant from the Crown in 1611. In 2000 the Cuillin were put on sale for £10 million by the clan chief, John MacLeod of MacLeod, in a scheme of land in exchange for repairs to Dunvegan Castle, however there was a dispute over ownership, as opponents of the sale argued that the charter referred to the MacLeod&#x27;s Tables which stand across the loch from Dunvegan Castle and not to the Cuillin themselves. A deal was cut for the property to be gifted in return for repairs to the clan castle, although it later fell through, with opponents arguing that the cost was out of proportion compared to other equivalent land sales. Following the death of John MacLeod in 2007 his successor, Hugh Magnus MacLeod of MacLeod, found alternative funding sources, and as of 2017 ownership of the main range remains in the MacLeod family.

The &quot;Strathaird, Torrin and Sconser Estate&quot; lies on the eastern side of Glen Sligachan, encompassing the Red Cuillin and Bla Bheinn: it is owned by the John Muir Trust, a charity that seeks to protect and enhance wild places. Strathaird Estate was formerly owned by musician Ian Anderson, the frontman for Jethro Tull, who sold the estate to the trust in 1994, for around £750,000.

==Climbing and hillwalking==

The summits of the Cuillin are bare rock, jagged in outline and with steep cliffs and deep cut corries and gullies. Twelve Black Cuillin peaks are listed as Munros, though one of them, Blaven, is part of a group of outliers separated from the main ridge by Glen Sligachan.

The scrambler can access most of the individual peaks by their easiest routes. Only the Inaccessible Pinnacle is a graded rock climb (Moderate) by its simplest line but several of the other summits require scrambling skills. Navigation on the ridge is difficult due to jagged terrain and magnetic abnormalities that make compass reading unreliable. The majority of scramblers heading on to the Black Cuillin do so via routes from Glenbrittle (where there is a campsite and a youth hostel) or Sligachan for the northern peaks: due to the remoteness of Loch Coruisk, which can only be reached by boat or a walk from Elgol, routes starting from this side are less frequented.

In addition to climbing individual peaks, there is the challenge of a full mountain traverse of the main Black Cuillin ridge. Although only in length, the average traverse is likely to take 15–20 hours from sea level at Glenbrittle to the bar of the Sligachan Hotel, owing to the difficulty of the terrain and route-finding problems. The first recorded traverse in under 24 hours was on 10 June 1911 by Leslie Shadbolt and Alastair C. McLaren, in 12 hours 18 minutes top to top (16.75 hours in total). The record for the full traverse, set by Finlay Wild in October 2013, stands at 2 hours, 59 minutes and 22 seconds (though this time is from Gars-bheinn to Sgùrr nan Gillean and does not include the initial ascent from Glenbrittle or the final descent to Sligachan). A further issue for those attempting the full traverse is the fact that there are no natural sources of water on the ridge (except for winter snows and melt water), although there are a few high burns just off the main ridge from which water can be obtained.

Some believe the ultimate mountaineering experience of the UK is the full traverse of the Cuillin Ridge, especially under winter conditions. The Isle of Skye&#x27;s position in the warm Gulf Stream makes genuine winter conditions rare, and the very short winter days probably make a 24-hour traverse impractical. The first recorded, over two days, was in 1965 by D. Crabbe, B. Robertson, T. Patey and H. MacInnes.

A longer challenge, known as the &quot;Greater Traverse&quot; includes all the Skye Munros, though omitting some gabbro outliers: this involves continuing on to Clach Glas and Blaven totalling some distance and ascent. This traverse was first done independently by two parties, in the summer of 1939, with I. Charleson and W. Forde claiming precedence over W. H. Murray &amp; R. G. Donaldon a few weeks later (see W. H. Murray&#x27;s book for details of his traverse).

Extending the Greater Traverse even further is the Cullin Round. This takes in most of the major peaks of the Black and Red Cullin, totalling , ascent and 12 Munros. The fastest time of 16 hours 46 minutes was set by Mark Shaw in 2002.

The Trans Cullin Challenge is yet to be completed in under 24 hours. It is an east-west traverse of every Cullin top between Gars-bheinn and Beinn na Caillich, totalling some , ascent and 70 tops.

===List of summits===
The list below shows all the Munros, Corbetts and Grahams of the Cuillin. It, therefore, excludes peaks such as Clach Glas, which do not meet the criteria for these hill listings.

<text>Liquid War is a free software multi-player action game based on particle flow mechanic. Thomas Colcombet developed the core concept and the original shortest path algorithm, the software was programmed by . Liquid War 6 is a GNU package distributed as free software and part of the GNU project.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay takes place on a 2D battlefield, usually with some obstacles. Each player (2 to 6, computer or human) has an army of particles and a cursor. The objective of the game is to assimilate all enemy particles. The players can only move their cursors and cannot directly control the particles. Each particle follows the shortest path around the obstacles to its team&#x27;s cursor. A player may have several thousands particles at a time, giving the collection of particles a look of a liquid blob. When a particle moves into a particle from a different team, it will fight and if the opponent particle fails to fight back (it is not moving in the opposite direction) it will eventually be assimilated by its attacker. As particles cannot die but only change teams, the total number of particles on the map remains constant. Since a particle can only fight in one direction at a time (towards its team&#x27;s cursor), a player that surrounds its opponents will have a distinct advantage. The game ends when one player controls all of the particles or when the time runs out. When the time runs out, the player with the most particles wins.

There are multiple maps which affect the obstacles in the battlefield. These obstacles may affect the strategies of the game.

 is a multiplayer game and can be played by up to 6 people on one computer, or over the Internet or a LAN. A single player mode is available in which the opponents are controlled by the computer. The computer AI&#x27;s &quot;strategy&quot; is to constantly choose a random point in the enemy and move its cursor to it.

==History==
The shortest path algorithm was invented by Thomas Colcombet before the game itself in Spring 1995. The game came as a result of the algorithm, when he realized its applicability to gaming. Colcombet&#x27;s friend, Christian Mauduit, enhanced the algorithm and coded the game.

 3.0 was released on 1 July 1995. It was a &quot;barely usable&quot; MS-DOS game with no network support. Version 5.0 was released on 26 September 1998. It was a complete rewrite and used the Allegro library. Network support was introduced in version 5.4.0, released on 7 July 2001. , the current stable version is 5.6.4 and is available under MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and FreeBSD. Its author, Christian Mauduit, has announced that a complete rewrite is in progress to produce version 6.0, which will abandon the Allegro used for 5.x releases for a full OpenGL implementation. Version 6.0 is a part of the GNU project and was expected to be released in 2008. Version 0.0.7 beta, a testing version, was released in October 2009. Version 0.0.8 beta was released in 2010. Most parts of the game and engine are finished, and playing hotseat and/or against bots works fine, just like version 5.x. Network mode is in prototype stage.

== Reception ==
In 2000 a CNN article on Linux games highlighted the fun with .
In 2002, received the &quot;&quot; award by The Linux Game Tome, and in 2003 it was nominated for the Les Trophées du Libre, an International Free Software Competition. Liquid War was also distributed by various download portals, for instance computerbild.de counted 20,000 downloads.

<text>Bai Chongxi (18 March 1893 – 2 December 1966; , , Xiao&#x27;erjing: ) was a Chinese general in the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China (ROC) and a prominent Chinese Nationalist leader. He was of Hui ethnicity and of the Muslim faith. From the mid-1920s to 1949, Bai and his close ally Li Zongren ruled Guangxi province as regional warlords with their own troops and considerable political autonomy. His relationship with Chiang Kai-shek was at various times antagonistic and cooperative. He and Li Zongren supported the anti-Chiang warlord alliance in the Central Plains War in 1930, then supported Chiang in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War. Bai was the first defense minister of the Republic of China from 1946 to 1948. After losing to the Communists in 1949, he fled to Taiwan, where he died in 1966.

==Early life and Warlord era==
Bai was born in Guilin, Guangxi and given the courtesy name Jiansheng (). He was a descendant of a Persian merchant of the name Baiderluden, whose descendants adopted the Chinese surname Bai. His Muslim name was Omar Bai Chongxi.

He was the second of three sons. His family was said to have come from Sichuan. At the age of 14 he attended the Guangxi Military Cadre Training School in Guilin, a modern-style school run by Cai E to modernize Guangxi&#x27;s military. Bai and classmates Huang Shaohong and Li Zongren would become the three leading figures of Guangxi&#x27;s military. For a time Bai withdrew from the military school at the request of his family and studied at the civilian Guangxi Schools of Law and Political Science.

With the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, under the leadership of Huang Shaoxiong, Bai joined a Students Dare to Die corps. After entering the Nanjing Enlistment Corps he transferred from the Corps to the Second Military Preparatory School at Wuchang. He graduated from the school in 1914, then underwent pre-cadet training for six months before attending the third class of Baoding Military Academy in June 1915. He became a 1st Guangxi Division probationary officer upon returning to Guangxi.

Bai rose to fame during the warlord era by allying with Huang Shaohong (a fellow deputy commander of the Model Battalion of the Guangxi First Division) and Li Zongren as supporters of Kuomintang leader Sun Yat-sen. This alliance, called the New Guangxi Clique, proceeded to move against Guangxi warlord Lu Rongting in 1924. The coalition&#x27;s efforts brought Guangxi Province under ROC jurisdiction, and Bai and Li represented a new generation of Guangxi leaders.

The Nationalist chief of staff (acting) was Bai. The 13th Army had him as the commander. The Nationalist Northern Punitive Expedition was participated in by Bai.

During the Northern Expedition (1926–28) Bai was the Chief of Staff of the National Revolutionary Army and credited with many victories over the northern warlords, often using speed, maneuver and surprise to defeat larger enemy forces. He led the Eastern Route Army that conquered Hangzhou and Shanghai in 1927. As garrison commander of Shanghai, he also took part in the purge of Communist elements of the National Revolutionary Army on April 4, 1927, and of the labor unions in Shanghai. Bai also commanded the forward units that first entered Beijing and was credited with being the senior commander on site to complete the Northern Expedition. For many of his battlefield exploits during the Northern expedition, he was given the laudatory nickname Xiao Zhuge, literally &quot;Zhuge Liang Jr.&quot;, of the Three Kingdoms fame.
Bai was the commander of Kuomintang forces in the Shanghai massacre of 1927, where he directed the KMT purge of Communists in the party.

In 1928, during the Northern Expedition, Bai led Kuomintang forces in the defeat and destruction of Fengtian Clique Gen. Zhang Zongchang, capturing 20,000 of his 50,000 troops and almost capturing Zhang himself, who escaped to Manchuria.

Bai personally had around 2,000 Muslims under his control during his stay in Beijing in 1928 after the Northern Expedition was completed; it was reported by &quot;Time&quot; magazine that they &quot;swaggered riotously&quot; in the aftermath In June 1928 in Beijing, Bai Chongxi announced that the forces of the Kuomintang would seize control of Manchuria and the enemies of the Kuomintang would &quot;scatter like dead leaves before the rising wind&quot;.

Bai was out of money and bankrupt in December 1928. He planned to lead 60,000 troops from east China to Xinjiang province and construct a railroad as a barrier against Russian encroachment in Xinjiang. His plan was perceived by some to be against Feng Yuxiang. The Military Council refused to authorize him leaving Beiping to go to Hankou.

At the end of the Northern Expedition, Chiang Kai-shek began to agitate to get rid of the Guangxi forces. At one time in 1929 Bai had to escape to Vietnam to avoid harm. Hubei and Guangxi were subjected to the Hankou subcouncil of Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. Li and Bai&#x27;s Hankou and Canton self-ruling governments were terminated by Chiang. Hankou was captured by Chiang during the dispute between the Guangxi faction and Nanjing. From 1930 to 1936, Bai was instrumental in the Reconstruction of Guangxi, which became a &quot;model&quot; province with a progressive administration. Guangxi supplied over 900,000 soldiers to the war effort against Japan.

During the Chinese Civil War Bai fought against the Communists. In the Long March he allowed the Communists to slip through Guangxi.

Governing his province aptly and capably were two of the things Bai was renowned for in China.

Prominent Muslims like Generals Ma Liang, Ma Fuxiang and Bai Chongxi met in 1931 in Nanjing to discuss intercommunal tolerance between Hui and Han.

==Second Sino-Japanese War==
The 4th Army Groups chief of staff was Bai Chongxi.

An anti-Japanese war was called for by Bai Chongxi, Li Zongren and Chen Jitang in 1936. The menace posed by Japan was seen by Bai Chongxi and Li Zongren.

Formal hostilities broke out on 7 July 1937 between China and Japan with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident outside Beijing. On 4 August 1937 Bai rejoined the Central Government at the invitation of Chiang Kai-shek. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he was the Deputy Chief of the General Staff responsible for operations and training. He was the key strategist who convinced Chiang to adopt a &quot;Total War&quot; strategy in which China would trade space for time, adopt guerrilla tactics behind enemy lines and disrupt enemy supply lines at every opportunity. When the better armed and trained Japanese troops advanced, the Chinese would adopt a scorched earth campaign in the enemy&#x27;s path to deny them local supply. Bai was also involved in many key campaigns including the first major victory at the Battle of Tai&#x27;erzhuang in Shandong Province in the spring of 1938 when he teamed up with Gen. Li Zongren to defeat a superior enemy. China managed to check and delay the Japanese advance for several months. Subsequently, Bai was appointed Commander of the Field Executive Office of the Military Council in Guilin, with responsibility for the 3rd, 4th, 7th and 9th War Zones. In that capacity he oversaw the successful defense of Changsha, capital of Hunan Province. Between 1939 and 1942, the Japanese attacked Changsha three times and were repelled each time. Bai also directed the Battle of South Guangxi and Battle of Kunlun Pass to retake South Guangxi. The 64th Army and 46th Army were requested to be outfitted by Bai via Gen. Lindsey.

Bai&#x27;s Guangxi soldiers were praised as a &quot;crack&quot; (as in elite) army during the war against Japan, and he was known to be an able general who could lead the Chinese resistance should Chiang Kai-shek be assassinated. The majority of Chinese presumed that Chiang Kai-shek, as leader of China, tapped Bai to inherit his position. Bai Chongxi led the competent Guangxi Army against the Japanese.

In refusing to obey commands from Chiang if he assumed them to be wrong and flawed, Bai Chongxi was alone among fellow military men.

Jihad was declared obligatory and a religious duty for all Chinese Muslims against Japan after 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Bai also sheltered the Muslim Yuehua publication in Guilin, which printed quotes from the Quran and Hadith justifying the need for Chiang Kai-shek as leader of China. Also, promoted Chinese nationalism and uniting Hui to the Han during the war against Japan.

During the war, Bai traveled throughout the Muslim northwestern provinces of China controlled by the Ma Clique and met with Ma Clique generals to defeat Japanese propaganda. The Hui Muslim Xidaotang sect pledged allegiance to the Kuomintang after their rise to power and Bai Chongxi acquainted Chiang Kai-shek with the &quot;Xidaotang jiaozhu&quot; Ma Mingren in 1941 in Chongqing.

Bai Chongxi headed the Chinese Islamic National Salvation Federation. In January 1945, he was awarded the Legion of Merit of the United States.

==Chinese Civil War==

Following the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Chinese Civil War resumed in full-fledged fighting. In the spring of 1946 the Chinese Communists were active in Manchuria. A crack People&#x27;s Liberation Army unit of 100,000 strong under the Communist Gen. Lin Biao occupied a key railroad junction at Siping. Kuomintang forces could not dislodge them after several attempts; Chiang Kai-shek then sent Bai to oversee the operation. After some redeployment, Nationalist forces were able to decisively defeat Lin&#x27;s forces after a two-day pitched battle. This was to be the first major victory for the Kuomintang in the 1946-49 stage of the civil war before the fall of mainland China to the Chinese Communists.

In June 1946 Bai was appointed Minister of National Defense. It turned to be a post without power, as Chiang began to bypass Bai on major decisions regarding the Chinese Civil War. Chiang would hold daily briefings in his residence without inviting Bai and began to direct front-line troops personally down to the division level, bypassing the chain of command. The Civil War went poorly for the Kuomintang as Chiang&#x27;s strategy of holding onto provincial capitals and leaving the countryside to the Communists very quickly caused the downfall of his forces, which had a 4:1 numerical superiority at the beginning of the conflict.

During the Ili Rebellion Bai was considered by the government for the post of Governor of Xinjiang. The position later was given to Masud Sabri, a pro-Kuomintang Uyghur leader.

In April 1948 the first National Assembly in China convened in Nanjing, with thousands of delegates from all over China representing different provinces and ethnic groups. Bai Chongxi, acting as Minister of National Defense, debriefed the Assembly on the military situation, completely ignoring Northern China and Manchuria in his report. Delegates from Manchuria in the assembly responded by yelling out and calling for the death of those responsible for the loss of Manchuria.

In November 1948 Bai, in command of forces in Hankou, met with Generals Fu Zuoyi, Zhang Zhizhong and Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing about defending Suzhou, the gateway to the Yangzi River valley.

Bai told the Central Political Council of the Kuomintang that negotiating with the Communists would only make them more powerful. Governor of Hunan Cheng Qian, and Bai reached a consensus that they should impede the advance of the Communists by negotiating with them.

In January 1949, with the Communists close to victory, almost everyone in the Nationalist media, political and military command began to demand peace as a slogan and turn against Chiang. Bai Chongxi decided to follow suit with the mainstream current and defied Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s orders, refusing to battle Communists near the Huai River and demanding that his soldiers, which were &quot;lent&quot;, be sent back to him so he could secure his hold in the province of Guangxi and ignore the central government in Nanjing. Bai was the commander of four armies in Central China in the Hankou region. He demanded that the government negotiate with the Communists like the others. Bai was in charge of the defense of the capital, Nanjing. He sent a telegram requesting that Chiang Kai-shek step down as president, amid a storm of requests by other Kuomintang military and political figures for Chiang to step down and allow a peace deal with the Communists.

When Communist Gen. Lin Biao mounted an attack on Bai Chongxi&#x27;s forces in Hankou, they retreated quickly, leaving the &quot;rice bowl&quot; of China open for the Communists. Bai retreated to headquarters at Hengyang via a railroad from Hankou to Canton. The railroad then provided access to Guilin where his home was. In August at Hengyang, Bai Chongxi reorganized his troops. In October, as the Canton fell to the Communists, who were almost in complete control of China, Bai Chongxi still commanded 200,000 of his elite troops, making a return to Guangxi for a final stand after covering for Canton.

==Taiwan==

The riots following the February 28 Incident of 28 February 1947 that broke out in Taiwan due to poor governance by the central government appointed officials and the garrison forces caused many casualties of both native Taiwanese and mainland residents. Bai was sent as Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s personal representative on a fact finding mission and to help pacify the populace. After a two-week tour, including interviews with various segments of the Taiwan population, Bai made sweeping recommendations, including replacement of the governor, and prosecution of his chief of secret police. He also granted amnesty to student violators of peace on the condition that their parents take custody and guarantee subsequent proper behavior. For his forthright actions, native Taiwanese held him in high regard.

Bai had another falling out with Chiang when he supported General Li Zongren, his fellow Guangxi comrade-in-arms, for the vice presidency in the 1948 general election when Li won against Chiang&#x27;s hand picked candidate, Sun Fo. Chiang then removed Bai from the Defense Minister post and assigned him the responsibility for Central and South China. Bai&#x27;s forces were the last ones to leave the mainland for Hainan Island and eventually to Taiwan.

He served Chief of the General Staff since 1927 until his retirement in 1949. After he came to Taiwan, he was the appointed vice director of the strategic advisory commission in the presidential office. He also continued to serve in the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. He reorganized the party from 1950 to 1952.

After the Communist victory, some of Bai Chongxi&#x27;s Guangxi troops fled to French Indochina where they were detained. Others went to Hainan in retreat.

In 1951, Bai Chongxi made a speech to the entire Muslim world calling for a war against the Soviet Union, claiming that the &quot;imperialist ogre&quot; leader Joseph Stalin was engineering World War III, and Bai also called upon Muslims to avoid the Indian leader Jawaharlal Nehru, accusing him of being blind to Soviet imperialism.

He and Chiang never reconciled and he lived in semi-retirement until he died of coronary thrombosis on 2 December 1966 at the age of 73. Bai was then given a military funeral by the government, with a Kuomintang Blue Sky with a White Sun flag over his coffin. Bai was buried in the Muslim section of the Liuzhangli (六張犁) Cemetery in Taipei, Taiwan.

==Personal life==
As a Muslim, he was Chairman of the Chinese Islamic National Salvation Federation, and then the Chinese Muslim Association. Bai Chongxi was a board member of the All-China Inter-religious Association, representing Islam, the other members of the board were a Catholic bishop, Methodist bishop, and the Buddhist abbot Taixu.

Bai sent his son Pai Hsien-yung to Catholic schools in Hong Kong.

During the Northern Expedition, in 1926 in Guangxi, Bai Chongxi led his troops in destroying Buddhist temples and smashing idols, turning the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters. It was reported that almost all of Buddhist monasteries in Guangxi were destroyed by Bai in this manner. The monks were removed. Bai led a wave of anti-foreignism in Guangxi, attacking American, European, and other foreigners and missionaries, and generally making the province unsafe for foreigners. Westerners fled from the province, and some Chinese Christians were also attacked as imperialist agents.

The three goals of his movement were anti-foreignism, anti-imperialism, and anti-religion. Bai led the anti-religious movement, against superstition. Huang Shaoxiong, also a Kuomintang member of the New Guangxi Clique, supported Bai&#x27;s campaign, and Huang was a non-Muslim, the anti religious campaign was agreed upon by all Guangxi Kuomintang members, so it may have not had anything to do with Bai&#x27;s beliefs.

As a Kuomintang member, Bai and the other Guangxi clique members allowed the Communists to continue attacking foreigners and idols, since they shared the goal of expelling the foreign powers from China, but they stopped Communists from initiating social change.

British diplomats reported that he also drank wine and ate pork.

Bai Chongxi was interested in Xinjiang, a predominately Muslim province. He wanted to resettle disbanded Chinese soldiers there to prevent it from being seized by the Soviet Union. Bai personally wanted to lead an expedition to seize back Xinjiang to bring it under Chinese control, in the style that Zuo Zongtang led during the Dungan revolt. Bai&#x27;s partner in the Guangxi clique Huang Shaohong planned an invasion of Xinjiang. During the Kumul Rebellion Chiang Kai-shek was ready to send Huang Shaohong and his expeditionary force which he assembled to assist Muslim General Ma Zhongying against Sheng Shicai, but when Chiang heard about the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang, he decided to withdraw to avoid an international incident if his troops directly engaged the Soviets, leaving Ma alone without reinforcements to fight the Red Army. Huang was suspicious of this, suspecting that Chiang feared that the Guangxi clique was trying to take control of Xinjiang rather than Chiang&#x27;s Nanjing regime.

==Impact==
Bai&#x27;s reputation as a military strategist was well known. Evans Carlson, a United States Marine Corps colonel, noted that Bai &quot;was considered by many to be the keenest of Chinese military men.&quot; Edgar Snow went even further, calling him &quot;one of the most intelligent and efficient commanders boasted by any army in the world.&quot;

Bai is the father of Kenneth Hsien-yung Pai, Chinese author and playwright now living in the United States.
Bai and his wife had ten children, three girls and seven boys. He married his wife Ma P&#x27;ei-chang in 1925.

Of his ten children, three are still living, scattered across America and Taiwan. Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin announced in March 2013 that Bai&#x27;s tomb will form the basis for a Muslim cultural area and Taiwan historical park.

Bai&#x27;s maternal grandson Muhammad Ma is a Halal butcher, and travels across Taiwan working to preserve the Taiwanese Islamic Community. He also helps foreign migrants with any legal issues they may face in Taiwan.

<text>Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) is an American chemical company. UCC is a wholly owned subsidiary (since February 6, 2001) of Dow Chemical Company. Union Carbide produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers. Some are high-volume commodities and others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller markets. Markets served include paints and coatings, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles, agriculture, and oil and gas. The company is a former component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Founded in 1917 as the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation, from a merger with National Carbon Company, the company&#x27;s researchers developed an economical way to make ethylene from natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, giving birth to the modern petrochemical industry. The company divested consumer products businesses Eveready and Energizer batteries, Glad bags and wraps, Simoniz car wax and Prestone antifreeze. The company divested other businesses before being acquired by Dow including electronic chemicals, polyurethane intermediates, industrial gases (Linde) and carbon products.

==History==
The &quot;Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation&quot; was formed on November 1, 1917, from the merger of the Union Carbide Company founded in 1898, the National Carbon Company founded in 1886, Linde Air Products Company, a maker of liquid oxygen at Buffalo confiscated from &quot;Gesellschaft für Linde&#x27;s Eismaschinen AG&quot; under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, and the Prest-O-Lite company, manufacturer of calcium carbide in Indianapolis. In 1920, the company set up a chemicals division which manufactured ethylene glycol for use as automotive antifreeze. The company continued to acquire related chemical producers, including the Bakelite Corporation in 1939. The company changed its name to &quot;Union Carbide Corporation&quot; in 1957 and was often referred to as Carbide. It operated Oak Ridge National Laboratory from 1947 to 1984.

During the Cold War, the company was active in the field of rocket propulsion research and development for aerospace and guided missile applications, particularly in the field of chemicals and plastics, solid rocket motors, and storable liquid fuels. R&amp;D and engineering were conducted at the Technical Center in South Charleston, West Virginia. The Aerospace Materials Department was part of the company&#x27;s Carbon Products Division.

&quot;Ucar batteries&quot; was Carbide&#x27;s industrial and consumer zinc chloride battery business. The business, including Eveready and Energizer alkaline batteries, was sold to Ralston Purina in 1986, following a hostile takeover attempt.

After the Bhopal disaster, Union Carbide was the subject of repeated takeover attempts. In order to pay off its debt, Carbide sold many of its most familiar brands such as Glad Trashbags and Eveready Batteries. Dow Chemical announced the purchase of Carbide in 1999 for $8.89 billion in stock. The deal was consummated in 2001 and valued at $11.6 billion.

==Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster==

The Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster took place between 1927 and 1932 in a West Virginia tunnel project led by Union Carbide. During the construction of the tunnel, workers found the mineral silica and were asked to mine it for use in electroprocessing steel. The workers were not given masks or breathing equipment to use while mining, despite best practices at the time. Due to silica dust exposure, many workers developed silicosis, a debilitating lung disease. According to a marker on site, there were 109 admitted deaths. A congressional hearing placed the death toll at 476, but a book published by epidemiologist Martin Cherniack, and as stated by the U.S. National Park Service, estimated the death toll to be 764, making it America&#x27;s deadliest industrial disaster.

==Asbestos mining and &#x27;Calidria&#x27; brand fibers==
In the early 1960s, Union Carbide Corporation began mining a newly identified outcrop of chrysotile asbestos fibers near King City and New Idria, California. These fibers were sold under the brand name &quot;Calidria&quot;, a combination of &quot;Cal&quot; and &quot;Idria&quot;, and sold in large quantities for a wide variety of purposes, including additives for joint compound or drywall accessory products. Union Carbide sold the mine to its employees under the name KCAC (&quot;King City Asbestos Mine&quot;) in the 1980s, but it only operated for a few more years.

==1984 Bhopal disaster==
Union Carbide India Limited, owned by Union Carbide (50.9%) and Indian investors (49.1%), operated a pesticide plant in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh. This plant was opened in 1969. The pesticides and herbicides they produced were created from a insecticide carbaryl, which is normally produced using a base chemical, methyl isocyanate (MIC).

Initially this plant imported MIC, but in 1979 the company decided to manufacture the ingredients on their own. They built a MIC unit within the Bhopal plant. This plant was located next to a very densely populated neighbourhood, and heavily trafficked railway station. Locating it near this densely populated area was a direct violation of the 1975 Bhopal Development Plan. This development plan posed that hazardous industries such as the MIC plant be located in a different part of the city that was further away, and downwind, from more densely populated areas. According to one of the authors of the Bhopal Development Plan, &quot;Union Carbide India Limited&#x27;s&quot; initial application for a permit was rejected, yet the company was able to gain approval from centralized governing authorities. In 1982, Carbide&#x27;s auditors had warned of a possible &#x27;runaway reaction&#x27;.

Around midnight on 3 December 1984, gas was accidentally released from the plant, exposing more than 500,000 people to MIC and other chemicals. The Government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 16,000 deaths related to the gas release. It left an estimated 40,000 individuals permanently disabled, maimed, or suffering from serious illness, making it the world&#x27;s worst industrial disaster.

Following the incident, organizations representing the victims in Bhopal filed a U.S. $10 billion injury claim against Union Carbide. Additionally, the Government of India filed its own $3.3 billion claim against the company. Union Carbide&#x27;s response was an offer in the range of $300-$350 million. In 1989 the company paid $470 million to the Indian government as a final settlement. 

Broken down, the total cost of the settlement to Union Carbide&#x27;s expenses was 43 cents per share, an amount criticized by some for its comparison to the annual report post-settlement declaring earnings per share. In that 1988 report, Union Carbide claimed to have had its best year yet, citing a record $4.88 earnings per share (this figure included the 43 cents per share charge from the Bhopal settlement). 

After the settlement, Union Carbide’s parent company divested its entire stake in UCIL. Carbide insists the accident was an act of sabotage by a plant worker. The plant site has not yet been cleaned up. Hazardous chemicals can still be found in the now abandoned site.

Warren Anderson, CEO at the time of the disaster, refused to answer to homicide charges and remained a fugitive from India&#x27;s courts. The U.S. denied several extradition requests. Anderson died on 29 September 2014 in Florida. Seven UCC employees were convicted of criminal negligence in 2010 and fined $2,000 each.

==1985 West Virginia gas leak==
The year after the Bhopal disaster, a faulty valve at the UC plant in Institute, West Virginia caused a large cloud of gas that injured six employees and caused almost 200 nearby residents to seek medical treatment for respiratory and skin irritation. Union Carbide blamed the leak of aldicarb oxime (made from MIC but does not contain any MIC itself), the main ingredient in the popular farm pesticide Temik, on a valve failure after a buildup of pressure in a storage tank containing 500 pounds of the chemical. A company spokesman insisted that the aldicarb oxime leak &quot;never was a threat to the community.&quot;

==Union Carbide in Australia==
Union Carbide&#x27;s operations in Australia commenced in 1957, when it purchased the plant of the Australian-owned company Timbrol Ltd. The Timbrol factory was on the shore of Homebush Bay in the Sydney suburb of Rhodes. Homebush Bay is on the Parramatta River which flows into Sydney Harbour. Tibrol produced phenol, the insecticides chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT, and the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Union Carbide continued the production of the 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T until 1976 and chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT until 1983. Union Carbide also commenced the production of bisphenol A in 1960 and phenol formaldehyde resins in 1964.

Union Carbide reclaimed land on neighboring properties by depositing spent lime and ash into the adjacent marshes in Homebush Bay. This practice, which had been approved by the Maritime Services Board, ceased in 1970.

Union Carbide ceased operations in Australia in 1985. In 1987, the New South Wales Pollution Control Commission ordered Union Carbide to remediate the site. This work, which cost Union Carbide $30 million, was conducted between 1988 and 1993. The work involved excavation and encapsulation of the contaminated soil.

In 2004, the New South Wales Minister for Planning granted consent for additional remediation of the former Union Carbide site to proceed, including parts of Homebush Bay. Approximately 900,000 tons of soil were excavated from the site, 190,000 tons of soil from the adjacent Allied Feeds site, and approximately 50,000 tons of sediment from the bay. Remediation of the Allied Feeds Site was completed in August 2009, Homebush Bay sediments in August 2010, and the Union Carbide site in March 2011. The cost of the remediation work was $35M for the Allied Feeds site, and $100 million for Union Carbide site and Homebush Bay sediments.

==New York headquarters building==
The former Union Carbide headquarters building, at 270 Park Avenue in New York City, was a 52-story modernist office building designed by architectural firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and completed in 1960. The company relocated its headquarters to Danbury, Connecticut in 1983, to a newly-built complex known as the Union Carbide Corporate Center. 270 Park Avenue later became the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase. The building was demolished and replaced with a new tower serving as the consolidated headquarters for JPMorgan Chase. At tall, the Union Carbide Building was the tallest building in the world ever voluntarily demolished at the time.

<text>Central Russia is, broadly, the various areas in European Russia. 

Historically, the area of Central Russia varied based on the purpose for which it is being used. It may, for example, refer to European Russia (except the North Caucasus and Kaliningrad).

The 1967 book by Stephen P. Dunn and Ethel Dunn &quot;The Peasants of Central Russia&quot; defines the area as the territory from Novgorod Oblast to the north to the border with Ukraine in the south and from Smolensk Oblast to the west and Volga to the east. A review of the book clarifies that this concept is treated in the book as the historical and ethnographical one: this is the historical area of Great Russians.

<doc id="301370" wikidata="Q272877" url="?curid=301370" title="Fernando Botero">
<text>Fernando Botero Angulo (19 April 1932 – 15 September 2023) was a Colombian figurative artist and sculptor. His signature style, also known as &quot;Boterismo&quot;, depicts people and figures in large, exaggerated volume, which can represent political criticism or humor, depending on the piece. He was considered the most recognized and quoted artist from Latin America in his lifetime, and his art can be found in highly visible places around the world, such as Park Avenue in New York City and the Champs-Élysées in Paris, at different times.

Self-styled &quot;the most Colombian of Colombian artists&quot;, Botero came to national prominence when he won the first prize at the Salón de Artistas Colombianos in 1958. He began creating sculptures after moving to Paris in 1973, achieving international recognition with exhibitions around the world by the 1990s. His art is collected by many major international museums, corporations, and private collectors, sometimes selling for millions of dollars. In 2012, he received the International Sculpture Center&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Fernando Botero was born in Medellín on 19 April 1932. His father, David Botero, a salesman who traveled by horseback, died when Fernando was four. His mother, Flora Angulo, worked as a seamstress to support the family. An uncle took a major role in his life. Although isolated from art as presented in museums and other cultural institutes, Botero was influenced by the Baroque style of the colonial churches and the city life of Medellín while growing up.

Botero received his primary education at the Ateneo Antioqueño and, thanks to a scholarship, he continued his secondary education at the Jesuit School of Bolívar. In 1944, Botero&#x27;s uncle sent him to a school for matadors for two years. Some of his earlier drawings were inspired by the bullfight scene. He sold his first painting for two pesos, thanks to a merchant who allowed him to display it in the window of his shop. He spoke with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, during an interview in November 2000, and explained that he lost the money he got for the painting and thus, his brothers never believed him. His love of drawing nudes caused problems with his Roman Catholic education. He was expelled from school after defending Pablo Picasso’s art in an essay. In 1948, Botero at the age of 16 had his first illustrations published in the Sunday supplement of &quot;El Colombiano&quot;, one of the most important newspapers in Medellín. He used the money he was paid to attend high school at the Liceo de Marinilla de Antioquia.

===Career===
Botero&#x27;s work was first exhibited in 1948, in a group show along with other artists from the region. From 1949 to 1950, Botero worked as a set designer, before moving to Bogotá in 1951. Young Botero also worked as a newspaper illustrator to support his artistic interests and before attending San Fernando Academy. The Pérez Art Museum Miami acquired a still life picture of Botero&#x27;s early days of career depicting apples, an influence of European art historical movements and 20th-century painters. His first one-man show was held at the Galería Leo Matiz in Bogotá, a few months after his arrival.

In 1952, using his gallery earnings, Botero sailed to Europe. He arrived in Barcelona and then moved on to Madrid. In Madrid, Botero studied at the Academia de San Fernando and was a frequent visitor to the Prado Museum, where he copied works by Goya and Velázquez. He sold his copies on the streets to make money. 

In 1953, Botero moved to Paris, where he spent most of his time in the Louvre, studying the works there. He lived in Florence from 1953 to 1954, studying the works of Renaissance masters. Later in life, he lived most of the time in Paris, but spent one month a year in his native city of Medellín. He had more than 50 exhibitions in major cities worldwide, and his work commands selling prices in the millions of dollars. In 1958, he won the ninth edition of the Salón de Artistas Colombianos.

Around 1964, Botero made his first attempts to create sculptures.
Due to financial constraints preventing him from working with bronze, he made his sculptures with acrylic resin and sawdust. A notable example during this time was &quot;Small Head (Bishop)&quot; in 1964, a sculpture painted with great realism. The material was too porous, so he abandoned this method. He returned to sculpture &quot;with enthusiasm&quot; in Italy in the mid-1970s and exhibited his characteristic bronze sculptures for the first time at the Grand Palais in Paris in 1977.

On 10 June 1995, while his son Fernando Botero Zea was serving as Minister of Defence, a bomb containing 10 kg of dynamite was placed underneath one of Botero&#x27;s bronze sculptures on display in Medellín&#x27;s Plaza San Antonio. The resulting explosion killed 23 people and injured 200 more; the perpetrators were never identified. A horrified Botero decided that the damaged sculpture should be left in place as a &quot;monument to the country&#x27;s imbecility and criminality&quot; and donated an intact replica to stand alongside it. 

In 2004, Botero exhibited a series of 27 drawings and 23 paintings dealing with the violence in Colombia from 1999 through 2004. He donated the works to the National Museum of Colombia, where they were first exhibited.
In 2005, Botero gained considerable attention for his &quot;Abu Ghraib&quot; series, which was exhibited first in Europe. He based the works on reports of United States forces&#x27; abuses of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison during the Iraq War. Beginning with an idea he had had on a plane journey, Botero produced more than 85 paintings and 100 drawings in exploring this concept and &quot;painting out the poison&quot;. The series was exhibited at two United States locations in 2007, including Washington, DC. Botero said he would not sell any of the works, but would donate them to museums. In 2009, the Berkeley Art Museum acquired (as a gift from the artist) 56 paintings and drawings from the &quot;Abu Ghraib&quot; series, which can be seen online. Selections from the series have been regularly included in the museum&#x27;s annual Art for Human Rights exhibitions.

In 2006, after having focused exclusively on the &quot;Abu Ghraib&quot; series for over 14 months, Botero returned to the themes of his early life such as the family and motherhood. In his &quot;Une Famille&quot; Botero represented the Colombian family, a subject often painted in the 1970s and 1980s. In his &quot;Maternity&quot;, Botero repeated a composition he had already painted in 2003. 

In 2008, he exhibited the works of his &quot;The Circus&quot; collection, featuring 20 works in oil and watercolor. In a 2010 interview, Botero said that he was ready for other subjects: &quot;After all this, I always return to the simplest things: still lifes.&quot;

==Style==
While his work includes still-lifes and landscapes, Botero concentrated on situational portraiture. His paintings and sculptures are united by their proportionally exaggerated, or &quot;fat&quot; figures, as he once referred to them.

Botero explained his use of these &quot;large people&quot;, as they are often called by critics, in the following way:

An artist is attracted to certain kinds of form without knowing why. You adopt a position intuitively; only later do you attempt to rationalize or even justify it.Botero’s work, &quot;Still Life with Mandolin&quot;, marked the beginning of his stylistic development in painting enlarged figures. It became his trademark. During a November 2000 interview, he said about it:I was drawing a mandolin, and I made the sound hole very small, which made the mandolin look gigantic. I saw that making the details small made the form monumental. So, in my figures, the eyes, the mouth are all small and the exterior form is huge.During 1956 – 1958, Botero had exhibitions in both Washington D.C. and Mexico City. Despite selling almost all of his paintings, he didn&#x27;t gain favor of critics. His reputation improved after the New York Museum of Modern Art obtained his painting, &quot;Mona Lisa, Age Twelve&quot;, in 1961.

Though he spent only one month a year in Colombia, he considered himself the &quot;most Colombian artist living&quot;, due to his isolation from the international trends of the art world.

==Donations==

Botero donated a large number of artworks to museums in Bogotá and his hometown, Medellín. In 2000, Botero donated 123 pieces of his work and 85 pieces from his personal collection to the Museo Botero in Bogotá, including works by Chagall, Picasso, Robert Rauschenberg, and the French impressionists. He donated 119 pieces to the Museum of Antioquia, including 23 bronze sculptures for the square in front of the museum, which became known as Botero Plaza.

In response to the Colombian peace process, Botero sculpted and donated &quot;La paloma de la paz&quot; (2016) to the Government of Colombia to commemorate the signing and ratification of the agreement.

==Personal life==
Botero was married twice. With his first wife, (1935–2019), later director of the Colombian Institute of Culture (Colcultura), he had three children: Fernando, Lina, and Juan Carlos. They divorced in 1960 and, the following year, Botero moved to New York City, where he lived for a dozen years before settling in Paris.

In 1964 Botero began living with Cecilia Zambrano. They had a son, Pedro, who was killed in 1974 in a car accident when they were vacationing in Spain. While traveling between Sevilla and Córdoba, a truck lost control and crashed into their car. Pedro was four years old. Botero survived, but he lost the phalanx of the right little finger. Botero&#x27;s work, &quot;Pedrito a Caballo&quot;, was inspired by his late son and was painted in the months following the accident. Botero and Zambrano separated in 1975.

His home city, Medellín, is also known for being the home of Pablo Escobar, Colombia’s most famous drug lord. After the death of Escobar, Botero found out that two of his paintings were in Escobar&#x27;s possession, and this angered him. Botero painted the death of Escobar on his paintings, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Death of Pablo Escobar,&quot; and &quot;Pablo Escobar Dead.&quot; Unfortunately, the violence in the city didn’t end after the drug lord’s death. Botero was kidnapped while in the city in 1994, and in 1995, one of his statues, &quot;The Bird of Peace&quot;, was blown up in a bomb attack.

Botero&#x27;s second wife was the Greek artist Sophia Vari with whom he resided in Paris and Monte Carlo until her death on 5 May 2023 The couple also had a house in Pietrasanta, Italy. Botero&#x27;s 80th birthday was commemorated with an exhibition of his works at Pietrasanta. 

Botero died from complications of pneumonia on 15 September 2023, at age 91, in Monaco.

==Popular culture==
Botero&#x27;s 1964 painting &quot;Pope Leo X (after Raphael)&quot; has found a second life as a popular internet meme. It is typically seen with the caption &quot;y tho&quot;.

Mario Vargas Llosa&#x27;s 2023 novel &quot;Le dedico mi silencio&quot; uses Botero&#x27;s 1979 painting &quot;Los músicos&quot; as its cover illustration.

<doc id="301373" wikidata="Q76973" url="?curid=301373" title="Yaws">
<text>Yaws is a tropical infection of the skin, bones, and joints caused by the spirochete bacterium &quot;Treponema pallidum pertenue&quot;. The disease begins with a round, hard swelling of the skin, in diameter. The center may break open and form an ulcer. This initial skin lesion typically heals after 3–6 months. After weeks to years, joints and bones may become painful, fatigue may develop, and new skin lesions may appear. The skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet may become thick and break open. The bones (especially those of the nose) may become misshapen. After 5 years or more, large areas of skin may die, leaving scars.
Yaws is spread by direct contact with the fluid from a lesion of an infected person. The contact is usually of a nonsexual nature. The disease is most common among children, who spread it by playing together. Other related treponemal diseases are bejel (&quot;T. pallidum endemicum&quot;), pinta (&quot;T. carateum&quot;), and syphilis (&quot;T. p. pallidum&quot;). Yaws is often diagnosed by the appearance of the lesions. Blood antibody tests may be useful, but cannot separate previous from current infections. Polymerase chain reaction is the most accurate method of diagnosis.
No vaccine has yet been found. Prevention is, in part, done by curing those who have the disease, thereby decreasing the risk of transmission. Where the disease is common, treating the entire community is effective. Improving cleanliness and sanitation also decreases spread. Treatment is typically with antibiotics, including azithromycin by mouth or benzathine penicillin by injection. Without treatment, physical deformities occur in 10% of cases.
Yaws is common in at least 13 tropical countries as of 2012. Almost 85% of infections occurred in three countries—Ghana, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands. The disease only infects humans. Efforts in the 1950s and 1960s by the World Health Organization decreased the number of cases by 95%. Since then, cases have increased, but with renewed efforts to globally eradicate the disease by 2020. In 1995, the number of people infected was estimated at more than 500,000. In 2016, the number of reported cases was 59,000. Although one of the first descriptions of the disease was made in 1679 by Willem Piso, archaeological evidence suggests that yaws may have been present among human ancestors as far back as 1.6 million years ago.

==Signs and symptoms==
Yaws primarily occurs in children, most frequently in those aged 6–10.

Yaws is classified as primary, secondary, and tertiary; this can be clinically useful, but infected patients often have a mix of stages.

Within 9–90 days (but usually about 21 days) of infection, a painless but distinctive &quot;mother yaw&quot; nodule appears. Initially reddened and inflamed, it may become a papilloma, which can then become an ulcer, possibly with a yellow crust. Mother yaws are most commonly found on the legs and ankles, and are rarely found on the genitals (unlike syphilis). The mother yaw enlarges and becomes warty in appearance. Nearby &quot;daughter yaws&quot; may also appear simultaneously. This primary stage resolves completely, with scarring, within 3–6 months. The scar is often pigmented.

The secondary stage occurs months to two years later (but usually 1–2 months later), and may thus begin when the mother yaw has not yet healed. It happens when the bacterium spreads in the blood and lymph. It begins as multiple, pinhead-like papules; these initial lesions grow and change in appearance and may last weeks before healing, with or without scarring.

Secondary yaws typically shows widespread skin lesions that vary in appearance, including &quot;crab yaws&quot; (areas of skin of abnormal color) on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (named for the crab-like gait they cause people with painful soles to assume). These may show desquamation. These secondary lesions frequently ulcerate and are then highly infectious, but heal after 6 months or more.

Secondary yaws affects the skin and bones. The most common bone-related problem is periostitis, an inflammation around the bone, often occurs in the bones of the fingers and the long bones of the lower arms and legs, causing swollen fingers and limbs. This causes pain at night and thickening of the affected bones (periostitis). About 75% of infected children surveyed in Papua New Guinea reported joint pain. Swollen lymph nodes, fever, and malaise are also common.

After primary and secondary yaws (and possibly, in some cases, without these phases), a latent infection develops. Within five years (rarely, within ten years) it can relapse and become active again, causing further secondary lesions, which may infect others. These relapse lesions are most commonly found around the armpits, mouth, and anus.

An estimated 10% of people with yaws formerly were thought to develop tertiary disease symptoms, but more recently, tertiary yaws has been less frequently reported.

Tertiary yaws can include gummatous nodules. It most commonly affects the skin. The skin of the palms and soles may thicken (hyperkeratosis). Nodules ulcerating near joints can cause tissue death. Periostitis can be much more severe. The shinbones may become bowed (saber shin) from chronic periostitis.

Yaws may or may not have cardiovascular or neurological effects; definitive evidence is lacking.

===Rhinopharyngitis mutilans===
Rhinopharyngitis mutilans, also known as gangosa, is a destructive ulcerative condition that usually originates about the soft palate and spreads into the hard palate, nasopharynx, and nose, resulting in mutilating cicatrices, and outward to the face, eroding intervening bone, cartilage, and soft tissues. It occurs in the late stages of yaws, usually 5 to 10 years after the first symptoms of infection. This is now rare. Very rarely, yaws may cause bone spurs in the upper jaw near the nose (gondou); gondou was rare even when yaws was a common disease.

==Cause==
Yaws is caused by infection with bacteria of the &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; subspecies &quot;pertenue&quot;. The initial yaws wound contains infectious bacteria, which are passed onto others through skin-to-skin contact, typically during play or other normal childhood interactions. Early (primary and secondary) yaws lesions have a higher bacterial load, thus are more infectious. Both papillomas and ulcers are infectious. Infectivity is thought to last 12–18 months after infection, longer if a relapse occurs. Early yaws lesions are often itchy, and more lesions may form along lines that are scratched. Yaws may be evolving less conspicuous lesions. After a new person is infected, an infectious papilloma will form within 9–90 days (on average 21 days).

&quot;T. pallidum pertenue&quot; has been identified in nonhuman primates (baboons, chimpanzees, and gorillas) and experimental inoculation of human beings with a simian isolate causes yaws-like disease. However, no evidence exists of cross-transmission between human beings and primates, but more research is needed to discount the possibility of a yaws animal reservoir in nonhuman primates.

==Diagnosis==
Most often the diagnosis is made clinically. Dark field microscopy of samples taken from early lesions (particularly ulcerative lesions) may show the responsible bacteria; the spirochaetes are only 0.3 μm wide by 6–20 μm long, so light-field microscopy does not suffice.

A microscopic examination of a biopsy of a yaw may show skin with clear epidermal hyperplasia (a type of skin thickening) and papillomatosis (a type of surface irregularity), often with focal spongiosis (an accumulation of fluid in a specific part of the epidermis). Immune system cells, neutrophils and plasma cells, accumulate in the skin, in densities that may cause microabscesses.

Warthin–Starry or Levaditi silver stains selectively stain &quot;T. pallidum&quot;, and direct and indirect immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase tests can detect polyclonal antibodies to &quot;T. pallidum&quot;s. Histology often shows some spatial features that distinguish yaws from syphilis (syphilis is more likely to be found in the dermis, not the epidermis, and shows more endothelial cell proliferation and vascular obliteration).

Blood-serum (serological) tests are increasingly done at the point of care. They include a growing range of treponemal and nontreponemal assays. Treponemal tests are more specific, and are positive for anyone who has ever been infected with yaws; they include the &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; particle agglutination assay. Nontreponemal assays can be used to indicate the progress of an infection and a cure, and positive results weaken and may become negative after recovery, especially after a case is treated early. They include the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL; requires microscopy) and rapid plasma (RPR; naked-eye result) tests, both of which flocculate patient-derived antibodies with antigens.

Serological tests cannot distinguish yaws from the closely related syphilis; no test distinguishing yaws from syphilis is widely available. The two genomes differ by about 0.2%. PCR and DNA sequencing can distinguish the two. There are also no common blood tests that distinguish among the four treponematoses: syphilis (Treponema pallidum pallidum), yaws (Treponema pallidum pertenue), bejel (Treponema pallidum endemicum), and pinta (Treponema carateum).

&quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot; infections can cause skin conditions that mimic primary yaws. People infected with &quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot; lesions may or may not also have latent yaws, and thus may or may not test positive on serological tests. This was discovered in the mid-2010s. It seems that a recently diverged strain of &quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot; has evolved from being a sexually transmitted infection to being a skin ulcer pathogen that looks like yaws.

Yaws has been reported in nonendemic countries.

==Treatment==
Treatment is normally by a single intramuscular injection of long-acting benzathine benzylpenicillin, or less commonly by a course of other antibiotics, such as azithromycin or tetracycline tablets. Penicillin has been the front-line treatment since at least the 1960s, but there is no solid evidence of the evolution of penicillin resistance in yaws.

The historical strategy for the eradication of yaws (1952–1964) was:
Benzathine benzylpenicillin requires a cold chain and staff who can inject it, and there is a small risk of anaphylaxis. It was also not reliably available during the 2010s; there have been supply shortages.

In the 2010s, a single oral dose of azithromycin was shown to be as effective as intramuscular penicillin. Unlike penicillin, there is strong evidence that yaws is evolving antibiotic resistance to azithromycin; there are two known mutations in the bacterium, each of which can cause resistance and make the treatment ineffective. This has threatened eradication efforts.

Within 8–10 hours of penicillin treatment, bacteria can no longer be found in lesion biopsies. Primary and secondary lesions usually heal in 2–4 weeks; bone pain may improve within two days. If treated early enough, bone deformities may reverse and heal. Primary and secondary stage lesions may heal completely, but the destructive changes of tertiary yaws are largely irreversible.

If lesions do not heal, or RPR test results do not improve, this may indicate treatment failure or re-infection; the treatment is typically repeated. WHO guidelines say that any presumed treatment failures at 4 weeks require macrolide resistance testing.

==Epidemiology==

Yaws is typically found in humid tropical forest regions in South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania.

Yaws primarily affects children, with up to 80% of cases in those under 15 years of age, and peak incidence in children aged six to ten. Boys and girls are impacted equally.

It is more common in remote areas, where access to treatment is poorer. It is associated with poverty and poor sanitation facilities and personal hygiene.

Worldwide, almost 85% of yaws cases are in Ghana, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. Rates in sub-Saharan Africa are low but tend to be concentrated in specific populations. , it is estimated that about 89 million people live in yaws-endemic areas, but data are poor, and this is likely an overestimate.

In the early 1900s, yaws was very common; in sub-Saharan Africa, it was more frequently treated than malaria, sometimes making up more than half of treatments.

Mass treatment campaigns in the 1950s reduced the worldwide prevalence from 50 to 150 million to fewer than 2.5 million; however, during the 1970s there were outbreaks in South-East Asia, and there have been continued sporadic cases in South America. , it was unclear how many people worldwide were currently infected.

From 2008 to 2012, 13 countries reported over 300,000 new cases to the WHO. There was no system for certifying local elimination of yaws, and it is not known whether the lack of reports from some countries is because they stopped having yaws cases or because they stopped reporting them. It is estimated that if there is not an active surveillance programme, there is less than a 1-in-2 chance that a country will successfully report yaws cases (if it gets them) in over three-quarters of countries with a history of yaws. These countries are thought to need international assistance to mount effective surveillance.

==History==

Examination of remains of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; from Kenya, which are about 1.6 million years old, has revealed signs typical of yaws. The genetic analysis of the yaws causative bacteria—&quot;Treponema pallidum pertenue&quot;—has led to the conclusion that yaws is the most ancient of the four known &quot;Treponema&quot; diseases. All other &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot; subspecies probably evolved from &quot;Treponema pallidum pertenue&quot;. Yaws is believed to have originated in tropical areas of Africa and spread to other tropical areas of the world via immigration and the slave trade. The latter is likely the way it was introduced to Europe from Africa in the 15th century. The first unambiguous description of yaws was made by the Dutch physician Willem Piso. Yaws was clearly described in 1679 among African slaves by Thomas Sydenham in his epistle on venereal diseases, although he thought that it was the same disease as syphilis. The causative agent of yaws was discovered in 1905 by Aldo Castellani in ulcers of patients from Ceylon.

The current English name is believed to be of Carib origin, from &quot;yaya&quot;, meaning sore.

Towards the end of the Second World War, yaws became widespread in the North of Malaya under Japanese occupation. After the country was liberated, the population was treated for yaws by injections of salvarsan, of which there was a great shortage, so only those with stage 1 were treated.
==Eradication==


A series of WHO yaws control efforts, which began shortly after the creation of the WHO in 1948, succeeded in eradicating the disease locally from many countries, but have not lasted long enough to eradicate it globally. The Global Control of Treponematoses (TCP) programme by the WHO and the UNICEF was launched in 1952 and continued until 1964. A 1953 questionnaire-based estimate was that there were 50–150 million yaws cases in 90 countries. The global prevalence of yaws and the other endemic treponematoses, bejel and pinta, was reduced by the Global Control of Treponematoses (TCP) programme between 1952 and 1964 from about 50 million cases to about 2.5 million (a 95% reduction). However, &quot;premature integration of yaws and other endemic treponematoses activities into weak primary health-care systems, and the dismantling of the vertical eradication programmes after 1964, led to the failure to finish with the remaining 5% of cases&quot; and also led to a resurgence of yaws in the 1970s, with the largest number of case found in the Western Africa region. Following the cessation of this program, resources, attention and commitment for yaws gradually disappeared and yaws remained at a low prevalence in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas with sporadic outbreaks. With few cases, mainly affecting poor, remote communities with little access to treatment, yaws became poorly known, yaws knowledge and skills died out even among health professionals, and yaws eradication was not seen as a high priority. Although a single injection of long-acting penicillin or other beta lactam antibiotic cures the disease and is widely available and the disease highly localised, many eradication campaigns ended in complacency and neglect; even in areas where transmission was successfully interrupted, re-introduction from infected areas occurred. Yaws eradication remained a priority in South-East Asia. In 1995, the WHO estimated 460,000 worldwide cases.

In the Philippines, yaws stopped being listed as a notifiable disease in 1973; as of 2020, it is still present in the country.

India implemented a successful yaws eradication campaign that resulted in the 2016 certification by the WHO that India was free of yaws. In 1996 there were 3,571 yaws cases in India; in 1997 after a serious elimination effort began the number of cases fell to 735. By 2003 the number of cases was 46. The last clinical case in India was reported in 2003 and the last latent case in 2006; certification by the WHO was achieved in 2016.

In 2012 the WHO officially targeted yaws for eradication by 2020 following the development of orally administered azithromycin as a treatment, but missed that target. The Morges approach (named after Morges, Switzerland, where a meeting on it was held) involved mass treatment with azithromycin. This was safe, but ran into problems with antibiotic resistance, and did not fully interrupt transmission.

The discovery that oral antibiotic azithromycin can be used instead of the previous standard, injected penicillin, was tested on Lihir Island from 2013 to 2014; a single oral dose of the macrolide antibiotic reduced disease prevalence from 2.4% to 0.3% at 12 months. The WHO now recommends both treatment courses (oral azithromycin and injected penicillin), with oral azithromycin being the preferred treatment.

, there were 15 countries known to be endemic for yaws, with the recent discovery of endemic transmission in Liberia and the Philippines. In 2020, 82,564 cases of yaws were reported to the WHO, and 153 cases were confirmed. The majority of the cases are reported from Papua New Guinea and with over 80% of all cases coming from one of three countries in the 2010–2013 period: Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Ghana. A WHO meeting report in 2018 estimated the total cost of elimination to be US$175 million (excluding Indonesia).

In the South-East Asian Regional Office of the WHO, regional eradication efforts are focused on the remaining endemic countries in this region (Indonesia and East Timor) after India was declared free of yaws in 2016.

Although yaws is highly localized and eradication may be feasible, humans may not be the only reservoir of infection.

<text>Winwick is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Warrington, Cheshire, England. Located within the historic boundaries of Lancashire, it is situated about three miles north of Warrington town centre, nearby is junction 22 of the M6 and Junction 9 of the M62. Winwick also borders Newton-le-Willows and Burtonwood.

According to the 2001 Census, the civil parish had a population of 4,366.

==History==

King Oswald of Northumbria is believed to have been killed in the Winwick area and the parish church, dedicated to him, was reputedly located with guidance from the &quot;Winwick Pig&quot;, a carving of which can still be seen on the church wall. Richard Sherlock was the incumbent at Winwick for some thirty years in the seventeenth century, and Thomas Wilson, Bishop of Sodor and Man, spent his early years in the care of Sherlock at Winwick.

At the time of the Domesday Survey (1086), the village itself was also known as St Oswalds. This was little more than four hundred years after the death of Oswald. In the church, the remains of a 7th-century stone cross with an engraving of the reputed demise of Oswald can be seen.

Winwick was the site of the battle of Winwick in the second English Civil War on 19 August 1648, where Oliver Cromwell defeated a mainly Scottish Royalist army.

The Captain of the , Edward Smith, married Sarah Eleanor Pennington on 13 January 1887 at St Oswald&#x27;s Church.

=== Rail crash ===

In 1934, Winwick was the site of an accident in which 11 people were killed, and 19 people were injured. Another accident occurred in 1967, but there were no fatalities or serious injuries.

==Winwick today==
Although Winwick is next to two motorways, it remains a relatively compact village set in a rural location. The village also includes a council estate and Winwick Park, with houses ranging from £200,000 to £500,000. Winwick previously had a post office and currently has a community leisure centre, a pub (The Swan), a beauty salon and a hairdresser as well as other shops. 

It is also home to the, highly popular, annual Winwick Carnival which always takes place on the 3rd Saturday in July on the playing fields alongside the aforementioned community leisure centre. It hosts, as part of the day’s activities, a funfair, a diverse range of food and craft stalls and other entertainment such as, a (family pet) dog show, games and/or arena acts for all age-groups.

A car boot sale site located on green belt land that also occasionally hosts a circus and touring fair also occurs.

Winwick Hospital, a large Victorian mental asylum, closed down in 1997. A smaller hospital called Hollins Park is currently situated on the site: Hollins Park Hospital is also the headquarters for North West Boroughs Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.

Winwick has a major business park and industrial estate, Winwick Quay Business Park, located on Calver Road just off the main A49.

==Sport==
Winwick Athletic F.C. is a junior football club that has become a very well known and highly successful, initially as an FA Charter Standard Development Club from 2006 (in fact, winning the Lancashire County and North West Regional Awards in 2007, 2009 and 2011 as well as then also winning the prestigious FA Charter Standard National Club of the Year Award in 2009). In January 2013, Winwick Athletic F.C. became an FA Charter Standard Community Club, which is the highest level possible for an FA Grassroots Football Club, and now, as of 1 June 2014, has become a Nike Partner Club.

<doc id="301379" wikidata="Q4361259" url="?curid=301379" title="Penketh">
<text>Penketh is a civil parish and suburb of Warrington in the Borough of Warrington, Cheshire, England. It is located about west of Warrington town centre. It has a population of 8,699. It is in the historic county of Lancashire. The emblem/badge of Penketh is three kingfishers.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Penketh&quot; is first attested in 1243 as &quot;Penket&quot; and similar forms. The name is derived from two Common Brittonic words: *&quot;penno-&quot; (head) and *&quot;kēto-&quot; (trees), corresponding to modern Welsh (the place-name &quot;Pencoed&quot; is found widely in Wales). Thus the name once meant &quot;end of the wood&quot;, suggesting that the parish was at one time on the outskirts of a forest.

==History==
Penketh was originally part of Prescot parish but became a chapelry and then a separate parish. It grew due to the crossing over the Mersey at Fiddlers Ferry and the building of the Sankey Canal. The area was mainly rural and agricultural until well into the 20th century, though a tannery and boatyard were established in the 19th century.

The last 50 years has seen the area transformed into a large residential suburb.

==Governance==
Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, the parish has a Parish Council and is a ward of Warrington Borough. It is in Warrington South constituency of the United Kingdom Parliament. Until the major local government reorganisation of 1974, Penketh was part of Warrington Rural District.

==Industry==
The former tannery and boatyard were the only major industries in Penketh. Fiddlers Ferry Power Station dominates Penketh, though it is in Cuerdley parish.

==Churches==
There is a parish church (St Paul&#x27;s, Church of England), and a Catholic church (St Joseph&#x27;s). There is a strong nonconformist tradition as exemplified by the Methodist chapel in Chapel Road. The Quakers were well represented at one time; the Meeting House was the present village hall on Meeting Lane.

==Schools==
The secondary schools in the area are Penketh High School and St Gregory&#x27;s Catholic High School (which isn&#x27;t actually in Penketh). The primary schools in the area are Penketh Community Primary School (a feeder school for Penketh High School), Penketh South Primary School, St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School and St Vincent&#x27;s Catholic Primary School.

==Transport==
Railway stations in the area include local services from Sankey for Penketh on the Liverpool to Manchester Line (with express services along this route available from Warrington Central), as well as Warrington Bank Quay on the West Coast Main Line. Frequent buses link Penketh with Warrington town centre: it is the terminus for Warrington&#x27;s Own Buses (routes 30, 30B, 31 and 32A), and the north of Penketh is also served by Warrington&#x27;s Own Buses routes 14 and 15. Arriva North West inter-urban services also serve the main road through Penketh, heading towards Widnes and Runcorn (route 110) and to Huyton and Liverpool (route 7). Penketh is on the A562 road linking Warrington with the Silver Jubilee Bridge. The nearest airports are Liverpool and Manchester.

==Business Park==
Penketh Business Park (actually located in Great Sankey) is a large 6.5-acre business park in the area located off Liverpool Road. The business park consists of mixed used businesses across 30 warehouses between 400 square feet and 44,500 square feet in size, as well as 21 storage units and a small parcel of land. The business park is most well known for its large indoor Skate Park named Ramp1 which temporarily closed in June 2023, reopening in February 2024, other businesses operating out of this business park include a gym (Ascendancy Fitness Gym), a metal fabrications business M C C Fabrications, and a landscape business (EDR Landscapes).

<doc id="301380" wikidata="Q62877" url="?curid=301380" title="James H. Wilkinson">
<text>James Hardy Wilkinson FRS (27 September 1919 – 5 October 1986) was a prominent figure in the field of numerical analysis, a field at the boundary of applied mathematics and computer science particularly useful to physics and engineering.

==Education==
Born in Strood, England, he won a Foundation Scholarship to Sir Joseph Williamson&#x27;s Mathematical School in Rochester. He studied the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as Senior Wrangler.

==Career==
Taking up war work in 1940, he began working on ballistics but transferred to the National Physical Laboratory in 1946, where he worked with Alan Turing on the ACE computer project. Later, Wilkinson&#x27;s interests took him into the numerical analysis field, where he discovered many significant algorithms.

==Awards and honours==
Wilkinson received the Turing Award in 1970 &quot;for his research in numerical analysis to facilitate the use of the high-speed digital computer, having received special recognition for his work in computations in linear algebra and &#x27;backward&#x27; error analysis.&quot; In the same year, he also gave the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) John von Neumann Lecture.

Wilkinson also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1973.

He was elected as a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society in 1974 for his pioneering work in computer science.

The James H. Wilkinson Prize in Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing, established in 1982 by SIAM, and J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, established in 1991, are named in his honour.

In 1987, Wilkinson won the Chauvenet Prize of the Mathematical Association of America, for his paper &quot;The Perfidious Polynomial&quot;.

==Personal life==
Wilkinson married Heather Ware in 1945. He died at home of a heart attack on October 5, 1986. His wife and their son survived him, a daughter having predeceased him.
