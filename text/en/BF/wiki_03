<text>Tiantai or T&#x27;ien-t&#x27;ai () is an East Asian Buddhist school of Mahāyāna Buddhism that developed in 6th-century China. Tiantai Buddhism emphasizes the &quot;One Vehicle&quot; (&quot;Ekayāna&quot;) doctrine derived from the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; as well as Mādhyamaka philosophy, particularly as articulated in the works of the 4th patriarch Zhiyi (538–597 CE). Brook Ziporyn, professor of ancient and medieval Chinese religion and philosophy, states that Tiantai Buddhism is &quot;the earliest attempt at a thoroughgoing Sinitic reworking of the Indian Buddhist tradition.&quot; According to Paul Swanson, scholar of Buddhist studies, Tiantai Buddhism grew to become &quot;one of the most influential Buddhist traditions in China and Japan.&quot; 

The name of the school is derived from the fact that Zhiyi lived on Tiantai Mountain, which then became a major center for the tradition. Tiantai in modern simplified Chinese means &quot;platform of the sky&quot;; however, according to traditional Chinese sources such as Zhanran, the &#x27;tai&#x27; refers to stars previously worshipped on the mountain (i.e. Santai.) 

Zhiyi is also regarded as the first major figure to form an indigenous Chinese Buddhist system. Tiantai is sometimes also called &quot;The Lotus School&quot;, after the central role of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; in its teachings. 

During the Sui dynasty, the Tiantai school became one of the leading schools of Chinese Buddhism, with numerous large temples supported by emperors and wealthy patrons. The school&#x27;s influence waned and was revived again through the Tang dynasty and also rose again during the Song dynasty. Chinese Tiantai remains a living tradition to this day, being particularly strong in Hong Kong. 

The Japanese Tendai school is also an influential tradition which branched off from Tiantai during the 9th century, and played a major role in the development of Japanese Buddhism. A Korean offshoot, the Cheontae school, was also established during the 12th century. Furthermore, Tiantai (and its offshoots) were very influential in the development of other forms of East Asian Buddhism, such as Chan and Pure Land.

==History==

Unlike earlier schools of Chinese Buddhism, the Tiantai school was entirely of Chinese origin. The schools of Buddhism that had existed in China prior to the emergence of the Tiantai are generally believed to represent direct transplantations from India, with little modification to their basic doctrines and methods. However, Tiantai grew and flourished as a native Chinese Buddhist school under the 4th patriarch, Zhiyi, who developed an original and extensive Chinese Buddhist system of doctrine and practice through his many treatises and commentaries. The main center of the school was located in Zhejiang province&#x27;s Tiantai Mountain, which also gives the school its name.

Over time, the Tiantai school became doctrinally broad, able to absorb and give rise to other movements within Buddhism, though without any formal structure. The tradition emphasized both scriptural study and meditative practice, and taught the rapid attainment of Buddhahood through observing the mind.

The school is largely based on the teachings of Zhiyi, Zhanran, and Zhili, who lived between the 6th and 11th centuries in China. These teachers took an approach called &quot;classification of teachings&quot; (&quot;panjiao&quot; 判教) in an attempt to harmonize the numerous and often contradictory Buddhist texts that had come into China. This was achieved through a particular interpretation of the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;.

===Early figures===
The Indian Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna is traditionally taken to be the first patriarch of the Tiantai school. Madhyamaka works associated with Nāgārjuna like the &quot;Chung lun&quot; (&quot;Madhyamakaśāstra&quot;; Taishō 1564) and the &quot;Dà zhìdù lùn&quot; (T. no. 1509) are important sources for the Tiantai school.

The sixth century dhyāna master Huiwen () is traditionally considered to be the second patriarch of the Tiantai school. Huiwen studied the works of Nāgārjuna, and is said to have awakened to the profound meaning of Nāgārjuna&#x27;s words: &quot;All conditioned phenomena I speak of as empty, and are but false names which also indicate the mean.&quot;

Huiwen later transmitted his teachings to Chan master Nanyue Huisi (, 515-577), who is traditionally figured as the third patriarch. During meditation, he is said to have realized the &quot;Lotus Samādhi&quot;, indicating enlightenment and Buddhahood. He authored the &quot;Ta Ch&#x27;eng Chih Kuan&quot; (&quot;Mahāyāna-śamatha-vipaśyanā&quot;). 

Huisi then transmitted his teachings to Zhiyi (, 538-597), traditionally figured as the fourth patriarch of Tiantai, who is said to have practiced the Lotus Samādhi and to have become enlightened quickly. He authored many treatises such as explanations of the Buddhist texts, and especially systematic manuals of various lengths which explain and enumerate methods of Buddhist practice and meditation. The above lineage was proposed by Buddhists of later times and do not reflect the popularity of the monks at that time.

===Zhiyi===

Scholars such as Paul L. Swanson consider Zhiyi (Chinese: 智顗, 538–597 CE) to have been the major founder of the Tiantai school as well as one of the greatest Chinese Buddhist philosophers. He was the first to systematize and popularize the complex synthesis of Tiantai doctrine as an original Chinese tradition.

Zhiyi analyzed and organized all the Āgamas and Mahayana sutras into a system of five periods and eight types of teachings. For example, many elementary doctrines and bridging concepts had been taught early in the Buddha&#x27;s advent when the vast majority of the people during his time were not yet ready to grasp the &#x27;ultimate truth&#x27;. These Āgamas were an &quot;upaya&quot;, or skillful means - an example of the Buddha employing his boundless wisdom to lead those people towards the truth. Subsequent teachings delivered to more advanced followers thus represent a more complete and accurate picture of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings, and did away with some of the philosophical &#x27;crutches&#x27; introduced earlier. Zhiyi&#x27;s classification culminated with the Lotus Sutra, which he held to be the supreme synthesis of Buddhist doctrine. The difference on Zhiyi&#x27;s explanation to the &quot;Golden Light Sutra&quot; caused a debate during the Song dynasty.

Zhiyi&#x27;s Tiantai school received much imperial support during the Sui dynasty, because of this, it was the largest Buddhist school at the beginning of the Tang and thus suffered because of its close relationship with the house of Sui.

===Zhanran===

After Zhiyi, Tiantai was eclipsed for a time by newer schools such as the East Asian Yogācāra (&quot;Fǎxiàng-zōng&quot;), and Huayan schools, until the 6th patriarch Jingxi Zhanran (711–782) revived the school and defended its doctrine against rival schools such as the Huayan and Faxiang. The debates between the Faxiang school and the Tiantai school concerning the notion of universal Buddhahood were particularly heated, with the Faxiang school asserting that different beings had different natures and therefore would reach different states of enlightenment, while the Tiantai school argued in favor of the Lotus Sutra teaching of Buddhahood for all beings. Zhanran&#x27;s view of Buddha nature was expanded in his &quot;Jingangpi&quot; or &quot;Diamond Scalpel,&quot; which is the &#x27;locus classicus&#x27; of the doctrine of &quot;the Buddha-nature of Insentient Beings.&quot; According to Shuman Chen, Zhanran:

provides his rationale primarily from the perspective of the all-pervasive quality of Buddha-nature, which he considers synonymous with suchness. This rationale indicates that external tangible objects like water, buildings, and flora, formless sounds and smells, and internal thoughts or ideas all possess Buddha-nature. This is because Sakyamuni Buddha and any other Buddha&#x27;s meritorious qualities in their practice leading to enlightenment and in the resultant realization do not reject anything, instead embracing all. In the Tiantai terminology, the Buddha and all beings mutually include, inter-pervade, and are identical to each other.Zhanran writes:&quot;Every blade of grass, tree, pebble, and particle of dust is perfectly endowed with buddha nature ...The practitioner of the perfect teaching, from beginning to end, knows that ultimate principle is nondual and that there are no objects apart from mind. Who then is sentient? What then is insentient? Within the assembly of the Lotus, there is no discrimination.&quot;

===Post-Tang crisis and Song revival===

After Zhanran, Tiantai declined once again. Brook Ziporyn writes that this period has been seen as the second dark age of Tiantai, a state of crisis &quot;extending from the Tang into the Five Dynasties and Northern Song, an age marked internally by the deterioration of distinctive Tiantai ideas and marked externally by the loss of crucial texts and monastic institutions, especially after the persecution of 845 (a period that saw the increased influence of Chan).&quot;

During this period, Huayan and Chan influences made strong inroads into Tiantai thought. Zhanran&#x27;s disciple and seventh patriarch Daosui, and syncretic figures such as Zhi Yuan (768–844) and Daochang Ningfen all combined Tiantai with Chan ideas (particularly of the Heze school). Daosui (Chinese: 道邃; pinyin: &quot;Dàosuì&quot;), is important because he was the primary teacher of Saichō, the founder of the Japanese Tiantai tradition (known in Japanese as Tendai). Other Tiantai syncretists include Deshao (881–972) who was associated with the Fayen branch of Chan and his student Yongming Yenshou (954–974) who attempted to unify Tiantai, Huayen and Yogacara teachings under a kind of idealism influenced by Zongmi, emphasizing what he called the &quot;one pure formless mind&quot;.

This situation led to the famous debate within the Tiantai school known as the &quot;home mountain&quot; (&quot;shanjia&quot;) vs. &quot;off mountain&quot; (&quot;shanwai&quot;) debate. &quot;Off mountain&quot; supporters, as they were later polemically termed, supported these new doctrines (such as the &quot;one pure mind&quot;) claiming they were originally Tiantai doctrines, while &quot;home mountain&quot; supporters saw the original Tiantai view as different and superior to this new view influenced by Chan and Huayan doctrines (especially by Zongmi&#x27;s works). 

The most eminent figure during this debate was Patriarch Siming Zhili (960–1028), who wrote various commentaries on Zhiyi&#x27;s works and defended the &quot;Home mountain&quot; view. Zhili&#x27;s major criticisms included attacking Chan&#x27;s failure to understand the necessity of the use of words and scriptural study as part of practice as well as criticizing Zongmi&#x27;s view of a pure mind as the buddha-nature, arguing instead that the &quot;three truths&quot; as taught by Zhiyi are the ultimate reality. For Zhili, mind or consciousness has no special status relative to other types of dharmas, such as physical matter.

Over time, Zhili&#x27;s &quot;home mountain&quot; view turned out to be victorious, and his works became part of the orthodox Tiantai canon during the Song dynasty. Ciyun Zunshi (964–1032) was another important figure in this second Tiantai revival. His work focused on the promotion of rituals for lay Buddhists and worked on converting the populace away from using blood, meat and alcohol for funerary and ancestral rites. Ciyi also promoted the practice of adopting local Chinese deities and spirits into the Buddhist religion as &quot;vassals&quot; or &quot;retainers&quot; and strongly promoted repentance rituals.

These two figures were also associated with the popularization of Pure Land practices through the foundation of lay societies (lotus societies, &quot;lianshe&quot;). Tiantai monk Mao Ziyuan (1096?-1166) took this one step further by establishing what became known as the &quot;White Lotus Society&quot; which allowed both men and women to attend together and even to preach and be in charge of society repentance halls as married clergy.

Due to the efforts of these major Tiantai figures, the school became one of the dominant forms of Buddhism during the Song, alongside of Chan.

===Yuan, Ming and Qing===

The defeat of the Song dynasty was a serious blow to Tiantai which suffered another setback during the Yuan dynasty which supported Tibetan Buddhism, while Chan Buddhism continued to grow in popularity while attacking the legitimacy of other schools. This period saw the Tiantai figure Huxi Huaize (fl. 1310) write his polemical treatise &quot;Record of Tiantai&#x27;s Transmission of the Buddha&#x27;s Mind-seal&quot; as an effort to defend the Tiantai tradition against Chan critiques.

The Ming Dynasty saw further religious revivals among the major Chinese Buddhist schools, including Tiantai, particularly under the reign of the Buddhist friendly Wanli Emperor. One of the main figures of the Ming Tiantai Buddhist revival is Miaofeng Zhenjue (1537–1589), who lectured widely and whose students revived ancestral Tiantai monasteries such as Gaoming and Ayuwang. 

Youxi Chuandeng (1554–1628), a student of Miaofeng, was also another important figure who wrote a work entitled &quot;On Nature Including Good and Evil&quot; which presents his ideas on doctrinal classification, the principle of nature-inclusion, and the practice of the Dharma-gate of inherent evil attempting to harmonize these with Confucianism and the thought of the Śūraṃgama Sūtra. Chuandeng was also instrumental in rebuilding Gaoming monastery which had been abandoned by this time.

Tianxi Shoudeng (1607–1675) was one of the most influential teachers and exegetes of Tiantai during the Qing Dynasty.

=== Modern era ===

The most influential figure in modern Tiantai, who carried the Tiantai lineage (specifically the Lingfeng lineage) from the late Qing into the 20th century was Dixian. His student, the monk Tanxu (1875 – 1963), is known for having rebuilt various temples during the Republican era (such as Zhanshan temple in Qingdao) and for preserving the Tiantai lineage into the PRC era. During the Chinese Civil War, various dharma heirs of Dixian moved to Hong Kong, including Tanxu and Baojing. They helped establish the Tiantai tradition in Hong Kong, where it remains a strong living tradition today, being preserved by their dharma heirs. 

Baojing&#x27;s dharma heir, Jueguang, helped establish the Guanzong Temple in Hong Kong and transmitted the lineage to numerous monks from Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan and mainland China. Tanxuan&#x27;s heir, Yongxing, founded Xifang Temple in Hong Kong as well as various temples in Malaysia and the United States (as well as the Texas Buddhist association and its Jade Buddha Temple). Furthermore, other monks from this lineage have helped to reintroduce the Tiantai tradition from Hong Kong back to the rest of mainland China, aiding in the reconstruction of Chinese Buddhism after the reform and opening up period.

The ancient Guoqing Temple at mount Tiantai, which had suffered from neglect and destruction, was renovated at the behest of Zhou Enlai. Guoqing Temple is now a major center of Chinese Tiantai Buddhism as well as remains a place of pilgrimage for Japanese Tendai Buddhists.

==Texts==

The Tiantai school takes the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; (&quot;&quot;) as the main basis, the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot; of Nāgārjuna as the guide, the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; as the support, and the &quot;Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (The Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra in 25,000 Lines) for methods of contemplation. The “Book of the Original Acts that Adorn the Bodhisattva,” (&quot;Pusa yingluo benye jing&quot; T. 24, No. 1485) is also a key text. Tiantai is often termed the ‘Four Sutras One Treatise School’ (四経一論) because of the strong influence of these texts on the tradition.

Apart from these, other classic Mahayana sutras are also important in Tiantai. The &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; is also very highly regarded in Tiantai and it is seen as one of the subtlest and deepest sutras and to belong to the class of &quot;complete&quot; teachings. The &quot;Vimalakīrti Sūtra&quot; is also seen as an important sutra in Tiantai. Zhiyi wrote a commentary on this sutra, the &quot;Wuimo yiji (&quot;維摩義記 T1776). 

Indeed, the Tiantai school&#x27;s study makes use of numerous sources. As noted by Donner and Stevenson:When we examine the early [Tiantai] exegetical and textual record, we find that [Zhiyi] and his successors compiled treatises…for any number of sūtras other than the Lotus, including such long-standing Chinese favorites as the Vimalakīrti, Nirvāṇa, Suvarṇaprabhāsa, and various Pure Land sūtras. Not only is there no evidence that one particular scripture was consistently promoted over others, but [Tang]-period sources indicate that the spiritual descendants of [Zhiyi] realigned [Taintai] doctrine freely in order to accommodate whatever sūtra caught their fancy.

=== Tiantai Treatises ===
In addition to its doctrinal basis in Indian Buddhist texts, the Tiantai school also created its own meditation texts which emphasize the principles of śamatha and vipaśyanā. Of the Tiantai meditation treatises, Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;Concise Śamatha-vipaśyanā&quot; (小止観), &quot;Mahā-śamatha-vipaśyanā&quot; (摩訶止観), and &quot;Six Subtle Dharma Gates&quot; (六妙法門) are the most widely read in China. Rujun Wu identifies the work &quot;Mohe Zhiguan&quot; of Zhiyi as the seminal meditation text of the Tiantai school.

The Major Tiantai treatises studied in the tradition are the following works of Zhiyi:

== Philosophy ==
David Chappell lists the most important Tiantai teachings as being The Threefold Truth and the corresponding Threefold Contemplation, The Fourfold Teachings, The Subtle Dharma, and The Non-conceivable Discernment (or the &quot;Inconceivable Mind&quot;). Brook Ziporyn writes that Tiantai&#x27;s &quot;rigorous theoretical edifice&quot; uses &quot;modes of argumentation and praxis that are derived squarely from Indian Buddhism&quot; but applies these &quot;in the service of ideals and metaphysical conclusions that are rooted deeply in the indigenous philosophical traditions.&quot;

=== The Threefold Truth ===
The Tiantai school&#x27;s main philosophical principle is The Threefold Truth (emptiness, existence, and the middle; 空假中 &quot;kong, jia, zhong&quot;). According to Paul Swanson, this is the &quot;central insight&quot; around which the Tiantai system revolves. This view was developed by Zhiyi&#x27;s reading of Nāgārjuna&#x27;s Madhyamaka philosophy, especially its doctrine of two truths. The Threefold Truth comprises the following:
# All phenomena are empty (&quot;śūnya,&quot; 空 &quot;kong&quot;) of any independent self-nature or essence (&quot;svabhava&quot;), this corresponds to the Mahayana concept of the &quot;ultimate&quot; or real (&quot;paramārtha&quot;) truth and emptiness (&quot;shunyata&quot;) which Zhiyi defines as &quot;the sign of the true nature of reality.&quot;
# Phenomena exist (假, &quot;jia&quot;) in a provisional manner, they can be said to conventionally arise through causes and conditions (i.e. dependent origination). This corresponds to the conventional or mundane truth (&quot;saṁvṛti&quot;) of the classic Mahayana two truths, which Zhiyi glosses as &quot;the twelvefold conditioned co-arising of ignorance&quot; and as &quot;illusory existence&quot;.
# The middle truth (中, &quot;zhong&quot;): phenomena are &quot;both&quot; empty of existence and exist provisionally. According to Dan Lusthaus: &quot;it is ‘middle’ because neither the provisional nor the empty truth about the table fully captures its reality. It is both provisional and empty, and simultaneously neither provisional nor empty. As Zhiyi put it, ‘wondrous being is identical to true emptiness’.&quot; Swanson writes that this is &quot;a simultaneous affirmation of both emptiness and conventional existence as aspects of a single integrated reality.&quot; The middle truth for Zhiyi transcends all dualities and avoid all extremes, such as existence and non-existence, being and emptiness, mundane truth and real truth, or defilement and purity.
While the threefold truth can be explained conceptually in this way, for Zhiyi, the highest and most subtle meaning of the threefold truth is ultimately indescribably and beyond words. It is also fully integrated and inclusive of all the Buddhadharma and of all mundane and ultimate truths as well. According to Zhiyi, &quot;the supreme truth of the middle path&quot; is &quot;the reality of non-duality&quot;, as well as &quot;the enlightened perception of all Buddhas and bodhisattvas.&quot; Zhiyi also states that it is also called &quot;the truth of one reality&quot;, as well as &quot;emptiness&quot; (空 &quot;kong&quot;), &quot;Buddha-nature&quot; (佛性 &quot;fóxìng&quot;), Thusness (Skt. &quot;tathātā,&quot; 如如 ruru), &quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot; (如来藏 rulaizang), and the &quot;Dharmadhatu&quot; (法界 fajie).

According to Paul Swanson, this doctrine arose from the need to make explicit the relationship between the first and second truths of classical Indian Mahayana (an issue which also may have led to the development of Yogacara&#x27;s &quot;three natures&quot;). Zhiyi developed his theory of a threefold truth by drawing on Nāgārjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā,&quot; which explains the two truths as: &quot;We state that whatever is dependent arising, that is emptiness. That is dependent upon convention. That itself is the middle path&quot; (MMK, XXIV.18). Swanson states that this doctrine is a way of expressing three aspects of a single integrated reality. 

Swanson also notes that various scholars have criticized Zhiyi for adding a third &quot;truth&quot;, when no Indian author explains Madhyamaka this way. However, according to Swanson, the major point of Zhiyi&#x27;s analysis is that reality is a single integrated truth (which may be explained with two or three aspects). As such, it is not a deviation from classical Madhyamaka according to Swanson. Swanson thinks that one of the main reasons for this development is that it was a useful device for undoing Chinese misunderstandings of the two truths (such as seeing them as referring to being and non-being, to two separate levels of reality or to an essential reality and its functions). 

==== The Threefold Contemplation ====
The Threefold Truth may be contemplated independently as the &quot;three contemplations&quot;, an important theme in Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;Mo ho chi kuan&quot;. The threefold contemplation, also described as the threefold cessation and insight, consists of what Zhiyi calls a &quot;graded contemplation&quot;:

# &quot;Cessation as insight into the true essence of reality -&quot; This consists in contemplating the emptiness of all phenomena and their lack of own being (&quot;svabhava&quot;). 
# &quot;Cessation as insight into expedient conditions -&quot; This consists in contemplating the conventional existence of all things, i.e. dependent arising or as Zhiyi describes it &quot;the non-emptiness of emptiness&quot;, which means that emptiness is not nothingness. 
# &quot;Cessation as an end to both discriminatory extremes -&quot; A contemplation which is the simultaneous unity of both 1 and 2 and which is totally beyond conceptualization and thought. 
There are different levels of subtlety of this threefold contemplation, the deepest of which is when all three aspects are contemplated as a simultaneously non-dual unity which according to Zhiyi is when all three aspects are &quot;present in one thought&quot; (一心) which is &quot;beyond conceptual understanding&quot;. According to Chappell:The first contemplation involves moving from the world of provisionality to seeing its emptiness, which is a different process from the second contemplation in which we move beyond emptiness and back into an acceptance of the role of provisional existence. Only in the third contemplation do we find the balance involving the previous two insights based on the Middle Path of the One Mind.

=== The One Vehicle ===
A central doctrine of Tiantai is the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;&#x27;s doctrine of the One Vehicle or &quot;ekayāna&quot; (traditional Chinese: 一乘; pinyin: &quot;yīchéng&quot;). This doctrine provided a unifying and inclusive framework which could be used to understand all Buddhist teachings. According to Jacqueline Stone, Zhiyi&#x27;s view of the One Vehicle of the Lotus Sutra is that conventionally, it is &quot;subtle&quot; and &quot;wonderful&quot; in comparison with lesser teachings which are coarse. However this is only true in a relative sense. Ultimately, the Lotus Sutra&#x27;s Subtle Dharma is &quot;not established in comparison to anything else, for there is nothing outside it to which it might be compared.&quot; From this absolute perspective, the Lotus Sutra&#x27;s One Vehicle is &quot;open and integrated&quot; according to Zhiyi, and includes all other Buddhist teachings and skillful means. From the ultimate point of view, all distinctions of &quot;true&quot; and &quot;provisional&quot; are dissolved since all teachings are expressions of the One Vehicle. 

According to Stone, &quot;this is an egalitarian, inclusive reading, in which all teachings in effect become &quot;true&quot;. But from the relative standpoint, a clear distinction is preserved between the &quot;true&quot; and the &quot;provisional&quot;; this is a hierarchical, potentially even exclusive reading, which emphasizes the superiority of the Lotus Sutra over other teachings.&quot;

=== The Unity of the Dharmadhatu ===
Since the three truths are one, and this truth is a single unity, Tiantai thinkers see the whole of reality is as being a single interpenetrating whole, one integrated existence. This holism is described in different ways, such as &quot;the interinclusiveness of the ten realms&quot; or &quot;the interpenetrating unity of all aspects of reality&quot;. According to Swanson, in this view, &quot;everything contains everything else, and the whole contains all things.&quot; Zhiyi illustrates this idea with the simile of the drunk man from the &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra,&quot; who perceives the sun as spinning around due to his condition, but in reality there is just one sun and this is confirmed by sober people. However, Zhiyi also points out that even this idea of &quot;one truth&quot; is just a concept, and as such it is ultimately inadequate, since &quot;each and every truth is inexpressible&quot; and &quot;the one truth actually no truth&quot;.

According to Brook Ziporyn, the Tiantai school&#x27;s holism is derived from an extremely important passage from the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; which states: Only a Buddha together with a Buddha knows the ultimate reality of all things: how they appear, what their natures are, what they&#x27;re made of, what they are capable of, what they are doing, what their causes are, what their conditions are, what their effects are, what their consequences are, and the way in which all these factors from beginning to end are equally ultimate and are ultimately one and the same.Ziporyn argues that this passage points at the idea &quot;that each particular aspect of the world as we see it and feel it is ultimately real, that each one is in fact the Absolute itself, the Buddha-nature, the final fact about the universe&quot; and that &quot;each thing, each appearance, each action&quot; is &quot;the ultimate reality “of ” all other things.&quot;

==== Three Thousand Realms in One Thought Moment ====
One of the ways this doctrine is explained is the idea of &quot;Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought Moment&quot; or &quot;The Presence of All Three Thousand Aspects of Existence as Each Moment of Experience&quot; (一念三千). According to this teaching, the various realms of existence of Buddhist cosmology are all interconnected and interpenetrating. Furthermore, each of these states of existence can be experienced in one&#x27;s own mind, and can therefore be seen as a kind of experience and a way of seeing the world, as well as a realm of rebirth. As Zhiyi writes:One thought [or mind] contains the ten dharma realms. Each dharma realm also contains the ten dharma realms [so there are] one hundred dharma realms. Each dharma realm contains thirty worlds; so one hundred dharma realms contain three thousand worlds. These three thousand worlds are contains in one thought.According to Swanson, the main idea here is that &quot;all reality is interpenetrating and inclusive, so that one short thought contains all of reality.&quot; Jacqueline Stone explains this as the idea that an any single ordinary thought and all phenomena in the universe &quot;exist at each moment in a mutually inclusive relationship.&quot; Furthermore, the figure three thousand is &quot;the product of multiplying specific numerical dharma categories: the ten realms of sentient beings, their mutual inclusion, the ten suchnesses and the three realms.&quot; According to Stone, this concept also:represents a totalistic view of interdependent reality: the Buddha and ordinary worldlings, body and mind, cause and effect, subject and object, sentient and non-sentient are mutually encompassed in every moment of thought.Even though reality is a unified whole, the Dharmadhatu (法界), it can be explained in different ways according to Zhiyi (such as the two truths, and the threefold truth, and the ten realms). Two other schemas which Zhiyi employs are the Three Subtle Dharmas (sentient beings, Buddha and mind) and the Ten Suchnesses (which is drawn from the second chapter of the Lotus Sutra) to explain the various realms and how they have the same nature of the threefold truth. 

Since reality is unified in these ways, by contemplating one&#x27;s mind and thought, one can contemplate the whole of reality and thus Buddhahood itself. Zhiyi explains this by commenting on a passage from the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; which states that &quot;if one disports one&#x27;s mind in the dharmadhatu as if in space, then one will know the objective realm of all Buddhas.&quot; According to Zhiyi:
&quot;The dharmadhatu is the middle. Space is emptiness. The mind and Buddhas are conventional existence. The three together are the objective realm of all Buddhas. This means that if one contemplates [the thoughts of] one&#x27;s mind, one can become endowed with all Buddha-dharmas.&quot; Zhiyi also calls the single reality &quot;the inconceivable mind&quot; (不思議心 &quot;pu ssu i hsin&quot;), which contains all three thousand dharmas and the threefold truth.

=== Buddhahood ===

In his &quot;Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra&quot; (法華玄義 &quot;Chin Fa-hua-hsüan-i&quot;) Zhiyi explains Buddhahood by means of three ways of understanding the causes for Buddhahood and three ways of understanding the result of Buddhahood. The three ways of understanding the causes (which are three ways of saying the same thing) are as follows: 

* Each of the ten dharma realms contains the other nine realms.
* Therefore, the nine realms other than Buddhahood are integrated with Buddhahood. All possess the potential for Buddhahood.
* The ten realms are empty of inherent existence, and they are of the nature of the threefold truth.

The three ways of understanding the result, Buddhahood, are as follows: 

* Buddhahood pervades the entire universe, as Swanson says &quot;it is not a separate realm detached from our world of experience, but an integral and fundamental part of it.&quot;
* The Buddha attained Buddhahood incalculable aeons ago as it is said in the Lotus Sutra
* The Buddha manifests in many different forms for the benefit of all sentient beings.
Therefore, according to Zhiyi, the Buddha-realm is deeply integrated with all other aspects of reality. Zhiyi writes: How can there be any dharma distinct from the Buddha? There cannot. All of the hundred realms and thousand suchnesses are the objective realm of the Buddha.Thus, Buddhahood is not detached from the rest of reality, but integrated with it. The difference is that a Buddha knows reality as it really is. As such, the three subtle dharmas (sentient beings, Buddhas and mind) are part interfused with each other and are part of a single whole. Zhiyi quotes the Avatamsaka sutra which states that &quot;the mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings are not distinct.&quot;

=== Buddha-nature ===
Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra&quot; also explains Buddha-nature through three parallel aspects: 

* &quot;Buddha-nature as the conditional causes of Buddhahood -&quot; Swanson explains this ability to practice the Dharma as the &quot;inherent potential and propensity for Buddhahood within all sentient beings which allows them to practice and build up the proper causes and conditions for attaining Buddhahood.&quot;
* &quot;Buddha-nature as the complete cause of Buddhahood -&quot; This is the inherent potential for wisdom in all sentient beings, this is the wisdom that can destroy delusion and reveal the true nature of reality. It is a presence of wisdom which just needs to be uncovered.
*&quot;Buddha-nature as the direct cause of Buddhahood -&quot; This means that all beings are endowed with &quot;the reality of true thusness&quot;, i.e. they all &quot;participate in the true nature of reality.&quot;

=== The Six Degrees of Identity ===
Tiantai&#x27;s explanation of the path of the bodhisattva was set forth in Zhiyi&#x27;s doctrines of the Six Degrees of Identity and the Six Bodhisattva Stages. 

The Six Degrees of Identity provide an important path schema for the Tiantai school. Ziporyn summarizes these six degrees of realization as follows: 

# Identity in principle: &quot;the objective fact that all things are Buddha; that whether they know it or not they are of the nature of enlightenment. Buddhahood at this level is still pure unrealized potentiality, inherent in all things.&quot; 
# Identity in name: &quot;certain beings hear the doctrine, &quot;You are identical to Buddha,&quot; and if they believe it, they are identical in name; they have this cognitive knowledge of the principle that all are Buddhas.&quot;
# Identity in contemplation and practice: &quot;after accepting this doctrine, these beings become Buddhists and practice the Buddhist path and make progress toward manifesting this inherent potential Buddhahood.&quot; 
# Identity of semblance: &quot;further progress into the ranks and levels of Buddhist mythology.&quot; 
# Partial realization: &quot;the highest ranks of bodhisattva practice.&quot; 
# Ultimate identity: &quot;becoming an actual Buddha in practice.&quot;

=== Non-dual Ethics ===
This non-dual Tiantai teaching of the interfusion of all phenomena and experiences also holds that there is a non-duality of good and evil, which also applies to happiness and suffering, Buddha and Mara (the demon of Death). As noted by Ziporyn, the view that &quot;each experience we have includes not only itself but also all other experiences of all other sentient beings at all times&quot; is related to the idea that &quot;Buddhahood inherently includes every form of evil, that these evils can never be destroyed, and that they do not need to be destroyed (“The evil inherent in the Buddha-nature,” “Buddhahood does not cut off evil”).&quot; Ziporyn further explains this seemingly paradoxical doctrine as follows: &quot;our joy also includes sorrow, our sorrow also includes joy; our evil includes good, our good includes evil; our delusion includes enlightenment, our enlightenment includes delusion.&quot;

=== The Subtle Dharma: One Reality, One Vehicle, many Skillful Means ===
The Tiantai school&#x27;s soteriology is based on the doctrine of the &quot;One Vehicle&quot; (Skt. &quot;ekayāna,&quot; traditional Chinese: 一乘; pinyin: &quot;Yīchéng&quot;) found in the &quot;Lotus Sutra.&quot; Tiantai sees all the various Buddhist teachings, scriptures and practices as being part of a single holistic vehicle (&quot;yana&quot;) leading to Buddhahood.

The discrepancies and seeming contradictions are only due to the fact that these various teachings are all &quot;expedient means&quot; (&quot;upāya&quot;) that are taught according to the different needs and capacities of sentient beings. According to Zhiyi, even though there numerous sutras with many varied teachings, the intent of the Buddha is to lead all sentient beings to Buddhahood. Similarly, just as there are different practices, there are different ways to describe the same unified reality (i.e. emptiness and the threefold truth). Thus, Zhiyi states in the &quot;Fa hua hsuan i&quot; &quot;various terms name one ultimate reality. Only one ultimate reality is given many names.&quot; This ultimate reality is &quot;one yet many, many yet one&quot;. It is many because there are diverse phenomena that arise and perish dependent on causes and conditions and it is one because all of this is equally empty. 

Indeed, Zhiyi outlines four types of oneness: the oneness of the teachings (all teachings of the Buddha are non-contradictory and have one intent), the oneness of the practices (all lead to Buddhahood), the oneness of persons (all will attain Buddhahood), and the oneness of reality. According to Zhiyi, any text which is consistent with these concept teaches &quot;the Subtle Dharma&quot; (&quot;miao-fa&quot;). 

Tiantai thought also provides a classificatory schema (&quot;panjiao&quot;) to explain how the different texts and teachings relate to each other. From the Tiantai point of view, the One Vehicle teaching of the Lotus is called a ‘Round Teaching’, which means that it encircles everything, and lacks any sharp edges or divisions. The Tiantai view is that the highest teaching is a holistic and all encompassing teaching which includes all Buddhist views and practices.

=== Classification of teachings ===
An extension of Tiantai&#x27;s doctrine of the One Vehicle is its classification of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings into the &quot;Five Periods and Eight Teachings.&quot; This classification is usually attributed to Zhiyi, but is probably a later development. This classification of teachings was also done by other schools, such as the Fivefold Classification of the Huayan school.

==== Five Periods ====
The Five Periods are five periods in the life of the Buddha in which, according to Tiantai exegetes, he delivered different teachings, aimed at different audiences with a different level of understanding. The Five Periods are: 

# The Avatamsaka Period. For twenty-one days after his awakening, the buddha delivered the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra,&quot; one of the highest sutras, but this was not widely understood.
# The Agama Period. For twelve years, the Buddha preached the Agamas, including the preparatory teachings of the Four Noble Truths and dependent origination.
# The Vaipulya Period. For eight years, the Buddha delivered the Mahāyāna or &quot;Vaipūlya&quot; (expanded) teachings, such as the &quot;Vimalakirti Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Suvarnaprabhasa Sutra&quot; and other Mahāyāna sutras.
# The Prajña Period. For twenty-two years, the Buddha taught the Mahāyāna &quot;Prajñaparamita-sutras&quot;.
# The Lotus and Nirvana Period. In the last eight years, the Buddha preached the doctrine of the One Buddha Vehicle, and delivered the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot; just before his death.

==== Eight Teachings ====
The Eight Teachings are a classification of different types of Buddhist teaching. They consist of the Fourfold Teaching, and the Fourfold Method:

&quot;The Fourfold Teachings&quot; are called teachings because they are &quot;that which discloses the principle and converts beings&quot; according to Zhiyi. They are:

# &quot;Tripitaka Teaching&quot;: the Sutra, Vinaya and Abhidharma, in which the basic teachings are explained. According to David Chappell, the main elements of this teaching is &quot;the thirty seven conditions for enlightenment, austerity, precepts, intellectual analysis of emptiness, the Six Perfections, and meditation&quot; and the main view is the &quot;arising-and-perishing among the ten realms of existence.&quot;
# &quot;Shared Teaching&quot;: the teaching of emptiness, which is shared by Mahayana and Theravāda. This corresponds to the first of the three contemplations and the practices of the ten stages of the bodhisattva that are shared with the Theravāda.
# &quot;Distinctive Teaching&quot;: the teachings of the Bodhisattva path. This corresponds to the second of the three contemplations. It &quot;involves practices summarized by Chih-i into Fifty two Stages of a Bodhisattva&quot; according to Chappell.
# &quot;Complete Teaching&quot; - the complete and perfect teaching, which is beyond words and concepts. It can be found in the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra.&quot; This corresponds to the third of the three contemplations. According to Chappell, &quot;the Complete Teaching moves beyond stages to see the identity and interpenetration of all the various practices, ideas, and values based on Suchness, Buddha-nature, and the Inconceivable Perceptual Process. Nevertheless, it also has its own set of unique practices such as the Five Repentances.&quot;

&quot;The Fourfold Method:&quot;

# &quot;Gradual Teaching&quot;, a method for those with medium or inferior abilities that advances towards Buddhahood step by step
# &quot;Sudden Teaching&quot;, the Distinctive Teachings and the Complete Teaching for those with superior abilities
# &quot;Secret Teaching&quot;, teachings which are transmitted without the recipient being aware of it
# &quot;Variable Teaching&quot;, a method with no fixed teaching, but various teachings for various persons and circumstances
In the &quot;Ssu chiao i&quot;, Zhiyi states that Four Teachings are based on the Three Truths and Three Contemplations: The Four Teachings explained here arise from the threefold contemplations which were discussed above. They (i.e., the Four Teachings), in turn, actualize the threefold contemplations. First, the contemplation for entering emptiness from provisional existence includes two different methods of entering emptiness, analytical and experiential, which are clumsy and skillful (methods of entering emptiness, respectively). Because one can enter emptiness through the analysis of provisional existence, there arises the Tripitaka Teaching. Because one can enter emptiness through experiencing provisional existence (as empty), there arises the Shared Teaching. From within the second (contemplation) for entering provisional existence from emptiness, there arises the Distinct Teaching. From the third correct contemplation of the Middle Way in one mind, there arises the Complete Teaching.

==== The Four Siddhanta ====
Another way that Tiantai thinkers like Zhiyi classify the Buddhist teachings is through the four siddhantas, which are four principles that the Buddha used to teach the Dharma derived from the &quot;Da zhidu lun&quot;. According to David W. Chappell, the four siddhantas are:(1) First of all, the Buddha used ordinary or mundane modes of expression, (2) then he individualized his teaching and adapted it to the capacities of his listeners, (3) he further altered it in order to respond to and diagnose the spiritual defects of his hearers, and (4) finally all his teaching was based on the perfect and highest wisdom. The first three are conditioned and finite, whereas the last is inconceivable and ineffable.According to Chappell, the main idea of the Tiantai understanding of the Buddha&#x27;s method of teaching is the &quot;receptivity-and-response appropriate to a person&#x27;s capacities&quot;, or &quot;communication based on receptivity-and response&quot;. According to Chappell this means that &quot;not only the form of the teaching, but also the quest for enlightenment (bodhicitta) arises during an interaction involving a response to the capacities and needs of a person.&quot;

==Practice==
According to Charles Luk, in China it has been traditionally held that the meditation methods of the Tiantai are the most systematic and comprehensive of all. Tiantai emphasizes meditation as the union of śamatha (止 &quot;zhǐ&quot;, calming or stabilizing meditation) and vipaśyanā (觀 &quot;guān&quot;, clear seeing or insight).

Regarding the functions of śamatha and vipaśyanā in meditation, Zhiyi writes in his work &quot;Concise Śamatha-vipaśyanā&quot;:
William R. LaFleur summarizes Zhiyi&#x27;s understanding of z&quot;hǐ-guān&quot; (Japanese: &quot;shikan&quot;) as follows:These are recognized as two distinct phases or modes that are also united into one process. &quot;Śamatha&quot;, the first aspect of &quot;shikan&quot;, could be rendered as &quot;standstill&quot;, the philosophical/meditational act through which the random and confused perceptions and cognitions of ordinary experience are brought to a stop and remain in a tranquil state. This stoppage makes possible (and is also made possible by) the second aspect of &quot;shikan&quot;. This is &quot;vipaśyanā&quot;, which could be rendered as &quot;contemplation.&quot; This contemplation is directed toward objects of ordinary perception. It does not attempt to locate the &quot;essences&quot; of phenomena. The contemplator, in accord with the fundamental impermanence of all things (himself included), regards them without obstruction, that is, without the sort of discriminating mind that would seek to arrange phenomena into hierarchies of relative importance and select out some–primarily himself or some part of himself–as deserving of exemption from the rule of impartial impermanence.Zhiyi&#x27;s magnum opus, the &quot;Great Samatha-Vipasyana&quot; (&quot;Móhē Zhǐguān&quot;), outlines his meditation system as consisting of 25 preparatory practices, four kinds of samadhi and ten modes of contemplation. Zhiyi saw the four samadhis as the main pillar of Tiantai meditation practice. Zhiyi writes:

Now if you wish to ascend to the stage of wondrous realization, you will not be able to reach it unless you practice. But if you become skilled at stirring and agitating [the raw milk], then the essence of ghee may be obtained. The Lotus Sutra says, &quot;I also see the sons of Buddha cultivating all manner of practices in order to seek the path to Buddhahood.&quot; There are many methods of practice, but we may summarize them under four sorts: (I) constantly sitting, (2) constantly walking, (3) part walking part sitting, and (4) neither walking nor sitting. By referring to them collectively as &quot;samadhis,&quot; we mean [that one thereby] attunes, rectifies, and stabilizes [the mind]. The &quot;Ta-[chih-tu]lun&quot; (&quot;Great [Perfection of Wisdom] Treatise&quot;) says, &quot;Skillfully to fix the mind on one spot and abide there without shifting-that is called samadhi.&quot;&quot; The Dharmadhatu is a &quot;single spot,&quot; and through true discernment you can abide there and never stray from it. These four types of activity constitute the supporting condition [for meditation]. By discerning the mind and resorting to the supporting condition [of the four activities], one attunes and rectifies [the mind]. For this reason we call them samadhis.&quot;

The Tiantai school also places a great emphasis on Mindfulness of Breathing (Skt. &quot;&quot;) in accordance with the principles of śamatha and vipaśyanā. Zhiyi classifies breathing into four main categories: Panting (喘), Unhurried breathing (風), Deep and quiet breathing (氣), and Stillness or rest (息). Zhiyi holds that the first three kinds of breathing are incorrect, while the fourth is correct, and that the breathing should reach stillness and rest.

==Influence==
David Chappell writes that although the Tiantai school, &quot;has the reputation of being...the most comprehensive and diversified school of Chinese Buddhism, it is almost unknown in the West&quot; despite having a &quot;religious framework that seemed suited to adapt to other cultures, to evolve new practices, and to universalize Buddhism&quot;. He attributes this failure of expansion to the school having &quot;narrowed its practice to a small number of rituals&quot; and because it has &quot;neglected the intellectual breadth and subtlety of its founder&quot;.

==Influence of Traditional East Asian medicine==
Zhiyi 智顗 often talked about meditation with the treatment of disease. Particularly drawing of his insights from the Maha Samatha (摩诃止观), the Children’s Samatha (童蒙止观) and the Initial Approach to the Chan Sect (次第禅门). His conception was influenced by Traditional Indian Buddhist Ayurvedic medicine, Taoism and elements of worship from Chinese folk religion forming a Buddhist medical cultural system that was specifically designed for the Chinese culture and was based on the etiology and pathological theory of Traditional Chinese medicines treatment and prevention of disease, pain and suffering.

<doc id="293485" wikidata="Q539008" url="?curid=293485" title="24-cell">
<text>In four-dimensional geometry, the 24-cell is the convex regular 4-polytope (four-dimensional analogue of a Platonic solid) with Schläfli symbol {3,4,3}. It is also called C24, or the icositetrachoron, octaplex (short for &quot;octahedral complex&quot;), icosatetrahedroid, [[Octacube (sculpture)|octacube]], hyper-diamond or polyoctahedron, being constructed of octahedral cells.

The boundary of the 24-cell is composed of 24 octahedral cells with six meeting at each vertex, and three at each edge. Together they have 96 triangular faces, 96 edges, and 24 vertices. The vertex figure is a cube. The 24-cell is self-dual. The 24-cell and the tesseract are the only convex regular 4-polytopes in which the edge length equals the radius.

The 24-cell does not have a regular analogue in three dimensions or any other number of dimensions, either below or above. It is the only one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes which is not the analogue of one of the five Platonic solids. However, it can be seen as the analogue of a pair of irregular solids: the cuboctahedron and its dual the rhombic dodecahedron.

Translated copies of the 24-cell can tesselate four-dimensional space face-to-face, forming the 24-cell honeycomb. As a polytope that can tile by translation, the 24-cell is an example of a parallelotope, the simplest one that is not also a zonotope.

==Geometry==
The 24-cell incorporates the geometries of every convex regular polytope in the first four dimensions, except the 5-cell, those with a 5 in their Schlӓfli symbol, and the regular polygons with 7 or more sides. In other words, the 24-cell contains &quot;all&quot; of the regular polytopes made of triangles and squares that exist in four dimensions except the regular 5-cell, but &quot;none&quot; of the pentagonal polytopes. The geometric relationships among all of these regular polytopes can be observed in a single 24-cell or the 24-cell honeycomb.

The 24-cell is the fourth in the sequence of six convex regular 4-polytopes (in order of size and complexity). It can be deconstructed into 3 overlapping instances of its predecessor the tesseract (8-cell), as the 8-cell can be deconstructed into 2 instances of its predecessor the 16-cell. The reverse procedure to construct each of these from an instance of its predecessor preserves the radius of the predecessor, but generally produces a successor with a smaller edge length.

=== Coordinates ===
The 24-cell has two natural systems of Cartesian coordinates, which reveal distinct structure.

==== Squares ====
The 24-cell is the convex hull of its vertices which can be described as the 24 coordinate permutations of:

formula_1

Those coordinates can be constructed as , rectifying the 16-cell with 8 vertices permutations of (±2,0,0,0). The vertex figure of a 16-cell is the octahedron; thus, cutting the vertices of the 16-cell at the midpoint of its incident edges produces 8 octahedral cells. This process also rectifies the tetrahedral cells of the 16-cell which become 16 octahedra, giving the 24-cell 24 octahedral cells.

In this frame of reference the 24-cell has edges of length and is inscribed in a 3-sphere of radius . Remarkably, the edge length equals the circumradius, as in the hexagon, or the cuboctahedron. Such polytopes are &quot;radially equilateral&quot;.

The 24 vertices form 18 great squares (3 sets of 6 orthogonal central squares), 3 of which intersect at each vertex. By viewing just one square at each vertex, the 24-cell can be seen as the vertices of 3 pairs of completely orthogonal great squares which intersect at no vertices.

==== Hexagons ====
The 24-cell is self-dual, having the same number of vertices (24) as cells and the same number of edges (96) as faces.

If the dual of the above 24-cell of edge length is taken by reciprocating it about its &quot;inscribed&quot; sphere, another 24-cell is found which has edge length and circumradius 1, and its coordinates reveal more structure. In this frame of reference the 24-cell lies vertex-up, and its vertices can be given as follows:

8 vertices obtained by permuting the &quot;integer&quot; coordinates:

formula_2

and 16 vertices with &quot;half-integer&quot; coordinates of the form:

formula_3

all 24 of which lie at distance 1 from the origin.

Viewed as quaternions, these are the unit Hurwitz quaternions.

The 24-cell has unit radius and unit edge length in this coordinate system. We refer to the system as &quot;unit radius coordinates&quot; to distinguish it from others, such as the radius coordinates used above.

The 24 vertices and 96 edges form 16 non-orthogonal great hexagons, four of which intersect at each vertex. By viewing just one hexagon at each vertex, the 24-cell can be seen as the 24 vertices of 4 non-intersecting hexagonal great circles which are Clifford parallel to each other.

The 12 axes and 16 hexagons of the 24-cell constitute a Reye configuration, which in the language of configurations is written as 124163 to indicate that each axis belongs to 4 hexagons, and each hexagon contains 3 axes.

==== Triangles ====
The 24 vertices form 32 equilateral great triangles, of edge length in the unit-radius 24-cell, inscribed in the 16 great hexagons. Each great triangle is a ring linking three completely disjoint great squares.

==== Hypercubic chords ====

The 24 vertices of the 24-cell are distributed at four different chord lengths from each other: , , and . The chords (the 24-cell edges) are the edges of central hexagons, and the chords are the diagonals of central hexagons. The chords are the edges of central squares, and the chords are the diagonals of central squares.

Each vertex is joined to 8 others by an edge of length 1, spanning 60° = of arc. Next nearest are 6 vertices located 90° = away, along an interior chord of length . Another 8 vertices lie 120° = away, along an interior chord of length . The opposite vertex is 180° = away along a diameter of length 2. Finally, as the 24-cell is radially equilateral, its center is 1 edge length away from all vertices.

To visualize how the interior polytopes of the 24-cell fit together (as described below), keep in mind that the four chord lengths (, , , ) are the long diameters of the hypercubes of dimensions 1 through 4: the long diameter of the square is ; the long diameter of the cube is ; and the long diameter of the tesseract is . Moreover, the long diameter of the octahedron is like the square; and the long diameter of the 24-cell itself is like the tesseract.

==== Geodesics ====

The vertex chords of the 24-cell are arranged in geodesic great circle polygons. The geodesic distance between two 24-cell vertices along a path of edges is always 1, 2, or 3, and it is 3 only for opposite vertices.

The edges occur in 16 hexagonal great circles (in planes inclined at 60 degrees to each other), 4 of which cross at each vertex. The 96 distinct edges divide the surface into 96 triangular faces and 24 octahedral cells: a 24-cell. The 16 hexagonal great circles can be divided into 4 sets of 4 non-intersecting Clifford parallel geodesics, such that only one hexagonal great circle in each set passes through each vertex, and the 4 hexagons in each set reach all 24 vertices.
The chords occur in 18 square great circles (3 sets of 6 orthogonal planes), 3 of which cross at each vertex. The 72 distinct chords do not run in the same planes as the hexagonal great circles; they do not follow the 24-cell&#x27;s edges, they pass through its octagonal cell centers. The 72 chords are the 3 orthogonal axes of the 24 octahedral cells, joining vertices which are 2 edges apart. The 18 square great circles can be divided into 3 sets of 6 non-intersecting Clifford parallel geodesics, such that only one square great circle in each set passes through each vertex, and the 6 squares in each set reach all 24 vertices.

The chords occur in 32 triangular great circles in 16 planes, 4 of which cross at each vertex. The 96 distinct chords run vertex-to-every-other-vertex in the same planes as the hexagonal great circles. They are the 3 edges of the 32 great triangles inscribed in the 16 great hexagons, joining vertices which are 2 edges apart on a great circle.

The chords occur as 12 vertex-to-vertex diameters (3 sets of 4 orthogonal axes), the 24 radii around the 25th central vertex.

The sum of the squared lengths of all these distinct chords of the 24-cell is 576 = 242. These are all the central polygons through vertices, but in 4-space there are geodesics on the 3-sphere which do not lie in central planes at all. There are geodesic shortest paths between two 24-cell vertices that are helical rather than simply circular; they correspond to diagonal isoclinic rotations rather than simple rotations.

The edges occur in 48 parallel pairs, apart. The chords occur in 36 parallel pairs, apart. The chords occur in 48 parallel pairs, apart.

The central planes of the 24-cell can be divided into 4 orthogonal central hyperplanes (3-spaces) each forming a cuboctahedron. The great hexagons are 60 degrees apart; the great squares are 90 degrees or 60 degrees apart; a great square and a great hexagon are 90 degrees &quot;and&quot; 60 degrees apart. Each set of similar central polygons (squares or hexagons) can be divided into 4 sets of non-intersecting Clifford parallel polygons (of 6 squares or 4 hexagons). Each set of Clifford parallel great circles is a parallel fiber bundle which visits all 24 vertices just once.

Each great circle intersects with the other great circles to which it is not Clifford parallel at one diameter of the 24-cell. Great circles which are completely orthogonal or otherwise Clifford parallel do not intersect at all: they pass through disjoint sets of vertices.

=== Constructions ===
Triangles and squares come together uniquely in the 24-cell to generate, as interior features, all of the triangle-faced and square-faced regular convex polytopes in the first four dimensions (with caveats for the 5-cell and the 600-cell). Consequently, there are numerous ways to construct or deconstruct the 24-cell.

==== Reciprocal constructions from 8-cell and 16-cell ====
The 8 integer vertices (±1, 0, 0, 0) are the vertices of a regular 16-cell, and the 16 half-integer vertices (±, ±, ±, ±) are the vertices of its dual, the tesseract (8-cell). The tesseract gives Gosset&#x27;s construction of the 24-cell, equivalent to cutting a tesseract into 8 cubic pyramids, and then attaching them to the facets of a second tesseract. The analogous construction in 3-space gives the rhombic dodecahedron which, however, is not regular. The 16-cell gives the reciprocal construction of the 24-cell, Cesaro&#x27;s construction, equivalent to rectifying a 16-cell (truncating its corners at the mid-edges, as described above). The analogous construction in 3-space gives the cuboctahedron (dual of the rhombic dodecahedron) which, however, is not regular. The tesseract and the 16-cell are the only regular 4-polytopes in the 24-cell.

We can further divide the 16 half-integer vertices into two groups: those whose coordinates contain an even number of minus (−) signs and those with an odd number. Each of these groups of 8 vertices also define a regular 16-cell. This shows that the vertices of the 24-cell can be grouped into three disjoint sets of eight with each set defining a regular 16-cell, and with the complement defining the dual tesseract. This also shows that the symmetries of the 16-cell form a subgroup of index 3 of the symmetry group of the 24-cell.

==== Diminishings ====
We can facet the 24-cell by cutting through interior cells bounded by vertex chords to remove vertices, exposing the facets of interior 4-polytopes inscribed in the 24-cell. One can cut a 24-cell through any planar hexagon of 6 vertices, any planar rectangle of 4 vertices, or any triangle of 3 vertices. The great circle central planes (above) are only some of those planes. Here we shall expose some of the others: the face planes of interior polytopes.

===== 8-cell =====
Starting with a complete 24-cell, remove 8 orthogonal vertices (4 opposite pairs on 4 perpendicular axes), and the 8 edges which radiate from each, by cutting through 8 cubic cells bounded by edges to remove 8 cubic pyramids whose apexes are the vertices to be removed. This removes 4 edges from each hexagonal great circle (retaining just one opposite pair of edges), so no continuous hexagonal great circles remain. Now 3 perpendicular edges meet and form the corner of a cube at each of the 16 remaining vertices, and the 32 remaining edges divide the surface into 24 square faces and 8 cubic cells: a tesseract. There are three ways you can do this (choose a set of 8 orthogonal vertices out of 24), so there are three such tesseracts inscribed in the 24-cell. They overlap with each other, but most of their element sets are disjoint: they share some vertex count, but no edge length, face area, or cell volume. They do share 4-content, their common core.

===== 16-cell =====
Starting with a complete 24-cell, remove the 16 vertices of a tesseract (retaining the 8 vertices you removed above), by cutting through 16 tetrahedral cells bounded by chords to remove 16 tetrahedral pyramids whose apexes are the vertices to be removed. This removes 12 great squares (retaining just one orthogonal set) and all the edges, exposing chords as the new edges. Now the remaining 6 great squares cross perpendicularly, 3 at each of 8 remaining vertices, and their 24 edges divide the surface into 32 triangular faces and 16 tetrahedral cells: a 16-cell. There are three ways you can do this (remove 1 of 3 sets of tesseract vertices), so there are three such 16-cells inscribed in the 24-cell. They overlap with each other, but all of their element sets are disjoint: they do not share any vertex count, edge length, or face area, but they do share cell volume. They also share 4-content, their common core.

==== Tetrahedral constructions ====
The 24-cell can be constructed radially from 96 equilateral triangles of edge length which meet at the center of the polytope, each contributing two radii and an edge. They form 96 tetrahedra (each contributing one 24-cell face), all sharing the 25th central apex vertex. These form 24 octahedral pyramids (half-16-cells) with their apexes at the center.

The 24-cell can be constructed from 96 equilateral triangles of edge length , where the three vertices of each triangle are located 90° = away from each other on the 3-sphere. They form 48 -edge tetrahedra (the cells of the three 16-cells), centered at the 24 mid-edge-radii of the 24-cell.

The 24-cell can be constructed directly from its characteristic simplex , the irregular 5-cell which is the fundamental region of its symmetry group F4, by reflection of that 4-orthoscheme in its own cells (which are 3-orthoschemes).

==== Cubic constructions ====
The 24-cell is not only the 24-octahedral-cell, it is also the 24-cubical-cell, although the cubes are cells of the three 8-cells, not cells of the 24-cell, in which they are not volumetrically disjoint.

The 24-cell can be constructed from 24 cubes of its own edge length (three 8-cells). Each of the cubes is shared by 2 8-cells, each of the cubes&#x27; square faces is shared by 4 cubes (in 2 8-cells), each of the 96 edges is shared by 8 square faces (in 4 cubes in 2 8-cells), and each of the 96 vertices is shared by 16 edges (in 8 square faces in 4 cubes in 2 8-cells).

==== Relationships among interior polytopes ====
The 24-cell, three tesseracts, and three 16-cells are deeply entwined around their common center, and intersect in a common core. The tesseracts and the 16-cells are rotated 60° isoclinically with respect to each other. This means that the corresponding vertices of two tesseracts or two 16-cells are (120°) apart.

The tesseracts are inscribed in the 24-cell such that their vertices and edges are exterior elements of the 24-cell, but their square faces and cubical cells lie inside the 24-cell (they are not elements of the 24-cell). The 16-cells are inscribed in the 24-cell such that only their vertices are exterior elements of the 24-cell: their edges, triangular faces, and tetrahedral cells lie inside the 24-cell. The interior 16-cell edges have length .

The 16-cells are also inscribed in the tesseracts: their edges are the face diagonals of the tesseract, and their 8 vertices occupy every other vertex of the tesseract. Each tesseract has two 16-cells inscribed in it (occupying the opposite vertices and face diagonals), so each 16-cell is inscribed in two of the three 8-cells. This is reminiscent of the way, in 3 dimensions, two opposing regular tetrahedra can be inscribed in a cube, as discovered by Kepler. In fact it is the exact dimensional analogy (the demihypercubes), and the 48 tetrahedral cells are inscribed in the 24 cubical cells in just that way.

The 24-cell encloses the three tesseracts within its envelope of octahedral facets, leaving 4-dimensional space in some places between its envelope and each tesseract&#x27;s envelope of cubes. Each tesseract encloses two of the three 16-cells, leaving 4-dimensional space in some places between its envelope and each 16-cell&#x27;s envelope of tetrahedra. Thus there are measurable 4-dimensional interstices between the 24-cell, 8-cell and 16-cell envelopes. The shapes filling these gaps are 4-pyramids, alluded to above.

==== Boundary cells ====
Despite the 4-dimensional interstices between 24-cell, 8-cell and 16-cell envelopes, their 3-dimensional volumes overlap. The different envelopes are separated in some places, and in contact in other places (where no 4-pyramid lies between them). Where they are in contact, they merge and share cell volume: they are the same 3-membrane in those places, not two separate but adjacent 3-dimensional layers. Because there are a total of 7 envelopes, there are places where several envelopes come together and merge volume, and also places where envelopes interpenetrate (cross from inside to outside each other).

Some interior features lie within the 3-space of the (outer) boundary envelope of the 24-cell itself: each octahedral cell is bisected by three perpendicular squares (one from each of the tesseracts), and the diagonals of those squares (which cross each other perpendicularly at the center of the octahedron) are 16-cell edges (one from each 16-cell). Each square bisects an octahedron into two square pyramids, and also bonds two adjacent cubic cells of a tesseract together as their common face.

As we saw above, 16-cell tetrahedral cells are inscribed in tesseract cubic cells, sharing the same volume. 24-cell octahedral cells overlap their volume with cubic cells: they are bisected by a square face into two square pyramids, the apexes of which also lie at a vertex of a cube. The octahedra share volume not only with the cubes, but with the tetrahedra inscribed in them; thus the 24-cell, tesseracts, and 16-cells all share some boundary volume.

=== As a configuration ===
This configuration matrix represents the 24-cell. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, faces, and cells. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole 24-cell. The non-diagonal numbers say how many of the column&#x27;s element occur in or at the row&#x27;s element.

formula_4

Since the 24-cell is self-dual, its matrix is identical to its 180 degree rotation.

==Symmetries, root systems, and tessellations==
The 24 root vectors of the D4 root system of the simple Lie group SO(8) form the vertices of a 24-cell. The vertices can be seen in 3 hyperplanes, with the 6 vertices of an octahedron cell on each of the outer hyperplanes and 12 vertices of a cuboctahedron on a central hyperplane. These vertices, combined with the 8 vertices of the 16-cell, represent the 32 root vectors of the B4 and C4 simple Lie groups.

The 48 vertices (or strictly speaking their radius vectors) of the union of the 24-cell and its dual form the root system of type F4. The 24 vertices of the original 24-cell form a root system of type D4; its size has the ratio :1. This is likewise true for the 24 vertices of its dual. The full symmetry group of the 24-cell is the Weyl group of F4, which is generated by reflections through the hyperplanes orthogonal to the F4 roots. This is a solvable group of order 1152. The rotational symmetry group of the 24-cell is of order 576.

===Quaternionic interpretation===
When interpreted as the quaternions, the F4 root lattice (which is the integral span of the vertices of the 24-cell) is closed under multiplication and is therefore a ring. This is the ring of Hurwitz integral quaternions. The vertices of the 24-cell form the group of units (i.e. the group of invertible elements) in the Hurwitz quaternion ring (this group is also known as the binary tetrahedral group). The vertices of the 24-cell are precisely the 24 Hurwitz quaternions with norm squared 1, and the vertices of the dual 24-cell are those with norm squared 2. The D4 root lattice is the dual of the F4 and is given by the subring of Hurwitz quaternions with even norm squared.

Viewed as the 24 unit Hurwitz quaternions, the unit radius coordinates of the 24-cell represent (in antipodal pairs) the 12 rotations of a regular tetrahedron.

Vertices of other convex regular 4-polytopes also form multiplicative groups of quaternions, but few of them generate a root lattice.

===Voronoi cells===
The Voronoi cells of the D4 root lattice are regular 24-cells. The corresponding Voronoi tessellation gives the tessellation of 4-dimensional Euclidean space by regular 24-cells, the 24-cell honeycomb. The 24-cells are centered at the D4 lattice points (Hurwitz quaternions with even norm squared) while the vertices are at the F4 lattice points with odd norm squared. Each 24-cell of this tessellation has 24 neighbors. With each of these it shares an octahedron. It also has 24 other neighbors with which it shares only a single vertex. Eight 24-cells meet at any given vertex in this tessellation. The Schläfli symbol for this tessellation is {3,4,3,3}. It is one of only three regular tessellations of R4.

The unit balls inscribed in the 24-cells of this tessellation give rise to the densest known lattice packing of hyperspheres in 4 dimensions. The vertex configuration of the 24-cell has also been shown to give the highest possible kissing number in 4 dimensions.

===Radially equilateral honeycomb===
The dual tessellation of the 24-cell honeycomb {3,4,3,3} is the 16-cell honeycomb {3,3,4,3}. The third regular tessellation of four dimensional space is the tesseractic honeycomb {4,3,3,4}, whose vertices can be described by 4-integer Cartesian coordinates. The congruent relationships among these three tessellations can be helpful in visualizing the 24-cell, in particular the radial equilateral symmetry which it shares with the tesseract.

A honeycomb of unit edge length 24-cells may be overlaid on a honeycomb of unit edge length tesseracts such that every vertex of a tesseract (every 4-integer coordinate) is also the vertex of a 24-cell (and tesseract edges are also 24-cell edges), and every center of a 24-cell is also the center of a tesseract. The 24-cells are twice as large as the tesseracts by 4-dimensional content (hypervolume), so overall there are two tesseracts for every 24-cell, only half of which are inscribed in a 24-cell. If those tesseracts are colored black, and their adjacent tesseracts (with which they share a cubical facet) are colored red, a 4-dimensional checkerboard results. Of the 24 center-to-vertex radii of each 24-cell, 16 are also the radii of a black tesseract inscribed in the 24-cell. The other 8 radii extend outside the black tesseract (through the centers of its cubical facets) to the centers of the 8 adjacent red tesseracts. Thus the 24-cell honeycomb and the tesseractic honeycomb coincide in a special way: 8 of the 24 vertices of each 24-cell do not occur at a vertex of a tesseract (they occur at the center of a tesseract instead). Each black tesseract is cut from a 24-cell by truncating it at these 8 vertices, slicing off 8 cubic pyramids (as in reversing Gosset&#x27;s construction, but instead of being removed the pyramids are simply colored red and left in place). Eight 24-cells meet at the center of each red tesseract: each one meets its opposite at that shared vertex, and the six others at a shared octahedral cell. 

The red tesseracts are filled cells (they contain a central vertex and radii); the black tesseracts are empty cells. The vertex set of this union of two honeycombs includes the vertices of all the 24-cells and tesseracts, plus the centers of the red tesseracts. Adding the 24-cell centers (which are also the black tesseract centers) to this honeycomb yields a 16-cell honeycomb, the vertex set of which includes all the vertices and centers of all the 24-cells and tesseracts. The formerly empty centers of adjacent 24-cells become the opposite vertices of a unit edge length 16-cell. 24 half-16-cells (octahedral pyramids) meet at each formerly empty center to fill each 24-cell, and their octahedral bases are the 6-vertex octahedral facets of the 24-cell (shared with an adjacent 24-cell).

Notice the complete absence of pentagons anywhere in this union of three honeycombs. Like the 24-cell, 4-dimensional Euclidean space itself is entirely filled by a complex of all the polytopes that can be built out of regular triangles and squares (except the 5-cell), but that complex does not require (or permit) any of the pentagonal polytopes.

== Rotations ==

The regular convex 4-polytopes are an expression of their underlying symmetry which is known as SO(4), the group of rotations about a fixed point in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.

=== The 3 Cartesian bases of the 24-cell ===
There are three distinct orientations of the tesseractic honeycomb which could be made to coincide with the 24-cell honeycomb, depending on which of the 24-cell&#x27;s three disjoint sets of 8 orthogonal vertices (which set of 4 perpendicular axes, or equivalently, which inscribed basis 16-cell) was chosen to align it, just as three tesseracts can be inscribed in the 24-cell, rotated with respect to each other. The distance from one of these orientations to another is an isoclinic rotation through 60 degrees (a double rotation of 60 degrees in each pair of orthogonal invariant planes, around a single fixed point). This rotation can be seen most clearly in the hexagonal central planes, where every hexagon rotates to change which of its three diameters is aligned with a coordinate system axis.

=== Planes of rotation ===
Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space can be seen as the composition of two 2-dimensional rotations in completely orthogonal planes. Thus the general rotation in 4-space is a &quot;double rotation&quot;. There are two important special cases, called a &quot;simple rotation&quot; and an &quot;isoclinic rotation&quot;.

==== Simple rotations ====
In 3 dimensions a spinning polyhedron has a single invariant central &quot;plane of rotation&quot;. The plane is an invariant set because each point in the plane moves in a circle but stays within the plane. Only &quot;one&quot; of a polyhedron&#x27;s central planes can be invariant during a particular rotation; the choice of invariant central plane, and the angular distance and direction it is rotated, completely specifies the rotation. Points outside the invariant plane also move in circles (unless they are on the fixed &quot;axis of rotation&quot; perpendicular to the invariant plane), but the circles do not lie within a &quot;central&quot; plane.

When a 4-polytope is rotating with only one invariant central plane, the same kind of simple rotation is happening that occurs in 3 dimensions. One difference is that instead of a fixed axis of rotation, there is an entire fixed central plane in which the points do not move. The fixed plane is the one central plane that is completely orthogonal to the invariant plane of rotation. In the 24-cell, there is a simple rotation which will take any vertex &quot;directly&quot; to any other vertex, also moving most of the other vertices but leaving at least 2 and at most 6 other vertices fixed (the vertices that the fixed central plane intersects). The vertex moves along a great circle in the invariant plane of rotation between adjacent vertices of a great hexagon, a great square or a great digon, and the completely orthogonal fixed plane is a digon, a square or a hexagon, respectively. 

==== Double rotations ====
The points in the completely orthogonal central plane are not &quot;constrained&quot; to be fixed. It is also possible for them to be rotating in circles, as a second invariant plane, at a rate independent of the first invariant plane&#x27;s rotation: a double rotation in two perpendicular non-intersecting planes of rotation at once. In a double rotation there is no fixed plane or axis: every point moves except the center point. The angular distance rotated may be different in the two completely orthogonal central planes, but they are always both invariant: their circularly moving points remain within the plane &quot;as the whole plane tilts sideways&quot; in the completely orthogonal rotation. A rotation in 4-space always has (at least) &quot;two&quot; completely orthogonal invariant planes of rotation, although in a simple rotation the angle of rotation in one of them is 0.

Double rotations come in two chiral forms: &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; rotations. In a double rotation each vertex moves in a spiral along two orthogonal great circles at once. Either the path is right-hand threaded (like most screws and bolts), moving along the circles in the &quot;same&quot; directions, or it is left-hand threaded (like a reverse-threaded bolt), moving along the circles in what we conventionally say are &quot;opposite&quot; directions (according to the right hand rule by which we conventionally say which way is &quot;up&quot; on each of the 4 coordinate axes).

In double rotations of the 24-cell that take vertices to vertices, one invariant plane of rotation contains either a great hexagon, a great square, or only an axis (two vertices, a great digon). The completely orthogonal invariant plane of rotation will necessarily contain a great digon, a great square, or a great hexagon, respectively. The selection of an invariant plane of rotation, a rotational direction and angle through which to rotate it, and a rotational direction and angle through which to rotate its completely orthogonal plane, completely determines the nature of the rotational displacement. In the 24-cell there are several noteworthy kinds of double rotation permitted by these parameters.

==== Isoclinic rotations ====
When the angles of rotation in the two completely orthogonal invariant planes are exactly the same, a remarkably symmetric transformation occurs: all the great circle planes Clifford parallel to the pair of invariant planes become pairs of invariant planes of rotation themselves, through that same angle, and the 4-polytope rotates isoclinically in many directions at once. Each vertex moves an equal distance in four orthogonal directions at the same time. In the 24-cell any isoclinic rotation through 60 degrees in a hexagonal plane takes each vertex to a vertex two edge lengths away, rotates &quot;all 16&quot; hexagons by 60 degrees, and takes &quot;every&quot; great circle polygon (square, hexagon or triangle) to a Clifford parallel great circle polygon of the same kind 120 degrees away. An isoclinic rotation is also called a &quot;Clifford displacement&quot;, after its discoverer.

The 24-cell in the &quot;double&quot; rotation animation appears to turn itself inside out. It appears to, because it actually does, reversing the chirality of the whole 4-polytope just the way your bathroom mirror reverses the chirality of your image by a 180 degree reflection. Each 360 degree isoclinic rotation is as if the 24-cell surface had been stripped off like a glove and turned inside out, making a right-hand glove into a left-hand glove (or vice versa).

In a simple rotation of the 24-cell in a hexagonal plane, each vertex in the plane rotates first along an edge to an adjacent vertex 60 degrees away. But in an isoclinic rotation in &quot;two&quot; completely orthogonal planes one of which is a great hexagon, each vertex rotates first to a vertex &quot;two&quot; edge lengths away ( and 120° distant). The double 60-degree rotation&#x27;s helical geodesics pass through every other vertex, missing the vertices in between. Each chord of the helical geodesic crosses between two Clifford parallel hexagon central planes, and lies in another hexagon central plane that intersects them both. The chords meet at a 60° angle, but since they lie in different planes they form a helix not a triangle. Three chords and 360° of rotation takes the vertex to an adjacent vertex, not back to itself. The helix of chords closes into a loop only after six chords: a 720° rotation twice around the 24-cell on a skew hexagram with edges. Even though all 24 vertices and all the hexagons rotate at once, a 360 degree isoclinic rotation moves each vertex only halfway around its circuit. After 360 degrees each helix has departed from 3 vertices and reached a fourth vertex adjacent to the original vertex, but has &quot;not&quot; arrived back exactly at the vertex it departed from. Each central plane (every hexagon or square in the 24-cell) has rotated 360 degrees &quot;and&quot; been tilted sideways all the way around 360 degrees back to its original position (like a coin flipping twice), but the 24-cell&#x27;s orientation in the 4-space in which it is embedded is now different. Because the 24-cell is now inside-out, if the isoclinic rotation is continued in the &quot;same&quot; direction through another 360 degrees, the 24 moving vertices will pass through the other half of the vertices that were missed on the first revolution (the 12 antipodal vertices of the 12 that were hit the first time around), and each isoclinic geodesic &quot;will&quot; arrive back at the vertex it departed from, forming a closed six-chord helical loop. It takes a 720 degree isoclinic rotation for each hexagram2 geodesic to complete a circuit through every &quot;second&quot; vertex of its six vertices by winding around the 24-cell twice, returning the 24-cell to its original chiral orientation.

The hexagonal winding path that each vertex takes as it loops twice around the 24-cell forms a double helix bent into a Möbius ring, so that the two strands of the double helix form a continuous single strand in a closed loop. In the first revolution the vertex traverses one 3-chord strand of the double helix; in the second revolution it traverses the second 3-chord strand, moving in the same rotational direction with the same handedness (bending either left or right) throughout. Although this isoclinic Möbius ring is a circular spiral through all 4 dimensions, not a 2-dimensional circle, like a great circle it is a geodesic because it is the shortest path from vertex to vertex.

=== Clifford parallel polytopes ===
Two planes are also called &quot;isoclinic&quot; if an isoclinic rotation will bring them together. The isoclinic planes are precisely those central planes with Clifford parallel geodesic great circles. Clifford parallel great circles do not intersect, so isoclinic great circle polygons have disjoint vertices. In the 24-cell every hexagonal central plane is isoclinic to three others, and every square central plane is isoclinic to five others. We can pick out 4 mutually isoclinic (Clifford parallel) great hexagons (four different ways) covering all 24 vertices of the 24-cell just once (a hexagonal fibration). We can pick out 6 mutually isoclinic (Clifford parallel) great squares (three different ways) covering all 24 vertices of the 24-cell just once (a square fibration). Every isoclinic rotation taking vertices to vertices corresponds to a discrete fibration.

Two dimensional great circle polygons are not the only polytopes in the 24-cell which are parallel in the Clifford sense. Congruent polytopes of 2, 3 or 4 dimensions can be said to be Clifford parallel in 4 dimensions if their corresponding vertices are all the same distance apart. The three 16-cells inscribed in the 24-cell are Clifford parallels. Clifford parallel polytopes are &quot;completely disjoint&quot; polytopes. A 60 degree isoclinic rotation in hexagonal planes takes each 16-cell to a disjoint 16-cell. Like all double rotations, isoclinic rotations come in two chiral forms: there is a disjoint 16-cell to the &quot;left&quot; of each 16-cell, and another to its &quot;right&quot;.

All Clifford parallel 4-polytopes are related by an isoclinic rotation, but not all isoclinic polytopes are Clifford parallels (completely disjoint). The three 8-cells in the 24-cell are isoclinic but not Clifford parallel. Like the 16-cells, they are rotated 60 degrees isoclinically with respect to each other, but their vertices are not all disjoint (and therefore not all equidistant). Each vertex occurs in two of the three 8-cells (as each 16-cell occurs in two of the three 8-cells).

Isoclinic rotations relate the convex regular 4-polytopes to each other. An isoclinic rotation of a single 16-cell will generate a 24-cell. A simple rotation of a single 16-cell will not, because its vertices will not reach either of the other two 16-cells&#x27; vertices in the course of the rotation. An isoclinic rotation of the 24-cell will generate the 600-cell, and an isoclinic rotation of the 600-cell will generate the 120-cell. (Or they can all be generated directly by an isoclinic rotation of the 16-cell, generating isoclinic copies of itself.) The different convex regular 4-polytopes nest inside each other, and multiple instances of the same 4-polytope hide next to each other in the Clifford parallel spaces that comprise the 3-sphere. For an object of more than one dimension, the only way to reach these parallel subspaces directly is by isoclinic rotation.

=== Rings ===
In the 24-cell there are sets of rings of six different kinds, described separately in detail in other sections of this article. This section describes how the different kinds of rings are intertwined.

The 24-cell contains four kinds of geodesic fibers (polygonal rings running through vertices): great circle squares and their isoclinic helix octagrams, and great circle hexagons and their isoclinic helix hexagrams. It also contains two kinds of cell rings (chains of octahedra bent into a ring in the fourth dimension): four octahedra connected vertex-to-vertex and bent into a square, and six octahedra connected face-to-face and bent into a hexagon.

==== 4-cell rings ====
Four unit-edge-length octahedra can be connected vertex-to-vertex along a common axis of length 4. The axis can then be bent into a square of edge length . Although it is possible to do this in a space of only three dimensions, that is not how it occurs in the 24-cell. Although the axes of the four octahedra occupy the same plane, forming one of the 18 great squares of the 24-cell, each octahedron occupies a different 3-dimensional hyperplane, and all four dimensions are utilized. The 24-cell can be partitioned into 6 such 4-cell rings (three different ways), mutually interlinked like adjacent links in a chain (but these links all have a common center). An isoclinic rotation in the great square plane by a multiple of 90° takes each octahedron in the ring to an octahedron in the ring.

==== 6-cell rings ====
Six regular octahedra can be connected face-to-face along a common axis that passes through their centers of volume, forming a stack or column with only triangular faces. In a space of four dimensions, the axis can then be bent 60° in the fourth dimension at each of the six octahedron centers, in a plane orthogonal to all three orthogonal central planes of each octahedron, such that the top and bottom triangular faces of the column become coincident. The column becomes a ring around a hexagonal axis. The 24-cell can be partitioned into 4 such rings (four different ways), mutually interlinked. Because the hexagonal axis joins cell centers (not vertices), it is not a great hexagon of the 24-cell. However, six great hexagons can be found in the ring of six octahedra, running along the edges of the octahedra. In the column of six octahedra (before it is bent into a ring) there are six spiral paths along edges running up the column: three parallel helices spiraling clockwise, and three parallel helices spiraling counterclockwise. Each clockwise helix intersects each counterclockwise helix at two vertices three edge lengths apart. Bending the column into a ring changes these helices into great circle hexagons. The ring has two sets of three great hexagons, each on three Clifford parallel great circles. The great hexagons in each parallel set of three do not intersect, but each intersects the other three great hexagons (to which it is not Clifford parallel) at two antipodal vertices.

A simple rotation in any of the great hexagon planes by a multiple of 60° rotates only that hexagon invariantly, taking each vertex in that hexagon to a vertex in the same hexagon. An isoclinic rotation by 60° in any of the six great hexagon planes rotates all three Clifford parallel great hexagons invariantly, and takes each octahedron in the ring to a &quot;non-adjacent&quot; octahedron in the ring.

Each isoclinically displaced octahedron is also rotated itself. After a 360° isoclinic rotation each octahedron is back in the same position, but in a different orientation. In a 720° isoclinic rotation, its vertices are returned to their original orientation.

Four Clifford parallel great hexagons comprise a discrete fiber bundle covering all 24 vertices in a Hopf fibration. The 24-cell has four such discrete hexagonal fibrations formula_5. Each great hexagon belongs to just one fibration, and the four fibrations are defined by disjoint sets of four great hexagons each. Each fibration is the domain (container) of a unique left-right pair of isoclinic rotations (left and right Hopf fiber bundles).

Four cell-disjoint 6-cell rings also comprise each discrete fibration defined by four Clifford parallel great hexagons. Each 6-cell ring contains only 18 of the 24 vertices, and only 6 of the 16 great hexagons, which we see illustrated above running along the cell ring&#x27;s edges: 3 spiraling clockwise and 3 counterclockwise. Those 6 hexagons running along the cell ring&#x27;s edges are not among the set of four parallel hexagons which define the fibration. For example, one of the four 6-cell rings in fibration formula_6 contains 3 parallel hexagons running clockwise along the cell ring&#x27;s edges from fibration formula_7, and 3 parallel hexagons running counterclockwise along the cell ring&#x27;s edges from fibration formula_8, but that cell ring contains no great hexagons from fibration formula_6 or fibration formula_10.

The 24-cell contains 16 great hexagons, divided into four disjoint sets of four hexagons, each disjoint set uniquely defining a fibration. Each fibration is also a distinct set of four cell-disjoint 6-cell rings. The 24-cell has exactly 16 distinct 6-cell rings. Each 6-cell ring belongs to just one of the four fibrations.

==== Helical hexagrams and their isoclines ====
Another kind of geodesic fiber, the helical hexagram isoclines, can be found within a 6-cell ring of octahedra. Each of these geodesics runs through every &quot;second&quot; vertex of a skew hexagram2, which in the unit-radius, unit-edge-length 24-cell has six edges. The hexagram does not lie in a single central plane, but is composed of six linked chords from the six different hexagon great circles in the 6-cell ring. The isocline geodesic fiber is the path of an isoclinic rotation, a helical rather than simply circular path around the 24-cell which links vertices two edge lengths apart and consequently must wrap twice around the 24-cell before completing its six-vertex loop. Rather than a flat hexagon, it forms a skew hexagram out of two three-sided 360 degree half-loops: open triangles joined end-to-end to each other in a six-sided Möbius loop.

Each 6-cell ring contains six such hexagram isoclines, three black and three white, that connect even and odd vertices respectively. Each of the three black-white pairs of isoclines belongs to one of the three fibrations in which the 6-cell ring occurs. Each fibration&#x27;s right (or left) rotation traverses two black isoclines and two white isoclines in parallel, rotating all 24 vertices.

Beginning at any vertex at one end of the column of six octahedra, we can follow an isoclinic path of chords of an isocline from octahedron to octahedron. In the 24-cell the edges are great hexagon edges (and octahedron edges); in the column of six octahedra we see six great hexagons running along the octahedra&#x27;s edges. The chords are great hexagon diagonals, joining great hexagon vertices two edges apart. We find them in the ring of six octahedra running from a vertex in one octahedron to a vertex in the next octahedron, passing through the face shared by the two octahedra (but not touching any of the face&#x27;s 3 vertices). Each chord is a chord of just one great hexagon (an edge of a great triangle inscribed in that great hexagon), but successive chords belong to different great hexagons. At each vertex the isoclinic path of chords bends 60 degrees in two central planes at once: 60 degrees around the great hexagon that the chord before the vertex belongs to, and 60 degrees into the plane of a different great hexagon entirely, that the chord after the vertex belongs to. Thus the path follows one great hexagon from each octahedron to the next, but switches to another of the six great hexagons in the next link of the hexagram2 path. Followed along the column of six octahedra (and &quot;around the end&quot; where the column is bent into a ring) the path may at first appear to be zig-zagging between three adjacent parallel hexagonal central planes (like a Petrie polygon), but it is not: any isoclinic path we can pick out always zig-zags between &quot;two sets&quot; of three adjacent parallel hexagonal central planes, intersecting only every even (or odd) vertex and never changing its inherent even/odd parity, as it visits all six of the great hexagons in the 6-cell ring in rotation. When it has traversed one chord from each of the six great hexagons, after 720 degrees of isoclinic rotation (either left or right), it closes its skew hexagram and begins to repeat itself, circling again through the black (or white) vertices and cells.

At each vertex, there are four great hexagons and four hexagram isoclines (all black or all white) that cross at the vertex. Four hexagram isoclines (two black and two white) comprise a unique (left or right) fiber bundle of isoclines covering all 24 vertices in each distinct (left or right) isoclinic rotation. Each fibration has a unique left and right isoclinic rotation, and corresponding unique left and right fiber bundles of isoclines. There are 16 distinct hexagram isoclines in the 24-cell (8 black and 8 white). Each isocline is a skew &quot;Clifford polygon&quot; of no inherent chirality, but acts as a left (or right) isocline when traversed by a left (or right) rotation in different fibrations.

==== Helical octagrams and their isoclines ====
The 24-cell contains 18 helical octagram isoclines (9 black and 9 white). Three pairs of octagram edge-helices are found in each of the three inscribed 16-cells, described elsewhere as the helical construction of the 16-cell. In summary, each 16-cell can be decomposed (three different ways) into a left-right pair of 8-cell rings of -edged tetrahedral cells. Each 8-cell ring twists either left or right around an axial octagram helix of eight chords. In each 16-cell there are exactly 6 distinct helices, identical octagrams which each circle through all eight vertices. Each acts as either a left helix or a right helix or a Petrie polygon in each of the six distinct isoclinic rotations (three left and three right), and has no inherent chirality except in respect to a particular rotation. Adjacent vertices on the octagram isoclines are = 90° apart, so the circumference of the isocline is 4𝝅. An &quot;isoclinic&quot; rotation by 90° in great square invariant planes takes each vertex to its antipodal vertex, four vertices away in either direction along the isocline, and = 180° distant across the diameter of the isocline.

Each of the 3 fibrations of the 24-cell&#x27;s 18 great squares corresponds to a distinct left (and right) isoclinic rotation in great square invariant planes. Each 60° step of the rotation takes 6 disjoint great squares (2 from each 16-cell) to great squares in a neighboring 16-cell, on 8-chord helical isoclines characteristic of the 16-cell.

In the 24-cell, these 18 helical octagram isoclines can be found within the six orthogonal 4-cell rings of octahedra. Each 4-cell ring has cells bonded vertex-to-vertex around a great square axis, and we find antipodal vertices at opposite vertices of the great square. A chord (the diameter of the great square and of the isocline) connects them. Boundary cells describes how the axes of the 24-cell&#x27;s octahedral cells are the edges of the 16-cell&#x27;s tetrahedral cells, each tetrahedron is inscribed in a (tesseract) cube, and each octahedron is inscribed in a pair of cubes (from different tesseracts), bridging them. The vertex-bonded octahedra of the 4-cell ring also lie in different tesseracts. The isocline&#x27;s four diameter chords form an octagram8{4}=4{2} with edges that each run from the vertex of one cube and octahedron and tetrahedron, to the vertex of another cube and octahedron and tetrahedron (in a different tesseract), straight through the center of the 24-cell on one of the 12 axes.

The octahedra in the 4-cell rings are vertex-bonded to more than two other octahedra, because three 4-cell rings (and their three axial great squares, which belong to different 16-cells) cross at 90° at each bonding vertex. At that vertex the octagram makes two right-angled turns at once: 90° around the great square, and 90° orthogonally into a different 4-cell ring entirely. The 180° four-edge arc joining two ends of each diameter chord of the octagram runs through the volumes and opposite vertices of two face-bonded tetrahedra (in the same 16-cell), which are also the opposite vertices of two vertex-bonded octahedra in different 4-cell rings (and different tesseracts). The 720° octagram isocline runs through 8 vertices of the four-cell ring and through the volumes of 16 tetrahedra. At each vertex, there are three great squares and six octagram isoclines (three black-white pairs) that cross at the vertex.

This is the characteristic rotation of the 16-cell, &quot;not&quot; the 24-cell&#x27;s characteristic rotation, and it does not take whole 16-cells &quot;of the 24-cell&quot; to each other the way the 24-cell&#x27;s rotation in great hexagon planes does.

===Characteristic orthoscheme===

Every regular 4-polytope has its characteristic 4-orthoscheme, an irregular 5-cell. The characteristic 5-cell of the regular 24-cell is represented by the Coxeter-Dynkin diagram , which can be read as a list of the dihedral angles between its mirror facets. It is an irregular tetrahedral pyramid based on the characteristic tetrahedron of the regular octahedron. The regular 24-cell is subdivided by its symmetry hyperplanes into 1152 instances of its characteristic 5-cell that all meet at its center.

The characteristic 5-cell (4-orthoscheme) has four more edges than its base characteristic tetrahedron (3-orthoscheme), joining the four vertices of the base to its apex (the fifth vertex of the 4-orthoscheme, at the center of the regular 24-cell). If the regular 24-cell has radius and edge length 𝒍 = 1, its characteristic 5-cell&#x27;s ten edges have lengths , , around its exterior right-triangle face (the edges opposite the &quot;characteristic angles&quot; 𝟀, 𝝉, 𝟁), plus , , (the other three edges of the exterior 3-orthoscheme facet the characteristic tetrahedron, which are the &quot;characteristic radii&quot; of the octahedron), plus , , , (edges which are the characteristic radii of the 24-cell). The 4-edge path along orthogonal edges of the orthoscheme is , , , , first from a 24-cell vertex to a 24-cell edge center, then turning 90° to a 24-cell face center, then turning 90° to a 24-cell octahedral cell center, then turning 90° to the 24-cell center.

=== Reflections ===
The 24-cell can be constructed by the reflections of its characteristic 5-cell in its own facets (its tetrahedral mirror walls). Reflections and rotations are related: a reflection in an &quot;even&quot; number of &quot;intersecting&quot; mirrors is a rotation. Consequently, regular polytopes can be generated by reflections or by rotations. For example, any 720° isoclinic rotation of the 24-cell in a hexagonal invariant plane takes &quot;each&quot; of the 24 vertices to and through 5 other vertices and back to itself, on a skew hexagram2 geodesic isocline that winds twice around the 3-sphere on every &quot;second&quot; vertex of the hexagram. Any set of four orthogonal pairs of antipodal vertices (the 8 vertices of one of the three inscribed 16-cells) performing &quot;half&quot; such an orbit visits 3 * 8 = 24 distinct vertices and generates the 24-cell sequentially in 3 steps of a single 360° isoclinic rotation, just as any single characteristic 5-cell reflecting itself in its own mirror walls generates the 24 vertices simultaneously by reflection.

Tracing the orbit of &quot;one&quot; such 16-cell vertex during the 360° isoclinic rotation reveals more about the relationship between reflections and rotations as generative operations. The vertex follows an isocline (a doubly curved geodesic circle) rather than an ordinary great circle. The isocline connects vertices two edge lengths apart, but curves away from the great circle path over the two edges connecting those vertices, missing the vertex in between. Although the isocline does not follow any one great circle, it is contained within a ring of another kind: in the 24-cell it stays within a 6-cell ring of spherical octahedral cells, intersecting one vertex in each cell, and passing through the volume of two adjacent cells near the missed vertex.

=== Chiral symmetry operations ===

A symmetry operation is a rotation or reflection which leaves the object indistinguishable from itself before the transformation. The 24-cell has 1152 distinct symmetry operations (576 rotations and 576 reflections). Each rotation is equivalent to two reflections, in a distinct pair of non-parallel mirror planes.

Pictured are sets of disjoint great circle polygons, each in a distinct central plane of the 24-cell. For example, {24/4}=4{6} is an orthogonal projection of the 24-cell picturing 4 of its [16] great hexagon planes. The 4 planes lie Clifford parallel to the projection plane and to each other, and their great polygons collectively constitute a discrete Hopf fibration of 4 non-intersecting great circles which visit all 24 vertices just once.

Each row of the table describes a class of distinct rotations. Each rotation class takes the left planes pictured to the corresponding right planes pictured. The vertices of the moving planes move in parallel along the polygonal isocline paths pictured. For example, the formula_11 rotation class consists of [32] distinct rotational displacements by an arc-distance of = 120° between 16 great hexagon planes represented by quaternion group formula_12 and a corresponding set of 16 great hexagon planes represented by quaternion group formula_13. One of the [32] distinct rotations of this class moves the representative vertex coordinate formula_14 to the vertex coordinate formula_15.

In a rotation class formula_16 each quaternion group formula_17 may be representative not only of its own fibration of Clifford parallel planes but also of the other congruent fibrations. For example, rotation class formula_18 takes the 4 hexagon planes of formula_12 to the 4 hexagon planes of formula_13 which are 120° away, in an isoclinic rotation. But in a rigid rotation of this kind, all [16] hexagon planes move in congruent rotational displacements, so this rotation class also includes formula_21, formula_22 and formula_23. The name formula_24 is the conventional representation for all [16] congruent plane displacements.

These rotation classes are all subclasses of formula_11 which has [32] distinct rotational displacements rather than [16] because there are two chiral ways to perform any class of rotations, designated its &quot;left rotations&quot; and its &quot;right rotations&quot;. The [16] left displacements of this class are not congruent with the [16] right displacements, but enantiomorphous like a pair of shoes. Each left (or right) isoclinic rotation takes [16] left planes to [16] right planes, but the left and right planes correspond differently in the left and right rotations. The left and right rotational displacements of the same left plane take it to different right planes.

Each rotation class (table row) describes a distinct left (and right) isoclinic rotation. The left (or right) rotations carry the left planes to the right planes simultaneously, through a characteristic rotation angle. For example, the formula_11 rotation moves all [16] hexagonal planes at once by = 120° each. Repeated 6 times, this left (or right) isoclinic rotation moves each plane 720° and back to itself in the same orientation, passing through all 4 planes of the formula_12 left set and all 4 planes of the formula_13 right set once each. The picture in the isocline column represents this union of the left and right plane sets. In the formula_11 example it can be seen as a set of 4 Clifford parallel skew hexagrams, each having one edge in each great hexagon plane, and skewing to the left (or right) at each vertex throughout the left (or right) isoclinic rotation.

== Visualization ==
=== Cell rings ===
The 24-cell is bounded by 24 octahedral cells. For visualization purposes, it is convenient that the octahedron has opposing parallel faces (a trait it shares with the cells of the tesseract and the 120-cell). One can stack octahedrons face to face in a straight line bent in the 4th direction into a great circle with a circumference of 6 cells. The cell locations lend themselves to a hyperspherical description. Pick an arbitrary cell and label it the &quot;North Pole&quot;. Eight great circle meridians (two cells long) radiate out in 3 dimensions, converging at the 3rd &quot;South Pole&quot; cell. This skeleton accounts for 18 of the 24 cells (2 + ). See the table below.

There is another related great circle in the 24-cell, the dual of the one above. A path that traverses 6 vertices solely along edges resides in the dual of this polytope, which is itself since it is self dual. These are the hexagonal geodesics described above. One can easily follow this path in a rendering of the equatorial cuboctahedron cross-section.

Starting at the North Pole, we can build up the 24-cell in 5 latitudinal layers. With the exception of the poles, each layer represents a separate 2-sphere, with the equator being a great 2-sphere. The cells labeled equatorial in the following table are interstitial to the meridian great circle cells. The interstitial &quot;equatorial&quot; cells touch the meridian cells at their faces. They touch each other, and the pole cells at their vertices. This latter subset of eight non-meridian and pole cells has the same relative position to each other as the cells in a tesseract (8-cell), although they touch at their vertices instead of their faces.

The 24-cell can be partitioned into cell-disjoint sets of four of these 6-cell great circle rings, forming a discrete Hopf fibration of four non-intersecting linked rings. One ring is &quot;vertical&quot;, encompassing the pole cells and four meridian cells. The other three rings each encompass two equatorial cells and four meridian cells, two from the northern hemisphere and two from the southern.

Note this hexagon great circle path implies the interior/dihedral angle between adjacent cells is 180 - 360/6 = 120 degrees. This suggests you can adjacently stack exactly three 24-cells in a plane and form a 4-D honeycomb of 24-cells as described previously.

One can also follow a great circle route, through the octahedrons&#x27; opposing vertices, that is four cells long. These are the square geodesics along four chords described above. This path corresponds to traversing diagonally through the squares in the cuboctahedron cross-section. The 24-cell is the only regular polytope in more than two dimensions where you can traverse a great circle purely through opposing vertices (and the interior) of each cell. This great circle is self dual. This path was touched on above regarding the set of 8 non-meridian (equatorial) and pole cells.

The 24-cell can be equipartitioned into three 8-cell subsets, each having the organization of a tesseract. Each of these subsets can be further equipartitioned into two non-intersecting linked great circle chains, four cells long. Collectively these three subsets now produce another, six ring, discrete Hopf fibration.

=== Parallel projections ===

The &quot;vertex-first&quot; parallel projection of the 24-cell into 3-dimensional space has a rhombic dodecahedral envelope. Twelve of the 24 octahedral cells project in pairs onto six square dipyramids that meet at the center of the rhombic dodecahedron. The remaining 12 octahedral cells project onto the 12 rhombic faces of the rhombic dodecahedron.

The &quot;cell-first&quot; parallel projection of the 24-cell into 3-dimensional space has a cuboctahedral envelope. Two of the octahedral cells, the nearest and farther from the viewer along the &quot;w&quot;-axis, project onto an octahedron whose vertices lie at the center of the cuboctahedron&#x27;s square faces. Surrounding this central octahedron lie the projections of 16 other cells, having 8 pairs that each project to one of the 8 volumes lying between a triangular face of the central octahedron and the closest triangular face of the cuboctahedron. The remaining 6 cells project onto the square faces of the cuboctahedron. This corresponds with the decomposition of the cuboctahedron into a regular octahedron and 8 irregular but equal octahedra, each of which is in the shape of the convex hull of a cube with two opposite vertices removed.

The &quot;edge-first&quot; parallel projection has an elongated hexagonal dipyramidal envelope, and the &quot;face-first&quot; parallel projection has a nonuniform hexagonal bi-antiprismic envelope.

=== Perspective projections ===
The &quot;vertex-first&quot; perspective projection of the 24-cell into 3-dimensional space has a tetrakis hexahedral envelope. The layout of cells in this image is similar to the image under parallel projection.

The following sequence of images shows the structure of the cell-first perspective projection of the 24-cell into 3 dimensions. The 4D viewpoint is placed at a distance of five times the vertex-center radius of the 24-cell.

== Related polytopes ==
=== Three Coxeter group constructions ===
There are two lower symmetry forms of the 24-cell, derived as a &quot;rectified 16-cell&quot;, with B4 or [3,3,4] symmetry drawn bicolored with 8 and 16 octahedral cells. Lastly it can be constructed from D4 or [31,1,1] symmetry, and drawn tricolored with 8 octahedra each.

=== Related complex polygons ===
The regular complex polygon 4{3}4, or contains the 24 vertices of the 24-cell, and 24 4-edges that correspond to central squares of 24 of 48 octahedral cells. Its symmetry is 4[3]4, order 96.

The regular complex polytope 3{4}3, or , in formula_30 has a real representation as a 24-cell in 4-dimensional space. 3{4}3 has 24 vertices, and 24 3-edges. Its symmetry is 3[4]3, order 72.

=== Related 4-polytopes ===
Several uniform 4-polytopes can be derived from the 24-cell via truncation:
* truncating at 1/3 of the edge length yields the truncated 24-cell;
* truncating at 1/2 of the edge length yields the rectified 24-cell;
* and truncating at half the depth to the dual 24-cell yields the bitruncated 24-cell, which is cell-transitive.

The 96 edges of the 24-cell can be partitioned into the golden ratio to produce the 96 vertices of the snub 24-cell. This is done by first placing vectors along the 24-cell&#x27;s edges such that each two-dimensional face is bounded by a cycle, then similarly partitioning each edge into the golden ratio along the direction of its vector. An analogous modification to an octahedron produces an icosahedron, or &quot;snub octahedron.&quot;

The 24-cell is the unique convex self-dual regular Euclidean polytope that is neither a polygon nor a simplex. Relaxing the condition of convexity admits two further figures: the great 120-cell and grand stellated 120-cell. With itself, it can form a polytope compound: the compound of two 24-cells.

=== Related uniform polytopes ===


The 24-cell can also be derived as a rectified 16-cell:

<text>Cheontae is the Korean descendant of the Chinese Buddhist school Tiantai. Tiantai was introduced to Korea a couple of times during earlier periods, but was not firmly established until the time of Uicheon (1055-1101) who established Cheontae in Goryeo as an independent school.

Due to Uicheon&#x27;s influence, it came to be a major force in the world of Goryeo Buddhism. After he returned from Song China in 1086, Uicheon sought to ease conflict between the doctrinal Gyo () schools and Seon () schools, believing that the Cheontae doctrine would be effective to this end. Cheontae doctrine holds the Lotus Sutra as the peak of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings, and postulates the following:

* All things are empty and without essential reality.
* All things have a provisional reality.
* All things are both absolutely unreal and provisionally real at once.

In accordance with the Cheontae doctrine, all experiences in the sensory world are in fact expressions of Buddhist law (Dharma), and therefore contain the key to enlightenment. This explains the extravagant altars and the colorful dynamism found at Seon temples using Dancheong coloring, differing from the austere and monochromatic aesthetic of the Zen school, intellectually predominant in Japan from the Kamakura period onwards.

Cheontae as a school has been largely absorbed into the Jogye Seon tradition, but an independent Cheontae school has been revived and has an estimated 2 million adherents. The school&#x27;s headquarters are at Guinsa in Chungcheongbuk-do, near Danyang. The school also funds and operates the Buddhist university, Geumgang University.

<text>Flybe (pronounced ), styled as flybe, was a British airline based in Exeter, England. Launched in 1979 as Jersey European Airways, and renamed Flybe in 2002, at various points it was the largest independent regional airline in Europe, and provided more than half of the UK domestic flights outside of London.

Jersey European Airways (JEA) was formed in 1979 after the merger of Intra Airways and Express Air Services. In 1983, JEA was sold to Walker Steel Group, which also owned &quot;Spacegrand Aviation&quot;; the two airlines were merged under the Jersey European name during 1985. The airline experienced significant growth during the 1990s. It was renamed British European in 2000 and Flybe in 2002. On 3 November 2006, it was announced that Flybe was in the process of purchasing BA Connect. With the sale, the airline became the largest regional airline in Europe. On 10 December 2010, the company was floated in an IPO on the London Stock Exchange.

In February 2019, the airline was sold to the Connect Airways consortium, backed by Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Aviation. Connect Airways intended Flybe and Stobart Air to then rebrand as Virgin Connect, although they would have retained their own air operator certificates. On 5 March 2020, Flybe filed for administration and ceased operations. The airline, which had been struggling for several months, claimed that its difficulties were compounded by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bookings.

In October 2020, Thyme Opco, a company linked to former shareholder Cyrus Capital, agreed with the administrators to purchase the Flybe brand and relaunch the airline in 2021, subject to regulatory approvals. In April 2021, the new company renamed itself Flybe Limited, obtained an operating licence, route licences, and airport slots; the first flight took place on 13 April 2022. The relaunched airline ceased trading on 28 January 2023.

==History==
===Early years===


Flybe started operations on 1 November 1979 as &quot;Jersey European Airways&quot; as a result of a merger of the Intra Airways from Jersey and Express Air Services based in Bournemouth, England. It was founded by John Habin, a resident of Jersey and the majority investor. After selling Aviation Beauport and other business interests, Habin invested in the firm so that it could establish several routes from Jersey Airport to major airports in the UK. Initially equipped with an aging fleet of war-surplus Douglas DC-3 aircraft, Jersey European Airways gradually reequipped with more modern commuter airliners.

In November 1983, Habin sold his stake in Jersey European Airways to Jack Walker&#x27;s Walker Steel Group, which already owned the charter airline Spacegrand Aviation based in Blackpool, England. Initially, the two airlines were run separately although they partially shared management; Exeter Airport served as a critical hub, forming a meeting point between the two companies&#x27; route networks. In 1985, both airlines were amalgamated under the Jersey European name; the combined entity&#x27;s headquarters was established in Exeter, England. In 1985, Jersey European Airways carried 160,000 passengers and achieved an annual revenue of just under £9million.

During 1990, Jersey European Airways&#x27; passenger count rose to 460,000, being 40 percent greater than the previous year. During 1991, the airline commenced its first route to London, flying between Guernsey and London Gatwick Airport. In 1993, it received the first of its British Aerospace 146 aircraft, a four-engined jet-powered regional aircraft. That same year, the airline introduced a business class service aboard some aircraft. Around that time, the Exeter hub was supplemented by connections in both London and Birmingham, England. By 1995, Jersey European Airways was again expanding after incurring minor losses during the prior year.

In mid-1997, Jersey European Airways announced that it had achieved record results in its previous financial year amid a boom in Europe&#x27;s regional airlines market; in the same year, the firm secured a franchise arrangement with Air France covering routes from London Heathrow to Toulouse and Lyon, expanded its fleet to provide 32% more seat capacity, and recorded a 27% increase in sales while profits had risen by nearly a third to reach £3.4 million. That same year, the airline, which operated a mixed fleet of 12 British Aerospace 146s, four Fokker F27s and two Short 360s was in the process of leasing additional BAe 146s to cater for expansion. Jim French, Jersey European&#x27;s deputy chief executive, announced that the company was performing detailed studies with the aim of introducing larger airliners in the 150- to 170-seat class, such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families.

===2000–2010===

In June 2000, the airline announced that it had rebranded as &quot;British European&quot;; according to a company spokesperson, that was due to the Jersey European Airways name no longer being an accurate reflection of the scope of the routes which were covered. The name was soon shortened to simply &quot;Flybe&quot; on 18 July 2002 and the airline repositioned itself as a full-service, low-fare airline. Various pricing and product changes were made in line with this position such as discounted one-way tickets, the abolition of overbooking practices, a customer charter of the airline&#x27;s service standards, as well as compensation for delays.

In June 2005, it was announced that Flybe would procure a fleet of 26 Embraer E-195 regional airliners; it would claim that it had opted for the 118-seat E-195 over rival 150-seat aircraft due to economics and performance benefits. Flybe would serve as the launch customer for the E-195, receiving the first example of the type during the later half of 2006. Initially, the E-195 fleet were assigned to the airline&#x27;s high-volume trunk routes, but the firm later planned to use it on new routes to expand their network. Further E-195s would be ordered by the airline over the following decade, the type making up a major proportion of Flybe&#x27;s fleet.

On 3 November 2006, it was announced that Flybe would buy BA Connect, except for that airline&#x27;s services out of London City Airport. During March 2007, this takeover was completed; as a consequence of the BA Connect takeover, the ownership of Flybe was divided between Rosedale Aviation Holdings (69%), Flybe staff (16%) and the International Airlines Group (15%). The acquisition increased Flybe&#x27;s route network in both the UK and continental Europe, making Flybe Europe&#x27;s largest regional airline. On 14 January 2008, it was announced that Flybe had signed a franchise agreement with Scottish airline Loganair, to commence on 26 October 2008 following the termination of Loganair&#x27;s franchise agreement with British Airways on 25 October 2008. The agreement would see Loganair aircraft flying in Flybe colours on 55 routes from Scotland. In 2008, in order to avoid losing a £280,000 rebate from Norwich Airport, Flybe advertised for &quot;actors&quot;, as well as offering free return flights to Dublin on its website. As a result, the environmental group Friends of the Earth called on the government to launch an investigation into the aviation industry.

Chief Executive Officer Jim French was recognised in the 2009 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List with a CBE for his services to the airline industry. On 10 December 2010, Flybe floated in an IPO on the London Stock Exchange, with trading in shares commencing on the same day. Full public release of shares followed on 15 December 2010. The share price was set at 295p, valuing the company at approximately £215million, and raising £66million for the company, half of which was to pay for fleet expansion.

===2011–2020===
On 23 May 2013, it was reported that Flybe had sold its slots at Gatwick Airport to EasyJet for £20million, and that the slots would be handed over to EasyJet on 29 March 2014. CEO and chairman Jim French retired in August 2013, leaving the post of CEO to Saad Hammad, formerly of EasyJet, while Simon Laffin became chairman. By November 2013, Hammad had shaken up the operation, requesting the resignations of three top managers within six weeks of his arrival. Out of 158 routes flown at the time, over 60 did not cover their direct operating expenses and the costs of crew and aircraft.

On 23 April 2014, Flybe announced that it would launch domestic and international flights from London City Airport from 27 October 2014 after signing a five-year deal with the airport. The airline was expecting to carry around 500,000 passengers a year, with all five allocated aircraft being based around the Flybe network overnight. In March 2014, it was announced that Flybe would undergo a major brand refresh. This new scheme included a new purple aircraft livery, new interior features and new uniforms. During June 2014, British Airways sold most of its remaining stake in the airline; it had already been reduced to 5% by share issues.

In early 2016, it was announced that Flybe had negotiated a six-year agreement with SAS Scandinavian Airlines to fly 4 ATR 72–9 aircraft on their behalf, starting in October 2016. On 4 March 2015, Flybe announced new routes from Cardiff Airport bringing the number of routes to eleven. Flybe also stated their intention to create a new base at Cardiff Airport in summer 2015, initially basing two Embraer 195 aircraft there, which subsequently increased to three. On 10 November 2015, Flybe announced that it would base two Embraer 195 aircraft at Doncaster Sheffield Airport in South Yorkshire, starting new routes to Amsterdam, Berlin Tegel, Paris Charles de Gaulle (Paris CDG), Jersey, Alicante Airport, Málaga, Faro, Portugal and Newquay Cornwall Airport . The announcement came on the same day that Flybe announced they would be pulling flights from Bournemouth Airport in England. Dublin Airport was added in October 2016, taking over where Stobart Air left. On 26 October 2016, it was announced that Hammad would be standing down as CEO with immediate effect and consequently, Flybe was beginning the process of finding a replacement. On 21 November 2016, Flybe announced it would open its first European base at Düsseldorf Airport in Germany. In February 2017 that commenced with two aircraft alongside 60 pilots, cabin crew and engineers. On 22 December 2016, Flybe started selling flights for 12 further destinations from Southend Airport in London in an extension to their existing franchise operation with Stobart Air.

Flybe and Loganair separately announced that their franchise agreement would terminate in October 2017. Flybe then announced a partnership with Eastern Airways, a British airline and would now operate routes in direct competition with Loganair–namely flights from the Scottish mainland to Stornoway in the Isle of Lewis, Kirkwall in Orkney, Scotland and Sumburgh in Shetland, Scotland. On 16 January 2017, former CityJet boss Christine Ourmieres-Widener, took over as CEO after Saad Hammad left in October 2016. Later in the year, Flybe began flying from Heathrow to Aberdeen Airport and Edinburgh taking over slots previously used by Virgin Atlantic Little Red.

On 22 February 2018, franchise partner Stobart Air confirmed interest in a takeover bid of 100% of Flybe for an undisclosed fee. However that bid was rejected by the carrier and Stobart scrapped its interest on 22 March 2018, causing share prices in the airline, which had climbed by up to 25% following the bid, to drop back to their previous level. In September 2018, a revised aircraft livery was launched, with purple and white being retained but lilac replacing the red and yellow. On 14 November 2018, after the airline&#x27;s shares fell by 75%, Flybe announced that it was talking with various parties about a potential sale of the business, as part of a wide-ranging review of strategic options. On 22 November, news emerged that Virgin Atlantic was one of the parties with which Flybe had been holding discussions; Flybe&#x27;s slots at Heathrow were of particular interest to Virgin Atlantic, along with the potential to use Flybe to feed passengers into the Virgin Atlantic hubs in Manchester and London Heathrow.

====Connect Airways takeover====
On 11 January 2019, a takeover bid worth £2.2million by the Connect Airways consortium, which includes Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Aviation, was confirmed. The consortium planned to lend £20million enabling Flybe to continue operations and would take over Stobart Air; when the acquisition is completed it would provide a further £80million. The initial deal, which would have been conditional on shareholder and court approval, was expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2019. Flybe and Stobart Air would operate under the Virgin Atlantic brand though they would retain their own air operator certificates. Optimisation of Flybe&#x27;s routes would likely result in a &quot;limited reduction&quot; in its fleet.

On 15 January 2019, Connect Airways increased its offer by £600,000, and set out improved bridging loan conditions, with £10million to be released immediately to support Flybe&#x27;s business and a further £10million available. Subsequent funding of £80million was also confirmed. In accepting the revised offer, Flybe&#x27;s board said that it provided the security which the business needed and preserved the interests of its stakeholders, customers, employees, partners, and pension members. The deal which covered Flybe Group&#x27;s operating subsidiaries, i.e. the airline and the website, would be completed by 22 February 2019.

Flybe Group&#x27;s shareholders had decided in December 2018 to transfer its final shares to a standard listing, meaning that shareholder approval for the sale of the assets was no longer required. Notwithstanding the change, on 21 January 2019 one of the largest shareholders, Hosking Partners, threatened legal action to block the deal which it believed undervalued the company. On 4 February 2019, Flybe confirmed that it had received a valid request from Hosking Partners to convene a general meeting in order to appoint a new director, but noted that Flybe&#x27;s articles of association did not give members the powers needed for the new director&#x27;s proposed investigation of the sale. It confirmed that it had received and rejected, a preliminary alternative bid from former Stobart CEO Andrew Tinkler. On 7 February, Flybe Group warned its shareholders that after the sale of the operating assets, the parent company would be wound up if they did not approve its sale. On 20 February, Flybe said it had rejected an alternative &quot;preliminary and highly conditional contingency proposal&quot; from Mesa Air Group in Phoenix and supported by Tinkler, noting that it could not be executed quickly enough to enable the airline to continue trading.

On 21 February 2019, Flybe announced that the sale of Flybe Limited and Flybe.com Limited to Connect Airways had been completed, with Flybe flights continuing to operate as normal. The sale of the parent company, Flybe Group plc, now an empty shell, was confirmed by its shareholders at a meeting on 4 March and became effective on 11 March. In October 2019, it was announced that Flybe would be rebranded as Virgin Connect, reflecting its incorporation into the Virgin Group, with effect from early 2020. The Virgin Group launched a landing page to avoid confusion with the existing Virgin Connect brand used in Russia for internet &amp; mobile services.

In January 2020, it emerged that Flybe was again in difficulties, incurring mounting losses despite the financing provided by Connect Airways. A deal was reached on 15 January, entailing a deferred payment plan for Flybe&#x27;s tax debts and increased funding from Connect Airways. The UK government also agreed to conduct an urgent review of Air Passenger Duty on domestic flights. By January 2020, Flybe operated 36% of all UK domestic flights (ahead of the UK&#x27;s two largest airlines, British Airways and EasyJet), carrying 26% of domestic passengers (behind British Airways and EasyJet which operate larger types of aircraft). In February 2020, the UK government envisaged granting Flybe a £100million rescue loan, and held talks with the EU Commission to ensure that state aid rules were not broken. In early March, the airline faced concern over the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bookings, casting doubt on whether the loan would be granted.

====End of operations====

In the early morning of 5 March 2020, the airline filed for administration and ceased all operations with immediate effect after the UK government failed to grant a proposed £100million ($129million) loan. Virgin Atlantic said that Connect Airways could &quot;no longer commit to continued financial support&quot; despite its investment of over £135million; Virgin Atlantic placed part of the blame on the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Flybe&#x27;s trading. All flights operated by Flybe and Stobart Air were cancelled, although those operated by franchisees Blue Islands, an airline in the Channel Islands and Eastern Airways continued. The chief executive, Mark Anderson, said that Flybe had made &quot;every possible attempt&quot; to prevent the collapse but were &quot;unable to overcome significant funding challenges&quot;.

As of 1 May 2020, Flybe&#x27;s administrators EY believed that a sale of the business as a going concern remained possible, having received around 20 non-binding offers including three for the entire business and assets, and expected to receive final offers for evaluation in early May. They appealed to the UK transport secretary to ensure that Flybe&#x27;s operating licence is not revoked, as this would prevent the sale of the valuable airport slots. The appeal was successful, and on 9 July the CAA withdrew its revocation decision. Further legal action remained, relating to Flybe&#x27;s slots at Heathrowwhich have been taken over by British Airways parent IAGand to its air operator certificate.

===Relaunch===

On 19 October 2020, reports emerged that Lucien Farrell, in charge of former shareholder Cyrus Capital&#x27;s London office, had formed a new company, Thyme Opco, to purchase the Flybe brand and relaunch the airline, subject to regulatory approvals. The new owner planned to &quot;start small and restore regional connectivity in the UK&quot; from 2021. On 1 December 2020, Thyme Opco applied for a UK operating licence. 
Thyme Opco also registered a 21-year-old Q400, which was expected to be the first aircraft for the &#x27;new Flybe&#x27;; since then the jet was acquired by PAL Airlines, a regional airline in Eastern Canada. In April 2021, the British CAA granted the new airline an operating licence as well as Type A and B route licences, enabling the carrier to operate both charter and scheduled services. The new company also obtained 86 slots at Heathrow for the summer 2021 season, to be used for flights to Edinburgh and Aberdeen, but the airline was not relaunched in time to use these slots.

The &#x27;original&#x27; Flybe company was renamed FBE Realisations 2021 Limited, with Thyme Opco Limited becoming Flybe Limited. On 3 June 2021, the operating licence for the original company was revoked following an unsuccessful appeal to the Transport Secretary. Despite initial beliefs that its legacy slots at UK airports had returned to the slot coordinator, that was shown not to be the case by coordinator ACL. The new operating company also leased Heathrow slots from British Airways for routes to Edinburgh and Aberdeen.

On 26 October 2021, the new Flybe Limited confirmed that it had appointed David Pflieger as its chief executive. That closely followed the appearance of an ex-Flybe Q400, registered as G-JECX, which had been painted with a new purple-and-white livery. In November 2021, the airline announced that it had picked Birmingham Airport as its new base, with operations scheduled to begin in early 2022 to &quot;key regions across the UK and EU&quot;. On 16 March 2022, Flybe announced that it would start ticket sales the following week, and that Belfast would be the airline&#x27;s second operating base. The company slogan was &quot;Smile and go the extra mile.&quot; On 22 March the company&#x27;s website opened for bookings; the first flight took place on 13 April 2022.

On 28 January 2023, Flybe entered administration and ceased all operations. On 18 March 2024, administration of the original Flybe (FBE Realisations 2021 Limited) ceased and the company was dissolved.

==Corporate affairs==

===Ownership and structure===

The former owner, Flybe Group plc, was a public company listed on the London Stock Exchange (). Until November 2013, the main shareholder, with 48.1% of the shares, was Rosedale Aviation Holdings Limited, the corporate representative of the trustee of the Jack Walker 1987 Settlement, which was established by the late Jack Walker, who was involved in Flybe&#x27;s early development.

In the UK, Flybe&#x27;s largest base was at Birmingham Airport; the airline had other large bases at Belfast City, Manchester and Southampton airports, with a total of 14 crew and aircraft who were based across the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The airline held a Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats. The Flybe Group included Flybe Aviation Services (engineering and maintenance), Flybe Training Academy (engineering and flight crew training), Flybe UK (airline operations) and Flybe Europe, the holding company for all European operations, which previously consisted of Flybe Nordic.

===Business trends===
Trends for Flybe Group during the period 2007–2018 are shown below (as at year ending 31 March):

===Joint ventures and franchises===

Loganair, a Scottish airline, was the first franchise partner for Flybe and operated a number of flights in Scotland and Ireland under a franchise agreement from 2008. Loganair aircraft wore the full Flybe livery during the time of the franchise. In 2016, it was announced that the agreement was to end on 31 August 2017 at which time Loganair would become an independent carrier.

In 2014, Flybe signed their second franchise agreement with Stobart Air, and initially started operating European routes from Southend Airport. In 2015, Stobart Air began operating more flights on behalf of Flybe from Ronaldsway Airport, Isle of Man using two ATR 72. In 2017, Flybe and Stobart Air began operating additional services from Southend Airport using Flybe Embraer 195 jet aircraft.

On 11 January 2016, Flybe announced its third franchise deal with the Jersey based airline, Blue Islands. Now all Blue Islands flights operated under the Flybe name, and the Blue Islands aircraft livery was replaced with the current Flybe livery from May 2016. However the deal was under investigation and was reported to potentially break local competition laws.

From 1 September 2017, Eastern Airways became a new franchise partner for Flybe taking over routes previously operated by Loganair from Aberdeen Airport, Glasgow Airport and Edinburgh Airport. That meant both Flybe and Loganair were now in direct competition with each other. In January 2018, services to Sumburgh were being withdrawn, owing to the competition with Loganair and the route being unable to sustain two carriers. It was announced that Loganair was withdrawing services from Glasgow to Manchester leaving Flybe as the sole operator on that route.

Flybe purchased Finncomm Airlines with Finnair of Finland in July 2011, and on 30 October 2011 rebranded the airline as Flybe Nordic. The joint venture operated its own routes along with franchise routes under a codeshare agreement for Finnair, operating under Flybe&#x27;s BE-code. Flybe agreed to sell its 60% stake in Flybe Nordic in November 2014 for €1, in an attempt to reduce group costs. On 1 May 2015, Flybe Nordic began operating solely for Finnair as it was no longer a part of Flybe. Flybe Nordic is now known as Nordic Regional Airlines – Norra.

===Sponsorship===
Flybe was the main sponsor of Exeter City Football Club and also sponsored the Exeter Chiefs with their branding featured on both teams&#x27; shirts. Flybe had also sponsored the ITV Weather forecasts on ITV Channel Television, ITV Cymru Wales, ITV Meridian, ITV West Country, STV, UTV, and the sport sections of the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, the &quot;Express &amp; Echo&quot; (Exeter), the &quot;South Wales Echo&quot; (Cardiff), the &quot;Isle of Man Courier&quot; and the &quot;Isle of Man Examiner&quot;.

Flybe had previously sponsored Birmingham City FC (2003–2007), Norwich City FC (2006–2008), Southampton FC (2006–2010), and Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC (2007–2010).

Flybe used the Avios frequent-flyer program until 30 April 2019, when Flybe and Avios ended their partnership and all accounts were closed. The programme is operated by the IAG subsidiary Avios Group.

====Cabin and service====
Flybe&#x27;s cabin interiors were configured with a single-class all-economy layout. It operated an allocated seating policy on its flights. Passengers had the option to choose a specific seat of their choice online in advance for a fee or have one allocated free of charge during online check-in or at the airport check-in. The airline operated a buy on board programme, called &quot;Café Flybe&quot;, offering food and drinks for purchase. On most flights to and from the Channel Islands a selection of duty free spirits and tobacco items was also available for purchase.

Passengers had the option of three ticket types, &quot;Just Fly&quot;, &quot;Get More&quot; and &quot;All In&quot;.
* &quot;Just Fly&quot; was the most basic ticket type, with just the flight included and extra options available to add for an additional fee.
* &quot;Get More&quot; ticket holders were able to reserve a seat and take a 23 kg hold bag.
* &quot;All In&quot; ticket holders received a complimentary drink and snack, access to Flybe Executive Lounges, free pre-booked seating, priority check-in, and two hold bags.

===Fleet strategy and developments===

Flybe retired its final Embraer 195 in February 2020, which was returned to lessors once it was retired. It had said that the Q400 would be the backbone of its fleet going forward.

====Dash 8 Q400====

Flybe became the world&#x27;s largest operator of the Dash 8 Q400 after it added 24 jets leased from Republic Airways, a US regional airline, in 2014. In May 2007, the airline signed a deal with Bombardier, an aircraft manufacturer in Montreal, Canada for a further 15 Q400 aircraft valued at US$394million (£197million), with options for a further 15, increasing its fleet of the type to 60. In September 2014, Republic Airways agreed to lease 24 of their Q400 aircraft to Flybe with delivery over two years starting from March 2018. In June 2017, Flybe announced that due to a loss of near to £20million, it would retire six Q400 aircraft in 2017.

When Flybe collapsed in March 2020 its 54 Dash 8 Q400s were placed into storage. In January 2021, aerial firefighting airline specialist Conair Group in Abbotsford, British Columbia in Canada announced that it had purchased 11 of Flybe&#x27;s Q400 for conversion into water bombers and multi-role firefighting aircraft.

====Embraer 175====

On 20 July 2010, Flybe placed an order for 35 Embraer 175 aircraft worth US$1.3 billion (£850million), with options for 65 more (value $2.3billion/£1.5billion) and purchase rights for a further 40 (value $1.4billion/£0.9billion). The 88-seat aircraft was originally planned to be delivered between July 2011 and March 2017; with the first two aircraft arriving in November 2011. In September 2014, Flybe agreed with Embraer to cancel 20 orders for the E-175 jets and deferred delivery of the other four until further notice. 

In 2020 Flybe&#x27;s nine E175s were transferred to various lessors when they collapsed. Six of the new aircraft which had been acquired went to a company in Bermuda called Flybe Leasing, with CAW Finance Corp acquiring another one.

====Embraer 195====

The airline placed an order for 14 Embraer 195 aircraft in June 2005, plus options on an additional 12 aircraft, making it the type&#x27;s worldwide launch customer. In the same month, four existing Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 options were converted into firm orders; after delivery its fleet of Q400s numbered 45. Flybe received its first 118-seat Embraer 195 in September 2006, and the aircraft began to replace its existing BAe 146s, completing the fleet rationalisation which was started in 2003. The E-195s were fitted with a head-up guidance system (HGS) and configured to offer single-class service.

In 2018, Flybe completed a review of its future fleet deciding that the Bombardier Q400 would continue to be its core aircraft; all nine of its E195 aircraft were to be withdrawn by 2020 but some E175s would be retained for busier routes. On 3 April 2019, Flybe confirmed its intention to withdraw six of its E195s in 2019 and the remainder in 2020; its bases at Cardiff and Doncaster would be closed and these destinations served by Q400s from other bases.

The last Embraer 195 was retired and returned to its lessor on 24 February 2020.

===Historical fleet===



Flybe previously operated the following aircraft:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 1 August 2008 an Embraer 190-200LR from Manchester to Belfast City Airport suffered a failure of the No. 1 air cycle machine (ACM), releasing smoke and fumes into the aircraft. A Mayday was declared and an expeditious diversion was carried out. After donning oxygen masks the pilots of Flybe flight BE484 had great difficulty communicating with each other, ATC and cabin crew, because of technical problems with the masks. During the emergency evacuation the right overwing emergency exit door became jammed and unusable. Passengers who evacuated via the left overwing exit were unaware of how to get from the wing down to the ground. Several recommendations were made as a result of the incident.
*On 21 July 2012 a Flybe aircraft with 47 passengers on board from Cornwall Airport Newquay to Edinburgh made an emergency landing and was evacuated at Edinburgh after a short circuit in a smoke detector triggered a fire alarm. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch noted pilots initiated a checklist inappropriately for the false alarm, causing depressurisation of the cabin, loss of displays on the copilot side and disconnection of the autopilot. Flybe retrained their pilots and took action to eradicate future false alarms from similar short circuits.
* On 23 February 2017 a De Havilland Canada Dash 8 registered G-JECP from Edinburgh to Amsterdam suffered a collapse of the right main gear upon landing at Schiphol Airport resulting in severe damage to the aircraft. Damage was found to the lower fuselage structure, right-hand outboard wing tip and nose landing gear along with damage to the right-hand fuselage caused by fragments from the right (#2) engine and debris and gravel from the runway. After the aircraft came to a stop, the crew declared a Mayday and initiated an evacuation of the aircraft. The accident was caused by deformation in the right-hand landing-gear yoke causing the landing gear to be in the down but unlocked position while the gear position indicator in the cockpit displayed three green lights falsely indicating to the crew the gear was in a down and locked position. The Dutch Safety Board made several recommendations to Bombardier, Flybe and the landing gear manufacturer.
*On 10 November 2017 a Flybe De Havilland Canada Dash 8 suffered a nose gear failure after takeoff from Belfast City Airport to Inverness Airport, diverting to Belfast International Airport and partially landing on its nose. The underside of the nose, forward pressure bulkhead, and the nose gear as well as its doors were damaged and there were two injuries. The accident was caused by a faulty sensor causing the doors to close onto the gear while it retracted. Flybe inspected their entire fleet. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch noted the aircraft and landing gear manufacturers were already working on a revised design prior to the accident.
*On 11 January 2018 a Flybe Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 flying to Glasgow Airport made an unintentional descent due to an incorrect autopilot setting shortly after departing Belfast City Airport. The plane descended from 1,500 feet to 928 feet over eighteen seconds reaching a maximum rate of descent of 4,300 feet per minute. Flybe revised their simulator training and pre-takeoff checklists in response.
*On 28 February 2019 a Flybe Embraer 195 destined for Alicante, Spain aborted takeoff and was evacuated on the runway at Exeter Airport after the copilot noticed smoke from an air conditioning vent before fumes began entering the aircraft. The evacuation left a passenger and a member of cabin crew injured. The rapid engine shutdown meant that wing flaps were not correctly positioned for evacuation, leaving a large drop for those attempting to use overwing exits, some of whom reentered the cabin and evacuated via slides. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch made recommendations to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States proposing changes to the design and layout of emergency exits on commercial aircraft.
*On 14 November 2019 a Flybe DHC-8-400 destined for Heathrow Airport made a precautionary emergency landing at Exeter Airport. Shortly after departing from Cornwall Airport Newquay, the flight crew noticed that their handwheels required significant offsets for the aircraft to maintain level flight. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch concluded that a broken left aileron cable was responsible; they also discovered that the right aileron on the aircraft and others in the fleet sometimes failed to respond to handwheel inputs. Although Flybe ceased operations before the probe was concluded, airlines and the plane&#x27;s manufacturer made changes to design and maintenance. The report also criticised the use of irreversible filters, which are banned in the United States, on the flight data recorder resulting in the loss of relevant data.

<text>Surin (, ; , ; ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-seven provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;). It lies in lower northeastern Thailand, also called Isan. Neighboring provinces are (from west clockwise) Buriram, Maha Sarakham, Roi Et, and Sisaket. To the south it borders Oddar Meancheay of Cambodia. Surin covers a total area of from the Mun River in the north to the Dangrek Mountains in the south. The capital, Surin city, in the western central region province is from Bangkok.

The area of present-day Surin has long history of human settlement which dates back to prehistoric times. Historically the region has been ruled by various powerful kingdoms including the Angkorian Khmer Empire, the Lao kingdom Lan Xang, and the Thai kingdom of Ayutthaya. Reflecting this history as part the greater geo-cultural area of Thailand known as Isan, Surin is ethnically diverse. The primary language is the Isan dialect of Lao. Speakers of Central Thai account for a small minority while nearly 50% of the population are ethnic Khmer. The remainder are speakers of various Lao languages and small tribal groups such as the Kuy and Nyah Kur.

The northeast provinces have traditionally been isolated, both physically and culturally, from the rest of Thailand and Surin is no exception. The vast majority of the province is rural and relatively poor. There is little industrial development with rice farming being the primary industry. Rice farmers supplement their income by cutting sugar cane, as construction laborers, or working in the local silk weaving trade. Elephant capture and training is also an important industry in Surin. Approximately 25 percent of all the elephants in the kingdom are raised in Surin, predominantly by the ethnic Kuy people.

Tourism is also important to the Surin economy. Elephants and scenery are increasingly seen as potentially lucrative by the provincial government which has attempted to make Surin a destination for international ecotourism. Domestically, Surin has a reputation for its fine silk and silver beaded ornaments produced in tourist-focused villages such as Khwao Sinaring Handicraft Village. Local traders also conduct cross-border commerce with Cambodians through a border crossing at Chong Chom, south of Surin city.

==Name==
According to legend, the province was given its current name in 1786 in honor of its royal governor, Chiangpum, whose royal title was &quot;Luang Surin Phakdi&quot;. The &quot;Surin&quot; portion of the title is a compound of two words, สุระ and อินทร์, derived from the Sanskrit words &quot;sura&quot; (Devanagari: सुर), meaning &#x27;god&#x27; (cf. Asura), and &quot;Intar&quot; (Devanagari: इन्द्र), &quot;Indra&quot;.

Prior to the 14th century, the area was part of the Khmer empire in its province of &quot;Kok Khan&quot; (). The name of the region during the period after the fall of the Khmer Empire until acquiring its current name has been lost to history.

==Geography==
Surin lies at the center of the southern edge of the Khorat Plateau, a relatively low-lying interior region isolated from the rest of Southeast Asia by surrounding mountain ranges. The south of the province is dominated by the Dongrek mountain range, the escarpment of which demarcates the watershed boundaries and also forms the international border with Cambodia. The mountains, averaging approximately 500m in elevation, are not particularly high but the southward sides are steep cliffs rising rather abruptly from the northern plains of Cambodia significantly hindering any attempt at passing. The main pass in the region is in Surin and cuts through the mountains between Chong Chom and O Smach, Cambodia.

The northern face of the mountain range slopes gently down leveling out into the rolling flood plains that make up the central and northern regions of Surin. These areas are drained by small meandering streams which run roughly south-to-north and drain into the Mun River, which cuts through the extreme north of the province flowing east to eventually empty into the Mekong. As the third longest river in Thailand and second largest by volume of water, the Mun has been important in the region since prehistoric times.

The northwestern area of Surin is a panhandle that juts westward into Buriram province at the confluence of the Mun with Chi Creek (), which flows down from the Dangrek mountains, passing just west of the provincial capital of Surin city, and forms most of the western provincial border between Surin and Buriram. The Mun river valley forms the southern provincial border of this panhandle before extending somewhat diagonally northeast, opening up into a large lake near Tha Tum. Leaving the lake, the Mun continues on to meet the provincial border with Roi Et province just west of Road 215, effectively cutting off the mainly agricultural panhandle area from the rest of Surin. From there, the Mun River continues eastward forming the northern provincial boundary of Surin all the way to the confluence with the Thap Than Creek () that forms the eastern border of Surin with Sisaket province.

The total forest area is or 8.4 percent of provincial area.

===Wildlife sanctuary===
There is one wildlife sanctuary, along with five other wildlife sanctuaries, make up region 9 (Ubon Ratchathani) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Huai Thap Than–Huai Samran Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into 17 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further divided into 158 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 2011 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Surin Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 28 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Surin has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 27 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 144 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Climate==
Due to its position in the Khorat Plateau, the climate of Surin is largely affected by the surrounding mountains which block much of the rain that would otherwise be carried to the province by the monsoons. This results in lower annual rainfall totals and greater differences between the rainy and dry seasons than areas outside the plateau.

==History==
===Prehistory===
Archaeological sites in the Khorat Plateau have provided some of the earliest evidence of pottery, metallurgy and developed wet rice cultivation in Southeast Asia. The Mun river valley and surrounding basin has supported rice growing cultures since prehistoric times. The earliest settlers in the region were hunter-gatherers. The Neolithic period, which saw the introduction of agriculture, dates from 2,500 to 1,500 years BCE. The Bronze Age follows from 1,500 to 500 BCE, and the Iron Age from 500 BCE to 500 CE. The first evidence of human settlement in Surin emerges in the Iron Age, with approximately 60 known Iron Age sites. These prehistoric settlers are assumed to be ancestors of the various Mon-Khmer peoples prevalent in the area today.

===Historical period===

The earliest known historical period is the Dvaravati. This was an Indian-based culture, which defused through the northeast region of what is now Thailand. Evidence of this culture is found in Surin region dating to between the 7th–11th centuries CE. It was in this period that Buddhism became the dominant religion of the region.

Following the Dvaravati period, the powerful Khmer Empire expanded its influence throughout what is now the southern Isan region of Thailand. This period covers the 7th–13th centuries CE. Surin was an important part of the ancient Khmer empire. Temple ruins and a substantial ethnic Khmer minority remain part of Surin. Khmer stone inscriptions date from c. 600 CE. Over the next several centuries a growing number of Khmer sites were constructed in the province, most notably Prasat Sikhoraphum. These sites would have formed part of the network of Khmer infrastructure centred on Prasat Phanom Rung.

With the collapse of the Khmer empire in the 15th century, Surin faded from history, not to re-emerge until the 18th century. According to legend, a local Kuay leader named Chiangpum presented a rare white elephant to Chao Phaya Chakri, the future King Rama I. In gratitude, he awarded Chiangpum the royal title &quot;Luang Surin Phakdi&quot; and appointed him village headman. When he became monarch, Rama I named Luang Surin Phakdi as the provincial governor. In 1763 Chiangpum&#x27;s village moved 15 kilometers to its present location and was upgraded to a city named &quot;Muang Prathai Saman&quot;. According to tradition, the move was due to better water at the new site. In 1786 the name was changed to Surin in honor of its royal governor.

The province slowly grew as people returned to the area. Although there was a continual influx of people from the surrounding areas, Surin was largely self-sufficient and remained somewhat isolated until the arrival of the railroad in 1922. Chinese and Indian merchants settled in the city, manufacturing increased, and Surin gradually became a modern metropolis.

==Culture==
As in most of Isan, the primary culture of Surin is that of the ethnic Lao people who inhabit the region. Within Thailand, the preferred nomenclature for this culture is &quot;Thai-Isan&quot; to enforce their identity as Thai citizens and differentiate them from the Lao of Laos, but the culture of the region is markedly different from central Thais. The Isan language is a dialect of Lao, although mutually intelligible with central Thai. The Thai-Isan of Surin are associated with Lao dress, Lao-influenced music (e.g., the &quot;khene&quot; and &quot;mor lam&quot;) and Lao-style cuisine, which includes sticky rice in contrast to the jasmine rice preferred by central Thais.

Due to Surin&#x27;s significant Khmer population, aspects of Northern Khmer culture are also common in the province including the Northern Khmer language and their &quot;kantrum&quot; and &quot;chrieng brunh&quot; music forms. The historical impact of the Khmer on the culture of the region is evident in the numerous Khmer temples and ruins that dot the landscape of Surin. As the Khmer prefer jasmine rice, much of Surin&#x27;s rice production is geared toward this crop.

The culture of Surin is also strongly influenced by the Kuy people, most visibly in the activity surrounding elephants that is so prominent in the province. Surin is the source of approximately a quarter of all domesticated elephants in Thailand and the capture, training, and raising of these elephants is conducted by people of Kuy ethnicity. This is such an important activity to Surin and a source of pride to the Kuy people, that celebrations such as Thai Elephant Day () and the Surin Elephant Round-up are held annually on the second and third weeks, respectively, of November. The festivals include light and sound shows describing the legends of the Thai elephants and a fair at Si Narong Stadium featuring parades, floats, contests such as tug of war between elephants and men and demonstrations of war elephants.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal is an image of Indra atop his celestial white elephant, Airavata which is based on the design found on a famous Khmer temple in the province. Both Khmer temples and elephants are commonly found in Surin.

The provincial tree and flower is the common tembusu (&quot;Fagraea fragrans&quot;). Smallscale mud carp (&quot;Cirrhinus microlepis&quot;) is the provincial fish.

==Economy==

Surin province produces high-quality jasmine rice. It is also known for its silk. This quality is due to its weaving process, as well as its patterns and dyes.

==Demographics==
In Thailand&#x27;s 2000 census it was reported that 99.5 percent of the province&#x27;s population were Thai nationals; 29.3 percent of the population ranged from age 0–14, 60.9 percent ranged from 15 to 59, and 9.8 percent of the population is 60 and over.

Surin is a province with a sizable Northern Khmer population. It was reported that 47.2 percent of the population are capable of speaking the Khmer language. This is down from the 1990 census where it was reported that 63.4 percent of the population spoke Khmer.

A third large minority group, the Kuy people, also reside in Surin. Also spelled &quot;Guay&quot;, &quot;Suai&quot; or &quot;Kha&quot; (pejoratively), the Kuy are a Mon-Khmer people distantly related to the Khmer and considered by many Thais to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the region. A 1985 study found that 9.6 percent of the people in Surin were Kuy, 9.2 percent were mixed Lao-Kuy, and 3.1 percent were mixed Khmer-Kuy. Kuy people speak the Kuy language and most traditionally followed animist beliefs although a syncretic blend of animism with the local Theravada Buddhism is now more common.

<doc id="293489" wikidata="Q855964" url="?curid=293489" title="Tendai">
<text>, also known as the Tendai Lotus School (天台法華宗 &quot;Tendai hokke shū,&quot; sometimes just &quot;hokke shū&quot;), is a Mahāyāna Buddhist tradition with significant esoteric elements that was officially established in Japan in 806 by the Japanese monk Saichō (posthumously known as Dengyō Daishi). The Tendai school, which has been based on Mount Hiei since its inception, rose to prominence during the Heian period (794–1185). It gradually eclipsed the powerful &quot;Hossō&quot; school and competed with the rival Shingon school to become the most influential sect at the Imperial court.

By the Kamakura period (1185–1333), Tendai had become one of the dominant forms of Japanese Buddhism, with numerous temples and vast landholdings. During the Kamakura period, various monks left Tendai (seeing it as corrupt) to establish their own &quot;new&quot; or &quot;Kamakura&quot; Buddhist schools such as Jōdo-shū, Jōdo Shinshū, Nichiren-shū and Sōtō Zen. The destruction of the head temple of Enryaku-ji by Oda Nobunaga in 1571, as well as the geographic shift of the capital away from Kyoto to Edo, further weakened Tendai&#x27;s influence.

In Chinese and Japanese, its name is identical to Tiantai, its parent Chinese Buddhism school. Both traditions emphasize the importance of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; and revere the teachings of Tiantai patriarchs, especially Zhiyi. In English, the Japanese romanization &quot;Tendai&quot; is used to refer specifically to the Japanese school. According to Hazama Jikō, the main characteristic of Tendai &quot;is its advocacy of a comprehensive Buddhism, the ideal of a Buddhist school based on what is called the &quot;One Great Perfect Teaching,&quot; the idea that all the teachings of the Buddha are ultimately without contradiction and can be unified in one comprehensive and perfect system.&quot;

Other unique elements include an exclusive use of the bodhisattva precepts for ordination (without the pratimoksha), a practice tradition based on the &quot;Four Integrated Schools&quot; (Pure Land, Zen, Mikkyo and Precepts), and an emphasis on the study of Chinese Esoteric Buddhist sources. David W. Chappell sees Tendai as &quot;the most comprehensive and diversified&quot; Buddhist tradition which provides a religious framework that is &quot;suited to adapt to other cultures, to evolve new practices, and to universalize Buddhism.&quot;

== History ==

=== Foundation by Saichō ===
Although Jianzhen (Jp. &quot;Ganjin&quot;) had brought Tiantai teachings to Japan as early as 754, its teachings did not take root until generations later when the monk Saichō 最澄 (767–822) joined the Japanese missions to Imperial China in 804 and founded Enryaku-ji on Mount Hiei. The future founder of Shingon Buddhism, Kūkai, also traveled on the same mission; however, the two were on separate ships and there is no evidence of their meeting during this period.

From the city of Ningbo (then called &quot;Míngzhōu&quot; 明州), Saichō was introduced by the governor to Dàosuì (道邃), who was the seventh Tiantai patriarch, and later he journeyed to Tiantai Mountain for further study. After receiving teachings and initiations on Chan, Precepts and Chinese Esoteric Buddhism, Saichō devoted much of his time to making accurate copies of Tiantai texts and studying under Dàosuì. By the sixth month of 805, Saichō had returned to Japan along with the official mission to China. Saichō was also influenced by his study of Huayan (Jp. Kegon) philosophy under Gyōhyō 行表 (720–797) and this was his initial training before going to China.

Because of the Imperial Court&#x27;s interest in Tiantai as well as esoteric Buddhism, Saichō quickly rose in prominence upon his return. He was asked by Emperor Kanmu (735–806) to perform various esoteric rituals, and Saichō also sought recognition from the Emperor for a new, independent Tendai school in Japan. Because the emperor sought to reduce the power of the Hossō school, he granted this request, but with the stipulation that the new &quot;Tendai&quot; school would have two programs: one for esoteric Buddhism and one for exoteric Buddhist practice.

The new Tendai school was therefore based on a combination of the doctrinal and meditative system of Zhiyi with esoteric Buddhist practice and texts. Tendai learning at Mount Hiei traditionally followed two curriculums:

* &quot;Shikan-gō&quot; 止觀業: Exoteric practice, mainly based on Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;Mohezhiguan&quot;
* &quot;Shana-gō&quot; 遮那業: Esoteric Buddhism, focused on the &quot;Mahāvairocana-sūtra&quot; and other tantric works

However, Emperor Kanmu died shortly thereafter, and Saichō was not allocated any ordinands until 809 with the reign of Emperor Saga. Saichō&#x27;s choice of establishing his community at Mount Hiei also proved fortuitous because it was located at the northeast of the new capital of Kyoto and thus was auspicious in terms of Chinese geomancy as the city&#x27;s protector.

==== Disagreements with other schools ====
The remainder of Saichō&#x27;s life was spent in heated debates with notable Hossō figures, particularly Tokuitsu, and maintaining an increasingly strained relationship with Kūkai (from whom he received esoteric initiations) to broaden his understanding of esoteric Buddhism. The debates with the Hossō school was primarily centered on the doctrine of the One Vehicle (&quot;ekayana&quot;) found in the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; which the Hossō school saw as not being an ultimate teaching. This was known as the &quot;San-Itsu Gon-Jitsu Ronsō&quot; (the debate over whether the One-vehicle or Three-vehicles, were the provisional or the real teaching) and it had a great influence on Japanese Buddhism.

Saichō also studied esoteric Buddhism under Kūkai, the founder of the Shingon school. Saichō borrowed esoteric texts from Kūkai for copying and they also exchanged letters for some time. However, they eventually had a falling out (in around 816) over their understanding of Buddhist esotericism. This was because Saichō attempted to integrate esoteric Buddhism (&quot;mikkyo&quot;) into his broader Tendai schema, seeing esoteric Buddhism as equal to the Tendai Lotus Sutra teaching. Saichō would write that Tendai and Mikkyo &quot;interfuse with one another&quot; and that &quot;there should be no such thing as preferring one to the other.&quot; Meanwhile, Kūkai saw mikkyo as different from and fully superior to &quot;kengyo&quot; (exoteric Buddhism) and was also concerned that Saichō had not finished his esoteric studies personally under him.

Saichō&#x27;s efforts were also devoted to developing a Mahāyāna ordination platform that required the Bodhisattva Precepts of the &quot;Brahmajala Sutra&quot; only, and not the pratimokṣa code of the Dharmaguptaka &quot;vinaya&quot;, which was traditionally used in East Asian Buddhist monasticism. Saichō saw the precepts of the small vehicle (&quot;hinayana&quot;) as no longer being necessary. His ideas were attacked by the more traditional Nara schools as well as the Sōgō (the Office of Monastic Affairs) and they were not initially approved by the imperial court. Saichō wrote the &quot;Kenkairon&quot; to respond to their criticisms. By the time that Saichō died in 822, his yearly petition was finally granted and the traditional &quot;Four Part Vinaya&quot; () was replaced by the Tendai Bodhisattva Precepts.

=== Development after Saichō ===


Seven days after Saichō died, the Imperial Court granted permission for the new Tendai Bodhisattva Precept ordination process which allowed Tendai to use an ordination platform separate from the powerful schools in Nara. Gishin, Saichō&#x27;s disciple and the first &quot;zasu&quot; , presided over the first allotted ordinands in 827. The appointments of the &quot;zasu&quot; typically only lasted a few years, and therefore among the same generation of disciples, a number could be appointed zasu in one&#x27;s lifetime. After Gishin, the next zasu of the Tendai school were: Enchō (円澄), Ennin 慈覺大師圓仁 (794–864), An&#x27;e (安慧), Enchin 智證大師圓珍 (814–891), Yuishu (惟首), Yūken (猷憲) and Kōsai (康済).

By 864, Tendai monks were now appointed to the powerful &quot;sōgō&quot; with the naming of An&#x27;e (安慧) as the provisional vinaya master. Other examples include Enchin&#x27;s appointment to the Office of Monastic Affairs in 883. While Saichō had opposed the Office during his lifetime, within a few generations disciples were now gifted with positions in the Office by the Imperial Family. By this time, Japanese Buddhism was dominated by the Tendai school to a much greater degree than Chinese Buddhism was by its forebear, the Tiantai.

=== Development of Tendai practice and esotericism ===
Philosophically, the Tendai school did not deviate substantially from the beliefs that had been created by the Tiantai school in China. However, Saichō had also transmitted numerous teachings from China was not exclusively Tiantai, but also included Zen (禪), Pure Land, the esoteric Mikkyō (密教), and Vinaya School (戒律) elements. The tendency to include a range of teachings became more marked in the doctrines of Saichō&#x27;s successors, such as Ennin, Enchin and Annen 安然 (841–?).

After Saichō, the Tendai order underwent efforts to deepen its understanding of teachings collected by the founder, particularly esoteric Buddhism. Saichō had only received initiation in the Diamond Realm Mandala, and since the rival Shingon school under Kūkai had received deeper training, early Tendai monks felt it necessary to return to China for further initiation and instruction. Saichō&#x27;s disciple Ennin went to China in 838 and returned ten years later with a more thorough understanding of esoteric, Pure Land, and Tiantai teachings. Ennin brought important esoteric texts and initiation lineages, such as the &quot;Susiddhikāra-sūtra,&quot; the &quot;Mahāvairocana-sūtra&quot; and &quot;Vajraśekhara-sūtra.&quot;

However, in later years, this range of teachings began to form sub-schools within Tendai Buddhism. By the time of Ryōgen, there were two distinct groups on Mt. Hiei, the Jimon and Sanmon: the Sammon-ha &quot;Mountain Group&quot; (山門派) followed Ennin and the Jimon-ha &quot;Temple Group&quot; (寺門派) followed Enchin.

Sōō 建立大師相應 (831–918), a student of Ennin, is another influential Tendai figure. He is known for developing the ascetic practice circumambulating Mt. Hiei, living and practicing in the remote wilderness. This practice, which became associated with Fudō Myōō (Acala) and Sōō&#x27;s hermitage at Mudō- ji, became quite influential in Tendai. A more elaborate and systematized practice based on Sōō&#x27;s simple mountain asceticism developed over time, and came to be called &quot;kaihōgyō&quot; (回峰行). This remains an important part of Tendai Buddhism today.

Akaku Daishi Annen 阿覺大師安然 (841–902?) is one of the most important post-Saichō Tendai thinkers. He wrote around a hundred works on Tendai doctrine and practice. According to Annen&#x27;s theory of the &quot;four ones&quot; (&quot;shiichi kyōhan&quot; 四一教判), all Buddhas are ultimately a single Buddha, all temporal moments are one moment, all Pure Lands are also just one Pure Land, and all teachings are interfused into one teaching.

According to Lucia Dolce, Annen &quot;systematized earlier and contemporary doctrines elaborated in both streams of Japanese esoteric Buddhism, Tōmitsu (i.e., Shingon) and Taimitsu (Tendai),&quot; &quot;critically reinterpreted Kūkai&#x27;s thought, offering new understandings of crucial esoteric concepts and rituals,&quot; and he also &quot;elaborated theories that were to become emblematic of Japanese Buddhism, such as the realization of buddhahood by grasses and trees (&quot;sōmoku jōbutsu&quot;)&quot; as well as &quot;hongaku shisō&quot; thought.

These various post-Saichō Tendai figures also developed the Tendai doctrine of &quot;the identity of the purport of Perfect and Esoteric teachings&quot; (&quot;enmitsu itchi&quot; 円密一致) which according to Ōkubo Ryōshun &quot;refers to the harmony and agreement between the Perfect teachings of the Lotus Sutra and Esoteric Buddhism.&quot;

Ryōgen 良源 (912–985) was the 18th abbot of the head temple Enryakuji at Mount Hiei. He was an influential politician closely tied to the Fujiwara clan as well as a scholar. Due to his influence, the Tendai school became the dominant Buddhist tradition in Japanese intellectual life and at the imperial court. Due to Ryōgen&#x27;s influence, Fujiwara family members also came to occupy important positions at Tendai temples. Ryōgen also established an army on Mt. Hiei to protect the Tendai school&#x27;s interests. Ryōgen is also known for this promotion of Pure Land nenbutsu recitation in his &quot;Gokuraku jōdo kuhon ōjōgi&quot; 極樂淨土九品往生義.

Genshin 惠心僧都源信 (942–1017), a student of Ryōgen, wrote the famous &quot;Ōjōyōshū&quot; 往生要集 (&quot;Essentials of Birth in the Pure Land&quot;), a treatise on Pure Land practice which influenced later Pure Land Japanese figures.

=== Medieval Japan (12th–16th century) ===

Although the Tendai sect flourished under the patronage of the Imperial House of Japan and the noble classes, by the end of the Heian period, it experienced an increasing breakdown in monastic discipline, plus political entanglements with rival factions of the Genpei War, namely the Taira and Minamoto clans. Due to its patronage and growing popularity among the upper classes, the Tendai sect became not only respected, but also politically and even militarily powerful, with major temples having vast landholdings and fielding their own monastic armies of sōhei (warrior-monks). This was not unusual for major temples at the time, as rival schools also fielded armies, such as the head temple of the Yogācāra school, Kōfuku-ji. With the outbreak of the Genpei War, Tendai temples even fought one another, such as Mount Hiei clashing with Mii-dera depending on their political affiliations.

In response to the perceived worldliness of the powerful Tendai school, a number of low-ranking Tendai monks became dissatisfied and sought to establish independent schools of their own. The major figures of &quot;New Kamakura Buddhism&quot; like Nichiren, Hōnen, Shinran, Eisai and Dōgen—all famous thinkers in non-Tendai schools of Japanese Buddhism—were all initially trained as Tendai monks. Tendai practices and monastic organization were adopted to some degree or another by each of these new schools, but one common feature of each school was a more narrowly-focused set of practices (e.g. daimoku for the Nichiren school, zazen for Zen, nembutsu for Pure Land schools, etc.) in contrast to the more integrated approach of the Tendai. In spite of the rise of these new competing schools which saw Tendai as being &quot;corrupt&quot;, medieval Tendai remained a &quot;a rich, varied, and thriving tradition&quot; during the medieval period according to Jacqueline Stone.

Although a number of breakaway schools rose during the Kamakura period, the Tendai school used its patronage to try to oppose the growth of these rival factions—particularly Nichiren Buddhism, which began to grow in power among the merchant middle class, and Pure Land Buddhism, which eventually came to claim the loyalty of many of the lower classes. Enryaku-ji, the temple complex on Mount Hiei, became a sprawling center of power, attended not only by ascetic monks, but also by brigades of sōhei (warrior monks) who fought in the temple&#x27;s interest. As a result, in 1571 Enryaku-ji was razed by Oda Nobunaga as part of his campaign to unify Japan. Nobunaga regarded the Mount Hiei monks as a potential threat or rival, as they could employ religious claims to attempt to rally the populace to their side. The temple complex was later rebuilt, and continues to serve as the head Tendai temple today.

Kamakura period Tendai also produced a number of important figures of its own, including Jien 慈圓 (1155–1225), known as a historian and a poet, who wrote the &quot;Gukanshō&quot; (a religious history of Japan) and numerous devotional poems. Other important figures include Shōshin 證眞 (fl. c. 1153–1214) and Shinsei 眞盛 (1443–1495).

Hōjibō Shōshin 寶地房證眞 (active 1153–1214) was a major Buddhist intellectual in medieval Japanese Buddhism and the head of the Tendai curriculum at Mount Hiei. Shōshin wrote numerous works and commentaries, and is most known for his commentaries on the writings of Zhiyi, the &quot;Personal Notes on the Three Major Works of Tendai&quot; (Tendai sandaibu shiki 天台三大部私記). This is &quot;the most detailed study on Tendai doctrine until the twentieth century,&quot; according to Matthew Don McMullen. Shōshin also wrote on esoteric Buddhism, which he interpreted in line with classical Tiantai doctrine, instead of seeing it as a separate form of Buddhism. Shōshin rejected the view that esoteric or mantrayana (&quot;shingon&quot;) Buddhism was superior to the Tendai Mahāyāna teaching of the one vehicle.

== Worldview ==
According to Jiko Hazama, the Tendai Buddhist worldview advocates a comprehensive form of Buddhism which sees all Buddhist teachings as being unified under an inclusive reading of the ekayāna teaching of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;. This holistic and inclusive form of Buddhism is based on the doctrinal synthesis of Tiantai Zhiyi, which was ultimately based on the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;.

Tendai Buddhism has several philosophical insights which allow for the reconciliation of Buddhist doctrine with aspects of Japanese culture such as Shinto and Japanese aesthetics. These include Zhiyi&#x27;s theory of perfect interfusion or unity of all phenomena (expressed in teachings like &quot;ichinen sanzen&quot; &quot;three thousand realms in one thought&quot;) and the Tendai theory of &quot;hongaku&quot; (original enlightenment) which holds that enlightenment is intrinsic in all things. Also central to Tendai thought is the notion that the phenomenal world, the world of our experiences, fundamentally is an expression of the Buddhist law (Dharma). This notion poses the problem of how we come to have many differentiated experiences. Tendai Buddhism claims that each and every sense phenomenon &quot;just as it is&quot; is the expression of Dharma.

In the major Tendai institutions like Taisho University and Mount Hiei, the main subjects of study are the Lotus Sutra, the works of the Tiantai Patriarch Zhiyi, the works of the founder Saichō and some later Tendai figures like Ennin.

=== The Lotus Sutra and Classic Tiantai Thought ===

The thought of the Japanese Tendai school is founded on the classic Chinese Tiantai doctrines found in the works of patriarch Zhìyǐ. These include:

* The One Vehicle of the Lotus Sutra,
* The Three Truths,
* The Three Samadhis,
* The Five Periods and Eight Teachings,
* The Four Siddhanta,
* &quot;Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought Moment&quot; (&quot;ichinen sanzen&quot; 一念三千).
Tendai Buddhism reveres the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; as the highest teaching in Buddhism. In Saichō&#x27;s writings, he frequently used the terminology &quot;hokke engyō&quot; to imply it was the culmination of the previous sermons given by Gautama Buddha. Because of the central importance of the Lotus Sutra, Tendai Buddhism sees all Buddhist teachings and practices as being united under the One Vehicle (ekayana) taught in the Lotus Sutra. Saichō frequently used the term &quot;ichijō bukkyō&quot; and referred to the second chapter of the Lotus Sutra as his main scriptural basis.

Saichō taught that there were &quot;three kinds of Lotus Sutra&quot;. According to Jacqueline Stone, these can be explained as follows:

* The Fundamental Lotus: &quot;the one vehicle which represents the Buddha&#x27;s single compassionate intent, underlying all his teachings, to lead all beings to buddhahood.&quot;
* The Hidden and Secret Lotus: &quot;those teachings in which, due to the immaturity of the Buddha&#x27;s audience, this intention is not outwardly revealed.&quot;
* The Lotus that was Preached Explicitly: The actual text of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;.

Stone writes that Saicho saw all Buddhist teachings as being the true &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; and he therefore attempted to integrate all Buddhist teachings he had studied within a single framework based on the Lotus Sutra&#x27;s One Vehicle.

Hazama Jikō writes that the central feature of Tendai thought is its advocacy of the &quot;One Great Perfect Teaching&quot; (一大円教), &quot;the idea that all the teachings of the Buddha are ultimately without contradiction and can be unified in one comprehensive and perfect system.&quot; This idea was used by Saichō as a basis for his integration of the various schools of Buddhism into a single comprehensive synthesis. Hazama writes that &quot;Saichō included both esoteric and exoteric teachings, and avoided an obsession with any one category of the Buddhist tradition such as Zen or the precepts. He sought instead to unite all of these elements on the basis of a single fundamental principle, the comprehensive and unifying ekayana spirit of the Lotus Sutra.&quot;

Saichō believed that by consolidating all Buddhist ideas and practices and including all the varieties of Buddhism, his new school would allow all to &quot;enter the great sea of Thusness which has a single flavor&quot; (真如一味の大海) by following the path of goodness and that this would protect the nation. According to Hazama Jikō &quot;these themes run throughout Saichō&#x27;s work&quot; including his &quot;Hokke shuku&quot; 法華秀 句 and &quot;Shugo kokkai sho&quot; 守護国界章.

Tendai thought also vigorously defends the idea that all beings have the potential for full buddhahood and thus that the Lotus Sutra was a teaching for all sentient beings. This teaching in particular was a major point of contention with the Japanese Hossō (Yogacara) school in Japan who espoused the which argues that not all being can become Buddhas, since some do not have the seeds for Buddhahood. The heated debates between Saichō and the Hossō scholar Tokuitsu frequently addressed this controversy as well as other related issues, such as how to categorize the various Buddhist teachings, and the value of certain Tendai teachings.

=== Doctrinal classification ===
Tendai thought also frames its understanding of Buddhist practice on the Lotus Sutra&#x27;s teaching of upāya or . Furthermore, Tendai uses a similar hierarchy as the one used in Chinese Tiantai to classify the various other sutras in the Buddhist canon in relation to the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, and it also follows Zhiyi&#x27;s original conception of Five Periods Eight Teachings or &quot;gojihakkyō&quot; . This is based on the doctrine of expedient means, but was also a common practice among East Asian schools trying to sort the vast corpus of writing inherited from India.

Annen provided a new doctrinal classification system (based on Zhiyi&#x27;s system) for Japanese Tendai. All Buddhist teachings are seen as being included into the following categories. The first major group are those teachings that rely on the three vehicles:

* The Tripiṭaka teachings (&quot;zō&quot; 藏), i.e. sravakayana or Hinayana
* The Common teaching to both Mahayana and non-Mahayana (&quot;tsū&quot; 通)
* The uniquely Mahayana teachings (&quot;betsu&quot; 別)

The highest teachings are those who derive from the one vehicle:

* The Perfect Tendai teaching, derived from the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, and the &quot;Avataṃsaka-sūtra&quot; (&quot;en&quot; 圓)
* The Esoteric teachings (&quot;mitsu&quot; 密)

=== Buddhahood with this very body ===
Another important doctrine in Japanese Tendai is that it is possible to attain &quot;Buddhahood with this very body&quot; (&quot;sokushin jōbutsu&quot;). This is closely related to the idea of original enlightenment. This idea was introduced by Saichō, who held that this described certain advanced practitioners who had realized the fifth degree of identity, though this attainment was a rare thing. Saichō understood the Lotus Sutra to be the &quot;great direct path&quot; to Buddhahood which could be attained in this very body. Saichō saw the story of the Dragon king&#x27;s daughter in the Lotus Sutra&#x27;s Devadatta chapter as evidence for this direct path (&quot;jikidō&quot;) to Buddhahood which did not require three incalculable eons (as was taught in some forms of Mahayana Buddhism), but could be achieved in three lives or even one lifetime.

Later Tendai scholars like Rinshō, and Annen were much more optimistic about the possibility of Buddhahood in this very body and claimed certain esoteric practices could lead to Buddhahood rapidly in only one lifetime, while de-emphasizing the concern with achieving Buddhahood in future lives. They also further extended the application of this idea to individuals at the lower bodhisattva levels of the degrees of identity schema and also argued that one could jump over bodhisattva stages. According to Groner, this allowed &quot;for the possibility that worldlings who still have some of the coarser defilements might experience sokushinjobutsu.&quot;

However, other Tendai figures like Hōjibō Shōshin (1136–1220 or 1131–1215), an important Tendai commentator on Zhiyi&#x27;s works, were more traditional and critical of ideas concerning the rapid realization of Buddhahood for everyone (without denying the possibility of Buddhahood in this body). For Shōshin, &quot;sokushin jōbutsu&quot; applied to those who had &quot;superior religious faculties&quot; because they &quot;have previously practiced the various provisional teachings&quot; in many previous lives.

=== Hongaku ===

The Tendai school was the locus of the development of the Japanese doctrine of &quot;hongaku&quot; 本覚 (innate or original enlightenment), which holds that all beings are enlightened inherently and which developed in Tendai from the cloistered rule era (1086–1185) through the Edo period (1688–1735). According to Jacqueline Stone, the term &quot;original enlightenment&quot; itself (Chn. &quot;pen-chileh&quot;) is first found in the &quot;Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana &quot;&quot;where it refers to true suchness considered under the aspect of conventional deluded consciousness and thus denotes the potential for enlightenment in unenlightened beings.&quot; The idea developed in the Chinese Huayen tradition and influenced Chan Buddhism, as well as the thought of Saichō and Kūkai.

Stone writes that the medieval Tendai doctrine regards &quot;enlightenment or the ideal state as inherent from the outset and as accessible in the present, rather than as the fruit of a long process of cultivation.&quot; Scholars also refer to the doctrinal system associated with this idea as &quot;original enlightenment thought&quot;. Stone defines this as the &quot;array of doctrines and concepts associated with the proposition that all beings are enlightened inherently.&quot; According to Stone, as these teachings developed, they grew to include the idea that:Not only human beings, but ants and crickets, mountains and rivers, grasses and trees are all innately Buddhas. The Buddhas who appear in sutras, radiating light and endowed with excellent marks, are merely provisional signs. The &quot;real&quot; Buddha is the ordinary worldling. Indeed, the whole phenomenal world is the primordially enlightened Tathāgata.Tamura Yoshirō argued that hongaku was a non-dual teaching which saw all existents as interpenetrating and mutually identified. This negates any ontological difference between Buddhas and common people as well as between pure lands and mundane worlds. Tamura argued that this move re-affirms the relative phenomenal world as an expression of the ultimate nondual reality and is found in phrases like &quot;the worldly passions are precisely enlightenment&quot; and &quot;birth and death are precisely nirvana&quot;. These lineages also transmitted their teachings through transmission rituals which made use of mirrors to illustrate nonduality and the interpenetration of all phenomena.

Hongaku teachings were passed down through various exoteric teaching lineages (which often involved secrecy), the largest of which were the Eshin-ryu and the Danna-ryu. At the core of these doctrinal systems was the Tendai practice of the &quot;threefold contemplation in a single thought&quot; (isshin sangan 一心 三観) which is taught in Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;Mohezhiguan&quot;. According to Stone, this practice is based on seeing &quot;that all phenomena are empty of substance, provisionally existing, and the middle, or both empty and provisionally existing simultaneously.&quot;

While certain scholars have seen hongaku thought as denying the need for Buddhist practice, Stone notes that Tendai hongaku based texts like the &quot;Shinnyokan&quot; 真 如 観 (Contemplation of true suchness) and the &quot;Shuzenji-ketsu&quot; 修 禅 守 伏 (Decisions of Hsiuch’an-ssu) deny this idea. Instead, these texts teach various kinds of Buddhist practices, including nenbutsu, contemplation of emptiness (kukan 空観), meditations using Buddhist icons and mirrors, practicing the threefold contemplation in the midst of daily activities and recitation of the daimoku during when one is approaching death.

Hongaku thought was also influential on the development of New Kamakura Buddhism and the founders of these schools, though they had their own unique understandings. However, not all Tendai thinkers embraced hongaku thought. For example, the more conservative commentator Hōjibō Shōshin criticized hongaku ideas as a denial of causality.

== Practice ==
=== Tendai Practice Theory ===
A feature unique to Japanese Tendai Buddhism from its inception was the concept of &quot;shishūyūgō&quot; . Senior Tendai teachers, or ajari, train in all four practice traditions.

Under the umbrella of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, Tendai integrates four main aspects of Mahayana Buddhist practice:
* Pure Land practices, especially the recitation of the Buddha&#x27;s name (&quot;nembutsu&quot;), such as the name of Amitabha
* &quot;Śamatha-vipaśyanā&quot; meditation (Jp. &quot;shikan&quot; 止観, &quot;calming-insight&quot; meditation). The main source for this in Tendai is Zhiyi&#x27;s &quot;Móhē zhǐguān&quot;.
* Esoteric practices which make use of mantras, mudras and mandalas, also known as &quot;taimitsu&quot; 台密.
* Precepts, in particular the Bodhisattva Precepts.

According to Saichō and other later Tendai scholars, the Perfect teaching of the Lotus Sutra and the tantric doctrines and practices of Esoteric Buddhism had the same ultimate intent. This view of the equality and compatibility between the Tiantai Lotus teachings and Esoteric Buddhism was important for Saichō. Unlike the Shingon founder Kūkai, Saichō did not see esoteric teachings as more powerful or superior to exoteric Tendai teaching and practice. Instead, Saichō held that all Buddhist teachings are included in the single intent of the Lotus Sutra&#x27;s teaching. This idea is reflected in the saying &quot;Shingon (esoteric Buddhism) and (Tien-tai) shikan are essentially one; therefore both traditions are propagated on one mountain&quot; (from Shōshin&#x27;s &quot;Tendai Shingon nishii doi sho&quot;).

Certain later Tendai figures like Ennin also argued that esoteric practices led to Buddhahood faster than exoteric (non-esoteric) practices and some (such as Annen) argued that they were the &quot;only&quot; way to full Buddhahood. These figures also often saw the Lotus Sutra (which refers itself as &quot;the secret essential of the buddhas&quot; and &quot;the secret treasure of the Tathagatha&quot;) as an esoteric text and this view has some precedent in the Chinese Tiantai tradition.

However, other more conservative figures like Hōjibō Shōshin rejected the idea that esoteric Buddhism is higher or superior to Tendai Mahayana practice, since both of these traditions are ultimately founded on the middle way and both teach the contemplation of the emptiness of dharmas. Shōshin held that mantras and other esoteric practices were merely another skillful means for contemplating the middle way and are thus different expressions of the same principle. He also argued that these teachings both derive from the same Buddha, since Mahāvairocana and the Buddha of the Lotus Sūtra are ultimately the same. In some cases, Shōshin goes further, arguing that certain esoteric practices, such as those that make use of images like mandalas or lunar discs, were designed for those with dull faculties, while the Tendai practice of &quot;discerning one&#x27;s own mind&quot; (Jp. &quot;kanjin&quot;, 觀心) is for those who are more advanced and do not require images.

===Pure Land practice===

Practices related to and veneration of Amitābha and his pure land of Sukhavati in the Tendai tradition began with Saichō&#x27;s disciple, Ennin. After journeying to China for further study and training, he brought back a practice called the &quot;five-tone &quot;nembutsu&quot;&quot; or , which was a form of intonation practiced in China for reciting the Buddha&#x27;s name. This contrasted with earlier practices in Japan starting in the Nara period, where meditation on images of the Pure Land, typically in the form of mandala, were practiced.

However, both meditation on the Pure Land (&quot;kansō nenbutsu&quot; 観想念仏) and recitation of the Buddha&#x27;s name (&quot;shōmyō nenbutsu&quot; 称名念仏) became an integral part of Pure Land practices in the Tendai tradition. In addition to the five-tone &quot;nembutsu&quot; brought back from China, Ennin also integrated a special monastic training program called the originally promulgated by Zhiyi. In this practice, monks spend 90 days in retreat, circumambulating a statue of Amitābha constantly reciting his name.

In addition to increasing monastic practices related to the Pure Land, monks also taught Pure Land practices to the lay community in the form of reciting the Buddha&#x27;s name. The most famous of these was a monk named Kūya (空也, 903–972).

Pure Land Buddhist thought was further developed by a Tendai monk named Genshin (源信, 942–1017) who was a disciple of Ryōgen, the 18th chief abbot or &quot;zasu&quot; (座主) of Mount Hiei. Genshin wrote an influential treatise called , which vividly contrasted the Sukhavati Pure Land of Amitābha with the descriptions of the hell realms in Buddhism. Further, Genshin promoted the popular notion of the Latter Age of the Dharma, which posited that society had degenerated to a point when they could no longer rely on traditional Buddhist practices, and would instead need to rely solely on Amitābha&#x27;s grace to escape saṃsāra. Genshin drew upon past Chinese Pure Land teachers such as Daochuo and Shandao.

Finally, Pure Land practices in Tendai were further popularized by former Tendai monk Hōnen, who established the first independent Pure Land school, the Jōdo-shū, and whose disciples carried the teachings to remote provinces in one form or another. This includes another ex-Tendai monk named Shinran, who eventually established the related Jōdo Shinshū.

=== Tendai Esotericism (&quot;Taimitsu&quot;) ===

One of the adaptations by the Tendai school was the introduction of esoteric Buddhist practice into Tendai Buddhism. This was originally known as &quot;the &quot;shingon&quot; (or &quot;mikkyō&quot;) of the Tendai lineages&quot; and was later named &quot;Taimitsu&quot; &quot;Tendai Esotericism&quot; (台密), distinguishing it from the Shingon (Mantra) school, which is known as &quot;Tōmitsu&quot; (東密, literally, &quot;the esotericism of the Tōji lineages&quot;).

Taimitsu claims that through the chanting of mantras, maintaining mudras, and performing certain meditations using mandalas (known as &quot;the three mysteries&quot;), one is able to see that the sense experiences are the teachings of Buddha, have faith that they are inherently an enlightened being, and can attain Buddhahood within this very body. Eventually, these esoteric rituals came to be considered of equal importance with the teachings of the &quot;Lotus Sutra,&quot; which was also seen as an esoteric sutra (but only &quot;in principle&quot;, not &quot;in practice&quot;, since it did not include the practice of the three mysteries).

The origins of Taimitsu are found in Chinese Esoteric Buddhism similar to the lineage of Kūkai, and Saichō&#x27;s disciples were encouraged to study under him. As a result, Tendai esoteric ritual bears much in common with Shingon, though the underlying doctrines differ. Regarding textual basis, while Shingon mainly uses the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot; and the &quot;Vajrasekhara Sutra&quot; (seeing these as the highest and most superior texts), Tendai uses a larger corpus of texts to understand and practice esoteric Buddhism. Other differences mainly relate to lineages and outlook. There are several lineages of Taimitsu, the main ones being the Sanmon 山門 (Mountain branch of Ennin&#x27;s lineage, which has a further 13 sub-branches) and Jimon 寺門 (Temple branch of Enchin&#x27;s lineage, which is more unified).

Some Taimitsu scholars, like Ennin, classify esoteric scriptures into two classes: those containing the principles of esoteric Buddhism (i.e. the non-duality of ultimate truth and worldly truth) were called &quot;rimitsu&quot; and those that teach the principles &quot;and&quot; practices (i.e. the three mysteries) were called &quot;riji gumitsu&quot;. The first category was said to include the &quot;Nirvana, Lotus, Vimalakīrti&quot;, and &quot;Huayan&quot; sūtras, all of which were seen as esoteric in principle. The second category includes the tantric scriptures like the &quot;Mahavairocana&quot;, &quot;Vajrasekhara,&quot; the &quot;Susiddhikāra Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Soshitsujikara&quot;), the &quot;Pudichang jing&quot; 菩提場経 (&quot;Bodaijō kyō&quot;, T. 950), and the &quot;Yuqi jing&quot; 瑜祇経 (&quot;Yugi kyō&quot;, T. 867). Later scholars like Annen further elevated the esoteric scriptures, seeing them as the highest teachings of the Buddha. According to Lucia Dolce, later Taimitsu thinkers like Annen, &quot;displaced other practices existent in Tendai as soteriologically incomplete practices. Rather than following continental understandings of ritual forms as skillful means to achieve enlightenment (&quot;usō hōben&quot; 有相方便), they gave them ontological weight by deeming them to be the embodiment of the ultimate truth.&quot;

=== Bodhisattva precepts ===

The Tendai school&#x27;s ethical teachings focus exclusively on the Bodhisattva Precepts (C. &quot;pusajie&quot;, J. &quot;bostasukai&quot; 菩薩戒) drawn from the &quot;Brahmajala Sutra.&quot; Tendai ordinations do not make use of the traditional Dharmaguptaka Vinaya Pratimoksha set of monastic rules. Saichō argued in favor of this idea in his &quot;Kenkairon&quot; (顕戒論, &quot;On promoting the Mahāyāna precepts&quot;). This was a revolutionary change in East Asian Buddhism that was without precedent. These bodhisattva precepts do not make a distinction between monastics and laypersons, and they do not discuss the minutiae of monastic life like the Pratimoksha does.

The bodhisattva precepts in Tendai are all said to rely on three types of &quot;pure precepts&quot; (&quot;sanjujokai&quot; 三聚浄戒):

* Precepts against doing evil deeds, such as murder, theft, pride, anger, and so forth (&quot;sho ritsugi kai&quot; 摂律 儀 戒)
* Precepts encouraging good activity, for benefiting oneself (&quot;sho zenbo kai&quot; 摂菩法戒)
* Precepts encouraging activity which will benefit others (&quot;sho shujo kai&quot; 摂衆生戒)

According to Hazama Jikō:The first category includes the prohibitions against the ten major and forty-eight minor transgressions as explained in the &quot;Bonmokyo&quot; 梵辋経 (T24, 997–1010). It also includes general restrictions against any kind of evil activity, whether physical, verbal, or mental. Any and all kinds of moral cultivation are included. The second category entails every kind of good activity, including but not limited to acts associated with the Buddhist categories of keeping precepts, the practice of concentration (samadhi), and the cultivation of wisdom. Also included are such worldly pursuits as dedication to scholarly excellence, or any effort aimed at self improvement. The third category refers not only to the effort to help and save all sentient beings through the perfection of the six Mahayana virtues (paramita, charity, morality, patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom), but also includes such mundane activity as raising one&#x27;s children with loving care, living for the sake of others, and dedicating oneself to the good of society.The Tendai school made extensive use of the Lotus Sutra in its interpretation of the bodhisattva precepts, even though the sutra does not itself contains a specific list of precepts. Also, various passages from the sutra were used to defend the Tendai position not to follow the pratimoksha, since they state, for example, &quot;we will not follow śrāvaka ways.&quot;

The bodhisattva precepts were seen as being based on the &quot;Lotus Sutr&quot;a&#x27;s teaching that all beings have the potential for Buddhahood and that they have a fundamental goodness, or Buddha-nature. This was the fundamental ethical teaching for Tendai thought. Saichō believed that the world had entered the age of Dharma decline (&quot;mappō&quot;) and that because of this, the Hinayana precepts were no longer able to be practiced and no longer needed. He also believed that the Japanese people were naturally inclined to the Mahayana Buddhism. Because of this, Saichō argued that only Mahayana precepts were needed.

=== Zen ===
Saichō also received Chan (Zen) teachings in China from the Oxhead (Jp. Gozu) school and Northern schools integrated them into his Tendai system. He was a student of the Oxhead master Shunian (Shukunen), who resided at Chanlinsi (Zenrinji) Temple. Saichō brought over the first copy of the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot; to Japan.

Some of the views of Saichō regarding the Mahayana precepts were drawn from the Tiantai masters Huisi and Daosui and the teachings Chan masters like Bodhidharma, Dao-xuan (Dōsen, especially his commentary on the Brahmā&#x27;s Net Sūtra) and Daoxin (Dōshin&quot;,&quot; particularly his &quot;Manual of Rules of Bodhisattva Precepts&quot;). These Chinese Chan masters emphasized formless practice (無相行) or attribute-less practice also known as &quot;anrakugyō&quot; (Ch. anlexing 安樂行, serene and pleasing activities), both in Chan meditation and in precept training. This refers to a way of contemplation that applies in all activities. These various Chinese ideas about the integration of practice and precepts were integrated into Saichō&#x27;s view of the &quot;Perfect and Sudden Precepts&quot; (&quot;Endonkai&quot;).

=== Tendai and Shinto ===
 Tendai doctrine allowed Japanese Buddhists to reconcile Buddhist teachings with the native religious beliefs and practices of Japan (now labeled &quot;Shinto&quot;). In the case of Shinto, the difficulty is the reconciliation of the pantheon of Japanese gods (&quot;kami&quot;), as well as with the myriad spirits associated with places, shrines or objects, with Buddhist teachings. These gods and spirits were initially seen as local protectors of Buddhism.

Sannō Shintō 山王神道 was a specifically Tendai branch of syncretic Buddhist-Shinto religious practice, which revered kamis called the Mountain Kings (Sannō) or Sanno Sansei 山王三聖 (The Three Sacred [Deities] of Sanno) and was based on Hie Taisha 日吉大社 a shrine on Mount Hiei. The Togakushi Shrine (戸隠神社, &quot;Togakushi Jinja&quot;) was also associated with the Tendai school before it was separated from Buddhist institutions by the Japanese state during the separation of Shinto from Buddhism in the 19th century.

These religious ideas eventually led to the development of a Japanese current of thought called &quot;honji suijaku&quot; (本地垂迹), which argued that kami are simply local manifestations (the &quot;suijaku&quot; or &quot;traces&quot;) of the Buddhas (&quot;honji,&quot; &quot;true nature&quot;). This manifestation of the Buddhas was explained through the classic Mahayana doctrines of skillful means and the Trikaya.

=== Shugendō ===
Some Tendai Buddhist temples and mountains are also sites for the practice of the syncretic Shugendō tradition. Shugendō is a mountain ascetic practice which also adopted Tendai and Shingon elements. This tradition focuses on ascetic practices on mountainous terrain. The practice of Shugendō is most prominent among certain Tendai branches, like the Jimon-ha 寺門派 (the Onjōji branch). It is based on Shōgoin Temple, which houses the Honzan group (Honzanha), the Shugendō tradition most closely associated with Tendai.

=== Art and aesthetics ===

The classic Buddhist understanding of the Four Noble Truths posits that craving for pleasure, worldly desire and attachment must be cut off to put an end to suffering (&quot;dukkha&quot;). In early Buddhism, the emphasis, especially for monastics, was on avoiding activities that might arouse worldly desires, including many artistic endeavors like music and performance arts. This tendency toward rejecting certain popular art forms created a potential conflict with mainstream East Asian cultures.

However, later Mahayana views developed a different emphasis which embraced all the arts. In Japan, certain Buddhist rituals (which were also performed in Tendai) grew to include music and dance, and these became very popular with the people. Doctrinally, these performative arts were seen as skillful means (&quot;hōben&quot;, Skt. &quot;upaya&quot;) of teaching Buddhism. Monks specializing in such arts were called &quot;yūsō&quot; (&quot;artistic monks&quot;). The writing of religious poetry was also a major pursuit among certain Tendai as well as Shingon figures, like the Shingon priest Shukaku and the Tendai monk Jien (1155–1225). These poets met together to discuss poetry in poetry circles (&quot;kadan&quot;). According to Deal and Ruppert, &quot;Shingon, Tendai and Nara cloisters had a great impact on the development of literary treatises and poetry houses.&quot;

Another influential poet monk from the Tendai tradition was Fujiwara no Shunzei (1114–1204). His son, Fujiwara no Teika was also influenced by the classic Tendai thought of Zhiyi. These two figures were central to the development of the aesthetic concept of &quot;yūgen&quot; (幽玄, profound grace and subtlety). According to William R. LaFleur, the development of &quot;yūgen&quot; aesthetic theory was also influenced by the Tendai practice of &quot;shikan&quot; meditation. According to LaFleur, for Shunzei&#x27;s poetics, the beauty of &quot;yūgen&quot; manifests a deep tranquility which reflects and is akin to &quot;shikan&quot; practice. This link is asserted by Shunzei in his &quot;Kurai futeisho.&quot; These poets also understood the depth of &quot;yūgen&quot; through the holistic Tendai metaphysics of interfusion&quot;.&quot;

== Notable Tendai scholars ==

In the history of Tendai school, a number of notable monks have contributed to Tendai thought and administration of Mt. Hiei:
* Saichō – Founder.
* Gishin – Second of the Tendai School, who travelled with Saicho to China and ordained alongside him.
* Ennin – Saicho&#x27;s successor, the first to try to merge esoteric practices with exoteric Tendai School theories (this merger is now known as &quot;Taimitsu&quot;), as well as promote nianfo.
* Enchin – Gishin successor, junior to Ennin. The first to successfully assimilate esoteric buddhism to Tendai, and a notable administrator as well.
* Annen - Henjō (Ennin&#x27;s disciple)&#x27;s successor, junior to Enchin. An influential thinker who&#x27;s known having finalized the assimilation of esoteric and exoteric buddhism within Tendai.
* Ryōgen – Annen&#x27;s successor, and skilled politician who helped ally the Tendai School with the Fujiwara clan.
* Toba Sōjō (1053–1140) – the 48th zasu and a satirical artist. Sometimes he is credited as the author of &quot;Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga&quot;, one of the earliest manga, but this attribution is highly disputed.
* Sengaku (1203 – c. 1273) – a Tendai scholar and literary critic, who authored an influential commentary on the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū&quot;, the oldest extant Japanese poetry.

<text>Sequana Capital was a French pulp and paper company.

==History==
The company was founded as a coal importing business known as Worms and Cie in 1848. After diversifying into banking and finance it acquired Arjo Wiggins, a paper manufacturing business, in 2000. The founding Worms family stood down from the board in 2004 and it was renamed Sequana Capital in 2005. Following a protracted dispute with British American Tobacco over the payment of dividends, it was placed in liquidation in 2019.

<text>University of Northwestern – St. Paul (UNW) is a private evangelical Christian university in Roseville, Minnesota.

== History ==
The predecessor to the current university was first established in 1902 as the Northwestern Bible and Missionary Training School by William Bell Riley, a pastor at First Baptist Church of Minneapolis. In 1935, the school opened the Northwestern Evangelical Seminary. The College of Liberal Arts was added in 1944. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the three schools were commonly known together as The Northwestern Schools.

In 1951, the Bible school was rebranded as a Bible college and offered baccalaureate degrees alongside the college of liberal arts. In 1956, the seminary was closed, and the Bible college was subsumed into liberal arts college, renaming it Northwestern College. The school closed from 1966 to 1972 after failing to earn accreditation from the North Central Association, although it was eventually able to reopen after the purchase of the former Nazareth Hall Preparatory Seminary from the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis and the sale of its former campus in Loring Park. Accreditation was finally received in 1978. In 2013, Northwestern College was reorganized as a university under the current name University of Northwestern – St. Paul.

UNW also owns a chain of radio stations across the Midwest and Eastern United States, broadcasting listener-supported Christian music and teaching programs. Noted evangelist Billy Graham served as the school&#x27;s second president from 1948 to 1952.

The university was granted an exemption to Title IX in 2016 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons. Although being an LGBT person does not in itself preclude admission to the university, the admitted student is still expected to abide by the Declaration of Christian Community (DOCC) that all students are required to sign, which includes provisions against homosexual behavior or relationships.

<text>Boise Cascade Company is an American manufacturer of wood products and wholesale distributor of building materials, headquartered in Boise, Idaho.

 with sales over $7.9 billion in 2021, it is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol BCC. Boise Cascade Wood Products manufactures plywood, engineered wood products and lumber; it supplies a broad line of wood products and building materials through Boise Cascade Building Materials Distribution&#x27;s 38 distribution locations.

The company has approximately 6,000 employees across North America. Its logo, designed in the 1960s, depicts a pine tree inside the containing circle.

The company is neither affiliated with the Canadian paper company Cascades nor is there any connection to Boise, Inc. or Boise Paper, a division of Packaging Corporation of America.

== History ==
Boise Cascade Corporation was formed in 1957 through the merger of Cascade Lumber Company of Yakima, Washington, and Boise Payette Lumber Company Robert Hansberger of Boise Payette became the CEO, and the new corporation focused on ownership and management of timberlands, the growing and harvesting of timber, and the manufacturing and distribution of lumber products and building materials. By late 1958, the company had established more than 100 retail outlets for its wholesale distribution business. That same year, BC&#x27;s first paper mill became operational in Wallula, to produce corrugated shipping containers.

The 1960s saw the company&#x27;s swift expansion into the forest products industry, as well as wide variety of other businesses. Boise Cascade owned concrete ready-mix plants, plastic manufacturing plants, textiles, and sand and gravel companies. In 1964, the company entered office products distribution. The mid-1960s brought an even more diverse portfolio including ownership of a motor home manufacturer, a cruise line, involvement in real estate and recreation projects, and an acquisition in the engineering and construction business for major utilities. Boise native William Agee joined the company in 1964 and was the chief financial officer from 1969 the stock price rapidly rose to $77 in 1969, but was down to $15 by the fall 

Boise Cascade&#x27;s current headquarters in Boise was built in 1970, designed by architecture firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. With the share price at around eleven dollars, Hansberger resigned in John Fery was promoted to CEO and moved the company back to its core competencies of building materials and As the 1980s progressed, a decline in the housing market led to a downsizing in building products distribution business, and by 1987, all retail outlets had been sold or closed.

In the early 1990s, the company sold the wholesale portion of its office products distribution business while keeping the consumer business. In the 1990s, Boise Cascade invested in engineered wood products, building mills in White City, Oregon, and in Alexandria, Louisiana, for producing laminated veneer lumber (LVL). Boise Cascade introduced the finger-jointing technique for manufacturing LVL that remains unique to the EWP industry today. After leading the company for 22 years, Fery retired and George Harad was named CEO. During his tenure, the company focused on expanding its activity in distribution and reducing its presence in manufacturing. In 1999, Furman Lumber of Billerica, Massachusetts, was purchased, which led to a nationwide building material wholesale distribution system for Boise Cascade.

The next decade continued to bring big changes. In 2003, the company acquired OfficeMax. In 2004, Madison Dearborn Capital Partners purchased the paper, forest products and timberland assets and created a privately owned company called Boise Cascade LLC. Remaining portion of the company changed its name to OfficeMax and traded with ticker OMX. When Tom Stephens began as CEO of Boise Cascade, LLC in 2004, the company had incurred $3.2 billion in debt to fund the acquisition. The company&#x27;s 1.6 million acres of timberlands were sold in 2005 to help pay down that debt. Three years later, a publicly traded shell company bought the pulp and paper operations and became Boise, Inc., allowing Boise Cascade to pay off most of the remaining debt. The timing was fortuitous when, in 2008, the housing market collapsed and tough times ensued for the entire industry. Tom Carlile assumed the position of CEO in 2009, and began to lead the company through the slow housing recovery with investments in EWP and veneer facilities and the building materials distribution footprint. By late 2012, the company prepared to launch an IPO, which was completed on February 6, 2013, when it rang the bell at the NYSE.

Tom Corrick was named CEO in 2015 and retired March 6, 2020. Nate Jorgensen is the current CEO.

==Operations==
The company operates through two vertically integrated divisions:

* The Wood Products division manufactures engineered wood products (EWP), plywood and lumber for wholesalers, retail dealers and builders to meet residential and commercial construction needs. The division has manufacturing facilities are located in the Pacific Northwest and southeastern U.S., and one mill in Canada at St. Jacques, New Brunswick. BC owns and operates the world&#x27;s two largest laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and I-joist manufacturing plants, and is the #2 producer of engineered wood products and #2 producer of plywood in North America.
* The Building Materials Distribution division stocks an extensive inventory of structural building products used from the foundation to the roof, including engineered wood, siding, composite decking, metal, insulation and more from over 1,100 third-party suppliers. The division delivers orders by truck and rail to home improvement centers, retail lumber dealers, and industrial customers. There are 35 distribution branches nationwide, making it the largest wholesale building products distributor in the U.S.

==Corporate governance==
Boise Cascade&#x27;s executive leadership includes CEO Nate Jorgensen, Kelly Hibbs (CFO, SVP and Treasurer), Mike Brown (EVP, Wood Products) and Jeff Strom (EVP, Building Materials Distribution). The company&#x27;s board of directors is currently led by Chairman Tom Carlile, former CEO and CFO of Boise Cascade.

After over-extending into non-traditional areas under CEO Hansberger and young the company nearly went into liquidation in 1972. A management team under new CEO Fery got the company back to basics through the rest of 

After the purchase of OfficeMax in 2003, Boise Cascade separated its distribution and manufacturing businesses the following The pulp and paper assets of Boise Cascade L.L.C. were sold to an investment firm in 2008, then acquired by Packaging Corporation of America in 2013 and became its Boise Paper division. Boise had entered the paper side of the forest products industry in 1958 with a new mill in treeless

<text>Intel&#x27;s i486 OverDrive processors are a category of various Intel i486s that were produced with the designated purpose of being used to upgrade personal computers. The OverDrives typically possessed qualities different from &#x27;standard&#x27; i486s with the same speed steppings. Those included built-in voltage regulators, different pin-outs, write-back cache instead of write-through cache, built-in heatsinks, and fanless operation — features that made them more able to work where an ordinary edition of a particular model would not.

It is based on the Intel486 DX2 microprocessor technology. Each 486 Overdrive typically came in two versions, ODP and ODPR variants. The ODPR chips had 168 pins and functioned as complete swap-out replacements for existing chips, whereas the ODP chips had an extra 169th pin, and were used for inserting into a special &#x27;Overdrive&#x27; (PGA 169) socket on some i486 boards, which would disable the existing CPU without needing to remove it (in case that the existing CPU is surface-mounted). ODP chips will not work in Pre-Socket 1 486 boards due to the extra pin. The ODP and ODPR labeling can be found in the CPU&#x27;s model number(i.e.: DX2ODPR66).

==Models==
Models available included:
* 20 MHz FSB, 40 MHz clock speed. This version of the 20-MHz Overdrive (ODP) was available for the 16- and 20-MHz Intel486 SX CPU for USD $549.
* 25 MHz FSB, 50 MHz clock speed. The 25-MHz OverDrive (ODP) version was available for USD $699.
* 33 MHz FSB, 66 MHz clock speed
* 25 MHz FSB, 75 MHz clock speed
* 33 MHz FSB, 100 MHz clock speed

Two P54 core Pentium-based CPUs were released for PGA 238 Socket 2/Socket 3-based systems, for more information, see Pentium OverDrive

<doc id="293503" wikidata="Q1424874" url="?curid=293503" title="Gyokuro">
<text>is a type of green tea from Japan. It differs from the standard &quot;sencha&quot; (a classic green tea grown in the sun) in being grown under the shade rather than the full sun. The name &quot;gyokuro&quot; translates as &quot;jewel dew&quot; (or &quot;jade dew&quot;). According to the Japan Tea Central Association, gyokuro is defined as &quot;a tea manufactured in the same manner as sencha from tea leaves picked from covered tea gardens that are almost completely shaded from sunlight for about 20 days using covering materials such as reed screens, straw, or shading nets, from the time when the new shoots of the first flush start to grow.&quot;

While most sencha is from the cultivar of &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;, gyokuro is often made from a specialized variety such as Asahi, Okumidori, Yamakai, and Saemidori. Most gyokuro is grown in the Fukuoka, Kyoto, and Mie prefectures.

Gyokuro tea production dates back to the 1830s, when the merchant Yamamoto Kahei discovered some Japanese farmers were covering tea plants with a netting to protect them from frost, and that this actually changed the flavor and aroma of the tea. He introduced the tea to Edo and it was immediately popular.

== Cultivation and processing ==

Though it is categorized as a type of sencha according to production methods, gyokuro cultivation differs from other sencha teas. Gyokuro tea leaves are shielded from the sun before being harvested. The period can vary from twenty to thirty days. Three weeks / twenty days is a standard length of time for a tea to be considered gyokuro proper. Anything shaded for under twenty days is considered kabuse tea. 

The shading causes both the amino acid L-theanine and the alkaloid caffeine in the tea leaves to increase, and the catechins and tannins to decrease, which yields significant differences from the flavor of sencha. The shading causes the plant to stop converting theanine into catechins to protect itself from UV light. Furthermore, the stress of shading also makes the plant produce more caffeine to protect itself. Gyokuro also has higher chlorophyll content, which accounts for the dark green color of the leaves. These chemical differences lead to unique flavor and aroma of the tea, giving it more umami, a savory sweetness, and less bitterness and astringency. The increased L-theanine content elicits the increased umami taste of gyokuro. It also produces a calming effect which balances out the high caffeine content of gyokuro. Studies on L-theanine indicate that it may also help reduce stress and anxiety and may have neuroprotective effects. 

The length and type of shading or covering (kabuse) will affect the taste of the gyokuro tea. Shading may be done with a scaffolding built over the tea field or by covering the plants directly with the shading material (jikagise). The opacity of the shading material (which can be synthetic, straw, or reed) will also affect how much theanine is contained in the leaves, which affects the flavor, particularly umami. The process is often done in stages, initially blocking 70% of the sunlight, and ramping up to 80 and 90 percent before harvesting. The higher grades of gyokuro are shaded more extensively and for longer times. 

The processing of the picked gyokuro leaves will also affect the aroma and taste of the tea. Like standard sencha, gyokuro is steamed after harvesting, usually in industrial machinery. The length of the steaming can be short (asamushi), middling (chumushi), or long (fukamushi, 1-2 minutes). This will also affect the aroma and flavor of the tea. After steaming, the leaves are then dried and rolled, traditionally by hand, but now it is common to use industrial machinery to roll the leaves. 
If the leaves were harvested mechanically, the stems and other parts of the plant must be separated out from the leaves. Hand picked gyokuro exists, but it commands higher prices. 

The stems, stalks, twigs and other by-products of gyokuro processing may be used to make a higher end kukicha (twig tea), which is called &quot;karigane&quot; or &quot;shiraore&quot; when processed from gyokuro stems and parts. These parts have a high concentration of theanine due to their lower photosynthetic activity compared to the leaves, have less caffeine, and also contain different aromatic and flavorful compounds, making their flavor distinct from standard gyokuro. A rough unprocessed mix of gyokuro leaves, broken particles, stalks and stems, is also sold separately as unprocessed tea / unrefined tea (aracha). These rougher types of gyokuro tend to be less expensive than standard leaf only gyokuro.

==Brewing==
Brewing gyokuro is generally done with lower temperature water (between 40 to 70 celsius; 104 to 158 fahrenheit depending on the leaf and personal preference). The traditional Japanese method of brewing gyokuro uses a high water to leaf ratio, usually around 5 grams of leaves for 150 millileters of water. Since the leaves are tightly rolled and need time to open, the steeping time is usually longer than other green teas (2 minutes). After the leaves have opened, the same gyokuro can then be re-steeped three or four more times for 20-30 seconds.

In the practice of &quot;Senchadō&quot; (the way of sencha), many schools use a &quot;two-step brewing&quot; method. First, low-temperature water, cooled by initially pouring it into a separate cooling vessel, is used to extract sweetness. Then, high-temperature water is used to extract bitterness. There are also schools that add a &quot;three-step brewing&quot; method, which use water of intermediate temperature for the second infusion to extract astringency. However, due to the increased time required for each session and the fact that the components may be almost fully extracted by the second infusion for some tea leaves, the &quot;two-step brewing&quot; method is more prevalent at large tea gatherings. Small teapots such as koburi or houhin (small teapots without a handle) are often used, and the tea bowls are also smaller compared to those used for sencha.

== Regions and market ==
More than 40% of gyokuro is produced in Yame (Fukuoka Prefecture), and in the national tea jury in August 2007, Yamecha (Yame tea) held all the ranking positions from first to 26th as the best gyokuro. A high amount of Ujicha gyokuro is also produced around Uji, in the Kyoto prefecture (140 tons in 2008). In 2008, the production volume of gyokuro in Mie Prefecture increased more than 40 times compared to the previous year (132 tons in 2008, 3 tons in 2007). 

Gyokuro is one of the most expensive types of sencha available in Japan. The name was originally the product name of the tea made by Yamamotoyama. The tea was first discovered by Yamamotoyama&#x27;s sixth owner, Yamamoto Kahei, in 1835 (Tenpō year 6). The process was completed by another manufacturer at the start of the Meiji period.

<text>In the mathematical disciplines of topology and geometry, an orbifold (for &quot;orbit-manifold&quot;) is a generalization of a manifold. Roughly speaking, an orbifold is a topological space that is locally a finite group quotient of a Euclidean space.

Definitions of orbifold have been given several times: by Ichirō Satake in the context of automorphic forms in the 1950s under the name &quot;V-manifold&quot;; by William Thurston in the context of the geometry of 3-manifolds in the 1970s when he coined the name &quot;orbifold&quot;, after a vote by his students; and by André Haefliger in the 1980s in the context of Mikhail Gromov&#x27;s programme on CAT(k) spaces under the name &quot;orbihedron&quot;.

Historically, orbifolds arose first as surfaces with singular points long before they were formally defined. One of the first classical examples arose in the theory of modular forms with the action of the modular group formula_1 on the upper half-plane: a version of the Riemann–Roch theorem holds after the quotient is compactified by the addition of two orbifold cusp points. In 3-manifold theory, the theory of Seifert fiber spaces, initiated by Herbert Seifert, can be phrased in terms of 2-dimensional orbifolds. In geometric group theory, post-Gromov, discrete groups have been studied in terms of the local curvature properties of orbihedra and their covering spaces.

In string theory, the word &quot;orbifold&quot; has a slightly different meaning, discussed in detail below. In two-dimensional conformal field theory, it refers to the theory attached to the fixed point subalgebra of a vertex algebra under the action of a finite group of automorphisms.

The main example of underlying space is a quotient space of a manifold under the properly discontinuous action of a possibly infinite group of diffeomorphisms with finite isotropy subgroups. In particular this applies to any action of a finite group; thus a manifold with boundary carries a natural orbifold structure, since it is the quotient of its double by an action of formula_2.

One topological space can carry different orbifold structures. For example, consider the orbifold formula_3 associated with a quotient space of the 2-sphere along a rotation by formula_4 ; it is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, but the natural orbifold structure is different. It is possible to adopt most of the characteristics of manifolds to orbifolds and these characteristics are usually different from correspondent characteristics of underlying space. In the above example, the &quot;orbifold fundamental group&quot; of formula_3 is formula_2 and its &quot;orbifold Euler characteristic&quot; is 1.

==Formal definitions==

=== Definition using orbifold atlas ===
Like a manifold, an orbifold is specified by local conditions; however, instead of being locally modelled on open subsets of formula_7, an orbifold is locally modelled on quotients of open subsets of formula_7 by finite group actions. The structure of an orbifold encodes not only that of the underlying quotient space, which need not be a manifold, but also that of the isotropy subgroups.

An formula_9-dimensional orbifold is a Hausdorff topological space formula_10, called the underlying space, with a covering by a collection of open sets formula_11, closed under finite intersection. For each formula_11, there is
* an open subset formula_13 of formula_7, invariant under a faithful linear action of a finite group formula_15;
* a continuous map formula_16 of formula_13 onto formula_11 invariant under formula_15, called an orbifold chart, which defines a homeomorphism between formula_20 and formula_11.

The collection of orbifold charts is called an orbifold atlas if the following properties are satisfied:
* for each inclusion formula_22 there is an injective group homomorphism formula_23.
* for each inclusion formula_22 there is a formula_15-equivariant homeomorphism formula_26, called a gluing map, of formula_13 onto an open subset of &quot;formula_28&quot;.
* the gluing maps are compatible with the charts, i.e. formula_29.
* the gluing maps are unique up to composition with group elements, i.e. any other possible gluing map from formula_13 to &quot;formula_28&quot; has the form formula_32 for a unique formula_33.

As for atlases on manifolds, two orbifold atlases of &quot;formula_10&quot; are equivalent if they can be consistently combined to give a larger orbifold atlas. An orbifold structure is therefore an equivalence class of orbifold atlases.

Note that the orbifold structure determines the isotropy subgroup of any point of the orbifold up to isomorphism: it can be computed as the stabilizer of the point in any orbifold chart. If &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot; formula_35 &quot;U&quot;&quot;j&quot; formula_35 &quot;U&quot;&quot;k&quot;, then there is a unique &quot;transition element&quot; &quot;g&quot;ijk in Γ&quot;k&quot; such that

:&quot;g&quot;&quot;ijk&quot;·&quot;ψ&quot;&quot;ik&quot; = &quot;ψ&quot;&quot;jk&quot;·&quot;ψ&quot;&quot;ij&quot;

These transition elements satisfy

:(Ad &quot;g&quot;&quot;ijk&quot;)·&quot;f&quot;&quot;ik&quot; = &quot;f&quot;&quot;jk&quot;·&quot;f&quot;&quot;ij&quot;

as well as the &quot;cocycle relation&quot; (guaranteeing associativity)

: &quot;f&quot;&quot;km&quot;(&quot;g&quot;&quot;ijk&quot;)·&quot;g&quot;&quot;ikm&quot; = &quot;g&quot;&quot;ijm&quot;·&quot;g&quot;&quot;jkm&quot;.

More generally, attached to an open covering of an orbifold by orbifold charts, there is the combinatorial data of a so-called &quot;complex of groups&quot; (see below).

Exactly as in the case of manifolds, differentiability conditions can be imposed on the gluing maps to give a definition of a differentiable orbifold. It will be a &quot;Riemannian orbifold&quot; if in addition there are invariant Riemannian metrics on the orbifold charts and the gluing maps are isometries.

===Definition using Lie groupoids===

Recall that a groupoid consists of a set of objects formula_37, a set of arrows formula_38, and structural maps including the source and the target maps formula_39 and other maps allowing arrows to be composed and inverted. It is called a Lie groupoid if both formula_37 and formula_38 are smooth manifolds, all structural maps are smooth, and both the source and the target maps are submersions. The intersection of the source and the target fiber at a given point formula_42, i.e. the set formula_43, is the Lie group called the isotropy group of formula_38 at formula_45. A Lie groupoid is called proper if the map formula_46 is a proper map, and étale if both the source and the target maps are local diffeomorphisms.

An orbifold groupoid is given by one of the following equivalent definitions:

* a proper étale Lie groupoid;
* a proper Lie groupoid whose isotropies are discrete spaces.

Since the isotropy groups of proper groupoids are automatically compact, the discreteness condition implies that the isotropies must be actually finite groups.

Orbifold groupoids play the same role as orbifold atlases in the definition above. Indeed, an orbifold structure on a Hausdorff topological space formula_10 is defined as the Morita equivalence class of an orbifold groupoid formula_48 together with a homeomorphism formula_49, where formula_50 is the orbit space of the Lie groupoid formula_51 (i.e. the quotient of formula_52 by the equivalent relation when formula_53 if there is a formula_54 with formula_55 and formula_56). This definition shows that orbifolds are a particular kind of differentiable stack.

== Relation between the two definitions ==
Given an orbifold atlas on a space formula_10, one can build a pseudogroup made up by all diffeomorphisms between open sets of formula_10 which preserve the transition functions formula_16. In turn, the space formula_60 of germs of its elements is an orbifold groupoid. Moreover, since by definition of orbifold atlas each finite group formula_15 acts faithfully on formula_13, the groupoid formula_60 is automatically effective, i.e. the map formula_64 is injective for every formula_65. Two different orbifold atlases give rise to the same orbifold structure if and only if their associated orbifold groupoids are Morita equivalent. Therefore, any orbifold structure according to the first definition (also called a classical orbifold) is a special kind of orbifold structure according to the second definition.

Conversely, given an orbifold groupoid formula_48, there is a canonical orbifold atlas over its orbit space, whose associated effective orbifold groupoid is Morita equivalent to formula_51. Since the orbit spaces of Morita equivalent groupoids are homeomorphic, an orbifold structure according to the second definition reduces an orbifold structure according to the first definition in the effective case.

Accordingly, while the notion of orbifold atlas is simpler and more commonly present in the literature, the notion of orbifold groupoid is particularly useful when discussing non-effective orbifolds and maps between orbifolds. For example, a map between orbifolds can be described by a homomorphism between groupoids, which carries more information than the underlying continuous map between the underlying topological spaces.

==Examples==
* Any manifold without boundary is trivially an orbifold, where each of the groups Γ&quot;i&quot; is the trivial group. Equivalently, it corresponds to the Morita equivalence class of the unit groupoid.
* If &quot;N&quot; is a compact manifold with boundary, its double &quot;M&quot; can be formed by gluing together a copy of &quot;N&quot; and its mirror image along their common boundary. There is natural &quot;reflection&quot; action of Z2 on the manifold &quot;M&quot; fixing the common boundary; the quotient space can be identified with &quot;N&quot;, so that &quot;N&quot; has a natural orbifold structure.
* If &quot;M&quot; is a Riemannian &quot;n&quot;-manifold with a cocompact proper isometric action of a discrete group Γ, then the orbit space &quot;X&quot; = &quot;M&quot;/Γ has natural orbifold structure: for each &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; take a representative &quot;m&quot; in &quot;M&quot; and an open neighbourhood &quot;V&quot;&quot;m&quot; of &quot;m&quot; invariant under the stabiliser Γ&quot;m&quot;, identified equivariantly with a Γ&quot;m&quot;-subset of &quot;T&quot;&quot;m&quot;&quot;M&quot; under the exponential map at &quot;m&quot;; finitely many neighbourhoods cover &quot;X&quot; and each of their finite intersections, if non-empty, is covered by an intersection of Γ-translates &quot;g&quot;&quot;m&quot;·&quot;V&quot;&quot;m&quot; with corresponding group &quot;g&quot;&quot;m&quot; Γ &quot;g&quot;&quot;m&quot;−1. Orbifolds that arise in this way are called &quot;developable&quot; or &quot;good&quot;.
* A classical theorem of Henri Poincaré constructs Fuchsian groups as hyperbolic reflection groups generated by reflections in the edges of a geodesic triangle in the hyperbolic plane for the Poincaré metric. If the triangle has angles /&quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot; for positive integers &quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot;, the triangle is a fundamental domain and naturally a 2-dimensional orbifold. The corresponding group is an example of a hyperbolic triangle group. Poincaré also gave a 3-dimensional version of this result for Kleinian groups: in this case the Kleinian group Γ is generated by hyperbolic reflections and the orbifold is H3 / Γ.
* If &quot;M&quot; is a closed 2-manifold, new orbifold structures can be defined on &quot;M&quot;i by removing finitely many disjoint closed discs from &quot;M&quot; and gluing back copies of discs &quot;D&quot;/ Γ&quot;i&quot; where &quot;D&quot; is the closed unit disc and Γ&quot;i&quot; is a finite cyclic group of rotations. This generalises Poincaré&#x27;s construction.

==Orbifold fundamental group==
There are several ways to define the orbifold fundamental group. More sophisticated approaches use orbifold covering spaces or classifying spaces of groupoids. The simplest approach (adopted by Haefliger and known also to Thurston) extends the usual notion of loop used in the standard definition of the fundamental group.

An orbifold path is a path in the underlying space provided with an explicit piecewise lift of path segments to orbifold charts and explicit group elements identifying paths in overlapping charts; if the underlying path is a loop, it is called an orbifold loop. Two orbifold paths are identified if they are related through multiplication by group elements in orbifold charts. The orbifold fundamental group is the group formed by homotopy classes of orbifold loops.

If the orbifold arises as the quotient of a simply connected manifold &quot;M&quot; by a proper rigid action of a discrete group Γ, the orbifold fundamental group can be identified with Γ. In general it is an extension of Γ by 1 &quot;M&quot;.

The orbifold is said to be &quot;developable&quot; or &quot;good&quot; if it arises as the quotient by a group action; otherwise it is called &quot;bad&quot;. A &quot;universal covering orbifold&quot; can be constructed for an orbifold by direct analogy with the construction of the universal covering space of a topological space, namely as the space of pairs consisting of points of the orbifold and homotopy classes of orbifold paths joining them to the basepoint. This space is naturally an orbifold.

Note that if an orbifold chart on a contractible open subset corresponds to a group Γ, then there is a natural &quot;local homomorphism&quot; of Γ into the orbifold fundamental group.

In fact the following conditions are equivalent:
* The orbifold is developable.
* The orbifold structure on the universal covering orbifold is trivial.
* The local homomorphisms are all injective for a covering by contractible open sets.

=== Orbifolds as diffeologies ===

Orbifolds can be defined in the general framework of diffeology and have been proved to be equivalent to Ichirô Satake&#x27;s original definition:

Definition: An orbifold is a diffeological space locally diffeomorphic at each point to some formula_68, where formula_9 is an integer and formula_51 is a finite linear group which may change from point to point.

This definition calls a few remarks:

* This definition mimics the definition of a manifold in diffeology, which is a diffeological space locally diffeomorphic at each point to formula_7.
* An orbifold is regarded first as a diffeological space, a set equipped with a diffeology. Then, the diffeology is tested to be locally diffeomorphic at each point to a quotient formula_68 with formula_51 a finite linear group.
* This definition is equivalent with Haefliger orbifolds.
* {Orbifolds} makes a subcategory of the category {Diffeology} whose objects are diffeological spaces and morphisms smooth maps. A smooth map between orbifolds is any map which is smooth for their diffeologies. This resolves, in the context of Satake&#x27;s definition, his remark: &quot;The notion of formula_74-map thus defined is inconvenient in the point that a composite of two formula_74-map defined in a different choice of defining families is not always a formula_74-map.&quot; Indeed, there are smooth maps between orbifolds that do not lift locally as equivariant maps.

Note that the fundamental group of an orbifold as a diffeological space is not the same as the fundamental group as defined above. That last one is related to the structure groupoid and its isotropy groups.

==Orbispaces==

For applications in geometric group theory, it is often convenient to have a slightly more general notion of orbifold, due to Haefliger. An orbispace is to topological spaces what an orbifold is to manifolds. An orbispace is a topological generalization of the orbifold concept. It is defined by replacing the model for the orbifold charts by a locally compact space with a &quot;rigid&quot; action of a finite group, i.e. one for which points with trivial isotropy are dense. (This condition is automatically satisfied by faithful linear actions, because the points fixed by any non-trivial group element form a proper linear subspace.) It is also useful to consider metric space structures on an orbispace, given by invariant metrics on the orbispace charts for which the gluing maps preserve distance. In this case each orbispace chart is usually required to be a length space with unique geodesics connecting any two points.

Let &quot;X&quot; be an orbispace endowed with a metric space structure for which the charts are geodesic length spaces. The preceding definitions and results for orbifolds can be generalized to give definitions of &quot;orbispace fundamental group&quot; and &quot;universal covering orbispace&quot;, with analogous criteria for developability. The distance functions on the orbispace charts can be used to define the length of an orbispace path in the universal covering orbispace. If the distance function in each chart is non-positively curved, then the Birkhoff curve shortening argument can be used to prove that any orbispace path with fixed endpoints is homotopic to a unique geodesic. Applying this to constant paths in an orbispace chart, it follows that each local homomorphism is injective and hence:
* every non-positively curved orbispace is developable (i.e. &quot;good&quot;).

==Complexes of groups==
Every orbifold has associated with it an additional combinatorial structure given by a &quot;complex of groups&quot;.

===Definition===
A complex of groups (&quot;Y&quot;,&quot;f&quot;,&quot;g&quot;) on an abstract simplicial complex &quot;Y&quot; is given by
* a finite group Γσ for each simplex σ of &quot;Y&quot;
* an injective homomorphism &quot;f&quot;στ : Γτ formula_77 Γσ whenever σ formula_78 τ
* for every inclusion ρ formula_78 σ formula_78 τ, a group element &quot;g&quot;ρστ in Γρ such that (Ad &quot;g&quot;ρστ)·&quot;f&quot;ρτ = &quot;f&quot;ρσ·&quot;f&quot;στ (here Ad denotes the adjoint action by conjugation)

The group elements must in addition satisfy the cocycle condition

:&quot;f&quot;&quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;g&quot;ρστ) &quot;g&quot;πρτ = &quot;g&quot;&quot;στ&quot; &quot;g&quot;&quot;ρσ&quot;

for every chain of simplices formula_81 (This condition is vacuous if &quot;Y&quot; has dimension 2 or less.)

Any choice of elements &quot;h&quot;&quot;στ&quot; in Γ&quot;σ&quot; yields an &quot;equivalent&quot; complex of groups by defining
* &quot;f&quot;&#x27;&quot;στ&quot; = (Ad &quot;h&quot;&quot;στ&quot;)·&quot;f&quot;&quot;στ&quot;
* &quot;g&quot;&#x27;&quot;ρστ&quot; = &quot;h&quot;ρσ·&quot;f&quot;&quot;ρσ&quot;(&quot;h&quot;&quot;στ&quot;)·&quot;g&quot;&quot;ρστ&quot;·&quot;h&quot;&quot;ρτ&quot;−1

A complex of groups is called simple whenever &quot;g&quot;&quot;ρστ&quot; = 1 everywhere.
* An easy inductive argument shows that every complex of groups on a &quot;simplex&quot; is equivalent to a complex of groups with &quot;g&quot;&quot;ρστ&quot; = 1 everywhere.

It is often more convenient and conceptually appealing to pass to the barycentric subdivision of &quot;Y&quot;. The vertices of this subdivision correspond to the simplices of &quot;Y&quot;, so that each vertex has a group attached to it. The edges of the barycentric subdivision are naturally oriented (corresponding to inclusions of simplices) and each directed edge gives an inclusion of groups. Each triangle has a transition element attached to it belonging to the group of exactly one vertex; and the tetrahedra, if there are any, give cocycle relations for the transition elements. Thus a complex of groups involves only the 3-skeleton of the barycentric subdivision; and only the 2-skeleton if it is simple.

===Example===
If &quot;X&quot; is an orbifold (or orbispace), choose a covering by open subsets from amongst the orbifold charts &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; : &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; formula_77 &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Let &quot;Y&quot; be the abstract simplicial complex given by the nerve of the covering: its vertices are the sets of the cover and its &quot;n&quot;-simplices correspond to &quot;non-empty&quot; intersections &quot;U&quot;&quot;α&quot; = &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot;1 formula_83 ··· formula_83 &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot;. For each such simplex there is an associated group Γα and the homomorphisms &quot;f&quot;&quot;ij&quot; become the homomorphisms &quot;f&quot;στ. For every triple ρ formula_35 σ formula_35 τ corresponding to intersections

: formula_87

there are charts &quot;φ&quot;&quot;i&quot; : &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; formula_77 &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;&quot;ij&quot; : &quot;V&quot;&quot;ij&quot; formula_77 &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot; formula_83 &quot;U&quot;&quot;j&quot; and φ&quot;ijk&quot; : &quot;V&quot;&quot;ijk&quot; formula_77 &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot; formula_83 &quot;U&quot;&quot;j&quot; formula_83 &quot;U&quot;&quot;k&quot; and gluing maps ψ : &quot;V&quot; &quot;ij&quot; formula_94 &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;, ψ&#x27; : &quot;V&quot; &quot;ijk&quot; formula_94 &quot;V&quot;&quot;ij&quot; and ψ&quot; : &quot;V&quot; &quot;ijk&quot; formula_94 &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;.

There is a unique transition element &quot;g&quot;ρστ in Γ&quot;i&quot; such that &quot;g&quot;&quot;ρστ&quot;·&quot;ψ&quot;&quot; = &quot;ψ&quot;·&quot;&quot;. The relations satisfied by the transition elements of an orbifold imply those required for a complex of groups. In this way a complex of groups can be canonically associated to the nerve of an open covering by orbifold (or orbispace) charts. In the language of non-commutative sheaf theory and gerbes, the complex of groups in this case arises as a sheaf of groups associated to the covering &quot;U&quot;&quot;i&quot;; the data &quot;g&quot;ρστ is a 2-cocycle in non-commutative sheaf cohomology and the data &quot;h&quot;στ gives a 2-coboundary perturbation.

===Edge-path group===
The edge-path group of a complex of groups can be defined as a natural generalisation of the edge path group of a simplicial complex. In the barycentric subdivision of &quot;Y&quot;, take generators &quot;e&quot;&quot;ij&quot; corresponding to edges from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot; where &quot;i&quot; formula_94 &quot;j&quot;, so that there is an injection ψ&quot;ij&quot; : Γ&quot;i&quot; formula_98 Γ&quot;j&quot;. Let Γ be the group generated by the &quot;e&quot;&quot;ij&quot; and Γ&quot;k&quot; with relations

:&quot;e&quot;&quot;ij&quot; −1 · &quot;g&quot; · &quot;e&quot;&quot;ij&quot; = ψ&quot;ij&quot;(&quot;g&quot;)

for &quot;g&quot; in Γ&quot;i&quot; and

:&quot;e&quot;&quot;ik&quot; = &quot;e&quot;&quot;jk&quot;·&quot;e&quot;&quot;ij&quot;·&quot;g&quot;&quot;ijk&quot;

if &quot;i&quot; formula_94 &quot;j&quot; formula_77 &quot;k&quot;.

For a fixed vertex &quot;i&quot;0, the edge-path group Γ(&quot;i&quot;0) is defined to be the subgroup of Γ generated by all products

:&quot;g&quot;0 · e&quot;i&quot;0 &quot;i&quot;1 · &quot;g&quot;1 · e&quot;i&quot;1 &quot;i&quot;2 · ··· · &quot;g&quot;&quot;n&quot; · e&quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;i&quot; 0 

where &quot;i&quot;0, &quot;i&quot;1, ..., &quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;i&quot;0
is an edge-path, &quot;g&quot;&quot;k&quot; lies in Γ&quot;i&quot;&quot;k&quot; and &quot;e&quot;&quot;ji&quot;=&quot;e&quot;&quot;ij&quot;−1 if &quot;i&quot; formula_94 &quot;j&quot;.

===Developable complexes===
A simplicial proper action of a discrete group Γ on a simplicial complex &quot;X&quot; with finite quotient is said to be regular if it
satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:
* &quot;X&quot; admits a finite subcomplex as fundamental domain;
* the quotient &quot;Y&quot; = &quot;X&quot;/Γ has a natural simplicial structure;
* the quotient simplicial structure on orbit-representatives of vertices is consistent;
* if (&quot;v&quot;0, ..., &quot;v&quot;&quot;k&quot;) and (&quot;g&quot;0·&quot;v&quot;0, ..., &quot;g&quot;&quot;k&quot;·&quot;v&quot;&quot;k&quot;) are simplices, then &quot;g&quot;·&quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;g&quot;&quot;i&quot;·&quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; for some &quot;g&quot; in Γ.

The fundamental domain and quotient &quot;Y&quot; = &quot;X&quot; / Γ can naturally be identified as simplicial complexes in this case, given by the stabilisers of the simplices in the fundamental domain. A complex of groups &quot;Y&quot; is said to be developable if it arises in this way.
* A complex of groups is developable if and only if the homomorphisms of Γσ into the edge-path group are injective.
* A complex of groups is developable if and only if for each simplex σ there is an injective homomorphism θσ from Γσ into a fixed discrete group Γ such that θτ·&quot;f&quot;στ = θσ. In this case the simplicial complex &quot;X&quot; is canonically defined: it has &quot;k&quot;-simplices (σ, xΓσ) where σ is a &quot;k&quot;-simplex of &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;x&quot; runs over Γ / Γσ. Consistency can be checked using the fact that the restriction of the complex of groups to a &quot;simplex&quot; is equivalent to one with trivial cocycle &quot;g&quot;ρστ.

The action of Γ on the barycentric subdivision &quot;X&quot; &#x27; of &quot;X&quot; always satisfies the following condition, weaker than regularity:
* whenever σ and &quot;g&quot;·σ are subsimplices of some simplex τ, they are equal, i.e. σ = &quot;g&quot;·σ

Indeed, simplices in &quot;X&quot; &#x27; correspond to chains of simplices in &quot;X&quot;, so that a subsimplices, given by subchains of simplices, is uniquely determined by the &quot;sizes&quot; of the simplices in the subchain. When an action satisfies this condition, then &quot;g&quot; necessarily fixes all the vertices of σ. A straightforward inductive argument shows that such an action becomes regular on the barycentric subdivision; in particular
* the action on the second barycentric subdivision &quot;X&quot;&quot; is regular;
* Γ is naturally isomorphic to the edge-path group defined using edge-paths and vertex stabilisers for the barycentric subdivision of the fundamental domain in &quot;X&quot;&quot;.

There is in fact no need to pass to a &quot;third&quot; barycentric subdivision: as Haefliger observes using the language of category theory, in this case the 3-skeleton of the fundamental domain of &quot;X&quot;&quot; already carries all the necessary data – including transition elements for triangles – to define an edge-path group isomorphic to Γ.

In two dimensions this is particularly simple to describe. The fundamental domain of &quot;X&quot;&quot; has the same structure as the barycentric subdivision &quot;Y&quot; &#x27; of a complex of groups &quot;Y&quot;, namely:
* a finite 2-dimensional simplicial complex &quot;Z&quot;;
* an orientation for all edges &quot;i&quot; formula_94 &quot;j&quot;;
* if &quot;i&quot; formula_94 &quot;j&quot; and &quot;j&quot; formula_94 &quot;k&quot; are edges, then &quot;i&quot; formula_94 &quot;k&quot; is an edge and (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot;) is a triangle;
* finite groups attached to vertices, inclusions to edges and transition elements, describing compatibility, to triangles.

An edge-path group can then be defined. A similar structure is inherited by the barycentric subdivision &quot;Z&quot; &#x27; and its edge-path group is isomorphic to that of &quot;Z&quot;.

==Orbihedra==
If a countable discrete group acts by a &quot;regular&quot; &quot;simplicial&quot; proper action on a simplicial complex, the quotient can be given not only the structure of a complex of groups, but also that of an orbispace. This leads more generally to the definition of &quot;orbihedron&quot;, the simplicial analogue of an orbifold.

===Definition===
Let &quot;X&quot; be a finite simplicial complex with barycentric subdivision &quot;X&quot; &#x27;. An orbihedron structure consists of:
* for each vertex &quot;i&quot; of &quot;X&quot; &#x27;, a simplicial complex &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27; endowed with a rigid simplicial action of a finite group Γ&quot;i&quot;.
* a simplicial map φ&quot;i&quot; of &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27; onto the link &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot; of &quot;i&quot; in &quot;X&quot; &#x27;, identifying the quotient &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27; / Γ&quot;i&quot; with &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot;.

This action of Γ&quot;i&quot; on &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27; extends to a simplicial action on the simplicial cone &quot;C&quot;&quot;i&quot; over &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27; (the simplicial join of &quot;i&quot; and &quot;L&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;), fixing the centre &quot;i&quot; of the cone. The map φ&quot;i&quot; extends to a simplicial map of
&quot;C&quot;&quot;i&quot; onto the star St(&quot;i&quot;) of &quot;i&quot;, carrying the centre onto &quot;i&quot;; thus φ&quot;i&quot; identifies &quot;C&quot;&quot;i&quot; / Γ&quot;i&quot;, the quotient of the star of &quot;i&quot; in &quot;C&quot;&quot;i&quot;, with St(&quot;i&quot;) and gives an &quot;orbihedron chart&quot; at &quot;i&quot;.
* for each directed edge &quot;i&quot; formula_77 &quot;j&quot; of &quot;X&quot; &#x27;, an injective homomorphism &quot;f&quot;&quot;ij&quot; of Γ&quot;i&quot; into Γ&quot;j&quot;.
* for each directed edge &quot;i&quot; formula_77 &quot;j&quot;, a Γ&quot;i&quot; equivariant simplicial &quot;gluing map&quot; ψ&quot;ij&quot; of &quot;C&quot;&quot;i&quot; into &quot;C&quot;&quot;j&quot;.
* the gluing maps are compatible with the charts, i.e. φ&quot;j&quot;·ψ&quot;ij&quot; = φ&quot;i&quot;.
* the gluing maps are unique up to composition with group elements, i.e. any other possible gluing map from &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; to &quot;V&quot;&quot;j&quot; has the form &quot;g&quot;·ψ&quot;ij&quot; for a unique &quot;g&quot; in Γ&quot;j&quot;.

If &quot;i&quot;formula_108 &quot;j&quot; formula_108 &quot;k&quot;, then there is a unique &quot;transition element&quot; &quot;g&quot;ijk in Γ&quot;k&quot; such that

:&quot;g&quot;&quot;ijk&quot;·ψ&quot;ik&quot; = ψ&quot;jk&quot;·ψ&quot;ij&quot;

These transition elements satisfy

:(Ad &quot;g&quot;&quot;ijk&quot;)·&quot;f&quot;&quot;ik&quot; = &quot;f&quot;&quot;jk&quot;·&quot;f&quot;&quot;ij&quot;

as well as the cocycle relation

:ψ&quot;km&quot;(&quot;g&quot;&quot;ijk&quot;)·&quot;g&quot;&quot;ikm&quot; = &quot;g&quot;&quot;ijm&quot;·&quot;g&quot;&quot;jkm&quot;.

===Main properties===
* The group theoretic data of an orbihedron gives a complex of groups on &quot;X&quot;, because the vertices &quot;i&quot; of the barycentric subdivision &quot;X&quot; &#x27; correspond to the simplices in &quot;X&quot;.
* Every complex of groups on &quot;X&quot; is associated with an essentially unique orbihedron structure on &quot;X&quot;. This key fact follows by noting that the star and link of a vertex &quot;i&quot; of &quot;X&quot; &#x27;, corresponding to a simplex σ of &quot;X&quot;, have natural decompositions: the star is isomorphic to the abstract simplicial complex given by the join of σ and the barycentric subdivision σ&#x27; of σ; and the link is isomorphic to join of the link of σ in &quot;X&quot; and the link of the barycentre of σ in σ&#x27;. Restricting the complex of groups to the link of σ in &quot;X&quot;, all the groups Γτ come with injective homomorphisms into Γσ. Since the link of &quot;i&quot; in &quot;X&quot; &#x27; is canonically covered by a simplicial complex on which Γσ acts, this defines an orbihedron structure on &quot;X&quot;.
* The orbihedron fundamental group is (tautologically) just the edge-path group of the associated complex of groups.
* Every orbihedron is also naturally an orbispace: indeed in the geometric realization of the simplicial complex, orbispace charts can be defined using the interiors of stars.
* The orbihedron fundamental group can be naturally identified with the orbispace fundamental group of the associated orbispace. This follows by applying the simplicial approximation theorem to segments of an orbispace path lying in an orbispace chart: it is a straightforward variant of the classical proof that the fundamental group of a polyhedron can be identified with its edge-path group.
* The orbispace associated to an orbihedron has a &quot;canonical metric structure&quot;, coming locally from the length metric in the standard geometric realization in Euclidean space, with vertices mapped to an orthonormal basis. Other metric structures are also used, involving length metrics obtained by realizing the simplices in hyperbolic space, with simplices identified isometrically along common boundaries.
* The orbispace associated to an orbihedron is non-positively curved if and only if the link in each orbihedron chart has girth greater than or equal to 6, i.e. any closed circuit in the link has length at least 6. This condition, well known from the theory of Hadamard spaces, depends only on the underlying complex of groups.
* When the universal covering orbihedron is non-positively curved the fundamental group is infinite and is generated by isomorphic copies of the isotropy groups. This follows from the corresponding result for orbispaces.

==Triangles of groups==
Historically one of the most important applications of orbifolds in geometric group theory has been to &quot;triangles of groups&quot;. This is the simplest 2-dimensional example generalising the 1-dimensional &quot;interval of groups&quot; discussed in Serre&#x27;s lectures on trees, where amalgamated free products are studied in terms of actions on trees. Such triangles of groups arise any time a discrete group acts simply transitively on the triangles in the affine Bruhat–Tits building for &quot;SL&quot;3(Qp); in 1979 Mumford discovered the first example for &quot;p&quot; = 2 (see below) as a step in producing an algebraic surface not isomorphic to projective space, but having the same Betti numbers. Triangles of groups were worked out in detail by Gersten and Stallings, while the more general case of complexes of groups, described above, was developed independently by Haefliger. The underlying geometric method of analysing finitely presented groups in terms of metric spaces of non-positive curvature is due to Gromov. In this context triangles of groups correspond to non-positively curved 2-dimensional simplicial complexes with the regular action of a group, transitive on triangles.
A triangle of groups is a &quot;simple&quot; complex of groups consisting of a triangle with vertices A, B, C. There are groups
* ΓA, ΓB, ΓC at each vertex
* ΓBC, ΓCA, ΓAB for each edge
* ΓABC for the triangle itself.

There are injective homomorphisms of ΓABC into all the other groups and of an edge group ΓXY into ΓX and ΓY. The three ways of mapping ΓABC into a vertex group all agree. (Often ΓABC is the trivial group.) The Euclidean metric structure on the corresponding orbispace is non-positively curved if and only if the link of each of the vertices in the orbihedron chart has girth at least 6.

This girth at each vertex is always even and, as observed by Stallings, can be described at a vertex A, say, as the length of the smallest word in the kernel of the natural homomorphism into ΓA of the amalgamated free product over ΓABC of the edge groups ΓAB and ΓAC:

:formula_110

The result using the Euclidean metric structure is not optimal. Angles α, β, γ at the vertices A, B and C were defined by Stallings as 2π divided by the girth. In the Euclidean case α, β, γ ≤ π/3. However, if it is only required that α + β + γ ≤ π, it is possible to identify the
triangle with the corresponding geodesic triangle in the hyperbolic plane with the Poincaré metric (or the Euclidean plane if equality holds). It is a classical result from hyperbolic geometry that the hyperbolic medians intersect in the hyperbolic barycentre, just as in the familiar Euclidean case. The barycentric subdivision and metric from this model yield a non-positively curved metric structure on the corresponding orbispace. Thus, if α+β+γ≤π,
* the orbispace of the triangle of groups is developable;
* the corresponding edge-path group, which can also be described as the colimit of the triangle of groups, is infinite;
* the homomorphisms of the vertex groups into the edge-path group are injections.

===Mumford&#x27;s example===

Let &quot;α&quot; = formula_111 be given by the binomial expansion of (1 − 8)1/2 in Q2 and set &quot;K&quot; = Q(&quot;α&quot;) formula_112 Q2. Let

: &quot;ζ&quot; = exp 2&quot;i&quot;/7

: &quot;λ&quot; = (&quot;α&quot; − 1)/2 = &quot;ζ&quot; + &quot;ζ&quot;2 + &quot;ζ&quot;4

: &quot;μ&quot; = &quot;λ&quot;/&quot;λ&quot;*.

Let &quot;E&quot; = Q(&quot;ζ&quot;), a 3-dimensional vector space over &quot;K&quot; with basis 1, &quot;ζ&quot;, and &quot;ζ&quot;2. Define &quot;K&quot;-linear operators on &quot;E&quot; as follows:
* &quot;σ&quot; is the generator of the Galois group of &quot;E&quot; over &quot;K&quot;, an element of order 3 given by σ(ζ) = ζ2
* &quot;τ&quot; is the operator of multiplication by &quot;ζ&quot; on &quot;E&quot;, an element of order 7
* &quot;ρ&quot; is the operator given by &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;ζ&quot;) = 1, &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;ζ&quot;2) = &quot;ζ&quot; and &quot;ρ&quot;(1) = &quot;μ&quot;·&quot;ζ&quot;2, so that &quot;ρ&quot;3 is scalar multiplication by &quot;μ&quot;.

The elements &quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;σ&quot;, and &quot;τ&quot; generate a discrete subgroup of &quot;GL&quot;3(&quot;K&quot;) which acts properly on the affine Bruhat–Tits building corresponding to &quot;SL&quot;3(Q2). This group acts &quot;transitively&quot; on all vertices, edges and triangles in the building. Let

: &quot;σ&quot;1 = &quot;σ&quot;, &quot;σ&quot;2 = &quot;ρσρ&quot;−1, &quot;σ&quot;3 = &quot;ρ&quot;2&quot;σρ&quot;−2.

Then
* &quot;σ&quot;1, &quot;σ&quot;2 and &quot;σ&quot;3 generate a subgroup Γ of &quot;SL&quot;3(&quot;K&quot;).
* Γ is the smallest subgroup generated by &quot;σ&quot; and &quot;τ&quot;, invariant under conjugation by &quot;ρ&quot;.
* Γ acts simply transitively on the triangles in the building.
* There is a triangle Δ such that the stabiliser of its edges are the subgroups of order 3 generated by the &quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot;&#x27;s.
* The stabiliser of a vertices of Δ is the Frobenius group of order 21 generated by the two order 3 elements stabilising the edges meeting at the vertex.
* The stabiliser of Δ is trivial.

The elements &quot;σ&quot; and &quot;τ&quot; generate the stabiliser of a vertex. The link of this vertex can be identified with the spherical building of &quot;SL&quot;3(F2) and the stabiliser can be identified with the collineation group of the Fano plane generated by a 3-fold symmetry σ fixing a point and a cyclic permutation τ of all 7 points, satisfying &quot;στ&quot; = &quot;τ&quot;2&quot;σ&quot;. Identifying F8* with the Fano plane, σ can be taken to be the restriction of the Frobenius automorphism &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;22 of F8 and τ to be multiplication by any element not in the prime field F2, i.e. an order 7 generator of the cyclic multiplicative group of F8. This Frobenius group acts simply transitively on the 21 flags in the Fano plane, i.e. lines with marked points. The formulas for σ and τ on &quot;E&quot; thus &quot;lift&quot; the formulas on F8.

Mumford also obtains an action simply transitive on the vertices of the building by passing to a subgroup of Γ1 = &lt;&quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;σ&quot;, &quot;τ&quot;, −&quot;I&quot;&gt;. The group Γ1 preserves the Q(&quot;α&quot;)-valued Hermitian form

: &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;xy&quot;* + &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;xy&quot;*) + &quot;σ&quot;2(&quot;xy&quot;*)

on Q(ζ) and can be identified with &quot;U&quot;3(f) formula_83 &quot;GL&quot;3(&quot;S&quot;) where &quot;S&quot; = Z[&quot;α&quot;,]. Since &quot;S&quot;/(&quot;α&quot;) = F7, there is a homomorphism of the group Γ1 into &quot;GL&quot;3(F7). This action leaves invariant a 2-dimensional subspace in F73 and hence gives rise to a homomorphism &quot;Ψ&quot; of Γ1 into &quot;SL&quot;2(F7), a group of order 16·3·7. On the other hand, the stabiliser of a vertex is a subgroup of order 21 and &quot;Ψ&quot; is injective on this subgroup. Thus if the congruence subgroup Γ0 is defined as the inverse image under &quot;Ψ&quot; of the 2-Sylow subgroup of &quot;SL&quot;2(F7), the action of
Γ0 on vertices must be simply transitive.

===Generalizations===
Other examples of triangles or 2-dimensional complexes of groups can be constructed by variations of the above example.

Cartwright et al. consider actions on buildings that are simply transitive on vertices. Each such action produces a bijection (or modified duality) between the points &quot;x&quot; and lines &quot;x&quot;* in the flag complex of a finite projective plane and a collection of oriented triangles of points (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;), invariant under cyclic permutation, such that &quot;x&quot; lies on &quot;z&quot;*, &quot;y&quot; lies on &quot;x&quot;* and &quot;z&quot; lies on &quot;y&quot;* and any two points uniquely determine the third. The groups produced have generators &quot;x&quot;, labelled by points, and relations &quot;xyz&quot; = 1 for each triangle. Generically this construction will not correspond to an action on a classical affine building.

More generally, as shown by Ballmann and Brin, similar algebraic data encodes all actions that are simply transitively on the vertices of a non-positively curved 2-dimensional simplicial complex, provided the link of each vertex has girth at least 6. This data consists of:
* a generating set &quot;S&quot; containing inverses, but not the identity;
* a set of relations &quot;g&quot; &quot;h&quot; &quot;k&quot; = 1, invariant under cyclic permutation.

The elements &quot;g&quot; in &quot;S&quot; label the vertices &quot;g&quot;·&quot;v&quot; in the link of a fixed vertex &quot;v&quot;; and the relations correspond to edges (&quot;g&quot;−1·&quot;v&quot;, &quot;h&quot;·&quot;v&quot;) in that link. The graph with vertices &quot;S&quot; and edges (&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;), for &quot;g&quot;−1&quot;h&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, must have girth at least 6. The original simplicial complex can be reconstructed using complexes of groups and the second barycentric subdivision.
Further examples of non-positively curved 2-dimensional complexes of groups have been constructed by Swiatkowski based on actions simply transitive on oriented edges and inducing a 3-fold symmetry on each triangle; in this case too the complex of groups is obtained from the regular action on the second barycentric subdivision. The simplest example, discovered earlier with Ballmann, starts from a finite group &quot;H&quot; with a symmetric set of generators &quot;S&quot;, not containing the identity, such that the corresponding Cayley graph has girth at least 6. The associated group is generated by &quot;H&quot; and an involution τ subject to (τg)3 = 1 for each &quot;g&quot; in &quot;S&quot;.

In fact, if Γ acts in this way, fixing an edge (&quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;), there is an involution τ interchanging &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot;. The link of &quot;v&quot; is made up of vertices &quot;g&quot;·&quot;w&quot; for &quot;g&quot; in a symmetric subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;H&quot; = Γ&quot;v&quot;, generating &quot;H&quot; if the link is connected. The assumption on triangles implies that

:τ·(&quot;g&quot;·&quot;w&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;−1·&quot;w&quot;

for &quot;g&quot; in &quot;S&quot;. Thus, if σ = τ&quot;g&quot; and &quot;u&quot; = &quot;g&quot;−1·&quot;w&quot;, then

:σ(&quot;v&quot;) = &quot;w&quot;, σ(&quot;w&quot;) = &quot;u&quot;, σ(&quot;u&quot;) = &quot;w&quot;.

By simple transitivity on the triangle (&quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;u&quot;), it follows that σ3 = 1.

The second barycentric subdivision gives a complex of groups consisting of singletons or pairs of barycentrically subdivided triangles joined along their large sides: these pairs are indexed by the quotient space &quot;S&quot;/~ obtained by identifying inverses in &quot;S&quot;. The single or &quot;coupled&quot; triangles are in turn joined along one common &quot;spine&quot;. All stabilisers of simplices are trivial except for the two vertices at the ends of the spine, with stabilisers &quot;H&quot; and &lt;τ&gt;, and the remaining vertices of the large triangles, with stabiliser generated by an appropriate σ. Three of the smaller triangles in each large triangle contain transition elements.

When all the elements of &quot;S&quot; are involutions, none of the triangles need to be doubled. If &quot;H&quot; is taken to be the dihedral group &quot;D&quot;7 of order 14, generated by an involution &quot;a&quot; and an element &quot;b&quot; of order 7 such that

:&quot;ab&quot;= &quot;b&quot;−1&quot;a&quot;,

then &quot;H&quot; is generated by the 3 involutions &quot;a&quot;, &quot;ab&quot; and &quot;ab&quot;5. The link of each vertex is given by the corresponding Cayley graph, so is just the bipartite Heawood graph, i.e. exactly the same as in the affine building for &quot;SL&quot;3(Q2). This link structure implies that the corresponding simplicial complex is necessarily a Euclidean building. At present, however, it seems to be unknown whether any of these types of action can in fact be realised on a classical affine building: Mumford&#x27;s group Γ1 (modulo scalars) is only simply transitive on edges, not on oriented edges.

==Two-dimensional orbifolds==

Two-dimensional orbifolds have the following three types of singular points:

* A boundary point
* An elliptic point or gyration point of order &quot;n&quot;, such as the origin of R2 quotiented out by a cyclic group of order &quot;n&quot; of rotations.
* A corner reflector of order &quot;n&quot;: the origin of R2 quotiented out by a dihedral group of order 2&quot;n&quot;.

A compact 2-dimensional orbifold has an Euler characteristic formula_114
given by
:formula_115,
where formula_116 is the Euler characteristic of the underlying topological manifold formula_117, and formula_118 are the orders of the corner reflectors, and formula_119 are the orders of the elliptic points.

A 2-dimensional compact connected orbifold has a hyperbolic structure if its Euler characteristic is less than 0, a Euclidean structure if it is 0, and if its Euler characteristic is positive it is either bad or has an elliptic structure (an orbifold is called bad if it does not have a manifold as a covering space). In other words, its universal covering space has a hyperbolic, Euclidean, or spherical structure.

The compact 2-dimensional connected orbifolds that are not hyperbolic are listed in the table below. The 17 parabolic orbifolds are the quotients of the plane by the 17 wallpaper groups.

==3-dimensional orbifolds==

A 3-manifold is said to be &quot;small&quot; if it is closed, irreducible and does not contain any incompressible surfaces.

Orbifold Theorem. Let &quot;M&quot; be a small 3-manifold. Let φ be a non-trivial periodic orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of &quot;M&quot;. Then &quot;M&quot; admits a φ-invariant hyperbolic or Seifert fibered structure.

This theorem is a special case of Thurston&#x27;s orbifold theorem, announced without proof in 1981; it forms part of his geometrization conjecture for 3-manifolds. In particular it implies that if &quot;X&quot; is a compact, connected, orientable, irreducible, atoroidal 3-orbifold with non-empty singular locus, then &quot;M&quot; has a geometric structure (in the sense of orbifolds). A complete proof of the theorem was published by Boileau, Leeb &amp; Porti in 2005.

==Applications==

===Orbifolds in string theory===
In string theory, the word &quot;orbifold&quot; has a slightly new meaning. For mathematicians, an orbifold is a generalization of the notion of manifold that allows the presence of the points whose neighborhood is diffeomorphic to a quotient of R&quot;n&quot; by a finite group, i.e. R&quot;n&quot;/&quot;Γ&quot;. In physics, the notion of an orbifold usually describes an object that can be globally written as an orbit space &quot;M&quot;/&quot;G&quot; where &quot;M&quot; is a manifold (or a theory), and &quot;G&quot; is a group of its isometries (or symmetries) — not necessarily all of them. In string theory, these symmetries do not have to have a geometric interpretation.

A quantum field theory defined on an orbifold becomes singular near the fixed points of &quot;G&quot;. However string theory requires us to add new parts of the closed string Hilbert space — namely the twisted sectors where the fields defined on the closed strings are periodic up to an action from &quot;G&quot;. Orbifolding is therefore a general procedure of string theory to derive a new string theory from an old string theory in which the elements of &quot;G&quot; have been identified with the identity. Such a procedure reduces the number of states because the states must be invariant under &quot;G&quot;, but it also increases the number of states because of the extra twisted sectors. The result is usually a perfectly smooth, new string theory.

D-branes propagating on the orbifolds are described, at low energies, by gauge theories defined by the quiver diagrams. Open strings attached to these D-branes have no twisted sector, and so the number of open string states is reduced by the orbifolding procedure.

More specifically, when the orbifold group &quot;G&quot; is a discrete subgroup of spacetime isometries, then if it has no fixed point, the result is usually a compact smooth space; the twisted sector consists of closed strings wound around the compact dimension, which are called &quot;winding states&quot;.

When the orbifold group G is a discrete subgroup of spacetime isometries, and it has fixed points, then these usually have conical singularities, because R&quot;n&quot;/Z&quot;k&quot; has such a singularity at the fixed point of &quot;Z&quot;&quot;k&quot;. In string theory, gravitational singularities are usually a sign of extra degrees of freedom which are located at a locus point in spacetime. In the case of the orbifold these degrees of freedom are the twisted states, which are strings &quot;stuck&quot; at the fixed points. When the fields related with these twisted states acquire a non-zero vacuum expectation value, the singularity is deformed, i.e. the metric is changed and becomes regular at this point and around it. An example for a resulting geometry is the Eguchi–Hanson spacetime.

From the point of view of D-branes in the vicinity of the fixed points, the effective theory of the open strings attached to these D-branes is a supersymmetric field theory, whose space of vacua has a singular point, where additional massless degrees of freedom exist. The fields related with the closed string twisted sector couple to the open strings in such a way as to add a Fayet–Iliopoulos term to the supersymmetric field theory Lagrangian, so that when such a field acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value, the Fayet–Iliopoulos term is non-zero, and thereby deforms the theory (i.e. changes it) so that the singularity no longer exists , .

====Calabi–Yau manifolds====

In superstring theory,
the construction of realistic phenomenological models requires dimensional reduction because the strings naturally propagate in a 10-dimensional space whilst the observed dimension of space-time of the universe is 4. Formal constraints on the theories nevertheless place restrictions on the compactified space in which the extra &quot;hidden&quot; variables live: when looking for realistic 4-dimensional models with supersymmetry, the auxiliary compactified space must be a 6-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold.

There are a large number of possible Calabi–Yau manifolds (tens of thousands), hence the use of the term &quot;landscape&quot; in the current theoretical physics literature to describe the baffling choice. The general study of Calabi–Yau manifolds is mathematically complex and for a long time examples have been hard to construct explicitly. Orbifolds have therefore proved very useful since they automatically satisfy the constraints imposed by supersymmetry. They provide degenerate examples of Calabi–Yau manifolds due to their singular points, but this is completely acceptable from the point of view of theoretical physics. Such orbifolds are called &quot;supersymmetric&quot;: they are technically easier to study than general Calabi–Yau manifolds. It is very often possible to associate a continuous family of non-singular Calabi–Yau manifolds to a singular supersymmetric orbifold. In 4 dimensions this can be illustrated using complex K3 surfaces:

:*Every K3 surface admits 16 cycles of dimension 2 that are topologically equivalent to usual 2-spheres. Making the surface of these spheres tend to zero, the K3 surface develops 16 singularities. This limit represents a point on the boundary of the moduli space of K3 surfaces and corresponds to the orbifold formula_120 obtained by taking the quotient of the torus by the symmetry of inversion.

The study of Calabi–Yau manifolds in string theory and the duality between different models of string theory (type IIA and IIB) led to the idea of mirror symmetry in 1988. The role of orbifolds was first pointed out by Dixon, Harvey, Vafa and Witten around the same time.

===Music theory===
Beyond their manifold and various applications in mathematics and physics, orbifolds have been applied to music theory at least as early as 1985 in the work of Guerino Mazzola and later by Dmitri Tymoczko and collaborators. One of the papers of Tymoczko was the first music theory paper published by the journal &quot;Science.&quot; Mazzola and Tymoczko have participated in debate regarding their theories documented in a series of commentaries available at their respective web sites.


Tymoczko models musical chords consisting of &quot;n&quot; notes, which are not necessarily distinct, as points in the orbifold formula_121 – the space of &quot;n&quot; unordered points (not necessarily distinct) in the circle, realized as the quotient of the &quot;n&quot;-torus formula_122 (the space of &quot;n&quot; &quot;ordered&quot; points on the circle) by the symmetric group formula_123 (corresponding from moving from an ordered set to an unordered set).

Musically, this is explained as follows:
* Musical tones depend on the frequency (pitch) of their fundamental, and thus are parametrized by the positive real numbers, R+.
* Musical tones that differ by an octave (a doubling of frequency) are considered the same tone – this corresponds to taking the logarithm base 2 of frequencies (yielding the real numbers, as formula_124), then quotienting by the integers (corresponding to differing by some number of octaves), yielding a circle (as formula_125).
* Chords correspond to multiple tones without respect to order – thus &quot;t&quot; notes (with order) correspond to &quot;t&quot; ordered points on the circle, or equivalently a single point on the &quot;t&quot;-torus formula_126 and omitting order corresponds to taking the quotient by formula_127 yielding an orbifold.

For dyads (two tones), this yields the closed Möbius strip; for triads (three tones), this yields an orbifold that can be described as a triangular prism with the top and bottom triangular faces identified with a 120° twist (a twist) – equivalently, as a solid torus in 3 dimensions with a cross-section an equilateral triangle and such a twist.

The resulting orbifold is naturally stratified by repeated tones (properly, by integer partitions of &quot;t&quot;) – the open set consists of distinct tones (the partition formula_128), while there is a 1-dimensional singular set consisting of all tones being the same (the partition formula_129), which topologically is a circle, and various intermediate partitions. There is also a notable circle which runs through the center of the open set consisting of equally spaced points. In the case of triads, the three side faces of the prism correspond to two tones being the same and the third different (the partition formula_130), while the three edges of the prism correspond to the 1-dimensional singular set. The top and bottom faces are part of the open set, and only appear because the orbifold has been cut – if viewed as a triangular torus with a twist, these artifacts disappear.

Tymoczko argues that chords close to the center (with tones equally or almost equally spaced) form the basis of much of traditional Western harmony, and that visualizing them in this way assists in analysis. There are 4 chords on the center (equally spaced under equal temperament – spacing of 4/4/4 between tones), corresponding to the augmented triads (thought of as musical sets) C♯FA, DF♯A♯, D♯GB, and EG♯C (then they cycle: FAC♯ = C♯FA), with the 12 major chords and 12 minor chords being the points next to but not on the center – almost evenly spaced but not quite. Major chords correspond to 4/3/5 (or equivalently, 5/4/3) spacing, while minor chords correspond to 3/4/5 spacing. Key changes then correspond to movement between these points in the orbifold, with smoother changes effected by movement between nearby points.

<doc id="293506" wikidata="Q716662" url="?curid=293506" title="Hangul consonant and vowel tables">
<text>The following tables of consonants and vowels (&quot;jamo&quot;) of the Korean alphabet (&quot;Hangul&quot;) display (in blue) the basic forms in the first row and their derivatives in the following row(s). They are divided into initials (leading consonants), vowels (middle), and finals tables (trailing consonants).

The &quot;jamo&quot; shown below are individually romanized according to the Revised Romanization of Hangeul (&quot;RR Transliteration&quot;), which is a system of transliteration rules between the Korean and Roman alphabets, originating from South Korea. However, the tables below are not sufficient for normal transcription of the Korean language as the overarching &quot;Revised Romanization of Korean&quot; system takes contextual sound changes into account.

== Leading consonants ==
Called &quot;choseong&quot;, or &quot;initials&quot;, there are 19 initial consonants, whereof one (ㅇ) is silent, and five (ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ) are doubled:
== Medial vowels ==
Called &quot;jungseong&quot;, or &quot;vowels&quot;, there are 21 medial vowels:
== Trailing consonants ==
Called &quot;jongseong&quot;, or &quot;finals&quot;, there are 27 final consonants; with the additional case of &quot;no final consonant&quot;, there is a total of 28 possibilities:
== Collation ==
Several collation sequences are used to order words (like alphabetical sorting). The North and South differ on (a) the treatment of composite jamo consonants in syllable-leading (&quot;choseong&quot;) and -trailing (&quot;jongseong&quot;) position, and (b) on the treatment of composite jamo vowels in syllable-medial (&quot;jungseong&quot;) position.

This first sequence is official in South Korea (and is the basic binary order of codepoints in Unicode):
Sequences of this second type are common in North Korea:
== Letter names ==
=== Consonants ===

* Consonant names in the 15th century seem to have ended in a vowel (without adding the last consonant repeating a shortened version of the initial), judging from 1451 Hunmin Jeongeum Eonhae&#x27;s forms such as &quot;&quot;, which may have been pronounced &quot;geuneun&quot;.

=== Vowels ===
The &quot;names&quot; of the vowels are given according to the sound they make (their pronunciation). To be technical, the silent consonant would be added before the sound (e.g., ㅏ becomes 아).

==Hangul syllables==
With 19 possible initial consonants, 21 possible medial (one- or two-letter) vowels, and 28 possible final consonants (of which one corresponds to the case of no final consonant), there are a total of &quot;theoretically&quot; possible &quot;Korean syllable letters&quot; () which are contiguously encoded in the 11,172 Unicode code points from U+AC00 (Decimal: ) through U+D7A3 (Decimal: = 44,032 + 11,171) within the Hangul Syllables Unicode block. However, the majority of these theoretically possible syllables do not correspond to syllables found in actual Korean words or proper names.

<text>Sukhavati (IAST: &quot;Sukhāvatī&quot;; &quot;Blissful&quot;; Chinese: 極樂世界, lit. &quot;realm of ultimate bliss&quot;) is the pure land (or buddhafield) of the Buddha Amitābha in Mahayana Buddhism. Sukhavati is also called the Land of Bliss or Western Pure Land and is the most well-known of the Mahayana Buddhist pure lands due to the popularity of Pure Land Buddhism in East Asia. 

Sukhavati is also an important postmortem goal for Tibetan Buddhists, and is a common buddhafield used in the practice of phowa (&quot;transference of consciousness at the time of death&quot;). Sukhavati was widely depicted in Mahayana Buddhist art and remains an important theme in Buddhist art.

Different traditions understand the nature of Sukhavati differently. The Pure Land Buddhist traditions often sees it as a Samboghakaya pure land (this was the view of Shandao), while other traditions, like some Tibetan Buddhists, see it as a nirmanakaya Pure Land. Furthermore, in Chinese Buddhism, there are two views on Sukhavati (which are most often combined together): the view which sees Sukhavati as being a realm far away from ours (&quot;other-direction Pure Land&quot;) and the view which sees Sukhavati as non-dual with our world which only appears impure due to our minds (known as &quot;mind-only Pure Land&quot;).

== In Indian Mahayana sources ==
=== In the Pure Land Sutras ===
Sukhāvatī (&quot;Land of Bliss&quot;) is a major setting discussed in the &quot;Three Pure Land Sutras&quot;: &quot;Sutra of Amitayus&quot;, the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Amitabha Sutra&quot;. The &quot;Pratyutpanna-samādhi-sūtra&quot; is also an important source, particularly for early Chinese Pure Land.

The &quot;Larger Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot; is one of the primary texts that describe the Pure Land of Sukhavati. It details the story of Dharmakara, a bodhisattva who later becomes Amitabha Buddha. Dharmakara, made 48 vows, each describing the characteristics and conditions of his future Pure Land. His 18th vow, the Primal Vow, promises that anyone who sincerely wishes to be reborn in his Pure Land and calls upon his name even ten times will be reborn there, provided they have a genuine intention and do not harbor doubts.

This sutra extensively describes the Pure Land as a place of unimaginable beauty, with crystal-clear waters, jeweled trees, and golden ground. It is a world where suffering, old age, and death do not exist, and it is inhabited by bodhisattvas and beings on the path to enlightenment. The text emphasizes the ease of achieving rebirth in Sukhavati compared to striving for enlightenment in this world of samsara.
In the &quot;Smaller Sūtra&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Amitabha Sutra&quot;, Buddha Shakyamuni describes the Pure Land of Amitabha to his disciple Śāriputra. The Buddha speaks of the physical and spiritual splendor of Sukhavati, highlighting features such as the seven rows of balustrades, nets, and trees made of the seven precious jewels. He explains that those reborn in this Pure Land will experience perpetual joy and have access to the teachings of the Dharma at all times. This sutra emphasizes the practice of mindfulness of the Buddha (Buddhānusmṛti) as the means of attaining rebirth in Sukhavati.

&quot;The Amitayus Contemplation Sutra&quot; places greater emphasis on meditation and visualization practice. In this sutra, the Buddha teaches a queen called Vaidehi a series of 16 contemplations, beginning with visualizations of the setting sun, the Pure Land itself, and ultimately Amitabha Buddha and his attendant bodhisattvas, Avalokiteshvara and Mahasthamaprapta. Through these visualizations, practitioners are guided to focus their minds on the Pure Land and develop a connection with Amitabha, cultivating the aspiration for rebirth there.

=== In other Indian sources ===

Beyond the three primary Pure Land sutras, Sukhavati is also referenced in other Mahayana texts, though less extensively. Some key examples include:

* The &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot; mentions Sukhavati a few times. The very last section of the sutra, called the &quot;Aspiration Prayer of Samantabhadra (Bhadracarī),&quot; contains aspiration verses to be born in Sukhavati.
* &quot;The Lotus Sutra&quot; mentions Sukhavati. Avalokitesvara&#x27;s connection with Amitabha and Sukhavati is also mentioned in the Sanskrit edition and in the Tibetan edition of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;. These editions have some further passages which mention Amitabha Buddha as well (Hurvitz translation, p. 407).
* Sukhavati is mentioned once in the &quot;Pratyutpannasamādhi Sūtra&quot;
* Sukhavati is briefly mentioned in the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;
* &quot;Mahāmegha Sutra&quot; (&quot;The Great Cloud Sutra&quot;) &quot;-&quot; Chapter 38 contains a discussion of a goddess named Stainless Light who will in the future attain Buddhahood by being reborn in Sukhavati.
* The &quot;Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra&quot; mentions Sukhavati briefly, the passage says: &quot;The Victors emanating as results of the teaching, and those that are projections, all issue from the Blissful land of Infinite Light&quot;.
* The &quot;Māyopamasamādhi sūtra&quot;, named after the so called &quot;illusory absorption&quot;, a samadhi taught in Sukhavati. It discusses the origin myths of Avalokiteśvara and Mahā­sthāmaprāpta and explains how in the far future, after Amitabha manifests nirvana, Avalokiteśvara will take his place as the lord of Sukhavati.
* &quot;Samādhirāja sūtra&quot;, the sutra mentions Amitabha and Sukhāvatī in various places (e.g. chapter 33). It also states that whoever hears and upholds the &quot;samadhi&quot; in the sutra (which really refers to a text in this context) will go to Sukhāvatī.
* &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra&quot;
* Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on the Pure Land&quot; (&quot;Jìngtǔ lùn&quot; 浄土論), also known as The Rebirth Treatise (往生论), contains a description of Sukhavati in verse and a treatise on how to attain birth there.
Furthermore various Indian &quot;Dhāraṇī sutras&quot; (sutras focused on specific magical chants, incantations, recitations) state that reciting them will lead to birth in Sukhavati. These include: &quot;Amitabha Pure Land Rebirth Dhāraṇī, Uṣṇīṣavijayā Dhāraṇī Sutra, Dhāraṇī of Avalokiteśvara Ekadaśamukha Sūtra, Great Compassion Dhāraṇī Sutra, Sūtra of the Dhāraṇī of the King of the Sound of Amitābha’s Drum,&quot; and &quot;Mother of Avalokiteśvara Noble Dhāraṇī.&quot;

==Etymology and names==
The word is the feminine form of the Sanskrit word &quot;sukhāvat&quot; (&quot;full of joy; blissful&quot;), 
from &quot;sukha&quot; (&quot;delight, joy&quot;) and &quot;-vat&quot; (&quot;full of&quot;).

Sukhavati is known by different names in other languages. East Asian names are based on Chinese translations, and longer names may consist of the words &quot;Western&quot;, &quot;Blissful&quot; and &quot;Pure Land&quot; in various combinations. Some names and combinations are more popular in certain countries. Due to its importance, Sukhavati is often simply called &quot;The Pure Land&quot; without distinguishing it from other pure lands.
* Only common in Chinese.

==Buddhist funerals==
In Tibetan Buddhism, the world of Sukhavati is invoked during Buddhist funerals as a favorable destination for the deceased. Such rituals are often accompanied with the tantric technique of &quot;phowa&quot; (&quot;transference of consciousness&quot;) to the pure land of Amitābha, performed by a lama on the behalf of the departed. Halkias (2013:148) explains that
&quot;Sukhavati features in funeral rites and scriptures dedicated to the ritual care of the dead (&quot;&#x27;das-mchod&quot;). The structure and performance of Tibetan death ceremonies varies according to a set sequence of events...For the duration of these rites, the consciousness of the dead is coaxed into increasing levels of clarity until the time for the ritual transference to Sukhavati.&quot;

 in Japanese Buddhism is the appearance of the Amida on a &quot;purple&quot; cloud (紫雲) at the time of one&#x27;s death. The most popular belief is that the soul would then depart to the Western Paradise. A number of hanging scroll paintings depict the western paradise.

==Namesakes==
A number of temples are named after Sukhāvatī:

* Kek Look Seah, Malaysia
* Jile Temple, Harbin, China
* Shinshōgokuraku-ji, Kyoto, Japan

<doc id="293511" wikidata="Q911268" url="?curid=293511" title="D'Alembert operator">
<text>In special relativity, electromagnetism and wave theory, the d&#x27;Alembert operator (denoted by a box: formula_1), also called the d&#x27;Alembertian, wave operator, box operator or sometimes quabla operator (&quot;cf&quot;. nabla symbol) is the Laplace operator of Minkowski space. The operator is named after French mathematician and physicist Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert.

In Minkowski space, in standard coordinates , it has the form
: formula_2

Here formula_3 is the 3-dimensional Laplacian and is the inverse Minkowski metric with 
:formula_4, formula_5, formula_6 for formula_7.
Note that the and summation indices range from 0 to 3: see Einstein notation. 

(Some authors alternatively use the negative metric signature of , with formula_8.)

Lorentz transformations leave the Minkowski metric invariant, so the d&#x27;Alembertian yields a Lorentz scalar. The above coordinate expressions remain valid for the standard coordinates in every inertial frame.

==The box symbol and alternate notations==
There are a variety of notations for the d&#x27;Alembertian. The most common are the &quot;box&quot; symbol formula_1 (Unicode: ) whose four sides represent the four dimensions of space-time and the &quot;box-squared&quot; symbol formula_10 which emphasizes the scalar property through the squared term (much like the Laplacian). In keeping with the triangular notation for the Laplacian, sometimes formula_11 is used.

Another way to write the d&#x27;Alembertian in flat standard coordinates is formula_12. This notation is used extensively in quantum field theory, where partial derivatives are usually indexed, so the lack of an index with the squared partial derivative signals the presence of the d&#x27;Alembertian.

Sometimes the box symbol is used to represent the four-dimensional Levi-Civita covariant derivative. The symbol formula_13 is then used to represent the space derivatives, but this is coordinate chart dependent.

==Applications==
The wave equation for small vibrations is of the form 
:formula_14
where is the displacement.

The wave equation for the electromagnetic field in vacuum is
:formula_15
where is the electromagnetic four-potential in Lorenz gauge.

The Klein–Gordon equation has the form
:formula_16

==Green&#x27;s function==
The Green&#x27;s function, formula_17, for the d&#x27;Alembertian is defined by the equation 
:formula_18

where formula_19 is the multidimensional Dirac delta function and formula_20 and formula_21 are two points in Minkowski space.

A special solution is given by the &quot;retarded Green&#x27;s function&quot; which corresponds to signal propagation only forward in time
:formula_22

where formula_23 is the Heaviside step function.

<doc id="293513" wikidata="Q6909096" url="?curid=293513" title="Moral clarity">
<text>Moral clarity is a catchphrase associated with American political conservatives. Popularized by William J. Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Why We Fight: Moral Clarity and the War on Terrorism&quot;, the phrase was first used in its current context during the 1980s, in reference to the politics of Ronald Reagan.

The phrase &quot;moral clarity&quot; encodes a complex political argument that includes all of the following claims:

* The War on Terrorism, like some previous wars involving the United States (particularly World War II and the Cold War), is a conflict between good and evil.
* Traditional American values like democracy and freedom are universal human rights, worth promoting and defending through military intervention.
* Attempts to understand or explain the actions of anti-Western terrorists as justifiable responses to actions of the United States or Israel are a sign of moral weakness at best, and sympathy for the terrorists at worst, and will hamper efforts to defeat them.
* Though the actions of the United States and its allies may lead to civilian deaths or other forms of collateral damage, may require the use of means such as torture that would be condemned in other contexts, and may involve temporary alliances with undemocratic regimes, these actions are justified by the greater moral necessity of defeating terrorism and thus promoting American values and ensuring long-term U.S. security.
* Opponents of action against terrorists are guilty of promoting moral relativism or moral equivalence, in which the allegedly similar means of both anti-terrorists and terrorists are used to blur the moral differences between good and evil.

==Opposing views==
For opponents of the notion of &quot;moral clarity&quot;, dividing the world into good and evil does not lend itself to a workable foreign policy. For example, if Iraq was invaded for reasons of &quot;moral clarity&quot;, it follows that other &quot;rogue states&quot; (like North Korea) would also be similarly attacked. This apparent contradiction is used to argue that proponents of &quot;moral clarity&quot; are guilty of hypocrisy or special pleading, and that the slogan &quot;moral clarity&quot; masks less exalted reasons for military intervention, particularly economic motives.

Opponents of the notion of &quot;moral clarity&quot; also note that organizations such as al Qaida and neo-Nazis also believe that their own point of view is one of &quot;moral clarity&quot;, which justifies them to take whatever action they feel necessary against what they see as the &quot;forces of evil&quot;. Thus, opponents of the notion of &quot;moral clarity&quot; assert that, but for the accident of their country and culture of birth, the proponents of &quot;moral clarity&quot; might well be on the opposite side, holding the same views. Proponents of this view argue that understanding the motivations and values of other cultures, rather than labeling them &quot;evil&quot;, is a better first step in eliminating violence.

Critics also argue that &quot;moral clarity&quot; promotes a dangerous view expressed in the famous phrase . The idea that the United States is always &quot;good&quot; is actually an argument of moral relativism, they say, since it makes no distinction between right and wrong actions. Furthermore, it is argued that &quot;moral clarity&quot; is used to discredit those who want to hold the United States to a higher moral standard than &quot;My country, right or wrong&quot;, a standard expressed by U.S. Brigadier General Carl Schurz: &quot;Our country right or wrong. When right, to be kept right; when wrong, to be put right.&quot;

* Useful idiot – disparaging term for Americans who purportedly lack &quot;moral clarity&quot;

<text>Poros (; ) is a small Greek island-pair in the southern part of the Saronic Gulf, about south of the port of Piraeus and separated from the Peloponnese by a wide sea channel, with the town of Galatas on the mainland across the strait. Its surface area is about and it has 3,261 inhabitants (2021). The ancient name of Poros was Pogon. Like other ports in the Saronic, it is a popular weekend destination for Athenian travellers.

Poros consists of two islands: Sphaeria (, ), the southern part, which is of volcanic origin, where today&#x27;s city is located, and Kalaureia (, ), also Kalavria or Calauria (meaning &#x27;gentle breeze&#x27;), the northern and largest part. A bridge connects the two islands over a narrow strait.

Poros is an island with rich vegetation. Much of the northern and far eastern/western sides of the island are bushy, whereas large areas of old pine forest are found in the south and center of the island. It has a good road network and adequate tourist infrastructure, which makes it a popular resort for short holidays.

==Geography==

The land area of the municipality is . This includes the islands and part of the adjacent Peloponnese coast, adjacent to Galatas, Thermisia and the island of Hydra. The landscape is very hilly and mountainous. The highest peak is the Vigla (358 m) in the west-central part. Following the island&#x27;s topography and geology, small creeks and seasonal streams flow through steep valleys of the southern and northeastern part. The western and northern part of the island feature smooth hills and shallow valleys. Sandy beaches are restricted to the southern shore of the island, except for a bay in the northern part called Vayionia.

Poros contains the main village Poros and the smaller villages Ágios Nektários and Kyaní Aktí.

===Geology===
The geology of the island comprises Mesozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary rocks (limestone, and Flysch-type sandstone) and ophiolites, as well as Neogene volcanic rocks on Sferia. The island is tectonically dissected and part of a Tertiary tectonic mélange. There are karstic sinkholes in the island&#x27;s central limestone massif, and limestone caves with stalactites. Visible marine fossils are mainly found in the limestone, no occurrences of precious stones or ore deposits are known.

Limestone from Poros, an example of the poros stone, was an important component in the construction of Mycenaean &quot;tholos&quot; tombs in the Late Bronze Age, being used particularly for monuments at Mycenae, including the Tomb of Aegisthus.

==History==
In the northeastern part of the island, in a location called “Kavos Vasili”, the archaeologists have discovered the ruins of a settlement of the Early Bronze Age. This settlement is the oldest of the wider area of Trizinia, Peloponnese, and is believed to be interrelated with the wreck found on the nearby Dokos island which dates to the same period.

===Antiquity===


Poros was divided into two islands during antiquity: Sphairia (also known by its modern Greek form Sfairia) and Calauria (also known by its ancient Greek form Kalaureia and its modern Greek form Kalavria). Sphairia consisted of the area of the modern island which includes its current capital. Calauria was the larger part of the island to its north. During the period of Mycenaean dominance (1400-1100 BC) Calauria was quite powerful and the most important naval base of region was located on islet Monti or Liontari on its eastern coast. The city-state of Calauria was home to an asylum dedicated to Poseidon, the ruins of which are still accessible on a hilltop close to the town. This asylum may have been linked to the sanctuaries at Geraistos and Tainaros. Ancient historians stated that Calauria was the center of an amphictyony, a religious alliance between its city-state and those of Athens, Poros, Aegina, Epidaurus, Hermione, Troezen, Nauplio, Orchomenus, and Prasaiai. Modern archaeology has discovered no evidence for its actual existence, however, and now believe the &quot;Calaurian League&quot; to have been a later Hellenistic invention. An enormous feast was found dating to the Hellenistic period in the ruins of the Calaurian asylum, along with a plaque celebrating the &quot;revival&quot; of its amphictyony.

During the 5th century, the Persian Empire annexed the Greek cities of western Anatolia. When the Athenians helped these cities in a revolt against Persian rule, Poros, along with the other Greek states of mainland Greece and the Aegean islands, was drawn into the Greco-Persian Wars. At the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, Troezen and Calauria offered asylum to an anti-Macedonian politician who eventually became the tyrant of the region. After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, the Ptolemies of Egypt occupied Calauria. Around the same time, the Athenian orator Demosthenes came to the island, where some report his suicide. In 273 BC, the last explosion of the Methana volcano dramatically changed the morphology of Poros and the wider region.

The Sanctuary of Poseidon has been excavated by Swedish archaeologists. The 1894 field season is considered to be the first Swedish archaeological campaign in Greece. Swedes have continued excavations from 1997 in collaboration with the Greek National Heritage Board.

===Roman and Byzantine times===

During the Roman period (86 BC to 395 AD) Poros was part of the Roman Empire along with Trizina, to which it was a tributary. 
In Byzantine times, Poros and other islands were often raided by the pirates that dominated the Aegean Sea.

===Venetian period===
In 1484 the Venetians occupied Poros and used it as a strategic port in their sea battles with the Ottomans. Poros was the most powerful city of the wider area, also governing Methana Island, Epidaurus, Damalas (Trizina), Fanari and Valario. During that time, the island had about 15,000 inhabitants, making it one of the largest cities in Greece. Arvanites were recorded among the inhabitants of the island in 1688. They lived in poverty as most did in Greece at the time. Venetian rule ended in 1715.

===Ottoman period===
The Ottoman Period began in 1715, much later in Poros than in the rest of Greece. Shipping and commerce were the inhabitants&#x27; main activities, but Poros&#x27; fleet wasn&#x27;t as famous as Hydra&#x27;s or Spetses&#x27; fleet, and did not participate in many sea battles.

===The Greek Revolution===

Poros had an important role during the Greek Revolution in 1821, due to its strategic position. The Greek revolutionary leaders, often met in Poros to discuss and plan their future actions. The first Greek naval base was established in Poros in 1828 and remained there until 1878. In September 1828, the ambassadors of England, France and Russia met in Poros with Ioannis Kapodistrias in order to determine the borders of the future Greek state, which was established two years later, in 1830.

===Russian naval base===
With the Treaty of Kuchuk Kainarji, Russia secured free shipping for its navy, war and merchant alike, throughout the waters of the Ottoman Empire. As Russian naval activity grew, need arose for a supply station, and land was acquired at the edge of Poros town. Extensive materiel, coal, and food storage facilities were built, as well as a hardtack baking factory. After Greek independence, Governor Capodistrias requisitioned the facilities for use of the Greek war navy, and offered the Russians an alternative location in a nearby cove. The new facilities were far larger, and were used by Russian ships throughout the 19th century. The number of Russian residents of Poros increased and even a Russian school was established. Then as Russian naval activity declined, so did the base and by the early 20th century only a single Russian watchman was left guarding it. It was then granted to the Greek Navy by the Czar but was never put to actual use, and the abandoned buildings were left to decay. The ruins, in elaborately carved stone, were listed as protected architectural monuments in 1989.

===Twentieth century===
In the beginning of the 20th century, among the activities of the Poros&#x27; inhabitants were agriculture (mainly wheat, grapevines and olives), livestock, fishing and shipping.

==Main sights==

*The town of Poros, with its neoclassical edifices, is built amphitheatrically on the slopes of a hill. Its most famous landmark is a clock tower built in 1927.
*The Archaeological Museum of Poros, at Korizis Square, houses findings from the Sanctuary of Poseidon, from ancient Troizen, and from other archaeological sites nearby.
*In the northern part of the island are the remains of the Sanctuary of Poseidon, the centre of the Kalaureian amphictyony. The exact date it was built is not known, although researchers estimate it to have been around 520 BC. The dimensions of the temple, which is of the Doric order, are 27.4×14.4 m. There are six columns on each short side and twelve on each long side. It was here that Demosthenes, the famous orator, poisoned himself with hemlock in 322 BC fleeing from the Macedonian Governor Antipatros.
*Poros was the site of the first naval base in modern Greece, established in 1827 during the Greek War of Independence. Most of the activities of Poros naval base were moved to Salamis Naval Base in 1881. The site is still used today by the Hellenic Navy as a training centre for naval personnel.
*Bourtzi castle. It was built by von Heideck at around 1828, at the place where an old church of St. Constantine had stood. The island was given to the Poros monastery from 1770 on, by Antonios Serfos. The stand-off between Hydra island and Capodistrias was the cause for heavy fighting here in 1831.
*Poros Shell Museum. Founded in 2006, a permanent exhibition, Shells from the Greek Seas, is displayed at the Chatzopouleios Library. More info can be found on the webpage.
*The Holy Monastery of Zoodochos Pigi, founded in 1720 AD, is located 4 km east of the main city of Poros island. It is built on the slope of a pine forest. In 1814, a group of monks from Mount Athos took refuge in this monastery. A few years later, these monks founded the Zoodochos Pigi Monastery at Longovarda on Paros. Katholiko is a basilica with a dome and a tower-like belfry being the main church of the monastery.

==Historical population==
==Notable people==
*Alexandros Koryzis (1885–1941), Prime Minister of Greece. A museum is Poros is dedicated to his life.
*Minos Kyriakou (1942–2017), Greek billionaire businessman
*Henry Miller (1891–1980), American writer wrote about Poros in &quot;The Colossus of Maroussi&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t know which affected me more deeply-the story of the lemon groves just opposite us or the sight of Poros itself when suddenly I realized we were sailing through the streets. If there is one dream which I like above all others it is that of sailing on land. Coming into Poros gives the illusion of the deep dream. Suddenly the land converges on all sides and the boat is squeezed into a narrow strait from which there is no egress. The men and women of Poros are hanging out of the windows just above your head. You pull in right under their frosty nostrils, as though for a shave and a haircut en route. The loungers on the quay are walking with the same speed as the boat. They can walk faster than the boat if they choose to quicken their pace.&quot;
*Other prominent literary people have written about the beauty of Poros such as the Nobel laureate Giorgos Seferis, Kosmas Politis, Kostis Palamas, and Ιoulia Dragoumi.

==Transportation==

Poros is linked to mainland Greece by a car ferry to Galatas. Poros has no airport but is easily accessible from Athens by ferry or hydrofoil.

== Plot ==

In Winter River, Connecticut, Adam and Barbara Maitland are spending their vacation decorating their large country home that local real estate agent Jane Butterfield constantly pesters them to sell. As a hobby, Adam is building a scale model of the town in the attic. While driving home from town, the Maitlands’ car plunges off a bridge and into the river. Barbara and Adam arrive home but are unable to recall how they got there. When attempting to leave the house, Adam enters an otherworldly desert-like landscape populated by enormous sandworms. The encounter lasts mere seconds for him, but after Barbara rescues him, she claims he was gone for an hour. After discovering a &quot;Handbook for the Recently Deceased&quot; and noticing they have no reflections in a mirror, the couple realizes that they drowned in the river and are ghosts.

The house is sold to New York real estate developer Charles Deetz and his second wife Delia, a talentless sculptor. Charles&#x27; teenage goth daughter, Lydia lives with them. Under the guidance of interior designer Otho, Delia begins renovating the house with a new-wave aesthetic of postmodern art.

While consulting the &quot;Handbook&quot; on how to eject the Deetzes, the Maitlands see an advertisement for &#x27;Betelgeuse&#x27;. Following the handbook&#x27;s guidelines, they travel to an otherworldly waiting room filled with other distressed souls. After navigating the afterlife&#x27;s complex bureaucracy, the Maitlands return home only to realize three months have passed and the house has been completely redesigned. Their caseworker Juno arrives and discloses the Maitlands must remain in their house for 125 years before &quot;moving on&quot;. Juno discourages them from contacting Betelgeuse, her former assistant and now a freelance &#x27;bio-exorcist&#x27;, to drive out the Deetzes. Betelgeuse can only be summoned by uttering his name three times. Juno recommends that the Maitlands haunt the Deetzes themselves.

Adam and Barbara are invisible to Charles and Delia, which thwarts their fright attempts. Lydia, however, can see them, which she attributes to her peculiar nature. The Maitlands invoke Betelgeuse and are transported into the model. Betelgeuse&#x27;s crude and morbid demeanor is offensive and they exit the model. The Maitlands possess Charles, Delia, and their wealthy friends during a dinner party. Unexpectedly, their antics only amuse the group, inspiring Charles to pitch a supernatural theme park to investor Maxie Dean. The Deetzes uncover the town model in the attic, where Otho finds the Maitlands&#x27; &quot;Handbook&quot;. Betelgeuse transforms into a giant snake and terrorizes the Deetzes before Barbara banishes him back to the town model.

Juno calls Barbara and Adam back to the afterlife office and berates them for releasing Betelgeuse. Meanwhile, Lydia, depressed and blaming the Maitlands for Betelgeuse&#x27;s attack, writes a suicide note. Lydia discovers Betelgeuse inside the model. She almost summons him in exchange for passage to the afterlife, but the Maitlands return and stop her. 

Maxie Dean arrives and demands evidence of paranormal occurrences, but the Maitlands refuse to manifest again. Otho uses the &quot;Handbook&quot; and conducts what he believes is a séance. He summons Adam and Barbara by using their wedding clothes, but they begin aging and decaying rapidly as Otho has mistakenly performed an exorcism.

A horrified Lydia invokes Betelgeuse, who will help if she marries him so he can remain in the mortal world. He saves the Maitlands, drives away Otho and the Deans, then prepares to wed Lydia. The Maitlands attempt to banish Betelgeuse, who teleports Adam to the town model and Barbara to the desert-land. Barbara rides back into the house on a sandworm, which devours Betelgeuse.

The Deetzes and the Maitlands agree to harmoniously live together, and the Maitlands are close to Lydia. Betelgeuse is seen sitting in the afterlife waiting room, waiting his turn to see a caseworker. When he attempts to steal a witch doctor ghost&#x27;s numbered ticket, his head is shrunk.

=== Writing===
After the financial success of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; (1985), Burton became a &quot;bankable&quot; director and began working on a script for &quot;Batman&quot; with Sam Hamm. While Warner Bros. was willing to pay for the script&#x27;s development, it was less willing to green-light &quot;Batman&quot;. Burton had become disheartened by the lack of imagination and originality in the scripts he had been sent, particularly &quot;Hot to Trot&quot;.

Michael McDowell and Larry Wilson formed a partnership (Pecos Productions) with entertainment attorney Michael Bender, and &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; was their first original project. After developing the story, McDowell and Wilson decided they would write the first draft of the screenplay together, while Wilson would only take &#x27;Story By&#x27; credit, as well as his &#x27;Producer&#x27; credit.

Burton had gotten to know and worked with McDowell and Wilson (who co-wrote the script for &quot;The Jar&quot;, an episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; that Burton directed). Burton read their first draft of &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, liked it but had other projects that kept him from becoming involved at that time.

The original script is far less comedic and much darker; the Maitlands&#x27; car crash is depicted graphically, with Barbara&#x27;s arm crushed and the couple screaming for help as they slowly drown. A reference to this remains: Barbara remarks that her arm feels frozen upon returning home as a ghost. Instead of possessing the Deetzes and forcing them to dance during dinner, the Maitlands cause a vine-patterned carpet to come to life and attack them by tangling them to their chairs.

The character of Betelgeuse—envisioned in the first draft as a winged demon who takes on the form of a short man—is also intent on killing the Deetzes rather than scaring them and wants sex from Lydia instead of marriage. In this version of the script, Betelgeuse need only be exhumed from his grave to be summoned, after which he is free to wreak havoc; he can be summoned, but not controlled, by saying his name three times and wanders the world freely, tormenting different characters in different manifestations.

In another version of the script, the film concludes with the Maitlands, Deetzes, and Otho conducting an exorcism ritual that destroys Betelgeuse, and the Maitlands transforming into miniature versions of themselves and moving into Adam&#x27;s model of their home, which they refurbish to look like their house before the Deetzes moved in.

Co-author and producer Larry Wilson has talked about the reaction to the first draft by a prominent executive at Universal, where Wilson was employed at the time:

Skaaren&#x27;s rewrite shifted the film&#x27;s tone, eliminating the graphic nature of the Maitlands&#x27; deaths and further developing the concept created by McDowell and Wilson that the Afterlife is a complex bureaucracy. Skaaren&#x27;s rewrite also added to McDowell and Wilson&#x27;s depiction of the limbo that keeps Barbara and Adam trapped inside their home; in the original script, it takes the form of a massive void filled with giant clock gears that shred the fabric of time and space as they move. Skaaren had Barbara and Adam encounter different limbos every time they leave their home, including the &quot;clock world&quot; and the sandworm world, identified as Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. Skaaren also introduced the &quot;leitmotif&quot; of music accompanying Barbara and Adam&#x27;s ghostly hijinks, although his script specified R&amp;B tunes instead of Harry Belafonte and was to have concluded with Lydia dancing to &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot;.

Skaaren&#x27;s first draft retained some of McDowell&#x27;s Betelgeuse&#x27;s more sinister characteristics but toned the character down to make him a troublesome pervert rather than blatantly murderous. Betelgeuse&#x27;s true form was that of the Middle Eastern man, and much of his dialogue was written in African-American Vernacular English. This version concluded with the Deetzes returning to New York and leaving Lydia in the care of the Maitlands, who, with Lydia&#x27;s help, transform their home&#x27;s exterior into a stereotypical haunted house while returning the interior to its previous state. It also featured deleted scenes such as the real estate agent, Jane, trying to convince the Deetzes to allow her to sell the house for them (having sold it to them in the first place—Charles and Delia decline) and a revelation of how Betelgeuse had died centuries earlier (he attempted to hang himself while drunk—having been rejected by a woman—only to mess it up and die slowly by choking to death rather than quickly by snapping his neck) and wound up working for Juno before striking out on his own as a &quot;freelance bio-exorcist&quot;.

Retrospectively, McDowell was impressed with how many people made the connection between the film&#x27;s title and the star Betelgeuse.

=== Casting ===
Burton&#x27;s original choice for Betelgeuse was Sammy Davis Jr. The producers also considered Dudley Moore and Sam Kinison for the role, but Geffen suggested Keaton. Burton was unfamiliar with Keaton&#x27;s work, but was quickly convinced. Several actresses auditioned for the role of Lydia Deetz, including Sarah Jessica Parker, Brooke Shields, Lori Loughlin, Diane Lane, Justine Bateman, Molly Ringwald, Juliette Lewis, and Jennifer Connelly. Alyssa Milano was the runner-up for the role. Burton cast Ryder upon seeing her in &quot;Lucas&quot;. Anjelica Huston was originally cast as Delia Deetz but dropped out because of illness. O&#x27;Hara quickly signed on, while Burton claimed it took a lot of time to convince other cast members to sign, as &quot;they didn&#x27;t know what to think of the weird script&quot;. Burton also felt that O&#x27;Hara and Jones would make a &quot;cute couple&quot;. Lydia Deetz was notably cast with the look and persona of the Goth subculture.

=== Filming ===
&quot;Beetlejuice&quot;″s budget was $15 million, with just $1 million given over to visual effects work. Considering the scale and scope of the effects, which included stop motion, replacement animation, prosthetic makeup, puppetry and blue screen, it was always Burton&#x27;s intention to make the style similar to that of the B movies he grew up with as a child. He said that he wanted to make the effects look cheap and purposely fake-looking. Burton wanted to hire Anton Furst as production designer after being impressed with his work on &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; (1984) and &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987), but Furst was committed to &quot;High Spirits&quot;, a choice he later regretted. He hired Bo Welch, his future collaborator on &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. The test screenings were met with positive feedback and prompted Burton to film an epilogue featuring Betelgeuse foolishly angering a witch doctor. Warner Bros. disliked the title &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and wanted to call the film &quot;House Ghosts&quot;. As a joke, Burton suggested the name &quot;Scared Sheetless&quot; and was horrified when the studio actually considered using it. While the setting is the fictional village of Winter River, Connecticut, all outdoor scenes were filmed in East Corinth, a village in the town of Corinth, Vermont. Interiors were filmed at The Culver Studios in Culver City, California. Principal photography took place from March 11 to June 11, 1987.

=== Music ===

The &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; soundtrack, first released in 1988 on LP, CD, and cassette tape, features most of the film&#x27;s score, written and arranged by Danny Elfman. Geffen reissued the original 1988 soundtrack on vinyl in 2015, which was remastered and pressed to vinyl by Waxwork Records in 2019 for the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The soundtrack features two original recordings performed by Harry Belafonte used in the film: &quot;Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)&quot; and &quot;Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)&quot;. Two other vintage Belafonte recordings that appear in the film are absent from the soundtrack: &quot;Man Smart, Woman Smarter&quot; and &quot;Sweetheart from Venezuela&quot;. The soundtrack entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart the week ending June 25, 1988, at No. 145, peaking two weeks later at No. 118 and spending a total of six weeks on the chart. This was after the film had already fallen out of the top 10 and before the video release in October. &quot;Day-O&quot; received a fair amount of airplay at the time in support of the soundtrack.

The complete score (with the Belafonte tracks included) was released in both the DVD and the Blu-ray as an isolated music track in the audio settings menu; this version of the audio track consists entirely of &quot;clean&quot; musical cues, uninterrupted by dialogue or sound effects.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Beetlejuice&quot; opened theatrically in the United States on March 30, 1988, earning $8,030,897 its opening weekend, which at the time, was an Easter weekend record. The film eventually grossed $75.1 million worldwide. &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; was a financial success, recouping its $15 million budget and becoming the 10th-highest-grossing film of 1988.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Beetlejuice&quot; was met with a mostly positive response. Based on reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; holds an overall approval rating with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Brilliantly bizarre and overflowing with ideas, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; offers some of Michael Keaton&#x27;s most deliciously manic work—and creepy, funny fun for the whole family.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 19 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a B on a grade scale of A to F.

Pauline Kael called the film a &quot;comedy classic&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum called it a &quot;creative mess&quot; in a positive review in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; had the &quot;perfect&quot; balance of bizarreness, comedy and horror.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, writing that the film &quot;tries anything and everything for effect, and only occasionally manages something marginally funny&quot; and &quot;is about as funny as a shrunken head&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, writing that he &quot;would have been more interested if the screenplay had preserved their [Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis] sweet romanticism and cut back on the slapstick&quot;. Ebert called Keaton &quot;unrecognizable behind pounds of makeup&quot; and said &quot;his scenes don&#x27;t seem to fit with the other action&quot;.

In his book &quot;Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914–2008&quot;, Bruce G. Hallenbeck praised the film&#x27;s lively script, assured direction, offbeat casting, and &quot;delightfully off-kilter, Edward Gorey-like look&quot;, citing the explorer with the shrunken head and the animated sandworm as particularly memorable visuals.

=== Accolades ===
At the 61st Academy Awards, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Makeup (Steve La Porte, Ve Neill, and Robert Short), while the British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominated the film for Best Visual Effects and Makeup at the 42nd British Academy Film Awards.

&quot;Beetlejuice&quot; won Best Horror Film and Best Make-up at the 1988 Saturn Awards. Sidney also won the Saturn for Best Supporting Actress, and the film received five other nominations: Direction for Burton, Writing for McDowell and Skaaren, Best Supporting Actor for Keaton, Music for Elfman, and Special Effects. &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; was 88th in the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of Best Comedies.

== Sequel ==

A sequel, &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot;, produced by Brad Pitt&#x27;s studio Plan B Entertainment alongside Warner Bros., with Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder, and Catherine O&#x27;Hara reprising their roles, was released in theaters on September 6, 2024.

== In other media ==
The film&#x27;s success spawned an animated television series, video games and a 2018 stage musical.

=== Video rental ===
On March 10, 1998, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; became the first of more than 5.2 billion DVDs shipped by Netflix, which launched as a mail-based rental business.

<doc id="293526" wikidata="Q2891304" url="?curid=293526" title="Dual loyalty">
<text>In politics, dual loyalty is loyalty to two separate interests that potentially conflict with each other, leading to a conflict of interest.

==Historical examples==
Other historical examples of actual or perceived &quot;dual loyalty&quot; include the following:
* During World War II, a number of United States citizens of Japanese, German, and Italian ancestry, including some born in the U.S., were confined to internment camps (see Internment of Japanese Americans).
* Roman Catholics are subject to the Pope on religious matters. This has often perceived as dual loyalty by powers opposed to the Holy See.
** During the English Reformation, many important English and Scottish Catholics, such as Thomas More, Mary, Queen of Scots and Edmund Campion, were tried and executed for their alleged double loyalty to the Papacy and infidelity to the Crown.
** During John F. Kennedy&#x27;s campaign for and brief tenure as U.S. President, some opponents questioned whether a Roman Catholic President of the United States had a divided loyalty with respect to the Papacy and Vatican City.
** Chinese Catholics have been forced by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China of substituting the Roman Catholic Church in China by the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association.
* Jews who were part of the Jewish diaspora have been accused of dual loyalty by the Romans in the 1st century, by the French in the Dreyfus Affair in the late 19th century, and in Stalin-era Soviet Union in the 20th century. Before the creation of Israel, Jewish anti-Zionists used the accusation against other Jews. While today some use the phrase in a &quot;neutral and non-pejorative fashion,&quot; John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt say this use can obscure the fact that home nations and Israel may have sharp political differences. The 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq lead to such accusations against Jewish neoconservatives, vocal proponents of war against Iraq who were alleged by some critics of the Iraq War to have sought to undermine Arab nations hostile to Israel (e.g., by the term &quot;Israel-firster&quot;).
* The loyalty of many Americans to the U.S. government was called into question during the Cold War due to alleged Communist sympathies, resulting in &quot;witch-hunts&quot; of various government officials, celebrities and other citizens (see McCarthyism).
* Muslims living in Western countries, especially during periods of heightened tensions between Muslim minorities and non-Muslims, such as after September 11, 2001, or during the Jyllands-Posten cartoons controversy of 2005–2006, are sometimes accused of being more loyal to the Muslim ummah than to their country.
* &quot;Dual loyalty&quot; continues to be a concern of critics of US immigration policy, particularly in those states which border Mexico.
* The Hindu minority in the majority-Muslim Bangladesh has often been accused of dual loyalty to the neighbour state of India by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and even by Sheikh Hasina who heads the largest political outfit in Bangladesh hailing secularism.
*The Ahmadiyya movement in Islam has been accused by some Muslims of dual loyalty to the state of Israel, or less frequently the Hindu-majority state of India.
* The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has accused the Baháʼí Faith minority of having loyalty to foreign powers (see Iranian anti-Baháʼí conspiracy theories).
*During the impeachment of Donald Trump in 2020, some Republican Members of Congress accused Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Vindman of dual loyalty towards Ukraine due to his Ukrainian heritage.

==Transnationalist interpretations==
Some scholars refer to a growing trend of transnationalism and suggest that as societies become more heterogeneous and multicultural, the term &quot;dual loyalty&quot; had increasingly become a meaningless bromide. According to the theory of transnationalism, migration and other factors, including improved global communication, produce new forms of identity that transcend traditional notions of physical and cultural space. Nina Glick Schiller, Linda Basch, and Cristina Blanc-Szanton define a process by which immigrants &quot;link together&quot; their country of origin and their country of settlement.

The transnationalist view is that &quot;dual loyalty&quot; is a potentially-positive expression of multi-culturalism and can contribute to the diversity and strength of civil society. That view is popular in many academic circles, but others are skeptical of the idea. As one paper describes it,
Beyond its usage in particular instances, the terms &quot;dual loyalty&quot; and &quot;transnationalism&quot; continue to be the subject of much debate. As one academic wrote:

<doc id="293530" wikidata="Q679189" url="?curid=293530" title="Carlism">
<text>Carlism (; ; ; ) is a Traditionalist and Legitimist political movement in Spain aimed at establishing an alternative branch of the Bourbon dynasty, one descended from Don Carlos, Count of Molina (1788–1855), on the Spanish throne.

The movement was founded as a consequence of an early 19th-century dispute over the succession of the Spanish monarchy and widespread dissatisfaction with the Alfonsine line of the House of Bourbon, and subsequently found itself becoming a notable element of Spanish conservatism in its 19th-century struggle against liberalism, which repeatedly broke out into military conflicts known as the Carlist Wars.

It was at its strongest in the 1830s but experienced a revival following Spain&#x27;s defeat in the Spanish–American War in 1898, when the Spanish Empire lost its last remaining significant overseas territories of the Philippines, Cuba, Guam, and Puerto Rico to the United States.

Carlism continued to play a notable role in the 20th century as part of the Nationalist faction in the Spanish Civil War and the subsequently triumphant Francoist regime until the Spanish transition to democracy in 1975. Carlism continues to survive as a minor party:


==Origins==

===Dynastic issue===
====Systems of succession in dispute====
Traditionally, all but one of the Spanish kingdoms allowed the succession of daughters in the absence of sons and of sisters in the absence of brothers (male-preference primogeniture). The one exception, Aragon, tended to favour semi-Salicism. The most elaborate rules formed the &quot;Seven-part code&quot; (&quot;Siete partidas&quot;) of the late 13th century.

On 1 November 1700 a French Bourbon prince, Philip V, acceded to the Spanish throne. In the French royal house, Salic law applied, which did not permit female succession. Accordingly, the traditional Spanish order of succession had to give way to a semi-Salic system, which excluded women from the crown unless all males in the agnatic descent from Philip, in any branch, became extinct. It is not implausible that this change might have been enacted at the insistence of a hostile foreign power, as the scenario of such a union could impinge profoundly on questions of national importance (particularly among states that preferred to maintain their distance from policy positions occupied by the Franco-Spanish consensus, of which the Holy Roman Empire was one). Some disagreement on this topic was evident for a number of years, even after it became clear that any question of a Franco-Spanish union was a political non-starter.

Although the Spanish government made several attempts to revert to the traditional order, as in the Decree of 1789 by Charles IV (see below), the succession question became pressing only when, by 1830, Ferdinand VII found himself ailing, without any issue, but with a pregnant wife. He decided in 1830 to promulgate the 1789 decree, securing the crown for the unborn child even if female. The law placed the child, Princess Isabel, ahead of Ferdinand&#x27;s brother Infante Carlos, who until then had been heir presumptive.

Many contemporaries (starting with the King&#x27;s brother and the cadet Bourbon branches) saw the changed succession as illegal on various counts. They formed the basis for the dynastic Carlist party, which only recognized the semi-Salic succession law that gave Infante Carlos precedence over Ferdinand&#x27;s daughter, the future Isabella II.

====Historical timeline====
* 13 May 1713: Philip V, first of the Spanish Bourbons, together with the Cortes, Spain&#x27;s parliament, through an &quot;Auto Accordado&quot; changes the order of succession to the Spanish crown from that outlined in the Siete Partidas. Where the previous rule consisted of male-preference primogeniture, Philip&#x27;s new law instituted semi-Salic law, under which accession of a female or her descendants is possible only following the extinction of all dynastic males descended in the male line from Philip V.
* 1789: During the reign of Charles IV, the Cortes approves a reversion of the system of succession to the traditional Siete Partidas order of succession. However, the law was not promulgated, due in part to protests from the cadet branches of the House of Bourbon (the Sicilian branch and the Parmesan branch), who saw it as diminishing their hereditary rights.
* 1812. A new Spanish constitution outlines the rules of succession in accordance with the Siete Partidas.
* 31 March 1830: Ferdinand VII, at the time without issue and his fourth wife pregnant, promulgates the Pragmatic Sanction of 1830 which ratifies the 1789 law, thereby re-establishing the pre-Philippine order of succession.
* 10 October 1830: The future Isabella II is born to Ferdinand VII. After several court intrigues, the Pragmatic Sanction was definitively approved in 1832. Ferdinand&#x27;s brother, the Infante Don Carlos, up to that time the heir presumptive, feels robbed of his rights, and leaves for Portugal.
* 1833–1876 Carlist Wars

====Political landscape after the death of Ferdinand VII (1833)====

As in many European countries, after the Napoleonic occupation, the Spanish political class was split between the &quot;absolutists&quot;, supporters of the ancien régime, and the Liberals, influenced by the ideas of the French Revolution. The long war for Spain&#x27;s independence from the Napoleonic Empire left a large supply of experienced guerrilla fighters and an oversized military officialdom—for the most part, staunch Liberals. The perceived success of the uprising of 1808 against Napoleon left also a broad, if unconscious, belief in the validity of the right of rebellion, with long-lasting effects on the politics of Spain and Spanish America, extending through the 19th century and beyond.

The reign of Ferdinand VII proved unable to overcome the political divide or to create stable institutions. The so-called Liberal Triennium (1820–1823) re-instated the 1812 constitution after a military &quot;pronunciamiento&quot;, but was followed by the Ominous Decade (1823–1833), ten years of absolute rule by the king, that left bitter memories of persecution in both parties. While in power, both groups had divided themselves into moderate and radical branches. The radical branch of the absolutists (or royalists), known as the &quot;Apostólicos&quot;, looked upon the heir presumptive, Don Carlos, as its natural head, as he was profoundly devout and, especially after 1820, staunchly anti-liberal.

In 1827, Catalonia was shaken by the rebellion of the &quot;Agreujats&quot; or &quot;Agraviados&quot; (&quot;the Aggrieved&quot;), an ultra-absolutist movement, which, for a time, controlled large parts of the region. The infante was for the first time then hailed as king. He denied any involvement. The last years of King Ferdinand saw a political realignment due to the troubles surrounding his succession. In October 1832, the King formed a moderate royalist government under Francisco Cea Bermúdez, which almost succeeded in curbing the Apostolic party and, through an amnesty, in gaining liberal support for Isabella&#x27;s right to succeed under the regency of her mother, Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. If only to get rid of Don Carlos, the Liberals accepted the new Princess of Asturias. Moreover, the first years of the 1830s were influenced by the failure of the French Restoration, which meant the end of Bourbon rule in France, and the civil war in Portugal between both legitimist and liberal parties.

====Social and economic factors====

Besides this political evolution, the years before the Carlist wars were marked by a deep economic crisis in Spain, partly spurred by the loss of the continental American provinces, and by the bankruptcy of the state. The last triggered enhanced tax pressures which further fueled social unrest. Certain economic measures proposed by the Liberals (such as the &quot;Desamortización&quot;, i.e. the takeover, division and sale of the commons and Church property, initiated in 1821) were directly threatening the viability of many small farms, whose residents were accustomed to rely on the common pasture lands to feed, at little or no cost, their mules and oxen. Widespread poverty followed, as did the closure of most hospitals, schools and other charities.

An important factor was the religious question. The radical liberals (&quot;progresistas&quot;) after 1820 had grown more and more anticlerical, strongly opposing religious institutes. They were suspected of being adherents of Freemasonry. This policy alienated them from many sectors of the (mostly deeply Catholic) Spanish people, especially in rural areas. The only institution abolished in the &quot;Liberal Triennium&quot; that was not restored by Ferdinand VII was the Inquisition. One of the demands of the radical absolutist party was its reinstitution. Liberals had been, while in power, quite doctrinaire, pursuing centralization and uniform administration.

Besides the Basque Country, in many regions of Spain there were intense particularist feelings, which were thus hurt. While only a secondary factor at the outbreak of the first Carlist war, this anti-uniformist localism, exemplified in the defence of the &quot;fueros&quot;, would become in time one of the more important banners of Carlism. This won Carlism support in the Basque territories (Navarre, Gipuzkoa, Biscay and Araba), as well as the old realms of the Crown of Aragon (Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia), as those areas resented the abolition of their ancient self-government privileges by issuance of the Nueva Planta Decrees.

==History==
The history of Carlism can be usefully divided into four different stages, whose dates are only approximate (thus the overlap is intentional):
* 1833–1876: factions pursued power mainly by military means.
* 1876–1936: Carlism reverted to a peaceful political movement.
* 1936–1975: During the Spanish Civil War, Carlists were part of Franco&#x27;s coalition. During the Franco regime, some government ministers were drawn from Franco&#x27;s Carlist supporters, but the movement as a whole was gradually marginalized by the generalissimo.
* 1975–present: After Franco&#x27;s death, the Carlist movement declines into near irrelevance.

===Carlist Wars (1833–1876)===

The period of the Carlist Wars, during which the party tried to attain power mainly through military means, is both classical Carlism, because the wars – or the threat of them – placed Carlism on the centre stage of Spain&#x27;s political history, and formative, as Carlism evolved the cultural and sociological form it would retain for well over a hundred years. Historical highlights of this era are the:
* First Carlist War (1833–1840)—a civil war in Spain from 1833 to 1840, fought between factions over the succession to the throne and the nature of the Spanish monarchy. It was fought between supporters of the regent, Maria Christina, acting for Isabella II of Spain, and those of the late king&#x27;s brother, Carlos de Borbón (or &quot;Carlos V&quot;). The Carlists&#x27; goal was the return to an absolute monarchy. Portugal, France and the United Kingdom supported the regency, and sent volunteer and even regular forces to confront the Carlist army.
* Affair of the Spanish Marriages (1846) was a series of intrigues between France, Spain, and the United Kingdom relating to the marriages of Queen Isabella II of Spain and her sister the infanta Luisa Fernanda.
* Second Carlist War (1847–1849)—was a minor Catalan uprising. The rebels tried to install Carlos VI on the throne. In Galicia, the uprising was on a smaller scale. The war was ostensibly fought to facilitate the marriage of Isabella II with the Carlist pretender, Carlos de Borbón (or &quot;Carlos VI&quot;), but Isabella II was instead wed to Francisco de Borbón.
* The 1860 expedition and its aftermath. That year the Count of Montemolín tried to seize power through a &quot;pronunciamiento&quot;. He landed in Sant Carles de la Ràpita (Tarragona), but was quickly detained, and forced to renounce his rights. This calamity, his behaviour after release, and the fact that the next in the line was his liberal brother, drove Carlism to the brink of extinction. It was only saved by the hand of his stepmother, the Maria Theresa of Braganza, Princess of Beira; and
* The &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; 1868. Isabella II managed to alienate almost everybody in Spain, until she was expelled that year by a progressivist revolution. At that point, Carlism, under its new head Carlos VII, became the rallying point for many political Catholics and conservatives, becoming the main bloc of right-wing opposition to the ensuing governments in Spain. After four years of political activity, and some hesitation, the martial option was again tried in
* The Third Carlist War (1872–1876).

====Points of convergence====
All three wars share a common development pattern:
# A first stage of guerrilla activity, across all of Spain.
# A second stage of territorial resistance is created, with regular army units created. The 1847 war did not get further than this.
# A third stage of territorial stability achieved through conventional leads to the creation of State structures. No Carlist war went further than this.

At the beginning of each war, no regular army unit was on the Carlist side, and only the third was the result of a planned uprising. The first war was noteworthy for being, on both sides, extremely brutal. The Liberal army mistreated the population, most of whom it suspected of being Carlist sympathizers, to the point of, sometimes, attempted extermination; Carlists, very often, treated Liberals no better than they had treated Napoleonic soldiers and agents, to such an extent that the international powers forced the warring parties to recognize some rules of war, namely the &quot;Lord Eliot Convention&quot;. Brutality did not disappear completely, and giving no quarter to one&#x27;s enemy was not uncommon.

The areas over which Carlism could establish some sort of territorial authority during the first war (Navarre, Rioja, the rural Basque Country, inner Catalonia, and northern Valencia) would remain the main bulwarks of Carlism throughout its history, although there were active supporters of the movement everywhere else in Spain. Especially in Navarre, Asturias, and parts of the Basque Provinces Carlism remained a significant political force until the late 1960s.

===Carlists in peace (1868–1936)===
The loss of prestige and subsequent fall of Isabel II in 1868, plus the staunch support of Carlism by Pope Pius IX, led a sizable number of former Isabelline conservative Catholics (e.g., Francisco Navarro Villoslada, Antonio Aparisi, Cándido Nocedal, Alejandro Pidal) to join the Carlist cause. For a time, even beyond the start of the third war (1872), it became the most important, and best organized, &quot;right-wing&quot; opposition group to the revolutionary regime, with some 90 members of parliament in 1871.

After the defeat, a group (led by Alejandro Pidal) left Carlism to form a moderate, non-dynastic Catholic party in Spain, which later merged with the conservatives of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo.

In 1879 Cándido Nocedal was charged with the reorganization of the party. His main weapon was a very aggressive press (in 1883 Pope Leo XIII published the encyclical &quot;Cum multa&quot;, trying to moderate it). His stance was an uncompromising adherence to the Carlists&#x27; political and, especially, religious principles (hence the term &quot;integrist&quot;). This tendency became so radical that in 1888, Carlos VII had to expel the group centred around Ramón Nocedal, Cándido&#x27;s son, which thus gave rise to another small, but in clerical circles influential, Integrist Party.

Meanwhile, Marquis de Cerralbo built up a modern mass party, centered around the local assemblies (called &quot;Círculos&quot;, of which several hundred existed throughout Spain in 1936) and their social action programmes, and in active opposition to the political system of the Restoration (participating even in broad coalitions, such as 1907&#x27;s &quot;Solidaritat Catalana&quot;, with regionalists and republicans). During electoral campaigns the Carlists, except Navarre, achieved little success.

From 1893 to 1918, Juan Vázquez de Mella was its most important parliamentary leader and ideologue, seconded by Víctor Pradera, who had wide influence on Spanish conservative thinking beyond the party. World War I had a special influence on Carlism. As the Carlist claimant, then Jaime, Duke of Madrid, had close ties to the Russian Imperial Family, had been mistreated by Austrian Emperor Franz Josef, and was also Head of the House of Bourbon, he favoured the Allies, but was living under house arrest in Austria, at Schloss Frohsdorf, with almost no communication with the political leadership in Spain. As the war ended and Don Jaime could again freely communicate with Spain, a crisis erupted, and Vázquez de Mella and others had to leave the party&#x27;s leadership (the so-called &quot;Mellists&quot;).

In 1920, Carlism helped to found the &quot;Sindicatos Libres&quot; (Catholic Labour Unions) to counter the increased influence of leftist trade unions over the working class, clinging to a difficult balance between labour claims and the interests of the upper-class, to whom Carlism was so attached. Miguel Primo de Rivera&#x27;s dictatorship (1923–1930) was opposed but ambiguously viewed by Carlism, which, like most parties, entered a period of slumber, only to be awakened by the coming of the Second Republic in 1931. In the run-up to the proclamation of the Republic, the Carlists got together with the re-founded Basque Nationalist Party within the pro-&quot;charters&quot; &quot;Coalición Católico Fuerista&quot; in the core areas of Carlism, the Basque region, thus providing the springboard for the draft Basque Statute.

In October 1931, Carlist claimant to the Spanish throne Duke Jaime died. He was succeeded by the 82-year-old claimant Alfonso Carlos de Borbón, reuniting under him the integralists led by Olazábal and the &quot;Mellists&quot;. They represented a region-based Spanish nationalism with an entrenched identification of Spain and Catholicism. The ensuing radicalized Carlist scene overshadowed the &quot;Jaimists&quot; with a Basque inclination. The Basque(-Navarrese) Statute failed to take off over disagreements on the centrality of Catholicism in 1932, with the new Carlist party &quot;Comunión Tradicionalista&quot; opting for an open confrontation with the Republic. The Republic established a secular approach of the regime, a division of Church and state, as well as freedom of cults, as France did in 1905, an approach traditionalists could not stand.

The &quot;Comunión Tradicionalista&quot; (1932) showed an ultra-Catholic, anti-secular position, and plotted for a military takeover, while adopting far-right apocalyptic views and talking of a final clash with an alliance of alleged anti-Christian forces. The most extreme proponent of these views was Juan Vazquez de Mella, who argued that Jewish capital had financed the liberal revolution and was now behind the Communist revolution in order, in union with the &quot;Muslim hordes&quot; (even the native tribesmen of the Rif fighting for their freedom), to destroy Christian civilization and impose a &quot;Jewish tyranny on the world&quot;. At the time, a Rothschild-Marx link and a bridgehead laid over Spain was being cited in the far-right circles to found these claims.

In Navarre, the main Carlist stronghold, the movement revolved around the newspaper &quot;El Pensamiento Navarro&quot;, read almost exclusively by the clergy and second in circulation to &quot;El Diario de Navarra&quot;, another ultra-Conservative daily with an anti-Basque streak. The dormant paramilitary &quot;Requeté&quot; of the early 20th century was activated. As early as May 1931, Jaime del Burgo (father of the 1979 UPN namesake party leader) and other &quot;Jaimist&quot; young members organized arms smuggling from Eibar to distribute them among &quot;defence&quot; parties called &quot;Decurias&quot;, counting on the financing of wealthy personalities (big landowners, etc.). In 1932, the first coup d&#x27;état attempt took place against the Republic in the &quot;Sanjurjada&quot;, with a Carlist inspiration.

The October 1934 Revolution cost the life of the Carlist deputy Marcelino Oreja Elósegui, with Manuel Fal Condé taking over from young Carlists clustering around the AET (Jaime del Burgo and Mario Ozcoidi) in their pursuit to overthrow the Republic. The Carlists started to prepare for an armed definite clash with the Republic and its different leftist groups. From the initial defensive &quot;Decurias&quot; of Navarre (deployed in party seats and churches), the &quot;Requeté&quot; grew into a well-trained and strongest offensive paramilitary group in Spain when Manuel Fal Condé took the reins. It numbered 30,000 &quot;red berets&quot; (8,000 in Navarre and 22,000 in Andalusia).

===Spanish Civil War and Franco regime (1936–1975)===
====During the war (1936–1939)====


The Carlist militia, the &quot;Requetés&quot;, had been receiving military training during the Second Spanish Republic but had significant ideological differences with many of the conspiring generals. With the July 1936 revolt and the ensuing Spanish Civil War, the Carlists fell naturally if uneasily on the side of the Nationalist rebels. General Mola, known for his openness on his no-holds-barred, criminal approach, had just been relocated away to Pamplona by the Republican authorities, ironically to the very heart of the far-right rebellion.

In May 1936, the General met with Ignacio Baleztena, a Navarrese Carlist figure at the head of the &quot;Requetés&quot;, offering the participation of 8,400 voluntaries to support the uprising, turned into a counter-revolutionary reaction. The principles divide between Manuel Fal Conde and Mola (basically a Falangist) almost broke the understanding for a Carlist allegiance to the coup on 4 July 1936. However, rebellious cooperation against the legitimate Republican government was restored by the intervention of Tomás Domínguez Arévalo, count of Rodezno.

The highest Carlist authority, Duke Alfonso Carlos, did not approve of the pact, but all the same, by then Mola was negotiating directly with the Carlist Navarre Council (&quot;Junta Navarra&quot;), one that opted for the support of the uprising. On 19 July, the state of war was declared in Pamplona and the Carlist corps (&quot;tercio&quot;) in the city took over. In a few days, just about all of Navarre was occupied by the military and the &quot;Requetés&quot;. There was no front.

Immediately the rebels, with a direct participation of the &quot;Requetés&quot; and the clergy (the Carlist core in Navarre), engaged in a brutal repression to stamp out dissent that affected all inconvenient, mildly progressive, or Basque nationalist inhabitants and personalities. The killing in the rearguard took a direct death toll (extrajudicial executions) ranging from 2,857 to 3,000 to . A bleak scene of social humiliation and submission ensued for those surviving.

The Carlists&#x27; prospects in Gipuzkoa and Biscay were not auspicious. The military coup failed, and Carlist units were overwhelmed by forces loyal to the Republic, i.e. different leftist forces and the Basque nationalists. Many crossed the front line to make themselves safe in the rebel zone, and added to the Carlist regiments in Álava and Navarre. Pamplona became the rebel launching point for the War in the North.

On 8 December 1936, Fal Conde had to leave temporarily for Portugal after a major clash with Franco. On 19 April 1937 the Carlist political bloc was &quot;unified&quot; with the Falange under the pro-Franco, umbrella nationalist party, &quot;Falange Española Tradicionalista de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista&quot; or &quot;FET de las JONS&quot;. Unwilling to leave the Nationalist movement, but unhappy with the merger, the new Carlist claimant Javier, prince de Borbón-Parma, condemned those Carlists who joined the new party. He was expelled from the country, while Fal Conde was not allowed to return to Spain until after the war. Low-level Carlists, with the notable exception of those in Navarre, generally distanced themselves from the workings of the new party and in many cases never joined at all.

====Francoist Spain====
Henceforth, the mainstream kept an uncomfortable minority position inside the regime, more often than not at odds with its official policy, although the Ministry of Justice was thrice given to a loyal &quot;Carlist&quot; (who was accordingly expelled from the Traditionalist Communion). This time was also marred by the problem of succession and internal strife over Francoism. Carlist ministers in Franco&#x27;s August 1939 cabinet included General José Enrique Varela at army, and Esteban Bilbao at justice. At the same time, two of nine seats in the Junta Política were given to Carlists. Of the hundred-member National Council of the FET, seven seats were occupied by Carlists.

Carlists continued to clash with Falangists, notably in an incident at Bilbao&#x27;s Basilica of Begoña on 16 August 1942. Accounts of the violence vary, but a Carlist rally (where some allegedly shouted anti-Franco slogans) was targeted by two grenades hurled by Falangists. While alleged fatalities and the number of those injured have long been disputed, the incident led to a shakeup of the Franco cabinet and the judicial conviction of six Falangists (one, Juan José Domínguez, was executed for the crime).

In 1955, Fal Conde resigned as Jefe Delegado of the movement and was replaced by José María Valiente, who formally assumed the title in 1960. The change marked a shift from opposition to collaboration with Francoism, and the rapprochement ended in 1968 when Valiente left office. Franco recognized both the titles of nobility conceded by the Carlist claimants and those of the Isabelline branch. At his death, the movement was badly split, and unable to get wide public attention again. In 1971, Don Carlos Hugo, prince de Borbón-Parma founded the new Carlist Party based on the confederalist vision for &quot;Las Españas&quot; (&quot;the Spains&quot;) and socialist autogestion (then promoted in Yugoslavia). At Montejurra, on 9 May 1976, adherents of the old and new versions of Carlism brawled. Two Hugo supporters were killed by far-right militants, among whom was Stefano Delle Chiaie. The Carlist Party accused Hugo&#x27;s younger brother, Don Sixto Enrique de Borbón-Parma, of aiding the militants, which collaboration the Traditionalist Communion denies.

===Post-Franco period (1975–present)===
In the first democratic elections on 15 June 1977, only one Carlist senator was elected, journalist and writer Fidel Carazo from Soria, who ran as an independent candidate. In the parliamentary elections of 1979, rightist Carlists integrated in the far-right coalition &quot;Unión Nacional&quot;, which won a seat in the Cortes for Madrid; but the elected candidate was not himself a Carlist. The Carlists have since remained extra-parliamentary, obtaining only town council seats.

In 2002, Carlos Hugo donated the House&#x27;s archives to the &quot;Archivo Histórico Nacional&quot;, which was protested by his brother Don Sixto Enrique and by all Carlist factions. Into the 21st century, there are three political organizations which claim the Carlist identity:
* Traditionalist Communion (led by José Miguel Gambra Gutiérrez)
* Traditionalist Carlist Communion (led by Telmo Aldaz de la Quadra-Salcedo)
* Partido Carlista (led by Jesús María Aragón Samanes)

==Carlist claimants to the throne==
The regnal numbers are those used by their supporters. While they were not proclaimed kings, they made use of some titles associated with the Spanish throne.

===The succession after Alfonso Carlos===
At the death of Alfonso Carlos in 1936 most Carlists supported Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma whom Alfonso Carlos had named as regent of the Carlist Communion. A minority of Carlists supported Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince of Tuscany, a grandson through the female line of Carlos VII. A fringe movement of Carlists supported Alfonso XIII, the exiled constitutional king of Spain, who was the senior male-line descendant of King Charles IV, through his third son Francisco de Paula (whose eldest son Francisco de Asís had married his cousin Isabella II). The majority of Carlists, however, considered Alfonso disqualified because he did not share the Carlist ideals (and, importantly, because Spanish law excluded from succession the descendants of those who commit treason against the king, as Carlists deem Alfonso&#x27;s male-line ancestors to have done once Francisco de Paula recognized the reign of Isabella II). Many also regarded his descent as illegitimate, believing that Alfonso XII&#x27;s biological father was a lover of Queen Isabella&#x27;s rather than her husband. Most of the following events happened under the regime of Francisco Franco, who skillfully played each faction off against the others.

====Borbón-Parma claim====
* Francisco Javier I

Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma (25 May 1889 – 7 May 1977), known in Spain as &quot;Don Javier de Borbón&quot;, had been named regent of the Carlist Communion by Alfonso Carlos in 1936 as the nearest member of the House of Bourbon who shared the Carlist ideals.

During the Second World War, Prince Xavier returned to the Belgian army, where he had served during World War I. He was demobilized and joined the French maquis. He was taken prisoner by the Nazis and sent to Natzweiler and Dachau concentration camp, where American troops liberated him in 1945. In 1952, Javier was proclaimed King of Spain, asserting Carlist legitimacy. Since the death of Alfonso Carlos, his successor by right of agnatic primogeniture had yet to be determined. To do so, it was necessary to trace the patriline of Philip V to his seniormost descendant who was not excluded from the throne by law (for treason, morganatic marriage, birth out-of-wedlock and other reasons legally established in the &quot;Novísima Recopilación&quot; of 1805, in force at the time of the First Carlist War). In 1952, when all lines senior to the House of Bourbon-Parma were deemed excluded, the claim was taken up by Don Javier (descended from Philip, Duke of Parma, third son of Philip V). Even though he was raised in the Carlist camp and named regent of the Carlist Communion in 1936, his proclamation as king later in 1956 was, it was asserted, not a political move based on ideology, but the consequence of dynastic legitimacy. He remained the Carlist claimant until his renunciation in 1975.

Changes in the views of some in the Carlist movement polarized Javier&#x27;s supporters between his two sons, Carlos Hugo and Sixto Enrique (and many more endorsing neither) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Carlos Hugo turned organized Carlism into a socialist movement, while his brother Sixto Enrique (supported by his mother Madeleine de Bourbon-Busset) followed a far rightist course. In 1977, Sixto Enrique&#x27;s supporters published a manifesto from Javier condemning Carlos Hugo. Several days later Carlos Hugo&#x27;s supporters published a manifesto from Javier recognising Carlos Hugo as his heir.
* Carlos Hugo I

Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma (8 April 1930 – 18 August 2010), was the elder son of Xavier. He was a Carlist claimant from 1977 until his death. After alienating many Carlists by his attempts to approach Franco (1965–1967), Carlos Hugo switched to a leftist Titoist, workers&#x27; self-management socialist movement. In 1979 he accepted Spanish citizenship from King Juan Carlos I and in 1980 he renounced his membership in the Partido Carlista, which he had created. Carlos Hugo had the support of a minority of Carlists including the Partido Carlista. He also excluded the Luxembourger branch of the family from Carlist succession due to unequal marriages by princes of that branch that were recognized as dynastic by the Grand Duke.
* Carlos Javier I

Prince Carlos, Duke of Parma (born 27 January 1970), is the elder son of Carlos Hugo. He inherited the Carlist claim on his father&#x27;s death in 2010. Carlos has the support of a minority of Carlists including the Partido Carlista.
* Sixto Enrique

Prince Sixto Enrique of Bourbon-Parma (born 22 July 1940) claims to be the current regent of the Carlist Communion. He is known as the Duke of Aranjuez.

&quot;Don&quot; Sixto Enrique is supported by the minority &quot;Comunión Tradicionalista&quot;, and some others who believe that his elder brother Carlos Hugo was the rightful heir, but ineligible for the succession on account of his socialism. Sixto Enrique has never claimed to be Carlist king, in the hopes that one of his nephews will one day accept traditional Carlist values.

====Habsburgo-Borbón claim====
The eldest daughter of Infante Carlos, Duke of Madrid, was Blanca de Borbón y Borbón-Parma (1868–1949). She married Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria (1863–1931). In 1943, one of their sons presented himself as a Carlist claimant in succession to his great-uncle Alfonso Carlos. Since this claim comes through a female line, it is rejected by most Carlists:
* Archduke Karl Pius of Austria, Prince of Tuscany, was a Carlist claimant from 1943 to 1953. He was supported by some of General Franco&#x27;s officials from the Movimiento Nacional. As he assumed the title of &quot;King Carlos VIII&quot;, the movement that supports this branch of the family is called Carloctavismo.
* Archduke Anton of Austria, Prince of Tuscany, was the brother of Karl Pius and was a Carlist claimant (Carlos IX) from 1953 to 1961.
* Archduke Franz Josef of Austria, Prince of Tuscany, was the brother of Karl Pius and Anton and was a Carlist claimant (Francisco I) from 1961 to 1975.
* Archduke Dominic of Austria, Prince of Tuscany, is the son of Anton and has been a Carlist claimant (Domingo I) since 1975.

In 2012, Senator Iñaki Anasagasti of the Basque Country proposed the idea of creating a united Basque-Navarrese-Catalan monarchy with Archduke Dominic of Austria as its king.

====Borbón claim====
* Alfonso de Borbón
Alfonso XIII became the senior representative by primogeniture of the House of Bourbon at the death of Alfonso Carlos in 1936. He had reigned as the constitutional king of Spain as Alfonso XIII until his exile in 1931. He was the son of King Alfonso XII, son of Francisco de Asis de Borbón, son of Infante Francisco de Paula, the younger brother of Charles V. He was recognised as Carlist claimant by a small number of Carlists who considered the death of Alfonso Carlos an opportunity to reunite Spanish monarchists, both Carlist and Isabelline. Nonetheless, despite this apparently attractive opportunity, Francisco de Paula and his descendants were considered legally and morally excluded from the line of succession by many Carlists as traitors, according to the Spanish laws of succession as they stood in 1833 (and as defended by Carlists since then). In 1941 Alfonso abdicated; he died two months later.

Alfonso&#x27;s eldest son had died in 1938. His second son Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia had been pressured to renounce his rights to the constitutional succession in 1933. Both had married morganatically. King Alfonso&#x27;s third son, &quot;Don&quot; Juan, Count of Barcelona was his chosen successor.
* Juan de Borbón claim
** Infante Don Juan, Count of Barcelona (20 June 1913 – 1 April 1993) was the third son of Alfonso XIII. He was a claimant to the throne of Spain from 1941 until his renunciation in 1977. In 1957, a group of Carlists recognized him as their chief in his exile at Estoril, Portugal.
** King Juan Carlos I is the surviving son of Don Juan, Count of Barcelona. He was the King of Spain from 1975 until his abdication in 2014.
** King Felipe VI is the only son of Juan Carlos I. He is the current representative of this claim. He has been the king of Spain since 2014, confirmed by the Spanish Constitution of 1978.
* Jaime de Borbón claim
** Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, was the second son of Alfonso XIII, and the older brother of Juan, Count of Barcelona. Despite his 1933 renunciation of the Spanish throne, in 1960 Jaime announced that he was the Carlist claimant and occasionally used the title &quot;Duke of Madrid&quot;; he remained a claimant until his death in 1975. He had only a few Carlist supporters, but among these was Alicia de Borbón y de Borbón-Parma, the only surviving daughter of the previous Carlist claimant Carlos, Duke of Madrid. Jaime also became the Legitimist claimant to the French throne, using the title &quot;Duke of Anjou&quot;; in this capacity, he had some supporters.
** Prince Alphonse, Duke of Anjou and Cádiz, was the son of Jaime. He did not claim the Carlist succession between 1975 and his death in 1989.
** Prince Louis, Duke of Anjou, is the son of Alfonso. He has never claimed the Carlist succession.

==Ideology==

Carlism or Traditionalism can be labelled as a counter-revolutionary movement. Carlism&#x27;s intellectual landscape was a reaction against the Liberal, Radical, and anti-religious currents of the Enlightenment in Spain; in particular the Bourbon Reforms, the confiscation and sale of Church property by the State, the expulsion of the religious orders, and Government bans on Catholic schools and Classical Christian education based on the Trivium. In this sense, it is akin to the French (Legitimism) and Joseph de Maistre&#x27;s thinking, but it also bears a close similarity with the Jacobitism of the British Isles. It is difficult to give an accurate description of Carlist thinking for several reasons:
* As adherents of traditionalist conservatism, Carlists mistrusted radical solutions as a political driving force. Some 19th-century pamphlets expressed it in this form: against a &quot;philosophical&quot; constitution (liberalism, based on ideology), a &quot;historical&quot; constitution is proposed (based on history, and Catholic social teaching).
* Carlism&#x27;s long active history—it has been an important force for over 170 years—and the fact that it attracted a large and diverse following, makes a comprehensive categorization more difficult.
* As they were held together as a movement mainly by shared opposition to the status quo, there has almost never been a single cohesive ideology inside the Carlist movement.
* The ideas expressed inside Carlism were partly and openly shared with many other forces on the political spectrum. The more conservative, Catholic (or Christian democracy) and language revival wings of the various nationalist and regionalist movements throughout Spain have their roots in Carlist thought, particularly relating to &quot;fueros&quot; and localized self-government.

While Carlism and Falangism had certain similarities—social conservatism, Catholic social teaching, anti-Marxism, and beginning the reversal of the Secularization of Spanish culture by overturning anti-Catholic laws and policies that began with the Suppression of the Jesuits and the Bourbon Reforms in the 18th-century—there were also stark differences between the two movements. Most significant, Falangism called for a strong centralized government, coercive Hispanization through the educational system, and Spanish nationalism, Carlism was more supportive of the &quot;fueros&quot;, preserving and reviving regional traditions, linguistic rights for local heritage languages, and regional autonomy were their main tenets. Carlism also supports Salic Law regarding royal succession to the Spanish throne and accordingly count as Legitimists.

===Dios, Patria, Fueros, Rey===

These four words (which can be translated as God, Fatherland, Local Rule, and King), have been the motto and cornerstone of Carlism throughout its existence. What Carlism understood by these was:
* &quot;Dios&quot; (God): Carlism believes in the Catholic Faith as a cornerstone of Spain and must be politically active in its defence.
* &quot;Patria&quot; (Fatherland): Carlism is heavily patriotic, Traditionalism sees the Fatherland as the nesting of communities (municipal, regional, Spain) united under one.
* &quot;Fueros&quot; (similar to medieval charters): Part of the limitation of royal powers is the acknowledgement of local and regional self-rule (and of other types of communities in the political body, especially the Church). Although the result of a peculiar historical development in Spain, it converged with the concept of subsidiarity in Catholic social thought. Note that some versions of the motto omit the Fueros clause.
* &quot;Rey&quot; (King): The concept of national sovereignty is rejected. Sovereignty is vested in the king, both legitimate in blood and in deeds. But this power is limited by the doctrine of the Church and the Laws and Usages of the Kingdom, and through a series of Councils, traditional Cortes and state-independent intermediate bodies. The King must also be the Defender of the Poor and Keeper of Justice.

===Supporters===
Carlism was a true &quot;mass movement&quot; and drew its rank and file from all social classes, with a majority of peasant and working-class elements. Thus, it is no surprise that Carlism was involved in the creation of Catholic trade unions.

===Offshoots and influence===

* Cultural and political regionalism in Spain (not to be mistaken with regional nationalism or separatism) was largely Carlist-originated. The influence of Carlist thinker Juan Vázquez de Mella in this field can still be traced today.
* One of the founders of Basque nationalism, Sabino Arana, came from a Carlist background, and for many years competed for the same audience (Basque Catholics). Compare the PNV slogan &quot;God and Fueros&quot;. Spanish Carlists with Franco battled and defeated Basque nationalists in 1936–1937.
* &quot;Fuerismo&quot; was a doctrine prevalent in the Basque provinces. It supported the Isabelline monarchy but wanted to preserve the Fuero autonomy of the provinces.
* Catholic politics are essential for Carlism. Compare the slogan Christus Rex.
* Victor Pradera&#x27;s thinking was very influential, through the group Acción Española, in Spanish authoritarian thinking in the 1930s and 1940s.
* Fernando Sebastián Aguilar, Archbishop of Pamplona and Tudela (Spain) caused controversy by publicly stating on 7 May 2007 that the Traditionalist Carlist Communion, among others, is worthy of consideration and of electoral support.
==Symbols==
* Motto: Dios, Patria, Fueros, Rey
* Flag: the red cross of Burgundy on white
* The red beret. In Basque, the Carlist troops were hence called &quot;txapelgorri&quot; –though the name was also shared by units of the opposing Liberal side. The red beret was worn as a distinguishing device by Carlists soldiers in the First Carlist War and later became an emblem of Carlists in general, often with a yellow pom-pom or tassel.

The term &quot;carlistas&quot; when applied to followers of Carlos Maria Isidro emerged in the mid-1820s and has even filtered out to public discourse overseas. Following outbreak of the civil war in 1833 the liberal and pro-government press started to use the denomination commonly, though initially also the name of &quot;carlinos&quot; remained in circulation, along expressions like &quot;facciosos&quot;, &quot;rebeldes&quot;, somewhat less frequent &quot;absolutistas&quot; and other denominations, often intended as insults. The followers of Carlos Maria initially did not use the term, and preferred to refer to themselves in general terms as defenders of faith, monarchy, traditional order and/or legitimism; they cautiously started to accept the name in the 1840s. Gradually in the Isabelline period the term became common and used universally, also by the Carlists themselves. In 1909–1931 the movement was often referred to as &quot;Jaimismo&quot;/&quot;Jaimistas&quot;, as the claimant Don Jaime exceptionally did not bear the iconic name of Carlos.

In the late 19th century a related but not equivalent term &quot;tradicionalistas&quot; entered into circulation and was also applied either to the movement in general or to some of its factions in particular; however, in press usage until the fall of the monarchy in 1931 &quot;carlistas&quot;/&quot;carlismo&quot; was 7 times more popular than &quot;tradicionalistas&quot;/&quot;tradicionalismo&quot;. During the republican period of 1931–1936 public usage changed; &quot;tradicionalistas&quot;/&quot;tradicionalismo&quot; were used 2–3 times more frequently than &quot;carlistas&quot;/&quot;carlismo&quot;, though the former assumed somewhat broader connotation. In the Francoist era of 1939–1975 the press, tightly censored especially until the mid-1960s, gave slight precedence to &quot;carlistas&quot; vs &quot;tradicionalistas&quot; and to &quot;tradicionalismo&quot; vs &quot;carlismo&quot;. For the post-Francoist period there is no representative statistics available. Currently in historiography and political science there is little agreement as to mutual relationship between &quot;traditionalism&quot; and &quot;carlism&quot;.

Until the late 1860s, the Carlist movement did not assume a formal structure. Shortly before the outbreak of the Third Carlist War the first Carlist political organization emerged; during the following 160 years the mainstream movement was embodied into various political entities, some of them loose and with somewhat different names adopted locally. Relatively little significance was attached to organization, as Carlists considered themselves a broad social movement which in a sense was antithetical to a party. Splinter factions used to build their own structures, and the names of these evolved as well, some names were re-cycled and in popular discourse various alternate, informal or incorrect formal names have been used. Differences between informal and formal names have been often disregarded. The result was naming confusion, e.g. in the early 20th century 48% of press references featured &quot;partido carlista&quot; or &quot;Partido Carlista&quot;, 18% featured &quot;Partido Tradicionalista&quot;, 15% featured &quot;Partido Jaimista&quot; and 13% &quot;Comunión Tradicionalista&quot;, plus at least 4 other denominations in circulation. In the mid-1930s the claimant Alfonso Carlos intended to introduce some discipline and declared that the only formal name be this of &quot;Comunión Tradicionalista Carlista&quot;, but he later himself referred to &quot;Comunión Católico-Monárquico-Legitimista&quot;. Statistical summary of frequency of various names as in press usage is reviewed in the below table.

==Literary references to Carlism==

The liberal Spanish journalist Mariano José de Larra opposed Carlism and published several lampoons against it. &quot;Nadie pase sin hablar al portero&quot; (1833) presents Carlists as a bunch of bandit priests. Ernest Hemingway refers to Carlism in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. He mentions two fascists and says, &quot;They were Carlists from Navarra&quot;. Francisco Navarro-Villoslada was a Carlist writer that published a historic novel, &quot;Amaya o los vascos en el siglo VIII&quot;, in the fashion of Walter Scott, presenting the legendary origins of Spanish monarchy as the start of Reconquista. &quot;The Arrow of Gold&quot; by Joseph Conrad is set against the background of the third Carlist war.

Ramón María del Valle-Inclán, novelist, poet and playwright, was a member of the Spanish Generation of 1898. He wrote novels about Carlism and was an active Carlist himself. Pío Baroja wrote a novel, &quot;Zalacaín el aventurero&quot; (&quot;Zalacain the Adventurer&quot;), set during the Third Carlist War, and referred to Carlism in an unfavourable light in several other works. The Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno suffered as a child the siege of Bilbao during the Third Carlist War. Later he wrote a novel &quot;Paz en la guerra&quot; about that time. In 1895 he wrote to Joaquín Costa about his plans for an essay on the &quot;intrahistoric&quot; element of rural socialism within the Carlist masses. The American conservative writer and &quot;National Review&quot; columnist, L. Brent Bozell Jr., sympathized with Carlism and Francoism and considered Spanish Catholic authoritarianism to be preferable to American democracy.

<doc id="293533" wikidata="Q2829907" url="?curid=293533" title="Sign convention">
<text>In physics, a sign convention is a choice of the physical significance of signs (plus or minus) for a set of quantities, in a case where the choice of sign is arbitrary. &quot;Arbitrary&quot; here means that the same physical system can be correctly described using different choices for the signs, as long as one set of definitions is used consistently. The choices made may differ between authors. Disagreement about sign conventions is a frequent source of confusion, frustration, misunderstandings, and even outright errors in scientific work. In general, a sign convention is a special case of a choice of coordinate system for the case of one dimension.

Sometimes, the term &quot;sign convention&quot; is used more broadly to include factors of the imaginary unit and , rather than just choices of sign.

== Relativity ==

===Metric signature===
In relativity, the metric signature can be either or . (Throughout this article, the signs of the eigenvalues of the metric are displayed in the order that presents the timelike component first, followed by the spacelike components). A similar convention is used in higher-dimensional relativistic theories; that is, or . A choice of signature is associated with a variety of names, physics discipline, and notable graduate-level textbooks:

===Curvature===
The Ricci tensor is defined as the contraction of the Riemann tensor. Some authors use the contraction formula_1, whereas others use the alternative formula_2. Due to the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, these two definitions differ by a minus sign.

In fact, the second definition of the Ricci tensor is formula_3. The sign of the Ricci tensor does not change, because the two sign conventions concern the sign of the Riemann tensor. The second definition just compensates the sign, and it works together with the second definition of the Riemann tensor (see e.g. Barrett O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Semi-riemannian geometry).

== Other sign conventions ==

* The sign choice for time in frames of reference and proper time: + for future and − for past is universally accepted.
* The choice of formula_4 in the Dirac equation.
* The sign of the electric charge, field strength tensor formula_5 in gauge theories and classical electrodynamics.
* Time dependence of a positive-frequency wave (see, e.g., the electromagnetic wave equation):
** formula_6 (mainly used by physicists)
** formula_7 (mainly used by engineers)
* The sign for the imaginary part of permittivity (in fact dictated by the choice of sign for time-dependence).
* The signs of distances and radii of curvature of optical surfaces in optics.
* The sign of work in the first law of thermodynamics.
* The sign of the weight of a tensor density, such as the weight of the determinant of the covariant metric tensor.
* The active and passive sign convention of current, voltage and power in electrical engineering.
* A sign convention used for curved mirrors assigns a positive focal length to concave mirrors and a negative focal length to convex mirrors.

It is often considered good form to state explicitly which sign convention is to be used at the beginning of each book or article.

<doc id="293540" wikidata="Q506254" url="?curid=293540" title="Naked eye">
<text>Naked eye, also called bare eye or unaided eye, is the practice of engaging in visual perception unaided by a magnifying, light-collecting optical instrument, such as a telescope or microscope, or eye protection.

In astronomy, the naked eye may be used to observe celestial events and objects visible without equipment, such as conjunctions, passing comets, meteor showers, and the brightest asteroids, including 4 Vesta. Sky lore and various tests demonstrate an impressive variety of phenomena visible to the unaided eye.

==Basic properties==
Some basic properties of the human eye are:
*Quick autofocus from distances of 25 cm (young people) to 50 cm (most people 50 years and older) to infinity.
*Angular resolution: about 1 arcminute, approximately 0.017° or 0.0003 radians, which corresponds to 0.3 m at a 1 km distance.
*Field of view (FOV): simultaneous visual perception in an area of about 160° × 175°.
*Ability to see faint stars up to +8 magnitude under a perfectly dark sky.
*Photometry (brightness) to ±10% or 1% of intensity – in a range between night and day of 1:10,000,000,000.
*Symmetries of 10–20&#x27; (3–6 m per 1 km), see the measurements of Tycho Brahe.
*Interval estimations (for example at a plan on paper) to 3–5%.
*Unconscious recognizing of movement (that is &quot;alarm system&quot; and reflexes).

Visual perception allows a person to gain much information about their surroundings:
*the distances and 3-dimensional position of things and persons
*the vertical (plumb line) and the slope of plane objects
*luminosities and colors and their changes by time and direction

==In astronomy==


The visibility of astronomical objects is strongly affected by light pollution. Even a few hundred kilometers away from a metropolitan area where the sky can appear to be very dark, it is still the residual light pollution that sets the limit on the visibility of faint objects. For most people, these are likely to be the best observing conditions within their reach. Under such &quot;typical&quot; dark sky conditions, the naked eye can see stars with an apparent magnitude up to +6m. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent, stars as faint as +8m might be visible.

The angular resolution of the naked eye is about 1; however, some people have sharper vision than that. There is anecdotal evidence that people had seen the Galilean moons of Jupiter before telescopes were invented. Uranus and Vesta had most probably been seen but could not be recognized as planets because they appear so faint even at maximum brightness; Uranus&#x27;s magnitude varies from +5.3m to +5.9m, and Vesta&#x27;s from +5.2m to +8.5m (so that it is only visible near its opposition dates). Uranus, when discovered in 1781, was the first planet discovered using technology (a telescope) rather than being spotted by the naked eye.

Theoretically, in a typical dark sky, the dark adapted human eye would see the about 5,600 stars brighter than +6m while in perfect dark sky conditions about 45,000 stars brighter than +8m might be visible. In practice, the atmospheric extinction and dust reduces this number somewhat. In the center of a city, where the naked-eye limiting magnitude due to extreme amounts of light pollution can be as low as 2m, as few as 50 stars are visible. Colors can be seen but this is limited by the fact that the eye uses rods instead of cones to view fainter stars.

The visibility of diffuse objects such as star clusters and galaxies is much more strongly affected by light pollution than is that of planets and stars. Under typical dark conditions only a few such objects are visible. These include the Pleiades, h/χ Persei, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Carina Nebula, the Orion Nebula, Omega Centauri, 47 Tucanae, the Ptolemy Cluster Messier 7 near the tail of Scorpius and the globular cluster M13 in Hercules. The Triangulum Galaxy (M33) is a difficult averted vision object and only visible at all if it is higher than 50° in the sky. The globular clusters M 3 in Canes Venatici and M 92 in Hercules are also visible with the naked eye under such conditions. Under really dark sky conditions, however, M33 is easy to see, even in direct vision. Many other Messier objects are also visible under such conditions. The most distant objects that have been seen by the naked eye are nearby bright galaxies such as Centaurus A, Bode&#x27;s Galaxy, Sculptor Galaxy, and Messier 83.

Five planets can be recognized as planets from Earth with the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Under typical dark sky conditions Uranus (magnitude +5.8) can be seen as well with averted vision, as can the asteroid Vesta at its brighter oppositions. Under perfect dark sky conditions Neptune may be visible to the Naked eye only if Neptune is at its maximum brightness (magnitude +7.8). The Sun and the Moon—the remaining noticeable naked-eye objects of the solar system—are sometimes added to make seven &quot;planets&quot;. During daylight only the Moon and Sun are obvious naked eye objects, but in many cases Venus can be spotted in daylight and in rarer cases Jupiter. Close to sunset and sunrise, bright stars like Sirius or even Canopus can be spotted with the naked eye as long as one knows the exact position in which to look.
Historically, the zenith of naked-eye astronomy was the work of Tycho Brahe (1546–1601). He built an extensive observatory to make precise measurements of the heavens without any instruments for magnification. In 1610, Galileo Galilei pointed a telescope towards the sky. He immediately discovered the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus, among other things.

Meteor showers are better observed by naked eye than with binoculars. Such showers include the Perseids (10–12 August) and the December Geminids. Some 100 satellites per night, the International Space Station and the Milky Way are other popular objects visible to the naked eye.

On 19 March 2008, a major gamma-ray burst (GRB) known as GRB 080319B, set a new record as the farthest object that can be seen from Earth with the naked eye. It occurred about 7.5 billion years ago, the light taking that long to reach Earth.

==In geodesy and navigation==
Many other things can be estimated without an instrument. If an arm is stretched the span of the hand corresponds to an angle of 18 to 20°. The distance of a person, just covered up by the outstretched thumbnail, is about 100 meters. The vertical can be estimated to about 2° and, in the northern hemisphere, observing the Pole Star and using a protractor can give the observer&#x27;s geographic latitude, up to 1 degree of accuracy.

The Babylonians, Mayans, ancient Egyptians, ancient Indians, and Chinese measured all the basics of their respective time and calendar systems by naked eye:
*the length of a year and a month to ±0.1 hour or to better than 1 minute (0.001%)
*the 24 hours of a day, and the equinoxes
*the periods of the planets were calculated by Mayan astronomers, to within 5 to 10 minutes accuracy in the case of Venus and Mars.

In a similar manner star occultations by the moon can be observed. By using a digital clock an accuracy of 0.2 second is possible. This represents only 200 meters at the moon&#x27;s distance of 385,000 km.

==Small objects and maps==
Observing a nearby small object without a magnifying glass or a microscope, the size of the object depends on the viewing distance. Under normal lighting conditions (light source ~ 1000 lumens at height 600–700 mm, viewing angle ~ 35 degrees) the angular size recognized by naked eye will be round 1 arc minute = 1/60 degrees = 0.0003 radians. At a viewing distance of 16&quot; = ~ 400 mm, which is considered a normal reading distance in the US, the smallest object resolution will be ~ 0.116 mm. For inspection purposes laboratories use a viewing distance of 200–250 mm, which gives the smallest size of the object recognizable to the naked eye of ~0.058–0.072 mm (58–72 micrometers). The accuracy of a measurement ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 mm and depends on the experience of the observer. The latter figure is the usual positional accuracy of faint details in maps and technical plans.

==Environmental pollution==

A clean atmosphere is indicated by the fact that the Milky Way is visible. Comparing the zenith with the horizon shows how the &quot;blue quality&quot; is degraded depending on the amount of air pollution and dust. The twinkling of a star is an indication of the turbulence of the air. This is of importance in meteorology and for the &quot;seeing&quot; of astronomy.

Light pollution is a significant problem for amateur astronomers but becomes less late at night when many lights are shut off. Air dust can be seen even far away from a city by its &quot;light dome&quot;.

<text>The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), commonly known as Fannie Mae, is a United States government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) and, since 1968, a publicly traded company. Founded in 1938 during the Great Depression as part of the New Deal, the corporation&#x27;s purpose is to expand the secondary mortgage market by securitizing mortgage loans in the form of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), allowing lenders to reinvest their assets into more lending and in effect increasing the number of lenders in the mortgage market by reducing the reliance on locally based savings and loan associations (or &quot;thrifts&quot;). Its brother organization is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), better known as Freddie Mac. 

In 2024, with over $4.3 trillion in assets, Fannie Mae is the largest company in the United States and the fifth largest company in the world, by assets. Fannie Mae was ranked number 27 on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue and was ranked number 58 on the &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500 rankings of the largest global corporations by total revenue. In terms of profit, Fannie Mae is the 15th most profitable company in the United States and the 33rd most profitable in the world.

==History==
===Background and early decades===

Historically, most housing loans in the early 1900s in the United States were short term mortgage loans with balloon payments. The Great Depression weakened the U.S. housing market, as people lost their jobs and were unable to make payments. By 1933, an estimated 20 to 25% of the nation&#x27;s outstanding mortgage debt was in default. This resulted in foreclosures in which nearly 25% of America&#x27;s homeowners lost their homes to banks. To address this, Fannie Mae was established by the U.S. Congress in 1938 by amendments to the National Housing Act as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. Originally chartered as the National Mortgage Association of Washington, the organization&#x27;s explicit purpose was to provide local banks with federal money to finance home loans in an attempt to raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing. Fannie Mae created a liquid secondary mortgage market and thereby made it possible for banks and other loan originators to issue more housing loans, primarily by buying Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgages. For the first thirty years following its inception, Fannie Mae held a monopoly over the secondary mortgage market. Other considerations may have motivated the New Deal focus on the housing market: about a third of the nation&#x27;s unemployed were in the building trade, and the government had a vested interest in getting them back to work by giving them homes to build.

Fannie Mae was acquired by the Housing and Home Finance Agency from the Federal Loan Agency as a constituent unit in 1950. In 1954, an amendment known as the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act made Fannie Mae into &quot;mixed-ownership corporation&quot;, meaning that federal government held the preferred stock while private investors held the common stock; in 1968 it converted to a privately held corporation, to remove its activity and debt from the federal budget. In the 1968 change, arising from the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, Fannie Mae&#x27;s predecessor (also called Fannie Mae) was split into the current Fannie Mae and the Government National Mortgage Association (&quot;Ginnie Mae&quot;).

Ginnie Mae, which remained a government organization, guarantees FHA-insured mortgage loans as well as Veterans Administration (VA) and Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) insured mortgages. As such, Ginnie Mae is the only home-loan agency explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.

In 1970, the federal government authorized Fannie Mae to purchase conventional loans, i.e. those not insured by the FHA, VA, or FmHA, and created the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), colloquially known as Freddie Mac, to compete with Fannie Mae and thus facilitate a more robust and efficient secondary mortgage market. That same year FNMA went public on New York and Pacific Exchanges.

In 1981, Fannie Mae issued its first mortgage pass-through and called it a &quot;mortgage-backed security&quot;. Ginnie Mae had guaranteed the first mortgage pass-through security of an approved lender in 1968 and in 1971 Freddie Mac issued its first mortgage pass-through, called a &quot;participation certificate&quot;, composed primarily of private mortgage loans.

=== 1990s ===

In 1992, President George H. W. Bush signed the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. The Act amended the charter of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reflect the Democratic Congress&#x27; view that the GSEs &quot;have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the financing of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families in a manner consistent with their overall public purposes, while maintaining a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return&quot;. For the first time, the GSEs were required to meet &quot;affordable housing goals&quot; set annually by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and approved by Congress. The initial annual goal for low-income and moderate-income mortgage purchases for each GSE was 30% of the total number of dwelling units financed by mortgage purchases and increased to 55% by 2007.

In 1999, Fannie Mae came under pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income borrowers by increasing the ratios of their loan portfolios in distressed inner city areas designated in the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977. 

In 1999, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that with the corporation&#x27;s move towards the subprime market &quot;Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.&quot;

=== 2000s ===

In 2000, because of a re-assessment of the housing market by HUD, anti-predatory lending rules were put into place that disallowed risky, high-cost loans from being credited toward affordable housing goals. In 2004, these rules were dropped and high-risk loans were again counted toward affordable housing goals.

The intent was that Fannie Mae&#x27;s enforcement of the underwriting standards they maintained for standard conforming mortgages would also provide safe and stable means of lending to buyers who did not have prime credit. As Daniel Mudd, then president and CEO of Fannie Mae, testified in 2007, instead the agency&#x27;s underwriting requirements drove business into the arms of the private mortgage industry who marketed aggressive products without regard to future consequences:

Alex Berenson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2003 that Fannie Mae&#x27;s risk was much larger than was commonly believed. Nassim Taleb wrote in &quot;The Black Swan&quot;: &quot;The government-sponsored institution Fannie Mae, when I look at its risks, seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite, vulnerable to the slightest hiccup. But not to worry: their large staff of scientists deem these events &#x27;unlikely&#x27;&quot;.

On January 26, 2005, the &quot;Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005&quot; (S.190) was first introduced by U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel. The Senate legislation was an effort to reform the existing GSE regulatory structure in light of the recent accounting problems and questionable management actions leading to considerable income restatements by the GSEs. After being reported favorably by the Senate&#x27;s Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in July 2005, the bill was never considered by the full Senate for a vote. Sen. John McCain&#x27;s decision to become a cosponsor of S.190 almost a year later in 2006 was the last action taken regarding Sen. Hagel&#x27;s bill in spite of developments since clearing the Senate Committee. McCain pointed out that Fannie Mae&#x27;s regulator reported that profits were &quot;illusions deliberately and systematically created by the company&#x27;s senior management&quot; in his floor statement giving support to S.190.

At the same time, the House also introduced similar legislation, the &quot;Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2005&quot; (H.R. 1461), in the spring of 2005. The House Financial Services Committee had crafted changes and produced a committee report by July 2005 for the legislation. It was passed by the House in October in spite of President George W. Bush&#x27;s opposition to the House version, which stated: &quot;The regulatory regime envisioned by H.R. 1461 is considerably weaker than that which governs other large, complex financial institutions.&quot; The legislation met with opposition from both Democrats and Republicans at that point and the Senate never took up the House passed version for consideration after that.

===The mortgage crisis from late 2007===
Following their mission to meet federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housing goals, GSEs such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) had striven to improve home ownership of low and middle income families, underserved areas, and generally through special affordable methods such as &quot;the ability to obtain a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a low down payment ... and the continuous availability of mortgage credit under a wide range of economic conditions&quot;. Then in 2003–2004, the subprime mortgage crisis began. The market shifted away from regulated GSEs and radically toward Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) issued by unregulated private-label securitization (PLS) conduits, typically operated by investment banks.

As loan originators began to distribute more and more of their loans through private label PLS&#x27;s, the GSEs lost the ability to monitor and control loan originators. Competition between the GSEs and private securitizers for loans further undermined GSEs&#x27; power and strengthened mortgage originators. This contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the financial crisis.

Investment bank securitizers were more willing to securitize risky loans because they generally retained minimal risk. Whereas the GSEs guaranteed the performance of their mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), private securitizers generally did not, and might only retain a thin slice of risk. Often, banks would offload this risk to insurance companies or other counterparties through credit default swaps, making their actual risk exposures extremely difficult for investors and creditors to discern.

The shift toward riskier mortgages and private label MBS distribution occurred as financial institutions sought to maintain earnings levels that had been elevated during 2001–2003 by an unprecedented refinancing boom due to historically low interest rates. Earnings depended on volume, so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower underwriting standards and new products that the GSEs would not (initially) securitize. Thus, the shift away from GSE securitization to private-label securitization (PLS) also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type, from traditional, amortizing, fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to nontraditional, structurally riskier, nonamortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM&#x27;s), and in the start of a sharp deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards. The growth of PLS, however, forced the GSEs to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders. Shareholder pressure pushed the GSEs into competition with PLS for market share, and the GSEs loosened their guarantee business underwriting standards in order to compete. In contrast, the wholly public FHA/Ginnie Mae maintained their underwriting standards and instead ceded market share.

The growth of private-label securitization and lack of regulation in this part of the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance that led, in 2006, to an increasing number of borrowers, often with poor credit, who were unable to pay their mortgages – particularly with adjustable rate mortgage loans (ARM), caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures. As a result, home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter lending standards made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get loans. This depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the GSEs, which back the majority of US mortgages. In July 2008, the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that &quot;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in the US housing finance system&quot;. The US Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks) and removing the prohibition on the Treasury Department to purchase the GSEs&#x27; stock. Despite these efforts, by August 2008, shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had tumbled more than 90% from their one-year prior levels.

=== 2008 – crisis and conservatorship ===

On July 11, 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that U.S. government officials were considering a plan for the U.S. government to take over Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac should their financial situations worsen due to the U.S. housing crisis. Fannie Mae and smaller Freddie Mac owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the United States and so were especially hard hit by the slump. The government officials also stated that the government had also considered calling for explicit government guarantee through legislation of $5 trillion on debt owned or guaranteed by the two companies.

Fannie stock plunged. Some worried that Fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt. Others worried about a government seizure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson as well as the White House went on the air to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic. Fannie and Freddie underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.&#x27;s $12 trillion mortgage market (). If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive. Fannie and Freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people. If they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.

The Administration PR effort was not enough, by itself, to save the GSEs. Their government directive to purchase bad loans from private banks, in order to prevent these banks from failing, as well as the 20 top banks falsely classifying loans as AAA, caused instability. Paulson&#x27;s plan was to go in swiftly and seize the two GSEs, rather than provide loans as he did for AIG and the major banks; he told president Bush that &quot;the first sound they hear will be their heads hitting the floor&quot;, in a reference to the French Revolution. The major banks have since been sued by the Feds for a sum of $200,000,000, and some of the major banks have already settled.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 9/2/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a lawsuit has been filed against the federal government by the shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for a) creating an environment by which Fannie and Freddie would be unable to meet their financial obligations b) forcing the executive management to sign over the companies to the conservator by (a), and c) the gross violation of the (fifth amendment) taking clause.

On September 7, 2008, James Lockhart, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were being placed into conservatorship of the FHFA. The action was &quot;one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades&quot;. Lockhart also dismissed the firms&#x27; chief executive officers and boards of directors, and caused the issuance to the Treasury new senior preferred stock and common stock warrants amounting to 79.9% of each GSE. The value of the common stock and preferred stock to pre-conservatorship holders was greatly diminished by the suspension of future dividends on previously outstanding stock, in the effort to maintain the value of company debt and of mortgage-backed securities. FHFA stated that there are no plans to liquidate the company.

The authority of the U.S. Treasury to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac is limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to. The July 30, 2008, law enabling expanded regulatory authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac increased the national debt ceiling by US$800 billion (), to a total of US$10.7 trillion in anticipation of the potential need for the Treasury to have the flexibility to support the federal home loan banks.

=== 2010 – delisting ===
On June 16, 2010, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced their stocks would be delisted from the NYSE. The Federal Housing Finance Agency directed the delisting after Fannie&#x27;s stock traded below $1 a share for over 30 days. Since then the stocks have continued to trade on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.

=== Dividends paid to government ===
In May 2013, Fannie Mae announced that it is going to pay a dividend of $59.4 billion () to the United States Treasury.

In 2014, gross flows were:
* $116 billion received from Treasury
* $134 billion paid to Treasury ()

Fannie Mae&#x27;s 2014 financial results enabled it to pay $20.6 billion in dividends to Treasury for the year, resulting in a cumulative total of $134.5 billion in dividends through December 31, 2014 – approximately $18 billion more than Fannie Mae received in support. As of March 31, 2015, Fannie Mae expects to have paid a total of $136.4 billion in payments to the Treasury.

=== 2015 ruling ===
On May 11, 2015 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that A U.S. District Court judge said Nomura Holdings Inc. was not truthful in describing mortgage-backed securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, giving a victory to the companies&#x27; conservator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Judge Denise Cote asked the FHFA to propose updated damages to be paid by Nomura and co-defendant RBS Securities Inc., which underwrote some of the investments. At the outset of the case, the FHFA asked for about $1.1 billion. The order brought to conclusion a rare trial addressing alleged mortgage-related infractions committed during the housing boom. Over the past few years, more than a dozen firms chose to settle similar allegations brought by the FHFA rather than face a court battle. The settlements have brought Fannie and Freddie $18 billion in penalties. In her decision, Judge Cote wrote that Nomura, in offering documents for mortgage-backed securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, didn&#x27;t accurately describe the loans&#x27; quality. &quot;The magnitude of falsity, conservatively measured, is enormous&quot;, she wrote. During the boom, Fannie and Freddie invested billions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities issued by such companies as Nomura. Those investments bolstered profits but, in the bust, contributed to steep losses that ultimately resulted in the companies&#x27; 2008 government takeover. Nomura and RBS were two of 18 financial institutions, including Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., targeted in 2011 by the FHFA, which alleged that the companies lied about the quality of the loans underlying the securities. During the nonjury trial, lawyers for the FHFA said that Nomura and RBS inflated values of homes behind some mortgages and sometimes said a home was owner-occupied when it was not.

==Business==
Fannie Mae makes money partly by borrowing at low rates, and then reinvesting its borrowings into whole mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities. It borrows in the debt markets by selling bonds, and provides liquidity to loan originators by purchasing whole loans. It purchases whole loans and then securitizes them for the investment market by creating MBS that are either retained or sold.

As a Government Sponsored Enterprise, or GSE, Fannie Mae is compelled by law to provide liquidity to loan originators in all economic conditions. It must legally ignore adverse market conditions which appear to be unprofitable. If there are loans available for purchase that meet its predetermined underwriting standards, it must purchase them if no other buyers are available. Because of the size, scale, and scope of the United States single-family residential and commercial residential markets, market participants viewed Fannie Mae corporate debt as having a very high probability of being repaid. Fannie Mae is able to borrow very inexpensively in the debt markets as a consequence of market perception. There usually exists a large difference between the rate at which it can borrow and the rate at which it can &#x27;lend&#x27;. This was called &quot;The big, fat gap&quot; by Alan Greenspan. By August 2008, Fannie Mae&#x27;s mortgage portfolio was in excess of $700 billion ().

Fannie Mae also earns a significant portion of its income from guaranty fees it receives as compensation for assuming the credit risk on mortgage loans underlying its single-family Fannie Mae MBS and on the single-family mortgage loans held in its retained portfolio. Investors, or purchasers of Fannie Mae MBSs, are willing to let Fannie Mae keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk; that is, Fannie Mae&#x27;s guarantee that the scheduled principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid even if the borrower defaults.

Fannie Mae&#x27;s charter has historically prevented it from guaranteeing loans with a loan-to-values over 80% without mortgage insurance or a repurchase agreement with the lender; however, in 2006 and 2007 Fannie Mae did purchase subprime and Alt-A loans as investments.

===Business mechanism===

Fannie Mae is a purchaser of mortgages loans and the mortgages that secure them, which it packages into mortgaged-backed securities (MBS). Fannie Mae buys loans from approved mortgage sellers and securitizes them; it then sells the resultant mortgage-backed security to investors in the secondary mortgage market, along with a guarantee that the stated principal and interest payments will be timely passed through to the investor.. In addition, Fannie MBS, like those of Freddie Mac MBS and Ginnie Mae MBS, are eligible to be traded in the &quot;to-be-announced&quot; or &quot;TBA&quot; market. By purchasing the mortgages, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide banks and other financial institutions with fresh money to make new loans. This gives the United States housing and credit markets flexibility and liquidity.

In order for Fannie Mae to provide its guarantee to mortgage-backed securities it issues, it sets the guidelines for the loans that it will accept for purchase, called &quot;conforming&quot; loans. Fannie Mae produced an automated underwriting system (AUS) tool called Desktop Underwriter (DU) which lenders can use to automatically determine if a loan is conforming; Fannie Mae followed this program up in 2004 with Custom DU, which allows lenders to set custom underwriting rules to handle nonconforming loans as well. The secondary market for nonconforming loans includes jumbo loans, which are loans larger than the maximum that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase. In early 2008, the decision was made to allow TBA (To-be-announced)-eligible mortgage-backed securities to include up to 10% &quot;jumbo&quot; loans.

=== Conforming loans ===
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a limit on the maximum sized loan they will guarantee. This is known as the &quot;conforming loan limit&quot;. The conforming loan limit for Fannie Mae, along with Freddie Mac, is set by Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the regulator of both GSEs. OFHEO annually sets the limit of the size of a conforming loan based on the October to October changes in mean home price, above which a mortgage is considered a non-conforming jumbo loan. The conforming loan limit is 50 percent higher in Alaska and Hawaii. The GSEs only buy loans that are conforming to repackage into the secondary market, lowering the demand for non-conforming loans. By virtue of the law of supply and demand, then, it is harder for lenders to sell these loans in the secondary market; thus these types of loans tend to cost more to borrowers (typically 1/4 to 1/2 of a percent). Indeed, in 2008, since the demand for bonds not guaranteed by GSEs was almost non-existent, non-conforming loans were priced nearly 1% to 1.5% higher than conforming loans.

=== Implicit guarantee and government support ===
Originally, Fannie had an &#x27;explicit guarantee&#x27; from the government; if it got in trouble, the government promised to bail it out. This changed in 1968. Ginnie Mae was split off from Fannie. Ginnie retained the explicit guarantee. Fannie, however, became a private corporation, chartered by Congress and with a direct line of credit to the US Treasury. It was its nature as a Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) that provided the &#x27;implied guarantee&#x27; for their borrowing. The charter also limited their business activity to the mortgage market. In this regard, although they were a private company, they could not operate like a regular private company.

Fannie Mae received no direct government funding or backing; Fannie Mae securities carried no actual explicit government guarantee of being repaid. This was clearly stated in the law that authorizes GSEs, on the securities themselves, and in many public communications issued by Fannie Mae. Neither the certificates nor payments of principal and interest on the certificates were explicitly guaranteed by the United States government. The certificates did not legally constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than Fannie Mae. During the sub-prime era, every Fannie Mae prospectus read in bold, all-caps letters: &quot;The certificates and payments of principal and interest on the certificates are not guaranteed by the United States, and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than Fannie Mae.&quot; (Verbiage changed from all-caps to standard case for readability).

However, the implied guarantee, as well as various special treatments given to Fannie by the government, greatly enhanced its success.

For example, the implied guarantee allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to save billions in borrowing costs, as their credit rating was very good. Estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Treasury Department put the figure at about $2 billion per year. Vernon L. Smith, recipient of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, has called FHLMC and FNMA &quot;implicitly taxpayer-backed agencies&quot;. The Economist has referred to &quot;the implicit government guarantee&quot; of FHLMC and FNMA. In testimony before the House and Senate Banking Committee in 2004, Alan Greenspan expressed the belief that Fannie Mae&#x27;s (weak) financial position was the result of markets believing that the U.S. Government would never allow Fannie Mae (or Freddie Mac) to fail.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were allowed to hold less capital than normal financial institutions: e.g., they were allowed to sell mortgage-backed securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions. Regulations exist through the FDIC Bank Holding Company Act that govern the solvency of financial institutions. The regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capital/asset ratio greater than or equal to 3%. The GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are exempt from this capital/asset ratio requirement and can, and often do, maintain a capital/asset ratio less than 3%. The additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times, but put the companies at greater risk in bad times, such as during the subprime mortgage crisis. FNMA is exempt from state and local taxes, except for certain taxes on real estate. In addition, FNMA and FHLMC are exempt from SEC filing requirements; they file SEC 10-K and 10-Q reports, but many other reports, such as certain reports regarding their REMIC mortgage securities, are not filed.

Lastly, money market funds have diversification requirements, so that not more than 5% of assets may be from the same issuer. That is, a worst-case default would drop a fund not more than five percent. However, these rules do not apply to Fannie and Freddie. It would not be unusual to find a fund that had the vast majority of its assets in Fannie and Freddie debt.

In 1996, the Congressional Budget Office wrote &quot;there have been no federal appropriations for cash payments or guarantee subsidies. But in the place of federal funds the government provides considerable unpriced benefits to the enterprises ... Government-sponsored enterprises are costly to the government and taxpayers ... the benefit is currently worth $6.5 billion annually.&quot;

===Accounting===

FNMA is a financial corporation which uses derivatives to &quot;hedge&quot; its cash flow. Derivative products it uses include interest rate swaps and options to enter interest rate swaps (&quot;pay-fixed swaps&quot;, &quot;receive-fixed swaps&quot;, &quot;basis swaps&quot;, &quot;interest rate caps and swaptions&quot;, &quot;forward starting swaps&quot;). Duration gap is a financial and accounting term for the difference between the duration of assets and liabilities, and is typically used by banks, pension funds, or other financial institutions to measure their risk due to changes in the interest rate. &quot;The company said that in April its average duration gap widened to plus 3 months in April from zero in March.&quot; &quot;The Washington-based company aims to keep its duration gap between minus 6 months to plus 6 months. From September 2003 to March, the gap has run between plus to minus one month.&quot;

==Controversies==

===Accounting controversy===
In late 2004, Fannie Mae was under investigation for its accounting practices. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight released a report on September 20, 2004, alleging widespread accounting errors.

Fannie Mae was expected to spend more than $1 billion () in 2006 alone to complete its internal audit and bring it closer to compliance. The necessary restatement was expected to cost $10.8 billion, but was completed at a total cost of $6.3 billion in restated earnings as listed in Fannie Mae&#x27;s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Concerns with business and accounting practices at Fannie Mae predate the scandal itself. On June 15, 2000, the House Banking Subcommittee On Capital Markets, Securities And Government-Sponsored Enterprises held hearings on Fannie Mae.

On December 18, 2006, U.S. regulators filed 101 civil charges against chief executive Franklin Raines; chief financial officer J. Timothy Howard; and the former controller Leanne G. Spencer. The three were accused of manipulating Fannie Mae earnings to maximize their bonuses. The lawsuit sought to recoup more than $115 million () in bonus payments, collectively accrued by the trio from 1998 to 2004, and about $100 million in penalties for their involvement in the accounting scandal. After 8 years of litigation, in 2012, a summary judgment was issued clearing the trio, indicating the government had insufficient evidence that would enable any jury to find the defendants guilty.

===Conflict of interest===
In June 2008, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that two former CEOs of Fannie Mae, James A. Johnson and Franklin Raines, had received loans below market rate from Countrywide Financial. Fannie Mae was the biggest buyer of Countrywide&#x27;s mortgages. The &quot;Friends of Angelo&quot; VIP Countrywide loan program included many people from Fannie Mae; lawyers, executives, etc.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have given contributions to lawmakers currently sitting on committees that primarily regulate their industry: The House Financial Services Committee; the Senate Banking, Housing &amp; Urban Affairs Committee; or the Senate Finance Committee. The others have seats on the powerful Appropriations or Ways &amp; Means committees, are members of the congressional leadership or have run for president.

===2011 SEC charges===

In December 2011, six Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives, including Daniel Mudd, were charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with securities fraud. &quot;The SEC alleges they &#x27;knew and approved of&#x27; misleading statements claiming the companies had minimal exposure to subprime loans at the height of home mortgage bubble.&quot; Former Freddie chief financial officer Anthony &quot;Buddy&quot; Piszel, who in February 2011, was CFO of CoreLogic, &quot;had received a notice from the SEC that the agency was considering taking action against him&quot;. He then resigned from CoreLogic. Piszel was not among the executives charged in December 2011. Piszel had been succeeded at Freddie by David Kellermann. Kellermann committed suicide during his tenure at Freddie.

A contemporaneous report on the SEC charges continued:
The SEC said Mudd&#x27;s misconduct included knowingly giving false testimony to Congress.
Mudd said last week that the government approved Fannie Mae&#x27;s disclosures during his tenure.
&quot;Now it appears that the government has negotiated a deal to hold the government, and government-appointed executives who have signed the same disclosures since my departure, blameless – so that it can sue individuals it fired years ago,&quot; he said in a statement last week.

===2011 lawsuits===

In 2011, the agency had a number of other big banks in the crosshairs as well. JPMorgan Chase was one of 18 financial institutions the FHFA sued back in 2011, accusing them of selling to Fannie and Freddie securities that &quot;had different and more risky characteristics than the descriptions contained in the marketing and sales materials&quot;. Fannie and Freddie, the government-backed housing finance firms, sustained massive losses on mortgage-backed securities as the housing market imploded, requiring a bailout of over $187 billion. The firms have been controlled by the FHFA since their 2008 rescue. Swiss lender UBS has already reached an $885 million settlement with the FHFA in connection with losses Fannie and Freddie sustained on over $6.4 billion worth of mortgage securities. The agency also settled for undisclosed sums earlier this year with Citigroup and General Electric. The FHFA is reportedly seeking $4 billion from JPMorgan to resolve its claims over $33 billion worth of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie by JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and WaMu. Bank of America (BAC), which acquired Countrywide and Merrill Lynch during the crisis era, could be on the hook for even more. The Charlotte-based firm is facing claims from the FHFA over $57 billion worth of mortgage bonds. In all, the 18 FHFA lawsuits cover more than $200 billion in allegedly misrepresented securities. The question of whether any individual bankers will be held to account is another matter. Thus far, criminal cases related to the packaging and sale of mortgage-backed securities have been conspicuously absent. The proposed JPMorgan settlement covers only civil charges, and would not settle the question of whether any individual executives engaged in wrongdoing. There is an ongoing federal criminal probe based in Sacramento, Calif., the state where Washington Mutual was based. JPMorgan originally sought to be protected from any criminal charges as part of this deal, but that request was rejected by the government.

===2013 allegations of kickbacks===
On May 29, 2013, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that a former foreclosure specialist at Fannie Mae has been charged but pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot; to accepting a kickback from an Arizona real estate broker in a Santa Ana Federal court. Another lawsuit filed earlier in Orange County Superior Court, this one for wrongful termination, has been filed against Fannie Mae by an employee who claims she was fired when she tried to alert management to kickbacks. The employee claims that she started voicing her suspicions in 2009.

==Related legislation==

On May 8, 2013, Representative Scott Garrett introduced the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill, if it were passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.

<text>Haeinsa () is a Buddhist temple in Gayasan National Park, South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It is the head temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Seon Buddhism. Haeinsa is most notable for being the home of the &quot;Tripitaka Koreana,&quot; the whole of the Buddhist Scriptures carved onto 81,350 wooden printing blocks, which it has housed since 1398.

Haeinsa is one of the Three Jewels Temples, and represents Dharma or the Buddha’s teachings. It is still an active Seon practice center in modern times, and was the home temple of the influential Seon master Seongcheol, who died in 1993.

==History==
The temple was first built in 802. Legend says that two monks of royal Daegaya descent, Suneung and Ijeong, returned from Tang China and healed Aejang of Silla&#x27;s wife of her illness. In gratitude for Gautama Buddha&#x27;s mercy, the king ordered the construction of the temple. Another account, by Choe Chi-Won in 900 states that Suneung and his disciple Ijeong, gained the support of a queen dowager who converted to Buddhism and then helped to finance the construction of the temple.

The temple complex was renovated in the 10th century, 1488, 1622, and 1644, respectively. Huirang, the temple abbot enjoyed the patronage of Taejo of Goryeo during that king’s reign. Haeinsa was burned down in a fire in 1817 and was rebuilt in 1818. Another renovation in 1964 uncovered a royal robe of Gwanghaegun of Joseon, who was responsible for the 1622 renovation, and an inscription on a ridge beam.

The main hall, Daejeokkwangjeon (대적광전, 大寂光殿: Hall of Great Silence and Light), is unusual because it is dedicated to Vairocana, whereas most other Korean temples house images of Gautama Buddha in their main halls.

The Temple of Haeinsa and the Depositories for the &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot; Woodblocks were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The UNESCO committee noted that the buildings housing the Tripiṭaka Koreana are unique because no other historical structure was specifically dedicated to the preservation of artifacts and the techniques used were particularly ingenious.

The temple also holds several official treasures including a realistic wooden carving of a monk and interesting Buddhist paintings, stone pagodas, and lanterns.

===Crisis===
During the Korean War, the area surrounding Haeinsa Temple was a site of conflict between North Korean guerillas and the allied forces of South Korea and the United Nations Command. In September of 1951, during an anti-guerilla bombing campaign, Air Force Colonel Kim Young-hwan was ordered to destroy the temple. He refused, instead leading his squad of fighter jets over the temple without dropping a single bomb.

==Janggyeong Panjeon (National Treasure No. 32)==

The storage halls known as the Janggyeong Panjeon complex are the depository for the &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot; woodblocks at Haeinsa and were also designated by the Korean government as a National Treasure on December 20, 1962. They are some of the largest wooden storage facilities in the world. Remarkably, the halls were untouched during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) and were spared from the 1818 fire that burned most of the temple complex down. All told, the storage halls have survived seven serious fires and one near-bombing during the Korean War when a pilot disobeyed orders because he remembered that the temple held priceless treasures.

Janggyeong Panjeon complex is the oldest part of the temple and houses the 81,258 wooden printing blocks from the &quot;Tripiṭaka Koreana&quot;. Although the exact construction date of the hall that houses the Tripiṭaka Koreana is uncertain, it is believed that Sejo of Joseon expanded and renovated it in 1457. The complex is made up of four halls arranged in a rectangle and the style is very plain because of its use as a storage facility. The northern hall is called Beopbojeon (Hall of Dharma) and the southern hall is called the &quot;Sudara-jang&quot; (&quot;Hall of Sutras&quot;). These two main halls are 60.44 meters in length, 8.73 meters in width, and 7.8 meters in height. Both have fifteen rooms with two adjoining rooms. Additionally, there are two small halls on the east and west which house two small libraries.

Several ingenious preservation techniques are utilized to preserve the wooden printing blocks. The architects also utilized nature to help preserve the Tripitaka. The storage complex was built at the highest point of the temple and is 655 meters above sea level. Janggyeong Panjeon faces southwest to avoid damp southeasterly winds from the valley below and is blocked from the cold north wind by mountain peaks. Different sized windows on the north and south sides of both main halls are used for ventilation, utilizing principles of hydrodynamics. The windows were installed in every hall to maximize ventilation and regulate temperature. The clay floors were filled with charcoal, calcium oxide, salt, lime, and sand, which reduce humidity when it rains by absorbing excess moisture which is then retained during the dry winter months. The roof is also made with clay and the bracketing and wood rafters prevent sudden changes in temperature. Additionally, no part of the complex is exposed to sun. Apparently, animals, insects, and birds avoid the complex but the reason for this is unknown. These sophisticated preservation measures are widely credited as the reason the woodblocks have survived in such fantastic condition to this day.

In 1970, a modern storage complex was built utilizing modern preservation techniques but when test woodblocks were found to have mildewed, the intended move was canceled and the woodblocks remained at Haeinsa.

<text>Liu Chen (; died December 263), the Prince of Beidi (北地王), was the fifth son of Liu Shan, the second ruler of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Liu Chen opposed the plans of Qiao Zhou to surrender to the opposing force under general Deng Ai from the rival state of Cao Wei. Liu Chen attempted to convince his father to fight for the honour of Shu, so Liu Bei (the founder of Shu) could look upon him as a redeemed ruler of Shu. However, Liu Shan threw Liu Chen out of the court for this. He then went to Liu Bei&#x27;s ancestral temple and killed his wife and children before committing suicide.

Liu Chen is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (無雙譜, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang.

Liu Chen&#x27;s story is reenacted in a play of the Yue opera.

<doc id="293566" wikidata="Q7911344" url="?curid=293566" title="Valerie Singleton">
<text>Valerie Singleton (born 9 April 1937) is an English television and radio presenter best known as a regular presenter of the popular children&#x27;s series &quot;Blue Peter&quot; from 1962 to 1972. She also presented the BBC Radio 4 &quot;PM&quot; programme for ten years, as well as a series of radio and television programmes on financial and business issues, including BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Money Programme&quot; from 1980 to 1988.

==Early life==
Valerie Singleton was born on 9 April 1937 in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, the daughter of ex-RAF wing commander Dennis Singleton OBE, later an advertising executive with J.W.Thompson, and Eileen Singleton LRAM (&quot;née&quot; Reed). She studied dancing at the Arts Educational School, London, and at the age of twelve, appeared as a young dancer in Cinderella at the Finsbury Park Empire. When Singleton was 16, she danced in &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Edinburgh, with Stanley Baxter playing Wishee Washee, and she was also a young singer in the Ovaltineys. She went on to spend two years at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, winning a scholarship for her first term, and she began her career as an actress at the New Theatre in Bromley.

==Career==
===Career beginnings and acting work===
For several years Singleton pursued her acting career, including Nest of Robins, a No 1 Tour starring Jessie Mathews and Sonnie Hale. In 1959, she starred in the BBC television sitcom &quot;The Adventures of Brigadier Wellington-Bull&quot;. She began presenting on BBC Radio in 1963, hosting &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; for the Light Programme. She was also a reporter on BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Time Out&quot; in 1964. She became a voice over commentator for television commercials and presented, with Arnold a cartoon character, the &quot;Arnold Doodle Show&quot; on ITV on Sundays.

===&quot;Blue Peter&quot;===
Singleton joined the BBC in 1961 as a television continuity announcer and on 3 September 1962 joined &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, where she remained as a regular weekly presenter until 3 July 1972. In 1971, Singleton accompanied Princess Anne (later the Princess Royal) to Kenya on the Princess&#x27;s first overseas trip as the newly assigned President of The Save The Children Fund, for the film &quot;Blue Peter Royal Safari&quot;. In 1998, the two women met to reminisce about the Royal safari for &quot;Blue Peter&quot;″s fortieth anniversary programmes. At Christmas 1971 Singleton and the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenting team hosted the annual &quot;Disney Time&quot; on BBC1.

The documentary &quot;Blue Peter Royal Safari&quot; led to the spin-off series, &quot;Blue Peter Special Assignments&quot;, in which Singleton was solo presenter. It was shown at weekends and ran from 1973 to 1981. Initially each edition focused on European capital cities, but later covered islands and the homes of well-known historic figures. After making the last of her &quot;in studio&quot; appearances on &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in October 1975, she was featured as part of the end-of-year &quot;review&quot;. She returned in January 1976 to mark the death of the first &quot;Blue Peter&quot; cat, Jason. Just a few weeks later, producer Edward Barnes wrote to tell her that as she was no longer associated with the show in any genuine sense, they were replacing her as the presenter of the &quot;Special Assignment&quot; series. Her fees were reportedly a factor in their decision.

The programme continued to repeat items featuring Singleton for many years and she returned for a final series of the &quot;Special Assignment&quot; spin-off in 1981 reporting on the Yukon and Niagara Rivers. For both the 20th and 25th anniversary editions of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in 1978 and 1983 respectively, Singleton moderated the live link-ups from around the UK to launch the anniversary badge balloon hunts, thus extending her presenting tenure to 21 years. As a guest, she presented the &quot;Outstanding Endeavour&quot; award to its young recipient on the programme&#x27;s 30th anniversary edition. Richard Marson states in his &quot;Blue Peter 50th Anniversary&quot; book that &quot;Singleton never really left Blue Peter&quot;.

During her time on &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, Singleton presented another BBC children&#x27;s show, &quot;Val Meets The VIPs&quot;, a chat show that ran for three series during 1973–74. Each edition featured an interview with a single public figure to which an audience of children were invited to put across their questions. A guest in March 1973 was the then Secretary of State for Education Margaret Thatcher, who when asked if she would like to be Prime Minister said that she did not have enough experience, nor would there be a &quot;woman Prime Minister in my lifetime&quot;.

===Later work===

Having co-hosted a special programme about Metrication in July 1973, she joined &quot;Nationwide&quot; in October 1973 as the show&#x27;s &quot;Consumer Unit&quot; presenter with Richard Stilgoe, later becoming one of the main hosts of the show. Singleton was the co-anchor of &quot;Nationwide&quot;″s royal wedding coverage in November 1973. She left &quot;Nationwide&quot; in 1978 to present the BBC&#x27;s late-night news programme &quot;Tonight&quot;, replacing Sue Lawley. In 1980, she was the presenter of BBC2&#x27;s series &quot;A Kind of Childhood&quot;. She made a brief return to &quot;Nationwide&quot; in the summer of 1983, presenting a series of films looking at people forced to leave their homeland and settle in Britain.

Singleton hosted many other programmes, notably undertaking a ten-year stint on the Monday-to-Friday BBC Radio 4 &quot;PM&quot; programme beginning in 1982 (having previously presented the station&#x27;s &quot;Midweek with Valerie Singleton&quot;) and eight years presenting BBC2&#x27;s &quot;The Money Programme&quot; from September 1980 to March 1988. While hosting &quot;PM&quot;, Singleton admitted she had a difficult relationship with co-presenter Hugh Sykes and threw a cup of water in his face while live on air. For the 1983 UK General Election held on 9 June, Singleton covered the results from two constituencies, Torbay and Truro. She interviewed the winning candidates, Frederic Bennett (Torbay) and David Penhaligon (Truro), after the results for the BBC&#x27;s Election results programming.

When she left &quot;PM&quot; in 1993, she presented a travel programme for ITV and became a regular travel writer for several national publications. She made a one-off return to &quot;PM&quot; on 29 February 2016 to co-present a special &quot;Leap Day&quot; programme, alongside Eddie Mair. In 1994, she was awarded the OBE for her services to children&#x27;s television.

In the 1990s, Singleton presented the quiz show &quot;Backdate&quot; on Channel 4. In the late 1990s, she presented 12 episodes of &quot;Playback&quot; for the History Channel, a programme that asked well-known figures about events that have influenced the course of their lives. In 2019, she appeared in &quot;Can I Improve My Memory?&quot; for Channel 4. She was an early enthusiast for and patron of the painter Jack Vettriano. In 2005, the story of Singleton&#x27;s move from London to Dorset and the sale of the flat she had lived in for more than forty years was reported in &quot;The Times&quot;.

Singleton was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2001, when she was surprised by Michael Aspel. Earlier, in 1974, she had been the featured castaway on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

==Personal life==
Singleton has never married or had children. In an interview, she said she had several partners over the years. She had a relationship with actor Albert Finney. Whilst on &quot;Blue Peter&quot; she had an abortion and during her time as a presenter she had a brief fling with her co-star Peter Purves. She was also once engaged to radio presenter and DJ Pete Murray. She lives in Templecombe, Somerset.

<doc id="293567" wikidata="Q352422" url="?curid=293567" title="Mike Gravel">
<text>Maurice Robert &quot;Mike&quot; Gravel ( ; May 13, 1930 – June 26, 2021) was an American politician and writer who represented Alaska in the United States Senate from 1969 to 1981 as a member of the Democratic Party. He ran for president twice: in 2008, and 2020. He was the 4th US Senator in all of Alaska history. During the Vietnam war, he submitted legislation to end the draft. He later ran in Democrat presidential primaries and became active in trying to establish a national direct-referendum process.

Born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, by French-Canadian immigrant parents, Gravel moved to Alaska in the late 1950s, becoming a real estate developer and entering politics. He served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1963 to 1967, and also became Speaker of the Alaska House. Gravel was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1968.

As a senator, Gravel became nationally known for his forceful, but unsuccessful, attempts to end the draft during the War in Vietnam, and for putting the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; into the public record in 1971. He conducted an unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then played a crucial role in obtaining Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in in 1974, but was defeated in his bid for a third term in the primary election in 1980.

An advocate of direct democracy and the National Initiative, Gravel staged a run for the 2008 Democratic nomination for President of the United States. His campaign failed to gain support, and in March 2008, he left the Democratic Party, and joined the Libertarian Party, to compete unsuccessfully for its presidential nomination and the inclusion of the National Initiative into the Libertarian Platform. He ran for president as a Democrat again in the 2020 election, in a campaign that ended four months after it began. Two years before his death, Gravel and his campaign staff founded the progressive think tank The Gravel Institute.

==Early life, military service, education==
Gravel was born on May 13, 1930, in Springfield, Massachusetts, one of five children of French-Canadian immigrant parents, Alphonse and Marie (née Bourassa) Gravel. His parents were part of the Quebec diaspora, and he was raised in a working-class neighborhood during the Great Depression, speaking only French until he was seven years old. Calling him &quot;Mike&quot; from an early age, his father valued work above all else, while his mother stressed the importance of education.

Gravel was educated in parochial schools as a Roman Catholic. There he struggled, due to what he later said was undiagnosed dyslexia, and was left back in third grade. He completed elementary school in 1945 and his class voted him &quot;most charming personality&quot;. A summer job as a soda jerk led to Gravel handing out campaign fliers for local candidates on his boss&#x27;s behalf; Gravel was immediately impressed with &quot;the awesomeness of political office&quot;.

Gravel then boarded at Assumption Preparatory School in Worcester, Massachusetts, where his performance was initially mediocre. By Gravel&#x27;s telling, in the summer of 1948 he intended to volunteer for the Israel Defense Forces during the 1947–1949 Palestine war, but Alexandra Tolstaya told him to return to school. There an English teacher, the Assumptionist Edgar Bourque, gave him personal attention, improving Gravel&#x27;s language skills and instructing him in public speaking. Gravel&#x27;s grades improved measurably in his final year and he graduated in 1949. His sister, Marguerite, became a Holy Cross nun, but Gravel himself struggled with the Catholic faith. He studied for one year at Assumption College, a Catholic school in Worcester, then transferred for his sophomore year to American International College in Springfield. Journalist I. F. Stone and philosopher Bertrand Russell strongly influenced Gravel in their willingness to challenge assumptions and oppose social convention and political authority.

Around May 1951, Gravel saw that he was about to be drafted and instead enlisted in the U.S. Army for a three-year term so that he could get into the Counterintelligence Corps. After basic training and counterintelligence school at Fort Holabird in Maryland and in South Carolina, he went to Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia. While he expected to be sent off to the Korean War when he graduated as a second lieutenant in early 1952, he was instead assigned to Stuttgart, West Germany, as a Special Adjutant in the Army&#x27;s Communications Intelligence Service. In Germany, Gravel conducted surveillance operations on civilians and paid off spies. After about a year, he transferred to Orléans, France, where his French language abilities (if not his French-Canadian accent) allowed him to infiltrate French communist rallies. He worked as a Special Agent in the Counterintelligence Corps until 1954, eventually becoming a first lieutenant.

Following his discharge, Gravel entered the Columbia University School of General Studies in New York City, where he studied economics and received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1956. He moved to New York &quot;flat broke&quot; and supported himself by working as a bar boy in a hotel, driving a taxicab, and working in the investment bond department at Bankers Trust. During this time he left the Roman Catholic faith.

==Move to Alaska==

Gravel &quot;decided to become a pioneer in a faraway place,&quot; and moved to pre-statehood Alaska in August 1956, without funds or a job, looking for a place where someone without social or political connections could be a viable candidate for public office. Alaska&#x27;s voting age of 19, less than most other states&#x27; 21, played a role in his decision, as did its newness and cooler climate. Broke when he arrived, he immediately found work in real estate sales until winter arrived. Gravel then was employed as a brakeman for the Alaska Railroad, working the snow-clearing train on the Anchorage-to-Fairbanks run. Subsequently, he opened a small real estate brokerage in Anchorage (the Territory of Alaska not requiring a license) and saved enough so as not to have to work the railroad again. The firm was named the M. R. Gravel Real Estate Company. Gravel joined the Anchorage Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, and continued a sporadic relationship with the movement throughout his life.

Seeing Alaska as a wide-open place with no political establishment or entrenched interests, Gravel quickly became part of the civic scene there. By October 1957, he was a Division Chairman for Anchorage for the Democratic Central Committee in the territory, and by June 1958, he was president of the Alaska Young Democrats organization. He also became active in the United States Junior Chamber (Jaycees), and by early 1958, his duties included handing out awards for farmer of the year.

By early 1958, Gravel was running as Democratic Party primary candidate for a Third Division seat in House of Representatives of the territorial legislature. (This was one of the four administrative divisions into which Alaska was sectioned at the time.) Under the slogan &quot;Gravel, the Roadbed to Prosperity&quot;, he lost. At the same time, he was also an advocate for Alaskan statehood.

Gravel went on a 44-state national speaking tour concerning tax reform in 1959, sponsored by the Jaycees, often dressing for events as Paul Revere. Gravel was selected from some two thousand applications for this position. The tour received a good amount of local newspaper coverage at its various stops, with Gravel&#x27;s first name sometimes given as Mike and other times as Maurice. The tour&#x27;s general message was an urging of &quot;lower taxes, more efficiency in government and a system of taxation moderate at all levels of income&quot;. At several stops Gravel stated that the &quot;tide of socialism&quot; had to be stopped. He elaborated at another stop, &quot;It is part of our Jaycee creed that economic justice can best be won by free men through free enterprise. We really want to see that free enterprise become our inheritance.&quot; The tour was scheduled to conclude in Washington D.C., on Tax Day, April 15, with petition signatures accumulated for reform to be presented to U.S. lawmakers: dressed as Revere, Gravel rode with the petition to the steps of the U.S. Capitol.

The tour over, Gravel married Rita Jeannette Martin at the First Methodist Church of Anchorage on April 29, 1959. She was a native of Montana who had attended Billings Business College before moving to Alaska two years prior and becoming a secretary in the office of the Anchorage city manager. She had also been named Anchorage&#x27;s &quot;Miss Fur Rendezvous&quot; of 1958. They had two children, Martin Anthony Gravel and Lynne Denise Gravel, born and 1962 respectively.

Gravel ran without avail for the City Council in Anchorage in 1960. During this time, he had become a successful real estate agent; after the 1960 election, he became a property developer in a mobile home park on the outskirts of Anchorage. After a partner ran into financial difficulty, however, the project went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and Gravel was forced out in 1962.

==State legislator==

With the support of Alaska wholesale grocer Barney Gottstein and supermarket builder Larry Carr, Gravel ran for the Alaska House of Representatives representing Anchorage in 1962, initially assigned the 10th and then 8th districts. Alaska had very crowded primaries that year: Gravel was one of 33 Democrats, along with 21 Republicans, who were running for the chance to compete for the 14 House seats allocated to the 8th district. Gravel made it through the primary, and in November eight Republicans and six Democrats were elected to the House from the district, with Gravel finishing eighth overall and third among with Democrats, with 8,174 votes. Gottstein became Gravel&#x27;s main financial backer during most of his subsequent campaigns.

Gravel served in the Alaska House of Representatives from January 28, 1963, to January 22, 1967, winning reelection in 1964. In his first term, he served as a minority member on two House committees: Commerce, and Labor and Management. He co-authored and sponsored the act that created the Alaska State Commission for Human Rights. Gravel was the chief architect of the law that created a regional high school system for rural Alaska; this allowed Alaska Natives to attend schools near where they lived instead of having to go to schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the lower 48 states.

During the half-years that the legislature was not in session, Gravel resumed his real estate work. With Gottstein and Carr&#x27;s backing, he became quite successful as a property developer on the Kenai Peninsula.

During 1965 and 1966, he served as the Speaker of the House, surprising observers by winning that post. Gravel convinced former Speaker Warren A. Taylor to not try for the position against him by promising Taylor chairmanship of the Rules Committee, then reneged on the promise. Gravel denied later press charges that he had promised but not delivered on other committee chairmanships. As Speaker he antagonized fellow lawmakers by imposing his will on the legislature&#x27;s committees and feuded with Alaska State Senate president Robert J. McNealy.

Gravel did not run for reelection in 1966, instead choosing to run for Alaska&#x27;s seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, losing the primary to four-term incumbent Democrat Ralph Rivers by 1,300 votes and splitting the Democratic Party in the process. Rivers lost the general election that year to Republican state Senator Howard Pollock. Following this defeat, Gravel returned to the real estate business in Anchorage.

==U.S. Senator==

===Election to Senate in 1968===
In 1968, Gravel ran against 81-year-old incumbent Democratic United States Senator Ernest Gruening, a popular former governor of the Alaska Territory who was considered one of the fathers of Alaska&#x27;s statehood, for his party&#x27;s nomination to the U.S. Senate. Gravel&#x27;s campaign was primarily based on his youth and telegenic appearance rather than issue differences. He hired Joseph Napolitan, the first self-described political consultant, in late 1966. They spent over a year and a half planning a short, nine-day primary election campaign that featured the slogans &quot;Alaska first&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s do something about the state we&#x27;re in&quot;, the distribution of a collection of essays titled &quot;Jobs and More Jobs&quot;, and the creation of a half-hour, well-produced, glamorized biographical film of Gravel, &quot;A Man for Alaska&quot;. The film was shown twice a day on every television station in Alaska, and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of Alaska Native villages. The heavy showings quickly reversed a 2–to–1 Gruening lead in polls into a Gravel lead. Gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries.

Gravel also benefited from maintaining a deliberately ambiguous posture about Vietnam policy. Gruening had been one of only two senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and his opposition to President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s war policies was harming him among the Democratic electorate; according to Gravel, &quot;all I had to do was stand up and not deal with the subject, and people would assume that I was to the right of Ernest Gruening, when in point of fact I was to the left of him&quot;. In &quot;A Man for Alaska&quot;, Gravel argued that &quot;the liberals&quot; would come to West Germany&#x27;s defense if it was attacked, and that they &quot;should apply the same rule to Asians&quot;. During the campaign he also claimed that he was &quot;more in the mainstream of American thought on Vietnam&quot; than Gruening, despite the fact that he had written to Gruening to praise his antiwar stance four years earlier. Decades later, Gravel conceded that &quot;I said what I said [about Vietnam] to advance my career.&quot;

Gravel beat Gruening in the primary by about 2,000 votes. Gruening found &quot;the unexpected defeat hard to take&quot; and thought that some aspects of his opponent&#x27;s biographical film had misled viewers. In the general election, Gravel faced Republican Elmer E. Rasmuson, a banker and former mayor of Anchorage. College students in the state implored Gruening to run a write-in campaign as an Independent, but legal battles prevented him from getting approval for it until only two weeks were left. A late appearance by anti-war presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy did not offset Gruening&#x27;s lack of funds and endorsements; meanwhile, Gravel and Rasmuson both saturated local media with their filmed biographies. On November 5, 1968, Gravel won the general election with 45 percent of the vote to Rasmuson&#x27;s 37 percent and Gruening&#x27;s 18 percent.

===Senate assignments and style===
When Gravel joined the U.S. Senate in January 1969, he requested and received a seat on the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, which had direct relevance to Alaskan issues. He also got a spot on the Public Works Committee, which he held throughout his time in the Senate. Finally, he was a member of the Select Committee on Small Business. In 1971, he became chair of the Public Works Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds, and by 1973 he was chair of its Subcommittee on Water Resources, then later its Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution. Gravel was also initially named to the Joint Committee on Congressional Operations. By 1973, Gravel was off the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and the Select Small Business Committee and instead a member of the Finance Committee, and by 1977, he was chair of that body&#x27;s Subcommittee on Energy and Foundations. By 1973 he had also been on the ad hoc Special Committee to Study Secret and Confidential Government Documents.

By his own admission, Gravel was too new and &quot;too abrasive&quot; to be effective in the Senate by the usual means of seniority-based committee assignments or negotiating deals with other senators, and was sometimes seen as arrogant or a nuisance by the more senior and tradition-oriented members. Gravel relied on attention-getting gestures to achieve what he wanted, hoping national exposure would force other senators to listen to him. But even senators who agreed with him on issues considered his methods to be showboating.

As part of this approach, Gravel voted with Southern Democrats to keep the Senate filibuster rule in place, and accordingly supported Russell Long and Robert Byrd but opposed Ted Kennedy in Senate leadership battles. In retrospective assessment, University of Alaska Anchorage history professor Stephen Haycox said, &quot;Loose cannon is a good description of Gravel&#x27;s Senate career. He was an off-the-wall guy, and you weren&#x27;t really ever sure what he would do.&quot;

===Nuclear issues and the Cold War===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. Department of Defense was in the process of performing tests for the nuclear warhead for the Spartan anti-ballistic missile. Two tests, the &quot;Milrow&quot; and &quot;Cannikin&quot; tests, were planned, involving the detonation of nuclear bombs under Amchitka Island in Alaska. The Milrow test would be a one-megaton calibration exercise for the second and larger five-megaton Cannikin test, which would measure the effectiveness of the warhead. Gravel opposed the tests. Before the Milrow test took place in October 1969, he wrote that there were significant risks of earthquakes and other adverse consequences and called for an independent national commission on nuclear and seismic safety; he then made a personal appeal to President Richard Nixon to stop the test.

After Milrow was conducted, there was continued pressure on the part of environmental groups against going forward with the Cannikin test, while the Federation of American Scientists claimed that the warhead being tested was already obsolete. In May 1971, Gravel sent a letter to U.S. Atomic Energy Commission hearings held in Anchorage in which he said the risk of the test was not worth taking. Eventually a group not involving Gravel took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to issue an injunction against it, and the Cannikin test took place as scheduled in November 1971. Gravel had failed to stop the tests (notwithstanding his later claims during his 2008 presidential campaign).

In 1971, Gravel voted against the Nixon administration&#x27;s proposed anti-ballistic missile system, the Safeguard Program, having previously vacillated over the issue, suggesting that he might be willing to support it in exchange for federal lands in Alaska being opened up for private oil drilling. His vote alienated Senator Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, who had raised funds for Gravel&#x27;s primary campaign.

Nuclear power was considered an environmentally clean alternative for commercial generation of electricity and was part of a popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the 1950s and 1960s. Gravel publicly opposed this policy; besides the dangers of nuclear testing, he was a vocal critic of the Atomic Energy Commission, which oversaw American nuclear efforts, and of the powerful United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which Gravel tried to circumvent. In 1971, Gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents; in 1975, he was still proposing similar moratoriums. By 1974, Gravel was allied with Ralph Nader&#x27;s organization in opposing nuclear power.

Six months before U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger&#x27;s July 1971 secret mission to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (P.R.C.), Gravel introduced legislation to recognize and normalize relations with the P.R.C., including a proposal for unity talks between the P.R.C. and the Republic of China (Taiwan) regarding the Chinese seat on the U.N. Security Council. He reiterated his position in favor of recognition, with four other senators in agreement, during Senate hearings in June 1971.

===Vietnam War, the draft, and the Pentagon Papers===
Although he did not campaign against the Vietnam War during his first Senate campaign, by the end of 1970, Gravel was speaking out against United States policy in southeast Asia: in December of that year he persuaded William Fulbright to join him in a spontaneous two-day filibuster against a $155 million military aid package to Cambodia&#x27;s Khmer Republic government in the Cambodian Civil War.

President Richard Nixon had campaigned in 1968 on a promise to end the U.S. military draft, a decision endorsed by the February 1970 report of the Gates Commission.
The existing draft law was scheduled to conclude at the end of June 1971, and the Senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the Vietnam War continued. The Nixon administration announced in February 1971 that it wanted a two-year extension to June 1973, after which the draft would end; Army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a two-year extension, after which an all-volunteer force would be in place. Skeptics such as Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John Stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a four-year extension, but the two-year proposal is what went forward in Congress. By early May 1971, Gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation, halting conscription and thereby bringing U.S. involvement in the war to a rapid end. During this period he also supported efforts to mobilize and influence public opinion against the war, endorsing the &quot;Vietnam War Out Now&quot; rallies in Washington D.C. and San Francisco on April 24, 1971, and financing a broadcast campaign by the antiwar group War No More with a personal loan. In June 1972, he escorted a group of over 100 antiwar protesters, including psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, actress Candice Bergen, theater producer and director Joseph Papp, and pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Spock, into the United States Capitol Building; the group was arrested after blocking a hallway outside the Senate chamber.

By June 1971, some Democratic senators opposed to the war wanted to limit the renewal to a one-year extension, while others wanted to end it immediately; Gravel reiterated that he was one of the latter, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a senseless war, and one way to do away with it is to do away with the draft.&quot; A Senate vote on June 4 indicated majority support for the two-year extension. On June 18 Gravel announced again his intention to counteract that by filibustering the renewal legislation, defending the practice against those who associated it only with blocking civil rights legislation. The first filibuster attempt failed on June 23 when, by three votes, the Senate voted cloture for only the fifth time since 1927.

Protracted negotiations took place over House conference negotiations on the bill, revolving in large part around Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield&#x27;s eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from Vietnam; during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted. On August 5, the Nixon administration pleaded for a renewal before the Senate went on recess, but Gravel blocked Stennis&#x27;s attempt to limit debate, and no vote was held. Finally on September 21, 1971, the Senate invoked cloture over Gravel&#x27;s second filibuster attempt by one vote, and then passed the two-year draft extension. Gravel&#x27;s attempts to stop the draft had failed (notwithstanding Gravel&#x27;s later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft, taken at face value in some media reports, during his 2008 presidential campaign).

Meanwhile, on June 13, 1971, &quot;The New York Times&quot; began printing large portions of the Pentagon Papers. The papers were a large collection of secret government documents and studies pertaining to the Vietnam War, of which former Defense Department analyst Daniel Ellsberg had made unauthorized copies and was determined to make public. Ellsberg had for a year and a half approached members of Congress – such as William Fulbright, George McGovern, Charles Mathias, and Pete McCloskey – about publishing the documents, on the grounds that the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution would give congressional members immunity from prosecution, but all had refused. Instead, Ellsberg allowed &quot;Times&quot; reporter Neil Sheehan to take notes of the Papers, but Sheehan disobeyed, copying them and taking the copies by plane to Washington, then New York, for organization and publication.

The U.S. Justice Department immediately tried to halt publication, on the grounds that the information revealed within the papers harmed the national interest. Within the next two weeks, a federal court injunction halted publication in the &quot;Times&quot;; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and several other newspapers began publishing parts of the documents, with some of them also being halted by injunctions; and the whole matter went to the U.S. Supreme Court for arguments. Looking for an alternate publication mechanism, Ellsberg returned to his idea of having a member of Congress read them, and chose Gravel based on the latter&#x27;s efforts against the draft; Gravel agreed where previously others had not. Ellsberg arranged for the papers to be given to Gravel on June 26 via an intermediary, &quot;Post&quot; editor Ben Bagdikian. Gravel used his counter-intelligence experience to choose a midnight transfer in front of the Mayflower Hotel in the center of Washington, D.C.

Over the next several days, Gravel (who was dyslexic) was assisted by his congressional office staff in reading and analyzing the report. Worried his home might be raided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Gravel smuggled the report (which filled two large suitcases) into his congressional office, which was then guarded by disabled Vietnam veterans.

On the night of June 29, 1971, Gravel attempted to read the papers on the floor of the Senate as part of his filibuster against the draft, but was thwarted when no quorum could be formed. Gravel instead convened a session of the Buildings and Grounds subcommittee that he chaired. He got New York Congressman John G. Dow to testify that the war had soaked up funding for public buildings, thus making discussion of the war relevant to the committee. He began reading from the papers with the press in attendance, omitting supporting documents that he felt might compromise national security, and declaring, &quot;It is my constitutional obligation to protect the security of the people by fostering the free flow of information absolutely essential to their democratic decision-making.&quot;

He read until 1 a.m., culminating by saying &quot;Arms are being severed. Metal is clashing through human bodies because of the public policy this government and all its branches continue to support.&quot; Then with tears and sobs he said that he could no longer physically continue, the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll. Gravel ended the session by, with no other senators present, establishing unanimous consent to insert 4,100 pages of the Papers into the Congressional Record of his subcommittee. The following day, the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;New York Times Co. v. United States&quot; decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in the &quot;Times&quot; and others resumed. In July 1971, Bantam Books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material the &quot;Times&quot; had published.

Gravel, too, wanted to privately publish the portion of the papers he had read into the record, believing that &quot;immediate disclosure of the contents of these papers will change the policy that supports the war&quot;. After being turned down by many commercial publishers, on August 4, he reached agreement with Beacon Press, the publishing arm of the Unitarian Universalist Association, of which Gravel was a member. Announced on August 17 and published on October 22, 1971, this four-volume, relatively expensive set became the &quot;Senator Gravel Edition&quot;, which studies from Cornell University and the Annenberg Center for Communication have labeled as the most complete edition of the Pentagon Papers to be published. The &quot;Gravel Edition&quot; was edited and annotated by Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn, and included an additional volume of analytical articles on the origins and progress of the war, also edited by Chomsky and Zinn. Beacon Press then was subjected to an FBI investigation; an outgrowth of this was the &quot;Gravel v. United States&quot; court case, which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled upon in June 1972; in a 5-to-4 decision it held that the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution did grant immunity to Gravel for his reading the papers in his subcommittee; did grant some immunity to Gravel&#x27;s congressional aide, but compelled the aide to testify before a grand jury about matters not directly related to the legislative process; and granted no immunity to Beacon Press in relation to their publishing the same papers.

The events of 1971 changed Gravel in the following months from an obscure freshman senator to a nationally visible political figure. He became a sought-after speaker on the college circuit as well as at political fundraisers, opportunities he welcomed as lectures were &quot;the one honest way a Senator has to supplement his income&quot;. The Democratic candidates for the 1972 presidential election sought his endorsement. In January 1972, Gravel endorsed Maine Senator Ed Muskie, hoping that his support would help Muskie with the party&#x27;s left wing and in ethnic French-Canadian areas during the first primary contest in New Hampshire (Muskie won, but not overwhelmingly, and his campaign faltered soon after). In April 1972, Gravel appeared on all three networks&#x27; nightly newscasts to decry the Nixon administration&#x27;s reliance on Vietnamization by making reference to the secret National Security Study Memorandum 1 document, which stated it would take 8–13 years for the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to defend South Vietnam. Gravel made excerpts from the study public, but senators Robert P. Griffin and William B. Saxbe blocked his attempt to read NSSM 1 into the Congressional Record.

=== Domestic policy ===
In 1970, Gravel co-sponsored legislation to establish a guaranteed minimum income, entitling poor families to up to $6,300 a year (the equivalent of $42,000 in 2019 after adjustment for inflation). He subsequently voted for a &quot;work bonus&quot; program, which would have entitled low-income working families with dependent children if they were paying Social Security or Railroad Retirement taxes to a non-taxable bonus of up to 10 percent of their wages.

In 1969, Gravel was the only Democratic Senator outside of the South to vote for Nixon&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee Clement Haynsworth. The following year, Gravel opposed Nixon&#x27;s next pick, G. Harrold Carswell.

===Run for vice president in 1972===
Gravel actively campaigned for the office of Vice President of the United States during the 1972 presidential election, announcing on June 2, 1972, over a month before the 1972 Democratic National Convention began, that he was interested in the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates. Toward this end he began soliciting delegates for their support. He was not alone in this effort, as former Governor of Massachusetts Endicott Peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year. Likely presidential nominee George McGovern was in fact already considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vice-presidential candidates and letting the delegates choose.

On the convention&#x27;s final day, July 14, 1972, McGovern selected and announced Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri as his vice-presidential choice. Eagleton was unknown to many delegates and the choice seemed to smack of traditional ticket balancing considerations. Thus there were delegates willing to look elsewhere. Gravel was nominated by Bettye Fahrenkamp, the Democratic National Committeewoman from Alaska. He then seconded his own nomination, breaking down in tears at his own words and maybe trying to withdraw his nomination. In any case he won 226 delegate votes, coming in third behind Eagleton and Frances &quot;Sissy&quot; Farenthold of Texas, in chaotic balloting that included several other candidates.

Gravel attracted some attention for his efforts: writer Norman Mailer said he &quot;provided considerable excitement&quot; and was &quot;good-looking enough to have played leads in B-films&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; correspondent Hunter S. Thompson said Gravel &quot;probably said a few things that might have been worth hearing, under different circumstances&quot;. Yet the process was doubly disastrous for the Democrats. In the time consumed by nominating and seconding and all the vice-presidential candidates&#x27; speeches, the attention of the delegates on the floor was lost and McGovern&#x27;s speech was pushed to 3:30 a.m. The haste with which Eagleton was selected led to surprise when his past mental health treatments were revealed; he withdrew from the ticket soon after the convention, to be replaced by Sargent Shriver.

===Reelection to Senate in 1974===
Several years earlier, Alaska politicians had speculated that Gravel would have a hard time getting both renominated and elected when his first term expired, given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and tended to focus on national rather than local issues.

Nonetheless, Gravel was reelected to the Senate in 1974, with 58 percent of the vote. His Republican opponent, State Senator C. R. Lewis, was a national officer of the John Birch Society, and earned 42 percent of the vote.

===Second term===
In 1975, Gravel introduced an amendment to cut the number of troops overseas by 200,000, but it was defeated on a voice vote.

In September 1975, Gravel was named as one of several Congressional Advisers to the Seventh Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which met to discuss problems related to economic development and international economic cooperation.

In June 1976, Gravel was the focus of a federal investigation into allegations that he was involved in a sex-for-vote arrangement. Congressional staff clerk Elizabeth Ray (who had already been involved in a sex scandal that led to the downfall of Representative Wayne Hays) said that in August 1972 she had sex with Gravel aboard a houseboat on the Potomac River, under the instruction of Representative Kenneth J. Gray, her boss at the time. Gray allegedly wanted to secure Gravel&#x27;s support for further funding for construction of the National Visitor Center in Washington, a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired. Another Congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter, but Gravel said at the time that he had never met either of the women. Gravel and Gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation, and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing. Decades later, Gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with Ray, but had not changed any votes because of it.

Gravel and his main financial backer, Gottstein, had a falling out in 1978, during the Congressional debate over whether to allow a controversial sale of U.S. F-15 fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia. An ardent backer of Israel, Gottstein opposed the sale and asked Gravel to vote against it. But Gravel not only voted for it but made an emotional speech attacking the anti-sale campaign. Gravel wrote in 2008 that it was the only time Gottstein had ever asked him for a favor, and the rupture resulted in their never speaking to each other again.

===Alaskan issues===

By 1971, Gravel was urging construction of the much-argued Trans-Alaska pipeline, addressing environmental concerns by saying that the pipeline&#x27;s builders and operators should have &quot;total and absolute&quot; responsibility for any consequent environmental damage. Two years later, the debate over the pipeline came to a crux, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; describing it as &quot;environmentalists [in] a holy war with the major oil companies&quot;. In February 1973, the U.S. Court of Appeals blocked the issuance of permits for construction; Gravel and fellow Alaskan Senator Ted Stevens reacted by urging Congress to pass legislation overturning the court&#x27;s decision. Environmentalists opposed to the pipeline, such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Sierra Club then sought to use the recently passed National Environmental Policy Act to their advantage; Gravel designed an amendment to the pipeline bill that would immunize the pipeline from any further court challenges under that law, and thus speed its construction. Passage of the amendment became the key battle regarding the pipeline. On July 17, 1973, in what the &quot;New York Times&quot; termed a &quot;nip-and-tuck roll-call&quot;, the Gravel amendment was approved, as a 49–49 tie was broken in favor by Vice President Spiro Agnew. The actual bill enabling the pipeline then passed easily; Gravel had triumphed in what became perhaps his most lasting accomplishment as a senator.

In opposition to the Alaskan fishing industry, Gravel advocated American participation in the formation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. For two years he opposed legislation that established a Exclusive Economic Zone for marine resources. He was one of only 19 senators to vote against Senate approval for the expanded zone in 1976, saying it would undermine the U.S. position in Law of the Sea negotiations and that nations arbitrarily extending their fishing rights limits would &quot;produce anarchy of the seas&quot;. The legislation was passed, and the United States has signed but never ratified the Law of the Sea treaty.

Gravel accumulated a complicated record on Indian affairs during his time in the Senate. During his first year in the Senate Gravel urged abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, criticizing the agency for the pace of development of schools in Alaska, its paternalistic attitudes and the culturally inappropriate nature of its education, and advocating greater shared decision-making between the federal government and native communities in Alaska. Later, his views changed; in the early 1970s Gravel supported a demonstration project that established links between Alaskan villages and the National Institute of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, for medical diagnostic communications. Gravel helped secure a private grant to facilitate the first Inuit Circumpolar Conference in 1977, attended by Inuit representatives from Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. These conferences now also include representatives from Russia. In 1977, Gravel helped lead an effort to have the U.S. Interior Department rename Mount McKinley to Denali; this eventually led to Denali National Park being so named. Subsequently, Gravel proposed a never-built &quot;Denali City&quot; development above the Tokositna River near the mountain, to consist of a giant Teflon dome enclosing hotels, golf courses, condominiums, and commercial buildings. A related idea of his to build a high-speed rail line to Denali also failed to gain traction.

A key, emotional issue in the state at the time was &quot;locking up Alaska&quot;, making reference to allocation of its vast, mostly uninhabited land. President Jimmy Carter desired to put large portions of this land under federal protection against development, a move that some Alaskans vociferously opposed.
In 1978 Gravel blocked passage, via procedural delays such as walking out of House–Senate conference committee meetings, of a complex bill which represented a compromise on land use policy. The bill would have put some of Alaska&#x27;s vast federal land holdings under state control while preserving other portions for federal parks and refuges; the blocking action earned Gravel the enmity of fellow Alaska Senator Ted Stevens, who had supported the compromise. In 1980, a new lands bill came up for consideration, that was less favorable to Alaskan interests and more liked by environmentalists; it set aside of Alaska&#x27;s for national parks, conservation areas, and other restricted federal uses. Gravel blocked it, as not ensuring enough future development in the state. A new compromise version of the 1980 bill came forward, which reduced the land set aside to . Representing Alaskan interests, Gravel tried to stop the bill, including by filibuster. But the Senate voted for cloture and passed the bill. Frustrated, Gravel said, &quot;the legislation denies Alaska its rights as a state, and denies the U.S. crucial strategic resources,&quot; and opined that the Senate was &quot;a little bit like a tank of barracudas&quot;. Nonetheless, the bill, known as the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, was signed by President Carter shortly before leaving the White House, and led to millions of acres being set aside in the state for national parks, wildlife refuges, and other kinds of areas under protection.

In 1978 Gravel authored and secured the passage into federal law of the General Stock Ownership Corporation, that became Subchapter U of the Tax Code under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. This gave states the ability to create corporations that would invest in for-profit enterprises, with all citizens within the state owning shares in the corporation. Gravel&#x27;s attempt to convince the Alaska state legislature to create such a corporation failed, as did a 1980 state ballot initiative towards the same end, but nevertheless the creation of the General Stock Ownership Corporation in federal law turned out to be significant in the development of binary economics.

===Loss of Senate seat in 1980===
In 1980, Gravel was challenged for the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination by State Representative Clark Gruening, the grandson of the man Gravel had defeated in a primary 12 years earlier. One of Gruening&#x27;s supporters was Gravel&#x27;s former backer Gottstein. Several factors made Gravel vulnerable. As an insurgent candidate in 1968, Gravel had never established a firm party base. Not liking to hunt or fish, he was also always culturally suspect in the state.

The primary campaign was bitterly fought. A group of Democrats, including future governor Steve Cowper, led the campaign against Gravel, with Gravel&#x27;s actions in respect to the 1978 and 1980 Alaskan lands bills a major issue. This was especially so given that the 1980 bill&#x27;s dénouement happened but a week before the primary. The sources of Gravel&#x27;s campaign funds, some of which Gravel readily acknowledged came from political action committees outside the state, also became an issue in the contest. Gruening had pledged that he would not take special interest group money, but Gravel said that Gruening was &quot;dishonest&quot; in accepting individual contributors from Jewish donors living outside the state because to him such contributors comprised &quot;a special interest group ... that seeks to influence the foreign policy of the U.S.&quot;

Gruening decisively won the primary with about 55 percent of the vote to Gravel&#x27;s 44 percent. Gravel later conceded that by the time of his defeat, he had alienated &quot;almost every constituency in Alaska&quot;. Another factor may have been Alaska&#x27;s blanket primary system of the time, which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents; Republicans believed Gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election.

Gruening lost the general election to Republican banker Frank Murkowski. Gravel was the last Democrat to represent Alaska in Congress for 28 years.

==Career after leaving the Senate==

Of his 1980 defeat, Gravel later recalled: &quot;I had lost my career. I lost my marriage. I was in the doldrums for ten years after my defeat,&quot; and &quot;Nobody wanted to hire me for anything important. I felt like I was worthless. I didn&#x27;t know what I could do.&quot; By his own later description, Gravel was a womanizer, and had an affair while in the Senate, and he and his wife Rita separated in December 1980. They filed for divorce in September 1981; she later received all of his Senate pension income.

During the 1980s, Gravel was a real estate developer in Anchorage and Kenai, Alaska, a consultant, and a stockbroker. One of his real estate ventures, a condominium business, was forced to declare bankruptcy and a lawsuit ensued. In 1986, Gravel worked in partnership with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to buy losses that financially troubled Alaska Native Corporations could not take as tax deductions and sell them to large national companies looking for tax write-offs. Gravel also learned computer programming at some point but never practiced it.

In 1984, Gravel married his second wife, Whitney Stewart Gravel, who had been an administrative assistant for U.S. Senator from New York Jacob Javits.

===Return to politics===

In 1989, Gravel reentered politics. He founded and led The Democracy Foundation, which promotes direct democracy. He established the Philadelphia II corporation, which seeks to replicate the original 1787 Constitutional Convention and have a Second Constitutional Convention to bring about direct democracy Gravel led an effort to get a United States Constitutional amendment to allow voter-initiated federal legislation similar to state ballot initiatives. He argued that Americans are able to legislate responsibly, and that the Act and Amendment in the National Initiative would allow American citizens to become &quot;law makers&quot;. However such efforts met with little success.

In 2001, Gravel became director of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, where he admired institute co-founder Gregory Fossedal&#x27;s work on direct democracy in Switzerland. By 2004, Gravel had become chair of the institute, and Fossedal (who in turn was a director of the Democracy Foundation) gave the introduction at Gravel&#x27;s presidential announcement.

In 2003, Gravel gave a speech on direct democracy at a conference hosted by the &quot;American Free Press&quot;. The event was cosponsored by &quot;The Barnes Review&quot;, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. After some controversy over his appearance, Gravel apologized, saying he did not realize the group&#x27;s ties. Gravel said repeatedly that he did not share the group&#x27;s views on the Holocaust, stating, &quot;You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. [&quot;The&quot; &quot;Barnes Review&quot; publishers] are nutty as loons if they don&#x27;t think it happened&quot;. The group invited Gravel to speak again, but he declined.

Mike and Whitney Gravel lived in Arlington County, Virginia, until 2010, and then resided in Burlingame, California. They have the two grown children from his first marriage, Martin Gravel and Lynne Gravel Mosier, and four grandchildren. Whitney Gravel&#x27;s income sustained the couple from 1998 on. In the 2000s, Gravel had poor health, requiring three surgeries in 2003 for back pain and neuropathy. Due to unreimbursed medical expenses and debts from his political causes, he declared personal bankruptcy in 2004. He began taking a salary from the non-profit organizations for which he was working; much of that income was lent to his presidential campaign. In 2007, he declared that he had &quot;zero net worth&quot;.

==2008 presidential campaign==
===Democratic Party primaries===

At the start of 2006, Gravel decided the best way he could promote direct democracy and the National Initiative was to run for president. On April 17, 2006, Gravel became the first candidate for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in the 2008 election, announcing his run in a speech to the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Short on campaign cash, he took public transportation to get to his announcement. (Gravel called for public financing of elections.) Other principal Gravel positions were the FairTax, as well as withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq within 120 days and a single payer national health care system.

Gravel had opposed the Iraq War, and President George W. Bush&#x27;s rationale for it, from the beginning, and in 2006 said that U.S. troops in Iraq, as in Vietnam, had &quot;died in vain&quot;. He also favored a regional peace initiative, as well as reparation payments for Iraqis. Gravel also called for a &quot;U.S. corporate withdrawal from Iraq&quot;, with reconstruction contracts held by U.S. companies to be turned over to Iraqi firms.

Gravel campaigned almost full-time in New Hampshire, the first primary state, following his announcement. Opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination showed Gravel with 1 percent or less support. By the end of March 2007, Gravel&#x27;s campaign had less than $500 in cash on hand against debts of nearly $90,000.
Because of his time in the Senate, Gravel was invited to many of the early Democratic presidential debates. During the initial one at South Carolina State University on April 26, 2007, he suggested a bill requiring the president to withdraw from Iraq on pain of criminal penalties. He also advocated positions such as opposing preemptive nuclear war. He stated that the Iraq War had the effect of creating more terrorists and that the &quot;war was lost the day that George Bush invaded Iraq on a fraudulent basis&quot;. Regarding his fellow candidates, he said, &quot;I got to tell you, after standing up with them, some of these people frighten me – they frighten me.&quot; In one such exchange, Gravel said, &quot;Tell me, Barack, who do you want to nuke?&quot; to which Obama responded, &quot;I&#x27;m not planning to nuke anybody right now, Mike, I promise.&quot;

Media stories said that Gravel was responsible for much of whatever &quot;heat&quot; and &quot;flashpoints&quot; had taken place during the Democratic debates. Gravel gained considerable publicity by shaking up the normally staid multiple-candidate format; &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; media critic said that what Gravel had done was &quot;steal a debate with outrageous, curmudgeonly statements&quot;. The Internet was a benefit: a YouTube video of his responses in the debate was viewed more than 225,892 times, ranking seventeenth in most views for week and first among news and politics clips; his name became the fifteenth most searched-for in the blogosphere; and his website garnered more traffic than those of frontrunners Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, or John Edwards. Gravel appeared on the popular &quot;Colbert Report&quot; on television on May 2, and his campaign and career were profiled in national publications such as &quot;Salon&quot;. Two wordless, Warholesque campaign videos, &quot;Rock&quot; and &quot;Fire&quot;, were released on YouTube in late May and became hits, and eventually gained over 760,000 and 185,000 views respectively. &quot;Rock&quot;, in turn, was given airtime during an episode of &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;. Some thirty-five years after he first achieved the national spotlight, he had found it again.
All this did not improve his performance in the polls; a May 2007 CNN poll showed him with less than 0.5 percent support among Democrats. Gravel was in the next several debates, in one case after CNN reversed a decision to exclude him. Like some of the other second-tier candidates, Gravel did not get as much time as the leaders; during the June 2, 2007, New Hampshire debate, which lasted two hours, he was asked 10 questions and allowed to speak for five minutes and 37 seconds.

During the July 23, 2007, CNN-YouTube presidential debate, Gravel responded to audience applause when he had complained of a lack of airtime and said: &quot;Thank you. Has it been fair thus far?&quot; Detractors began to liken him to &quot;the cranky uncle who lives in the attic,&quot; or &quot;the angry old guy that just seemed to want to become angrier&quot;. Berkeley political scientist David Terr found that moderator George Stephanopoulos directed roughly five percent of his questions to Gravel; in a poll asking who did the best in the debate, Gravel placed seventh among the eight candidates. National opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination continued to show Gravel with one percent or zero percent numbers. By the end of the third-quarter 2007, Gravel had about $17,500 in cash on hand, had collected a total of about $380,000 during the 2008 election cycle, and was continuing to run a threadbare campaign with minimal staff.
Beginning with the October 30, 2007, Philadelphia event, Gravel was excluded from most of the debates, with the debate sponsors or the Democratic National Committee saying Gravel&#x27;s campaign had not met fund-raising, polling, or local campaign organizational thresholds. For the Philadelphia exclusion, Gravel blamed corporate censorship on the part of sponsor owner and alleged military-industrial complex member General Electric for his exclusion and mounted a counter-gathering and debate against a video screen a short distance away, but he had lost his easiest publicity. In reaction, supporters organized &quot;mass donation days&quot; to try to help the campaign gain momentum and funds, such as on December 5, 2007, the anniversary of the Repeal of Prohibition.

Gravel did not compete in the initial 2008 vote, the Iowa caucuses, but was still subjected to a false report from MSNBC that he had pulled out of the race afterward. Gravel did focus his attention on the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary. In early January, &quot;Mother Jones&#x27;&quot; investigative reporter James Ridgeway was filmed interviewing and following Gravel in New Hampshire, in which Gravel is interviewed on the phone by Neal Conan for NPR&#x27;s, &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;. He received about 400 votes out of some 280,000 cast in New Hampshire, or 0.14 percent, before taking time off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay in the presidential campaign until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader. By late March, Gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten Democratic primaries.

===Switch to Libertarian Party===

On March 25, 2008, Gravel announced that he would leave the Democrats and join the Libertarian Party, saying: &quot;My libertarian views, as well as my strong stance against war, the military industrial complex and American imperialism, seem not to be tolerated by Democratic Party elites who are out of touch with the average American; elites that reject the empowerment of American citizens I offered to the Democratic Party at the beginning of this presidential campaign with the National Initiative for Democracy.&quot; The following day Gravel entered the race for the 2008 Libertarian presidential nomination, saying that he would have run as a third-party candidate all along except that he needed the public exposure that came from being in the earlier Democratic debates. Gravel&#x27;s initial notion of running as a fusion candidate with other parties was met with skepticism.

As a Libertarian candidate, Gravel faced resistance to his past support of big government initiatives and his unorthodox positions around direct democracy. Nevertheless, he garnered more support than he had as a Democrat, placing second and third in two April 2008 straw polls. In the May 25 balloting at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention in Denver, Gravel finished fourth out of eight candidates on the initial ballot, with 71 votes out of a total 618; he trailed former Congressman and eventual winner Bob Barr, author Mary Ruwart, and businessman Wayne Allyn Root. Gravel&#x27;s position did not subsequently improve and he was eliminated on the fourth ballot. Afterwards he stated, &quot;I just ended my political career&quot;, but he vowed to continue promoting his positions as a writer and lecturer.

==2008–early 2019==

In June 2008, Gravel endorsed the NYC 9/11 Ballot Initiative, saying the measure would create a &quot;citizens commission rather than a government commission&quot; with subpoena power against top U.S. officials to &quot;make a true investigation as to what happened&quot; regarding the September 11 attacks. He later said, &quot;Individuals in and out of government may certainly have participated with the obviously known perpetrators of this dastardly act. Suspicions abound over the analysis presented by government. Obviously an act that has triggered three wars, Afghan, Iraqi and the continuing War on Terror, should be extensively investigated which was not done and which the government avoids addressing.&quot;

In August 2008, Gravel was speaking to a crowd of supporters of Sami Al-Arian (who two years earlier had pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison for a charge of conspiracy in helping Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a &quot;specially designated terrorist&quot; organization) when he was caught on tape saying of Al-Arian&#x27;s prosecutor, &quot;Find out where he lives, find out where his kids go to school, find out where his office is: picket him all the time. Call him a racist in signs if you see him. Call him an injustice. Call him whatever you want to call him, but in his face all the time.&quot; Gravel was criticized for potentially involving the children of the prosecutor, and Al-Arian&#x27;s family disavowed the sentiments.

Gravel defended Alaska Governor Sarah Palin after she was chosen as Republican presidential nominee John McCain&#x27;s running mate in September 2008. He praised Palin&#x27;s record in standing up to corruption among Alaskan Republicans, thought her national inexperience was an asset rather than a detriment, and predicted that the &quot;Troopergate&quot; investigation into whether she improperly fired a state official would &quot;come out in her favor&quot;. Gravel made clear he would not support or vote for either McCain–Palin or Obama–Biden in the general election. The following year Gravel said that Palin&#x27;s politics were &quot;terrible, but that doesn&#x27;t detract from the fact that she&#x27;s a very talented person&quot;. He predicted that Palin would run for president in 2012 and that &quot;she&#x27;s going to surprise a lot of people&quot;. Palin did not run, but Gravel&#x27;s prediction about &quot;TrooperGate&quot; was accurate as Palin was found not to have violated ethics laws.

In 2013, by the invitation of Hamed Ghashghavi, the secretary for international affairs of the 3rd International Conference on Hollywoodism in Tehran, Iran, Gravel attended that event as an Iranian government-organized anti-Hollywood conference. Gravel noted that the conference was attended by &quot;various elements of extremes&quot; but said it was necessary to discuss how the U.S. film industry portrayed Iran in order to prevent &quot;an insane war&quot; between the two nations.

In May 2013, Gravel was one of several former members of Congress to accept $20,000 from the Paradigm Research Group, an advocacy group for UFO disclosure, as part of holding what they termed a Citizen Hearing on Disclosure, modeled after congressional hearings, regarding supposed U.S. government suppression of evidence concerning UFOs. Gravel said, &quot;Something is monitoring the planet, and they are monitoring it very cautiously, because we are a very warlike planet,&quot; and, &quot;What we&#x27;re faced with here is, in areas of the media, and the government too, an effort to marginalize and ridicule people who have specific knowledge.&quot;

In December 2014, Gravel was announced as the new CEO of KUSH, a company which makes marijuana-infused products for medicinal and recreational use, and a subsidiary of Cannabis Sativa, Inc. He also became an Independent Director of Cannabis Sativa.

During the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, Gravel praised Bernie Sanders and his campaign, saying &quot;Bernie is one of the most gifted politicians I have ever observed. He&#x27;s a person of great integrity and very clever.&quot; Gravel predicted that Sanders would be elected president but would be unable to get his key reforms through Congress, and thus that Sanders and his supporters should back some of the proposals of the National Initiative.

In 2016, Gravel said in relation to the September 11 attacks: &quot;We killed 58,000 American servicemen in the Vietnam War and all they did was die in vain. What&#x27;s so unusual about killing 3,000 more in order to develop the grist for the mill to empower into infinity the military industrial complex?&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s no question in my mind that 9/11 was an inside job&quot;. The remarks were later disavowed by even Gravel supporters.

By 2019, Gravel was living in Seaside, California. He was working on a book, at the time titled &quot;Human Governance&quot;, about his principal idea for direct democracy, a U.S. Constitutional Amendment to create a &quot;Legislature of the People&quot; that would circumvent the existing Congress. The book was self-published at the end of the year by AuthorHouse under the title &quot;The Failure of Representative Government and the Solution: A Legislature of the People&quot;.

==2020 presidential campaign==

On March 19, 2019, Gravel announced that he was considering running in the 2020 Democratic primaries. He said, &quot;The goal will not be to win, but to bring a critique of American imperialism to the Democratic debate stage.&quot; An exploratory committee was formed, with filing a statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission on that same day. The filing was the idea of a group of teenagers, led by David Oks and Henry Williams, inspired by the podcast &quot;Chapo Trap House&quot;, and done with Gravel&#x27;s consent (after a week spent convincing him of the idea&#x27;s merits), but without his involvement. Intrigued by the group&#x27;s commitment to amplifying his long-held policy goals, Gravel (who would be old on Inauguration Day in 2021) said he planned to meet with them in April, and to discuss a 2020 White House run with his wife. On April 2, 2019, Gravel filed to officially run for office. The campaign called itself the &quot;#Gravelanche&quot;.

Gravel&#x27;s initial stated goal was merely to qualify for debates by getting the required 65,000 small donors. He discouraged people from voting for him and said his preferences were Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard, both of whom favor a non-interventionist foreign policy. But on April 29, Gravel&#x27;s campaign said he was running to win, not just to participate in debates. In a subsequent interview, though, Gravel emphasized the virtue of Sanders and Gabbard in some order as a presidential ticket. Statements like these caused Vox to call Gravel &quot;2020&#x27;s oddest Democratic presidential candidate&quot;. The &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; included Gravel as an example in the rise of democratic socialism in the United States also exemplified by Sanders&#x27;s 2016 race and the 2018 election of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: &quot;[Gravel&#x27;s] campaign represents the most absurd form of a legitimate movement on the left that feels little obligation to the Democratic Party.&quot;

In June 2019, Gravel touted the endorsement of Muntadher al-Zaidi, the Iraqi journalist who, in December 2008, made headlines after he threw his shoes at President George W. Bush in protest of the U.S. war in Iraq. Al-Zaidi endorsed Gravel based on his promise to improve White House policies regarding Iraq and the Middle East.

On June 13, 2019, the Democratic Party announced the 20 major candidates who qualified for the first debate later that month. Gravel was one of the four who missed out (the others were Montana Governor Steve Bullock, U.S. Representative Seth Moulton, and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam). Gravel had been unable to get the requisite number of donations, or to score one percent or better in enough polls (many polls did not even include him). Nevertheless, Gravel said he would not drop out and would try to qualify for the July debate. In early July, however, Gravel&#x27;s campaign said it was still 10,000 contributions short of the 65,000-donor threshold and that it was &quot;nearing its conclusion&quot;. It solicited suggestions for where to donate $100,000 to $150,000 of leftover campaign funds. Gravel added that he had always planned on ending the campaign before the teenagers in charge of it needed to return to school. A few days later, the campaign became the first to run an attack ad against Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, using the text &quot;Is this the best our party has to offer?&quot;

Gravel&#x27;s campaign crossed the threshold of 65,000 donors on July 12, 2019, meeting the qualification mark for that month&#x27;s debate. But because 20 other candidates, the maximum allowed to participate, had already met at least the polling criterion, which takes priority over the donor criterion, Gravel was not invited.

The campaign officially came to a close on August 6, 2019, with Gravel endorsing both Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard for president. Gravel&#x27;s campaign later stated on Twitter that they never wanted to win but saw the campaign as an &quot;intimately democratic&quot; project and expressed honor at working with Gravel. Gravel said he would divide remaining campaign funds between charity and a new think tank which would espouse his ideas.

== The Gravel Institute ==

Gravel used some of the funds remaining from his 2020 presidential campaign to found an eponymous progressive think tank called The Gravel Institute in 2019. As noted by &quot;Vice&quot; magazine, the Institute aimed to do battle with PragerU from a left-wing perspective. Launched in September 2020, the new entity said it would &quot;carry on the life&#x27;s work of former U.S Senator Mike Gravel in fighting for global peace and democracy. Its mission is to promote bold and forward-looking ideas about a more peaceful and egalitarian world, and to build a robust movement of young people to win it&quot;. Contributors to the Institute included Cornel West and Slavoj Žižek. The institute was largely centered around the creation of videos and a website. The last of the videos was put up in 2022; the website was shuttered in 2023 for lack of payment.

==Death==
Gravel died of multiple myeloma at his home in Seaside, California, on June 26, 2021, at age 91. As a result, on the delay in burials induced by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Gravel was later laid to rest on June 20, 2023, at Arlington National Cemetery where his cremated remains were buried. While given a military burial, a gun salute was not given at his request as he remained steadfast with his anti-violence stance.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″s obituary for Gravel characterized him as &quot;an unabashed attention-getter&quot; who later become known for &quot;mounting long-shot presidential runs&quot;. The obituary in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was similar, saying that Gravel was &quot;an Alaska Democrat with a flair for the theatrical who rose from obscurity to brief renown&quot; and later &quot;ran quixotic campaigns for the presidency&quot;. The &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; quoted Gravel as saying of himself in 1989, &quot;I&#x27;m an independent kind of guy. A rough and ready kind of guy. My glands work in a certain way that make me stand up, foolishly sometimes, and fight.&quot;

==Political positions==

Alan Abramowitz and Jeffrey Allan Segal described Gravel as &quot;a maverick, if not an eccentric, in the Senate.&quot; His Americans for Democratic Action &quot;Liberal Quotient&quot; scores ranged from 81 out of 100 (1971) to 39 out of 100 (1980), with an average of around 61. His American Conservative Union scores ranged from 0 out of 100 (several years, including 1971 and 1972) to 38 out of 100 (1979), with an average of 14. Abramowitz and Segal note that Gravel&#x27;s lowest ADA ratings coincided with his two Senate re-election bids, and for the most part his highest ACU ratings followed the same pattern.

In 1972, as a young senator, Gravel published &quot;Citizen Power: A People&#x27;s Platform&quot;, a manifesto outlining what &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; termed a &quot;populist reform [that] would provide &#x27;balanced political power&#x27; between the people and government and business interests.&quot;

===Civil rights issues===
On drug policy, Gravel said in 2007 that he favored decriminalization and treating addiction as a public health matter. During his 2008 presidential candidacy, he condemned the War on Drugs as a failure, saying that it did &quot;nothing but savage our inner cities and put our children at risk&quot;. Gravel called for abolition of capital punishment in his book &quot;Citizen Power&quot;, and adhered to this position during his 2008 run for president. He supported abortion rights.

During the 2008 campaign, Gravel was a strong supporter of LGBT rights. He supported same-sex marriage and opposed the Defense of Marriage Act and the U.S. military&#x27;s &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy. He wrote in 2008 that &quot;depriving gays and lesbians of equal rights is immoral&quot;.

===Foreign policy and defense issues===
Later in life, Gravel described himself as a critic of American imperialism.

Gravel firmly opposed U.S. military action against Iran and Syria. He voiced opposition to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, the use of torture, indefinite detention, and what he called &quot;flagrant ignorance&quot; of the Geneva Convention. In 2014, Gravel called for the release of the full, unredacted Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture.

Gravel opposed the use of international sanctions as a policy tool and blamed the ones against Iraq under Saddam Hussein for the deaths of a half-million children in that country. In 2013, Gravel said that sanctions against Iran were &quot;illegal&quot;.

During his 2008 candidacy, Gravel called for a cut in military spending, variously reported to be 15 percent or 50 percent. He called for the savings to boost public education spending. To spur international nuclear nonproliferation efforts, Gravel called for unilateral reductions in the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

In 2008, Gravel criticized the decision of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to not pursue the efforts to impeach George W. Bush and the attempted impeachment of Dick Cheney, saying also that Bush and Cheney had committed crimes and deserved &quot;to be prosecuted&quot; at The Hague. In 2013, he expressed disdain for President Obama, calling him &quot;a total fraud&quot; and saying that both Bush and Obama should be tried &quot;for the crimes and murders they&#x27;ve committed&quot; in the International Court of Justice. Gravel specifically condemned Obama for drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere.

===Economy, immigration, and environment===
During his 2008 candidacy, Gravel favored a FairTax scheme, which would abolish the Internal Revenue Service, eliminate the federal income tax (which Gravel called &quot;corrupt&quot;), and impose a national sales tax. While Gravel described FairTax as &quot;progressive&quot;, others have criticized it as &quot;regressive&quot;, disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest Americans. To offset the new sales taxes on essential goods, Gravel&#x27;s plan called for monthly government rebate payments to individuals and families. During his 2020 campaign Gravel also voiced support for a third legislative body that would give the people direct control of the budget as well as the implementation of a land value tax.

Gravel opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during his 2008 candidacy, calling it unfair and economically harmful and needing renegotiation. Gravel believed that NAFTA was the &quot;root cause&quot; of illegal migration to the U.S. He favored a guest worker program and &quot;setting up naturalization procedures that would fairly bring immigrants into legal status&quot;. In a 2007 interview, Gravel identified himself as &quot;very much of a globalist&quot; who believed in open markets and open borders and condemned the scapegoating of undocumented immigrants. Gravel also said that he favored eliminating the cap on H1B visas.

As a senator from Alaska, Gravel favored drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but opposed it during his 2008 campaign. In 2008, Gravel supported a carbon tax to combat climate change.

Gravel spoke in favor of net neutrality during his presidential campaign.

===Education and health care===
Gravel called for the cost of college tuition to be borne by the federal government, rather than students. In his 2008 campaign, he called the No Child Left Behind Act &quot;a failure&quot; and called for it to be &quot;reformed and fully funded&quot;. He expressed support for universal pre-kindergarten and the expansion of the Head Start program; and expressed an openness to charter schools and school vouchers. He also suggested extending the school day and the school year, and supported merit pay for teachers.

Gravel also called for publicly funded universal health care to replace the current employer-sponsored health insurance system. He supported &quot;full funding&quot; of the VA system. When asked in 2007 about naturopathy, homeopathy, and acupuncture, Gravel said that he was &quot;very very much in favor&quot; of holistic health care.

==Awards and honors==
In 2008, Gravel received the Columbia University School of General Studies&#x27; first annual Isaac Asimov Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>The International Paper Company is an American pulp and paper company, the largest such company in the world. It has approximately 39,000 employees, and is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee.

==History==

The company was incorporated January 31, 1898, upon the merger of 17 pulp and paper mills in the northeastern United States. Its founders and first two presidents were William Augustus Russell, who died suddenly in January 1899, and Hugh J. Chisholm. Philip Tell Dodge, president of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company, served as its chairman for 11 years. The invention of the Linotype dramatically increased the size of newspapers and the need for newsprint. The newly formed company supplied 60 percent of all newsprint in the country.

===Hudson River Mill===

The Hudson River Mill in Corinth, New York, where the Sacandaga River joins the Hudson River, was a pioneer in the development of the modern paper industry in the late 19th century. The first wood-based newsprint paper mill in New York, it was built by Albrecht Pagenstecher in 1869.

In the early 20th century, the Hudson River Mill was one of the company&#x27;s largest plants and served both as its principal office, and a place where paper workers helped shape the direction of the industry&#x27;s early labor movement.

After World War II, Hudson River Mill workers developed the production of coated paper for the company. Shifting economic forces resulted in the mill&#x27;s closure in November 2002. The historic mill was slated for partial demolition during 2011. The work including asbestos removal was completed by Northstar Group Services.

Given the nature of their products, paper plants are highly flammable. Therefore, International Paper Company frequently used asbestos insulation in its walls, floors, and roofs as a protective measure. Asbestos insulation was also used on pipes and boilers throughout International Paper plants. This material intended to protect people turned out to severely damage their health The producers did not reveal that their asbestos products were dangerous, even though asbestos was known to cause illnesses as far back as the 1920s. Consequently, many former employees of International Paper have been diagnosed with mesothelioma following decades of service.

===Mill workers&#x27; strike===

The book &quot;Betrayal of Local 14: Paperworkers, Politics, and Permanent Replacements&quot; was written about the strike at the Androscoggin Mill. The book was written by Julius Gerson Getman, who was an attorney representing the striking paperworkers.

===Acquisitions===

====1986–2000====
In 1986, the company acquired the Hammermill Paper Company, founded in 1898, which managed eleven papermills nationwide, and had its corporate offices based in Erie, PA; in 1988, the Masonite Corporation; and in 1989, the German paper company Zanders Feinpapiere AG and the French paper manufacturer Aussedat Rey. In 1996, it purchased Federal Paper Board. In 1999, the company purchased Union Camp Corporation, and in June 2000 Champion International. Additionally, it owned shares in the Chilean company Copec.

====2011====

Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills Rajahmundry (APPM), which is now an International Paper company, is one of the biggest integrated paper and pulp manufacturing centers in India. The company produces writing, printing, and copier papers and paper boards for foreign and domestic markets. APPM&#x27;s production facilities are two mills in Rajahmundry and Kadiam with a total production capacity of 240,000 TPD (Tons Per Day).

====2012====
In 2012, International Paper acquired Temple-Inland in a deal valued at $4.5 billion. Temple-Inland then became a wholly owned subsidiary of International Paper. At the time of sale, Temple-Inland&#x27;s corrugated packaging operation consisted of 7 mills and 59 converting facilities as well as the building products operation.

====2020s====
International Paper completed the acquisition of British packaging company DS Smith for $7.2 billion in January 2025.

===Restructuring, 2005–2006===
In 2005 and 2006, the company undertook a significant restructuring, selling over of forestland in the U.S., along with its coated paper, kraft paper, wood products, and beverage packaging businesses, as well as subsidiaries Arizona Chemical and New Zealand-based Carter Holt Harvey. The coated paper business (four mills in Maine, Michigan and Minnesota) were sold to Apollo Management and now operate as Verso Paper. The kraft paper business (composed of a kraft paper mill in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina and a dunnage bag plant in Fordyce, Arkansas) was sold to Kapstone Paper and Packaging and operates as Kapstone Kraft Paper.

The beverage packaging business, now called Evergreen Packaging, was purchased by Carter Holt Harvey, following the purchase of CHH by Graeme Hart. The company sold its wood products division to West Fraser Timber, based in Vancouver, British Columbia. This included 13 sawmills, making West Fraser the second-largest producer of lumber in North America, after Weyerhaeuser Company.

===Challenges of an electronic world===
Under pressure from budget sequestration in 2013, the federal government of the United States (IP&#x27;s largest customer) moved from physical checks to cheaper electronic transactions.

==Company logo==
The company&#x27;s former logo was designed by American graphic designers Lester Beall and Richard Rogers in 1960. The logo featured the letters &quot;I&quot; and &quot;P&quot; which formed a stylized arrow also resembling a tree surrounded by a circle. A primary constraint in the design process was the need for a logo simple enough that it could be stenciled onto trees and lumber intended for paper production. On March 7, 2023, the company announced a rebrand to coincide with the company&#x27;s 125th anniversary. The rebrand included a new logo which features a stylized monogram, composed of green elements forming the two letters. Each of the elements features a straight top line and a rounded bottom. The dark green emblem is placed on the left from the two-leveled title case inscription in a modern sans-serif typeface, in black. 

==Headquarters==
International Paper owns Tower I (at 6400 Poplar) and occupies the entire property and leases 50,000 square feet in Tower II (at 6410 Poplar) and all of Tower III (at 6420 Poplar).

In 2000, International Place Tower III was designed and rests amid the two existing towers and courtyard. The Crump Firm designed the eleven-story, 234,000 square foot tower to include offices, conference rooms, training rooms and dining facilities. The exterior granite was bought and warehoused in the mid-1980s with the intent that its construction would mimic that of the earlier towers. However, inclusion of seismic criteria to the Memphis building code in 1994 made the initial design unable to move forward. Therefore, architects had to completely change the original structural design in order to adhere to the strict exterior dimensions needed to utilize the existing granite and to match the existing towers.

In 2012, it was announced that International Paper was building a $90.2 million, 235,000-square-foot tower at 6430 Poplar Ave. in East Memphis.

In addition to the four office towers at International Place, the company operates an airport hangar facility (at 2522 Winchester Road) and a Southwind data center at (3232 Players Club Parkway). Other company related facilities include a recycling center on South Third and two warehouse operations across Memphis.

==Products and corporate structure==


The company used to be the largest producer of plastic lids and paper cups, manufacturing for the fast-food giants McDonald&#x27;s, Wendy&#x27;s, Subway, but its consumer packaging division was sold to Graphic Packaging on January 2, 2018. Its wood products division was sold in 2007 to West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd., a company headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia. The company produces printer and copier paper, envelopes, corrugated packaging and pulp.

The company is a former Dow Jones Industrial Average component, included in the index from July 3, 1956, to April 7, 2004. It was one of three components to be dropped in the 2004 change, together with AT&amp;T Corporation and Eastman Kodak.

Beginning February 1, 2007, the sale of the beverage-packaging division was completed as New Zealand billionaire Graeme Hart won the bid with purchase price of nearly $800 million. The division now operates under the Evergreen label.

On March 17, 2008, the company announced it was buying the containerboard unit of Weyerhaeuser for $6 billion in cash.

In October 2007, it formed a joint venture with Ilim Holding, Ilim Group, the alliance in the Russian forest sector.

On July 1, 2014, the company announced the completion of the xpedx spinoff which merged with Unisource, creating an independent company, Veritiv Corporation.

On May 2, 2016, it announced the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser&#x27;s cellulose fiber division. The acquisition was completed on Dec 1, 2016.

On Oct 1, 2021 a spin-off was completed creating a stand alone company by the name of Sylvamo. Sylvamo&#x27;s headquarters are also located in Memphis TN. Divested were the Printing &amp; Communications (White Uncoated Freesheet) mills in Ticonderoga NY, Eastover SC, Mogi Guacu Brazil, Luiz Antonio Brazil, Tres Lagoas Brazil, Saillat France, and Svetogorsk Russia.

<text>Georgia-Pacific LLC is an American pulp and paper company based in Atlanta, Georgia, and is one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers and distributors of tissue, pulp, paper, toilet and paper towel dispensers, packaging, building products and related chemicals, and other forest products—largely made from its own timber. Since 2005, it has been an independently operated and managed subsidiary of Koch Industries. As of fall 2019, the company employed more than 35,000 people at more than 180 locations in North America, South America and Europe.

==History==

Georgia-Pacific was founded by Owen Robertson Cheatham on September 22, 1927 in Augusta, Georgia, as the Georgia Hardwood Lumber Co. He started the company through the acquisition of a wholesale hardwood lumber yard. The nascent company encountered difficulties two years after its incorporation as the United States fell into the Great Depression. Due to slow demand, the company only had five employees in 1934. Over the years it expanded, adding sawmills and plywood plants. The company acquired its first West Coast facility in 1947 and changed its name to Georgia-Pacific Plywood &amp; Lumber Company in 1948.

In 1956, the company changed its name to Georgia-Pacific Corporation. In 1957—led by new president Robert B. Pamplin (who would lead for two decades)—the company entered the pulp and paper business by building a kraft pulp and linerboard mill at Toledo, Oregon. This was the only pulp and paper mill that the company ever built. The company continued to make a series of acquisitions, including Union Lumber (owned by Boise Cascade) in 1973, US Plywood in 1987, American Forest Products Corporation in 1988, Great Northern Nekoosa in 1990, and the Fort James Corporation in 2000. The Fort James Corporation was the result of a series of mergers of enterprises that included the Fort Howard Corporation, the James River Corporation and Crown-Zellerbach.

In 1996, Georgia-Pacific sold its operations in Martell, California and its surrounding timberlands to Sierra Pacific Industries. In 1999, Georgia-Pacific sold its California timber lands to Hawthorne Timber. In 2000, Georgia-Pacific sold its remaining timber lands to Plum Creek Timber. In August 2001, Georgia-Pacific completed the sale of four un-coated paper mills and their associated businesses and assets to Canadian papermaker Domtar for .

It was announced on November 13, 2005 that Georgia-Pacific would be acquired by Koch Industries. On December 23, 2005, Koch Industries finalized the $21 billion acquisition of Georgia-Pacific. Georgia-Pacific was removed from the NYSE (it had traded under the symbol GP) and shareholders surrendered their shares for about $48 per share.

The Georgia-Pacific Tower in Atlanta continues to house the company&#x27;s headquarters. The Crown Zellerbach Building was built as the headquarters of Crown Zellerbach in San Francisco in 1959.

On January 11, 2010, Georgia-Pacific signed an agreement to acquire Grant Forest Products&#x27; oriented strand board (&quot;OSB&quot;) facility at Englehart, Ontario and the associated facility at Earlton, Ontario, as well as its OSB facilities at Clarendon and Allendale, South Carolina, for approximately $400 million. The transaction closed in July 2013, following Canadian regulatory review and US court approval under the Hart–Scott–Rodino merger review process.

On June 19, 2014, Georgia-Pacific announced it will acquire SPG Holdings.

In 2018, Georgia-Pacific&#x27;s facilities in Taylorsville, Mississippi were the site of a two-week labor strike.

==Environmental record==


Stephen Engelberg of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that in 1995, Georgia-Pacific persuaded the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee to approve an amendment that derailed a pending E.P.A. investigation of Weyerhaeuser Company, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, and Georgia-Pacific, arguing that the E.P.A. was &quot;unfairly applying present-day standards to decisions made 10 to 15 years ago&quot;, and that the E.P.A. test method overstated the emissions from wood products factories. Georgia-Pacific&#x27;s opponents believed &quot;the measure could allow Georgia-Pacific avoid installing pollution gear at many of its plants.&quot; Engelberg wrote, &quot;Nonetheless, [Georgia-Pacific] said they would install controls at plants that need them.&quot;

Georgia-Pacific is also involved in several remediation sites, many of which were landfills used by other manufacturers, municipalities and other businesses, and individuals. Two of the primary remediation sites - the Fox River in Wisconsin and Kalamazoo River in Michigan - involve the cleanup of PCBs. Georgia Pacific is contributing to dam removal work as part of an effort to clean up PCB contamination in Kalamazoo.

In 2007, the EPA announced legal agreements among itself, Michigan, Georgia-Pacific, and Millennium Holdings (a corporate successor of the Allied Paper Corporation) requiring the companies to clean up an estimated $21,000,000 worth of environmental damage to the Plainwell Impoundment Area. Another settlement required an additional $15,000,000 of environmental work on the Kalamazoo River Superfund Site.

Georgia-Pacific is the largest user of de-ink fiber in the world, and its subsidiary company GP Harmon trades in the recycled material. The company has expanded into other markets in countries like Mexico and China. In 2005, president of the division Simon Davies estimated that China would require the import of scrap paper from the US and elsewhere for at least 15 years. In the long run, he asserted, the growth of the Chinese middle class would be correlated with a large increase in paper production, and having viable paper recovery systems in place would be of great value to them.

The Georgia-Pacific Paper Mill in Crossett, Arkansas was the subject of environmental documentary film &quot;Company Town&quot;, released in 2016. The film alleges that improper waste disposal by the mill has caused a cluster of cancer incidents in the area around the mill.

==Awards and charity==
In 2009, the EPA awarded Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific its SmartWay Excellence award, &quot;an innovative collaboration between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the freight industry designed to increase energy efficiency while significantly reducing air pollution,&quot; and specifically commended Georgia-Pacific. The award states:
In, 2008, 93 percent of Georgia-Pacific&#x27;s freight was hauled by SmartWay Transport Partners, an increase of 47 percent over the previous year. Of the 145 carriers Georgia-Pacific uses, 104 were SmartWay carriers, an increase of 33 percent over 2007. In 2008, Georgia-Pacific experienced tremendous growth in its intermodal shipping. Georgia-Pacific was able to work with its customers to increase lead-time and create more intermodal freight shipments without significantly impacting customer&#x27;s needs, thus increasing intermodal loads by 39 percent in 2008 as compared to 2007. Georgia-Pacific uses advanced software to pack loads more efficiently and increase cube utilization in its trailers. The company also reduced empty loads by 10 percent, increased utilization of local fleets, and established an idling reduction policy in place at its 12 distribution centers. In the summer of 2008, Georgia Pacific held a fuel conservation summit to explore ways for shippers and carriers to work together to further reduce fuel consumption from its freight transport operations.
The Georgia-Pacific Foundation Scholarship Program for Employees&#x27; Children has awarded nearly $10.5 million in college scholarships to children of the company&#x27;s employees between 1988 and 2013.

<text>Nipawin () is a town in Saskatchewan, Canada, on the Saskatchewan River portion of Tobin Lake. The town lies between Codette Lake, created by the Francois-Finlay Dam (built in 1986) and Tobin Lake, created by the E.B. Campbell Dam built in 1963, renamed from Squaw Rapids. The construction of Francois-Finlay Dam earned Nipawin the nickname the &quot;Town of Two Lakes&quot;.

Nipawin is bordered by the Rural Municipality of Nipawin No. 487 and the Rural Municipality of Torch River No. 488 (the latter across the Saskatchewan River).

Highway 35 and Highway 55 intersect in Nipawin. The Nipawin Airport and the Nipawin Water Aerodrome also serve the community.

Nipawin is a Cree word meaning &quot;a bed, or resting place&quot; which referred to a low-lying area along the river now flooded by Codette Lake where First Nations women and children would camp and wait for the men to arrive.

== History ==

The first permanent settlement of Nipawin occurred in 1910 with the establishment of a trading post. In 1924 a branch-line of the Canadian Pacific Railway passed nearby, crossing the North Saskatchewan River over the Crooked Bridge, and the settlement was moved, building by building, to its current location alongside the railway line.

The Nipawin Historical Society&#x27;s publication, &quot;Bridging the years : Nipawin, Saskatchewan&quot;, published in 1988, presents the settlement&#x27;s early history.

=== Exploration and Fur trade ===
In 1751, a group of New France soldiers commanded by Joseph Boucher de Niverville may have built a short-lived fort, Fort La Jonquière, near the site of Nipawin.

Severalfur trading posts may have operated at various times in the area, but they are poorly documented. In 1763 Joseph Smith reached the area from York Factory. In 1768 James Finlay from Montreal built a post. François le Blanc, apparently the man known as &quot;Saswe&quot;, had a post by that year or the next. In 1790 William Thorburn built there then moved to Hungry Hall the following year. 

In 1795 two posts operated in the area, one run by A. N. McLeod for the North West Company and another run by James Porter working for David Grant.

=== Recent history ===
On April 18, 2008, a downtown meat shop exploded, destroying three buildings as well as damaging several more. The explosion killed two and injured five. The explosion is suspected to have been caused by a backhoe that snagged and sheared a natural gas riser from the main line. The explosion prompted the implementation of a state of emergency by the mayor. The explosion received extensive national news coverage.

<text>The RealDoll is a life-size sex doll (also considered a mannequin) manufactured by Abyss Creations, LLC in Las Vegas, Nevada, and sold worldwide. It has a poseable PVC skeleton with steel joints and silicone flesh.

==Details and history==
The RealDolls are designed to recreate the appearance, texture, and weight of human female and male bodies. Their primary function is to serve as sex partners. This activity can be accompanied by certain preparations such as dressing them up in different types of clothes, changing wigs or makeup, and even adjusting body temperature by the use of electric blankets or baths.

Early prototypes were made from solid latex with an interior skeleton, but construction of the outer material was later switched to silicone. In June 2009, Abyss Creations switched from tin cure silicone to platinum silicone, which resulted in dolls that are less prone to tears and compression marks than older RealDolls. 

The current incarnation of the female Real Doll product was introduced in 1996. In 2003, Abyss introduced the &quot;Face-X&quot; system, allowing any face to be interchangeable with any body. Multiple faces can then be attached one at a time to a single doll by the owner. As of 2011, there are nine female bodies and 16 female faces in the first product line. In 2009 the RealDoll 2 was introduced, which feature removable inserts for the mouth and vagina and faces that attach by magnets instead of Velcro. The line started with two female bodies and three female faces and, as of 2013, offered ten faces and three bodies of females. Another female body is in the development phase.

Charlie, the first male Real Doll, was retired in 2008 and replaced with two body types and three head types. Transgender dolls may also be purchased from the company, although these must be custom ordered. Abyss also sells silicone toys such as female torso products and dildos among other offerings.

For a time, the company also offered customizations such as robotic hip actuators, finger skeletons (instead of the usual wire finger armatures), and computer-controlled speech feedback, but these expensive options are no longer available.

==In popular culture==
*A Cyanide &amp; Happiness short, in which Pinocchio exclaims &quot;I want to be a RealDoll!&quot;.
* A film entitled &quot;Love Object&quot; starring Desmond Harrington was released in 2003 that deals with a lonely man&#x27;s purchase of a RealDoll that may be more real than he thinks.
* Dave Hockey&#x27;s documentary &quot;All Dolled Up.&quot; 
* Glamour and high fashion photographer Helmut Newton photographed RealDolls. A sample can be found in his autobiography. &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine reportedly refused to publish Newton&#x27;s RealDoll photo shoot, considering it too weird, according to his account.
* Nick Holt&#x27;s &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; television documentary for North One Television (renamed &quot;Love Me, Love My Doll&quot; for broadcast on BBC America) follows the lives of four men who live with RealDolls.

<doc id="293588" wikidata="Q2667821" url="?curid=293588" title="Teledildonics">
<text>Teledildonics (also known as cyberdildonics) is the name coined for virtual sex encounters using networked electronic sex toys to mimic and extend human sexual interaction. The term became known after technology critic and writer Howard Rheingold used it in his 1991 book &quot;Virtual Reality&quot;. In the publication, Rheingold made futuristic conclusions and summaries surrounding technology and used the term &#x27;teledildonics&#x27; to refer to remote sexual activity using technology. Nowadays, the term is commonly used to describe remote sex (or, at least, remote mutual masturbation), where tactile sensations are communicated over a remote connection between the participants. The term can also refer to the integration of telepresence with sexual activity that these interfaces make possible and can be used in conjunction or interchangeably with sex-technology. The term has also been used less accurately (since there&#x27;s no &quot;&quot; element) to refer to robotic sex, i.e., computer-controlled sex toys that aim to substitute for or improve upon sex with a human partner. Nowadays, it is commonly used to refer to Bluetooth-enabled sex toys.

==Background==
Teledildonics is commonly used to describe Bluetooth-enabled sex toys, many of which have entered the market in the last decade. As well as being open to a remote connection for control, some toys can also be connected with corresponding devices to deliver synchronized movements between couples and remote partners. Teledildonics have also been used within the adult industry to create &#x27;immersive&#x27; webcam shows, whereby users control the vibrations of the webcammers sex toy. Some media outlets have reported on &#x27;teldildonic&#x27; technology used by long-distance couples in order to maintain sexual relations.

As well as offering remote functions, many teledildonic toys can be synchronized with pornography movies. Synchronization of porn with teledildonic or Bluetooth toys actions are controlled by means of a previously-written script. A report in 2008 suggested that teledildonics, along with text and email and webcams, can be used to &quot;wind each other up to fever pitch during the working day&quot; as a prelude to sex with a human during the evening hours. New technologies can help people establish &quot;emotional connections&quot; via the web. Indeed, teledildonics technology has already been integrated with adult online webcam services and certain sex toys, such as OhMiBod, Lovense, and We-Vibe. One Dutch manufacturer, KIIROO, offers a two-way connection between both female and male sex toys.

==History ==
The term was coined as early as 1975 by Ted Nelson in his book &quot;Computer Lib/Dream Machines&quot;. The idea of virtual sex has been prominent in literature, fiction and popular culture, and promoters of these devices have claimed since the 1980s they are the &quot;next big thing&quot; in cybersex technology. At the time Howard Rhinegold started using this term in 1990s, there were already many enthusiasts seeking to explore the power of technology, sex and intimacy. A report in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1993 suggested that teledildonics was &quot;the virtual-reality technology that may one day allow people wearing special bodysuits, headgear and gloves to engage in tactile sexual relations from separate, remote locations via computers connected to phone lines.&quot; It was the same year that the Cyber-SM suit was released by Stahl Stensile, which featured on the cover of &quot;FutureSex&quot;, a 1990s San Francisco–based magazine that focused on the emergence of teledildonics. Some products have been shown at the Museum of Sex in New York City and there was an exhibition about Stensile&#x27;s Cyber-SM suit in 2016.

The responses to teledildonics have been mixed; however, the dominant concern has centered on the separation of personal intimacy and embodied presence. In the words of one early text on the subject:


== Patent issues ==
Many companies experimenting in the field have been hit with patent lawsuits. In particular, U.S. Patent No. 6,368,268 titled &quot;Method and device for interactive virtual control of sexual aids using digital computer networks&quot; effectively claimed priority over the entire field of controlling sex toys via the Internet.

At the 2016 South by Southwest Festival, virtual reality entrepreneur Ela Darling asserted that patent holders were preventing the production of teledildonic technology.

The patent expired in August 2018, lowering the barrier of entry to the field.
