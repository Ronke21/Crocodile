<text>Sir Anthony van Dyck (; ; 22 March 1599 – 9 December 1641) was a Flemish Baroque artist who became the leading court painter in England after success in the Spanish Netherlands and Italy.

The seventh child of Frans van Dyck, a wealthy silk merchant in Antwerp, Anthony painted from an early age. He was successful as an independent painter in his late teens and became a master in the Antwerp Guild on 18 October 1617. By this time, he was working in the studio of the leading northern painter of the day, Peter Paul Rubens, who became a major influence on his work.

Van Dyck worked in London for some months in 1621, then returned to Flanders for a brief time, before travelling to Italy, where he stayed until 1627, mostly in Genoa. In the late 1620s he completed his greatly admired &quot;Iconography&quot; series of portrait etchings of mainly other artists and other famous contemporaries. He spent five years in Flanders after his return from Italy, and from 1630 was court painter for the Archduchess Isabella, Habsburg Governor of Flanders. At the request of Charles I of England he returned in 1632 to London as the main court painter.

With the exception of Holbein, van Dyck and his contemporary Diego Velázquez were the first painters of pre-eminent talent to work mainly as court portraitists, revolutionising the genre. Van Dyck is best known for his portraits of the aristocracy, most notably Charles I, and his family and associates. He was the dominant influence on English portrait-painting for over 150 years. He also painted mythological, allegorical and biblical subjects, including altarpieces, displayed outstanding facility as a draughtsman, and was an important innovator in watercolour and etching.

His influence extends into the modern period. The Van Dyke beard is named after him. During his lifetime, Charles I granted him a knighthood, and he was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, an indication of his standing at the time of his death.

==Life and work==
===Family and early life===
Anthony van Dyck was born in Antwerp on 22 March 1599 as the seventh of 12 children of his parents. He was baptized the next day in the Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk (now the Antwerp Cathedral) His father was Frans van Dyck, a well-to-do silk merchant. His mother was Maria Cupers (or Cuypers), daughter of Dirk Cupers (or Cuypers) and Catharina Conincx and the second wife of Anthony&#x27;s father. He was baptised on 23 March 1599 (as Anthonio). His parental grandfather, also called Anthoni, had commenced his career as a painter and had been registered in 1556 as a master painter at the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a pupil of Jan Ghendrick, alias van Cleve. The elder brother of his grandfather was also admitted as master painter in the Guild and had studied with Geert Ghendrick., He had later become a successful merchant in silk and small writing articles. He had bought the birth house of Anthony called Den Berendans (The Bear Dance) on the Grote Markt in Antwerp (Main Square) in 1579. On Anthony&#x27;s mother&#x27;s side there were also a few artists who were Guild members.
After his birth his family moved to a house called the Kasteel van Rijssel (Castle of Lille) in the Korte Nieuwstraat. His mother died when he was only 8 years old. At the time the family was living in a more luxurious house in the Korte Nieuwstraat called the Stadt van Ghent (City of Ghent). His artistic talent was evident very early. When he was 10 years old, he started his formal training as a painter with Hendrick van Balen the Elder. Van Balen was a successful painter of small cabinet paintings who had multiple pupils. It is not known how long he studied with van Balen, and estimates vary from two to four years. While it was common for apprentices to stay on in their master&#x27;s workshop until they were formally registered as a master in the local guild, van Dyck is believed to have left his master&#x27;s workshop in 1615 or 1616 to set up his independent workshop before he became a master. The reason was that in that period his father was experiencing financial difficulties and could use any assistance he could get. It was during the period van Dyck may have started painting the series of panels of Christ and the Apostles in bust-length, although it is also possible that this only happened after his first return from Italy in 1620–21.

By the age of fifteen he was already a highly accomplished artist, as shown by his &quot;Self-portrait&quot; dated 1613–14. He was admitted to the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a free master on Saint Luke&#x27;s day, 18 October 1617.

Within a few years he became the chief assistant to Peter Paul Rubens, the leading master painter of Antwerp and the whole of Northern Europe. Rubens operated a large workshop and often relied on sub-contracted artists. His influence on the young artist was immense. Rubens referred to the nineteen-year-old van Dyck as &quot;the best of my pupils&quot;.
The origins and exact nature of their relationship are unclear. It has been speculated that van Dyck was a pupil of Rubens from about 1613, as even his early work shows little trace of van Balen&#x27;s style, but there is no clear evidence for this.

At the same time the dominance of Rubens in the relatively small and declining city of Antwerp probably explains why, despite his periodic returns to the city, van Dyck spent most of his career abroad. In 1620, in Rubens&#x27;s contract for the major commission for the ceiling of the Carolus Borromeuskerk, the Jesuit church at Antwerp (lost to fire in 1718), van Dyck is specified as one of the &quot;discipelen&quot; who was to execute the paintings to Rubens&#x27; designs. Unlike van Dyck, Rubens worked for most of the courts of Europe, but avoided exclusive attachment to any of them.

===Italy===
In 1620, at the instigation of George Villiers, Marquess of Buckingham, van Dyck went to England for the first time where he worked for King James I of England, receiving £100. It was in London in the collection of the Earl of Arundel that he first saw the work of Titian, whose use of colour and subtle modeling of form would prove transformational, offering a new stylistic language that would enrich the compositional lessons learned from Rubens.
He returned to Flanders after about four months, and then left in late 1621 for Italy, where he remained for six years. There he studied the Italian masters while starting a successful career as a portraitist. He was already presenting himself as a figure of consequence, annoying the rather bohemian Northern artist&#x27;s colony in Rome, says Giovan Pietro Bellori, by appearing with &quot;the pomp of Zeuxis ... his behaviour was that of a nobleman rather than an ordinary person, and he shone in rich garments. Since he was accustomed in the circle of Rubens to noblemen, and being naturally of elevated mind, and anxious to make himself distinguished, he therefore wore—as well as silks—a hat with feathers and brooches, gold chains across his chest, and was accompanied by servants.&quot;
He was mostly based in Genoa, although he also travelled extensively to other cities, and stayed for some time in Palermo in Sicily, where he was quarantined during the 1624 plague, one of the worst in Sicily&#x27;s history. There he produced an important series of paintings of the city&#x27;s plague saint Saint Rosalia. His depictions of a young woman with flowing blonde hair wearing a Franciscan cowl and reaching down toward the city of Palermo in its peril, became the standard iconography of the saint from that time onward and was extremely influential for Italian Baroque painters, from Luca Giordano to Pietro Novelli. Versions include those in Madrid, Houston, London, New York and Palermo, as well as Saint Rosalia Interceding for the City of Palermo in Puerto Rico, and Coronation of Saint Rosalia in Vienna. Van Dyck&#x27;s series of St Rosalia paintings have been studied by Gauvin Alexander Bailey and Xavier F. Salomon, both of whom curated or co-curated exhibitions devoted to the theme of Italian art and the plague. In 2020, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published an article about the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s painting of Saint Rosalia by Van Dyck in the context of the COVID-19 virus.

For the Genoese aristocracy, then in a final flush of prosperity, he developed a full-length portrait style, drawing on Veronese and Titian as well as Rubens&#x27; style from his own period in Genoa, where extremely tall but graceful figures look down on the viewer with great hauteur. In 1627, he went back to Antwerp where he remained for five years, painting more affable portraits which still made his Flemish patrons look as stylish as possible. A life-size group portrait of twenty-four City Councillors of Brussels he painted for the council-chamber was destroyed in 1695. He was evidently very charming to his patrons, and, like Rubens, well able to mix in aristocratic and court circles, which added to his ability to obtain commissions. By 1630, he was described as the court painter of the Habsburg Governor of Flanders, the Archduchess Isabella. In this period he also produced many religious works, including large altarpieces, and began his printmaking.
=== London and death ===
King Charles I was the most passionate collector of art among the Stuart kings and saw painting as a way of promoting his elevated view of the monarchy. In 1628, he bought the fabulous collection that the Duke of Mantua was forced to sell, and he had been trying since his accession in 1625 to bring leading foreign painters to England. In 1626, he was able to persuade Orazio Gentileschi to settle in England, later to be joined by his daughter Artemisia and some of his sons. Rubens was an especial target, who eventually in 1630 came on a diplomatic mission, which included painting, and he later sent Charles more paintings from Antwerp. Rubens was very well-treated during his nine-month visit, during which he was knighted. Charles&#x27;s court portraitist, Daniel Mytens, was a somewhat pedestrian Dutchman. Charles was very short, less than tall, and presented challenges to a portrait artist.

Van Dyck remained in touch with the English court and helped King Charles&#x27;s agents in their search for pictures. He sent some of his own works, including a self-portrait (1623) with Endymion Porter, one of Charles&#x27;s agents, his &quot;Rinaldo and Armida&quot; (1629), and a religious picture for Queen Henrietta Maria. He had also painted Charles&#x27;s sister, Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia, at The Hague in 1632. In April of that year, van Dyck returned to London and was taken under the wing of the court immediately, being knighted in July and at the same time receiving a pension of £200 a year, in the grant of which he was described as &quot;principalle Paynter in ordinary to their majesties&quot;. 
He was well paid for his paintings in addition to this, at least in theory, as King Charles did not actually pay over his pension for five years and reduced the price of many paintings. He was provided with a house on the River Thames at Blackfriars, then just outside the City of London, thus avoiding the monopoly of the Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers. A suite of rooms in Eltham Palace, no longer used by the royal family, was also put at his disposal as a country retreat. These residences were managed by his partner Margaret Lemon.

His Blackfriars studio was frequently visited by the King and Queen (later a special causeway was built to ease their access), who hardly sat for another painter while van Dyck lived.

He was an immediate success in England, where he painted large numbers of portraits of the King and Queen, as well as their children. Many portraits were done in several versions, to be sent as diplomatic gifts or given to supporters of the increasingly embattled king. Altogether van Dyck has been estimated to have painted forty portraits of King Charles himself, as well as about thirty of the Queen, nine of the Earl of Strafford, and multiple ones of other courtiers. He painted many of the court, and also himself and his mistress, Margaret Lemon.
In England he developed a version of his style which combined a relaxed elegance and ease with an understated authority in his subjects which was to dominate English portrait-painting to the end of the 18th century. His portraits of Charles on horseback updated the grandeur of Titian&#x27;s &quot;Equestrian Portrait of Charles V&quot;, but even more effective and original is his portrait of Charles dismounted in the Louvre: &quot;Charles is given a totally natural look of instinctive sovereignty, in a deliberately informal setting where he strolls so negligently that he seems at first glance nature&#x27;s gentleman rather than England&#x27;s King&quot;. Although his portraits have created the classic idea of &quot;Cavalier&quot; style and dress, in fact a majority of his most important patrons in the nobility, such as Lord Wharton and the Earls of Bedford, Northumberland and Pembroke, took the Parliamentarian side in the English Civil War that broke out soon after his death.

The King in Council by letters patent granted van Dyck &quot;denizenship&quot; in 1638. On 27 February 1640 he married Mary Ruthven, with whom he had one daughter. Mary was the daughter of Patrick Ruthven, who, although the title was forfeited, styled himself Lord Ruthven. She was a lady-in-waiting to the Queen in 1639–40; this may have been instigated by the King in an attempt to keep him in England. He had spent most of 1634 in Antwerp, returning the following year, and in 1640–41, as the Civil War loomed, spent several months in Flanders and France. In 1640 he accompanied prince John Casimir of Poland after he was freed from French imprisonment.

A letter dated 13 August 1641, from Lady Roxburghe in England to a correspondent in The Hague, reported that van Dyck was recuperating from a long illness. In November, van Dyck&#x27;s condition worsened, and he returned to England from Paris, where he had gone to paint Cardinal Richelieu. He died in Blackfriars, London on 9 December 1641, the same day as the baptism of his daughter Justiniana. He was buried on 11 December, in the choir of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. His mortal remains and tomb (erected by the king) were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666.

==Portraits and other works==
In the 17th century, demand for portraits was stronger than for other types of work. Van Dyck tried to persuade Charles to commission large-scale series on the history of the Order of the Garter for the Banqueting House, Whitehall, for which Rubens had earlier completed the large ceiling paintings (sending them from Antwerp). A sketch for one wall remains, but by 1638 Charles was too short of money to proceed. This was a problem Velázquez did not have, but equally van Dyck&#x27;s daily life was not encumbered by trivial court duties as faced by Velázquez. In his visits to Paris in his last years, van Dyck attempted to obtain the commission to paint the Grande Gallerie of the Louvre without success.
A list of history paintings produced by van Dyck in England survives. It was compiled by van Dyck&#x27;s biographer Bellori, based on information from Sir Kenelm Digby. None of these works appear to remain, except the &quot;Eros and Psyche&quot; done for the King (below). But many other works, rather more religious than mythological, do survive, and though they are very fine, they do not reach the heights of Velázquez&#x27;s history paintings. Earlier ones remain very much within the style of Rubens, although some of his Sicilian works are individualistic.

Van Dyck&#x27;s portraits flattered more than Velázquez&#x27;s. When Sophia of Hanover first met Queen Henrietta Maria (who was in exile in Holland) in 1641, she wrote: &quot;Van Dyck&#x27;s handsome portraits had given me so fine an idea of the beauty of all English ladies, that I was surprised to find that the Queen, who looked so fine in painting, was a small woman raised up on her chair, with long skinny arms and teeth like defence works projecting from her mouth...&quot;

Some critics have blamed van Dyck for diverting a nascent, tougher English portrait tradition—of painters such as William Dobson, Robert Walker and Isaac Fuller—into what certainly became elegant blandness in the hands of many of van Dyck&#x27;s successors, like Lely or Kneller. The conventional view has always been more favourable: &quot;When Van Dyck came hither he brought Face-Painting to us; ever since which time ... England has excel&#x27;d all the World in that great Branch of the Art&quot; (Jonathan Richardson: &quot;An Essay on the Theory of Painting&quot;, 1715, 41). Thomas Gainsborough is reported to have said on his deathbed &quot;We are all going to heaven, and Van Dyck is of the Company.&quot;
A fairly small number of landscape pen and wash drawings or watercolours made in England played an important part in introducing the Flemish watercolour landscape tradition to England. Some are studies, which reappear in the background of paintings, but many are signed and dated and were probably regarded as finished works to be given as presents. Several of the most detailed are of Rye, a port for ships to the Continent, suggesting that van Dyck did them casually whilst waiting for wind or tide to improve.

==Printmaking==

Probably during his period in Antwerp after his return from Italy, van Dyck began his &quot;Iconographie&quot;, which became a very large series of prints with half-length portraits of eminent contemporaries. He produced drawings, and for eighteen of the portraits he himself etched the heads and main outlines of the figure, for an engraver to work up: &quot;Portrait etching had scarcely had an existence before his time, and in his work it suddenly appears at the highest point ever reached in the art&quot;.
He left most of the printmaking to specialists, who engraved after his drawings. His etched plates appear not to have been published until after his death, and early states are very rare. Most of his plates were printed after only his work had been done. Some exist in further states after engraving had been added, sometimes obscuring his etching. He continued to add to the series until at least his departure for England, and presumably added Inigo Jones whilst in London.

The series was a great success, but was his only venture into printmaking; portraiture probably paid better. At his death there were eighty plates by others, of which fifty-two were of artists, as well as his own eighteen. The plates were bought by a publisher; with the plates reworked periodically as they wore out they continued to be printed for centuries, and the series added to, so that it reached over two hundred portraits by the late 18th century. In 1851, the plates were bought by the &quot;Calcographie du Louvre&quot;.

The &quot;Iconographie&quot; was highly influential as a commercial model for reproductive printmaking; now forgotten series of portrait prints were enormously popular until the advent of photography: &quot;the importance of this series was enormous, and it provided a repertory of images that were plundered by portrait painters throughout Europe over the next couple of centuries&quot;. Van Dyck&#x27;s brilliant etching style, which depended on open lines and dots, was in marked contrast to that of the other great portraitist in prints of the period, Rembrandt, and had little influence until the 19th century, when it had a great influence on artists such as Whistler in the last major phase of portrait etching. Hyatt Mayor wrote:

==Studio==
Van Dyck&#x27;s success led him to maintain a large workshop in London, which became &quot;virtually a production line for portraits&quot;. According to a visitor he usually only made a drawing on paper, which was then enlarged onto canvas by an assistant; he then painted the head himself. He often used blue paper for these preparatory studies. The costume in which the client wished to be painted was left at the studio and often with the unfinished canvas sent out to artists specialised in rendering such clothing. In his last years these studio collaborations accounted for some decline in the quality of work.

In addition many copies untouched by him, or virtually so, were produced by the workshop, as well as by professional copyists and later painters. The number of paintings ascribed to him had by the 19th century become huge, as with Rembrandt, Titian and others. However, most of his assistants and copyists could not approach the refinement of his manner, so compared to many masters consensus among art historians on attributions to him is usually relatively easy to reach, and museum labelling is now mostly updated (country house attributions may be more dubious in some cases).

The relatively few names of his assistants that are known are Dutch or Flemish. He probably preferred to use trained Flemish artists, as no equivalent English training existed in this period. Van Dyck&#x27;s enormous influence on English art does not come from a tradition handed down through his pupils. In fact it is not possible to document a connection to his studio for any English painter of any significance. Dutchman Adriaen Hanneman (1604–1671) returned to his native city, The Hague in 1638 to become the leading portraitist there.

Flemish painter Pieter Thijs studied in van Dyck&#x27;s workshop as one of van Dyck&#x27;s last pupils. He became a very successful portrait and history painter in his native Antwerp.
==Legacy==
Much later, the styles worn by his models provided the names of the Van Dyke beard for the sharply pointed and trimmed goatees popular for men in his day, and the van Dyke collar, &quot;a wide collar across the shoulders edged copiously with lace&quot;. During the reign of George III, a generic &quot;Cavalier&quot; fancy-dress costume called a &quot;Van Dyke&quot; was popular. Gainsborough&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Boy&quot; is wearing such a &quot;Van Dyke&quot; outfit. In 1774 Derby porcelain advertised a figure, after a portrait by Johann Zoffany, of &quot;the King in a Vandyck dress&quot;.

A confusing number of different pigments used in painting have been called &quot;Vandyke brown&quot; (mostly in English-language sources). Some predate van Dyck, and it is not clear that he used any of them. Van Dyke brown is an early photographic printing process using such a colour.

When van Dyck was knighted in 1632, he anglicized his name to Vandyke. The heraldic blazon of his coat of arms is &quot;Quarters 1 &amp; 4. Azure six roundels 3, 2 and 1 Or and for augmentation on a chief Gules a lion passant gardant Or. 2 &amp; 3. Sable a saltire Or. Over all an inescutcheon Or thereon a bend sinister Azure&quot;. The coat of arms is crested with a greyhound&#x27;s head.

==Collections==
The British Royal Collection, which still contains many of his paintings, has a total of twenty-six paintings. The National Gallery, London (fourteen works), The (Spain) (twenty-five Works, such as: &quot;Self-portrait with Endymion Porter&quot;, &quot;The Metal Serpent&quot;, &quot;Christ Crowned with Thorns&quot;, &quot;The taking of Christ&quot;, &quot;Portrait of Mary Ruthven&quot;, the painter&#x27;s Wife), The Louvre in Paris (eighteen works), the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Frick Collection have examples of his portrait style. Wilton House still holds the works he did for one of his main patrons, the Earl of Pembroke, including his largest work, a huge family group portrait with ten main figures. Spanish museums own a rich presence of this artist in addition to The Prado&#x27;s ensemble. The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum preserves &quot;the Portrait of Jacques Le Roy&quot;, property of The Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection but also on display at the Museum there&#x27;s a &quot;Crucified Christ&quot;, and The Bilbao Fine Arts Museum houses a great &quot;Lamentation before the dead Christ&quot;. In 2008, Patrimonio Nacional of Spain recovered a &quot;Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian&quot; and returned it to El Escorial, two centuries after its removal and, subsequently, The Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando has revealed as its own a long-stored painting, added to another, &quot;The Virgin with the Child with the repentant sinners&quot;, in addition the institution has an original sketch. In addition, in December 2017, a &quot;Virgin with Child&quot;, which is kept in The Cerralbo Museum and was previously considered the work of Mateo Cerezo, was revealed as the painter&#x27;s original after an exhaustive study and restoration project. Finally, The Museum of Fine Arts of Valencia owns an &quot;Equestrian Portrait of Don Francisco de Moncada&quot; (currently undergoing restoration, April 2020).

Tate Britain held the exhibition &quot;Van Dyck &amp; Britain&quot; in 2009. In 2016 the Frick Collection in New York had an exhibition &quot;Van Dyck: The Anatomy of Portraiture&quot;, the first major survey of the artist&#x27;s work in the United States in over two decades.

The estate of the Earl Spencer at Althorp houses a small collection of van Dycks including &quot;War and Peace&quot; (Portrait of Sir George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol, English Royalist politician with William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford), which is the most valuable painting in the collection and the favourite of the earl.

<text>A school zone refers to an area on a street near a school or near a crosswalk leading to a school that has a likely presence of younger pedestrians. School zones generally have a reduced speed limit during certain hours.

==Fines==

Fines for speeding in school zones may be enhanced. For example, many authorities double speeding fines in school zones.
In New South Wales, Australia there are increases in fines that apply in school zones, during school zone times. The most common offences that occur in a school zone also attract demerit points. This includes most parking offences, such as parking on a footpath or nature strip, double parking, disobeying a no stopping or no parking sign and stopping in a bus zone. In the United Kingdom the fine for stopping next to a school is £30.

==When active==
School zone speed limits are often, but not always, only applicable during posted weekday hours near the beginning and end of the school day, when children are likely to cross roads. In some jurisdictions, the school zone speed limit is effective at all times when school is in session, plus additional time before and after the school day. Flashing amber lights often indicate when the school zone is effective. When a school zone also has a large playground facility, it may double as a playground zone and the speed limit could be in effect longer — or even continuous.

In California, school zones are generally in effect only &quot;when children are outside or crossing the street&quot;, and usually have a speed limit of 25 mph, or 40 km/h. School zone signs are sometimes amended with the notice &quot;When children are present&quot; (as shown on the photo), which emphasizes its definition in the drivers&#x27; handbook.

School zones may also sometimes be in effect during school holidays, due to holiday programs that use school premises. In some locations, however, school zone signs will be locked up during school holidays so that motorists can drive to the normal speed limit.

School zones typically have speed limits between 15 and 25 mph (25 and 40 km/h).

Overtaking moving or stationary vehicles in active school zones is prohibited in some jurisdictions.

==Effectiveness==

In a review of the available research, the Committee for Guidance on Setting and Enforcing Speed Limits of the Transportation Research Board, part of the United States National Research Council, stated:
In the Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering it was concluded that &quot;the results of this study provide strong evidence that reducing speed limits to 30 km/h in school zones can bring significant safety benefits by reducing vehicular speeds and fatal and injury crashes.&quot;

Despite this there has been no conclusive figures on the effectiveness of school zones.

<doc id="294472" wikidata="Q1196348" url="?curid=294472" title="Smith Tower">
<text>Smith Tower is a skyscraper in the Pioneer Square neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. Completed in 1914, the 38-story, tower was among the tallest skyscrapers outside New York City at the time of its completion. It was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River until the completion of the Kansas City Power &amp; Light Building in 1931. It remained the tallest building on the U.S. West Coast for nearly half a century, until the Space Needle overtook it in 1962.

The tower is named after its builder, the firearm and typewriter magnate Lyman Cornelius Smith (unrelated to Horace Smith of Smith &amp; Wesson), but its construction was largely overseen by his son Burns Lyman Smith after his father&#x27;s 1910 death and would remain under the ownership of the Smith family into the 1940s. It was originally known as the L.C. Smith Building until the Smith Tower became its official name in 1929. It was designated as a Seattle landmark in 1984.

==History==

===Conception and design===
In the wake of the Klondike Gold Rush, Eastern financial interest in Seattle was at an all-time high. Prominent local attorney James Clise, who represented numerous capitalists in New York and Boston was responsible for many of the land transactions that saw numerous new office buildings built in the city. Among his largest clients at the turn of the century was Syracuse, New York millionaire industrialist Lyman Cornelius Smith and his brother Wilbert Lewis Smith who, through Clise, purchased and developed numerous buildings in Seattle&#x27;s Pioneer Square district. L.C. was soon the city&#x27;s biggest taxpayer and the largest individual owner of Seattle real estate in the country. Among those properties was the odd-shaped lot at the Northeast corner of Yesler Way and Second Avenue, then known as the Wirth Corner (or Bailey Corner) which L.C. purchased in May 1899 from William E. Bailey (Builder of the nearby Broderick Building), who had built a 1-story brick building on the lot following the Great Seattle Fire with intentions of building something more substantial before the Panic of 1893 struck. Smith, who saw great potential in the site, made no immediate plans to build, but would visit Seattle to inspect the property.

During a trip to Seattle in 1909, Smith began planning a 14-story building for the Bailey Corner. After consulting with Clise about what kind of building Seattle&#x27;s economy would bear, his son, Burns Lyman Smith, convinced him to build instead a much taller skyscraper to steal the crown from rival city Tacoma&#x27;s National Realty Building as the tallest west of the Mississippi River. Smith chose the Syracuse architectural firm of Gaggin and Gaggin to design his tower and in February 1910, Edwin H. Gaggin arrived in Seattle with blueprints in hand and an official announcement for a 26-story building that would be the highest west of the Mississippi. With construction proposed to begin in June 1910, instead came the announcement that month that Smith would be willing to build to an unheard of 40-floors (35-story base, 5-story tower) on the condition that Seattle&#x27;s city hall and civic center not be moved uptown from their property at 3rd Avenue and Yesler Way on the adjoining block. With the passage of a bond to purchase the city hall site and assurance from mayor Hiram C. Gill and the city council, the proposed Smith Tower would be the third tallest office building in the world behind only the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower and Singer Building in New York City.

With L.C.&#x27;s health declining and other business interests in New York requiring his attention, he put construction of the $1,000,000 building in the hands of B.L. Smith and E.H. Gaggin, who returned to Seattle in October 1910 with the final plans for a , 42-story building that would incorporate all the modern features of the Metropolitan Life and Singer Buildings; at his son&#x27;s suggestion, the building would have a 22-story base and a 20-story tower. With a steel-frame and concrete structure, the building would be clad in granite at the base, and the rest in gleaming white terra cotta that would, according to local media, &quot;cast the rays of the sun in a blaze that should be seen 15 or 20 miles&quot;. The building would be equipped with eight high-speed elevators that could carry an estimated 22,000 passengers per day. A heating plant would be built in the basement as well as a water cooler to supply drinking water to all the tenants, that would be fed by a 12,000 gallon tank in the pyramid roof of the tower. The first building permit was issued on October 20, 1910, but the elder Smith died the following month and never saw his building break ground. The original permit, however, was delayed by concerns from the city about the ground soil conditions of the site and the use of wired safety glass on the windows, among other things. Because the building already exceeded the city&#x27;s existing building codes, excessive reviews and negotiations were required before the building could get final approval. All was settled by February 1911 when the final building permit was issued on the 24th.

After settling the final details of the building with the Smith Estate that had been left in limbo after L.C.&#x27;s death and putting to rest the public&#x27;s doubt that it would even be built, bids for construction were opened at Gaggin &amp; Gaggin&#x27;s Syracuse, New York office to contractors across the country on May 10, 1911. Over 160 bids were submitted; 56 firms placed bids on the general construction contract alone and it would take the Smith heirs nearly two months to review them all. While bids were being prepared, tenants of the old Wirth Corner building were served notices to vacate the building by June 1 to prepare for its demolition. To celebrate the beginning of construction of the Smith Tower as well as the Lake Washington Ship Canal, Hoge Building and other major projects underway around Seattle, the city declared June 1 Progress and Prosperity Day and threw a parade to visit all these sites attended by delegations from all over Puget Sound. At the Smith Tower site a single brick was removed from the old building to ceremonially mark the beginning of construction, though actual demolition work wouldn&#x27;t begin for several weeks. Although the winning contractors were chosen and notified by the end of June, the signing of contracts and beginning of construction now relied on the final settlement of L.C. Smith&#x27;s estate, which would deed the Smith Tower site to his son Burns Lyman Smith by the end of August.

===Construction and opening===

On September 5, 1911, the first contracts for general construction and excavation were signed by the New York-based Whitney-Steen Company, who had recently constructed the Daniels &amp; Fisher Tower in Denver, Colorado and had several international projects under their belts. They would in turn contract the American Bridge Company to provide and assemble the nearly 5,000 tons of steel from their own foundry at Ambridge, Pennsylvania that would be required to build the Smith Tower&#x27;s frame. Several local firms were awarded early contracts including Charles W. Rodgers (tiling), the Rautman Plumbing &amp; Heating Company and the Agutter-Griswold Company for the electric wiring. The Harper-Hill Company run by T.S. Lippy, who operated a brick plant near Southworth at Harper that had previously supplied bricks for the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and the Moore Theatre, won the contract for supplying the common brick that would insulate the building&#x27;s walls. Representatives from the Whitney-Steen Company arrived in Seattle in late October and set up their construction office on the 6th floor of the Smith-owned Pacific Block (which would later be known as the Smith Tower Annex). They would soon be joined by H.W. Thompson, also of Syracuse, who would act as supervising architect. Most tenants vacated the old building by October 1 but many more insisted on remaining until the last possible moment and arrangements were made to excavate around them until the structural steel and other needed equipment was scheduled to arrive in February 1912 at which time construction would go into full swing. Selective demolition began on November 1, officially marking the start of construction.

Excavation continued day and night throughout November and December 1911, only being stopped when the derrick used for removing spoils collapsed, narrowly missing several workers. As the deep foundation was being dug and retaining walls built, rigorous geological tests of the ground soil were being undertaken by supervising architect Thompson. Several holes were bored into the ground to a depth of , well below the proposed footing and core samples were examined. A test box weighing 80 tons was constructed on equally placed pilings on the center of the property to monitor ground settling and test the weight capacity of the soil. Smith and Gaggin returned to Seattle in January 1912, where they would stay for several months to personally oversee construction of the building&#x27;s base floors. Smith would bring with him to Seattle a oil painting of the building, used for advertising literature, where it would stand on display in a nearby business. In an unparalleled advertising campaign, images of the Smith Tower would be displayed in every L.C. Smith Company office and published nationwide to promote Seattle as an up and coming metropolis. Postcards were published of the yet to be completed building and sent across the world.

From April to May 1912 while excavation of the foundation and retaining walls was wrapping up and while the contractors were still awaiting the delivery of the steel beams from Pennsylvania, further contracts were signed for building materials from local and national firms. Granite for the building&#x27;s base floors would come from A.D. Gunn&#x27;s quarry at Index, Washington and a further 1.5 million bricks were ordered from the Builders&#x27; Brick Company. One of the largest electrical contracts ever let outside of New York City was awarded to Nepage, McKenny &amp; Co., who would install 18.5 miles of conduit and of light, power and telegraph cables throughout the building&#x27;s 42 floors. Concrete pilings, the style and strength of which were determined based on the results of the geological tests, would be manufactured and driven by the Raymond Concrete Piling Company of New York. All marble work would be handled by the Vermont Marble Company of Proctor, Vermont and Mexican onyx used in the lobby would be provided by the New Pedrara Mexican Onyx Company of San Diego, California. Most metal work including wrought iron railings, bronze fixtures and the fireproof metal windows would be provided and installed by firms from New York and Chicago. The final contracts, for plastering and fireproofing, were awarded to Denver and Fargo firms, respectively, on July 8, 1912.

By late July the first 40 carloads of steel for the tower&#x27;s frame had arrived in the city, removing any lingering doubts of the project&#x27;s reality among locals. The last of the 1,276 pilings were driven and the brick-lined reinforced concrete foundation was complete by the beginning of August and the steel frame began to rise rapidly out of the pit. The top of the first floor was reached by October as 140 more carloads of steel arrived. The first reported work-site injury occurred on October 15 when laborer J.O. Charest&#x27;s foot was crushed by an iron girder and was later amputated. B.L. Smith returned to Seattle several days later with a group of New York businessmen to give an impromptu tour of the local banks and landmarks, including Seattle&#x27;s then tallest building, the Hoge Building from whose roof they viewed the Smith Tower&#x27;s construction site.

The building&#x27;s steel frame took shape very quickly, with the final rivet being driven on the top of the 42nd floor on February 15, 1913. &quot;Seattle Times&quot; photographer Will T. Curtis scaled the building, which still lacked stairways above the 16th floor, to capture the event. One of the biggest incidents to happen during the building&#x27;s construction occurred on the morning of February 20 when a wooden derrick weighing 3 tons fell from the 34th floor as it was being lowered, crashing through the roof of the building&#x27;s base and piercing 13 floors. Miraculously there was not a single injury and damage was limited to repairing the holes in the concrete flooring. Construction proceeded without delay and steelwork was completed the very next day, marked by the raising of the American flag from the highest point by the superintendent and several of his men, who after a photoshoot featuring various daredevil poses around the flagpole, accidentally dropped their camera off the building, destroying it and the film. Concrete work and fireproofing were completed during the summer and the glistening terracotta façade began to rise over the steel frame. Before a completion date was in sight and the steel frame was even complete superintendent Thompson was bombarded by companies jockeying to rent entire floors in the building; 540 offices would be available in the main building with 13 suites in the tower, one per floor.

Although L.C. Smith did not live to see construction begin, his namesake building was completed in 1914 to a height of from curbside to the top of the pyramid, with a pinnacle height of . Smith Tower opened to the public on July 4, 1914. Over 4,000 Seattleites rode to the 35th floor on opening day. The Chinese Room, whose name was retired following the 2016 renovation, derived from the carved teak ceiling and blackwood furniture that adorned the room on opening. The room was furnished by the last Empress of China, Cixi. Furnishings include the famous Wishing Chair. The chair incorporates a carved dragon and a phoenix, which, when combined, portends marriage. According to folklore, any wishful unmarried person who sits in it would be married within a year. The legend came true for Smith&#x27;s daughter, who married in the Chinese Room itself.

===Sales and renovations===

Ivar Haglund of Ivar&#x27;s restaurant fame bought the tower for $1.8 million in 1976. The building has been renovated twice, in 1986 and in 1999. The government of King County considered purchasing the Smith Tower in 1996 for $7.5 million; they were a major tenant with , which represented half of the leasable office space, and sought to consolidate space around the historic King County Courthouse. The county government decided against using an option to buy the building from GE Capital. The Samis Foundation, a major downtown landowner, acquired the tower after the county government backed out. In 2006, the building was purchased by Walton Street Capital.

The burst of the dot-com bubble hurt Smith Tower by raising its vacancy rate to 26.1 percent, twice Seattle&#x27;s commercial vacancy rate, as of December 21, 2001. The Walt Disney Internet Group, for example, at the time reduced its seven floors to four. By 2007, the occupancy rate had rebounded to about 90 percent, with new occupants such as Microsoft Live Labs.

Following the announced departure of the building&#x27;s two largest occupants that included Disney, which moved to the Fourth and Madison Building, Walton Street Capital filed an unsuccessful application to convert the building into condominiums.

In 2011, CBRE Group reported that it had purchased a 2006 $42.5 million mortgage in default on the Smith Tower. The loan recipient was building owner Walton Street. When CBRE stepped in, the building was 70 percent vacant, its rental income was not covering its operating expenses, and its value was assessed by the county to be less than half of its 2006 mortgage. Smith Tower was sold to CBRE at a public foreclosure auction on March 23, 2012.

In the spring of 2012 Smith Tower experienced a brief revitalization in the form of new companies moving into some of its empty floors including Portent, Inc., Aukema &amp; Associates, Push Design, and Rialto Communications.

In January 2015, Seattle-based real estate investment and operating company Unico Properties bought Smith Tower for $73.7 million. Later that year, the new owners stopped the visitor tour and began remodeling the public areas, including the Chinese Room, which had been closed since 2014. A new speakeasy-themed restaurant, with Prohibition era-inspired food and drink was built on the observatory floor, in the same space as the Chinese Room, which was permanently closed. Parts of the Chinese Room decor and furniture, such as the Wishing Chair and carved teak ceilings, were used in this new restaurant.

A revised Smith Tower self-guided visitor tour, with new exhibits, resumed on August 25, 2016, along with the opening of the observation floor bar, open to tour ticket holders at a cost of $19.14 — the price being a reference to the date of the building. A discount is offered with a Washington State driver&#x27;s license. Access to the bar without paying for the tour requires a cover charge of about half that price. A new retail store on the ground floor was also opened following the renovation. The building was sold to Goldman Sachs in October 2018 as part of a $750 million package of Unico properties in Seattle and Denver.

The building was put up for sale in 2023 and sold in August 2024 to GT Capital, investment firms, and several unnamed &quot;prominent Seattle families&quot;.

==Description==

Smith Tower is an example of neoclassical architecture. Its outer skin is granite on the first and second floors, and terracotta on the rest. The exterior has been washed only once in 1976.

The building was one of the last on the West Coast to employ elevator operators. The Otis Elevator Company provided the elevators, which have brass surfaces. The original doors were latticed scissor gates, so a rider could see into each hallway and through the glass walls in front of each office. The elevators were automated and modernized beginning in 2017, for faster service time and seismic safety, with new glass doors still allowing riders a view into the hallways and lobbies.

After the restoration in the early 1990s, workers removed the water tank in the top of the tower. The resulting space along with a former maintenance man&#x27;s apartment became a three-story penthouse, the only residence in the building. It was occupied in 2010 by a family of four. The penthouse apartment was listed on public markets in 2021 for $17,000 per month.

The building is crowned by an glass dome illuminated by blue light, except during December when it is changed to green.

==In popular culture==
In 2012, Death Cab for Cutie frontman Benjamin Gibbard paid tribute to the Smith Tower in the song &quot;Teardrop Windows&quot;.

<text>Witchblade is an American comic book series published by Top Cow Productions, an imprint of Image Comics, which ran from November 1995 to October 2015. The series was created by Top Cow founder and owner Marc Silvestri, editor David Wohl, writers Brian Haberlin and Christina Z, and artist Michael Turner.

The &quot;Witchblade&quot; comic was adapted into a television series in 2001, as well as an anime, a manga and a novel in 2006. A feature film based on the comic, titled &quot;The Witchblade&quot;, was announced for a 2009 release, but was never produced. A second &quot;Witchblade&quot; television series was announced for development in January 2017, but no further updates have been reported.

Top Cow relaunched &quot;Witchblade&quot; comic in December 2017 with the creative team of writer Caitlin Kittredge and artist Roberta Ingranata. The series features journalist Alex Underwood as the main character.

The first of a new &quot;Witchblade&quot; comic series was released in July 2024 featuring a new &quot;Witchblade&quot; creative team: writer Marguerite Bennett, artist Giuseppe Cafaro, colorist Arif Prianto and letterer Troy Peteri.

==Plot summary==
The series follows Sara Pezzini, an NYPD homicide detective who comes into possession of the Witchblade, a supernatural, sentient gauntlet that bonds with a female host and provides her with a variety of powers in order to fight supernatural evil. Sara struggles to hone the powers of the Witchblade and fend off those with a nefarious interest in it, such as entrepreneur Kenneth Irons and his bodyguard Ian Nottingham.

==Characters==
===The Witchblade===
The Witchblade is a sentient gauntlet; described as being the offspring of the Darkness and Angelus and serving as the balance between the two forces. Often described as being a male entity, though occasionally taking a feminine form whenever it manifests itself, the Witchblade symbiotically bonds itself to humans—typically women—to serve as its bearers.

===Sara Pezzini===
A New York City detective, Sara first encountered the Witchblade while on a case with her then partner, Michael Yee. After both officers were mortally wounded by criminal Ian Nottingham, the gauntlet suddenly left the possession of his employer, Kenneth Irons, and gave its power to Sara, healing her wounds. When Jackie Estacado, the host of the Darkness, was possessed by its influence, he impregnated a temporarily comatose Sara as part of an effort to sway the Witchblade&#x27;s balance. However, neither of them became aware of this until later. Eventually, Sara met and relinquished the Witchblade to Danielle Baptiste, to whom the artifact had a strong affinity. Amidst complications during the birth of her daughter, Hope, Sara&#x27;s life was saved when she received half of the Witchblade from Dani. Sara now possesses the full Witchblade and Dani is now the host for the Angelus.

===Danielle Baptiste===
Danielle is a young ballet dancer who was born in New Orleans. After moving to New York to pursue her career, she experienced a mysterious dream in which she saw herself inheriting great power by means of a mystical gauntlet. Dani found herself taking a walk and wandering to an antique shop the next day. It was there that she encountered Sara Pezzini, the current host of the Witchblade. Having become pregnant, Sara realized that the time had come for her to relinquish the artifact. Sara relinquished the Witchblade to Dani when she realized that she was meant to become its next host. While exploring her powers, Dani faced and overcame a number of mystical opponents. Eventually, Dani returned half of the Witchblade to Sara in order to save Sara&#x27;s life following the birth of her child. She currently does not have any portion of the Witchblade as she is the present host to the Angelus.

===Patrick Gleason===
An NYPD detective, Sara&#x27;s partner and boyfriend. Following Hope&#x27;s birth, he serves as the baby&#x27;s surrogate father and Sara&#x27;s confidant in issues involving the Witchblade.

===The Curator/The Survivor===
The owner of an antiques shop, the Curator is a sage-like spectator, occasional informant, and the second primary antagonist of the series. One of Sara and Dani&#x27;s most trusted confidants, he knows much about the various Artifacts. The Curator later dies, spontaneously exploding after saying &quot;all hope is lost&quot;. It was later revealed that the Curator was actually the Survivor, the mysterious mastermind behind all of the recent events in Sara&#x27;s life. He is the sole survivor of the previous universe in which he was the &quot;Codex&quot;, a being meant to ensure its survival in the event of Armageddon. Having failed in his duty and witnessed the destruction of his family, the Survivor has been gradually gathering and manipulating the Artifacts and their bearers throughout history as part of his plan to resurrect his universe.

===Tau&#x27;ma===
The Curator&#x27;s brother, Tau&#x27;ma has sided with the Darkness and can pull Darklings from out of his head to attack or spy on others. He also wields a powerful cane with a gem-encrusted hawk head.

===Hope Pezzini===
Sara&#x27;s daughter with Jackie Estacado. She is neither of the Darkness nor the Angelus, but has unknown powers that are dormant. Hope is the subject of a search by several Artifact bearers following her capture by the Survivor. Hope is the &quot;Codex&quot; for the entire universe, meant to survive and ensure its survival. The Survivor planned to kill Hope and replace her as the Codex in order to guarantee the resurrection of his own universe.

===Julie Pezzini===
Sara&#x27;s sister. She was romantically involved with Jake, but the two broke up when Jake discovered that she was running drugs. Jake later returned and shot Julie, but she survived, leading to her arrest and imprisonment. Julie was later released after serving her sentence and was reunited with Sara. While taking Hope to a fair, Julie was surprised by Aphrodite IV, who killed her after shooting her in the head.

===Ian Nottingham===
Formerly a Captain of the British Special Air Service, Ian subsequently joined MI5. He underwent behavioural modifications for the purpose of infiltrating the Yakuza. Afterwards, he forgot his past and became Kenneth Irons&#x27; bodyguard. Ian has phenomenal skill with both ancient and modern weapons. Ian kills Sara&#x27;s partner, Michael Yee. For a time he underwent a great change, allowing him the capability to absorb great quantities of energy and to drain energy from entities, even going so far as to temporarily host both the Witchblade and the Darkness. He also temporarily wielded Excalibur, the Witchblade&#x27;s twin, but it was revealed that Excalibur was merely a shard of the Witchblade, which quickly reabsorbed it. After he lost Excalibur and was defeated by Sara, Ian was taken to prison, only to be freed later by Aphrodite IV. He then retrieved the Blood Sword from Michael Finnegan, gravely wounding the wielder of the Glacier Stone in the process, and left him in the river to die.

===Kenneth Irons===
The first main antagonist of the series, Kenneth Irons is a wealthy entrepreneur who discovered the Witchblade in Greece. Irons&#x27; age is unknown. It was eventually revealed that he was a Templar Knight of the Third Crusade and that he once drank from the Holy Grail, granting him a healing factor and immortality, establishing his age as greater than 800 years. However, due to his exposure to the Witchblade during an attempt to host it, Irons does not age at a normal rate; he appears to be no older than 35. In a failed bid to gain control of the Witchblade, Irons lost his hand and sacrificed his wife. Later he was one of two characters left in the Deathpool. As a result, Chief Joe Siry killed Irons for all of the trouble that he had unleashed on Sara. Kenneth is the father of Geraud Irons.

===Joe Siry===
Sara&#x27;s former captain when she served at the 18th Precinct. He was the partner of Sara&#x27;s dead father, Detective Vincent Pezzini.

===Jake McCarthy===
An NYPD detective, Jake was Sara&#x27;s best friend and former partner. He fell in love with Sara, but his feelings were unrequited. A demon came to Earth and entered Jake&#x27;s body, possessing him while he was wounded defending a weakened Sara. While in a coma he was placed in a hospital. When he woke up later, the god-like demon took full control of his body. The demon was bent on destroying the world to remake it into a hellish kingdom with him as ruler. Sara eventually drove the demon&#x27;s influence out of Jake&#x27;s mind, but Jake, still possessed by the demon, committed suicide to ensure that the demon could never control his body again.

==In other media==
===Television===
====TNT series====

Following a pilot film in August 2000, TNT premiered a television series based on the comic book series which ran for two seasons from June 12, 2001 to August 26, 2002. The series was directed by Ralph Hemecker, written by Marc Silvestri and J.D. Zeik, and starred Yancy Butler as Sara Pezzini. Although critically acclaimed and popular with audiences, the series was canceled in September 2002, reportedly due to Butler’s issues with substance abuse. Warner Home Video released &quot;Witchblade: The Complete Series&quot;—a seven-disc collector&#x27;s set including the original made-for-TV movie, all 23 episodes of the series, and special features—on DVD on July 29, 2008.

===Music===
Witchblade the Music is a compilation album of music from/inspired by the Witchblade TV series and the comic book. The songs included on this album are performed by Various Artists. It was compiled and produced by G Tom Mac, it was conceived by Christina Z and released in 2004 on the Edge Artists record label. The album notes credit G Tom Mac a.k.a. Gerard McMahon for the music and Eddie Kislinger for the lyrics for &quot;Wicked Town&quot;, &quot;Drop Dead Pretty&quot;, and &quot;Was It Magic”. McMahon is also credited for &quot;Greater Powers&quot;; &quot;Child of Mine&quot; with Roger Daltrey; and &quot;Cry Little Sister&quot; which he wrote with Michael Maineri. In addition, McMahon and Kislinger are credited as the Executive Producers of the soundtrack.

====NBC series====
In January 2017, NBC announced the development a &quot;Witchblade&quot; television series, with Carol Mendelsohn and Caroline Dries serving as executive producers.

===Anime series===

Top Cow and Japanese animation studio Gonzo produced an anime adaptation of &quot;Witchblade&quot;, which began broadcast during April 2006 and ran for 24 episodes. Although the anime features a new story with all new characters, it exists in the same continuity as the comic book and manga. The anime focuses on Masane Amaha, who has no recollection of her past beyond six years earlier.

===Manga===
In August 2004, Top Cow made an agreement with manga publisher Kodansha to produce a manga adaptation of &quot;Witchblade&quot;. The subsequent adaptation, , was released in March 2006, written by the anime&#x27;s main writer Yasuko Kobayashi (小林靖子) and drawn by . The manga features a different plot and characters from the &quot;Witchblade&quot; anime and comic book but is set in the same continuity as both. The manga focuses on Takeru Ibaraki, an average Japanese high school girl raised in a Buddhist convent who experiences recurring nightmares about the Witchblade and eventually becomes its newest bearer. The manga was released in the U.S. by Top Cow and Bandai Entertainment from February 2007 to February 2008.

===Japanese novel===
 is a Japanese novel written by Satoshi Ichikawa (市川智士) with art and illustrations by Makoto Uno (うのまこと), who previously worked on the &quot;Witchblade&quot; anime as the lead art and character designer. It was published in August 2006. The protagonist is Yuri Miyazono, a sickly 15-year-old Okinawan girl who bonds with the Witchblade for her own survival. The novel is set the same continuity as the &quot;Witchblade&quot; anime and manga, with Yuri as the immediate successor of Takeru Ibaraki from &quot;Witchblade Takeru&quot; and the immediate predecessor of Masane Amaha from the &quot;Witchblade&quot; anime.

===Cancelled film and untitled video game adaptation===
A feature film adaptation of the comic was announced in 2008 and scheduled for a 2009 release, but was never produced. The film was to have been produced by Platinum Studios, Top Cow Productions, and Arclight Media, with Top Cow&#x27;s Matt Hawkins &amp; Marc Silvestri, Platinum&#x27;s Rich Marincic, and Greenberg Group&#x27;s Randy Greenberg serving as executive producers. Production was planned for September 2008, with filming to be done in Australia. A video game was announced but was later scrapped.

<doc id="294474" wikidata="Q1529941" url="?curid=294474" title="Peter–Weyl theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Peter–Weyl theorem is a basic result in the theory of harmonic analysis, applying to topological groups that are compact, but are not necessarily abelian. It was initially proved by Hermann Weyl, with his student Fritz Peter, in the setting of a compact topological group &quot;G&quot; . The theorem is a collection of results generalizing the significant facts about the decomposition of the regular representation of any finite group, as discovered by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius and Issai Schur.

Let &quot;G&quot; be a compact group. The theorem has three parts. The first part states that the matrix coefficients of irreducible representations of &quot;G&quot; are dense in the space &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of continuous complex-valued functions on &quot;G&quot;, and thus also in the space &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;) of square-integrable functions. The second part asserts the complete reducibility of unitary representations of &quot;G&quot;. The third part then asserts that the regular representation of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;) decomposes as the direct sum of all irreducible unitary representations. Moreover, the matrix coefficients of the irreducible unitary representations form an orthonormal basis of &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;). In the case that &quot;G&quot; is the group of unit complex numbers, this last result is simply a standard result from Fourier series.

==Matrix coefficients==
A matrix coefficient of the group &quot;G&quot; is a complex-valued function formula_1 on &quot;G&quot; given as the composition

:formula_2

where π : &quot;G&quot; → GL(&quot;V&quot;) is a finite-dimensional (continuous) group representation of &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;L&quot; is a linear functional on the vector space of endomorphisms of &quot;V&quot; (e.g. trace), which contains GL(&quot;V&quot;) as an open subset. Matrix coefficients are continuous, since representations are by definition continuous, and linear functionals on finite-dimensional spaces are also continuous.

The first part of the Peter–Weyl theorem asserts (; ):

Peter–Weyl Theorem (Part I). The set of matrix coefficients of &quot;G&quot; is dense in the space of continuous complex functions C(&quot;G&quot;) on &quot;G&quot;, equipped with the uniform norm.

This first result resembles the Stone–Weierstrass theorem in that it indicates the density of a set of functions in the space of all continuous functions, subject only to an &quot;algebraic&quot; characterization. In fact, the matrix coefficients form a unital algebra invariant under complex conjugation because the product of two matrix coefficients is a matrix coefficient of the tensor product representation, and the complex conjugate is a matrix coefficient of the dual representation. Hence the theorem follows directly from the Stone–Weierstrass theorem if the matrix coefficients separate points, which is obvious if &quot;G&quot; is a matrix group . Conversely, it is a consequence of the theorem that any compact Lie group is isomorphic to a matrix group .

A corollary of this result is that the matrix coefficients of &quot;G&quot; are dense in &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;).

==Decomposition of a unitary representation==
The second part of the theorem gives the existence of a decomposition of a unitary representation of &quot;G&quot; into finite-dimensional representations. Now, intuitively groups were conceived as rotations on geometric objects, so it is only natural to study representations which essentially arise from continuous actions on Hilbert spaces. (For those who were first introduced to dual groups consisting of characters which are the continuous homomorphisms into the circle group, this approach is similar except that the circle group is (ultimately) generalised to the group of unitary operators on a given Hilbert space.)

Let &quot;G&quot; be a topological group and &quot;H&quot; a complex Hilbert space.

A continuous linear action ∗ : &quot;G&quot; × &quot;H&quot; → &quot;H&quot;, gives rise to a continuous map ρ∗ : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot;&quot;H&quot; (functions from &quot;H&quot; to &quot;H&quot; with the strong topology) defined by: ρ∗(&quot;g&quot;)(&quot;v&quot;) = &quot;∗(g,v)&quot;. This map is clearly a homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; into GL(&quot;H&quot;), the bounded linear operators on &quot;H&quot;. Conversely, given such a map, we can uniquely recover the action in the obvious way.

Thus we define the representations of &quot;G&quot; on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; to be those group homomorphisms, ρ, which arise from continuous actions of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;H&quot;. We say that a representation ρ is unitary if ρ(&quot;g&quot;) is a unitary operator for all &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;; i.e., formula_3 for all &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot;. (I.e. it is unitary if ρ : &quot;G&quot; → U(&quot;H&quot;). Notice how this generalises the special case of the one-dimensional Hilbert space, where U(C) is just the circle group.)

Given these definitions, we can state the second part of the Peter–Weyl theorem :

Peter–Weyl Theorem (Part II). Let ρ be a unitary representation of a compact group &quot;G&quot; on a complex Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;. Then &quot;H&quot; splits into an orthogonal direct sum of irreducible finite-dimensional unitary representations of &quot;G&quot;.

==Decomposition of square-integrable functions==
To state the third and final part of the theorem, there is a natural Hilbert space over &quot;G&quot; consisting of square-integrable functions, formula_4; this makes sense because the Haar measure exists on &quot;G&quot;. The group &quot;G&quot; has a unitary representation ρ on formula_4 given by acting on the left, via

:formula_6

The final statement of the Peter–Weyl theorem gives an explicit orthonormal basis of formula_4. Roughly it asserts that the matrix coefficients for &quot;G&quot;, suitably renormalized, are an orthonormal basis of &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;). In particular, formula_4 decomposes into an orthogonal direct sum of all the irreducible unitary representations, in which the multiplicity of each irreducible representation is equal to its degree (that is, the dimension of the underlying space of the representation). Thus,

:formula_9

where Σ denotes the set of (isomorphism classes of) irreducible unitary representations of &quot;G&quot;, and the summation denotes the closure of the direct sum of the total spaces &quot;E&quot;π of the representations π.

We may also regard formula_4 as a representation of the direct product group formula_11, with the two factors acting by translation on the left and the right, respectively. Fix a representation formula_12 of formula_13. The space of matrix coefficients for the representation may be identified with formula_14, the space of linear maps of formula_15 to itself. The natural left and right action of formula_11 on the matrix coefficients corresponds to the action on formula_14 given by
:formula_18
Then we may decompose formula_4 as unitary representation of formula_11 in the form

:formula_21

Finally, we may form an orthonormal basis for formula_4 as follows. Suppose that a representative π is chosen for each isomorphism class of irreducible unitary representation, and denote the collection of all such π by Σ. Let formula_23 be the matrix coefficients of π in an orthonormal basis, in other words

:formula_24

for each &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;. Finally, let &quot;d&quot;(π) be the degree of the representation π. The theorem now asserts that the set of functions

:formula_25

is an orthonormal basis of formula_26

===Restriction to class functions===
A function formula_27 on &quot;G&quot; is called a &quot;class function&quot; if formula_28 for all formula_29 and formula_30 in &quot;G&quot;. The space of square-integrable class functions forms a closed subspace of formula_4, and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right. Within the space of matrix coefficients for a fixed representation formula_32 is the character formula_33 of formula_32, defined by
:formula_35
In the notation above, the character is the sum of the diagonal matrix coefficients:
:formula_36
An important consequence of the preceding result is the following:
:Theorem: The characters of the irreducible representations of &quot;G&quot; form a Hilbert basis for the space of square-integrable class functions on &quot;G&quot;.
This result plays an important part in Weyl&#x27;s classification of the representations of a connected compact Lie group.

===An example: U(1)===
A simple but helpful example is the case of the group of complex numbers of magnitude 1, formula_37. In this case, the irreducible representations are one-dimensional and given by
:formula_38
There is then a single matrix coefficient for each representation, the function
:formula_39
The last part of the Peter–Weyl theorem then asserts in this case that these functions form an orthonormal basis for formula_40. In this case, the theorem is simply a standard result from the theory of Fourier series.

For any compact group &quot;G&quot;, we can regard the decomposition of formula_4 in terms of matrix coefficients as a generalization of the theory of Fourier series. Indeed, this decomposition is often referred to as a Fourier series.

===An example: SU(2)===
We use the standard representation of the group SU(2) as
:formula_42
Thus, SU(2) is represented as the 3-sphere formula_43 sitting inside formula_44.
The irreducible representations of SU(2), meanwhile, are labeled by a non-negative integer formula_45 and can be realized as the natural action of SU(2) on the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree formula_45 in two complex variables. The matrix coefficients of the formula_45th representation are hyperspherical harmonics of degree formula_45, that is, the restrictions to formula_43 of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree formula_45 in formula_51 and formula_52. The key to verifying this claim is to compute that for any two complex numbers formula_53 and formula_54, the function 
:formula_55 
is harmonic as a function of formula_56.

In this case, finding an orthonormal basis for formula_57 consisting of matrix coefficients amounts to finding an orthonormal basis consisting of hyperspherical harmonics, which is a standard construction in analysis on spheres.

==Consequences==
===Representation theory of connected compact Lie groups===
The Peter–Weyl theorem—specifically the assertion that the characters form an orthonormal &quot;basis&quot; for the space of square-integrable class functions—plays a key role in the classification of the irreducible representations of a connected compact Lie group. The argument also depends on the Weyl integral formula (for class functions) and the Weyl character formula.

An outline of the argument may be found here.

===Linearity of compact Lie groups===
One important consequence of the Peter–Weyl theorem is the following:
:Theorem: Every compact Lie group has a faithful finite-dimensional representation and is therefore isomorphic to a closed subgroup of formula_58 for some formula_59.

===Structure of compact topological groups===
From the Peter–Weyl theorem, one can deduce a significant general structure theorem. Let &quot;G&quot; be a compact topological group, which we assume Hausdorff. For any finite-dimensional &quot;G&quot;-invariant subspace &quot;V&quot; in &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;), where &quot;G&quot; acts on the left, we consider the image of &quot;G&quot; in GL(&quot;V&quot;). It is closed, since &quot;G&quot; is compact, and a subgroup of the Lie group GL(&quot;V&quot;). It follows by a theorem of Élie Cartan that the image of &quot;G&quot; is a Lie group also.

If we now take the limit (in the sense of category theory) over all such spaces &quot;V&quot;, we get a result about &quot;G&quot;: Because &quot;G&quot; acts faithfully on &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;), &quot;G&quot; is an &quot;inverse limit of Lie groups&quot;. It may of course not itself be a Lie group: it may for example be a profinite group.

<doc id="294481" wikidata="Q503106" url="?curid=294481" title="Josei manga">
<text>, also known as and its abbreviation , is an editorial category of Japanese comics that emerged in the 1980s. In a strict sense, &quot;josei&quot; refers to manga marketed to an audience of adult women, contrasting &quot;shōjo&quot; manga, which is marketed to an audience of girls and young adult women. In practice, the distinction between &quot;shōjo&quot; and &quot;josei&quot; is often tenuous; while the two were initially divergent categories, many manga works exhibit narrative and stylistic traits associated with both &quot;shōjo&quot; and &quot;josei&quot; manga. This distinction is further complicated by a third manga editorial category, , which emerged in the late 1980s as an intermediate category between &quot;shōjo&quot; and &quot;josei&quot;.

&quot;Josei&quot; manga is traditionally printed in dedicated manga magazines which often specialize in a specific subgenre, typically drama, romance, or pornography. While &quot;josei&quot; dramas are, in most cases, realist stories about the lives of ordinary women, romance &quot;josei&quot; manga are typically soap opera–influenced melodramas, while pornographic &quot;josei&quot; manga shares many common traits with pornographic manga for a heterosexual male audience. The emergence of manga for an adult female audience as a category in the 1980s was preceded by the rise of &quot;gekiga&quot; in the 1950s and 1960s, which sought to use manga to tell serious and grounded stories aimed at adult audiences, and by the development of more narratively complex &quot;shōjo&quot; manga by artists associated with the Year 24 Group in the 1970s. The category became stigmatized in the late 1980s as it came to be associated with pornographic manga, though it gained greater artistic legitimacy in the 1990s as it shifted to social issue-focused stories. &quot;Josei&quot; manga has been regularly adapted into anime since the 2000s.

==Terminology==
Several terms exist to describe manga aimed at an audience of adult women:
:The first term used to describe this category of manga. It is a &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; construction where &quot;ladies&quot; is understood as a synonym for &quot;women&quot;, thus indicating the adult-focused audience. The term developed a negative connotation in the 1990s as it came to be associated with low-quality and pornographic manga, though this connotation waned by the 2000s. An abbreviation of ladies&#x27; comics is , and in Japan, this abbreviation is the most commonly-used term for this category of manga. 
:A &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; term denoting an intermediate category positioned between manga for adult women and &quot;shōjo&quot; manga.
:A term originated by critics and academics in the late 1990s to distinguish all manga aimed at adult women from &quot;shōjo&quot; manga. While not commonly used among general Japanese audiences, it is the term most commonly used by Western audiences to describe this category of manga.

==History==

While manga aimed at a female audience has an extensive history that is expressed through the development of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga, for much of its history &quot;shōjo&quot; manga was targeted exclusively at an audience of children and young girls. This status quo began to shift in the late 1950s with the emergence of the concept of &quot;gekiga&quot;, which sought to use manga to tell serious and grounded stories aimed at adult audiences. By the late 1960s, &quot;gekiga&quot; was a mainstream artistic movement, and in 1968, the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Josei Seven&quot; published the first &quot;gekiga&quot; manga aimed at a female audience: by Miyako Maki. Maki was a &quot;shōjo&quot; manga artist who debuted in the late 1950s and pivoted to &quot;gekiga&quot; as her original audience aged into adulthood. Two magazines dedicated to women&#x27;s &quot;gekiga&quot; were founded shortly thereafter: by Mushi Production in 1969, and by Futabasha in 1972, though neither were commercially successful and both folded after several issues. 

Despite the commercial failure of women&#x27;s &quot;gekiga&quot;, the 1970s nonetheless saw the significant development of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga through the efforts of artists in the Year 24 Group. The Year 24 Group contributed significantly to the development of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga by creating manga stories that were more psychologically complex, and which dealt directly with topics of politics and sexuality. , who as editor of &quot;Shōjo Comic&quot; published multiple works by the Year 24 Group, became the founding editor of the magazine &quot;Petit Flower&quot; in 1980, which targeted an older teen readership and published adult-focused works by Year 24 Group members Moto Hagio and Keiko Takemiya. Consequently, the readership of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga widened from its historical audience of children to incorporate teenagers and young adult women. Publishers sought to exploit this new market of mature &quot;shōjo&quot; readers by creating dedicated magazines, which came to be described using the genre name &quot;ladies&#x27; comics&quot;. Notable magazines include &quot;Be Love&quot; by Kodansha and &quot;You&quot; by Shueisha in 1980, and &quot;&quot; by Shogakukan in 1981; all three magazines shared the common traits of originating as special issues of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga magazines that were spun off into regular publications, and an editorial focus on romance stories that emphasized sex.

Open depictions of sexual acts came to be a defining trait of ladies&#x27; comics, in contrast to the editorial restrictions still placed on sexual depictions in &quot;shōjo&quot; manga. The manga artist Milk Morizono, renowned for her &quot;porn-chic&quot; stories, emerged as one of the most popular ladies&#x27; comics authors of the 1980s. Ladies&#x27; comics magazines proliferated rapidly in the latter half of the decade, from eight magazines in 1984, to 19 in 1985, to 48 in 1991. By the 1990s, large commercially-published ladies&#x27; comics magazines declined as a result of the Lost Decade and corresponding economic crisis, leading to the proliferation of smaller magazines focused on erotic and pornographic content. Consequently, ladies&#x27; comics developed a reputation as being &quot;female pornography&quot;.

Contemporaneously, new manga magazines aimed at adult women in their early twenties emerged: &quot;Young You&quot; in 1987, &quot;Young Rose&quot; in 1990, and &quot;Feel Young&quot; in 1991. Manga published in these magazines came to be referred to as &quot;young ladies&quot; manga, originating from the word &quot;young&quot; appearing in the title of all three magazines, and was positioned in the manga market as an intermediate category between &quot;shōjo&quot; and ladies comics. Young ladies manga grew in popularity as &quot;shōjo&quot; artists who wished to create manga for an older audience while avoiding the stigma associated with ladies&#x27; comics migrated to the category. Teens&#x27; love also emerged as a subgenre of manga marketed towards women, which utilized the sex-focused narrative structure of ladies&#x27; comics, but with teenaged instead of adult protagonists. Ladies&#x27; comic magazines responded to this new competition by focusing on manga addressing social issues. The strategy was successful, and by the late 1990s had gained greater legitimacy as a literary genre and attracted a more general audience, with multiple ladies&#x27; comics titles adapted as films and television series. The term &quot;josei&quot; manga also emerged during this period, used primarily by academics to distinguish manga aimed at adult women from &quot;shōjo&quot; manga.

&quot;Josei&quot; as a category is generally less popular than &quot;shōjo&quot;, &quot;seinen&quot;, and &quot;shōnen&quot; manga. In 2010, &quot;You&quot; was the top-selling &quot;josei&quot; manga magazine, with a reported circulation of 162,917; by comparison, the top-selling &quot;shōjo&quot; magazine that year (&quot;Ciao&quot;) had a reported circulation of 745,455, while the top-selling &quot;seinen&quot; and &quot;shōnen&quot; magazines (&quot;Weekly Young Jump&quot; and &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;) had reported circulations of 768,980 and 2.8 million, respectively. Anime has been a significant influencing factor in attracting a mainstream audience to &quot;josei&quot; manga since the 2000s, with the &quot;josei&quot; series &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot; (1999), &quot;Bunny Drop&quot; (2005), &quot;Chihayafuru&quot; (2007), &quot;Princess Jellyfish&quot; (2008), and &quot;Eden of the East&quot; (2009) all either originating as popular anime, or enjoying breakout success after being adapted into anime.

==Themes and subgenres==
There are three primary subgenres in &quot;josei&quot; manga: drama, romance, and pornography. In 2002, drama and romance titles collectively represented roughly 80 percent of sales in the &quot;josei&quot; collected volume market, while pornography composed the remaining 20 percent. Drama and romance titles are typically released by large Japanese publishing companies, while pornography is typically published by smaller publishing houses. 

===Drama===
Many &quot;josei&quot; dramas are realist stories about the lives of ordinary women. These stories are typically focused on a working woman in a given profession, most commonly a housewife, office lady, or pink-collar worker. Narratives typically focus on common personal issues such as dating, childcare, eldercare, beauty standards, workplace issues, marital strife, or adultery. Many also address social issues, such as aging and dementia, prostitution, or violence against women. &quot;Josei&quot; manga does also feature male protagonists, typically &quot;bishōnen&quot; (literally &quot;beautiful boys&quot;, roughly analogous to the Western &quot;&quot;) who often appear in stories with homoerotic subtext.

Stories are sometimes based on the experiences of readers themselves, who are actively invited to submit stories based on their own life experiences, and receive payment if their submissions are chosen to be adapted into manga. &quot;Josei&quot; manga magazines often publish special issues dedicated to a specific topic, such as issues devoted to divorce, illnesses, and cosmetic surgery. These topic-based issues occasionally include non-manga columns that provide information about the subjects covered in the issue. Sociologist Kinko Itō considers that &quot;josei&quot; dramas serve as a form of catharsis for the reader by depicting a character who is enduring greater hardship than they are, while manga scholar Fusami Ogi considers &quot;josei&quot; dramas as presenting role models and potential ways of life for female readers.

===Romance===
&quot;Josei&quot; romances typically eschew the realism of &quot;josei&quot; dramas, instead more closely resembling the heightened melodrama of a soap opera or a Harlequin romance novel. Stories often adhere to common romance novel story formulas, such as a woman who encounters a Prince Charming-like man with whom she embarks on a variety of adventures and ultimately marries. Sexual encounters between the protagonist and their partner are commonplace, while romantic fantasy themes often manifest in the setting (frequently either foreign or historical) or through heroic protagonists (princes and princesses, ghosts, people who possess supernatural abilities, etc.). Variant sexual identities, such as gay and transgender characters, also appear in these narratives. &quot;Josei&quot; romances target both a younger and older readership, with many stories aimed at teenaged girls, as evidenced by the extensive use of furigana as a reading aid.

===Pornography===
Pornographic &quot;josei&quot; manga shares many common traits with pornographic manga for a heterosexual male audience, though stories are typically written from a female rather than male point of view. Traits common to heterosexual pornography, such as female domination and objectification, similarly recur in pornographic &quot;josei&quot; manga; a common story formula in &quot;josei&quot; pornography is one in which a shy and intelligent woman is transformed into a nymphomaniac or a sex slave. Lesbian relationships also appear in pornographic &quot;josei&quot; manga, suggesting a lesbian readership of &quot;josei&quot; manga. Manga scholar Deborah Shamoon considers that the appeal of pornographic &quot;josei&quot; for a female audience lies in the ability of drawn pornography to depict subjects that are not easily depicted in filmed pornography, such as the female orgasm.

==Comparison to other manga categories==
===&quot;Shōjo&quot; manga===

When &quot;josei&quot; manga initially emerged in the 1980s, it differentiated itself from &quot;shōjo&quot; manga by exploring adult topics such as work, sex, and life after marriage, and was directed at a readership of women who were &quot;no longer a &quot;shōjo&quot;&quot;. Manga scholar Yukari Fujimoto notes this focus on realism as a primary distinguishing mark of &quot;josei&quot; stories, compared to the more fantastical narratives common in &quot;shōjo&quot; manga. This manifests in the careers commonly held by protagonists in each respective category: actresses, models, and musicians in &quot;shōjo&quot; manga, compared to ordinary working women in &quot;josei&quot; manga. Fujimoto further considers depictions of marriage as a primary dividing line between the categories, with &quot;shōjo&quot; depicting life before marriage, and &quot;josei&quot; depicting life afterwards.

Since the emergence of young ladies manga, distinctions between the categories have been increasingly blurred. In narratives, protagonists of all ages can readily be found in both &quot;shōjo&quot; and &quot;josei&quot; manga, with &quot;shōjo&quot; stories featuring adult protagonists and &quot;josei&quot; stories focusing on teens and younger characters. Stories that depict sex have been published in &quot;shōjo&quot; manga magazines such as &quot;Sho-Comi&quot;, while sex is virtually non-existent in some &quot;josei&quot; magazines such as &quot;Monthly Flowers&quot;. 

At the editorial level, there is no consistent standard for segmenting manga aimed at a female audience, with terminology and categories varying across decades, publishing houses, and magazines. Since the 2000s, some large publishers such as Shueisha and Kodansha have grouped all manga magazines aimed at a female audience under a single category. Formatting of &quot;tankōbon&quot; bound volumes, where larger and more expensive books are traditionally reserved for titles aimed at an adult audience, similarly follow no formal rules, with adult manga sold in small and inexpensive formats and youth manga sold in large formats.

It is common for authors to create &quot;shōjo&quot; and &quot;josei&quot; manga simultaneously, with , George Asakura, and Mayu Shinjo among the numerous artists who produce works across categories. This dynamic contrasts &quot;shōnen&quot; and &quot;seinen&quot; manga, where artists generally produce works in one category exclusively, and artists that do switch categories rarely switch back.

===&quot;Shōnen&quot; and &quot;seinen&quot; manga===
There have been several examples of &quot;josei&quot; works that share common traits with &quot;shōnen&quot; and &quot;seinen&quot; manga, or that blur distinctions between the categories. &quot;Saiyuki&quot; by Kazuya Minekura was serialized in the &quot;shōnen&quot; magazine &quot;Monthly GFantasy&quot;, though its sequel &quot;Saiyuki Reload&quot; was published in the &quot;josei&quot; magazine &quot;Monthly Comic Zero Sum&quot;. Fujio Akatsuka&#x27;s 1962 manga series &quot;Osomatsu-kun&quot; was originally serialized in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;, though when the series was rebooted in 2015 as the anime series &quot;Mr. Osomatsu&quot;, its manga spin-off was published in the &quot;josei&quot; magazines &quot;You&quot; and &quot;Cookie&quot;. Anthony Gramuglia of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; identifies the anime series &quot;Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine&quot;, part of the &quot;Lupin the Third&quot; media franchise, as a notable &quot;josei&quot; adaptation of a &quot;seinen&quot; manga.

<text>The Hermitage is a National Historic Landmark and museum located in Davidson County, Tennessee, United States, east of downtown Nashville in the neighborhood of Hermitage. The + site was owned by President Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States, from 1804 until his death there in 1845. It also serves as his final resting place. Jackson lived at the property intermittently until he retired from public life in 1837.

The Hermitage enslaved men, women, and children, numbering nine at the plantation&#x27;s purchase in 1804 and 110 at Jackson&#x27;s death. They were principally involved in growing cotton, the plantation&#x27;s major cash crop. 

==Mansion and grounds==

===Architecture===
The Hermitage is built in a secluded meadow that was chosen as a house site by Jackson&#x27;s wife, Rachel. From 1804 to 1821 the couple lived there in a log cabin. Together the home and the West, East, and Southeast cabins formed the First Hermitage.

Jackson commissioned construction of a more refined home, and the original plantation house was a two-story, Federal-style mansion built with bricks manufactured onsite. Built between 1819 and 1821, the house had four rooms on both floors, each with a fireplace and chimney. The large central hallways opened in warm weather from front to back to form a breezeway. A simple portico was added later. In 1831, while Jackson was residing in the White House, he had the building remodeled in Classical style under the direction of architect David Morrison. The result included flanking one-story wings, a one-story entrance portico with 10 columns, and a small rear portico.

In 1834, a chimney fire seriously damaged the house, with the exception of the dining room wing. This led to Jackson having a architects Joseph Reiff and William C. Hume design a 13-room, Greek Revival structure, which was built upon the foundation of the former home. It was completed two years later. Reiff and Hume also built Tulip Grove across the road.

The mansion has a rectangular layout, about from east to west and from north to south. The south front is the location of the main entrance and includes a central block with a five-bay, two-story structure with a portico supported by six modified Corinthian style, wooden columns with a simple entablature resting on the capitals. Within the portico is a second-story balcony with simple square balusters. One-story wings with single windows flank the mansion and extend beyond it to the front of the portico, enclosing it on three sides. While the southern façade gives the appearance of a flat roof, the three other elevations show that the tin-covered roof is pitched. The front façade was painted a light tan, and a sand coating was added to the columns and trim to simulate the appearance of stone. A near replica of the front portico is found on the north end of the house, although it features Doric-style columns and is capped with a pediment.

===Interior===
The layout of the main block of the house consists of four large rooms separated by a center hall. The entry hall with plank flooring painted dark is decorated with block-printed wallpaper by Joseph Dufour et Cie of Paris, depicting scenes from Telemachus&#x27; visit to the island of Calypso. At the far end of the hall is the elliptical cantilevered staircase with mahogany handrail that leads to the second level. To the left of the hall are the front and back parlors, featuring crystal chandeliers and Italian marble mantels. Leading from the front parlor is the dining room in the east wing.

Decorated with a high-gloss paint to reflect as much light as possible, the fireplace features a rustic mantelpiece called the &quot;Eighth of January&quot;. It was carved by a veteran of the Battle of New Orleans, who worked on the mantelpiece on each anniversary of the battle until he finished on January 8, 1839. Jackson installed the piece on the next anniversary. Adjacent to the dining room is a pantry and storage room that leads to an open passageway to the kitchen. This was built separate from the house to reduce the risk of fire to the main house as well as eliminate the noise, heat, and odors of cooking. To the right of the entrance hall, accessible via a side hall, are two bedrooms that were occupied by President Jackson and his son, Andrew Jackson, Jr. A spacious library and office used by Jackson and others to manage the site are located in the west wing.

On the second level are four bedrooms used by family members and guests, including Sam Houston, and Presidents James K. Polk and Martin Van Buren.

===Grounds===

The site today covers , which includes the original tract of Jackson&#x27;s land. It is overseen and managed by The Andrew Jackson Foundation, formerly called the Ladies&#x27; Hermitage Association. The mansion is approached by a cedar-lined, wide, guitar-shaped carriage drive designed by Ralph E. W. Earl. The design made it easier to maneuver carriages in the narrow space. To the east of the house was a formal garden designed by Philadelphia-based gardener William Frost in 1819. Laid out in the English four-square kitchen garden style, it consists of four quadrants and a circular center bedroom contained by unusually long, beveled bricks and pebbled pathways. Originally, the garden was primarily used to produce food for the mansion and, secondarily, as an ornamental pleasure garden. It is surrounded by a white picket fence. On the north perimeter stands a brick privy that served as a status symbol as well as a garden feature.

After Rachel Jackson died in 1828, Jackson had her buried in the garden she loved. When he had the house remodeled in 1831, Jackson also had a Classicizing &quot;temple &amp; monument&quot; constructed for Rachel&#x27;s grave. Craftsmen completed the domed limestone tomb with a copper roof in 1832.

Behind the mansion, the property includes a smokehouse that dates to the early 19th century. The large brick smokehouse at the rear of the kitchen was built in 1831 and cured of pork per year. Nearby is a log cabin known as Uncle Alfred&#x27;s Cabin. Alfred Jackson was born enslaved to Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage around 1812 and worked there in various positions. After the Civil War, he stayed as a tenant farmer and later worked as caretaker and guide following the purchase of the estate in 1889 by the Ladies&#x27; Hermitage Association. Jackson died in 1901 and was buried near the tomb of the President and Mrs. Jackson.

Two other cabins were built from materials of the First Hermitage. After Jackson built the main house, the two-story log structure he had lived in for 15 years was disassembled, and the materials were used to build two one-story buildings used as workers&#x27; quarters.

From 1988 to 2005, teams conducted extensive archaeological investigations at the site. Their work revealed the location of an ice house behind the smokehouse and hundreds of thousands of artifacts. A brick triplex of cabins that was likely used by workers and artisans was discovered near the mansion yard. Archaeologists have identified 13 dwellings used by workers. Remains of three foundation pits suggest there were at least two log houses and four brick duplexes. The cotton gin and cotton press (used for baling) were located in one of the cotton fields just beyond the First Hermitage.

==History==
The site that Jackson named Hermitage was located from the Cumberland and Stones Rivers after settlers of European descent ethnically cleansed the region of Native Americans. The land was originally settled in 1780 by Robert Hays, who was the grand uncle of Texas Ranger John Coffee Hays and Confederate General Harry Thompson Hays. Hays sold the farm to Jackson in 1804.

=== Cotton plantation ===
Jackson and his wife moved into the existing two-story log blockhouse, built to resist Indian attacks. A lean-to was added on the back of the cabin and to the rear, a group of log outbuildings were erected, including slave cabins, store rooms, and a smokehouse. This complex is known historically as the First Hermitage. Jackson started operations on his cotton farm with nine African slaves, but he continued to buy more laborers and owned 44 slaves by 1820. This scale of operation ranked him as a major planter and slaveholder in middle Tennessee, where most farmers owned zero or fewer than 10 slaves and 20 slaves marked a major planter. Some slave cabins for domestic servants and artisans were located near the main house. The majority, occupied by laborers, were located closer to the fields in an area known as the Field Quarter.

In 1818–1819, prior to his appointment as provisional Governor of the Florida Territory, Jackson built a brick house to replace the log structure he had lived in after purchasing the land. He also added six brick structures, containing a total of 13 dwelling units for enslaved workers. These included a three-unit building known as the Triplex, built behind the mansion. A two-unit duplex known as the South Cabin was built at the First Hermitage. Four brick duplexes were built at the Field Quarter and were known as Cabins 1, 2, 3, and 4. At least one Field Cabin was still standing as late as the 1920s.

Elected President in 1828, Jackson enlarged the Hermitage during his first term. After an 1834 fire destroyed much of the interior of the house, he rebuilt and refurnished it. At the end of his second term in 1837, Jackson retired to the Hermitage, where he died in 1845. Andrew Jackson was buried in the garden next to his wife.

Throughout his life, Jackson expanded the site to an operation of , with used for cotton, the commodity crop, and the remainder for food production and breeding and training racehorses. By 1840, more than 100 enslaved men, women, and children lived on the estate. This made the estate among the largest in the region; only 24 Tennessee estates in the 1850 census included more than 100 slaves. At the peak of operations, Jackson held 161 slaves in total: 110 at the Hermitage and 51 at Halcyon plantation in Coahoma County, Mississippi.

Jackson&#x27;s adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr., inherited the estate, and Jackson&#x27;s will also gave his son all slaves, except two boys (given to his grandchildren) and four women (given to Andrew Jr.&#x27;s wife, Sarah). Due to debt and bad investments, Jackson Jr. began selling off portions of the estate. In 1856, he sold the remaining , the mansion, and the outbuildings to the State of Tennessee, with a provision that the Jackson family could remain in residence as caretakers of the estate. The state intended to turn over the property to the federal government for use as a southern branch of the United States Military Academy, but the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 disrupted this plan.

=== Civil War and afterwards ===
On May 5, 1863, units of the Union Army from Indiana approached the Hermitage. Pvt. Joseph C. Taylor wrote an account in his diary:

=== Museum ===

Andrew Jackson&#x27;s grandson, Andrew Jackson III, and his family were the last to occupy the Hermitage. The family moved out in 1893, and it ceased being a family residence. The Hermitage was opened to the public by the Ladies&#x27; Hermitage Association, who had been deeded the property by the state of Tennessee for use as a museum of both Jackson&#x27;s life and the antebellum South in general. The Association restored the mansion to its 1837 appearance. Over time, the organization bought back all the land that had been sold, taking ownership of the last parcel that restored the site boundaries in 2003.

The Hermitage escaped disaster during the 1998 Nashville tornado outbreak. An F-3 tornado crossed the property at about 4 p.m. on April 16, 1998, missing the house and grave site but toppling 1,000 trees on the estate, many that were reportedly planted by Jackson himself nearly 200 years earlier. The trees once hid the house from passers-by on U.S. Route 70, but their loss left the mansion in plain sight.

Using wood from the fallen trees, Gibson Guitar Corporation produced 200 limited-edition &quot;Old Hickory&quot; guitars. The first guitar produced was presented to the Smithsonian, although , it was not on display.

The mansion is the most accurately preserved early presidential home in the country. Each year, the home receives more than a quarter million visitors, making it the fourth-most-visited presidential residence in the country (after the White House, Mount Vernon, and Monticello). The property was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960.

Based on archaeological excavations and other research, the Hermitage mounted an exhibition on slave life at the plantation in 2005. It is installed in the Visitor Center and provides much more focus on the lives of enslaved African American families at the plantation, ranging from the domestic staff to field laborers.

=== Enslaved Memorial ===

In 2006, the remains of 61 enslaved people who had been the legal property of Rachel Jackson&#x27;s nephews were discovered near the Hermitage. Their burials were unmarked, but they were arranged in family groups and were estimated to range in age from 1 to 45. The Ladies Hermitage Association took charge of their burials in a new common grave on the Hermitage site. Atop their reburial, a memorial was built in 2009 in remembrance of the enslaved people of the area. The site design, &quot;Our Peace: Follow the Drinking Gourd—A Monument to the Enslaved,&quot; proposed by Aaron Lee Benson, includes an unmarked stone wall over the burial site and seven trees arranged in the shape of the Little Dipper. Both the constellation and &quot;follow the drinking gourd&quot; refer to the practice of navigating by the North Star to escape from slavery.

=== Hermitage slave cemetery ===
In 2024, researchers found a burial ground believed to hold the graves of 28 enslaved people. Researchers had been looking for the slave burial ground for well over 20 years. Some historians have speculated that Lyncoya Jackson may have been buried in the slave cemetery.

=== Confederate Soldiers Home Cemetery ===
Part of the Hermitage estate that passed in to public hands became the site of the state-funded Confederate Soldiers Home, a residential facility that housed poor and disabled Confederate veterans beginning in 1892. More than 480 veterans who died there were buried in an onsite cemetery, each marked with a white, military-style gravestone and arrayed in circles around a monumental stone.

==Legacy==
The city in Davidson County where the Hermitage is located is known as Hermitage, Tennessee. A hotel named the Hermitage Hotel, located in downtown Nashville, opened in 1910 and is still operating. Many celebrities and U.S. presidents have spent time there.

<doc id="294492" wikidata="Q1938388" url="?curid=294492" title="Miriam">
<text>Miriam ( &quot;Mīryām&quot;, lit. &#x27;Rebellion&#x27;) is described in the Hebrew Bible as the daughter of Amram and Jochebed, and the older sister of Moses and Aaron. She was a prophetess and first appears in the Book of Exodus.

The Torah refers to her as &quot;Miriam the Prophetess&quot; and the Talmud names her as one of the seven major female prophets of Israel. Scripture describes her alongside of Moses and Aaron as delivering the Jews from exile in Egypt: &quot;For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam&quot;. According to the Midrash, just as Moses led the men out of Egypt and taught them Torah, so too Miriam led the women and taught them Torah.

== Biblical narrative ==
Miriam was the daughter of Amram and Jochebed and the sister of Aaron and Moses, the leader of the Israelites in ancient Egypt. The narrative of Moses&#x27;s infancy in the Torah describes an unnamed sister of Moses observing him being placed in the Nile (); she is traditionally identified as Miriam.

In the biblical narrative of The Exodus, Miriam is described as a &quot;prophetess&quot; when she leads the Israelites in the Song of the Sea after the Pharaoh&#x27;s army is destroyed at the Yam Suph.

When the Israelites are camped at Hazeroth after leaving Mount Sinai, Miriam and Aaron speak against Moses because he had married an unnamed &quot;Ethiopian&quot; or &quot;Cushite&quot; woman (translations differ). God comes down in a pillar of cloud and rebukes them, emphasizing the supreme prophetic authority of Moses. After God departs, Miriam appears white with a skin disease (tzaraath, traditionally translated as &quot;leprosy&quot;). Aaron asks for forgiveness and for Miriam to be cured, and Moses relays the prayer to God, who says that Miriam should be excluded from the Israelite camp for seven days, which is done.

Regarding the death of Miriam, the Torah states, &quot;The entire congregation of the children of Israel arrived at the desert of Tzin in the first month, and the people settled in Kadesh. Miriam died and was buried there.&quot;

==Interpretations and elaboration==

===Cushite wife===

The Midrash explains the entire story as follows: It became known to Miriam and Aaron that Moses had separated from intimacy with his wife Tzipora. They disapproved of this separation because they considered her to be outstandingly righteous, much as a dark-skinned person stands out among light-skinned people—hence the reference to Tzipora as a &quot;Cushite&quot;. This usage of the word Cushite is non-pejorative and is often used in Jewish sources as a term for someone unique and outstanding. In fact, King Saul and even the Jewish people are referred to by the term &quot;Cushite&quot;. Their complaint, therefore, was not about the &quot;union&quot; between Moses and Tzipora, but about their &quot;separation&quot;. The only justification they could find for Moses&#x27;s celibacy was in order to maintain his prophetic state. This explains their claim that God spoke not only to Moses but also to them, yet they had not separated from their spouses.

But God rebuked them by calling them all out &quot;suddenly&quot;, causing Miriam and Aaron a great burning sensation since they lacked immersion in a &quot;mikva&quot; after marital relations. God thus demonstrated to them Moses&#x27;s unique level of prophecy for which he had to be prepared at all times, thereby justifying his separation from Tzipora. Afterwards, &quot;God&#x27;s wrath flared against them.&quot; Rabbi Louis Ginzberg wrote the anger of God to them.

Afterward, Miriam is left with bodily tzara&#x27;at, which according to Jewish sources is a divine punishment for slander. This was because she, not Aaron, was the one who initiated the complaint against Moses. Despite Miriam&#x27;s intent to help Tzipora, she should have judged Moses favorably and approached Moses on Tzipora&#x27;s behalf privately. Aaron asks Moses to intercede for Miriam, Moses prays to God to heal her, and God concedes after requiring a quarantine of seven days.

Both Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, but only Miriam contracted &quot;tzara&#x27;at&quot;. It has been suggested that since according to the Hebrew Bible anyone with &quot;tzara&#x27;at&quot; was &quot;tamei&quot; (), Aaron was spared this punishment in order not to interrupt his duties as High Priest. However, noting the wording of the verse, &quot;God&#x27;s wrath flared against them [i.e., both Aaron and Miriam]&quot;, the Talmud appears to conclude that Aaron was also smitten with &quot;tzara&#x27;at&quot; initially, but was then immediately cured.

==== Alternative explanations ====

It has been suggested that Josephus and Irenaeus (who merely cites Josephus) identify the Cushite woman as Tharbis, &quot;the daughter of the king of the Ethiopians&quot;. However, while Josephus does describe a legend (which is not written in the Torah) wherein Moses marries this princess during a military campaign he leads in Ethiopia, according to Josephus this marriage occurs while Moses is still a royal prince of Egypt long before he re-discovers his oppressed Jewish brethren. After which time, upon fleeing as a solitary fugitive from Egypt, Moses marries Tzipora the daughter of Yitro the Midianite, as recorded in the Torah. Thus Josephus himself records Moses&#x27;s marriage to Tzipora as separate and subsequent to his earlier marriage to Tharbis. Furthermore, according to the conclusion of the Tharbis legend, Moses fashioned a miraculous ring which caused her to forget her love for him, and he then returned to Egypt alone. Therefore, even according to Josephus, Moses&#x27;s first marriage to Tharbis as military leader of Egypt terminated long before his later marriage to Tzipora as fugitive from Egypt, such that the Cushite wife of Moses mentioned in the Torah after the Exodus appears to be Tzipora, as explained above.

Richard E. Friedman writes that since Cush is generally understood to mean &quot;Ethiopia&quot;, it is possible that the &quot;Cushite woman&quot; is not Tzipora. But he adds that since there is a place called Cushan which is a region of Midian, and Moses&#x27;s wife Tzipora has already been identified as a Midianite, it is possible that the term &quot;Cushite&quot; relates to Tzipora&#x27;s being from Cushan. However, Friedman&#x27;s primary interest is not in the identity of the Cushite woman, but rather in the outcome of this story which establishes Moses&#x27;s superiority over Aaron as an example of his claim that rival priesthoods created or publicized tales in order to legitimize their respective claims to privilege and power. He describes the Aaronid priesthood in the Kingdom of Judah, which claimed descent from Aaron and which controlled the Temple in Jerusalem, as opposed to a priesthood which claimed allegiance to Moses and was based at Shiloh in the Kingdom of Israel. Using interpretations from the documentary hypothesis, he notes that this story, which he calls &quot;Snow-White Miriam&quot;, was authored by the Elohist who he claims was from, or supported, the Shiloh priesthood, and thus promoted this tale to assert Moses&#x27;s superiority over Aaron and thereby belittle the Aaronid priesthood in Judah. However, the identity of the Cushite woman referred to in this story is tangential to Friedman and his opinion remains inconclusive.

=== The Well of Miriam ===
Miriam&#x27;s death is described in Numbers 20:1, and in the next verse the Israelites are described as complaining of the lack of water at Kadesh. The text reads, &quot;Miriam died there, and was buried there. And there was no water for the congregation.&quot;

In Jewish folk-religious tradition this abrupt transition between her death and the lack of water was explained by postulating a &quot;well of Miriam&quot; that dried up when she died. Further elaboration identified the rock that Moses struck to bring forth water in Exodus 17:5–6 with this well, and it was said that the rock travelled with the people until Miriam&#x27;s death.

The Talmud says, &quot;Three great leaders led Israel: Moses, Aaron and Miriam. In their merit they received three great gifts: the Well [Miriam], the Clouds of Glory [Aaron] and the Manna [Moses].&quot; When Miriam died, the well was removed as is evidenced by the fact that immediately after the verse &quot;And Miriam died&quot;, there was no water for the community.

Rashi says that this well was the same rock from which Moses brought forth water after Miriam&#x27;s death. The Midrash states that when they encamped, the leader of each Tribe took his staff to the well and drew a line in the sand toward his Tribe&#x27;s encampment. The waters of the well were drawn after the mark and thus supplied water for each of the Tribes.

== Symbolism in modern practice ==
Miriam is a popular figure among some Jewish feminists. Thus, in addition to the traditional cup of wine that is set for the Prophet Elijah, some feminist-inspired Seders set a cup of water for Miriam which is sometimes also accompanied by a ritual in her honor. Miriam&#x27;s Cup originated in the 1980s in a Boston Rosh Chodesh group; it was invented by Stephanie Loo, who filled it with what she referred to as &quot;mayim chayim&quot; (living waters) and used it in a feminist ceremony of guided meditation. Miriam&#x27;s cup is linked to the &quot;midrash&quot; of Miriam&#x27;s Well, described as &quot;a rabbinic legend that tells of a miraculous well that accompanied the Israelites during their forty years in the desert at the Exodus from Egypt&quot;.

Some Modern Orthodox Jews have revived an ancient custom of adding a piece of fish to the Seder plate in honor of Miriam who is associated with water, based on the teaching in the Talmud that God gave manna (on the ground) in the merit of Moses, clouds of glory (in the sky) in the merit of Aaron and a well (of water) in the merit of Miriam. Accordingly, the lamb (earth), egg (air) and fish (water) in the Seder symbolize the three prophets Moses, Aaron and Miriam, respectively, whom God chose to redeem the Jews from Egypt. Similarly, the lamb, egg and fish also allude to the three mythical creatures in Jewish tradition—the land beast Behemoth, the bird Ziz, and the sea-creature Leviathan, respectively. According to the Midrash, the Leviathan and Behemoth, as well as the Ziz, are to be served at the Seudat Techiyat HaMetim (the feast for the righteous following the Resurrection of the Dead), to which the Passover Seder alludes, insofar as it commemorates the past Redemption together with the Cup of Elijah&#x27;s heralding the future, Final Redemption.

==Islamic account==
There is no mention of Moses&#x27;s sister&#x27;s name specifically in the Quran, where she is referred to as &quot;his sister&quot; or &quot;Moses&#x27;s sister&quot;, while in a few hadiths she is named as Kulthum. 

In the Quran, as in the Hebrew Bible, Miriam obeys her mother&#x27;s request to follow the baby Moses as he floats down the river in a basket, their mother having set him afloat so he would not be killed by Pharaoh&#x27;s servants and soldiers (). Later on, Asiya, wife of Pharaoh, finds Moses at the river and adopts him as her own, but Moses refuses to be suckled by her. Miriam asks Pharaoh&#x27;s wife and her handmaidens to have his own mother act as nursemaid to Moses, the mother&#x27;s identity not being known to Pharaoh&#x27;s wife ().

According to a few hadiths, Muhammad will marry Miriam in Paradise.

==Veneration==
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Miriam is commemorated twice in the period before Christmas, on the Sunday of the Forefathers and the Sunday of the Fathers, and on the Wednesday after Easter along with all of the other saints who labored on Mt. Sinai.

<doc id="294494" wikidata="Q5422267" url="?curid=294494" title="Extraterritorial jurisdiction">
<text>Extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) is the legal ability of a government to exercise authority beyond its normal boundaries.

Any authority can claim ETJ over any external territory they wish. However, for the claim to be effective in the external territory (except by the exercise of force), it must be agreed either with the legal authority in the external territory, or with a legal authority that covers both territories. When unqualified, ETJ usually refers to such an agreed jurisdiction, or it will be called &quot;claimed ETJ&quot; or similar terms.

The phrase may also refer to a country&#x27;s laws extending beyond its boundaries in the sense that they may authorise the courts of that country to enforce their jurisdiction against parties appearing before them in with respect to acts they allegedly engaged in outside that country. This does not depend on the co-operation of other countries, since the affected people are within the relevant country (or at least, in a case involving a person being tried &quot;in absentia&quot;, the case is being heard by a court of that country). For example, many countries have laws which give their criminal courts jurisdiction to try prosecutions for piracy, sexual offences against children, computer crimes and/or terrorism committed outside their national boundaries. Sometimes such laws only apply to nationals of that country, and sometimes they may apply to anyone.

==Terminology==
Some confusion has arisen as to the meaning of &quot;extraterritorial jurisdiction.&quot; In its broad application, the term refers to criminal acts that were committed outside the sovereign territory of a prosecuting state. Cedric Ryngaert, Professor of Public International Law and Head of the Department of International and European Law at Utrecht University, noted that a state asserting jurisdiction over crimes committed in other jurisdictions would still prosecute in the state&#x27;s own territorial courts.

==Cases of exercised jurisdiction==

===Diplomatic missions===
Diplomatic immunity of foreign embassies and consulates in host countries is governed by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. They remain under the jurisdiction of the host country but are &#x27;inviolable&#x27; (the host country&#x27;s agents may not enter the premises, or detain accredited diplomats).

===Military forces===
Status of forces agreements and visiting forces agreements are in effect in many countries that allow visiting forces to exercise jurisdiction over members of their forces that are stationed in the host country.

===Criminal law===
Criminal jurisdiction can be of an extraterritorial nature where:

* a nation asserts it either generally or in specific cases under its domestic law,
* a supranational authority (such as the United Nations Security Council) has created an international court to deal with a specific case (e.g. war crimes in a certain country), or
* an international court has been created under a treaty to deal with a stated area of jurisdiction.

Criminal codes in certain countries assert jurisdiction over crimes committed outside the country:

* in France, the &quot;Code pénal&quot; asserts general jurisdiction over crimes by, or against, the country&#x27;s citizens, no matter where they may have occurred; this is also the case with regard to those who became French citizens after the act. Double criminality is required except in the cases of felonies (crimes) which carry custodial sentences of ten years or more.
* in Japan, the Penal Code specifies certain cases and applicable lists of crimes over which jurisdiction will be asserted.

Many countries have implemented laws that allow their nationals to be prosecuted by their courts for crimes such as war crimes and genocide even when the crime is committed extraterritorially. In addition, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court has been incorporated into domestic law in many countries to provide for the International Criminal Court to exercise jurisdiction within their borders.

===Sanctions against foreign countries===
Economic sanctions against other countries may be instituted under either domestic law or under the authority of the United Nations Security Council, and their severity can include measures against foreign persons operating outside the country in question.

In 2017, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Union President Jean-Claude Juncker criticized the draft of new U.S. sanctions against Russia targeting the EU–Russia energy projects. France’s foreign ministry described the new U.S. sanctions as illegal under international law due to their extraterritorial reach.

===Competition law===
Extraterritorial jurisdiction plays a significant role in regulation of transnational anti-competitive practices. In the U.S., extraterritorial impacts in this field first arose from &quot;Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States&quot;, where Imperial Oil in Canada was ordered to be divested from Standard Oil. Current practice dates from &quot;United States v. Alcoa&quot;, where the &quot;effects doctrine&quot; was introduced, allowing for jurisdiction over foreign offenders and foreign conduct, so long as the economic effects of the anticompetitive conduct are experienced on the domestic market. The effects doctrine has been gradually developed in the U.S. and then in various forms accepted in other jurisdictions, also in the developing world. In the EU it is recognised based on the &quot;qualified effects&quot; or &quot;implementation test&quot;.

Extraterritorial jurisdiction in the area of antitrust faces various limitations, such as the problem of accessing foreign-based evidence, as well as the difficulties of challenged anticompetitive conduct arising from foreign state involvement.

==Application in specific countries==

===Commonwealth of Nations===
The ability of parliaments of Commonwealth countries to legislate extraterritorially was confirmed by s. 3 of the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot;.

In Australia, extraterritorial jurisdiction of the state parliaments was authorized by s.2 of the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot;.

===Canada===
The &quot;Criminal Code&quot; asserts jurisdiction over the following offences outside Canada:

:* on a Canadian aircraft in flight, or on any other flight which terminates in Canada, for any indictable offence
:* on any aircraft or in any airport in the world, for endangering such facilities
:* by a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or stateless person resident in Canada, for offences relating to cultural property protected by the &quot;Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict&quot;
:* against or on board a Canadian ship on the high seas or a fixed platform attached to the continental shelf of Canada, or by or against a Canadian citizen on any ship or fixed platform, or by any person who is found in Canada after such offence
:* on a Canadian ship or aircraft, relating to
::* hostage taking,
::* offences against internationally protected persons or United Nations personnel, or
::* terrorism financing
:* on the International Space Station
:* involving nuclear material
:* involving terrorism
:* terrorist activity against Canadian citizens or Canadian government missions, or intended to compel the Canadian government, or any provincial government, to do or not do a particular act
:* relating to sexual offences against children

=== China ===
Article 38 of the Hong Kong national security law, passed in Jun 2020, asserts that the law applies to all persons - regardless of nationality - both inside and outside Hong Kong.

Crimes covered under the national security law include:
:* advocating, planning, or supporting secession or changes in Hong Kong or the People&#x27;s Republic of China sovereignty.
:* subverting the People&#x27;s Republic of China government and system, including related participation, organizing, planning, and financially supporting these activities
:* substantially interfering or obstructing the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Hong Kong government functions
:* acts of terrorism, defined as including damaging transportation equipment, causing traffic obstructions, or otherwise substantially interfering with the public&#x27;s health and safety
:* colluding with foreign forces to harm national security, defined as including causing substantial obstruction to the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Hong Kong government policies, controlling elections, seeking foreign sanctions, or inciting hate against the Chinese and Hong Kong governments.

===Ireland===
=== United Kingdom ===
Under Section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, British citizens can be prosecuted for sexual offences committed against children abroad. Section 72 was used to convict paedophile Richard Huckle on 71 counts of serious sexual offences against children in Malaysia. Huckle was sentenced to 22 life sentences. While no official tally is kept, seven people are believed to have been convicted under Section 72.

The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 asserted extraterritorial jurisdiction to close the loophole whereby girls could be taken outside the UK to undergo FGM procedures.

The Nuclear Explosions (Prohibition and Inspections) Act 1998 in Section 2 prohibits United Kingdom nationals, Scottish partnerships or bodies incorporated under the law of any part of the United Kingdom from knowingly causing a nuclear explosion in the United Kingdom &quot;or elsewhere&quot;.

===United States===

====Municipal and state law====
In the U.S., many states have laws or even constitutional provisions which permit cities to make certain decisions about the land beyond the town&#x27;s incorporated limits.

:* Examples of states which allow cities to claim ETJ with respect to zoning or other matters, either generally or prior to annexation, are:
::* Alaska
::* Arkansas
::* Nebraska,
::* North Carolina, and
::* Texas
:* In California, county Local Agency Formation Commissions determine spheres of influence that cities may exercise over areas outside their boundaries.

====Federal law====
The U.S. Criminal Code asserts the following items to fall within the &quot;special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States&quot;, much of which is extraterritorial in nature:
# The high seas and any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, including any vessels owned by US persons that are travelling on them
# Any US vessel travelling on the Great Lakes, connecting waters or the Saint Lawrence River (where that river forms part of the Canada–United States border)
# Any lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof
# Any island claimed under the &quot;Guano Islands Act&quot;
# Any US aircraft flying over waters in the same manner as US vessels
# Any US spacecraft when in flight
# Any place outside the jurisdiction of any nation with respect to an offense by or against a national of the United States
# Any foreign vessel during a voyage having a scheduled departure from or arrival in the United States with respect to an offense committed by or against a national of the United States
# Offenses committed by or against a national of the United States in diplomatic missions, consulates, military and other missions, together with related residences, outside the US
# International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act

Individuals involved in doping at major international sporting events can be sanctioned by the United States via the Rodchenkov Act if American companies are involved in sponsoring those events or the American financial system is utilized by the organizers.

In order to deal with the issue of private military contractors and private security contractors being used by U.S. Government agencies overseas, the &quot;Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act&quot; was passed by Congress to subject them to a similar manner of jurisdiction.

Certain federal property has the status of federal enclave, restricting the application of state laws, but that has been partially rectified by the &quot;Assimilative Crimes Act&quot;. Similarly, state jurisdiction is restricted on Native American tribal lands.

Generally, the U.S. founding fathers and early courts believed that American laws could not have jurisdiction over sovereign countries. In a 1909 Supreme Court case, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes introduced what came to be known as the &quot;presumption against extraterritoriality,&quot; making explicit this judicial preference that U.S. laws not be applied to other countries. American thought about extraterritoriality has changed over the years, however. For example, the Alien Tort Statute of 1789 allows foreign citizens in the United States to bring cases before federal courts against foreign defendants for violations of the &quot;law of nations&quot; in foreign countries. Although this statute was ignored for many years, U.S. courts since the 1980s have interpreted it to allow foreigners to seek justice in cases of human-rights violations in foreign lands, such as in &quot;Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain&quot;. In &quot;Morrison v. National Australia Bank,&quot; 2010, the Supreme Court held that in interpreting a statute, the &quot;presumption against extraterritoriality&quot; is absolute unless the text of the statute explicitly says otherwise.

====Economic law====
Economic sanctions with extraterritorial impact have been instituted under:

:* the &quot;Trading with the Enemy Act&quot; (as in the case of the embargo against Cuba)
:* the &quot;Arms Export Control Act&quot; and &quot;International Traffic in Arms Regulations&quot; (in governing the re-export of subject goods and technologies after initial export from the US)
:* the &quot;International Emergency Economic Powers Act&quot; (especially in the case of sanctions against Iran)
:* the &quot;Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act&quot;

<text>Prediction markets, also known as betting markets, information markets, decision markets, idea futures or event derivatives, are open markets that enable the prediction of specific outcomes using financial incentives. They are exchange-traded markets established for trading bets in the outcome of various events. The market prices can indicate what the crowd thinks the probability of the event is. A typical prediction market contract is set up to trade between 0 and 100%. The most common form of a prediction market is a binary option market, which will expire at the price of 0 or 100%. Prediction markets can be thought of as belonging to the more general concept of crowdsourcing which is specially designed to aggregate information on particular topics of interest. The main purposes of prediction markets are eliciting aggregating beliefs over an unknown future outcome. Traders with different beliefs trade on contracts whose payoffs are related to the unknown future outcome and the market prices of the contracts are considered as the aggregated belief.

==History==
Before the era of scientific polling, early forms of prediction markets often existed in the form of political betting. One such political bet dates back to 1503, in which people bet on who would be the papal successor. Even then, it was already considered &quot;an old practice&quot;. According to Paul Rhode and Koleman Strumpf, who have researched the history of prediction markets, there are records of election betting in Wall Street dating back to 1884. Rhode and Strumpf estimate that average betting turnover per US presidential election is equivalent to over 50 percent of the campaign spend.

As far back as 1907, Francis Galton found that the median estimate of a group can be more accurate than individual expert estimates. This is now known as the wisdom of the crowd.

Economic theory for the ideas behind prediction markets can be credited to Friedrich Hayek in his 1945 article &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot; and Ludwig von Mises in his &quot;Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth&quot;. Modern economists agree that Mises&#x27; argument combined with Hayek&#x27;s elaboration of it, is correct. Prediction markets are championed in James Surowiecki&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;The Wisdom of Crowds&quot;, Cass Sunstein&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Infotopia&quot;, and Douglas Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business&quot;. The research literature is collected together in the peer-reviewed &quot;The Journal of Prediction Markets&quot;, edited by Leighton Vaughan Williams and published by the University of Buckingham Press.

===Milestones===
* One of the first modern electronic prediction markets is the University of Iowa&#x27;s Iowa Electronic Markets, introduced during the 1988 US presidential election. 
* Around 1990 at Project Xanadu, Robin Hanson used the first known corporate prediction market. Employees used it in order to bet on, for example, the cold fusion controversy. 
* HedgeStreet, designated in 1991 as a market and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, enables Internet traders to speculate on economic events.
*The Hollywood Stock Exchange, a virtual market game established in 1996 and now a division of Cantor Fitzgerald, LP, in which players buy and sell prediction shares of movies, actors, directors, and film-related options, correctly predicted 32 of 2006&#x27;s 39 big-category Oscar nominees and 7 out of 8 top category winners.
* In 2001, Intrade.com launched a prediction market trading platform from Ireland allowing real money trading between members on contracts related to a number of different categories including business issues, current events, financial topics, and more. Intrade ceased trading in 2013.
* In July 2003, the U.S. Department of Defense publicized a Policy Analysis Market on their website, and speculated that additional topics for markets might include terrorist attacks. A critical backlash quickly denounced the program as a &quot;terrorism futures market&quot; and the Pentagon hastily canceled the program.
* In 2005, scientific monthly journal &quot;Nature&quot; stated how major pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company used prediction markets to help predict which development drugs might have the best chance of advancing through clinical trials, by using internal markets to forecast outcomes of drug research and development efforts.
* Also in 2005, Google Inc announced that it has been using prediction markets to forecast product launch dates, new office openings, and many other things of strategic importance. Other companies such as HP and Microsoft also conduct private markets for statistical forecasts.
* In October 2007, companies from the United States, Ireland, Austria, Germany, and Denmark formed the Prediction Market Industry Association, tasked with promoting awareness, education, and validation for prediction markets. The current status of the association appears to be defunct.
* In July 2018, the first decentralized prediction market Augur was launched on the Ethereum blockchain.
* In October 2024, Kalshi, a financial exchange and prediction market, won a lawsuit against its regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, with a federal appeals court in Washington allowing it to revive the first fully regulated election prediction markets in the United States. Kalshi&#x27;s court victory over the CFTC opened the market for election markets.
==Accuracy==
Prediction markets are based on the theory that individuals with financial stakes in an outcome can collectively predict it more accurately than any single expert. Even if participants are not highly informed, the collective wisdom emerges from their shared incentive to avoid financial loss. Eric Zitzewitz, an economics professor at Dartmouth, explains &quot;Financial markets are generally pretty efficient, and the evidence suggests that the same is true of prediction markets. There’s no virtue-signaling in an anonymous market when you’re betting and that &quot;what you’re seeing with the market is some average of all of those different opinions, weighted by their willingness to put their money where their mouth is.&quot;

The ability of the prediction market to aggregate information and make accurate predictions is based on the efficient-market hypothesis, which postulates that asset prices are fully reflecting of all publicly available information. For instance, according to the efficient-market hypothesis, existing share prices always include all the relevant related information for the stock market to make accurate predictions.

While prediction markets tend to perform better than polling for prediction of election outcomes, a study found that belief aggregation of participants that are asked to quantify the strength of their belief can beat prediction markets. When market participants have some intrinsic interest in trying to predict results, even markets with modest incentives or no incentives have been shown to be effective. When the group is more optimistic they will &#x27;bet&#x27; more in aggregate than the pessimists, raising the market price. The movement of the price will reflect more information than a simple average or vote count. Research has suggested that prediction markets&#x27; greater accuracy lies largely in superior aggregation methods rather than superior quality or informativeness of responses.

James Surowiecki raises three necessary conditions for collective wisdom: diversity of information, independence of decision, and decentralization of organization. In the case of a predictive market, each participant normally has diversified information from others and makes their decision independently. The market itself has a character of decentralization compared to expertise decisions. For these reasons, a predictive market is generally a valuable source to capture collective wisdom and make accurate predictions.

Prediction markets can aggregate information and beliefs of the involved investors and give a good estimate of the mean belief of those investors. The latter have a financial incentive to price in information. This allows prediction markets to quickly incorporate new information and makes them difficult to manipulate.

The accuracy of prediction markets has been studied by numerous researchers:
* Steven Gjerstad (Purdue), in his paper &quot;Risk Aversion, Beliefs, and Prediction Market Equilibrium&quot;, has shown that prediction market prices are very close to the mean belief of market participants if the agents are risk averse and the distribution of beliefs is spread out (as with a normal distribution, for example).
* Justin Wolfers (Wharton) and Eric Zitzewitz (Dartmouth) have obtained similar results to Gjerstad&#x27;s conclusions in their paper &quot;Interpreting Prediction Market Prices as Probabilities&quot;.
* Lionel Page and Robert Clemen have looked at the quality of predictions for events taking place some time in the future and provide evidence for a favourite-longshot bias. They found that predictions are better when the event predicted is close in time. For events which take place further in time (e.g. elections in more than a year), prices are biased towards 50%. This bias comes from the traders&#x27; &quot;time preferences&quot; (their preferences not to lock their funds for a long time in assets). 
Due to the accuracy of the prediction market, it has been applied to different industries to make important decisions. Some examples include:
* Prediction markets can be utilized to improve forecasting and have a potential application to test lab-based information theories based on its feature of information aggregation. Researchers have applied prediction markets to assess unobservable information in Google&#x27;s IPO valuation ahead of time.
* In healthcare, predictive markets can help forecast the spread of infectious disease. In a pilot study, a statewide influenza in Iowa was predicted by these markets 2–4 weeks in advance with clinical data volunteered from participating health care workers.
* Some corporations have harnessed internal predictive markets for decisions and forecasts. In these cases, employees can use virtual currency to bet on what they think will happen for this company in the future. The most accurate guesser will win a money prize as payoff. For example, Best Buy once experimented on using the predictive market to predict whether a Shanghai store can be open on time. The virtual dollar drop in the market successfully forecasted the lateness of the business and prevented the company from extra money loss.

Although prediction markets are often fairly accurate and successful, there are many times the market fails in making the right prediction or making one at all. Based mostly on an idea in 1945 by Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek, prediction markets are &quot;mechanisms for collecting vast amounts of information held by individuals and synthesizing it into a useful data point&quot;.

One way the prediction market gathers information is through James Surowiecki&#x27;s phrase, &quot;The Wisdom of Crowds&quot;, in which a group of people with a sufficiently broad range of opinions can collectively be cleverer than any individual. However, this information gathering technique can also lead to the failure of the prediction market. Oftentimes, the people in these crowds are skewed in their independent judgements due to peer pressure, panic, bias, and other breakdowns developed out of a lack of diversity of opinion.

One of the main constraints and limits of the wisdom of crowds is that some prediction questions require specialized knowledge that majority of people do not have. Due to this lack of knowledge, the crowd&#x27;s answers can sometimes be very wrong.

The second market mechanism is the idea of the marginal-trader hypothesis. According to this theory, &quot;there will always be individuals seeking out places where the crowd is wrong&quot;. These individuals, in a way, put the prediction market back on track when the crowd fails and values could be skewed.

In early 2017, researchers at MIT developed the &quot;surprisingly popular&quot; algorithm to help improve answer accuracy from large crowds. The method is built off the idea of taking confidence into account when evaluating the accuracy of an answer. The method asks people two things for each question: What they think the right answer is, and what they think popular opinion will be. The variation between the two aggregate responses indicates the correct answer.

The effects of manipulation and biases are also internal challenges prediction markets need to deal with, i.e. liquidity or other factors not intended to be measured are taken into account as risk factors by the market participants, distorting the market probabilities. Prediction markets may also be subject to speculative bubbles. For example, in the year 2000 IEM presidential futures markets, seeming &quot;inaccuracy&quot; comes from buying that occurred on or after Election Day, 11/7/00, but, by then, the trend was clear.

There can also be direct attempts to manipulate such markets. In the Tradesports 2004 presidential markets there was an apparent manipulation effort. An anonymous trader sold short so many Bush 2004 presidential futures contracts that the price was driven to zero, implying a zero percent chance that Bush would win. The only rational purpose of such a trade would be an attempt to manipulate the market in a strategy called a &quot;bear raid&quot;. If this was a deliberate manipulation effort it failed, however, as the price of the contract rebounded rapidly to its previous level. As more press attention is paid to prediction markets, it is likely that more groups will be motivated to manipulate them. However, in practice, such attempts at manipulation have always proven to be very short lived. In their paper entitled &quot;Information Aggregation and Manipulation in an Experimental Market&quot; (2005), Hanson, Oprea and Porter (George Mason U), show how attempts at market manipulation can in fact end up increasing the accuracy of the market because they provide that much more profit incentive to bet against the manipulator.

Using real-money prediction market contracts as a form of insurance can also affect the price of the contract. For example, if the election of a leader is perceived as negatively impacting the economy, traders may buy shares of that leader being elected, as a hedge.

These prediction market inaccuracies were especially prevalent during Brexit and the 2016 US presidential elections. On Thursday, 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Even until the moment votes were counted, prediction markets leaned heavily on the side of staying in the EU and failed to predict the outcomes of the vote. According to Michael Traugott, a former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the reason for the failure of the prediction markets is due to the influence of manipulation and bias shadowed by mass opinion and public opinion. Clouded by the similar mindset of users in prediction markets, they created a paradoxical environment where they began self-reinforcing their initial beliefs (in this case, that the UK would vote to remain in the EU). Here, we can observe the ruinous effect that bias and lack of diversity of opinion may have in the success of a prediction market.
Similarly, during the 2016 US Presidential Elections, prediction markets failed to predict the outcome, throwing the world into mass shock. Like the Brexit case, information traders were caught in an infinite loop of self-reinforcement once initial odds were measured, leading traders to &quot;use the current prediction odds as an anchor&quot; and seemingly discounting incoming prediction odds completely. Traders essentially treated the market odds as correct probabilities and did not update enough using outside information, causing the prediction markets to be too stable to accurately represent current circumstances. Koleman Strumpf, a University of Kansas professor of business economics, also suggests that a bias effect took place during the US elections; the crowd was unwilling to believe in an outcome with Donald Trump winning and caused the prediction markets to turn into &quot;an echo chamber&quot;, where the same information circulated and ultimately lead to a stagnant market.

Prediction markets can yield better estimates of the mean opinion across a population than opinion polls. A study found that for the five U.S. presidential elections between 1988 and 2004, prediction markets gave a more accurate estimate of the voting result than 74% of the studied opinion polls. On the other hand, a randomized experiment from 2016 obtained that prediction markets were 12% less accurate than prediction polls, an alternative method for eliciting and statistically aggregating probability judgments from a crowd.

==Other issues==
===Legality===
Prediction markets in the United States are overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Because online gambling is outlawed in the United States through federal laws and many state laws as well, most prediction markets that target US users operate with &quot;play money&quot; rather than &quot;real money&quot;: they are free to play (no purchase necessary) and usually offer prizes to the best traders as incentives to participate. Notable exceptions are the Iowa Electronic Markets, which is operated by the University of Iowa under the cover of a no-action letter from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and PredictIt, which is operated by Victoria University of Wellington under cover of a similar no-action letter.

===Controversial incentives===
Some kinds of prediction markets may create controversial incentives. For example, a market predicting the death of a world leader might be quite useful for those whose activities are strongly related to this leader&#x27;s policies, but it also might turn into an assassination market.

==List of prediction markets==
*Augur (software) is a decentralized prediction market platform built on the Ethereum blockchain.
*Good Judgment Open is a reputation-based prediction website.
*The Iowa Electronic Markets is an academic market examining elections where positions are limited to $500.
*iPredict was a prediction market in New Zealand.
*Kalshi, is a U.S. CFTC-regulated betting market and available only for U.S. residents.
*Manifold is a reputation-based prediction market that also features &#x27;Sweepcash&#x27; which can be withdrawn for real money.
*Metaculus is a reputation-based prediction website with the ability to make numeric-range or date-range predictions, inspired by SciCast.
*Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market that uses the USDC stablecoin.
*PredictIt is a prediction market for political and financial events.
*SciCast was a reputation-based combinatorial prediction market focusing on science and technology forecasting.

==Types==

=== Reputation-based ===
Some prediction websites, sometimes classified as prediction markets, do not involve betting real money but rather add to or subtract from a predictor&#x27;s reputation points based on the accuracy of a prediction. This incentive system may be better-suited than traditional prediction markets for niche or long-timeline questions. These include Manifold, Metaculus, and Good Judgment Open.

A 2006 study found that real-money prediction markets were significantly more accurate than play-money prediction markets for non-sports events.

===Combinatorial prediction markets===
A combinatorial prediction market is a type of prediction market where participants can make bets on combinations of outcomes. The advantage of making bets on combinations of outcomes is that, in theory, conditional information can be better incorporated into the market price.

One difficulty of combinatorial prediction markets is that the number of possible combinatorial trades scales exponentially with the number of normal trades. For example, a market with merely 100 binary contracts would have formula_1 possible combinations of contracts. These exponentially large data structures can be too large for a computer to keep track of, so there have been efforts to develop algorithms and rules to make the data more tractable.

=== Election prediction markets ===
Election prediction markets are a type of prediction market in which the ultimate values of the contracts being traded are based on the outcome of elections. The main purpose of an election stock market is to predict the election outcome, such as the share of the popular vote or share of seats each political party receives in a legislature or parliament.

Before World War II, election betting was widespread in the U.S., dating back to George Washington’s election and becoming organized by Lincoln&#x27;s era. Though often illegal, it operated openly through “betting commissioners” who held stakes and charged a 5% commission. New York was the hub, with activity shifting from poolrooms to the Curb Exchange (precursor to AMEX) and Wall Street offices. By the 1930s, wagers involved large sums from anonymous business and entertainment figures. In some elections, the volumes traded rivaled those of stocks and bonds, with daily odds reported in major newspapers like &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot;.

The CFTC has attempted to restrict election markets, arguing they resemble gaming rather than the financial derivatives it oversees. It previously allowed limited academic use, such as with PredictIt, but withdrew support in 2022 and became involved in litigation with the project. The CFTC also targeted Polymarket, a crypto-based prediction market, resulting in the company moving offshore and paying a $1.4 million fine.

In October 2024, prediction market Kalshi won a lawsuit against its regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, with a federal appeals court in Washington allowing it to revive the first fully regulated election prediction markets in the United States. Kalshi&#x27;s court victory over the CFTC opened the market for election markets.

<doc id="294500" wikidata="Q3055932" url="?curid=294500" title="Walter Reuther">
<text>Walter Philip Reuther (; September 1, 1907 – May 9, 1970) was an American leader of organized labor and civil rights activist who built the United Automobile Workers (UAW) into one of the most progressive labor unions in American history. He considered labor movements not as narrow special interest groups but as instruments to advance social justice and human rights in democratic societies. He leveraged the UAW&#x27;s resources and influence to advocate for workers&#x27; rights, civil rights, women&#x27;s rights, universal health care, public education, affordable housing, environmental stewardship and nuclear nonproliferation around the world. He believed in Swedish-style social democracy and societal change through nonviolent civil disobedience. He cofounded the AFL-CIO in 1955 with George Meany. He survived two attempted assassinations, including one at home where he was struck by a 12-gauge shotgun blast fired through his kitchen window. He was the fourth and longest serving president of the UAW, serving from 1946 until his death in 1970.

As the leader of five million autoworkers, including retirees and their families, Reuther was influential inside the Democratic Party. Following the Bay of Pigs in 1961, President John F. Kennedy sent Reuther to Cuba to negotiate a prisoner exchange with Fidel Castro. He was instrumental in spearheading the creation of the Peace Corps and in marshaling support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid, and the Fair Housing Act. He met weekly in 1964 and 1965 with President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House to discuss policies and legislation for the Great Society and War on Poverty. The Republican Party was wary of Reuther, leading presidential candidate Richard Nixon to say about John F. Kennedy during the 1960 election, &quot;I can think of nothing so detrimental to this nation than for any President to owe his election to, and therefore be a captive of, a political boss like Walter Reuther.&quot; Conservative politician Barry Goldwater declared that Reuther &quot;was more dangerous to our country than Sputnik or anything Soviet Russia might do.&quot;

A powerful ally of Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement, Reuther marched with King in Detroit, Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery, and Jackson. When King and others including children were jailed in Birmingham, Alabama, and King authored his famous Letter from Birmingham Jail, Reuther arranged $160,000 for the protestors&#x27; release. He also helped organize and finance the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, delivering remarks from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial shortly before King gave his historic &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech on the National Mall. An early supporter of Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers, he asked Robert F. Kennedy to visit and support Chavez. He served on the board of directors for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and was one of the founders of Americans for Democratic Action. A lifelong environmentalist, Reuther played a critical role in funding and organizing the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970. According to Denis Hayes, the principal national organizer of the first Earth Day, &quot;Without the UAW, the first Earth Day would have likely flopped!&quot;

Reuther was recognized by &quot;Time&quot; Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1995 by President Bill Clinton, who remarked at the ceremony, &quot;Walter Reuther was an American visionary so far ahead of his times that although he died a quarter of a century ago, our Nation has yet to catch up to his dreams.&quot;

== Early life and education ==

Reuther was born on September 1, 1907, in Wheeling, West Virginia, to Valentine and Anna (née Stocker) Reuther, who were German-Americans. His father Valentine was a horse-drawn beer wagon driver and Socialist union organizer who at age 11 had emigrated from Germany. Walter was one of five children, oldest to youngest: Ted, Walter, Roy, Victor, Christine. Valentine would facilitate debates every Sunday for his sons, training them to think on their feet about social issues of the day such as yellow journalism, child labor, women&#x27;s suffrage, and civil rights. Reuther later recalled, &quot;At my father&#x27;s knee we learned the philosophy of trade unionism. We got the struggles, the hopes and the aspirations of working people every day.&quot; As a child, he and Victor accompanied their father on a visit to a jail to meet Eugene V. Debs, who was being incarcerated for his pacifism during World War I.

The Reuthers were frugal and learned not to waste. To save money, Walter&#x27;s mother Anna would make underwear for her sons out of used flour sacks. When Valentine was partially blinded by an exploding bottle, Walter began doing odd jobs to bring in family income at the age of nine. He later dropped out of high school during his junior year and worked in a local factory to help support the family. He learned firsthand about inadequate worker safety when a 400-pound die that he and three other men were lifting fell and severed his big toe.

From an early age, the Reuther boys received lessons on racism. One day they saw local boys throwing rocks at black people being transported north through their hometown in open railway cars. Their father gave them a stern warning to never treat another human being like that. The Reuther boys never forgot that lesson, spending the rest of their lives fighting for racial and economic equality for all people.

=== Left home for Detroit ===
In 1927, at the age of 19, Reuther left Wheeling for Detroit and argued himself into an expert tool and die maker job at Ford Motor Company that required 25 years experience. The foreman was baffled that at his young age he could read blueprints and dies, becoming one of the highest paid mechanics in the factory. He finished high school while working at Ford and enrolled at Detroit City College, which is today known as Wayne State University. In 1932, he was fired for organizing a rally for Norman Thomas who was running for President of the United States as the nominee for the Socialist Party of America. His official Ford employment record states that he quit voluntarily, but Reuther himself maintained that he was fired for his increasingly visible socialist activities. Regardless, Walter and Victor decided it was the perfect time to fulfill their childhood dream and travel the world.

=== World tour ===
When Henry Ford retired the Model T in 1927, he sold the production mechanisms to the Soviet Union, and American workers who knew how to operate the equipment were needed. Walter and Victor were promised work teaching Soviet workers how to run the machines and assembly line. With that employment assurance, the brothers embarked on a three-year adventure, first bicycling through Europe, then working in the auto plant in Gorky, in the Soviet Union where the unheated factories were often 30–40 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. He frequently wrote letters to the &quot;Moscow Daily News&quot; criticizing the many inefficiencies associated with how the communists operated the plants.

After almost two years in the Soviet Union, the brothers travelled through Turkey, Iran, British India, and China. After crossing the East China Sea, they finished their Far East tour by bicycling throughout Japan. Finally, after being gone from home for almost three years, they found work for passage on the steamship &quot;SS President Harding&quot; to San Francisco and hurried back to Detroit where their brother Roy was already deeply involved with organizing autoworkers. Walter later stated the world tour taught him that &quot;all people long for the same basic human goals of a job with some degree of security, greater opportunity for their children, and of course, freedom. We felt we could make a contribution by helping American workers build strong and democratic labor unions. That&#x27;s why we went into the labor movement.&quot;

===Political affiliation===

Before joining the Democratic Party, Reuther was a member of the Socialist Party of America. Although Reuther always denied it, some, including J. Edgar Hoover, have suspected that at one time he was a member of the Communist Party. On this subject, Reuther said in 1938, &quot;I am not and never have been a member of the Communist Party nor a supporter of its policies nor subject to its control or influence in any way.&quot; Nevertheless, people have suspected that he may have paid dues to the Communist Party for some months in 1935–36 and one source listed him as attending a Communist Party planning meeting as late as February 1939. Reuther did cooperate with the Communists in the mid-1930s; this was the period of the Popular Front, and the Communist Party agreed with him on internal issues of the UAW; but his associations were with anti-Stalinist Socialists. Reuther remained active in the Socialist Party and in 1937 failed in his attempt to be elected to the Detroit City Council when the AFL and blacks opposed his CIO ticket. (Historian Martin Glaberman found proof of Reuther&#x27;s less-than-one-year CPUSA membership in the papers of UAW activist Nat Ganley.) However, impressed by the efforts by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to tackle inequality, he eventually joined the Democratic Party.

== United Automobile Workers ==
=== First victory against automobile companies ===

Upon returning from Europe to Detroit, Reuther hitchhiked to South Bend, Indiana, to attend the second annual convention as a delegate of the fledgling UAW. Upon his return he became president of newly formed Local 174 on Detroit&#x27;s west side and with brother Victor, led the first successful strike against the automotive giants at Kelsey Hayes, which supplied brake drums and wheels to Ford Motor Company. The main complaint was the speed-up of the assembly line was intolerable. Workers were losing limbs and even their own lives trying in vain to keep up with the ever-increasing speed of the assembly line. It was December 1936 when the workers pulled a surprise strike and sat down in the plant refusing to leave until management negotiated with their representative, Walter Reuther.

When management tried to enter the plant to remove the machinery, thousands of sympathizers swarmed the sidewalks and blocked the doorways. Ford needed those brake drums and wheels badly and after 10 days of striking the sides settled. The first major UAW victory to unionize the auto factories was won. Upon Reuther&#x27;s insistence, women won equal pay for equal work: 75 cents an hour. The speed-up of the assembly line was slowed down and the company could not fire a worker for joining the union. UAW Local 174&#x27;s membership expanded from 200 before the strike to 35,000 within the next year.

=== General Motors ===
In 1936, General Motors (GM) was the largest corporation in the world and held many plants in Flint, Michigan, about 60 miles north of Detroit. Reuther&#x27;s brother, Roy, was already in Flint drawing up strategy plans and organizing workers to shut down the automaker until it would recognize the rights of the workers to unionize. The strike began on New Year&#x27;s Eve, December 31, 1936, when the workers sat down in the plants and refused to leave. General Motors retaliated by turning off the heat in the plant.

In solidarity with the Flint strikers, Reuther led a strike at Detroit&#x27;s Fleetwood Plant, where bodies were made for GM&#x27;s luxury vehicle, the Cadillac. Support strikes were also called in Oakland, California; Pontiac, Michigan; and St. Louis, Missouri. Autoworkers around the nation engaged in action in support of the Flint sit-down strikers.

Back in Flint, the police tried to force the workers out of the plant in what became known as the &quot;Battle of Bulls Run.&quot; Over a hundred policemen attacked the pickets with tear gas and bullets, sending thirteen workers to the hospital with gunshot wounds. Victor manned the sound car and encouraged the workers to fight back, which they did by sling-shotting door hinges from the factory roof and turning fire hoses on the police in the 16-degree Fahrenheit winter night. Victor and Genora Johnson, a leader of the Women&#x27;s Brigade, took turns in the sound car exhorting the workers to stand their ground.

Michigan Governor Frank Murphy called in 2,000 members of the National Guard, not to force the workers out of the plants, but to keep the peace. After a brilliant move, the workers were able to gain control of the only plant in the country that made Chevrolet engines. Finally, 44 days later, General Motors was forced to recognize the workers&#x27; right to unionize and signed its first collective bargaining agreement with the fledgling UAW.

The Flint sit-down strike has become known as the Lexington and Valley Forge of American industrial unionism. Roy recalled, &quot;When the boys came out of the plants, I never saw a night like that and perhaps will never see it again. I liken it to a country experiencing independence, families reunited for the first time since the strike began, kids hanging onto daddy with tears of joy and happiness. It was a sea of humanity in which fears were no longer on the minds of the workers.&quot;

In 1950, Reuther negotiated and signed with Charlie Wilson, chief executive officer of General Motors, the Treaty of Detroit, an historic five-year labor contract that, in exchange for a commitment not to strike, gave rank-and-file workers better wages, health care, and pensions. At the time, Fortune Magazine wrote that the Treaty of Detroit “made the worker to an amazing degree a middle class member of a middle class society.”

=== Chrysler ===
Chrysler was next on the list of the young UAW. In March 1937, 60,000 Chrysler workers went on strike. When police started roughing up pickets and strikers, over 150,000 citizens gathered at Detroit&#x27;s downtown Cadillac Square where Reuther and others led them in protest. After a four-week strike, Chrysler followed General Motors’ lead and negotiated its first collective bargaining agreement with the UAW.

=== Ford Motor Company ===
Henry Ford had stated that he would never allow his workers to unionize. His main enforcer was Harry Bennett, who led a 3,000-man Security Department for Ford Motor Company, whose mandate was to intimidate, beat, and fire any worker who showed signs of favoring unionization. In 1932, when workers marched out of the giant Ford River Rouge Complex in protest of the speed-up of the assembly lines, they were attacked by Bennett&#x27;s armed men; five workers were shot dead and hundreds suffered injuries.
Barely a month after the Chrysler signing, Reuther got permission from the City of Dearborn to pass out handbills titled, &quot;Unionism, not Fordism&quot; on public property at Gate Four of the giant Ford River Rouge Complex. As he and three other UAW leaders climbed the stairs to the bridge, they were attacked by Bennett&#x27;s &quot;enforcers&quot; who severely beat them.

Reuther was instantly surrounded by at least a dozen men, knocked to the ground, kicked and punched in the head and body, picked up four feet parallel to the ground then slammed to the concrete repeatedly, then thrown and kicked down three flights of stairs. The pummeling continued as four or five men beat him in and out of parked cars, until a streetcar arrived with union women to pass out leaflets and the thugs turned their attention to viciously attack them.

Press photographers were attacked as well and their cameras confiscated but one camera was inconspicuously thrown into a convertible and the next day, the &quot;Battle of the Overpass,&quot; was national news.

The beatings taken by the union organizers in the long run hurt Henry Ford more, as national sentiment turned against him. &quot;Time&quot; magazine published the photographs with descriptions of how the union men and women were mercilessly beaten by Henry Ford&#x27;s paid thugs. Ford retaliated against &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, and &quot;Fortune&quot; magazines by withdrawing all advertising.

It took four more years, but finally, in 1941, Henry Ford signed his first agreement with the UAW. Shortly after, Henry Ford told Walter Reuther: &quot;It was one of the most sensible things Harry Bennett ever did when he got the UAW into this plant.&quot; Reuther inquired, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ford replied, &quot;Well, you&#x27;ve been fighting General Motors and the Wall Street crowd. Now you&#x27;re in here and we&#x27;ve given you a union shop and more than you got out of them. That puts you on our side, doesn&#x27;t it? We can fight General Motors and Wall Street together, eh?&quot;

In the 1950s, Reuther and Henry Ford II, CEO of Ford, toured a state-of-the-art engine plant in Cleveland. As they walked about the plant, Ford gestured to the cutting-edge, automated machines, saying, &quot;Walter, how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues?&quot; Without missing a beat, Reuther famously replied: &quot;Henry, how are you going to get them to buy your cars?&quot;

=== &quot;500 Planes a Day&quot; ===
In 1940, in the midst of World War II, the United States was producing fighter planes to help the allies in their war against Hitler&#x27;s aggression. The production was slow, inadequate, and threatening the security of the Allies. The US planned to construct new manufacturing plants specifically to produce more planes. That plan would have taken two years to begin production. The Allies did not have that time to spare. In response, Reuther proposed &quot;to transform the entire unused capacity of the auto industry into one huge plane production unit capable of turning out 500 Planes a Day.&quot; After getting the support of workers, he publicly announced the &quot;Reuther Plan: 500 Planes a Day,&quot; shortly before Christmas, 1940. He said, during a national radio address on December 28, 1940:

In London they are huddled in the subways praying for aid from America. In America we are huddled over blueprints praying that Hitler will be obliging enough to postpone an &quot;all out&quot; attack on England for another two years until new plants finally begin to turn out engines and aircraft. We believe that without disturbing present aircraft plant production schedules we can supplement them by turning out 500 planes a day of a single standard fighting model by the use of idle automotive capacity. . . . England&#x27;s battles, it used to be said, were won on the playing fields of Eton. America&#x27;s can be won on the assembly lines of Detroit. Give England planes and there will be no need to give her men.

A week after receiving the plan, on December 30, 1940, President Roosevelt wrote William S. Knudsen, chairman of the War Production Board, &quot;It is well worthwhile to give a good deal of attention to this (Reuther) program.&quot; Three days later on January 2, 1941, Reuther met with President Roosevelt at the White House to discuss the possibility of implementing his plan for 500 Planes a Day.

General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler all opposed the Reuther Plan because they wanted the government to build new plane and tank factories that could be sold to them at giveaway prices after the war. They also disliked that labor had the audacity to stick their nose into production, which they felt was management&#x27;s exclusive domain. Alfred P. Sloan, chairman of General Motors, scoffed at the idea, stating, &quot;only about 10 to 15% of the machinery and equipment in an automobile factory can be utilized for the production of special defense material.&quot;

After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, many of Reuther&#x27;s proposals were implemented. Detroit&#x27;s automobile plants produced planes and tanks in mass volume and became known as the center of the Arsenal of Democracy, which gave the Allies a decisive advantage to win the war. By 1943, Chrysler President, K. T. Keller, reported that his company had converted 89% of its machine tools to wartime production, leading Washington Post publisher, Phil Graham, to state that meant Reuther was 89% right. At the war&#x27;s end, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Reuther was right on track. Compared with many industrialists that sat back and hugged profits and the aimless agencies of Washington, the red-headed labor leader exhibited atomic spirit of action. He never let up.&quot; In 1953, President Eisenhower wrote in a letter to Reuther, &quot;When I last addressed a CIO Convention, I came to thank you for your magnificent performance in World War II in supplying the planes and tanks and ships and arms. You did your job, and you did it well.&quot;

=== Elected UAW president ===
After the war ended in 1945, Reuther proved he would be a different type of labor leader when he led a strike challenging GM to increase workers wages by 30% without increasing the price of their new cars. Worker pay had been restricted during World War II and Reuther sought to get them a raise but not at the cost of increased inflation. Historically, when workers won a pay increase, the company would pass on the expense to their consumers. GM refused the pay increase and after a 113 day strike, the sides settled on an eighteen and a half cent hourly raise. Reuther&#x27;s bold collective bargaining leadership in this strike catapulted him into the union&#x27;s top position.On March 27, 1946, Reuther won the election and became the president of the UAW in a very close race, defeating incumbent UAW president R. J. Thomas by a mere 124 votes, out of almost 9,000 cast. The new UAW president pledged his vision of &quot;a labor movement whose philosophy is to fight for the welfare of the public at large.&quot; One of his first acts as president was to fight to integrate the American Bowling League, which had previously excluded black bowlers. He was a new kind of leader who viewed the labor movement as &quot;an instrument for social change.&quot;

==== Salary ====
Although presidents of much smaller unions were making 3 or 4 times his salary, Reuther purposely kept his salary low to stay in touch, and show solidarity, with UAW members he represented. He never made an annual salary of more than $31,000. Author David Halberstam writes: &quot;His life was not about material things. The constant success of the union was reward enough.&quot;

=== Expelling Communists from organized labor ===

The following 18 months after Reuther&#x27;s election win, bitter battles erupted inside the UAW as Communist-backers of R. J. Thomas had a two-thirds majority on the UAW&#x27;s Executive Board. One observer noted, &quot;The Commies threw everything but their hammer and sickle at Walter.&quot; In November 1947, at the next UAW national convention, this time Reuther won the election overwhelmingly, severely weakening the Communist&#x27;s hold on the union&#x27;s leadership. &quot;Life&quot; magazine reported that Reuther&#x27;s victory was &quot;the biggest setback of all time for the Communists in the American Labor Movement.&quot;

=== President of Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) ===
Reuther became president of the CIO in 1952 until its merger with the AFL in 1955, and continued as head of the UAW until his death in 1970. As president of the CIO, Reuther sought to remove officers from Communist-dominated unions within the CIO, leading Hubert Humphrey to write, &quot;Communist infiltration of the CIO was a direct threat to the survival of all of our country&#x27;s democratic institutions. The CIO&#x27;s victory over the Communist party was a significant victory for our nation.&quot; In response, Trud, a Soviet newspaper, called Reuther a &quot;traitor and strikebreaker&quot; and a favorite of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Republican Party called Reuther &quot;the most dangerous man in America and a Communist.&quot; Despite removing Communists from the labor movement, J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, never stopped suspecting Reuther to be a Communist for working in Russia and having early associations with Communists.

In 1959, at the request of the Department of State, Reuther met with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who was visiting the U.S. They discussed, among other things, capitalism versus communism, organized labor, and US-Russia relations. The meeting happened in San Francisco and was front-page international news.

=== Collective bargaining ===

As president of the UAW, Reuther negotiated contracts that included unprecedented standard-of-living increases for automobile workers. Such increases include annual raises based on productivity advances, cost-of-living increases, supplementary unemployment benefits, early-retirement options, and health and welfare benefits.

He employed a strategy called &quot;pattern bargaining&quot; against the Big Three automobile manufacturers, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler. He would first target a company that seemed most likely to accept his bargaining objective. If that target company refused to offer concessions, Reuther would threaten a strike to halt production at its plants only while allowing production operations at its competitors&#x27; plants to go uninterrupted. As a result, the target company would accept Reuther&#x27;s demands to prevent its competitors from absorbing its sales and market share. Once he secured the initial agreement, he would use it as a pattern against the other automobile companies, threatening to strike if they too did not match the same terms to which the initial target company agreed. Reuther employed pattern bargaining to leverage competition among automobile manufacturers, maximize the influence of labor, and reduce the frequency of costly strikes.

== Ideas, activism, and political stances ==

=== Peace Corps ===
In 1950, Reuther proposed, in an article titled, &quot;A Proposal for a Total Peace Offensive&quot;, that the United States establish a voluntary agency for young Americans to be sent around the world to fulfill humanitarian and development objectives. Subsequently, throughout the 1950s, Reuther gave speeches to the following effect:I have been saying for a long time that I believe the more young Americans who are trained to join with other young people in the world to be sent abroad with slide rule, textbook, and medical kit to help people help themselves with the tools of peace, the fewer young people will need to be sent with guns and weapons of war.In August 1960, following the 1960 Democratic National Convention, Walter Reuther visited John F. Kennedy at the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport to discuss Kennedy&#x27;s platform and staffing of a future administration. It was there that Reuther got Kennedy to commit to creating the executive agency that would become the Peace Corps. Under Reuther&#x27;s leadership, the United Auto Workers had earlier that summer put together a policy platform that included a &quot;youth peace corps&quot; to be sent to developing nations. Subsequently, at the urging of Reuther, John F. Kennedy announced the idea for such an organization on October 14, 1960, at a late-night campaign speech at the University of Michigan.

=== Civil rights activism ===

Reuther was a strong supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. He marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. in Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery, and Jackson and when King and others were jailed in Birmingham, Alabama, and King authored his famous Letter from Birmingham Jail, Reuther arranged $160,000 for the protestors&#x27; release. He also helped organize and finance the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, delivering remarks from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial shortly before King gave his historic &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. He served on the board of directors for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Under his leadership, the UAW donated $75,000 in 1954 to help underwrite the NAACP&#x27;s efforts—led by Thurgood Marshall—before the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education. According to King, Reuther sent letters to all of his local unions in 1957, requesting members to attend and provide financial support to the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom in Washington, D.C.
On the 25th anniversary of the UAW, King wrote a letter to Reuther, congratulating him on his successes and observing:More than anyone else in America, you stand out as the shining symbol of democratic trade unionism. Through trials, efforts and your unswerving devotion to humanitarian causes, you have made life more meaningful for millions of working people. Through moments of difficulty and strong obstacles, you have stood firm for what you believe, knowing that in the long run &#x27;Truth crushed to earth will rise again.&#x27; As I have heard you say, the true measure of a man is where he stands in moments of challenge and controversy, when the only consolation he gains is the quiet whisper of an inner voice saying there are things so eternally true and significant that they are worth dying for, if necessary. You have demonstrated over the years that you can stand up in moments of challenge and controversy. One day all of America will be proud of your achievements, and will record your work as one of the glowing epics of our heritage.

In the early 1930s, Reuther first challenged racism as a student at what is now Wayne State University. When a local hotel, which had agreed with the college to let students use its swimming pool, refused to let blacks swim, he organized a picket line. The protest surrounded the block. As a result, the hotel closed its pool to all students. In a 2013 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, President Barack Obama said, &quot;When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasn&#x27;t just folks who believed in racial equality; it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot. It was Walter Reuther and the UAW coming down here because they understood that if there are some workers who are not getting a fair deal then ultimately that’s going to undercut their ability to get a fair deal.&quot;

==== Walk to Freedom, 1963 ====
The Walk to Freedom was a mass march during the Civil Rights Movement on June 23, 1963, in Detroit, Michigan. The purpose of the demonstration was to protest racism, segregation, and the brutality inflicted upon civil rights activists in the South as well as the discrimination facing African-Americans in the North such as inequality in hiring, wages, education, and housing. In some ways, it was considered a dress rehearsal for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which was scheduled for two months later. An estimated 125,000 people attended and it was the largest civil rights demonstration in the nation&#x27;s history up to that date.
Reuther mobilized support for the protest and donated office space at the UAW&#x27;s headquarters Solidarity House for Martin Luther King Jr. to organize the event. Along with others, including King, Reuther marched down Woodward Avenue and delivered remarks afterwards at Cobo Hall. It was there that King delivered his first version of his &quot;I Have a Dream,&quot; speech, having penned it, at least partially, inside his office at Solidarity House.

==== March on Washington, 1963 ====

The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom was held in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, August 28, 1963. The protest sought to advocate for the civil and economic rights of African Americans. Along with the Big Six and three white religious leaders, Reuther helped organize the march. Originally, the march was planned to take place outside of the Capitol Building. Reuther, however, persuaded the other organizers to move the march to the Lincoln Memorial. He believed the Lincoln Memorial would be less threatening to Congress and the occasion would be more appropriate underneath the gaze of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s statue. The committee, notably Bayard Rustin, agreed to move the site on the condition that Reuther pay for a $19,000 sound system so that everyone on the National Mall could hear the speakers and musicians. 
Reuther and the UAW financed bus transportation for 5,000 of its rank-and-file members, providing the largest single contingent from any organization. The UAW also paid for and brought thousands of signs for marchers to carry. Among other things, the signs read: &quot;There Is No Halfway House on the Road to Freedom&quot;, &quot;Equal Rights and Jobs NOW&quot;, &quot;UAW Supports Freedom March&quot;, &quot;in Freedom we are Born, in Freedom we must Live&quot;, and &quot;Before we&#x27;ll be a Slave, we&#x27;ll be Buried in our Grave&quot;.

Reuther was the most prominent white organizer scheduled to speak. In his remarks, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he urged Americans to pressure their politicians to act to address racial injustices. He said:American democracy is on trial in the eyes of the world… We cannot successfully preach democracy in the world unless we first practice democracy at home. American democracy will lack the moral credentials and be both unequal to and unworthy of leading the forces of freedom against the forces of tyranny unless we take bold, affirmative, adequate steps to bridge the moral gap between American democracy&#x27;s noble promises and its ugly practices in the field of civil rights.

According to Irving Bluestone, who was standing near the platform while Reuther delivered his remarks, he overheard two black women talking. One asked, &quot;Who is that white man?&quot; The other replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t you know him? That&#x27;s the white Martin Luther King.&quot;

After the march, the civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the White House to discuss civil rights legislation. During the meeting, Reuther described to Kennedy how he was framing the civil rights issue to business leaders in Detroit, saying, &quot;Look, you can&#x27;t escape the problem. And there are two ways of resolving it; either by reason or riots.&quot; Reuther continued, &quot;Now the civil war that this is gonna trigger is not gonna be fought at Gettysburg. It&#x27;s gonna to be fought in your backyard, in your plant, where your kids are growing up.&quot;
==== Selma voting rights movement and &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, 1965 ====

On March 9, 1965, two days after Bloody Sunday, where civil rights marchers were beaten by state police at the Edmond Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, Reuther sent a telegram to President Johnson, reading in part:Americans of all religious faiths, of all political persuasions, and from every section of our Nation are deeply shocked and outraged at the tragic events in Selma Ala., and they look to the Federal Government as the only possible source to protect and guarantee the exercise of constitutional rights, which is being denied and destroyed by the Dallas County law enforcement agents and the Alabama State troops under the direction of Governor George Wallace.

Under these circumstances, Mr President, I join in urging you to take immediate and appropriate steps including the use of Federal marshals and troops if necessary, so that the full exercise of constitutional rights including free assembly and free speech be fully protected.

Sunday&#x27;s spectacle of tear gas and night sticks, whips, and electric cattle prods used against defenseless citizens demonstrating to secure their constitutional right to register and vote as American citizens was an outrage against all decency. This shameful brutality by law enforcing agents makes a mockery of Americans’ concepts of justice and provides effective ammunition to Communist propaganda and our enemies around the world who would weaken and destroy us. Following the death of Unitarian Universalist minister James Reeb, a memorial service was held at the Brown&#x27;s Chapel AME Church on March 15. Among those who addressed the packed congregation were Reuther, King, and some clergymen. A picture of King, Reuther, Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos and others in Selma for Reeb&#x27;s memorial service appeared on the cover of Life magazine on March 26, 1965. After the memorial service, upon getting permission from the courts, the leaders and attendees marched from the church to the Dallas County Courthouse in Selma.

==== Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers, 1965 ====
In December 1965, Reuther visited Cesar Chavez and the striking grape growers in Delano, California. Two months earlier, Reuther&#x27;s brother and colleague, Roy, had visited the striking farmworkers. Upon returning from his visit, Roy urged Walter to support Chavez. At that time, Chavez&#x27;s struggle for workers&#x27; rights was little known to the American public, but Reuther&#x27;s visit garnered national media attention, making it difficult for the growers to ignore the striking grape pickers. During the trip, Reuther marched with Chavez and his fellow strikers, carrying picket signs reading &quot;Huelga&quot;. Reuther also spoke to a packed union hall, declaring, &quot;This is not your strike, this is our strike!&quot; He pledged that the UAW would provide $7,500 per month to the United Farm Workers&#x27; strike fund for the duration of the strike.

Upon returning to Detroit, Reuther contacted Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was on the Senate Labor Committee, requesting that Kennedy visit Chavez in Delano to learn about and support the farmworkers. Kennedy obliged, ultimately becoming the most visible supporter of the farmworkers&#x27; movement. Reuther visited Chavez many times, including once during Chavez&#x27;s hunger strike. During that visit, Reuther made a $50,000 donation to Chavez&#x27;s struggle to which Chavez said, &quot;Walter, you have given me great confidence.&quot; Reuther replied, &quot;You will prevail for your cause is just.&quot; In honor of the Reuther brothers&#x27; early and sustained support, the United Farm Workers named a building at their Delano headquarters the &quot;Roy Reuther Administration Building&quot;.

==== March Against Fear, 1966 ====
Following the shooting of civil rights activist James Meredith, the first African-American to attend the segregated University of Mississippi, Reuther and his wife May traveled from Chicago to Jackson, Mississippi, to march with King and his wife Coretta, among other civil rights activists. Reuther brought 10 buses full of union supporters.

==== Memphis sanitation strike, 1968 ====
On April 8, four days after King&#x27;s assassination, Reuther marched with Coretta Scott King and others in Memphis, Tennessee, in support of a peaceful resolution of the city&#x27;s sanitation strike. In addition, Reuther donated $50,000 from the UAW to the striking sanitation workers, which was the largest financial contribution by any outside source.

=== Environmentalism ===
Reuther sought to build an environmental movement made up of all classes of society to address social, ecological, aesthetic, and resource-conservation issues. In 1965, the UAW organized a &quot;United Action for Clean Water Conference&quot; in Detroit, where Reuther called for the &quot;beginning of a massive mobilization of citizens ... of a popular crusade not only for clean water, but also for cleaning up the atmosphere, the highways, the junkyards and the slums and for creating a total living environment worthy of free men&quot;. In 1967, three years before the first Earth Day, Reuther established the Department of Conservation and Resource Development, later headed by Olga Madar, to combat pollution, including automobile emissions. In 1968, speaking at the annual conference of the Water Pollution Control Federation, Reuther stated: &quot;If we continue to destroy our living environment by polluting our streams and poisoning our air ... We may be the first civilization in the history of man that will have suffocated and been strangled in the waste of its material affluence—compounded by social indifference and social neglect.&quot; At the annual UAW convention in 1970 in Atlantic City, Reuther said: &quot;Because industry has for so long polluted the environment of the plants in which we work and has now created an environmental crisis of catastrophic proportions in the communities in which we live, the UAW will insist on discussing the implications of this crisis at the bargaining table.&quot;

==== Earth Day ====
Reuther made the first donation to support the first Earth Day in 1970 in the amount of $2,000. Under his leadership, the UAW also funded telephone capabilities for organizers to communicate and coordinate with each other from across the United States. The UAW also financed, printed, and mailed all of the literature and other materials for the first Earth Day and mobilized its membership to participate in the public demonstrations across the country. According to Denis Hayes, the chief national coordinator of the first Earth Day, &quot;The UAW was by far the largest contributor to the first Earth Day&quot; and &quot;Without the UAW, the first Earth Day would have likely flopped!&quot; Hayes further said, &quot;Walter’s presence at our first press conference utterly changed the dynamics of the coverage—we had instant credibility.&quot; Following Reuther&#x27;s death less than one month after the first Earth Day, the organizers of Environmental Action, the key group that organized the first Earth Day, dedicated a book containing a collection of speeches from Earth Day to Reuther, saying &quot;We would like to pay tribute to Walter Reuther, a friend and ally in the movement for peace, justice, and a livable environment. We admired his courage and his foresight, and we are deeply grateful for the help he gave us.&quot;

==== Redwood National Park ====
Reuther supported the establishment of Redwood National Park, writing President Johnson in 1966:The preservation of a significant stand of these magnificent trees will be a truly monumental step, in the implementation of the &#x27;Great Society.&#x27; Several months ago I asked our Recreation Department to gather the facts regarding the size and location of a Redwood National Park. After careful consideration of the results of this study, the UAW supports the creation of a Redwood National Park of some 90,000 acres ... This proposal contains virgin redwood forests of unequaled magnitude, ecological conditions most advantageous to redwood preservation, outstanding panoramic views, a long ocean-front beach, wildlife concentrations of major size, as well as a number of wilderness watersheds.President Johnson wrote Reuther back, stating that his administration would establish Redwood National Park come hell or high water.

=== Filibuster ===
In 1957, during a speech before the annual convention of the NAACP, Reuther coined the United States Senate &quot;the graveyard of civil rights legislation&quot;, and called for the abolition of the body&#x27;s filibuster.

== Assassination attempts ==
In April 1938, two masked gunmen attempted to abduct Reuther at a party he was hosting. However, one guest managed to flee and alert the authorities, leading to their arrest. At the trial, the defense argued that Reuther staged the entire event as a publicity stunt. Links between the gunmen and Harry Bennett (a union-busting enemy of the UAW) were not disclosed to the jury.

On April 20, 1948, Reuther barely survived a double-barrel shotgun blast that ripped through his kitchen window as he was preparing a late evening snack. As the gunshot went off at 9:48 pm, EST, Reuther happened to turn toward his wife, and was hit in his right arm instead of the chest and heart. Four slugs shattered his right arm into 150 pieces of bone. Another slug pierced his back and exited out his stomach. The assailant “fled in a bright red four-door Ford sedan, police said.” Reuther, who did not lose consciousness, cursed his attacker as he was initially being treated by his next-door-neighbor, a doctor, as he lay on the kitchen floor. “‘Those dirty sons of bitches!’ Reuther cried. ‘They have to shoot a man in the back. They won’t come out in the open and fight.’” As doctors fought to save his life, he became infected with malaria and hepatitis from blood transfusions. Through months of therapy, he regained partial use of his right arm, but for the rest of his life had to train himself to write and shake hands with his left hand. When Attorney General Tom Clark requested J. Edgar Hoover to get the FBI to investigate the shooting, Hoover refused, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to send in the FBI every time some nigger woman gets raped.&quot; The shooting was never solved.
Thirteen months after the attack, Reuther&#x27;s brother Victor was almost killed by a similar shooting from a double-barrel shotgun. The blast traveled through his living room window and hit him in the face, throat, and chest. Victor&#x27;s right eye had been shot out and had to be removed. Victor said, &quot;The attack on me was a way of serving notice to Walter. &#x27;We didn&#x27;t get you yet, but we&#x27;re still around.&#x27;&quot; The shooting of Victor was also never solved.

In the wake of both shootings, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote: &quot;It seems unthinkable that the police have never been able to discover who shot Walter Reuther and because of that, in all probability, the same person perhaps has felt he could get away with shooting another brother. … [W]e have a right to protect men who are working in the interests of their fellow men.&quot;

== Death ==
On May 9, 1970, Walter Reuther, his wife May, architect Oscar Stonorov, Reuther&#x27;s bodyguard William Wolfman, pilot George O. Evans and co-pilot Joseph U. Karaffa were killed when their chartered Learjet 23 crashed in flames at 9:33 p.m. Eastern Time. The plane, arriving from Detroit in rain and fog, was on final approach to Pellston Regional Airport in Pellston, Michigan, near the UAW&#x27;s recreational and educational facility at Black Lake, Michigan. The National Transportation Safety Board discovered that the plane&#x27;s altimeter was missing parts, some incorrect parts were installed, and one of its parts had been installed upside down, leading some to speculate that Reuther may have been murdered. Reuther had been subjected earlier to two attempted assassinations and a similar near-crash in a small plane in 1969.

Journalist Michael Parenti wrote, &quot;Reuther&#x27;s demise appears as part of a truncation of liberal and radical leadership that included the deaths of four national figures: President John Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, and Senator Robert Kennedy.&quot;

=== Funeral ===
Reuther&#x27;s funeral was held on May 15, 1970, at Ford Auditorium in Detroit, Michigan. An estimated 3,400 people were in attendance. Among others, Coretta Scott King eulogized:

Walter Reuther was to black people, the most widely known and respected white labor leader in the nation. He was there when the storm clouds were thick. We remember him in Montgomery. He was in Birmingham. He marched with us in Selma, and Jackson, Mississippi, and in Washington. ... Only yesterday, there he was again in Charleston, South Carolina, the leader of a million and a half workers giving personal support to a strike of only 400 black women. ... He was a big man, so of course he had enemies and detractors. He had the courage to be with the minority when it was right. He was a simple man in his personal life, a rare quality in these flamboyant times ... but if his ways were simple, his ideas were grand. He aroused the imagination of millions. ... He was fighting the fight of the whole world.

== Personal life ==

Walter and May Reuther were married on March 13, 1936, after meeting on a streetcar in Detroit only six weeks earlier. They had two daughters, Linda born in 1942 and Elisabeth in 1947.

Reuther led a simple, austere lifestyle. He neither smoked nor drank alcohol because he felt it sapped a person&#x27;s vitality. For his daily lunch in his office he had the same menu: a sandwich and a cup of tea. He was an early riser. Author William Manchester wrote that Reuther&#x27;s associates saw him as a “true ascetic.”

To relax he liked to hike, fish and play tennis. His favorite music was German Lieder, Classical, Spirituals and Union Songs. Although sometimes perceived as rigid with no sense of humor, Reuther&#x27;s colleague and friend Irving Bluestone said: &quot;That wasn&#x27;t true at all. He was a very easy person to work with and be with. He had a good sense of humor and could laugh at himself. And occasionally, when he was excited enough, he would use profanity just like anyone else coming out of the shop.&quot;

Reuther enjoyed being and working outdoors in nature. Whether building a fish ladder for the trout underneath their bridge or planting a Japanese Garden for May that she could view outside their bedroom window, he enjoyed and relaxed by working on outdoor projects on his Paint Creek property, located outside Rochester, Michigan. He and his daughter Lisa planted an arboretum, including over 50 types of trees, at their Paint Creek home. He was an expert woodworker and built much of the furniture for their home with his own hands. After the assassination attempt in 1948, which shattered his arm in 150 pieces, he rehabilitated his arm by squeezing a hard rubber ball and pushing out the walls to build their Paint Creek home from what had been a one-room cottage. He remarked, “I got a good house and a good hand, all for the same money.”

May was Walter&#x27;s sounding board and close advisor throughout his public life. May was a teacher and involved in organizing a teachers’ union. Early on she was making $60 a week of which she gave most to help organize auto workers into the fledgling UAW. She soon gave up her teaching career to become Walter&#x27;s full-time secretary, earning $15 per week. She was active in many charities and programs to uplift the community. May marched side-by-side with Walter in the civil rights struggles in Selma and elsewhere. She hosted Eleanor Roosevelt at their Paint Creek home. She also served as president of the PTA at their daughter&#x27;s school. After the assassination attempt on Walter&#x27;s life in 1948, May decided to spend most of her time at home trying to give their two daughters as normal a life as possible; although, the family had bodyguards and attack dogs living with them the rest of their lives.

<text>Lucia of Syracuse ( – 304 AD), also called Saint Lucia () and better known as Saint Lucy, was a Roman Christian martyr who died during the Diocletianic Persecution. She is venerated as a saint in Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Christianity. She is one of eight women (including the Virgin Mary) explicitly commemorated by Catholics in the Canon of the Mass. Her traditional feast day, known in Europe as Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day, is observed by Western Christians on 13 December. Lucia of Syracuse was honored in the Middle Ages and remained a well-known saint in early modern England. She is one of the best known virgin martyrs, along with Agatha of Sicily, Agnes of Rome, Cecilia of Rome, and Catherine of Alexandria.

==Sources==
The oldest record of her story comes from the fifth-century &quot;Acts of the Martyrs&quot;. The single fact upon which various accounts agree is that a disappointed suitor accused Lucy of being a Christian, and she was executed in Syracuse, Sicily, in 304 AD, during the Diocletianic Persecution. Her veneration spread to Rome, and by the sixth century to the whole Church. The oldest archaeological evidence comes from the Greek inscriptions from the Catacombs of St. John in Syracuse. Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s &quot;Legenda Aurea&quot; was the most widely read version of the Lucy legend in the Middle Ages. In medieval accounts, Saint Lucy&#x27;s eyes were gouged out prior to her execution.
The most ancient archaeological traces attributable to the cult of Saint Lucia have been brought back to Sicily, particularly in Syracuse, and are preserved in the archaeological museums of the city.

==Life==
All the details of her life are the conventional ones associated with female martyrs of the early fourth century. John Henry Blunt views her story as a Christian romance similar to the Acts of other virgin martyrs.

According to the traditional story, Lucy was born to rich and noble parents in 283. Her father was of Roman origin, but died when she was five years old, leaving Lucy and her mother without a protective guardian. Her mother&#x27;s name, Eutychia, seems to indicate that she came from a Greek background.

Like many of the early martyrs, Lucy had consecrated her virginity to God, and she hoped to distribute her dowry to the poor. However, Eutychia, not knowing of Lucy&#x27;s promise, and suffering from a bleeding disorder, feared for Lucy&#x27;s future. She arranged Lucy&#x27;s marriage to a young man of a wealthy pagan family.
Saint Agatha had been martyred 52 years before, during the Decian persecution. Her shrine at Catania, less than from Syracuse, attracted a number of pilgrims; many miracles were reported to have happened through her intercession. Eutychia was persuaded to make a pilgrimage to Catania, in hopes of a cure. While there, St. Agatha came to Lucy in a dream and told her that because of her faith, her mother would be cured and that Lucy would be the glory of Syracuse, as she was of Catania. With her mother cured, Lucy took the opportunity to persuade her mother to allow her to distribute a great part of her riches among the poor.

Eutychia suggested that the sums would make a good bequest, but Lucy countered, &quot;...whatever you give away at death for the Lord&#x27;s sake you give because you cannot take it with you. Give now to the true Savior, while you are healthy, whatever you intended to give away at your death.&quot;

News that the patrimony and jewels were being distributed came to Lucy&#x27;s betrothed, who denounced her to Paschasius, the Governor of Syracuse. Paschasius ordered her to burn a sacrifice to the emperor&#x27;s image. When she refused, Paschasius sentenced her to be defiled in a brothel.

The Christian tradition states that when the guards came to take her away, they could not move her even when they hitched her to a team of oxen. Bundles of wood were then heaped about her and set on fire, but would not burn. Finally, she met her death by the sword thrust into her throat.
Absent in the early narratives and traditions, at least until the fifteenth century, is the story of Lucia tortured by eye-gouging. According to later accounts, before she died, she foretold the punishment of Paschasius and the speedy end of the persecution, adding that Diocletian would reign no more and Maximian would meet his end. This so angered Paschasius that he ordered the guards to remove her eyes. Another version has Lucy taking her own eyes out in order to discourage a persistent suitor who admired them. When her body was prepared for burial in the family mausoleum it was discovered that her eyes had been miraculously restored. This is one of the reasons that Lucy is the patron saint of those with eye illnesses.

==Veneration==

The earliest evidence of Lucy’s veneration is the grave stele of Euskia, which was discovered in the catacombs of Syracuse, Sicily and is now housed in the Museo archeologico regionale Paolo Orsi. Euskia was a 25-year-old woman who died on St Lucy’s Day in the late 300s or early 400s. By the sixth century, her story was sufficiently widespread that she appears in the procession of virgins in the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna and in the Sacramentary of Pope Gregory I. She is also commemorated in the ancient Roman Martyrology. St. Aldhelm (English, died in 709) and later the Venerable Bede (English, died in 735) attest that her popularity had already spread to England, where her festival was kept in England until the Protestant Reformation, as a holy day of the second rank in which no work but tillage or the like was allowed.

Lucy is honored in the Catholic Church, in the Church of England, in the Episcopal Church, and in the Lutheran Church on 13 December.

The monk Sigebert of Gembloux (1030–1112) wrote a mid-eleventh-century &quot;passio&quot;, to support a local cult of Lucy at Metz.

The General Roman Calendar formerly had a commemoration of Saints Lucy and Geminianus on 16 September. This was removed in 1969, as a duplication of the feast of her &quot;dies natalis&quot; on 13 December and because the Geminianus in question, mentioned in the &quot;Passio&quot; of Saint Lucy, seems to be a fictitious figure, unrelated to the Geminianus whose feast is on 31 January.

===Relics===

Sigebert of Gembloux, in his &quot;sermo de Sancta Lucia&quot;, chronicled that her body lay undisturbed in Sicily for 400 years, before Faroald II, Duke of Spoleto, captured the island and transferred the body to Corfinium in Abruzzo, Italy. From there it was removed by the Emperor Otho I in 972 to Metz and deposited in the church of St. Vincent. It was from this shrine that an arm of the saint was taken to the monastery of Luitburg in the Diocese of Speyer – an incident celebrated by Sigebert in verse.

The subsequent history of the relics is not clear. According to Umberto Benigni, Stephen II (768) sent the relics of St. Lucy to Constantinople for safety against the Saracen incursions. On their capture of Constantinople in 1204, the French found some relics attributed to Saint Lucy in the city, and Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice, secured them for the monastery of St. George at Venice. In 1513 the Venetians presented to Louis XII of France the saint&#x27;s head, which he deposited in the cathedral church of Bourges. Another account, however, states that the head was brought to Bourges from Rome, where it had been transferred during the time when the relics rested in Corfinium.

Parts of the body are present in Sicily in particular in Syracuse, which has preserved them from antiquity.
The remainder of the relics remain in Venice: they were transferred to the church of San Geremia when the church of Santa Lucia was demolished in 1861 to make way for the new railway terminus. A century later, on 7 November 1981, thieves stole all her bones, except her head. Police recovered them five weeks later, on her feast day. Other parts of the corpse have found their way to Rome, Naples, Verona, Lisbon, Milan, as well as Germany and France.

==Patronage==
Lucy&#x27;s Latin name &quot;Lucia&quot; shares a root (&quot;luc-&quot;) with the Latin word for light, &quot;&quot;. A number of traditions incorporate symbolic meaning of St. Lucy as the bearer of light in the darkness of winter, her feast day being 13 December. Because some versions of her story relate that her eyes were removed, either by herself or by her persecutors, she is the patroness saint of the blind.

She is also the patron saint of ophthalmologists, authors, cutlers, glaziers, laborers, martyrs, peasants, saddlers, salesmen, stained glass workers, photogrammetry, and of Perugia, Italy. She is invoked against hemorrhages, dysentery, diseases of the eye, and throat infections.

St. Lucy is the patroness of Syracuse in Sicily, Italy. At the Piazza Duomo in Syracuse, the church of Santa Lucia alla Badia used to house the painting &quot;Burial of St. Lucy&quot; by Caravaggio. But it is now housed in the church of Santa Lucia al Sepolcro in Syracuse. She is also the patron saint of the coastal town of Olón, Ecuador, which celebrates with a week-long festival culminating on the feast day 13 December. She is also the patron saint of the town of Guane, Santander, Colombia.

The Caribbean island of Saint Lucia, one of the Windward Islands in the Lesser Antilles, is named after her.

==Iconography==

The emblem of eyes on a cup or plate apparently reflects popular devotion to her as protector of sight, because of her name, Lucia (from the Latin word &quot;lux&quot; which means &quot;light&quot;). In paintings St. Lucy is frequently shown holding her eyes on a golden plate. Lucy was represented in Gothic art holding a dish with two eyes on it. She also holds the palm branch, symbol of martyrdom and victory over evil. Other symbolic images include a lamp, dagger, sword or two oxen.

==In literature==
===Dante===
In Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; Lucy first appears in Canto 2 of &quot;Inferno&quot; as the messenger sent to Beatrice from &quot;The blessed Dame&quot; (the Virgin Mary), to rouse Beatrice to send Virgil to Dante&#x27;s aid. Henry Fanshawe Tozer identifies Lucia as representing &quot;illuminative grace&quot;. According to Robert Pogue Harrison and Rachel Jacoff, Lucia&#x27;s appearance in this intermediary role is to reinforce the scene in which Virgil tries to fortify Dante&#x27;s courage to begin the journey through the inferno.

In &quot;Purgatorio&quot; 9.52–63, Lucy carries a sleeping Dante to the entrance to purgatory. Since Lucy represents light, her appearance in &quot;Purgatorio&quot; 9 mirrors her appearance in &quot;Inferno&quot; 2; both times she carries him out of darkness. Lucy&#x27;s light symbolism also explains why Dante tells this evening scene in &quot;Purgatorio&quot; 9 through the lens of the dawn. She carries him both out of the literal darkness to a new day, as well as the figurative darkness to lead him to salvation.

Then in &quot;Paradiso&quot; 32, Dante places her opposite Adam within the Mystic Rose in Canto XXXII of the &quot;Paradiso&quot;. Lucy may also be seen as a figure of Illuminating Grace or Mercy or even Justice.

===Donne===
In the Late Middle Ages the shortest day of the year usually fell on her feast day, and the two became associated, as in John Donne&#x27;s poem, &quot;A Nocturnal upon St. Lucie&#x27;s Day, being the shortest day&quot; (1627). The poem begins with: &quot;&#x27;Tis the year&#x27;s midnight, and it is the day&#x27;s&quot;. Due to the inaccuracy of the Julian Calendar, the shortest day actually fell a day or two earlier in Donne&#x27;s time.

Lucia is also the protagonist of a Swedish novel: &quot;Ett ljus i mörkret&quot; (&quot;A light in the darkness&quot;) by Agneta Sjödin.

==Popular celebration==
Lucy&#x27;s feast is on 13 December, in Advent. Her feast once coincided with the Winter Solstice, the shortest day of the year, before calendar reforms, so her feast day has become a festival of light.

St. Lucy is the patron saint of the city of Syracuse (Sicily). On 13 December a silver statue of St. Lucy containing her relics is paraded through the streets before returning to the Cathedral of Syracuse. Sicilians recall a legend that holds that a famine ended on her feast day when ships loaded with grain entered the harbor. Here, it is traditional to eat whole grains instead of bread on 13 December. This usually takes the form of cuccìa, a dish of boiled wheat berries often mixed with ricotta and honey, or sometimes served as a savory soup with beans.

Celebration of St. Lucy&#x27;s day is particularly seen in Scandinavian countries, with their long dark winters. Traditionally, a young girl is dressed in a white dress and a red sash (as the symbol of martyrdom) and wears a crown or wreath of candles on her head. In Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and parts of Finland, girls and boys dressed as Lucy or different roles associated with Christmastide, such as carry Saint Stephen or 
gingerbread men, walking in procession as songs are sung. Lucia celebrations are held in various places such as schools, churches, offices and hospitals, traditionally combined with eating saffron buns and gingerbread cookies. It is said that to vividly celebrate St. Lucy&#x27;s Day will help one live the long winter days with enough light.

A special devotion to St. Lucy is practiced in the Italian regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, in the North of the country, and Sicily and Calabria, in the South, as well as in the Croatian coastal region of Dalmatia. The feast is a Catholic-celebrated holiday with roots that can be traced to Sicily. On the 13th of every December it is celebrated with large traditional feasts of home-made pasta and various other Italian dishes, with a special dessert called cuccìa, made of wheatberries, butter, sugar, chocolate, and milk. The large grains of soft wheat are representative of her eyes and are a treat only to be indulged in once a year. In North Italy, Saint Lucy brings gift to children between 12 and 13 December. Traditionally a bouquet of hay is put outside of the house for Lucy&#x27;s Donkey and food in the house for Lucy to refresh them after the long night bringing gifts to every kid. In small towns, a parade with Saint Lucy is held the evening of the 12th when she goes through the main streets of the town munching sweets and candy from her cart, always together with her donkey. 
A Hungarian custom is to plant wheat in a small pot on St. Lucy&#x27;s feast. By Christmas green sprouts appear, signs of life coming from death. The wheat is then carried to the manger scene as the symbol of Christ in the Eucharist. 

The day is celebrated in the Philippines as well. Villagers from Barangay Sta. Lucia in Magarao, Camarines Sur, hold a novena to St. Lucy nine days before her feast. A procession of the saint&#x27;s image is held every morning at the poblacion or village centre during the nine days leading up to St. Lucy&#x27;s Day, attracting devotees from other parts of the Bicol Region. Hymns to the saint, known as the &quot;Gozos&quot;, as well as the Spanish version of the Ave Maria are chanted during the dawn procession, which is followed by a Mass. In Barangay Sta. Lucia, Asturias town in midwestern Cebu, thousands of devotees used to visit her parish to celebrate and venerate her sainthood. Along with their veneration to her are the hope in faith that her Holy water is instrumental in channeling Almighty God&#x27;s grace and blessings in the form of protection, purification and healing from illness particularly eye disorders to them as she is best known for being the Patron Saint of the blind.

The feast day is also commemorated in Barangay Sucad in Apalit Pampanga after the traditional nine-day novena, where a whole day celebration is observed through Eucharistic Masses, festivals and the procession of the religious sculpture of Sta. Lucia in the evening before the evening Mass.

<text>Roe, ( ) or hard roe, is the fully ripe internal egg masses in the ovaries, or the released external egg masses, of fish and certain marine animals such as shrimp, scallop, sea urchins and squid. As a seafood, roe is used both as a cooked ingredient in many dishes, and as a raw ingredient for delicacies such as caviar.

The roe of marine animals, such as the roe of lumpsucker, hake, mullet, salmon, Atlantic bonito, mackerel, squid, and cuttlefish are especially rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids, but omega-3s are present in all fish roe. Also, a significant amount of vitamin B12 is among the nutrients present in fish roes.

====Israel====

Several sections of the Israeli cuisine include roe. In Modern Hebrew, roe is commonly referred to by its Russian name &quot;ikra&quot; (איקרה). When necessary, the color is also mentioned: white or pink, as appropriate. Israeli &quot;white ikra&quot; is commonly made of carp or herring eggs, while &quot;red ikra&quot; is made of flathead mullet eggs or, in rarer cases, salmon eggs. The term &quot;caviar&quot; is separate, and denotes only sturgeon eggs.

In Judaism, roe from kosher fish—fish with fins and scales—is considered kosher. Like fish in general, it is considered pareve. However, roe is considered kosher only if the fish from which it is harvested is kosher as well. Caviar from sturgeon is therefore not considered kosher from an Orthodox Jewish perspective, as that fish is not understood to have scales under Orthodox interpretations of Jewish law.

For most observant Orthodox Jewish consumers who keep kosher, roe or caviar must be processed under kosher supervision as well. The only exception to this rule is red roe, thanks to a widely accepted responsa by the Bais Yosef.

Also, Russians tend to translate any &quot;ikra&quot; as &quot;caviar&quot;, thus creating the impression of availability of sturgeon roe.

Sturgeon roe, called &quot;chyornaya ikra&quot; (чёрная икра, &quot;black caviar&quot;) is most prized. It is followed in prestige by salmon roe called &quot;krasnaya ikra&quot; (красная икра, &quot;red caviar&quot;), which is less expensive, but still considered a delicacy. Both types of roe are usually served lightly salted on buttered wheat bread, or as an accompaniment for blini, or used as an ingredient in various &quot;haute cuisine&quot; and festive dishes. The butter on bread may soften the taste of large pellets of black or red roe this way, by making it more dull, and the bread should be soft and fresh rather than soggy, crisp or bun-like dense.

More common roes, such as cod, Alaska pollock, and herring ones are everyday dishes, combining richness in protein with low price. Salted cod or pollock roe on buttered bread is common breakfast fare and herring roe is often eaten smoked or fried. The roe of freshwater fish is also popular but the commercial availability is lower. Soft roe of various fishes is also widely consumed, mostly fried, and is a popular cantina-style dish. 
* For those &quot;everyday&quot; roes, the buttered bread makes sense, since the canned roe is more salty than &quot;caviar&quot; sturgeon roe.
* Capelin roe mixed with cream is sold in convenience stores of Russia as a more gentle-tasting variant of aforementioned canned roe spreads.

Roe found in dried vobla fish is considered delicious by some; though dried vobla roe is not produced separately as a stand-alone dish, roe-carrying vobla is prized.

====Spain====
Cod and hake roe is commonly consumed throughout Spain in many different forms: sautéed, grilled, fried, marinated, pickled, boiled, with mayonnaise, or in salad. Tuna and ling dry brined roe is traditional in Andalusia and the Mediterranean coasts since antiquity. In all of the Spanish coastal regions, sea urchin roe is considered a delicacy and consumed raw. Roe from the Mediterranean grey mullet, &quot;Mugil cephalus&quot;, is a sustainable roe resembling sturgeon roe that is marketed from Spain to countries around the world.

====Sweden====

Smoked and salted cod roe paste known as smörgåskaviar is commonly served as sandwich topping in Sweden.

Lightly salted roe of the vendace is called Löjrom in Swedish. It is naturally orange in colour. The most sought after type is Kalix Löjrom from Kalix in the northern Baltic sea.

Most Löjrom consumed in Sweden is however imported frozen from North America.

Stenbitsrom, the roe of lumpfish is naturally a bleak unappetizing gray, but is coloured black (to emulate black caviar) or orange (to emulate Löjrom). Stenbitsrom sells in much larger volume than Löjrom, but it has two drawbacks: it tastes of little more than its salt and artificial additives, and the colour additives tend to bleed into other parts of the food served with it (such as a boiled egg), or to discolour porcelain dishes.

There is also a trend to use more Laxrom (salmon roe), which is a natural orange colour, with a large diameter.

====United Kingdom====
Though not popular, herring roe is sold within many British supermarkets. Battered cod roe can also be bought from many fish and chip shops. Various tinned roes are on sale in supermarkets e.g. soft cod roes, pressed cod roes and herring roes.

<text>A regressive tax is a tax imposed in such a manner that the tax rate decreases as the amount subject to taxation increases. &quot;Regressive&quot; describes a distribution effect on income or expenditure, referring to the way the rate progresses from high to low, so that the average tax rate exceeds the marginal tax rate.

The regressivity of a particular tax can also factor the propensity of the taxpayers to engage in the taxed activity relative to their resources (the demographics of the tax base). In other words, if the activity being taxed is more likely to be carried out by the poor and less likely to be carried out by the rich, the tax may be considered regressive. To measure the effect, the income elasticity of the good being taxed as well as the income effect on consumption must be considered. The measure can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime.

==Examples==

=== Poll taxes ===

A poll tax is a fixed sum levied on all individuals regardless of their economic circumstance. By the late 20th century most major economies severed the practice (e.g. twenty-fourth amendment or council tax). 

Perhaps the most notable example of public&#x27;s dissatisfaction with poll taxes is the Community Charge implemented by Margaret Thatcher. The handling of the tax system transmission and the aftermath of inept government intervention became subject to mass criticism. Negative impacts of the poll tax disproportionally fell on lower income groups; Whilst an effective government would have provided extensive welfare programs and adjust national tax systems to aid those groups, the British government failed to provide any protection and only succeeded in antagonizing the beneficiaries of the reform.

The failure to gain public support only stagnated the already troublesome administrative burden. The result were riots and wide-spread noncompliance which rendered the tax uncollectable. Coupled with mismanagement of government injections and low tax revenue, the situation snowballed and endangered local autonomy which thus further fueled civic unrest.This stresses the importance of establishing tax systems which enjoy the wide support of the public and are simple to administer; The Community Charge was later scrapped and replaced under John Major&#x27;s cabinet.

=== Lump-sum tax ===
Lump-sum tax is a fixed tax imposed on individuals or businesses. It doesn’t vary based on income or wealth. This means that all taxpayers are required to pay the same fixed amount, regardless of their financial status.

Lump-sum tax practice has fallen out from the mainstream with only one country, Switzerland, still adhering to it. However, this trend is still challenged by some economists who believe in its efficiency due to factors like the simplicity of administration or lower tax evasion rates. 

Recent studies suggest utilizing modified lump-sum tax as a form of a wealth tax. This is derived from the belief that wealth can based upon estimated consumption of the individual, thus the tax indirectly targets the presumably higher level of expenditure of wealthy individuals. It shifts the tax burden to people with a higher marginal propensity to consume. In this case, it assumed to be non-mandatory and one-time. 

=== A tax with a cap ===
A tax with a cap, above which no taxes are paid, such as the American Social Security Tax, which does not apply to wages over an annual limit.

=== Sin taxes ===
Sin taxes (pigouvian taxes) levies imposed on goods and activities deemed harmful to individuals or society (most common examples are tobacco, alcohol or gambling). Regressivity in sin taxes stems from their disproportionate impact on lower-income households, who tend to allocate a larger share of their income to sin goods compared to wealthier individuals. Such taxes are often imposed at a uniform rate so they will make up a greater proportion of the final price of cheaper brands, compared to the higher-quality products generally consumed by the wealthy. For example, &quot;people in the bottom income quintile spend a 78% larger share of their income on alcohol taxes than people in the top quintile.&quot; Tobacco in particular is highly regressive, with the bottom quintile of income paying an effective rate 583% higher than that of the top quintile. Other example is the fact that just 10% of households account for 80% of sin tax revenue in the USA.

=== Allowance reduction ===
An allowance reduction in an income tax system allows for an individual&#x27;s personal allowance to be withdrawn, making a higher marginal tax for a limited band before returning to the underlying rate. In the UK, there is an effective 60% band at £100,000, which returns to 40% at £120,000.

=== Excise taxation ===
Non-uniform excise taxation based on everyday essentials like food (fat tax, salt tax), transport (fuel tax, fare hikes for public transport, mobility pricing), energy (carbon tax) and housing (council tax, window tax) is frequently regressive on income. The income elasticity of demand of food, for example, is usually less than 1 (inelastic) (&quot;see Engel&#x27;s law&quot;) and therefore as a household&#x27;s income rises, the tax collected on the food remains almost the same. Therefore, as a proportion of available expenditure, the relative tax burden falls more heavily on households with lower incomes. Some governments offer rebates to households with lower incomes, ostensibly in an effort to mitigate the regressive nature of these taxes.

A related concept exists where production and importation of essential goods are strictly controlled, such as milk, eggs, cheese and poultry under Canada&#x27;s supply management system, the result being that the products will sell for a higher price than they would under a free market system. The difference in price is often criticized for being a &quot;regressive tax&quot; even though such products are generally not taxed directly.

=== Payroll taxes ===
Payroll taxes, such as FICA and Unemployment Insurance in the United States, and consumption taxes such as value-added tax and sales taxes are regressive in that they both raise prices of purchased goods. Lower-income earners save and invest less money, so pay a larger proportion of their income toward these taxes, directly for sales tax and as the price increase required to make revenue covering payrolls for payroll taxes.

=== Tariffs ===
Tariffs are a tax imposed on imported goods form another country. Their main purpose, besides increasing revenue, is to protect domestic industries, since governments can use tariffs to benefit particular industries, often doing so to protect companies and jobs. For example, a tariff might be imposed on an imported good that competes with a domestically-produced good, making the imported good more expensive and thus less attractive to consumers. Some examples include tariffs imposed on steel imported into United States from all countries except for Canada and Mexico in April 2018 by Donald Trump. Tariffs are often considered regressive as they disproportionately burden those with lower incomes, who typically spend a higher percentage of their earnings on goods affected by tariffs. The difference of change in after-tax income between lowest and top quintile is 0.2%.

=== Other forms of regressive taxes ===
* Property tax in regard to automobiles, better known as the &quot;car tax&quot; in some jurisdictions.
* Lotteries have been described as a disguised regressive tax.

== Comparing progressive and regressive taxation ==
A progressive tax is a type of tax where the tax rate increases as the taxable amount or income increases. This means that individuals or entities with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. On the contrary, a regressive tax is a tax system where the tax rate decreases as the taxable amount increases. This implies that as the value of the asset purchased or owned by the taxpayer increases, the tax rate applied decreases.

In a progressive tax system, the tax is levied on income or profit based on a rate schedule that increases as income or profit increases. This is in stark contrast to a regressive tax system, where the tax is charged as a percentage of the asset purchased or owned by the taxpayer, regardless of their income or ability to pay.

One of the key features of a progressive tax system is that it takes into account the taxpayer’s ability to pay. This means that higher-income individuals or entities are taxed at a higher rate because they have a greater ability to pay the tax. In contrast, in a regressive tax system, the level of income of the taxpayer is not considered. This means that the tax is applied equally to all taxpayers, regardless of their income level.

Progressive tax systems typically include all forms of direct taxes, which are taxes that are paid directly to the government by the individual or entity on whom it is imposed. On the other hand, regressive tax systems usually encompass all forms of indirect taxes, which are taxes that are collected by an intermediary (such as a retail store) from the person who bears the ultimate economic burden of the tax (such as the consumer).

In a progressive tax system, the marginal tax rate (the tax rate on the last dollar of income earned) is greater than the average tax rate (the total tax paid divided by total income earned). Conversely, in a regressive tax system, the marginal tax rate is lower than the average tax rate.

== Measurement ==
One common way to measure tax progressivity is by looking at the percentage change in after-tax income. This method assumes that a household’s economic wellbeing, or welfare, is closely linked to its after-tax income. Therefore, a tax cut that increases everyone’s after-tax income by the same percentage leaves the relative distribution of after-tax income unchanged. If a tax cut increases after-tax income proportionately more for lower-income taxpayers than for higher-income taxpayers, it will make the tax system more progressive (or less regressive). Conversely, a tax cut that increases after-tax income proportionately more for higher-income taxpayers than for lower-income taxpayers will make the tax system less progressive (or more regressive).

However, this method has its limitations. For instance, it does not take into account the fact that the burden of paying a certain amount of tax is much greater on a household with a lower income than it is on a household with a higher income. Therefore, some analysts believe that other measures, such as the share of the tax cut received, and the size of the tax cut in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of initial tax liability, are more accurate representations of the distribution of tax burdens.

Another approach to measuring tax progressivity is by looking at the redistributive effect of taxes and transfers. This method involves measuring the difference in the Gini coefficient of incomes before and after taxes and transfers. The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality, with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality. Therefore, a decrease in the Gini coefficient after taxes and transfers would indicate that the tax system is progressive.

In low-income countries, a detailed analysis of progressivity requires a welfare ranking of individuals or households, and for tax liabilities of each individual or household to be ascertained. This method takes into account the broader concept of redistribution, which includes not only taxes but also transfers and other forms of government intervention.

== Political ideologies and taxation policy ==
Neoliberalism, characterized by its emphasis on free markets, limited government intervention, and individual responsibility, has had a profound impact on tax systems worldwide. Neoliberal tax policies typically prioritize reducing taxes for the wealthy and corporations under the belief that such measures stimulate economic growth and investment. This approach often results in regressive tax structures, where the burden falls disproportionately on lower-income individuals and households.

In contrast to neoliberalism, social democratic ideologies advocate for progressive taxation as a means of redistributing wealth and funding social welfare programs. Progressive taxation entails higher tax rates for those with higher incomes, with the aim of mitigating inequality and providing resources for public goods and services. Social democratic countries often prioritize universal access to healthcare, education, and social security, funded through progressive taxation and robust public investment. 

== Implementations ==
Examining real-world examples of regressive taxation offers valuable insights into its impact on different societies and the efficacy of various policy responses.
In 2005, the Swiss canton of Obwalden implemented a regressive taxation system. It was struck down by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland in 2007, because it ran counter to the Swiss Federal Constitution.

Regressive taxes are implemented in the United States primarily through sales taxes, excise taxes, and payroll taxes. Sales taxes are imposed by state and local governments on goods and services, impacting lower-income individuals more as they spend a larger portion of their income on necessities subject to these taxes. Excise taxes, such as those on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol, also tend to affect lower-income households disproportionately because they consume a higher percentage of their income on these taxed items. Additionally, the Social Security payroll tax is regressive up to a certain income threshold, as it applies to all workers but only taxes a portion of their earnings, exempting higher-income earners beyond that threshold. These regressive tax mechanisms exacerbates inequality since lower-income individuals are paying a larger share of their income in taxes compared to higher-income individuals. Tax cuts for the wealthy under the Trump administration further tilted the scales in favor of the rich, contributing to income inequality concerns in the U.S.

Brazil uses a regressive tax system. Those who earn up to twice the minimum wage spend 48.8% of their income on taxes, while the families with income higher than 30 times the minimum wage pay only 26.3% of their income on taxes. Brazil has a huge gap between the poor and the rich. Regressive taxation only widens this gap. This is the reason why the inequality in Brazil is as high as it is.

== Arguments for regressive taxation ==

* Funding public goods: Regressive taxes can be an effective way to fund public goods and services. A sales tax can help fund public infrastructure, education, and healthcare.
* Healthier society: Sin taxes promote healthy behavior. The taxes can be used to discourage unhealthy behaviors. They can help reduce consumption of harmful products (cigarettes, alcohol or soda to name a few). Studies show that increased price is very effective way of incentivising smokers to quit smoking.
* Economic growth: Some economists argue that lowering taxes on high-income earners encourages entrepreneurship, investment, and job creation, thereby benefiting the overall economy, this can potentially stimulate economic activity.
* Simplicity: Regressive tax system is easier to administer and enforce than a progressive one. This is because a regressive tax system has a flat tax rate for all income levels, requiring fewer resources to implement and enforce.
* Efficiency: Regressive taxes are non-distortionary. They do not discourage people from working or investing, unlike progressive income taxes.
* Balancing other taxes: Regressive taxes can help balance the tax system, since some parts of it are highly progressive (for example income tax). Thus introducing regressive taxes can help reduce the overall progressivity of the tax system.

== Arguments against regressive taxation ==

* Economic inequality: This is arguably the main argument against regressive taxes. At the individual level, regressive taxes disproportionately burden low-income households, consuming a larger share of their disposable income. This can perpetuate cycles of poverty and hinder upward mobility, as struggling families are forced to allocate more resources towards basic necessities rather than savings or investments. 
* Increased financial stress: Regressive taxes can lead to increased financial stress for low-income individuals and families. If a large portion of an individual’s income goes towards paying taxes, they may struggle to afford basic necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare.
* Decreased productivity of workers: Heavily taxed individuals may be discouraged to work hard or they may choose to work less (or to not work at all).
* Less consumer spending: People would spend less money because of higher tax burden. Lower purchasing power of consumers may lead to a failure of some businesses.

<doc id="294509" wikidata="Q520178" url="?curid=294509" title="Wyoming-class battleship">
<text>The &quot;Wyoming&quot; class was a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the United States Navy. and were authorized in early 1909, and were built between 1910 and 1912. These were the fourth dreadnought design of the US Navy, but only an incremental improvement over the preceding , and the last US battleships to use 12-inch guns. The primary changes were the adoption of a more powerful /50 caliber Mark 7 gun, addition of a sixth twin-gun turret and improved armor protection, including the first use of a torpedo bulkhead on American battleships. The Navy considered using more powerful guns, but this would have caused delays and required larger docks.

The two ships frequently served together, first in the Atlantic Fleet in the 1910s. Both vessels were deployed to British waters after the United States entered World War I in April 1917 to reinforce the Royal Navy&#x27;s Grand Fleet. They served in the Pacific Fleet in 1919–21, before both returned to the Atlantic Fleet. Much of their time in the Atlantic Fleet was spent conducting peacetime training exercises, along with taking midshipmen from the US Naval Academy on training cruises. &quot;Wyoming&quot; and &quot;Arkansas&quot; were heavily modernized in the mid-1920s, receiving more efficient oil-fired boilers to replace their old coal-fired models, thicker deck armor to protect against plunging fire, anti-torpedo bulges to increase their resistance to underwater damage, and anti-aircraft guns to defend against aerial attacks.

The London Naval Treaty of 1930 mandated that &quot;Wyoming&quot; be demilitarized; she accordingly was converted into a training ship, with half of her main battery turrets, belt armor, and anti-torpedo bulges removed. However, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was permitted to continue in service with the fleet. After the United States entered World War II, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was used to escort convoys to North Africa. By 1944, she served as a coastal bombardment vessel; in this role, she supported Allied landings at Normandy (Operation Overlord) and southern France (Operation Dragoon) before being transferred to the Pacific, where she provided fire support to Marines fighting on Iwo Jima and at Okinawa in 1945. &quot;Wyoming&quot; meanwhile continued as a training ship, being modified further in 1944 to include the various types of anti-aircraft guns that trainees would operate in the fleet. Both ships were decommissioned shortly after the war, with &quot;Arkansas&quot; being expended as a target ship during the 1946 nuclear tests at Operation Crossroads, and &quot;Wyoming&quot; being sold for scrap in 1947.

== Design ==
On 22 July 1908, the Newport Conference was held; this included the General Board, the staff of the Naval War College, President Theodore Roosevelt—who had a keen interest in naval matters—and other officers. This conference examined a series of issues relating to existing battleships and new designs; the first of these new ships would become the &quot;Wyoming&quot; class. The Board on Construction received general instructions from the Newport Conference; those at the conference favored adopting the 14-inch gun, as the British Royal Navy had already traded their 12-inch guns for pieces. The Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd) estimated that design work on the new gun, production, and testing would take two years. On 26 August, the Secretary of the Navy, Victor Metcalf, issued a request for eight- and ten-gun battleships armed with the 14-inch weapons to the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&amp;R). Speed was to be at least , with as much armor as could be accommodated.

BuOrd argued that at likely battle ranges, , the 12-inch gun was powerful enough to penetrate existing armor, and so the 14-inch gun was unnecessary. C&amp;R produced three designs to meet Metcalf&#x27;s request, all based on the preceding design; the first, referred to as design 404, was a battleship armed with eight 14-inch guns. The second, design 502, had an additional twin turret for a total of ten 14-inch guns. The third, design 601, would be fitted with twelve 12-inch guns. The General Board chose 601, since the design work for the 14-inch gun had not begun, and adopting it would have caused the class to be delayed. In addition, the ships&#x27; displacement would have increased more dramatically with the larger gun, requiring extensive improvements to harbor facilities; design 502 would have only been able to dock in Pearl Harbor and Puget Sound with the existing facilities. The placement of the secondary battery also proved to be problematic. The cruise of the Great White Fleet in 1907–09 had demonstrated the problems with casemates on the main deck. They were too easily washed out in even moderate seas, making them unusable. Some officers at the Newport Conference had advocated placing them in the superstructure, but the heavy guns used by the Navy would have added excessive top weight. Another alternative was to place them in the forecastle, but the additional weight forward would have strained the ship where the forecastle stepped down to the main deck. The designers ultimately settled on a full-length forecastle, which allowed the casemates to be moved about higher in the hull.

The ships&#x27; armor protection was improved over earlier designs. The belt and barbette armor was increased by an inch compared to an earlier version of the twelve-gun battleship. A new protection scheme for the funnels was devised, after the Russian experience at the Battle of Tsushima three years before had highlighted the risk of a destroyed exhaust system. The designers also emphasized the need for improved underwater protection. As a result, the &quot;Wyoming&quot;s design incorporated a torpedo bulkhead, the first time the feature was included on an American battleship design. Congress approved two new battleships, BB-32 and BB-33, on 3 March 1909. Design 502 later proved to be the basis for the subsequent class of battleships, the s.

===General characteristics and machinery===
The ships of the &quot;Wyoming&quot; class were long at the waterline and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . The ships displaced as designed and up to at full load. They had a full length flush deck, which improved sea-keeping and the ability to work the secondary guns in heavier seas. Both ships were fitted with lattice masts. Their transverse metacentric height was . Freeboard was forward, amidships, at the aftmost turret, and at the stern. They had a crew of 58 officers and 1,005 enlisted men.

The ships were powered by four-shaft Parsons steam turbines rated at . Steam was provided by twelve mixed oil and coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, which were trunked into two closely spaced funnels amidships. The engines generated a top speed of , though on speed trials &quot;Arkansas&quot; made from . Fuel capacity was of coal and of oil. This allowed the ships to cruise for at a speed of . At , the range fell considerably, to . Steering was controlled by a single rudder.

=== Armament ===

The ships were armed with a main battery of twelve 12-inch/50 caliber Mark 7 Mod 0 guns in six Mark IX twin-gun turrets all on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward. The other four turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in two superfiring pairs. These guns fired a shell with a propellant charge, which produced a muzzle velocity of . &quot;Wyoming&quot; and &quot;Arkansas&quot; were the only ships of the US Navy to receive the gun; earlier dreadnoughts were equipped with the lower-velocity 12-inch/45-caliber Mark 5 gun. The Mark 7 had significantly better armor penetrating capabilities, owing to its higher muzzle velocity (and thus higher striking velocity). At a range of , the gun could penetrate of contemporary face-hardened armor, compared to for the Mark 5. The guns were mounted in the Mark IX gun turret, which allowed for elevation to 15 degrees and depression to −5 degrees. Unlike the turrets used on earlier dreadnoughts, the Mark IX turret required the guns to return to 0 degrees to reload.

The secondary battery consisted of twenty-one 5-inch/51 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull. These guns fired a shell with a charge of , at a muzzle velocity of . As was standard for capital ships of the period, they carried a pair of submerged torpedo tubes in the hull on the broadside. They were equipped with the Mark III Bliss-Leavitt design, which carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .

===Armor===
The main armored belt, which was high, was thick over the central portion of the ship, where it protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces. The belt reduced to toward the stern. On the bottom edge it was reduced to . The forward end of the belt was connected with an 11 in thick transverse bulkhead with the forward-most main battery barbette, while the aft end of the belt was connected with a 9 in bulkhead. The main armored deck was of special treatment steel, reduced to in less critical areas. The conning tower had thick sides and a thick roof.

The gun turrets had thick faces and 3 in thick roofs. Their supporting barbettes had 11 in thick sides where they were exposed; the portions that were masked by the armored belt were reduced to . The lower half of the casemate armor was 11 in thick, and the upper half was reduced to . Inboard of the casemate battery were longitudinal armored bulkheads; these were designed to protect the uptakes to the funnels. These were deemed important because during the Russo-Japanese War, three years before, Russian battleships had had their uptakes damaged, which ducted the boiler smoke into the ship rather than out through the funnels.

=== Modifications ===
Both ships were significantly modified throughout their careers. During and shortly after World War I, the horizontal armor of the ships was improved, including the roofs of the conning tower and the gun turrets. Their deck armor was increased to , and eight /50 caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed. Following the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in February 1922, modernization work was strictly controlled. The treaty governed what modifications could be made to existing ships, and included restrictions on what could be changed or added. Displacement could rise by no more than and no alterations of any kind could be made to the main battery guns or mounts. The primary areas that could be improved were those that concerned defense against aerial and underwater attack, along with propulsion systems.
The two &quot;Wyoming&quot;s, along with the &quot;Florida&quot;s and &quot;New York&quot;s, were heavily modernized in the 1920s. All six ships were converted to completely oil-fired boilers with equipment taken from the cancelled &quot;South Dakota&quot;-class battleships. The boilers were trunked into a single funnel. These boilers were much more efficient than the coal-fired models the ships had been completed with, and they allowed a significantly greater cruising radius of . The ships were also fitted with anti-torpedo bulges, which improved their underwater defense and also provided additional oil storage capacity. &quot;Wyoming&quot; and &quot;Arkansas&quot; lost their cage main mast, which was replaced by a short tripod mast that carried searchlights and radio antennas. Some of their secondary battery guns were relocated higher in the ship to improve their workability in heavy seas. A sponson for six guns was built into the hull abreast of the conning tower and the eight 3-inch anti-aircraft guns were moved to the top of the sponson. Both ships had their torpedo tubes removed.

Under the terms of the 1930 London Naval Treaty, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was to be demilitarized and converted into a training ship. During the demilitarization process, her anti-torpedo bulges, side armor, and half of her main battery guns were removed. &quot;Wyoming&quot; was modernized at Norfolk Navy Yard from 12 January to 3 April 1944; the reconstruction removed the last of her three 12-inch gun turrets, and replaced them with four twin and two single enclosed mounts for 5-inch/38 caliber guns. New fire control radars were also installed; these modifications allowed &quot;Wyoming&quot; to train anti-aircraft gunners with the most modern equipment they would use while in combat with the fleet. Modifications to &quot;Arkansas&quot; during World War II were kept to a minimum. In 1942, &quot;Arkansas&quot; received a new tripod foremast and bridgework, along with more anti-aircraft guns throughout the war. By 1945, she carried nine quadruple 40 mm Bofors mounts and twenty-eight 20 mm Oerlikons, and the number of 3-inch guns had been increased to ten.

==Ships in class==
== Service history ==
After entering service, both ships were assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. The ships took part in the normal routine of training and fleet maneuvers off the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean, interspersed with periodic maintenance. Both ships toured the Mediterranean in late 1913, making stops in Italy and France, among others. In April 1914, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was involved in the occupation of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution, and &quot;Wyoming&quot; arrived later to support the operation. Two men from &quot;Arkansas&quot; earned the Medal of Honor for their actions during the initial occupation of the city. After the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, &quot;Wyoming&quot;, along with the rest of Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9), steamed to Britain to reinforce the Royal Navy&#x27;s Grand Fleet, stationed in Scapa Flow. &quot;Arkansas&quot; initially remained in the United States, training gun crews for the expanding wartime fleet. In July 1918, she too was sent to Britain. Neither ship saw action during the war, though they were present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered in November 1918.

From mid-1919 to mid-1921, &quot;Arkansas&quot; and &quot;Wyoming&quot; served in the Pacific Fleet, with the latter serving as the flagship of BatDiv 6. During this time, the ships made a tour of Central and South American countries, culminating in a visit to Valparaiso, where they took part in a naval review for the Chilean president. Both battleships returned in service with the Atlantic Fleet in mid-1921. They returned to their peacetime routine of training and maneuvers and periodic maintenance. In the summers, the ships would generally take midshipmen from the US Naval Academy on training cruises. In June 1925, &quot;Arkansas&quot; assisted relief efforts after the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake. From late 1925 to late 1926, &quot;Arkansas&quot; received her reconstruction, followed by &quot;Wyoming&quot; in 1927. In 1929 and 1930, &quot;Arkansas&quot; visited European waters on midshipmen cruises; she made stops in several countries. &quot;Wyoming&quot; was reduced to a training ship in 1931 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty, and she spent the next decade conducting training cruises for midshipmen and NROTC cadets.

From early 1932 to early 1934, &quot;Arkansas&quot; returned for another stint in the Pacific Fleet, followed by another tour of Europe later in the year. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she was assigned to the reserve force for the Neutrality Patrols. She supported the replacement of Canadian troops by American ones maintaining the occupation of Iceland in July 1941 as an escort for the troopship convoys. In November, as it became increasingly apparent that the United States would become involved in World War II, &quot;Wyoming&quot; was reassigned as a gunnery training ship, a role she served in for the duration of the war. &quot;Arkansas&quot;, meanwhile, continued in front-line service during the war, first as an escort to convoys to North Africa, and then as a shore bombardment vessel. She supported the landings at Normandy in June 1944, shelling German positions at Omaha Beach, before bombarding Cherbourg later in the month. Her next bombardment mission came with Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France, in August that year. She was then transferred to the Pacific Theater of Operations for action against the Japanese. She bombarded Japanese positions on Iwo Jima in February 1945 and on Okinawa in April.

With the end of the war in September 1945, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was employed with Operation Magic Carpet, repatriating American soldiers in the Pacific. &quot;Wyoming&quot; remained in service briefly after the war, though she was decommissioned in August 1947. She was sold for scrap in October and subsequently broken up. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was instead retained for use as a target ship during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in mid-1946. She survived the first test, an air-burst code-named ABLE, though the second experiment, an underwater detonation code-named BAKER, sank the ship.

<text>The United Farm Workers of America, or more commonly just United Farm Workers (UFW), is a labor union for farmworkers in the United States. It originated from the merger of two workers&#x27; rights organizations, the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) led by César Chávez, Dolores Huerta, and Gilbert Padilla and the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) led by organizer Larry Itliong. They allied and transformed from workers&#x27; rights organizations into a union as a result of a series of strikes in 1965, when the Filipino-American and Mexican-American farmworkers of the AWOC in Delano, California, initiated a grape strike, and the NFWA went on strike in support. As a result of the commonality in goals and methods, the NFWA and the AWOC formed the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee on August 22, 1966. This organization was accepted into the AFL–CIO in 1972 and changed its name to the United Farm Workers Union.

==History==

=== Founding of the UFW ===

In 1952, César Chávez met Fred Ross, who was a community organizer working on behalf of the Community Service Organization. During Chávez&#x27;s participation in the Community Service Organization, Fred Ross trained César Chávez in the grassroots, door-to-door, house meeting tactic of organization, a tactic crucial to the UFW&#x27;s recruiting methods. The house meeting tactic successfully established a broad base of local Community Service Organization chapters during Ross&#x27;s era, and Chávez used this technique to extend the UFW&#x27;s reach as well as to find up and coming organizers. During the 1950s, Chávez and Ross developed 22 new Community Service Organization chapters in the Mexican-American neighborhoods of San Jose.

In 1959, Chávez achieved the rank of executive director in the Community Service Organization. He established professional relationships with local community organizations that aimed to empower the working class population by encouraging them to become more politically active. One of these was the Agricultural Workers Association (AWA). Dolores Huerta created the AWA in 1960. Larry Itliong was a Filipino American labor organizer who forefronted the grape strike in Coachella Valley that led to the Delano Grape Strike of 1965. He became assistant director of the UFW. Chávez was the leader and also a gifted public speaker. Huerta was a skilled organizer and negotiator.

Chávez&#x27;s ultimate goal in participating with the Community Service Organization and the Industrial Areas Foundation was to organize a union for farm workers. In March 1962, at the Community Service Organization convention, Chávez proposed a pilot project for organizing farm workers, which the organization&#x27;s members rejected. Saul Alinsky did not share Chávez&#x27;s sympathy for the farm workers struggle, claiming that organizing farm workers, &quot;was like fighting on a constantly disintegrating bed of sand.&quot; (Alinsky, 1967) Chávez responded by resigning to create the farm workers union that later became known as the National Farm Workers Association.

By 1965, the National Farm Workers Association had acquired twelve hundred members through Chávez&#x27;s person-to-person recruitment efforts, which he had learned from Fred Ross a decade earlier. Out of those twelve hundred, only about two hundred paid dues. Also in 1962, Richard Chavez, the brother of César Chávez, designed the black Aztec eagle insignia that became the symbol of the NFW and the UFW. César Chávez chose the red and black colors used by the organization.

A variety of services were offered to union members during this early period, such as local medical clinics. During the grape strike of 1965 in Delano California, medical volunteers and UFW leadership began establishing medical clinics for workers due to a noticeable lack of affordable and accessible medical facilities in the area. The first clinics were established within local homes after the strike began. Wanting to expand the clinics, the UFW began sending letters to potential donors and supporters, which resulted in them receiving needed medical supplies and a trailer to act as an additional building for the clinic. These trailers served as the UFW&#x27;s main clinic in Delano until 1972 when they were closed down in favor of opening the Terronez Clinic.
Although still in its infant stages, the organization lent its support to a strike by workers in the rose industry in 1965. This initial protest by the young organization resulted in a failed attempt to strike against the rose industry. That same year the farm workers who worked in the Delano fields of California wanted to strike against the growers in response to the grower&#x27;s refusal to raise wages from $1.20 to $1.40 an hour, and they sought out Chávez and the National Farm Workers Association for support. The Delano agricultural workers were mostly Filipino workers affiliated with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, a charter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. The unification of these two organizations, in an attempt to boycott table grapes grown in the Delano fields, resulted in the creation of the United Farm Workers of America. The AFL–CIO chartered the United Farm Workers, officially combining the AWOC and the NFWA, in August 1966.

During the early years of the UFW, one of their most prominent allies was Senator Robert F. Kennedy. In March 1966, Kennedy visited and spoke with union members participating in the Delano grape strike and later conducted a hearing on migrant farm workers with senators George Murphy and Harrison Williams. One year later, Kennedy attended a UFW fundraiser where he felt threatened by a man in the crowd; in response, union members protected Kennedy so he could safely leave the event. Kennedy&#x27;s connection to and support of the UFW helped to give national momentum to the grape strike. When Kennedy began to campaign in the Democratic primary, the UFW suspended all strikes to campaign alongside him, leading to high turnout amongst them and their allies. The assassination of Kennedy greatly affected UFW members and their communities. Farm workers in Delano held a mass in his honor.

=== Historic complications in organizing farm workers prior to UFW formation ===
In the early history of American agriculture, farmworkers experienced many failed attempts to organize agricultural laborers. In 1903, Japanese and Mexican farm workers attempted to come together to fight for better wages and better working conditions. This attempt to organize agricultural laborers was ignored and disbanded when organizations, such as the American Federation of Labor, neglected to support their efforts, often withholding assistance on the basis of race.

In 1913, the Industrial Workers of the World organized a rally of two thousand farm workers at a large ranch in a rural area of Northern California. This resulted in an attack by National Guardsmen against participants. As a result of the violence, the two lead organizers for the Industrial Workers of the World were arrested, convicted of murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Some believe the two people arrested were wrongly convicted.

In the later 1910s and the 1920s in the United States, further attempts to organize farm laborers were undertaken by spontaneous local efforts, and some by communist unions. These attempts also failed because, at that time, the law did not require employers to negotiate with workers. Employers at the time could legally fire employees for union activity.

In 1936, the National Labor Relations Act took effect. This legislation provided most American workers the right to join unions and bargain collectively. Agricultural workers were exempt from the protection of this law. Some believe that this labor category was excluded as a result of a political tactic to gain the support of Southern politicians in the passing of this law.

In 1941, the United States Government and the Mexican Government enacted the Bracero Program. Initially, the two governments established this joint project to address Second World War labor shortages by allowing &quot;guest workers&quot; from Mexico to work in the American agricultural industry until the end of the crop harvest. Thousands of Mexican citizens came north to work in American fields, and growers used the opportunity to undercut domestic wages. They also used the Braceros to break strikes by resident farmworkers. This program was extended until 1964.

===Community organizing and divisions of labor in the UFW===
Before UFW was an official trade union associated with the AFL–CIO, the National Farm Workers Association was formed as a social movement organization more akin to a mutual-aid society inspired by the &quot;mutualistas&quot;, rather than a trade union. However, when they joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), led by Larry Itliong, in a grape-strike in 1965, the group soon took on the characteristics of a trade union and gained official union status with the AFL–CIO.

Many Mexican women in California who joined the UFW in the 1960s had been previously involved in community-based activism in the 1950s through the Community Service Organization for Latino civil rights. The racial discrimination and economic disadvantages they faced from a young age made it necessary to form networks of support like the CSO to empower Latinos in America with voter registration drives, citizenship classes, lawsuits and legislative campaigns, and political protests against police brutality and immigration policies.

While male activists held leadership roles and more authority, the women activists participated in volunteering and teaching valuable skills to individuals of the Latino community. By the 1960s, Dolores Huerta and others began to shift their attention to the labor exploitation of Latino farm workers in California and began to strike, demonstrate, and organize to fight for a myriad of issues that Mexican laborers faced. While many of the male leaders of the movement had the role of being dynamic, powerful speakers that inspired others to join the movement, the women devoted their efforts to negotiating better working contracts with companies, organizing boycotts, rallying for changes in immigration policies, registering Latinos to vote with Spanish language ballots, and increasing pressure on legislation to improve labor relations.

Among the women who engaged in activism for labor rights, traditional and non traditional patterns of activism existed. Mexican-American women like Dolores Huerta used their education and resources arrange programs at the grassroots level, sustaining and leading members it into the labor movement. As the sister-in-law of César Chávez, Huerta had great influence over the direction that it took. 

Between 1964 and 1965, Gilbert Padilla and Huerta organized wine and liquor boycotts throughout California. Later, in 1968, Huerta led the boycotts of grapes within the east coast, successfully convincing other unions, such as the seafarer union, to join their cause while also getting multiple pro-union neighborhoods in New York to join the boycotting of stores that sold from grapes striking farms. By 1973, Huerta began to act as a lobbyist for the UFW in the California State congress. During this period, she testified in favor of both Latino and Latina voting rights as well as further protections for farm workers. However, it was most common for Chicana activists and female labor union members to be involved in administrative tasks for the early stages of UFW. Women like Helen Chávez were important in responsibilities such as credit union bookkeeping and behind the scenes advising. Still, both women along with other Chicana activists participated in picketing with their families in the face of police intimidation and racial abuse. Keeping track of union services and membership were traditionally responsibilities given to female organizers and it was integral to the institutional survival of the UFW, but it has gone much less recognized throughout history due to the male led strikes receiving majority public attention.

=== Texas strike ===

In May 1966, California farm worker activist Eugene Nelson traveled to Texas and organized local farmworkers into the Independent Workers&#x27; Association. At the time, some melon workers lacked access to freshwater while working in the fields, some lacked sanitary facilities for human waste, and some were present in the fields as crop dusters dropped pesticides on the crops. On June 1, Nelson led workers to strike to protest poor working conditions and demanded $1.25 as a minimum hourly wage. Workers picketed and were arrested by Texas Rangers and local police. Day laborers arrived from Mexico to harvest the crop, and by the end of June the strike had failed.

On July 4, members of UFWOC, strikers, and members of the clergy set out on a march to Austin to demand the $1.25 minimum wage and other improvements for farm workers. Press coverage intensified as the marchers made their way north in the summer heat. Politicians, members of the AFL–CIO, and the Texas Council of Churches accompanied the protestors. Gov. John Connally, who had refused to meet them in Austin, traveled to New Braunfels with then House Speaker Ben Barnes and Attorney General Waggoner Carr to intercept the march and inform strikers that their efforts would have no effect.

Protestors arrived in Austin in time for a Labor Day rally, but no changes in law resulted. Strikes and arrests continued in Rio Grande City through 1966 into 1967. Violence increased as the spring melon crop ripened and time neared for the May harvest. In June, when beatings of two UFWOC supporters by Texas rangers surfaced, tempers flared.

At the end of June as the harvest was ending, members of the Senate Subcommittee on Migratory Labor, including Senators Harrison Williams and Edward Kennedy, arrived in the lower Rio Grande Valley to hold hearings in Rio Grande City and Edinburg, Texas. The senators took their findings back to Washington as a report on pending legislation. Subsequently, the rangers left the area and the picketing ended. On September 20, Hurricane Beulah&#x27;s devastations ruined the farming industry in the Valley for the following year. One major outcome of the strikes came in the form of a 1974 Supreme Court victory in &quot;Medrano v. Allee,&quot; limiting jurisdiction of Texas Rangers in labor disputes. Farm workers continued to organize through the 1970s on a smaller scale, under new leadership in San Juan, Texas, independent of César Chávez.

=== Texas campaign ===
By mid-1971 the Texas campaign was well underway. In Sept. 1971, Thomas John Wakely, recent discharge from the United States Air Force joined the San Antonio office of the Texas campaign. His pay was room and board, $5.00 a week plus all of the menudo he could eat. The menudo was provided to the UFOC staff by the families of migrant workers working the Texas fields.

TJ worked for UFOC for about 2 years and his responsibilities included organizing the Grape Boycott in San Antonio. His primary target was the H-E-B grocery store chain. In addition, he attempted to organize Hispanic farm workers working the farmers market in San Antonio—an institution at that time controlled by the corporate farms. Among his many organizing activities included an early 1972 episode where he and several other UFOC staff members who were attempting to organize warehouse workers in San Antonio were fired upon by security agents of the corporate farm owners.

In mid-1973 the San Antonio office of the UFOC was taken over by the Brown Berets. This radicalization of the San Antonio UFOC office led to the eventual collapse of the San Antonio UFOC organizing campaign.

=== 1970s ===

In 1970, Chávez decided to move the union&#x27;s headquarters from Delano to La Paz, California, into a former sanatorium in the Tehachapi Mountains. Whereas Chávez thought this change would help create &quot;a national union of the poor ... serving the needs of all who suffer&quot;, other union members objected to this distancing of the leadership away from the farmworkers.

The union was poised to launch its next major campaign in the lettuce fields in 1970 when a deal between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the growers nearly destroyed it. Initially, the Teamsters signed contracts with lettuce growers in the Salinas Valley, who wanted to avoid recognizing the UFW. Then in 1973, when the three-year UFW grape contracts expired, the grape growers signed contracts giving the Teamsters the right to represent the workers who had been members of the UFW.

The UFW responded with strikes, lawsuits and boycotts, including secondary boycotts in the retail grocery industry. The union struggled to regain the members it had lost in the lettuce fields; it never fully recovered its strength in grapes, due in some part to incompetent management of the hiring halls it had established that seemed to favor some workers over others.

In 1972 the UFW opened the Terronez Clinic in Delano, California. The clinic was primarily staffed by volunteer doctors and nurses who recently graduated medical school along with and administrative staff made of local supporters. By the end of their first year, the clinic had served an estimated 23,000 farm workers and their families. Due to its success, the UFW opened other clinics in Calexico and Salinas. By 1978, UFW Executive Board decided to end the programs due to dwindling resources.

The battles in the fields became violent, with a number of UFW members killed on the picket line. The violence led the state in 1975 to enact the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act, creating an administrative agency, the ALRB, that oversaw secret ballot elections and resolved charges of unfair labor practices, like failing to bargain in good faith, or discrimination against activists. The UFW won the majority of secret ballot elections in which it participated.

In the late 1970s, the leadership of the UFW was wracked by a series of conflicts, as differences emerged between Chávez and some of his former colleagues. Trying to maintain union membership and strength, the UFW began to control the activities of local chapters which resulted in some longtime staffers resigning. Prominent Filipino activist Philip Vera Cruz also left the UFW in 1977 after Chavez accepted a invitation to visit the Philippines from the then dictator Ferdinand Marcos. In 1977, the Teamsters signed an agreement with the UFW promising to end their efforts to represent farm workers.

=== 1980s ===
In the 1980s, the membership of the UFW shrank, as did its national prominence. After taking office in the 1980s, California Governor George Deukmejian stopped enforcement of the state&#x27;s farm labor laws, resulting in farm workers losing their UFW contracts, being fired, and blacklisted. Due to internal squabbles, most of the union&#x27;s original leadership left or were forced out, except for Chávez and Huerta. By 1986, the union had been reduced to 75 contracts and had stopped organizing.

In the 1980s, the UFW joined with the AFL–CIO and other organizations for the national Wrath of Grapes campaign, reinstituting the grape boycott.

In the early 1980s, Tomas Villanueva, a well-known organizer who had a reputation for his activism for farm workers, agreed to help the UFW when they were in need of a leader for their march in Washington state. Villanueva joined César Chávez in organizing the boycotts and strikes that occurred in Washington state.

On September 21, 1986, Villanueva became the first president of the Washington state UFW. He was a great leader for the UFW activists in Washington since he led many strikes and influenced people to join the United Farm Workers movement. People who were against the movement started threatening leaders of the group such as Villanueva, but he continued organizing rallies. Even though there was some success in Washington state, the overall UFW membership started decreasing towards the end of the 1980s.

Additionally, there was a major scare over pesticides in California at the time; watermelons would make the farm workers and consumers very ill. The UFW was outraged to hear about the use of illegal pesticides, and Chávez decided to fast for 36 days to protest the dangers pesticides had on farm workers and their community. This influenced the legislature in California to create more food testing programs, resulting in pesticide-free produce, and to encourage organic farming.

=== Recent developments ===

In July 2008, farm worker Ramiro Carrillo Rodriguez, 48, died of a heat stroke. According to United Farm Workers, he was the &quot;13th farm worker heat death since CA Governor Schwarzenegger took office&quot; in 2003. In 2006 California&#x27;s first permanent heat regulations were enacted but these regulations were not strictly enforced, the union contended.

In 2013, farm workers working at a Fresno facility, for California&#x27;s largest peach producer, voted to de-certify the United Farm Workers. News of this decertification was released to the public in 2018.

&quot;César Chávez&quot; is a film released in March 2014, directed by Diego Luna about the life of the Mexican-American labor leader who co-founded the United Farm Workers. The film stars Michael Peña as Chávez. Co-producer John Malkovich also co-stars in the role of an owner of a large industrial grape farm who leads the sometimes violent opposition to Chávez&#x27;s organizing efforts.

The United Farm Workers of America&#x27;s work is dedicated to helping farm workers have the proper conditions in the work field and stand with them in the fight for equality. One of the issues that the UFW is constantly fighting for is the ongoing abuse that dairy workers at Darigold farms are facing. Darigold farms workers are known to have dealt with issues such as sexual harassment and wage theft. The UFW has taken an active role in a particular case called the &quot;Darigold Dozen&quot;.

The Darigold Dozen are 12 dairy farm workers from Washington who filed a lawsuit against Ruby Ridge Dairy in Pasco where they are employed, for wage theft. The UFW held a five-day fast on September 20, 2018, outside the Darigold headquarters to protest the poor work condition and treatments the Darigold farmers face and to bring attention to the Darigold Dozen. On May 8, 2019, the employers of the Darigold Dozen dropped their countersuit against their former employees and dropped a lawsuit that they had filed against the UFW.

The UFW continues to raise awareness on the treatment of Darigold farm workers and speaks out against Starbucks who buy their milk from the Darigold company. On the UFW website, they have flyers and videos about the conditions dairy farmers face, which they encourage people to share with others. Lastly, they have also emailed the CEO of Starbucks asking him to cut ties with Darigold company.

==Geography==
The grape strike officially began in Delano in September 1965. In December, union representatives traveled from California to New York, Washington, DC, Pittsburgh, Detroit, and other large cities to encourage a boycott of grapes grown at ranches without UFW contracts.

In the summer of 1966, unions and religious groups from Seattle and Portland endorsed the boycott. Supporters formed a boycott committee in Vancouver, prompting an outpouring of support from Canadians that continued throughout the following years.

In 1967, UFW supporters in Oregon began picketing stores in Eugene, Salem, and Portland. After melon workers went on strike in Texas, growers held the first union representation elections in the region, and the UFW became the first union to ever sign a contract with a grower in Texas.

National support for the UFW continued to grow in 1968, and hundreds of UFW members and supporters were arrested. Picketing continued throughout the country, including in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Florida. The mayors of New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Detroit, and other cities pledged their support, and many of them altered their cities&#x27; grape purchases to support the boycott.

In 1969, support for farm workers increased throughout North America. The grape boycott spread into the South as civil rights groups pressured grocery stores in Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Nashville, and Louisville to remove non-union grapes. Student groups in New York protested the Department of Defense and accused them of deliberately purchasing boycotted grapes. On May 10, UFW supporters picketed Safeway stores throughout the US and Canada in celebration of International Grape Boycott Day. César Chávez also went on a speaking tour along the East Coast to ask for support from labor groups, religious groups, and universities.

There were over 1,000 UFW strikes, boycotts, protests, and other farm worker actions between 1965 and 1975, as collected by &quot;El Macriado&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;New York Times&quot;, and &quot;Seattle Times&quot;.

Between 1965 and 1975 the United Farm Workers activism throughout the United States saw a tremendous increase. UFW started with the 7 states of California, New York, Washington, DC, Mississippi, Arizona, Illinois, and Texas. The movement and fight for change expanded to a total of 42 states in the span of 10 years.

Other organizations that followed in the United Farm Workers fight to empower and seek justice for farm workers are Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) (1967), Treeplanters &amp; Farmworkers United of the Northwest (PCUN) (1985), and Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) (1993).

===Immigration===
The UFW during Chávez&#x27;s tenure was committed to restricting immigration. Chávez and other like-minded individuals advocated for enforcement of laws such as the Alien Contract Labor Act of 1885 to fight the influx of people that could hurt their cause. Chávez and Dolores Huerta, co-founder and president of the UFW, fought the Bracero Program that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition was due to their belief that the program undermined US workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964.

On a few occasions, concerns that illegal immigrant labor would undermine UFW strike campaigns led to controversial events. The UFW describes these as anti-strikebreaking events, but some have also interpreted them as anti-immigrant. In 1969, Chávez and members of the UFW marched through the Imperial and Coachella Valleys to the border of Mexico to protest growers&#x27; use of illegal immigrants as strikebreakers. The UFW and Chávez reported illegal immigrants who served as strikebreaking replacement workers (as well as those who refused to unionize) to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

In 1973, the United Farm Workers set up a &quot;wet line&quot; along the United States-Mexico border to prevent Mexican immigrants from entering the United States illegally and undermining the UFW&#x27;s unionization efforts. During one such event, in which Chávez was not involved, some UFW members, under the guidance of Chávez&#x27;s cousin Manuel, physically attacked the strikebreakers after peaceful attempts to persuade them not to cross the border failed.

In 1979, Chávez denounced the US Immigration and Naturalization Service in a US Senate hearing for the former&#x27;s refusal to arrest illegal Mexican immigrants whom Chávez said were being used as strikebreakers.

After the passing of Chávez, the United Farm Workers shifted their stance towards immigration and began advocating for undocumented immigrants and campaign against Proposition 187.

== Roles ==
The role of César Chávez, a co-founder of UFW, was to frame his campaigns in terms of consumer safety and involving social justice, bringing benefits to the farmworker unions. One of UFW&#x27;s, along with Chávez&#x27;s, important aspects that has been overlooked is building coalitions.

The United Farm Workers allows farmworkers to help improve their working conditions and wages. The UFW embraces nonviolence in its attempt to cultivate members on political and social issues.

The union publicly adopted the principles of non-violence championed by Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. On July 22, 2005, the UFW announced that it was joining the Change to Win Federation (now known as the Strategic Organizing Center), a coalition of labor unions functioning as an alternative to the AFL–CIO. On January 13, 2006, the union officially disaffiliated from the AFL–CIO. In contrast to other Change to Win-affiliated unions, the AFL–CIO neglected to offer the right of affiliation to regional bodies to the UFW.

<doc id="294514" wikidata="Q4446218" url="?curid=294514" title="Superdeformation">
<text>In nuclear physics a superdeformed nucleus is a nucleus that is very far from spherical, forming an ellipsoid with axes in ratios of approximately 2:1:1. Normal deformation is approximately 1.3:1:1. Only some nuclei can exist in superdeformed states.

The first superdeformed states to be observed were the fission isomers, low-spin states of elements in the actinide series. The strong force decays much faster than the Coulomb force, which becomes stronger when nucleons are greater than 2.5 femtometers apart. For this reason, these elements undergo spontaneous fission. In the late 1980s, high-spin superdeformed rotational bands were observed in other regions of the periodic table. Specific elements include ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, and mercury.

The existence of superdeformed states occurs because of a combination of macroscopic and microscopic factors, which together lower their energies, and make them stable minima of energy as a function of deformation. Macroscopically, the nucleus can be described by the liquid drop model. The liquid drop&#x27;s energy as a function of deformation is at a minimum for zero deformation, due to the surface tension term. However, the curve may become soft with respect to high deformations because of the Coulomb repulsion (especially for the fission isomers, which have high Z) and also, in the case of high-spin states, because of the increased moment of inertia. Modulating this macroscopic behavior, the microscopic shell correction creates certain superdeformed magic numbers that are analogous to the spherical magic numbers. For nuclei near these magic numbers, the shell correction creates a second minimum in the energy as a function of deformation.

Even more deformed states (3:1) are called hyperdeformed.

<text>Todd Anthony Shaw (born April 28, 1966), better known by his stage name Too Short (stylized as Too $hort), is an American rapper. A pioneer of West Coast hip-hop, Shaw was among the first acts to receive recognition in the genre during the late 1980s. His lyrics were often based on pimping and promiscuity, but also drug culture and street survival; exemplified respectively in his most popular singles &quot;Blow the Whistle&quot; and &quot;The Ghetto.&quot; He is one of few acts to have worked with both Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G. during the heights of their respective careers. 

Shaw began recording in 1983, and cultivated a regional following with three independent projects tailored for his native Oakland. His fourth album, &quot;Born to Mack&quot; (1987) sold an estimated 50,000 units from Shaw&#x27;s car trunk, leading to a commercial re-issue by Jive Records the following year. His fifth album, &quot;Life Is... Too Short&quot; (1989), received double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and became his first entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. His sixth album, &quot;Short Dog&#x27;s In The House&quot; (1990), peaked at number 20 on the chart and spawned the single &quot;The Ghetto,&quot; which became his first and highest-charting entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as a lead artist. His following four albums—&quot;Shorty the Pimp&quot; (1992), &quot;Get in Where You Fit In&quot; (1993), &quot;Cocktails&quot; (1995), and &quot;Gettin&#x27; It (Album Number Ten)&quot; (1996)—each peaked within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received platinum certifications by the RIAA. 

In 1988, he formed the group the Dangerous Crew with Oakland-based rappers and producers, and in 2020, he formed the West Coast hip hop group Mount Westmore with frequent collaborators Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg and E-40. In 2006, he founded the record label Up All Nite Records, through which he signed hyphy group the Pack (which included then-unknown rapper Lil B).

==Early life==
Shaw was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. In 1980, he and his family moved to Oakland. He was a drummer in the band at Fremont High School in Oakland.

==Career==
In the mid-1980s, Shaw, along with high school friend Freddy B, produced custom songs (called &quot;special requests&quot;) locally on cassette for people in Oakland and the Bay Area. In 1985, Too Short started his solo career and released his debut album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Rappin&#x27;&quot; on Oakland record label 75 Girls Records And Tapes which, along with four 12&quot; releases, featured raw, simple drum beats from a LinnDrum drum machine. This was also one of the first hip hop recordings to use the word &quot;bitch&quot; – a word which became one of the rapper&#x27;s trademarks and was the focus of subsequent songs such as &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; but a Word to Me&quot;.

In the early 1990s, his self-produced beats came from mostly a TR-808 and from mid-to-late 2000s, a TR-909 was used. In 1985, Too Short and Freddie B. formed the label Dangerous Music to regionally distribute his music, and with others formed rap group the Dangerous Crew. Dangerous Music became Short Records, and then Up All Nite Records. With his 1989 album, &quot;Life Is... Too Short&quot;, he began using replayed established funk riffs (rather than samples) with his beats.

Subsequent work was primarily collaborative, including work with Tupac Shakur, the Notorious B.I.G., Scarface, and Pimp C. One of his notable collaborations during this period was on the track &quot;The World Is Filled...&quot; on the Notorious B.I.G. album &quot;Life After Death&quot;; he comes in on the third verse after Diddy and Biggie. Being featured on the album introduced him to a wider audience as well, due to his typical style contrasting greatly with the Mafioso theme of the album. He also appeared on TWDY&#x27;s hit single &quot;Player&#x27;s Holiday&quot; from their 1999 debut album &quot;Derty Werk&quot; as well as the Priority Records compilation &quot;Nuthin but a Gangsta Party&quot;. After these appearances, he began working on his eleventh album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stay Away&quot;. The album included guest appearances by 8Ball &amp; MJG, Jay-Z, Jermaine Dupri, Sean Combs, E-40, Daz Dillinger, Lil Jon, Soopafly, Scarface and B-Legit.

Too Short relocated to Atlanta in 1994, but he did not begin working with a more diverse variety of Southern artists until 2000, when he collaborated with Lil Jon. With the 1999 release of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stay Away&quot;, Too Short came out of retirement, continuing his sexually explicit, relaxed style of rap. New albums released 2000–2003 were &quot;You Nasty&quot; (2000), &quot;Chase the Cat&quot; (2001), &quot;What&#x27;s My Favorite Word?&quot; (2002), and &quot;Married to the Game&quot; (2003). These albums all charted fairly well, as they all were in the top 71 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but they did not do as well as Too Short&#x27;s earlier 1990s releases, as none of them reached the top 10.

For his next album, &quot;Blow the Whistle&quot; (2006), Too Short now took advantage of the new hyphy rap music that was emerging out of his original home base in Oakland. This saw somewhat of a resurgence for Too Short as it peaked at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, much better than each of his previous three releases. However, his subsequent releases, such as 2007&#x27;s &quot;Get Off the Stage&quot;, have not been as successful. On October 7, 2008, Too Short was honored by VH1 at the fifth annual &quot;Hip-Hop Honors&quot; along with Cypress Hill, De La Soul, Slick Rick and Naughty By Nature.

In 2009, Too Short recorded for Daz Dillinger, Lil Jon, Soopafly, Scarface and B-Legit. In 2011, the rapper was featured on Wiz Khalifa&#x27;s song &quot;On My Level&quot;. He also collaborated in Snoop Dogg&#x27;s 2011 album, &quot;Doggumentary&quot; in the song &quot;Take U Home&quot; and on the 50 Cent song &quot;First Date&quot;. In 2012 Too Short along with E-40 released two collaboration albums on the same day titled &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Both charted in the top 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. Too Short has said the best verse he has ever recorded is a verse for a song on Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;Detox&quot; called &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend (Pussy)&quot;.

In 2013, it was announced he would collaborate with Lady Gaga on a song &quot;Jewels n&#x27; Drugs&quot; for her upcoming album &quot;Artpop&quot;. Also featured on the song are T.I. and Twista.

In 2015, Too Short was featured on actor Tavion Tate Guice&#x27;s song &quot;Oakland Brookfield Dance&quot;.

In 2016, Too Short was featured on the song &quot;Cochino&quot; by Argentine-American rapper Dumbfoundead. The song is the seventh track off of Dumbfoundead&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;We Might Die&quot;.

Six years after his last release, Too Short released his 20th album &quot;The Pimp Tape&quot; on November 9, 2018. On December 20, 2019, he released his 21st album &quot;The Vault&quot;. On December 18, 2020, Too Short and E-40 released their collaboration album &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gone Do It and Terms &amp; Conditions&quot;.
In 2022, the City of Oakland honored Too Short with a commemorative street sign declaring a section of Foothill Boulevard &quot;Too $hort Way&quot; and proclaiming December 10, 2022 to be &quot;Too $hort Day.&quot;

==Up All Nite Records==
In the mid-2000s, Shaw re-launched his Dangerous Music label into Up All Nite Records, a subsidiary imprint of Jive Records. He signed fellow California acts including the hip hop group the Pack. In 2017, he co-founded the &quot;digital&quot; record label OG Records with Vinny Az, which also aims as a platform for regional artists.

In September 2019, Shaw and his partner Sue Ivy announced the birth of their first child, a daughter.

Since 2006, Shaw has been a mentor at Youth UpRising, an Oakland-based non-profit which supports at-risk youths.

&quot;Serial Mom&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on April 13, 1994, to mixed reviews from critics and grossed nearly $8 million. The film is regarded as a cult classic.

==Plot==
Beverly Sutphin appears to be an unassuming upper-middle-class housewife living with her dentist husband Eugene and their teenage children, Misty and Chip, in Towson, Maryland. In truth, she is a serial killer who murders people over trivial slights or offenses.

One morning, detectives Pike and Gracey question the family about the vulgar telephone harassment of their neighbor, Dottie Hinkle. It is later revealed that Beverly is the perpetrator, and began harassing Dottie after she took a parking space from Beverly. Later that day, Beverly vengefully runs over Chip&#x27;s math teacher, Mr. Stubbins, with her car after he condemns Chip&#x27;s interest in horror films at a PTA meeting. Later, Misty is upset when her crush, Carl, stands her up for a date. Beverly spots Carl with another girl at a swap meet and fatally stabs him with a fire poker.

Eugene discovers serial killer memorabilia beneath his and Beverly&#x27;s mattress, which includes recordings from Ted Bundy in the week of his execution. During dinner that evening, Chip mentions his friend Scotty&#x27;s suspicions about Beverly being the killer. Beverly leaves, leaving the family afraid that she intends to kill Scotty in order to silence him. They race to Scotty&#x27;s house; Beverly, however, intends to kill Ralph and Betty Sterner, a couple who had called Eugene to treat the former&#x27;s toothache on a day Eugene and Beverly planned to spend birdwatching. She stabs Betty with scissors and pushes an air conditioner from the window onto Ralph. The rest of the family and the police arrive at Scotty&#x27;s house, only to find him masturbating to a porn film.

Police follow the Sutphins to church on that Sunday as Beverly is named as the prime suspect in the Sterners&#x27; murders. The service abruptly ends when everyone flees in panic after Beverly sneezes; in the confusion, Beverly escapes as police attempt to arrest her. She hides at the video store where Chip is employed. Chip encounters regular customer Mrs. Jenson and fines her for neglecting to rewind her rented videotapes before returning them, whereupon she insults him. Beverly follows her home and fatally strikes her with a leg of lamb as she watches &quot;Annie&quot;. Scotty witnesses the attack nearby, but Beverly discovers him and gives chase, eventually concluding at a heavy metal bar. Beverly immolates Scotty during a rock concert. The Sutphins arrive as Beverly is arrested.

Beverly&#x27;s trial becomes a media sensation. Beverly&#x27;s lawyer claims that she is not guilty by reason of insanity, but is promptly dismissed when Beverly asks to defend herself. Beverly proves to be formidable when she systematically discredits every witness against her by exploiting their own vices or otherwise casting doubt on their testimony. Luann Hodges, the only witness who actually saw her commit a crime, is intoxicated and thus unable to provide credible testimony. The courtroom is distracted by the arrival of Suzanne Somers, who has been cast as Beverly in a television film.

Beverly is acquitted of all charges. She expresses contempt for one juror for wearing white shoes after Labor Day. Beverly follows her to a payphone alcove and fatally strikes her with the receiver. Somers angers Beverly into an outburst while attempting to pose for a photo op. The juror&#x27;s body is then discovered, and Beverly gives Somers a knowing look. It is implied that Beverly has been imprisoned.

==Cast==
==Production==
Actresses considered for the role of Beverly Sutphin before Turner was cast included Meryl Streep, Kathy Bates, Glenn Close, and Julie Andrews.

Films by Waters&#x27; creative influences, including Doris Wishman, Otto Preminger, William Castle, and Herschell Gordon Lewis, are seen playing on television sets throughout the film.

The audio for Ted Bundy in one of Beverly&#x27;s correspondences with the jailed killer is the voice of Waters.

===Post-production===
The film had a troubled post-production, marked by conflict between Waters and Savoy Pictures. In his 2019 book &quot;Mr. Know-It-All&quot;, Waters states that studio executives who viewed an early cut objected to its violence and dark comedy. They demanded the film be substantially re-edited and given a different ending, which Waters refused to do. Acrimony between the two sides intensified following a poor test screening, which Waters believed was deliberately held before a conservative audience unlikely to enjoy the film. He contrasted it with a more receptive screening for members of the film industry in Los Angeles. Turner spoke about the ordeal to gossip columnist Liz Smith, who was a friend. Smith intervened with a column titled &quot;Leave Serial Mom Alone&quot;, publicizing the situation, and Savoy eventually relented on its demands.

==Music==
The film&#x27;s score was composed by Basil Poledouris, performed by the Utah Symphony and recorded in Salt Lake City, Utah. The American rock band L7 appears in the film as the band Camel Lips, and performs the song &quot;Gas Chamber&quot;, which was written by L7 with lyrical contributions by Waters. The film also features the song &quot;Daybreak&quot; by Barry Manilow. To discourage its use in this film, the copyright owners of the song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; from the 1982 film &quot;Annie&quot;, which is heard during a murder, quoted a high royalty fee of $60,000, but the studio paid the amount.

==Release==
&quot;Serial Mom&quot; was screened out of competition as the closing night film at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival.

===Home media===
Universal Studios and Focus Features released a collector&#x27;s edition DVD of the film on May 6, 2008, replacing the original HBO Home Video DVD release, which is out of print. The DVD release features an audio commentary with Waters and Turner. The film was released as a Collector&#x27;s Edition Blu-ray from Shout! Factory on May 9, 2017.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened on April 13, 1994, and grossed $2 million in its opening weekend, ranking number 11 at the US box office. By the end of its run, the film had grossed $7.8 million in the United States and Canada. The film has become a cult classic since its release.

===Critical response===

Roger Ebert awarded it two stars out of a possible four. While he found some of Waters&#x27; satire effective, he felt that Kathleen Turner&#x27;s decision to portray her character&#x27;s mental illness with realism as opposed to a campy fashion, while brave, made the character difficult to laugh at. He wrote, &quot;Watch &quot;Serial Mom&quot; closely and you&#x27;ll realize that something is miscalculated at a fundamental level. Turner&#x27;s character is helpless and unwitting in a way that makes us feel almost sorry for her—and that undermines the humor. She isn&#x27;t funny crazy, she&#x27;s sick crazy.&quot;

Other critics were more enthusiastic about the film and Turner&#x27;s performance. &quot;Time Out&quot; said the film boasts &quot;an uproariously funny, marvellously malicious performance from Turner&quot;, and Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Turner &quot;furiously funny&quot;. Rainer described the film as &quot;a jab at the supposed uplift provided by &#x27;wholesome&#x27; TV shows and movies. With all the ruckus raised in the media about the harmful effects of on-screen violence and sex, &quot;Serial Mom&quot; weighs in for the other side: It implies that it&#x27;s the antiseptic family entertainments that may have done us the real harm. The &quot;real&quot; nut cases in the movie aren&#x27;t the hormonally inflamed teen-agers and avenging matriarchs. It&#x27;s the suburban Baltimore do-gooders, the upright judges and deacons--you know, the pillars of society.&quot; Critics also lauded the satirization of America&#x27;s obsession with true crime and celebrity, such as when Beverly&#x27;s daughter, Misty, is seen selling T-shirts outside the courthouse where her mother&#x27;s fate will be decided, and a joke disclaimer at the beginning falsely claiming the film&#x27;s events are &quot;based on a true story&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; critic Eric Henderson called &quot;Serial Mom&quot; &quot;the strongest film of the post-midnight-movie chapter of John Waters&#x27;s career.&quot;

Later reviews suggested that the trial in &quot;Serial Mom&quot; presaged the media coverage of the 1995 murder trial of O. J. Simpson.

<doc id="294523" wikidata="Q413018" url="?curid=294523" title="Bromotrifluoromethane">
<text>Bromotrifluoromethane, commonly referred to by the code numbers Halon 1301, R13B1, Halon 13B1 or BTM, is an organic halide with the chemical formula CBrF3. It is used for gaseous fire suppression as a far less toxic alternative to bromochloromethane.

== Table of physical properties ==

== Synthesis ==
Bromotrifluoromethane is commercially synthesized in a two-step process from chloroform. Chloroform is fluorinated with hydrogen fluoride.

CHCl3 + 3 HF → CHF3 + 3 HCl

The resulting Fluoroform is then reacted with elemental bromine.

CHF3 + Br2 → CF3Br + HBr

== Uses ==
Halon 1301 was developed in a joint venture between the U.S. Army and Purdue University in the late 1940&#x27;s, and became a DuPont product in 1954. It was introduced as an effective gaseous fire suppression fixed systems agent in the 1960s, and was used around valuable materials, such as aircraft, mainframe computers, and telecommunication switching centers, usually in total flooding systems. It was also widely used in the maritime industry to add a third level of protection should the main and emergency fire pumps become inoperable or ineffective. Halon 1301 was never widely used in portables outside marine, military and spacecraft applications, due to its limited range, and invisible discharge. It does not produce the characteristic white cloud like CO2 and is difficult to direct when fighting large fires. Halon 1301 is ideal for armored vehicles and spacecraft, because it produces fewer toxic by-products than does Halon 1211, which is critical for combat or space conditions where a compartment may not be able to be ventilated immediately. Halon 1301 is widely used by the U.S. Military and NASA in a 2-3/4 lb portable extinguisher with a sealed, disposable cylinder for quick recharging. Other agents such as CO2 and FE-36 (HFC-236fa) wet chemical are largely replacing halon 1301 for environmental concerns. Civilian models in 2-3/4, 3, and 4 lb sizes were also made.

It is considered good practice to avoid all unnecessary exposure to Halon 1301, and to limit exposures to concentrations of 7% and below to 15 minutes. Exposure to Halon 1301 in the 5% to 7% range produces little, if any, noticeable effect. At levels between 7% and 10%, mild central nervous system effects such as dizziness and tingling in the extremities have been reported. In practice, the operators of many Halon 1301 total flooding systems evacuate the space on impending agent discharge.

Halon systems are among the most effective and commonly used fire protection systems used on commercial aircraft. Halon 1301 is the primary agent used in commercial aviation engine, cargo compartments, and auxiliary power unit fire zones. Efforts to find a suitable replacement for Halon 1301 have not produced a widely accepted replacement.

Bromotrifluoromethane was also used as a filling of the bubble chamber in the neutrino detector Gargamelle.

Before the dangers of Halon 1301 as an ozone depleter were known, many industrial chillers used it as an efficient refrigerant gas.

===Chemical reagent===
It is a precursor to trifluoromethyltrimethylsilane, a popular trifluoromethylating reagent in organic synthesis.

== Alternatives ==
Alternatives for normally occupied areas include (PFC-410 or CEA-410), C3F8 (PFC-218 or CEA-308), HCFC Blend A (NAF S-III), HFC-23 (FE 13), HFC-227ea (FM 200), IG-01 (argon), IG-55 (argonite), HFC-125, or HFC-134a. For normally unoccupied areas, the alternatives include carbon dioxide, powdered Aerosol C, CF3I, HCFC-22, HCFC-124, HFC-125, HFC-134a, gelled halocarbon/dry chemical suspension (PGA), blend of inert gas, high expansion foam systems and powdered aerosol (FS 0140), and IG-541 (Inergen).
Perfluorocarbons, i.e., PFCs such as C3F8, have very long atmospheric lifetimes and very high global warming potentials. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, i.e., HCFCs including HCFC containing NAF S-III, contain chlorine and are stratospheric ozone layer depleters, although less so than Halon 1301. Their selection for usage as Halon replacements should consider those factors, and is restricted in some countries.

<text>Belfast City Airport, officially George Best Belfast City Airport , is an international airport in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Situated in County Down, it is adjacent to the Belfast Harbour and is from Belfast City Centre. It shares the site with the Spirit AeroSystems (formerly Short Brothers/Bombardier) aircraft manufacturing facility. The airport began commercial operations in 1983, and was known as &quot;Belfast City Airport&quot; until it was renamed in 2006 in memory of George Best, the professional footballer from Belfast. The airport has a CAA public use aerodrome licence (number P862) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction.

As of February 2024, 6 airlines operate 30 routes across the UK and Europe from Belfast City Airport. In 2024, the airport handled over 2.3 million passengers, having peaked at 2.7 million in 2010. 
The airport serves as a regional base for Aer Lingus and British Airways who are the largest operators there. Ground handling is provided by Swissport and Menzies Aviation, the latter also offering cargo handling services.

==History==
===Early years===
Sydenham Airport was established by Shorts beside its Belfast factory at Sydenham in 1937. It was opened on 16 March 1938 by Anne Chamberlain, the wife of then British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain. The inaugural flight was to Glasgow, Scotland. This became Belfast&#x27;s main civilian airport from 1938 to 1939. The airfield was requisitioned by the RAF as RAF Belfast in 1941, then transferred to the Royal Navy, becoming &quot;HMS Gadwall&quot; (also known as RNAS Belfast or RNAS Sydenham) in 1943. RAF Nutts Corner then became Belfast&#x27;s main airport (while Aldergrove would later become the primary airport in Northern Ireland).

In 1952, the runway was extended to its present . The airfield at Sydenham continued to be used for military purposes until the 1970s (reverting to RAF Belfast in 1973 and closing in 1978), including a period of use by the Fleet Air Arm as a naval aircraft storage unit. After this, it was used solely by Shorts.

In 1983, following interest from airlines and customers, the airfield was opened for commercial flights as &quot;Belfast Harbour Airport&quot; (subsequently &quot;Belfast City Airport&quot; and then with its current name). Its IATA airport code &quot;BHD&quot; refers to &quot;Belfast Harbour&quot; and to its location in County Down. Jersey European began operations at the airport in 1988. At the time of its demise in 2020, the airline - by then called Flybe - operated a large base from the airport.

===Development from 2000 to 2019===
A new terminal was officially opened on 3 June 2001. Following major capital investment Bombardier sold the airport in 2003 for £35 million to the Spanish company Ferrovial, the owner of BAA Airports. Ferrovial re-sold the airport in September 2008 for £132.5 million to ABN Amro Global Infrastructure Fund.

In March 2006, it was announced that the airport would be renamed in memory of Northern Irish footballer George Best. The new name, &quot;George Best Belfast City Airport&quot;, and signage were revealed at the renaming ceremony attended by Best&#x27;s family and friends on 22 May 2006, which would have been Best&#x27;s 60th birthday. The renaming of the airport caused controversy, with many articles in local and national print media highlighting the mixed feelings of Belfast residents. Also in March 2006 Flybe announced that it would be naming its Belfast City – Manchester service after the footballer, dedicating a plane to him.

In October 2007 Ryanair established its 23rd base at the airport, operating five routes and carrying 800,000 annual passengers. The airline closed its Belfast City base in 2010 due to delays in the planned runway extension. The airline stated that would fly to European destinations from the airport if the runway was extended.

In January 2010 easyJet commenced flights to London Luton, though the airline moved the route back to Belfast International in 2011.

Manx2 moved its Isle of Man service to the airport in 2010, however the airline has since ceased operations.

In January 2011 Bmibaby moved its Belfast base to the airport, in order to keep its operation under one roof with sister airline BMI. The airline ceased operations from Belfast City Airport in June 2012.

In October 2012 Aer Lingus moved its services from Belfast International to the airport. The airline launched flights to five destinations, though it has since reduced their operations to just one route. Spanish carrier Vueling launched summer-seasonal flights to Barcelona in May 2015, though the route was cancelled in late 2015. Dutch carrier KLM launched daily flights to Amsterdam in 2015, with flights operated by KLM Cityhopper. Brussels Airlines launched flights to Brussels in 2016, though the airline axed the route in 2017. In early 2017, Eastern Airways commenced flights to the Isle of Man following the demise of Citywing, though the airline axed the route in 2018. Icelandic carrier Air Iceland Connect commenced flights to Keflavik in 2017 on behalf of Icelandair, though the route was cancelled in 2018. Scottish airline Loganair commenced operations to Carlisle in 2019, followed by Dundee in 2020.

===2020 to present===
Flybe, which operated 80% of flights at the airport, and carried over 1.6 million passengers across 14 routes, ceased operations in March 2020. Subsequently, Loganair commenced flights to Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Inverness, while Eastern Airways commenced flights to Cardiff and Southampton. In addition, British Airways subsidiary BA CityFlyer commenced flights to London City during 2020.

In August 2020, Aer Lingus subsidiary Aer Lingus Regional established a new base at the airport, operating five aircraft to six UK destinations. In June 2021, Aer Lingus Regional operator Stobart Air ceased operations, leading to the cancellation of all Aer Lingus Regional flights. Aer Lingus and British Airways commenced flights to the majority of Aer Lingus Regional&#x27;s destinations from Belfast City Airport.

Ryanair resumed flying from the airport after a hiatus of around 11 years, on 1 June 2021, but announced in late August 2021 that it would withdraw from Northern Ireland altogether in September 2021, in protest at the UK&#x27;s Air Passenger Duty, and the lack of post-Covid incentives for airlines.
In March 2022, Emerald Airlines, the new operator of Aer Lingus Regional flights, announced that they would be opening a base at the airport. Initially with a base of three ATR-72-600 aircraft, Emerald plan on serving six UK destinations from 24 March 2022 under the Aer Lingus brand, with Aer Lingus itself operating the London Heathrow route.

On the 16 March 2022, the new Flybe announced that the airport would become their second operating base following their spring relaunch, with flights going on sale the following week. The base was closed in January 2023 when Flybe 2.0 went into administration.

In October 2022, it was announced that Aer Lingus operations between Belfast City and London Heathrow would transfer to Aer Lingus UK due to Brexit related requirements that a European carrier could no longer fly domestic routes within the United Kingdom. These flights are operated by British Airways under wet-lease terms using the Aer Lingus UK flight numbers and callsigns. This currently does not affect the operations carried out by Emerald Airlines from Belfast City as an agreement is currently in place between the UK CAA, British Airways and themselves prior to Emerald Airlines securing a UK AOC.

In July 2024, the airport launched an advertising campaign, new website, and logo featuring the name &#x27;Belfast City Airport,&#x27; omitting &#x27;George Best&#x27; from its branding. The airport later clarified that while the campaign excluded his name, the signage above the door remained unchanged, and its official business name and airport registration would continue as &#x27;George Best Belfast City Airport&#x27;.

==Expansion plans and objections==

As the airport is adjacent to residential areas, the issue of noise pollution is a major source of public debate. The airport has developed a noise management strategy following the making of a planning agreement, under which the airport operates, and has established operational noise abatement procedures.

The airport applied for a complete removal of the limit on the seats it could sell in 2013 – a key element of the 1997 planning agreement, which was designed to guard against over-expansion. As a result, numerous residents&#x27; groups formed a coalition – The Coalition Against Belfast City Airport Expansion – to protest against the airport&#x27;s proposed expansion plans, and to represent the views of residents at the Examination in Public held during 2006.

Restrictions applied to the airport include:
* The requirement for flights to be scheduled between 6:30 am and 9:30 pm. The exception to this is for delayed flights where extensions until 11 pm may be granted. 
* That there would be a limit of 45,000 commercial (and unlimited general aviation) aircraft movements in any year, restricted further in 2008 to 48,000 combined commercial and general aviation aircraft movements.
* That airlines must not offer more than 4 million seats for sale on flights from the airport per year.
* The majority of flights must approach and depart the airport over Belfast Lough (currently 52% as of April 2017), rather than over the city of Belfast.
* Any flight departing over the lough must turn left to head north (further from land) at 500 feet. Only after reaching 2,000 feet (for turboprops) or 3,000 feet (for jet aircraft) may they then turn south to move over land again.
* Any flight departing over the city must fly in a straight line until 2,000 feet (for turboprop aircraft) or 3,000 feet (for jet aircraft) before being allowed to turn.

<text>Anthony Grove Hillerman (May 27, 1925 – October 26, 2008) was an American author of detective novels and nonfiction works, best known for his mystery novels featuring Navajo Nation Police officers Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee. Several of his works have been adapted for film and television.

==Biography==
Tony Hillerman was born in Sacred Heart, Oklahoma, to August Alfred Hillerman, a farmer and shopkeeper, and his wife, Lucy Grove. He was the youngest of their three children, and the second son. His paternal grandparents were born in Germany, and his maternal grandparents were born in England. He was a first cousin once removed of actor John Hillerman. He grew up in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, attending elementary and high school with Potawatomi children.

Jeffrey Herlihy argues that this background made possible &quot;a significantly different portrayal of Native Americans in his writing&quot;, in comparison to other authors of his time. &quot;Most obviously important,&quot; Hillerman said of his childhood, &quot;was growing up knowing that Indians are just like everybody else. You grew up without an &#x27;us and them&#x27; attitude about other races.&quot;

Hillerman was a decorated combat veteran of World War II, serving from August 1943 to October 1945 as a mortarman in the 103rd Infantry Division in the European theatre. He earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and a Purple Heart. He was wounded in 1945, and the injuries included broken legs, foot, and ankle, facial burns, and temporary blindness. 

Hillerman attended the University of Oklahoma after the war, meeting Marie Unzner, a student in microbiology. The couple wed and had one biological child and five adopted children. He graduated in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in journalism.

From 1948 to 1962, he worked as a journalist, moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1952. In 1966, he moved his family to Albuquerque, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree from the University of New Mexico. During his time as a writer for the &quot;Borger News-Herald&quot; in Borger, Texas, he became acquainted with the sheriff of Hutchinson County, the man upon whom he would pattern the main character in his Joe Leaphorn novels. He taught journalism from 1966 to 1987 at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, and also began writing novels. He lived there with his wife Marie until his death in 2008. At the time of his death, they had been married 60 years and had 10 grandchildren.

A consistently bestselling author, he was ranked as New Mexico&#x27;s 22nd-wealthiest man in 1996. He wrote 18 books in his Navajo series. He wrote more than 30 books total, among them a memoir and books about the Southwest, its beauty, and its history. His literary honors were awarded for his Navajo books. Hillerman&#x27;s books have been translated into eight languages, among them Danish and Japanese.

Hillerman&#x27;s writing is noted for the cultural details he provides about his subjects: Hopi, Zuni, European settlers, federal agents, and especially the Navajo Nation Police. His works in nonfiction and in fiction reflect his appreciation of the natural wonders of the American Southwest and his appreciation of its indigenous people, particularly the Navajo. His mystery novels are set in the Four Corners area of New Mexico and Arizona, sometimes reaching into Colorado and Utah, with occasional forays to the big cities of Washington, DC, Los Angeles, and New York City. The protagonists are Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee of the Navajo Nation Police. Lt. Leaphorn was introduced in Hillerman&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Blessing Way&quot; (1970). Sgt. Jim Chee was introduced in the fourth novel, &quot;People of Darkness&quot;. The two first work together in the seventh novel, &quot;Skinwalkers&quot;, considered his breakout novel, with a distinct increase in sales with the two police officers working together.

Hillerman repeatedly acknowledged his debt to an earlier series of mystery novels written by British-born Australian author Arthur W. Upfield and set among Australian Aborigines in remote desert regions of tropical and subtropical Australia. The Upfield novels were first published in 1928 and featured a half-European, half-aboriginal Australian hero, Detective-Inspector Napoleon (Bony) Bonaparte. Bony worked with deep understanding of Aboriginal traditions. The character was based on the achievements of an Aboriginal person known as Tracker Leon, whom Upfield had met during his years in the Australian bush.

Hillerman discussed his debt to Upfield in many interviews and in his introduction to the posthumous 1984 reprint of Upfield&#x27;s &quot;A Royal Abduction.&quot; In the introduction, he described the appeal of the descriptions in Upfield&#x27;s crime novels. It was descriptions both of the harsh Outback areas and of &quot;the people who somehow survived upon them&quot; that lured him. &quot;When my own Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police unravels a mystery because he understands the ways of his people, when he reads the signs in the sandy bottom of a reservation arroyo, he is walking in the tracks Bony made 50 years ago.&quot;

He also mentioned Eric Ambler, Graham Greene, and Raymond Chandler as authors who influenced him as he wrote the Leaphorn and Chee novels.

In an interview published in &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Hillerman said his Navajo name means &quot;He who is afraid of his horse&quot;.

Tony Hillerman died on October 26, 2008, of pulmonary failure in Albuquerque at the age of 83, and was interred at Santa Fe National Cemetery.

==Recognition beyond the US==

Hillerman&#x27;s novels were popular in France. Hillerman credits that popularity both to French curiosity about other cultures and to his translator, Pierre Bondil.

==Legacy and honors==

Hillerman is considered one of New Mexico&#x27;s foremost novelists. The Tony Hillerman Library was dedicated in Albuquerque in 2008, and the Tony Hillerman Middle School (part of Volcano Vista High School) opened in 2009. &quot;Dance Hall of the Dead&quot;, published in 1973, earned Hillerman the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière in 1987, a French international literary honor. Hillerman was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Literature (Litt.D.) from the University of New Mexico in 1990. He was awarded the Owen Wister Award in 2008 for &quot;Outstanding Contributions to the American West.&quot;

==Awards==
Hillerman was a decorated combat veteran of World War II; he earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart as a mortarman in the 103rd Infantry Division.

He won and was nominated for numerous awards for his writing and his work with other writers. His first nomination came in 1972, with his novel &quot;The Fly on the Wall&quot; being nominated for an Edgar Award in the &quot;Best Mystery Novel&quot; category. Two years later his novel &quot;Dance Hall of the Dead&quot;, second book in the Leaphorn-Chee series, won the 1974 Edgar Award for Best Novel. He was again nominated for the &quot;Best Mystery Novel&quot; Edgar Award in 1979 for &quot;Listening Woman&quot; and lastly in 1989 for &quot;A Thief of Time&quot;. Hillerman&#x27;s non-fictional work &quot;Talking Mysteries&quot; was nominated in 1992 for the Edgar Award in the &quot;Best Critical or Biographical&quot; category.

In 1987, Hillerman received the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière for &quot;Dance Hall of the Dead&quot;. In 1991, Hillerman received the MWA&#x27;s Grand Master Award. Hillerman received the Nero Award for &quot;Coyote Waits&quot; and the Navajo Tribe&#x27;s Special Friends of the Dineh Award.

Hillerman has also been successful at the annual Anthony Awards. His novel &quot;Skinwalkers&quot; won the 1988 Anthony Award for &quot;Best Novel&quot;, and in the following year &quot;A Thief of Time&quot; was nominated for the 1989 Anthony Award in the same category. His next nomination was for his &quot;Talking Mysteries&quot; non-fictional work which was nominated at the 1992 Anthony Awards. His novel &quot;Sacred Clowns&quot; received a &quot;Best Novel&quot; nomination at the 1994 Anthony Awards, and the following year his short-story collection &quot;The Mysterious West&quot; won the 1995 Anthony Award in the &quot;Best Anthology/Short Story Collection&quot; category. His last win came at the 2002 Anthony Awards at which he won the &quot;Best Non-fiction/Critical Work&quot; award for his memoir &quot;Seldom Disappointed&quot;.

Two of the Navajo Police novels won The Spur award, given by the Western Writers of America annually. &quot;Skinwalkers&quot; won the award in 1987 for Western Novel, and &quot;The Shape Shifter&quot; won in 2007 for Best Western Short Novel.

&quot;Seldom Disappointed: A Memoir&quot; won the Agatha Award in 2001.

Hillerman&#x27;s novels were recognized at the Macavity Awards. &quot;A Thief of Time&quot; won the &quot;Best Novel&quot; award in 1989, and &quot;Talking Mysteries&quot; won the &quot;Best Critical/Biographical&quot; award in 1992. &quot;Seldom Disappointed&quot; also received a nomination in the &quot;Best Biographical/Critical Mystery Work&quot; category in 2002.

He received the Parris Award in 1995 by Southwest Writer&#x27;s Workshop for his outstanding service to other writers. In 2002, Hillerman received the Agatha Malice Domestic Award for Lifetime Achievement, given by Malice Domestic for mystery novels in the spirit of Agatha Christie.

===Continuation of Leaphorn and Chee series===
In 2013, Hillerman&#x27;s daughter Anne Hillerman published &quot;Spider Woman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (), the first new novel since 2006 featuring Hillerman&#x27;s Navajo Police characters; the novel&#x27;s protagonist is Jim Chee&#x27;s wife, Officer Bernadette Manuelito. Leaphorn&#x27;s involvement is curtailed in the first chapter of the book. Leaphorn is the victim of an assassination attempt, spends half of the book in a coma, and later was severely limited in his ability to communicate. Chee and Bernadette Manuelito are the crime solvers from that book forward in the series, with Leaphorn never fully active in the investigations (though he regains his faculties over time and consults often).

<text>Sather Gate is a prominent landmark separating Sproul Plaza from the bridge over Strawberry Creek, leading to the center of the University of California, Berkeley campus. The gate was donated by Jane K. Sather, a benefactor of the university, in memory of her late husband Peder Sather, a trustee of the College of California, which later became the University of California. It is California Historical Landmark No. 946 and No. 82004649 in the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==
Designed by John Galen Howard and built by Giovanni &quot;John&quot; Meneghetti in the Classical Revival Beaux-Arts style, Sather Gate was completed in 1910. Atop the gate are eight panels of bas-relief figures: four nude men representing the disciplines of law, letters, medicine, and mining, and four nude women representing the disciplines of agriculture, architecture, art, and electricity. They were sculpted by Professor Earl Cummings. From 1910 to 1977, the panels were removed due to differences with Jane Sather. By 1979 they were all reinstalled.

Originally, the gate served as the formal southern entrance to the university campus. The university later expanded further south of Strawberry Creek, and the gate is now well separated from Berkeley&#x27;s city streets by Sproul Plaza.

Between October 2008 and April 2009, Sather Gate underwent restoration that focused on its bronze and steel metal work, which had deteriorated over time. It remained open to pedestrian and vehicular traffic during the period of restoration. Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc., coordinated the restoration, which received a 2010 Design Award from the California Preservation Foundation.

=== Free Speech Movement ===
Sather Gate is part of the historic Sproul Plaza, a major center for student activity and the scene of many protests during the Free Speech Movement. The gate is a notable subject of one of the most recognizable and iconic photographs of the Movement, a fall 1964 shot of students walking through it, carrying the Free Speech banner.

<doc id="294532" wikidata="Q3914496" url="?curid=294532" title="Greenville–Spartanburg International Airport">
<text>Greenville–Spartanburg International Airport () – also known as Roger Milliken Field – is near Greer, South Carolina, United States, midway between Greenville and Spartanburg, the major cities of the Upstate region of South Carolina. The airport is the third-busiest airport in South Carolina, after Charleston International Airport, and Myrtle Beach International Airport with over 2.56 million passengers in 2023.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.

==History==
Before construction of the Greenville–Spartanburg International Airport (GSP), each city had its own airport and competed for airline service. In the mid-1950s Roger Milliken, a textile heir, industrialist, businessman (CEO of Milliken &amp; Company), worked with other Upstate business leaders to get a shared airport for the two cities. In 1958 a proposal for an airport between the two cities was presented to the legislative delegation for the two counties, which approved the construction and the creation of an airport commission, headed by Milliken.

GSP opened on October 15, 1962, replacing Greenville Downtown Airport as the primary airline destination in the region. Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, and Southern Airways had all been serving both Greenville and Spartanburg separately however only Eastern and Southern moved to the new GSP airport while Delta discontinued their service.
In the 1980s, GSP expanded its terminal and cargo facilities, and the runway was lengthened twice in the 1990s. In 2004, the airfield was named for Milliken.

Having been served by legacy carriers, with large hubs in nearby Atlanta and Charlotte, GSP had long been plagued with high fares. The arrival of low-cost carriers in recent years has reduced fares and increased passenger figures. Allegiant Air began flights to Florida in 2006, and in 2011 Southwest Airlines began service to five cities.

Local officials attribute Southwest&#x27;s presence to an unprecedented 38% growth in passenger figures between 2010 and 2011. In 2011 GSP received an ANNIE Award from &quot;Airline and Airport News &amp; Analysis&quot; for being the fastest-growing small airport in the United States. In 2012 the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s Bureau of Travel Statistics reported that average fares from GSP decreased by 14%; the largest decrease in the country.

==Facilities==
The airport covers and has one runway, 4/22, asphalt/concrete.

The airport is mostly in Spartanburg County with a portion in Greenville County. It is in an unincorporated area, adjacent to sections of Greer.

The airport has one terminal building with two concourses: Concourse A (gates A1–A9), and Concourse B (gates B1–B4). The check-in level is the same for all passengers. In 2012 the airport embarked on a four-year, $102 million terminal improvement program which would modernize the terminal and improve passenger flow, as well as prepare for future expansion. Future planning includes several options, i.e., the expansion of the terminal by 300% of its current capacity and the possibility of the addition of second runway, parallel to the existing one.

Concourse A is used by American, Southwest, Silver Airways, Avelo Airlines and United. Allegiant Air and Delta use Concourse B.

The airport can handle up to 250 passengers per hour through immigration and customs checkpoints.

FedEx has a major package facility on the north end of the airport, and BMW has a facility which supports easy transfer of arriving parts to the company&#x27;s manufacturing facility, three miles to the east.

In July 2016, GSP airport and Senator International of Germany announced that a regularly scheduled twice-weekly cargo service would start in November 2016 between GSP airport and Munich, Germany. The cargo service would be the first scheduled international route for the airport. Senator International started the international cargo service to Germany in November 2016, operated by Air Atlanta Icelandic with a Boeing 747-400F aircraft, to both Munich and Frankfurt–Hahn Airport.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

GSP is serviced by seven passenger airlines and their regional affiliates. All service is domestic.

<doc id="294533" wikidata="Q401402" url="?curid=294533" title="Nephritis">
<text>Nephritis is inflammation of the kidneys and may involve the glomeruli, tubules, or interstitial tissue surrounding the glomeruli and tubules. It is one of several different types of nephropathy.

==Types==
* Glomerulonephritis is inflammation of the glomeruli. Glomerulonephritis is often implied when using the term &quot;nephritis&quot; without qualification.
* Interstitial nephritis (or tubulo-interstitial nephritis) is inflammation of the spaces between renal tubules.

==Causes==
Nephritis can often be caused by infections and toxins, but it is most commonly caused by autoimmune disorders that affect the major organs like kidneys.
* Pyelonephritis is inflammation that results from a urinary tract infection that reaches the renal pelvis of the kidney.
* Lupus nephritis is inflammation of the kidney caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease of the immune system.
* Athletic nephritis is nephritis resulting from strenuous exercise. Bloody urine after strenuous exercise may also result from march hemoglobinuria, which is caused by trauma to red blood cells, causing their rupture, which leads to the release of hemoglobin into the urine.

==Mechanism==

Nephritis can produce glomerular injury, by disturbing the glomerular structure with inflammatory cell proliferation. This can lead to reduced glomerular blood flow, leading to reduced urine output (oliguria) and retention of waste products (uremia). As a result, red blood cells may leak out of damaged glomeruli, causing blood to appear in the urine (hematuria).

Low renal blood flow activates the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), causing fluid retention and mild hypertension. As the kidneys inflame, they begin to excrete needed protein from the affected individual&#x27;s body into the urine stream. This condition is called proteinuria.

Loss of necessary protein due to nephritis can result in several life-threatening symptoms. The most serious complication of nephritis can occur if there is significant loss of the proteins that keep blood from clotting excessively. Loss of these proteins can result in blood clots, causing sudden stroke.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis depends on the cause of the nephritis, and in the case of lupus nephritis, blood tests, X-rays and an ultrasound can help ascertain if the individual has the condition.

==Treatment==

Treatment (or management) of nephritis depends on what has provoked the inflammation of the kidney(s). In the case of lupus nephritis, hydroxychloroquine could be used.

===Prevalence===
Nephritis represents the ninth-most-common cause of death among all women in the US (and the fifth leading cause among non-Hispanic black women).

Worldwide, the highest rates of nephritis are 50–55% for African or Asian descent followed by Hispanic at 43% and Caucasian at 17%.

The average age of an individual diagnosed with kidney inflammation (in this case, lupus nephritis) is 28.4 years old.

<doc id="294534" wikidata="Q847772" url="?curid=294534" title="Piedmont Triad International Airport">
<text>Piedmont Triad International Airport (; commonly referred to locally as &quot;PTI&quot;) is an airport located in unincorporated Guilford County, North Carolina, west of Greensboro, serving the Piedmont Triad region of Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem as well as the entire Piedmont Triad region in North Carolina, United States. The airport, located just off Bryan Boulevard, sits on a 3,770 acre (1,526 ha) campus and has three runways. It is the third busiest airport in North Carolina in terms of airplane movements, averaging 280 takeoffs and landings each day. As of 2025, GSO ranks 103rd in passenger arrivals and departures in the US, offering passenger service to 14 U.S. destinations. PTI is owned and operated by the Piedmont Triad Airport Authority.

This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings (enplanements) per year.

A proposal to rename the airport to &quot;Central North Carolina International Airport&quot; passed in December 2017; the renaming was slated to become effective on January 1, 2018. Due to public objections, however, the name change is on hold.

==History==
Maynard Field, a predecessor of PTI Airport and one of the first commercial airports in the South, was dedicated on December 6, 1919, just west of Greensboro near Oak Ridge. With its two intersecting runways measuring and , hangar space, and even an early day equivalent of a Fixed-Base Operator that made sure the torches were lit at dusk, Maynard Field was named to honor a young North Carolinian pilot named Lt. Belvin Maynard. By 1922 it had competition to the west with Miller Field in Winston-Salem, and Charles Field, a single airstrip that was used mainly for barnstorming, and for take-off drills and landings for the Charles family.

Piedmont Triad International Airport had its start in 1927 when the Tri-City Airport Commission selected near the community of Friendship for an airport, and petitioned to become a stop along the congressionally authorized airmail route from New York to New Orleans. Racing pilot Captain Roscoe Turner referred to the current location of Piedmont Triad International Airport as &quot;the best landing field in the south&quot;. Friendship, near Greensboro, was selected over neighboring Winston-Salem, which subsequently refused to contribute funds for airport construction and nullified the Tri-City Airport Authority collaborative effort.

Greensboro and Guilford County jointly purchased the Friendship property from Paul C. and Helen G. Lindley, and named it Lindley Field in May 1927 with 12,000 people in attendance. The field then had no runways, no lights, no hangar, and no passenger station. Charles Lindbergh stopped at Lindley Field with the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; on his cross-country tour celebrating the advances of aviation on October 14, 1927. Regular mail service started in 1928.

Pitcairn Aviation, Incorporated, was given the contract to fly the airmail route, the second official airmail route in the United States, and made the first delivery of airmail in North Carolina on May 1, 1928. Sid Malloy, the pilot of the aircraft, landed with two bags of mail and took three bags of mail to be sent to Atlanta. After a brief closure during the Great Depression, the airport reopened on May 17, 1937, with two all-weather runways. In time, Pitcairn Aviation built a hangar; Greensboro built a passenger station; the United States government established a weather bureau; and the Department of Commerce set up a radio tower. Passenger service was inaugurated by Dixie Flying Service on November 6, 1930, with a route to Washington, D.C. Pitcairn Aviation took over the route under its new name Eastern Air Transport, which later became Eastern Air Lines.

In July 1942, responsibility for the airport was given to the Greensboro-High Point Airport Authority, with representatives from Greensboro, High Point, and Guilford County. Shortly thereafter the Army Air Corps requisitioned the airport and its facilities for war use and airmail and passenger service was discontinued. The corps lengthened the runways and built a new passenger terminal. Civilian service resumed after the war, though growth was moderate due to the success of nearby Smith Reynolds Airport in Winston-Salem.

A new passenger terminal opened in 1958, replacing the temporary facility that had served since World War II. The terminal was a modern glass paneled structure with a single pier. PTI was then served by Eastern, Piedmont, and Capital (which merged with United in 1961). The April 1957 Official Airline Guide showed departures each weekday by Eastern (17), Piedmont (9), and Capital (7).

During the 1970s the airport was renamed Greensboro–High Point Airport and then later Greensboro–High Point–Winston-Salem Regional Airport. Work on a new facility began in 1978 and the airport gained a greater prominence on the East Coast, offering passenger service from Delta Air Lines, Piedmont Airlines, United Airlines and Eastern Air Lines. Cargo carriers, including the postal service, textile manufacturers, and Federal Express–a new overnight letter and package delivery service–were shipping tons of freight each year. By 1975, airport officials began to plan for a new terminal. Piedmont Airlines announced its intention to consolidate its operations at Greensboro, but in the months that followed, opened a hub in Charlotte instead.

The new terminal complex was completed in 1982, designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills and AHM Architects. The following year, the Marriott opened a $16 million, 300-room hotel on the airport property. The facility was renamed Piedmont Triad International Airport in 1987.

TIMCO Aviation Services (now Haeco Americas) opened its world headquarters at PTI in 1990, and grew into one of the world&#x27;s largest independent aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul providers. In 1993, Continental Lite, established a hub at PTI, but by 1995 the hub lost its parent company, Continental Airlines $140 million and Continental ceased hub operations at PTI. In 1998 FedEx Corporation announced its intentions to build a mid-Atlantic hub at PTI, one of only five FedEx hubs in the country. In addition to the hub, the project included the construction of a parallel, 9,000-foot runway.

Delta Connection carrier Comair built a maintenance hangar at PTI to perform work on their CRJ&#x27;s in 2005. The airport also opened an expansion to the North Concourse, which added another 40,000 square feet to the terminal and brought the number of gates to 25. It also opened a 43,000 square-foot expansion to the main terminal to accommodate security gates at the north and south concourse.

FedEx opened its mid-Atlantic Hub at the Airport in 2003, and in 2006, Honda Aircraft Company selected PTI as its global headquarters. Allegiant Air began service to Orlando Sanford International Airport and St. Petersburg–Clearwater International Airport in late May 2007.

The airport completed a new 9,000-foot parallel runway in 2010. In 2011 PTI began a renovation project that included new furnishings, automated baggage handling, free wireless internet, charging stations for passenger devices, and interactive kiosks to guide passengers to ground transportation, lodging, and restaurants.

In July 2017 American Eagle announced non-stop service to Chicago–O&#x27;Hare International Airport. In September 2018 Spirit Airlines announced service to Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, and Tampa.

==Terminals and facilities==
Completed in 1982, the terminal building of Piedmont Triad International Airport currently has 26 passenger gates: 14 on the north concourse, and 12 on the south concourse. A 2006 expansion added another to the terminal (at a cost of $5 million); a substantial part of this space was used to establish more permanent security checkpoints. Both concourses are the same size, despite the different gate numbers. There are two passenger accessible levels of the terminal. The top includes ticketing, security, boarding, and concession areas. The bottom floor houses baggage claim and ground transportation.

Previously a US Airways Club, American Airlines operated an Admirals Club across from Gate 45 in the south concourse. As of October 15, 2018, the Admirals Club permanently closed.

As of March 30, 2019, the airport averages 246 aircraft operations per day: 37% general aviation, 33% air taxi, 28% scheduled commercial, and 2% military. There are currently 86 aircraft based at this airport: 67 single-engine, 11 multi-engine, and 8 jet.

Among notable planes based at the airport is the DC-8 operated by the international disaster relief organization Samaritan&#x27;s Purse, one of the last remaining in service; the airport is the home of the organization&#x27;s main maintenance facility and also houses a Boeing 757.

21 Air and iAero Airways are both headquartered in Greensboro. 21 Air operates daily scheduled cargo services (as DHL Aviation) and iAero Airways maintains a maintenance base on the south side of the airfield.

==Future developments==
A significant investment is being made into the interstate highway network adjacent to the airport, which will result in easy access from industrial sites around the airport on interstate highways leading north, south, east and west. Major highways such as I-40, I-85 and I-74 are already in place, with connectors under construction and coming on line in the near future.

There are currently nine available sites on the airport campus ready for future development.

As part of the I-73 construction, a taxiway was built to allow approximately 400 acres of property north of Future I-73 to access the airport.

Construction of a new air traffic control tower began in April 2019 and is projected to be commissioned in 2022. This will feature a 180 foot tall tower with a 550 square foot cab for controllers. The base will be 15,650 square feet, and will house the new TRACON facility.

Boom Supersonic has also built a 65-acre Superfactory, where they plan to manufacture their supersonic flagship airplane, the Overture, which will begin commercial operations in 2030, with groundbreaking starting in late 2022 and construction completing in June 2024. The site will create 1,750 jobs, and 200 internships for the area. The project is projected to grow the state&#x27;s economy by at least $32.8 billion over the next 20 years. The site will be the final assembly and manufacturing area for the airplane.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On February 4, 1962, a USAF Douglas C-47 climbed to 150–200 feet after takeoff and fell to the left, cartwheeled and burned. All seven on board died.
* On August 2, 1989, Piedmont Airlines Flight 1489, a Boeing 737-400, en route to Charlotte/Douglas International Airport was diverted to Piedmont Triad International Airport on report of landing gear malfunction. Reports indicated a wheel chock was left in the wheel well the night before causing a failure to extend. The plane landed with one gear up.
* September 26, 1989, Wrangler Aviation (later Tradewinds Airlines and Sky Lease Cargo), a Canadair CL-44, en route to Greensboro from Rafael Hernández Airport (in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico), came within 30 feet of the airport terminal after the first officer failed to follow procedure for a missed approach.
* December 22, 1996, Airborne Express Flight 827, a Douglas DC-8-63F, departed Greensboro for a test flight and was intended to return to Greensboro. However, while performing a stall test, the crew accidentally caused the aircraft to enter a real stall and used an incorrect recovery technique. The aircraft crashed in Narrows, Virginia. All six people on board were killed.
* August 8, 2000, Airtran Airways Flight 913, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 departing from Greensboro reported smoke in the flight deck. The smoke became very dense and restricted the crew&#x27;s ability to see both the cockpit instruments and the visual references outside the airplane. The cabin crew noticed a smell of smoke, followed by a visual sighting of smoke and sparks in the area of the forward flight attendant jumpseat. The flight crew was able to identify the Greensboro airport and make a successful emergency landing. The airplane was immediately stopped, and an emergency evacuation was conducted on a taxiway.
* May 8, 2008, N904FX and N905FX, two ATR-42-320s were written off after they suffered substantial damage at Piedmont Triad International Airport when the airport was hit by an EF2 tornado. Both aircraft were parked when they were struck by the tornado; one was blown into a ditch and the other was blown into a fence.

<text>The spider family Liphistiidae was first recognized by Tamerlan Thorell in 1869. When narrowly circumscribed, it comprises a single genus &quot;Liphistius&quot;, native to Southeast Asia; , this was the circumscription accepted by the World Spider Catalog. The family contains the most basal living spiders, belonging to the suborder Mesothelae. The family has also been circumscribed more broadly to include the family Heptathelidae as a subfamily, Heptathelinae, with the narrowly circumscribed Liphistiidae becoming the subfamily Liphistiinae.

==Taxonomy==
The family Liphistiidae was erected by Tamerlan Thorell in 1869 for the genus &quot;Liphistius&quot;. Initially, it was the only family placed in the suborder Mesothelae. In 1923, Kyukichi Kishida described a new genus, &quot;Heptathela&quot;, and suggested creating two tribes within the Liphistiidae corresponding to the genera &quot;Liphistius&quot; and &quot;Heptathela&quot;. In 1939, Alexander Petrunkevitch raised the tribe Heptatheleae to a separate family, Heptathelidae, thus restoring the narrower circumscription of the Liphistiidae. In 1985, Robert Raven reunited the two families, a view supported by Breitling in 2022. Other authors have maintained two separate families, a position accepted by the World Spider Catalog .

&quot;Liphistius&quot;, the sole genus in the narrowly circumscribed family Liphistiidae, is found mainly in Southeast Asia (Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Sumatra), with a few species found in China. The Heptathelidae are found further north: five genera in northern Vietnam and China and two genera in Japan and offshore islands (Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands).

===Phylogeny===
Molecular phylogenetic studies have repeatedly shown that the suborder Mesothelae is monophyletic, at least as regards extant (living) species, with the two families forming separate clades:
===Genera===
, the World Spider Catalog accepted the narrow circumscription of the family &quot;Liphistiidae&quot;, in which it contains only one genus:
*&quot;Liphistius&quot; — Asia

==Description==
Members of the Liphistiidae share features with the other Mesothelae family, Heptathelidae. They are medium to large spiders. They have downward pointing, daggerlike chelicerae. Like other members of the suborder Mesothelae, and unlike all other extant spiders, they have a segmented series of plates (tergites) on the upper surface of all segments of the abdomen and their spinnerets are placed in the middle of the underside of the abdomen, rather than at the end. Their sternum (a plate on the underside of the cephalothorax) is narrow, and there is another smaller ventral plate (the sternite) between the fourth pair of legs. The carapace is mostly flat, though it can be slightly elevated near the head. The eyes are distinctly clustered together on a single nodule. The anterior median eyes are small, but the posterior median eyes are large and round. The lateral eyes are long and kidney-shaped. The distal leg segments have strong spines and three claws. The respiratory system consists only of book lungs, which could help explain why they are relatively inactive. Unlike heptathelids, the male palp has a tibial apophysis.

In the past, they were frequently believed to lack venom, but in 2010 it was shown that at least some &quot;Liphistius&quot; species have venom glands.

Liphistiids are tube-dwelling spiders that construct rudimentary trap-doors. They spend most of their time in their tubes and are rarely seen above ground. They are active at night and live for many years. Unlike members of the family Heptathelidae, Liphistiidae spiders construct signal lines radiating from the entrance to their burrows. Adult males sometimes wander in search for females, but females rarely leave their burrows.

==Fossil record==
While some Carboniferous fossil spiders have been assigned to Mesothelae, the only fossil to be explicitly placed in the family Liphistiidae is &quot;Cretaceothele lata&quot; from the Cretaceous Burmese amber of Myanmar. The fossil genus was diagnosed as having an eye-field wider than that in living species. It was later placed in its own, monotypic family Cretaceothelidae.

It is located in Romulus, a Detroit suburb. It is by far Michigan&#x27;s busiest airport, with ten times as many enplanements and deplanements as the next-busiest, Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids and more than all other airports in the state combined.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a large hub primary commercial service facility. The airport covers of land. 

The airport is a major hub for Delta Air Lines and is also a base for Spirit Airlines.The airport has service to 30 international destinations and service to 39 states across the United States. Operated by the Wayne County Airport Authority, the airport has six runways, two terminals, and 129 in-service gates. Detroit Metropolitan Airport has maintenance facilities capable of servicing and repairing aircraft as large as the Boeing 747-400.

Metro Airport serves the Metropolitan Detroit area; the Toledo, Ohio, area about south; the Ann Arbor area to the west; Windsor, Ontario; and Southwestern Ontario in Canada. The airport serves over 140 destinations and was named the best large U.S. airport in customer satisfaction by J.D. Power &amp; Associates in 2010, 2019, and 2022.

==History==
Wayne County began to plan an airport in the western townships of the county as early as 1927. The following year, the county board of commissioners issued a $2 million bond to fund the purchase of of land at the corner of Middlebelt and Wick roads, the northeastern boundary of today&#x27;s airport. Construction was completed in 1929, and the first landing was on February 22, 1930; Wayne County Airport was dedicated on September 4, 1930. That year, Thompson Aeronautical Corporation, a forerunner of American Airlines, began service from the airport. From 1931 until 1945, the airport hosted Michigan Air National Guard operations gained by the United States Army Air Forces. It was named Romulus Field during the war; it was then all east of Merriman Road and north of Goddard Road. The intersection of the two runways is still visible at .

Wayne County expanded the airport to become Detroit&#x27;s primary airport. It renamed it Detroit-Wayne Major Airport in 1947, and in the next three years expanded threefold as three more runways were built. In 1949 the airport added runways 3L/21R and 9L/27R, followed by runway 4R/22L in 1950. In 1946-47 most airline traffic moved from the cramped Detroit City Airport (now Coleman A. Young International Airport) northeast of downtown Detroit to Willow Run Airport over west of the city, and west of Wayne County Airport.

Pan-Am (1954) and BOAC (1956) were the first passenger airlines at Detroit-Wayne Major. In the April 1957 Official Airline Guide they were the only passenger airlines: three Pan Am DC-7Cs each week FRA–LHR–SNN–DTW–ORD and back, and one BOAC DC-7C each week LHR–PIK–YUL–DTW–ORD and back (skipping YUL on the return flight).

Aerial photographs of DTW from 1949 and 1956 show the airport&#x27;s expansion. In 1958 the Civil Aviation Administration—now the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)—announced the inclusion of Detroit-Wayne in the first group of American airports to receive new long-range radar equipment, enabling the airport to become the first inland airport in the United States certified for jet airliners. Also, in 1958, airport management completed the Leroy C. Smith (South) Terminal and gave the airport its present name.

American Airlines moved from Willow Run to Detroit-Wayne in October 1958, followed by Northwest, Allegheny, and Delta in the next few months; the other airlines stayed at Willow Run until 1966.

Northwest&#x27;s flights to Minneapolis were DTW&#x27;s only nonstops west beyond Chicago and Milwaukee until 1966. The first scheduled jets were Delta DC-8s to Miami in late 1959. The North Terminal (later renamed the James M. Davey Terminal) opened in 1966, which was located on the current site of the Evans Terminal. A third terminal, the Michael Berry International Terminal, opened in 1974. The last of its original three parallel runways (3R/21L) was completed in 1976; a new parallel crosswind runway (9R/27L) opened in 1993.

Republic Airlines began hub operations in 1984, and its merger with Northwest Airlines in 1986 expanded the hub. The Northwest hub operated out of the Davey Terminal throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Transpacific flights began in 1987, with Northwest providing nonstop service to Tokyo–Narita. The last of Metro&#x27;s six runways (4L/22R) was completed in December 2001 in preparation for the opening of the mile-long, 122-gate, $1.2 billion McNamara Terminal in the airport midfield in 2002. The airport remained a hub for Northwest Airlines until it merged with Delta Air Lines.

The present Runway 3L/21R has had four identifiers. When it opened in 1949, it was Runway 3/21. With the opening of the new west side Runway 3L/21R in 1950, the original 3/21 became 3R/21L. With the opening of the new east side Runway 3R/21L in 1976, it became 3C/21C. With the opening of Runway 4L/22R in December 2001 and the splitting of the field into two sectors (3/21 on the east and 4/22 on the west), Runway 3C/21C became Runway 3L/21R.

In 2009, Detroit Metro Airport launched its first social media efforts with participation in Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube networks.

Detroit was a major hub for Northwest Airlines from 1986 to 2010; Northwest merged with Delta Air Lines, and Detroit became Delta&#x27;s second-largest hub.

In April 2011 Lufthansa launched a unique curbside check-in and baggage check service for premium customers from DTW&#x27;s North Terminal to Frankfurt and beyond. Lufthansa became the only airline allowing international customers departing from DTW to check their bags and receive a boarding pass at the curb, while DTW became Lufthansa&#x27;s first North American gateway with this service.

Detroit&#x27;s economy plunged in the Great Recession, causing airlines such as British Airways to drop flights to London–Heathrow and other airlines such as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Virgin Atlantic to use codeshare flights through Delta Air Lines. The city has lost population, but Detroit Metropolitan Airport has since re-grown, and airlines are looking to expand or resume service. JetBlue Airways began flights to Boston in February 2014. Spirit Airlines has grown at DTW, adding service to more East and West Coast cities. Spirit has increased its market share to over 10%, widening the gap as Metro Airport&#x27;s second largest carrier.

Royal Jordanian was the first airline to schedule the Boeing 787 Dreamliner into Detroit, on December 1, 2014.

One of Delta Connection carriers, Compass Airlines chose to close its operating base in Detroit to move operations to the new Seattle hub in early 2015. Delta has replaced many of the existing Compass flights with mainline Delta flights to allow SkyWest Airlines and GoJet to open Detroit bases.

Beginning in January 2018 Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation, or SMART Bus, began providing a direct connection from the airport to the Rosa Parks Transit Center in downtown Detroit via route 261, also known as the Michigan Ave FAST bus, with stations at both the McNamara and Evans terminals.

On June 26, 2015, Spirit Airlines announced the construction of a new maintenance facility, saying it would bring $31.5 million and 82 jobs to the area. Spirit previously had a hangar that closed, forcing the airline to do maintenance at the gate with contract workers. With the new facility, which opened in May 2017, Spirit will retain its operating base at Metro Airport and bring more flights. Spirit was also the first airline to regularly fly the A320neo in the US, the first route was Detroit to Los Angeles as well as add self-tagging luggage kiosks at DTW.

In 2017, WOW Air announced service to Reykjavík on the Airbus A321. This marked the first ever entrance of a modern European low-cost carrier to DTW. In the summer of 2018, Reykjavík went from the 55th most traveled destination to the fifth due to this flight&#x27;s popularity. Passengers could connect onwards in Reykjavík, boosting travel to European destinations. In March 2019, the airline ceased operations, leaving Metro Airport with no low-cost nonstop to Europe; the airport looked for replacement service to begin in 2020, but due to the COVID pandemic, that effort ceased until 2022, when Icelandair and Delta announced seasonal flights to Reykjavík starting in 2023.

Since the Great Recession of 2008, Southeast Michigan has gone through an economic and industrial resurgence leading to several new airlines and services including service by Icelandair, Sun Country, Turkish, and WestJet. In October 2021, Turkish Airlines announced the intent to serve Detroit. Service began on November 13, 2023. In February 2023, WestJet announced seasonal service to Calgary, later adding seasonal service to Vancouver.


==Facilities==
DTW has 2 passenger terminals and 4 concourses with a total of 147 gates.

===Edward H. McNamara Terminal===


The McNamara Terminal, also once known as the Northwest WorldGateway, opened February 24, 2002. Designed by SmithGroup and built by Hunt Construction Group, it replaced the aged Davey Terminal. During development, the terminal was known as the Midfield Terminal. The terminal is used exclusively by Delta (which merged with Northwest) and Delta partners Aeromexico, Air France, and WestJet. This terminal has three concourses, A, B, and C, which house 121 gates with shopping and dining in the center of A concourse (known as the Central Link), as well as throughout the concourses. It houses five Delta Sky Clubs located throughout Concourse A, and 1 located in Concourses B and C. At nearly in length, Concourse A in McNamara Terminal is the second-longest airport concourse in the world (the longest is in Terminal 1 of Kansai International Airport in Japan). In addition to moving walkways spaced along the length of each concourse, Concourse A has a people mover, the ExpressTram. It transports passengers between each end of Concourse A in just over three minutes. Trams arrive almost simultaneously at the &quot;Terminal Station&quot;, in the midpoint of the concourse and depart in opposite directions to the &quot;North Station&quot; and the &quot;South Station&quot;, then return. The McNamara Terminal opened a new baggage sorting facility in October 2008, which has improved the screening of baggage through 14 new explosive detection system devices along a fully automated conveyor system. Northwest Airlines said that it reduced the amount of lost baggage, and it improved the timeliness of bags getting to their correct flight.

An AAA Four Star Westin hotel is connected to the A concourse. Additionally, overnight guests at the hotel who are not flying can obtain a pass to enter the concourses to visit shops and restaurants. Called the &quot;Airport Access Authorization to Commercial Establishments Beyond the Screen Checkpoint&quot; (AAACE), registered guests must be cleared through the same security background check (Secure Flight) and TSA screening process as travelers to access the terminal area. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is the only other airport participating in this program.

The A concourse houses 78 gates with 12 gates used for international departures and arrivals processing. The A concourse is intended for all aircraft. At the midpoint of the concourse is a large, laminar flow water feature designed by WET. The concourse contains over of moving walkways. The A concourse also includes a pet relief area for passengers traveling with pets and service animals. Signage through the terminal is in English, along with Japanese, due to a large number of business travelers from Japan. Izumi Suzuki, a Sheraton employee, and several colleagues provided the Japanese translations used by the airport. In previous eras many Japanese travelers going through Detroit missed connections due to a lack of English comprehension. Also, messages reminding travelers to configure watches to the Eastern Time Zone regularly broadcast through the public address system are said in English, Japanese, and Mandarin.

In addition to the ticketing level, there&#x27;s an additional ticketing and security area for passengers using the parking structures.

The terminal houses ten international gates that are capable of dual jet bridge loading and unloading. The gates contain two exit configurations depending on the arriving flight. Domestic arrivals follow an upper path directly into the terminal, while international arrivals proceed downstairs to customs and immigration screening. The Customs and Border Protection processing center located in the terminal&#x27;s lower level is designed to accommodate as many as 3,200 passengers per hour. International arriving passengers connecting to another flight are screened by TSA at a dedicated screening checkpoint within the international arrivals facility. Those passengers then exit directly back into the center of the A concourse. Passengers arriving from international destinations who end their trip in Detroit (or connecting to a flight via Evans Terminal) exit directly into a dedicated International Arrivals Hall on the lower level of the terminal.

The B and C concourses currently have 41 gates that are used for Delta&#x27;s regional flights that employ smaller aircraft. All regional flights have jet bridges, eliminating the need for outdoor boarding.

The B and C concourses are connected to the main terminal building and the A concourse by a pedestrian walkway under the airport ramp. This walkway, known as the &quot;Light Tunnel&quot;, features an elaborate multi-colored light show behind sculpted glass panels extending the entire length of the walkway, as well as several moving walkways. The light patterns are synchronized with an original musical score composed by Victor Alexeeff, which runs for nearly 30 minutes before repeating. This installation, one of the first large-scale uses of color-changing LED lighting in the United States, was produced by Mills James Productions with glasswork by Foxfire Glass Works of Pontiac, Michigan. The display won multiple lighting design awards, including the prestigious Guth Award of Merit. For passengers prone to medical conditions such as seizures, buttons at each end of the tunnel will suspend the light show for five minutes so they can pass through with no adverse effects.

The terminal has undergone updates that include new electronic terminal directories to assist passengers better. A unique feature of this is that passengers can scan their boarding passes, and the screen will direct them to the gate from which their plane departs. The passenger can also choose to view the information in other languages. Passengers may select a restaurant on the touch screen, and a menu will show what items the restaurant serves. Mini tablet devices and phone/tablet apps have been installed in food court areas, where travelers may order food and have it delivered to their table.

There are five Delta Sky Clubs located in the McNamara terminal. The largest is located above the central link across from gate A38. Next to that, across from gate A43, houses a smaller Sky Club. There are two satellite Sky Clubs in Concourse A located on the upper level near gates A18 and A68, across from their respective ExpressTram stations. An additional Sky Club is located in Concourse C, at gate level near the entrance to Concourse C. This lounge services Delta Connection flights in concourses B &amp; C.

===Warren Cleage Evans Terminal===
The Evans Terminal, formerly known as the North Terminal, was designed by Gensler and built by Walbridge/Barton Malow Joint Venture, opened September 17, 2008, as the replacement for the aged Berry and Smith terminals, which housed all non-SkyTeam airlines. It used to be known as the North Terminal until it was renamed in 2022. Initially, Wayne County Airport Authority sought bids for the naming rights of the North Terminal. After two years with no successful offers, however, the effort ceased and the &quot;North Terminal&quot; name remained. 
The terminal currently houses all non-SkyTeam airlines serving the airport and is considered D Concourse. (Concourses A, B, and C are housed in the McNamara Terminal) The concourse has 29 gates, two of which opened in the middle of 2009 to accommodate international wide-body aircraft, and three of which were added to the north end of the concourse in 2022. The two gates were unusable at the building&#x27;s opening because they were extremely close to Smith Terminal&#x27;s C concourse, which was demolished after operations moved to the new facility. The terminal features four long segments of moving walkways on the departures level and another moving walkway on the lower level, for international arriving passengers to access the Federal Inspection Services area.

Airlines that utilize the North Terminal include Air Canada, Alaska, American, American Eagle, Frontier, Icelandair, JetBlue, Lufthansa, Royal Jordanian, Southwest, Spirit, Sun Country, Turkish, United, United Express, and all non-SkyTeam and non-Delta partner charters.

The Evans Terminal houses two six-lane security checkpoints. The terminal also has U.S. Customs &amp; Border Protection inspection facilities located on the lower level for arriving international flights.

This terminal includes a brand new service pet relief area to accommodate passengers traveling with pets.

The Evans Terminal has five common-use domestic baggage carousels on the lower level. Two additional carousels are located inside the Federal Inspection Services area for international flights, and a central Oversize Baggage Claim is adjacent to both the international and domestic carousel areas.

On January 29, 2010, the Evans Terminal was named winner of the &quot;Build Michigan&quot; award project.

The Evans Terminal is home to a Lufthansa Business and Senator Lounge located between Gates D7 and D8. This lounge is accessible to passengers flying in Lufthansa premium cabins as well as select Lufthansa and Star Alliance elite members. This lounge also grants access to Priority Pass members outside of peak hours.

===Historical terminals===
====Michael Berry Terminal====

The Berry Terminal, named for a former airport commissioner, was designed by Detroit architect Louis G. Redstone, and opened in 1974 as the international terminal at DTW. It was decommissioned on September 17, 2008, and replaced by the Evans Terminal; however, the airport authority voted May 20, 2009, to renovate the terminal to house its offices. All international passengers would arrive at this terminal, pass through customs and immigration inspection, and continue on to their connecting flights by bus to adjacent terminals.

Originally containing six gates (two of which were removed in 2003 to allow for construction of an adjacent Northwest Airlines maintenance hangar), the terminal was later used for scheduled and charter flights. There were still several international scheduled flights on low cost carriers to destinations in the Caribbean and other warm-weathered places in the early 2000s (decade), including flights from Champion Air, Ryan International Airlines, and USA3000 Airlines. Four charter airlines also used this terminal.

Since its closure in 2008, the Berry Terminal has become a popular space for commercial film and television production. Films such as Up in the Air (2009), Machine Gun Preacher (2011), and This Must Be the Place have used the now-vacant terminal as a set (in addition to shooting in and around the airport&#x27;s active terminals).

====L. C. Smith Terminal====
The Smith Terminal, named for Detroit-Wayne Major airport visionary Leroy C. Smith, was built in 1958. Though cited as the oldest of Metro Airport&#x27;s terminals, that designation belongs to the &quot;Executive Terminal&quot; building located near Middlebelt Road and Lucas Drive, one-quarter-mile east. The Executive Terminal was built in the late 1920s and is still in operation today as home to ASIG, a flight support company.

The Smith Terminal&#x27;s thirty-two gates originally housed Northwest Orient Airlines, Allegheny Airlines (forerunner to US Airways), Eastern Airlines, and Pan-Am, among others. A control tower was included in the construction, and served its purpose until the late 1980s, when a new control tower was built near the site of the new McNamara Terminal.

In later years, Smith Terminal hosted North American airlines other than Northwest, Continental, and later Delta, which relocated to the McNamara Terminal in 2002 before its merger with Northwest.

State of the art for its time, the Smith Terminal eventually became victim to airline expansion. The design of the building did not allow for physical expansion of the ticketing area. To accommodate additional airlines, ticketing counters were constructed on the sides of the lobby in areas that previously held lounges and retail. In contrast, the North Terminal was constructed with future expansion in mind.

Spirit Airlines, which operated out of many of the gates once used by Northwest, made few upgrades to the gate areas in those parts of the terminal. The Northwest Airlines display boards near check-in counters at each gate remained in place, with the Northwest logos removed, and a Spirit information board simply affixed over the old signage.

On September 10, 2008, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; reported that Smith Terminal itself will not be demolished due to the airport authority offices remaining on the upper floors. However, the Detroit Free Press of October 9, 2008, stated that maintaining the terminal in its present condition would cost upwards of $4 million annually in utilities, a sore spot for airlines at DTW who foot the bill, in part, through airport landing fees; the airlines were hoping for a greater cost savings once the Smith and Berry Terminals were decommissioned. On May 20, 2009, the airport authority formally voted to totally vacate the Smith Terminal, while retaining and renovating the Berry Terminal for its offices.

Discussions were also raised regarding proposed construction of a new structure to house the Airport Authority offices and Airport Police, with a preliminary price tag of $31.5 million.

====James M. Davey Terminal====
The Davey Terminal was built in 1966 and was first known as &quot;Terminal 2&quot; or the &quot;North Terminal&quot;. Designed by the firm of Smith, Hinchman and Grylls, it was said to be the largest post tensioned building in the world. Tapering cruciform columns around the perimeter and curved beams supported five large concrete roof panels. The lack of columns allowed maximum flexibility in the interior space. The spaces between the roof panels and exterior columns were filled with glass to allow abundant natural light into the building. It was renamed the &quot;J. M. Davey Terminal&quot; in 1975 in honor of former airport manager James M. Davey. It originally contained three concourses labeled C to E, as well as a Host Hotel which later was rebranded Marriott. In the early 1980s, a separate ticketing area was constructed to the north of the Davey Terminal, along with Concourses F and G to eventually accommodate Northwest Airlines&#x27; regional jet fleet.

Over time, the terminal and added concourse began showing its age due to its layout and poor maintenance, hastened further by increased aircraft traffic, which it was not designed to handle efficiently. Despite this, more gates were added to Concourse C in a short-term expansion project in the early 1990s, making it 26 gates in length. This concourse was considered the worst by most travelers due to its long distance from the center of the terminal, and for its length.

The Davey Terminal was originally the principal base of operations for Republic Airlines, which merged with Northwest Orient Airlines to become Northwest Airlines in 1986. Upon relocation of Northwest operations to the McNamara Terminal, the Davey Terminal was mothballed for three years before demolition of the ticketing area and Concourse G began October 17, 2005, to prepare for the North Terminal project. All concourses of the Davey Terminal and adjoining Marriott hotel, except gates 1 to 11 of Concourse C, were subsequently demolished in 2005–06 (the remaining gates were in use by Spirit Airlines until the new North Terminal (now Evans Terminal) opened on September 17, 2008).

===Ground transportation===
The airport is accessible from I-94 via Merriman Road (exit 198), which is the nearest entrance to the Evans Terminal, and from I-275 via Eureka Road (exit 15), which is closer to the McNamara Terminal. Both entrances and the terminals are connected by John D. Dingell Drive, an expressway completed in 1999 and named after the longtime Congressman. Cell phone lots are located near both entrances.

Free shuttle buses are available between the two terminals, and also connect to the Green parking lots. Rental car companies provide their own shuttles, as do private offsite parking lots and most hotels in the airport&#x27;s vicinity.

=== Public transit ===

Metro Airport is accessible by public transit, served by the RTA&#x27;s Detroit Air Xpress (DAX), an express bus to downtown Detroit; and SMART&#x27;s FAST Michigan, a limited-stop bus route connecting the airport to Detroit and Dearborn, with connections to the region&#x27;s wider transit network.

Two local bus routes, operated by SMART, also serve the airport: route 125, to communities in the Downriver region of southern Wayne County, serving both terminals; and route 280, to downtown Romulus and other suburbs in western Wayne County, serving only the Evans Terminal.

Transit to Ann Arbor, Brighton, and East Lansing is available with the Michigan Flyer, an intercity bus operated by Indian Trails in partnership with TheRide. Service to destinations in southern Ontario, Canada, including Windsor and London, is offered by Robert Q Airbus, a private operator.

Transit buses board from the Ground Transportation Center at the Evans Terminal, and from the departures drop-off area at McNamara.

==Accidents and incidents==
* December 30, 1963, a Zantop Air Transport C-46 Commando with 4 occupants crashed 2.2 miles SW of DTW, killing all aboard. A loss of control during a night instrument approach in adverse weather was the probable cause.
* June 12, 1972, after a stopover in Detroit, American Airlines Flight 96, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 with 56 passengers and 11 crew from Los Angeles International Airport en route to Buffalo, New York, suffered a cargo door failure and explosive decompression shortly after departure from Detroit Metropolitan Airport while flying over Windsor, Ontario. It is thus sometimes referred to as the Windsor incident. The aircraft sustained damage that left the pilots without full flight controls but the plane returned to Detroit for a successful emergency landing. There were no fatalities but several serious to minor injuries.
* July 31, 1972, Delta Air Lines Flight 841; members of the Black Liberation Army took over the airplane in flight using weapons smuggled on board, including a Bible, cut out to hold a handgun. The plane held seven crew and 94 passengers, none of whom was killed during the hijacking. Five hijackers who had boarded with three children took over the plane. The plane flew to Miami, where the passengers were exchanged for $1 million in ransom. The plane was then flown on to Boston, where it refueled before flying to Algeria. Algeria seized the plane and ransom, which they returned to the U.S., but the hijackers were released after a few days.
* December 15, 1972, a Zantop International Airlines Learjet 23, a ferry flight, crashed after failing to climb from runway 3R, hitting a fuel storage tank. Both occupants on board and one on the ground were killed. Cause undetermined.
* January 19, 1979, a Learjet 25 operated by Massey Ferguson rolled violently and crashed on approach to runway 09. The probable causes were icing, wake vortex by a preceding McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and a delayed application of engine thrust during an attempted go-around. All six occupants (two crew, four passengers) were killed. 
*On April 4, 1979, TWA Flight 841 (1979) went into a dive above Saginaw, Michigan. The flight made an emergency landing at DTW. 
* January 11, 1983, United Airlines Flight 2885, a McDonnell Douglas DC-8F cargo flight with 3 occupants aboard crashed after takeoff due to a mistrimmed stabilizer causing a loss of control, all on board were killed.
* March 4, 1987, Northwest Airlink Flight 2268, operated by Fischer Brothers Aviation, a CASA 212 was on a scheduled flight from Mansfield to Detroit with an intermediate stop in Cleveland when it crashed while landing at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. The plane yawed violently to the left about above the runway, skidded to the right, hit three ground support vehicles in front of Concourse F, and caught fire. Of 19 occupants onboard (16 passengers and three crew), nine were killed. The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error.
* August 16, 1987, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82 operating as Northwest Airlines Flight 255, bound for Phoenix, Arizona, crashed on take-off from Metro&#x27;s Runway 3 Center (Now Runway 3L). All but one passenger on the aircraft were killed; the lone survivor was a young girl, Cecelia Cichan, who lost both of her parents and her brother. The NTSB determined that the accident resulted from flight crew&#x27;s failure to deploy the aircraft&#x27;s flaps prior to take-off, resulting in a lack of necessary lift. The aircraft slammed into an overpass bridge on I-94 just northeast of the departure end of the runway.
* December 3, 1990, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-14 operating as Northwest Airlines Flight 1482, bound for Pittsburgh, collided with a Boeing 727-200 Adv. operating as Northwest Airlines Flight 299, bound for Memphis, on runway 03C. Seven passengers and a flight attendant on Flight 1482 were killed. The cause of the accident is listed as &quot;pilot error&quot;.
* January 9, 1997, an Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia aircraft operating as Comair Flight 3272 crashed nose down from the airport while on approach into Detroit. All 26 passengers and 3 crew members were killed. The cause is listed to be the &quot;FAA&#x27;s failure to establish adequate aircraft certification standards for flight in icing conditions, the FAA&#x27;s failure to ensure that an FAA/CTA-approved procedure for the accident airplane&#x27;s deice system operation was implemented by U.S.-based air carriers, and the FAA&#x27;s failure to require the establishment of adequate minimum airspeeds for icing conditions.&quot;
*March 17, 2001, an Airbus A320-200 operating as Northwest Airlines Flight 985 bound for Miami, Florida, prematurely rotated during takeoff from runway 3C. The captain aborted the takeoff, and the aircraft skidded off the runway. All 151 occupants survived. The cause of the accident was the captain&#x27;s delayed rejection of the takeoff, and the flight crew had incorrectly set the trim of the horizontal stabilizer.
*December 25, 2009, Nigerian national Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to detonate an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253, an Airbus A330 from Amsterdam to Detroit as the plane was approaching Detroit. The device failed to go off correctly, and the suspect suffered burns to his lower body. Three other passengers had minor injuries. The White House said it considered the incident an attempted terrorist attack.

<text>In computer programming, indentation style is a convention, a.k.a. style, governing the indentation of blocks of source code. An indentation style generally involves consistent width of whitespace (indentation size) before each line of a block, so that the lines of code appear to be related, and dictates whether to use space or tab characters for the indentation whitespace.

== Overview ==

This article primarily addresses styles for free-form programming languages. As the name implies, such language code need not follow an indentation style. Indentation is a secondary notation that is often intended to lower cognitive load for a programmer to understand the structure of the code. 
Indentation can clarify the separation between the code executed based on control flow.

Structured languages, such as Python and occam, use indentation to determine the structure instead of using braces or keywords; this is termed the off-side rule. In such languages, indentation is meaningful to the language processor (such as compiler or interpreter). A programmer must conform to the language&#x27;s indentation rules although may be free to choose indentation size.

This article focuses on curly-bracket languages (that delimit blocks with curly brackets, a.k.a. curly braces, a.k.a. braces) and in particular 
C-family languages, but a convention used for one language can be adapted to another language. For example, a language that uses codice_1 and codice_2 keywords instead of braces can be adapted by treating codice_1 the same as the open brace and so on.

Indentation style only applies to text-based languages. Visual programming languages have no indentation.

== Research ==

Despite the ubiquitous use of indentation styles, little research has been conducted on its value. First experiments, conducted by Weissman in 1974, did not show any effect.
In 2023, an experiment by Morzeck et al. showed a significant positive effect for nested codice_4 statements where non-indented code required on average 179% more time to read than indented code. A follow up-experiment by Hanenberg et al. confirmed a large effect (although in that experiment non-indented code just took 113% more time to read) and revealed that the differences in reading times can be explained by the code that can be skipped (for indented code). In another experiment on JSON objects non-indented code took even 544% more time to read.

== Notable styles ==

The table below includes code examples of various indentation styles.
For consistency, indentation size for example code is 4 spaces even though this varies by coding convention.

== C/C++ styles ==

Attributes of C, C++ and other curly-brace programming language coding style include but are not limited to:
* Placement of braces relative to other code elements
* Use of tabs or spaces
* Wrapping single-statement blocks in braces. Advocates cite the advantage that resulting code is safer since inserting a statement cannot result in control flow that disagrees with indentation. A cited disadvantage is that the code is longer since one line is needed for the closing brace of a block (except for the codice_5 construct and a codice_6 block).

=== K&amp;R ===

The Kernighan &amp; Ritchie (K&amp;R) style is commonly used for C and C++ code and is the basis for many derivative styles. It is used in the original Unix kernel, Kernighan and Ritchie&#x27;s book &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;, as well as Kernighan and Plauger&#x27;s book &quot;The Elements of Programming Style&quot;.

Although &quot;The C Programming Language&quot; does not explicitly define this style, it follows it consistently. From the book:

The position of braces is less important, although people hold passionate beliefs. We have chosen one of several popular styles. Pick a style that suits you, then use it consistently.
In this style, a function has its opening and closing braces on their own lines and with the same indentation as the declaration, while the statements in the body of the function are indented an additional level. A multi-statement block inside a function, however, has its opening brace on the same line as its control clause while the closing brace remains on its own line unless followed by a keyword such as codice_7 or codice_8.

Example code:
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 while (x == y) {
 do_something();
 do_something_else();
 if (some_error)
 fix_issue(); // single-statement block without braces
 else
 continue_as_usual();
 final_thing();


==== Egyptian braces ====
The non-aligned braces of the multi-line blocks are nicknamed &quot;Egyptian braces&quot; (or &quot;Egyptian brackets&quot;) for their resemblance to arms in some fanciful poses of ancient Egyptians.

==== Single statements ====

A single-statement block does not have braces, which is a cause of easy-to-miss bugs such as the goto fail bug.

=== One True Brace ===

The &quot;One True Brace Style&quot; (abbreviated 1TBS or OTBS) is like the K&amp;R style, but functions are formatted like multi-statement blocks with the opening brace on the same line as the declaration, and braces are &quot;not&quot; omitted for a single-statement block.
bool is_negative(int x) {
 if (x &lt; 0) {
 return true;
 } else {
 return false;
}
Although not required by languages such as C/C++, using braces for single-statement blocks ensures that inserting a statement does not result in control flow that disagrees with indenting, as seen for example in Apple&#x27;s infamous goto fail bug.

Cited advantages include shorter code (than K&amp;R) since the starting brace needs no extra line, that the ending brace lines up with the statement it conceptually belongs to, and the perceived stylistic consistency of using the same brace style in both function bodies and multi-line statement blocks.

Sources disagree as to the meaning of One True Brace Style. Some say that it is the variation specified here, while others say it is &quot;hacker jargon&quot; for K&amp;R.

=== Linux kernel ===

The Linux kernel source tree is styled in a variant of K&amp;R. Linus Torvalds advises contributors to follow it. Attributes include:

* Uses tab characters for indentation (not spaces) and assumes tab stops every 8 spaces
* Brace layout matches K&amp;R, with the braces of function definitions on their own lines and the opening brace of compound statements on the same line as the control clause, separated by a space
* Labels in a codice_9 statement are aligned with the enclosing block (there is only one level of indents)
* Maximum line length is 100 characters although the pre-2020 limit of 80 characters is preferred.
* A single-statement body of a compound statement (such as if, while, and do-while) does not need to be surrounded by curly braces. If, however, one or more of the substatements in an codice_10 statement require braces, then both substatements should be wrapped in braces:
int power(int x, int y)
 int result;

 if (y &lt; 0) {
 result = 0;
 } else {
 result = 1;
 while (y-- &gt; 0)
 result *= x;
 return result;


=== Java ===

A significant body of Java code uses a variant of the K&amp;R style in which the opening brace is on the same line not only for the blocks inside a function, but also for class or method declarations.
This style is widespread largely because Sun Microsystems&#x27;s original style guides used this K&amp;R variant, and as a result, most of the standard source code for the Java API is written in this style. It is also a popular indentation style for ActionScript and JavaScript, along with the Allman style.

=== Stroustrup ===

Bjarne Stroustrup adapted the K&amp;R style for C++ in his books, such as &quot;Programming: Principles and Practice using C++&quot; and &quot;The C++ Programming Language&quot;.

Unlike the variants above, Stroustrup does not use a &quot;cuddled else&quot;. Thus, Stroustrup would write
 if (x &lt; 0) {
 puts(&quot;Negative&quot;);
 negative(x);
 else {
 puts(&quot;Non-negative&quot;);
 nonnegative(x);


Stroustrup extends K&amp;R style for classes, writing them as follows:
 class Vector {
 public:
 // construct a Vector
 Vector(int s) :elem(new double[s]), sz(s) { }
 // element access: subscripting
 double&amp; operator[](int i) { return elem[i]; }
 int size() { return sz; }
 private:
 // pointer to the elements
 double * elem;
 // number of elements
 int sz;


Stroustrup does not indent the labels and . Also, in this style, while the opening brace of a function starts on a new line, the opening brace of a class is on the same line as the class name.

Stroustrup allows writing short functions all on one line. Stroustrup style is a named indentation style available in the editor Emacs. Stroustrup encourages a K&amp;R-derived style layout with C++ as stated in his modern &quot;C++ Core Guidelines&quot;.

=== BSD KNF ===

The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) operating systems uses a style that is sometimes termed kernel normal form (KNF). Although mostly intended for kernel code, it is also widely used in userland code. It is essentially a thoroughly documented variant of K&amp;R style as used in the Bell Labs version 6 &amp; 7 Unix source code.

The SunOS kernel and userland uses a similar indentation style. Like KNF, this also was based on AT&amp;T style documents and is sometimes termed Bill Joy Normal Form. The SunOS guideline was published in 1996; ANSI C is discussed briefly. The correctness of the indentation of a list of source files can be verified by the &quot;cstyle&quot; program written by Bill Shannon.

In this style, the hard tabulator (ts in vi) is kept at eight columns, while a soft tabulator is often defined as a helper also (sw in vi), and set at four. The hard tabulators are used to indent code blocks, while a soft tabulator (four spaces) of additional indentation is used for all continuing lines that must be split over multiple lines.

Moreover, function calls do not use a space before the parenthesis, although C-language native statements such as codice_4, codice_8, codice_13, codice_9 and codice_15 do (in the case where codice_15 is used with parens). Functions that declare no local variables in their top-level block should also leave an empty line after their opening block brace.

Examples:
while (x == y) {
 something();
 something_else();
final_thing();

if (data != NULL &amp;&amp; res &gt; 0) {
 if (JS_DefineProperty(cx, o, &quot;data&quot;,
 STRING_TO_JSVAL(JS_NewStringCopyN(cx, data, res)),
 NULL, NULL, JSPROP_ENUMERATE) != 0) {
 QUEUE_EXCEPTION(&quot;Internal error!&quot;);
 goto err;
 PQfreemem(data);
} else {
 if (JS_DefineProperty(cx, o, &quot;data&quot;, OBJECT_TO_JSVAL(NULL),
 NULL, NULL, JSPROP_ENUMERATE) != 0) {
 QUEUE_EXCEPTION(&quot;Internal error!&quot;);
 goto err;
}

static JSBool
pgresult_constructor(JSContext *cx, JSObject *obj, uintN argc,
 jsval *argv, jsval *rval)

 QUEUE_EXCEPTION(&quot;PGresult class not user-instantiable&quot;);

 return (JS_FALSE);


=== Allman ===
The Allman style is named after Eric Allman. It is also sometimes termed &quot;BSD style&quot; since Allman wrote many of the utilities for BSD Unix (although this should not be confused with the different &quot;BSD KNF style&quot;; see above).

This style puts the brace associated with a control statement on the next line, indented to the same level as the control statement. Statements within the braces are indented to the next level.
while (x == y)
 something();
 something_else();

final_thing();
This style is similar to the standard indentation used by the Pascal languages and Transact-SQL, where the braces are equivalent to the keywords codice_17 and codice_18.
(* Example Allman code indentation style in Pascal *)
procedure dosomething(x, y: Integer);
begin
 while x = y do
 begin
 something();
 something_else();
 end;
end;
Consequences of this style are that the indented code is clearly set apart from the containing statement by lines that are almost all whitespace and the closing brace lines up in the same column as the opening brace. Some people feel this makes it easy to find matching braces. The blocking style also delineates the block of code from the associated control statement. Commenting out or removing a control statement or block of code, or code refactoring, are all less likely to introduce syntax errors via dangling or missing braces. Also, it is consistent with brace placement for the outer-function block.

For example, the following is still correct syntactically:
// while (x == y)
 something();
 something_else();

As is this:

// for (int i=0; i &lt; x; i++)
// while (x == y)
if (x == y)
 something();
 something_else();


Even like this, with conditional compilation:
 int c;
#ifdef HAS_GETCH
 while ((c = getch()) != EOF)
#else
 while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
#endif
 do_something(c);


==== Variant: Allman-8 ====
Allman-8 uses the 8-space indentation tabs and 80-column limit of the Linux Kernel variant of K&amp;R. The style purportedly helps improve readability on projectors. Also, the indentation size and column restriction help create a visual cue for identifying excessive nesting of code blocks. These advantages combine to help provide newer developers and learners implicit guidance to manage code complexity.

=== Whitesmiths ===
The Whitesmiths style, also sometimes termed Wishart style, was originally used in the documentation for the first commercial C compiler, the Whitesmiths Compiler. It was also popular in the early days of Windows, since it was used in three influential Windows programming books, &quot;Programmer&#x27;s Guide to Windows&quot; by Durant, Carlson &amp; Yao, &quot;Programming Windows&quot; by Petzold, and &quot;Windows 3.0 Power Programming Techniques&quot; by Norton &amp; Yao.

Whitesmiths, along with Allman, were claimed to have been the most common bracing styles in 1991 by the Jargon File, with roughly equal popularity at the time.

This style puts the brace associated with a control statement on the next line, indented. Statements within the braces are indented to the same level as the braces.

Like Ratliff style, the closing brace is indented the same as statements within the braces.
while (x == y)
 something();
 something_else();

final_thing();
The advantages of this style are similar to those of the Allman style. Blocks are clearly set apart from control statements. The alignment of the braces with the block emphasizes that the full block is conceptually, and programmatically, one compound statement. Indenting the braces emphasizes that they are subordinate to the control statement. The ending brace no longer lines up with the statement, but instead with the opening brace.

An example:
if (data != NULL &amp;&amp; res &gt; 0)
 if (!JS_DefineProperty(cx, o, &quot;data&quot;, STRING_TO_JSVAL(JS_NewStringCopyN(cx, data, res)), NULL, NULL, JSPROP_ENUMERATE))
 QUEUE_EXCEPTION(&quot;Internal error!&quot;);
 goto err;
 PQfreemem(data);
else if (!JS_DefineProperty(cx, o, &quot;data&quot;, OBJECT_TO_JSVAL(NULL), NULL, NULL, JSPROP_ENUMERATE))
 QUEUE_EXCEPTION(&quot;Internal error!&quot;);
 goto err;


codice_5 are treated as statement, much like the codice_20 preprocessor statement.

=== GNU ===
Like the Allman and Whitesmiths styles, GNU style puts braces on a line by themselves, indented by two spaces, except when opening a function definition, where they are not indented. In either case, the contained code is indented by two spaces from the braces.

Popularised by Richard Stallman, the layout may be influenced by his background of writing Lisp code. In Lisp, the equivalent to a block (a progn) is a first-class data entity, and giving it its own indentation level helps to emphasize that, whereas in C, a block is only syntax. This style can also be found in some ALGOL and XPL programming language textbooks from the 1960s and 1970s.

Although not indentation per se, GNU coding style also includes a space after a function name before the left parenthesis of an argument list.
static char *
concat (char *s1, char *s2)
 while (x == y)
 something ();
 something_else ();
 final_thing ();


This style combines the advantages of Allman and Whitesmiths, thereby removing the possible Whitesmiths disadvantage of braces not standing out from the block. One disadvantage is that the ending brace no longer lines up with the statement it conceptually belongs to. Another possible disadvantage is that it might waste space by using two visual levels of indents for one conceptual level, but in reality this is unlikely because, in systems with single-level indentation, each level is usually at least 4 spaces, same as 2 * 2 spaces in GNU style.

The GNU Coding Standards recommend this style, and nearly all maintainers of GNU project software use it.

The GNU Emacs text editor and the GNU systems&#x27; indent command will reformat code according to this style by default. Those who do not use GNU Emacs, or similarly extensible/customisable editors, may find that the automatic indentation settings of their editor are unhelpful for this style. However, many editors defaulting to KNF style cope well with the GNU style when the tab width is set to two spaces; likewise, GNU Emacs adapts well to KNF style by simply setting the tab width to eight spaces. In both cases, automatic reformatting destroys the original spacing, but automatic line indenting will work properly.

Steve McConnell, in his book Code Complete, advises against using this style: he marks a code sample which uses it with a &quot;Coding Horror&quot; icon, symbolizing especially dangerous code, and states that it impedes readability. The Linux kernel coding style documentation also recommends against this style, urging readers to burn a copy of the GNU coding standards as a &quot;great symbolic gesture&quot;.

=== Horstmann ===
The 1997 edition of &quot;Computing Concepts with C++ Essentials&quot; by Cay S. Horstmann adapts Allman by placing the first statement of a block on the same line as the opening brace. This style is also used in examples in Jensen and Wirth&#x27;s &quot;Pascal User Manual and Report&quot;.
while (x == y)
{ something();
 something_else();
 if (x &lt; 0)
 { printf(&quot;Negative&quot;);
 negative(x);
 else
 { printf(&quot;Non-negative&quot;);
 nonnegative(x);
}
final_thing();
This style combines the advantages of Allman by keeping the vertical alignment of the braces for readability, and identifying blocks easily, with the saving of a line of the K&amp;R style. However, the 2003 edition now uses Allman style throughout.

=== Pico ===
This is the style used most commonly in the language Pico by its designers. Pico lacks return statements, and uses semicolons as statement separators instead of terminators. It yields this syntax:


The advantages and disadvantages are similar to those of saving screen real estate with K&amp;R style. An added advantage is that the starting and closing braces are consistent in application (both share space with a line of code), relative to K&amp;R style, where one brace shares space with a line of code and one brace has a line alone.

=== Ratliff ===
In the book &quot;Programmers at Work&quot;,

C. Wayne Ratliff,
the original programmer behind the popular dBase-II and -III fourth-generation programming languages, 
discussed a style that is like 1TBS but the closing brace lines up with the indentation of the nested block. 
He indicated that the style was originally documented in material from Digital Research Inc. This style has sometimes been termed &quot;banner&quot; style, possibly for the resemblance to a banner hanging from a pole. In this style, which is to Whitesmiths as K&amp;R is to Allman, the closing control is indented the same as the last item in the list (and thus properly loses salience) The style can make visual scanning easier for some, since the &quot;headers&quot; of any block are the only thing exdented at that level (the theory being that the closing control of the prior block interferes with the visual flow of the next block header in the K&amp;R and Allman styles). Kernighan and Plauger use this style in the Ratfor code in &quot;Software Tools&quot;.
 // In C
 for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
 if (i % 2 == 0) {
 do_something(i);
 else {
 do_something_else(i);
 }
== C derived language styles ==

The following styles are common for various languages derived from C that are both significantly similar and dissimilar.
And, they can be adapted to C as well.
They might be applied to C code written as part of a project &quot;mostly&quot; written in one of these other languages, where maintaining a consistent &quot;look and feel&quot; to the project&#x27;s core code overrides considerations of using more conventional C style.

=== Lisp style ===

While GNU style is sometimes characterized as C code indented by a Lisp programmer, one might even go so far as to insert closing braces together in the last line of a block. This style makes indentation the only way to distinguish blocks of code, but has the advantage of containing no uninformative lines. This could easily be called the Lisp style because this style is very common in Lisp code.
In Lisp, the grouping of identical braces at the end of expression trees is meant to signify that it is not the user&#x27;s job to visually track nesting levels, only to understand the structure of the tree.

The traditional Lisp variant of this style prefers extremely narrow levels of indentation (typically two spaces) because Lisp code usually nests very deeply since Lisp features only expressions, with no distinct class of statements; function arguments are mostly indented to the same level to illustrate their shared status within the enclosing expression. This is also because, braces aside, Lisp is conventionally a very terse language, omitting even common forms of simple boilerplate code as uninformative, such as the codice_7 keyword in an codice_22 block, instead rendering it uniformly as codice_23.
// C
for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
 {if (i % 2 == 0)
 {do_something(i);}
 else
 {do_something_else(i);
 do_third_thing(i);}}
 

;; Lisp
(dotimes (i 10)
 (if (= (rem i 2) 0)
 (do-something i)
 (progn
 (do-something-else i)
 (do-third-thing i))))

Note: codice_24 is a procedure for evaluating multiple sub-expressions sequentially for effects, while discarding all but the final (nth) return value. If all return values are desired, the codice_25 procedure would be used.

=== Haskell style ===

Haskell layout can make the placement of braces optional, although braces and semicolons are allowed in the language.

The two segments below are equally acceptable to the compiler:
braceless = do
 text &lt;- getContents
 let
 firstWord = head $ words text
 bigWord = map toUpper firstWord
 putStrLn bigWord

braceful = do
 { text &lt;- getContents
 ; let
 { firstWord = head $ words text
 ; bigWord = map toUpper firstWord
 ; putStrLn bigWord


In Haskell, layout can replace braces.
Usually the braces and semicolons are omitted for procedural codice_13 sections and the program text in general, but the style is commonly used for lists, records and other syntactic elements made up of some pair of parentheses or braces, which are separated with commas or semicolons. If code following the keywords codice_27, codice_28, or codice_29 omits braces and semicolons, then indentation is significant.

=== APL style ===

For an example of how terse APL typically is, here is the implementation of the step function for the Game of Life:

life←{⊃1⍵∨.∧3 4=+/+⌿¯1 0 1∘.⊖¯1 0 1⌽¨⊂⍵}

APL style C resembles the terse style of APL code, and is commonly used in their implementations. This style was pioneered by Arthur Whitney, and is heavily used in the implementation of K, Arthur&#x27;s own project. The J programming language is implemented in this style as well. Notably, not all implementations of APL use this style of C, namely: GNU APL and Dyalog APL.

In addition to APL style C indentation, typically the names are shortened to either single or double characters: To reduce the amount of indentation, and expressions spanning multiple lines.

== Indentation size ==

Typically, programmers use the same width of whitespace to indent each block of code with commonly used widths varying from 1 to 4 spaces.

An experiment performed on PASCAL code in 1983, found that indentation size significantly affected comprehensibility. Indentation sizes between 2 and 4 characters proved optimal.

Although they both affect the general layout of code, indentation &quot;size&quot; is independent of the indentation &quot;style&quot; discussed here.

=== Tab vs. space ===

Typically, a programmer uses a text editor that provides tab stops at fixed intervals (a number of spaces), to assist in maintaining whitespace according to a style. The interval is called the &quot;tab width&quot;. Sometimes the programmer stores the code with tab characters one for each tab key press or they store a sequence of spaces equal in number to the tab width.

Storing tab characters in code can cause visual misalignment when viewed in different contexts, which counters the value of the indentation style.

Programmers lack consensus on storing tab characters.
Proponents of storing tab characters cite ease of typing and smaller text files since a single tab character serves the purpose of multiple spaces. Opponents, such as Jamie Zawinski, state that using spaces instead increases cross-platform portability.
 Others, such as the writers of the WordPress coding standards, state the opposite: that hard tabs increase portability. A survey of the top 400,000 repositories on GitHub found that spaces are more common.

Many text editors, including Notepad++, TextEdit, Emacs, vi, and nano, can be configured to either store tab characters when entered via the tab key or to convert them to spaces (based on the configured tab width) so that tab characters are not added to the file when the tab key is pressed. Some editors can convert tab to space characters and vice versa.

Some text file pagers, such as less, can be configured for a tab width. Some tools such as expand/unexpand can convert on the fly via filters.

== Style automation ==
A tool can automate formatting code per an indentation style, for example the Unix codice_30 command.

Emacs provides commands to modify indentation, including hitting codice_31 on a given line. codice_32 indents code.

Elastic tabstops is a tabulation style which requires support from the text editor, where entire blocks of text are kept automatically aligned when the length of one line in the block changes.

== Losing track of blocks ==
In more complicated code, the programmer may lose track of block boundaries while reading the code.
This is often experienced in large sections of code containing many compound statements nested to many levels of indentation.
As the programmer scrolls to the bottom of a huge set of nested statements, they may lose track of context such as the control structure at the top of the block.

Long compound statements can be a code smell of over complexity which can be solved by refactoring.

Programmers who rely on counting the opening braces may have difficulty with indentation styles such as K&amp;R, where the starting brace is not visually separated from its control statement. Programmers who rely more on indentations will gain more from styles that are vertically compact, such as K&amp;R, because the blocks are shorter.

To avoid losing track of control statements such as codice_33, a large indentation can be used, such as an 8-unit-wide hard tab, along with breaking up large functions into smaller and more readable functions. Linux is done this way, while using the K&amp;R style.

Some text editors allow the programmer to jump between the two corresponding braces of a block. 
For example, vi jumps to the brace enclosing the same block as the one under the cursor when pressing the codice_34 key.
Since the text cursor&#x27;s codice_35 key (viz., the codice_36 key) retained directional positioning information (whether the codice_37 or codice_38 key was formerly pressed), the dot macro (the codice_39 key) could then be used to place the text cursor on the next brace, given a suitable coding style. Instead, inspecting the block boundaries using the codice_34 key can be used to enforce a coding standard.

Another way to maintain block awareness, is to use comments after the closing brace. For example:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; total; i++) {
 foo();
} //for (i)

if (x &lt; 0) {
 bar();
} //if (x &lt; 0)
A disadvantage is maintaining the same code in multiple locations above and below the block.

Some editors provide support for maintaining block awareness. A folding editor can hide (fold) and reveal (unfold) blocks by indentation level. Some editors highlight matching braces when the cursor is positioned next to one.

<text>Asheville Regional Airport is a Class C airport near Interstate 26 and the town of Fletcher, North Carolina, south of downtown Asheville. It is owned by the Greater Asheville Regional Airport Authority. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019–2023 categorized it as a small-hub primary commercial service facility. In 2023 it served an all-time record number of passengers for the airport, 2,246,411, an increase of 22.2% over 2022.

The airport opened initially with a 6500-foot runway in 1961, replacing the former airport at .

== History ==
A Concorde supersonic transport (SST) visited AVL during a 1987 promotional tour and was snowed in overnight. Chartered Boeing 747s (operated by United Airlines) have visited, as has an Airbus A340 during the visit of Charles, Prince of Wales, to the nearby Biltmore Estate in 1996. AVL&#x27;s runway can handle almost any aircraft.

In April 2010, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama landed in Asheville aboard a Boeing C-32 (the USAF version of the Boeing 757-200) for a weekend getaway. In October 2011 President Obama landed in Asheville in the larger Boeing VC-25 (the USAF version of the Boeing 747-200) to kick off his North Carolina and Virginia bus tour promoting his jobs bill. He gave a speech at the airport, and cited potential enhancements at the airport as part of the jobs push. President Obama returned to Asheville on February 13, 2013, on the same aircraft for a brief visit and speech at a nearby manufacturing facility.

The terminal building opened on June 7, 1961 (the airport opened in January 1961). A $20 million expansion and renovation project began in 1987. The expansion project was completed in 1992, which resulted in an expansion of the ticket lobby, baggage claim area, and administrative office space. A second-level boarding area and jetways were constructed, as well as an atrium to the existing lobby. The second-level boarding area was removed and the ground-level boarding areas were expanded and renovated in 2003, designed by McCreary/Snow Architects, PA and built by Wilkie Construction Company, Inc. In 2009, $17.8 million of improvements were completed, including a Guest Services center, an additional baggage carousel, rental car desks, offices and security enhancements. In November 2017, a new 1,300-space parking deck opened in front of the airport terminal.

As part of Project SOAR (Significant Opportunity for Aviation in our Region), a major airport improvement project, the existing runway (which was over 50 years old) was nearing the end of its useful life and required major reconstruction to continue its use into the future. Also, the existing runway did not meet the most current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements that were put in place long after the runway was originally constructed. In December 2015, a temporary runway was opened west of the existing runway (16/34). The temporary runway 35 Instrument Landing System (ILS) is operational, and Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPI) are available on both ends of the runway. The runway magnetic compass heading has shifted slightly over the years, and runway 16/34 has been renamed to runway 17/35. The new runway entered service on November 5, 2020.

In 2023 the airport began work on a multi-phase renovation and expansion of the terminal building. The new terminal will include , 150% larger than the current space, with 12 gates instead of the current seven and additional room for expansion. The renovated and expanded terminal is being constructed on the site of the existing terminal, necessitating a multi-year approach to its construction. The old terminal is being demolished, starting with the north end first. The project also includes the construction of a new air traffic control tower on the southwest edge of the airport. Construction on the $44 million, tower began in 2023 and is scheduled for completion in 2025. 

Asheville Regional Airport is a focus city for Allegiant Air which bases Airbus A320 family aircraft and crew at the airport.

=== Airline service: 1948-1996 ===
In 1948, Capital Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989) served the former Asheville airport, all with Douglas DC-3s. Capital flew nonstop to Charlotte and Knoxville; Delta flew nonstop to Greenville, SC, and Knoxville; Piedmont flew nonstop to Tri-Cities, TN and Charlotte.

In 1959, the Asheville City Council would purchase property partially located in neighboring Henderson County for the development of the airport. The North Carolina General Assembly would pass a bill that would to redesign the boundaries of Buncombe and Henderson to include the proposed airport property entirely in Buncombe, allowing Asheville to annex the complete site.

In 1961, Capital Airlines flew Vickers Viscounts into the recently opened new airport with nonstop service to Atlanta, GA, Tri-Cities, TN and Winston/Salem. Capital was acquired by and merged into United Airlines which in 1963 flew Viscounts and Douglas DC-6Bs nonstop to Atlanta, Greensboro, Raleigh/Durham and Washington D.C. National Airport. In 1966 Delta had one daily flight from Asheville, a Douglas DC-7 nonstop to Knoxville and direct to Louisville and Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport. In 1966 Piedmont Fairchild F-27s and Martin 4-0-4s flew nonstop to Atlanta, Charlotte, Knoxville, Roanoke and Tri-Cities, TN.

Piedmont Airlines introduced Boeing 727-100s in 1967, a typical routing being Atlanta - Asheville - Winston/Salem - Roanoke - New York LaGuardia Airport. In 1969 United Boeing 737-200s flew nonstop to Atlanta and Raleigh/Durham while Delta McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s flew nonstop to Knoxville with same plane service to Louisville and Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport.

The April 1975 Official Airline Guide listed Delta, Piedmont and United serving Asheville. Delta had one daily McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 from Knoxville, originating at Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport via Louisville. Piedmont flew Boeing 737-200s, Fairchild Hiller FH-227s and NAMC YS-11s nonstop from Atlanta, Charleston, WV, Charlotte, Danville, VA, Fayetteville, NC, Greenville/Spartanburg, SC, Knoxville, Lynchburg, VA, Nashville, Roanoke, Tri-Cities, TN and Winston/Salem, and direct 737s from Memphis, Richmond, VA and Washington D.C. National Airport. United was flying nonstop Boeing 737-200s from Atlanta, Charleston, WV and Raleigh/Durham. In 1976 United flew direct to Tampa via Atlanta; in 1978 Piedmont 737s flew direct to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport via Tri-Cities, TN.

Piedmont was the only jet airline at Asheville in February 1985, with Boeing 727-200 and Fokker F28 Fellowship nonstops from Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte and Roanoke and one-stop 727s from Denver, Miami and New York LaGuardia Airport, plus one-stop F28s from New York Newark Airport according to the Official Airline Guide. This same OAG also lists nonstop Delta Connection (operated by Atlantic Southeast Airlines) de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7s and Short 360s from Atlanta, and Sunbird Airlines and Wheeler Airlines Beechcraft 99s from Charlotte and Raleigh/Durham, plus Wheeler nonstops from Tri-Cities, TN.

American Eagle BAe Jetstream 31s and Saab 340s began serving AVL from Nashville in 1986 and Raleigh-Durham in 1987. These flights ended in 1995 when American closed both hubs.

The April 1995 OAG listed six airlines at Asheville: American Eagle, Delta, Delta Connection (operated by both Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) and Comair), USAir (which had merged with Piedmont in 1989) and USAir Express. Delta and Delta Connection (ASA) had a total of eight nonstops a day from Atlanta, Delta on McDonnell Douglas MD-80s and Delta Connection on ATR 72s and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias. Delta Connection (operated by Comair) also had three EMB-120 Brasilias a day from Cincinnati, a Delta hub. USAir and USAir Express had a total of nine nonstops a day from the USAir hub in Charlotte, USAir with Boeing 737-300s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s and USAir Express with Short 360s. USAir Express also had three nonstop Jetstream 31s a day from Raleigh/Durham, some stopping in Greenville/Spartanburg. Delta ended mainline jets to AVL in December 1995, with ASA taking over with British Aerospace 146 regional jets; however, Delta currently operates mainline Boeing 717-200 service nonstop to its Atlanta hub.

In 1996, Midway Airlines briefly flew to its hub at Raleigh-Durham via Midway Connection partner Corporate Airlines Jetstream 31s.

=== 2023 expansion ===
As of 2023, the airport is undergoing expansion and reconstruction. Once the construction work is finished the terminal will be 150% larger than currently and will have 12 rather than 7 gates. It will be two-story rather than single story when complete. The groundbreaking ceremony for the terminal occurred 11 August 2023. The new air-traffic control tower will be ready in 2025 and ground breaking was January 2023. The completed project is scheduled for 2026. 175 million dollars in bonds was approved by the state treasurer for the project. The total cost of the project has been cited as 400 million dollars. Jet bridges will be added as part of the project as currently manual ramps are pushed up to the planes.

On July 19, 1967, Piedmont Airlines Flight 22, a Boeing 727-100, collided in mid-air with a Cessna 310 just south of the airport in Hendersonville. The collision happened just moments after the 727 took off from the Asheville Airport. All 82 people on both planes were killed.

On March 14, 2003, a Cessna 177 Cardinal crashed into Old Fort Mountain after taking off from the airport. It killed author Amanda Davis, who was on a book tour promoting her first novel &quot;Wonder When You&#x27;ll Miss Me&quot;, and her parents.

On October 27, 2004, a Beechcraft Duke crashed about 0.8 of a mile off the departure end of Runway 34 after an apparent right engine failure, killing all four people on board.

On May 4, 2007, a 1977 Cessna 182 en route to Asheville Regional Airport crashed near the airport, killing three Georgia men. Initial reports said that rapper Jay-Z was on board. The reports were false.

On October 6, 2017, a terrorist deposited a bag containing an improvised explosive device near the entrance to the Asheville Regional Airport terminal. The bomb was set to explode the following morning at 6:00 AM but was defused after being detected by bomb-sniffing dogs. The terrorist, Michael Christopher Estes, was arrested and faced two federal charges. Estes pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful possession of an explosive in an airport on January 12, 2018; the other charge was dismissed.

On December 27, 2019, a small plane crashed in the Western North Carolina Agricultural Center parking lot adjacent to the airport shortly after takeoff. All five people on board survived with injuries and escaped before the plane exploded.

<text>Vraka (; ) is a region in Shkodër County in northern Albania. The region includes settlements located on the shore of Lake Scutari, some 7 km north of the city of Shkodër. This ethnographic region is inhabited by Serb-Montenegrins, &quot;Podgoriçani&quot; (Slavic Muslims) and Albanians; it used to be mainly inhabited by Serb-Montenegrins. A small Serbo-Montenegrin community migrated and established itself in Vraka during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The majority of the Serbo-Montenegrin community came to Vraka, Albania from Montenegro during the interwar Zogist period following 1926 and later from 1938 until 1948. By the year 2010 most of the Orthodox families returned to Montenegro and Serbia. As of 2019, there are only a few families living there (less than five).
==Settlements==
*Boriç i Vogël (Stari Borič)
*Boriç i Madh (Mladi Borič)
*Rrash-Kullaj (Raš i Kula)
*Grilë (Grilj)
*Omaraj (Omara)
* Shtoj i Vjetër (Stari Štoj)
* Shtoj i Ri (Novi Štoj)

== History ==

===Early history===
The toponym is Slavic.

According to Edith Durham the people of Vraka had fled from Bosnia and Montenegro, because of blood feud.

===Modern history===
Following the Great Eastern Crisis, from 1878 onward a small Muslim Montenegrin speaking community living in the region exists and are known as &quot;Podgoriçani&quot;, due to their origins from Podgorica in Montenegro.

In 1909, the Eparchy of Raška–Prizren had 15 protopresbyteriates, the last of which was Skadar, where the parish of Vraka contained 119 households (villages Novi Borič, Stari Borič, Grilj, Raš, Kule, Omara, Turajlije, Kamenica) with a church in Novi Borič dedicated to Assumption of the Holy Virgin, parish under Petar Mreković.

Vraka is known for having been the place where poet Millosh Gjergj Nikolla became teacher on 23 April 1933, and it was in this period that he started to write prose sketches and verses. The village of Vraka was at the time entirely inhabited by Serb-Montenegrins. The Serb school in Vrake was destroyed in 1934.

In 1990 most of the minority community of Vraka went to Montenegro. As the border opened up, many members of the community left between March–December 1991 for Montenegro and Vraka, Boriç and other nearby areas became severely depopulated. During that time with economic problems and tensions arising in areas of the former Yugoslavia, it made some 600 of them return home to Albania.

In 1992, the Morača-Rozafa Association was established.

During the Yugoslav Wars, there were incidents of violence against the Serb-Montenegrin minority in places like Boriç i Vogël and Boriç i Madh, where the Albanian government tried to forcibly take land from them. There were reports that the Albanian government also attempted to forcibly resettle Serb-Montenegrins and Podgoriçani from Boriç i Vogël, Boriç i Madh, Vraka and other places.

In March 1992, as part of state policy by Serbia and Montenegro to increase the numbers of Serbs in Kosovo, nearly 3,000 people from the Serb minority in Albania emigrated to the region after accepting a government offer for employment and housing in the area. Another wave came back due to the Kosovo War.

In the early twenty first century, the community lives largely on trade with Montenegro and communal relations with Albanian inhabitants are regarded as good by many of its members.

==Demographics==
The region serves as the centre of the Serb-Montenegrin minority in Albania (as listed in the census). The estimations of the total number of Serb-Montenegrins in the area vary from 1,000 to over 2,000. The community has retained their language, culture and religion. The minority association of the community, the &quot;Morača-Rozafa&quot;, represents the interests of this minority in Shkodër.

During the early 2010s linguists Klaus Steinke and Xhelal Ylli seeking to corroborate villages cited in past literature as being Slavic speaking carried out fieldwork in settlements of the area. Of the Shkodër area exists seven villages with a Slavophone population that speak a Montenegrin dialect.

* Boriç i Madh - one third of the population is compact and composed of Muslim Podgoriçani. 
* Boriç i Vogël - inhabited by 15 families and the Slavophone families are the only compact group of the Orthodox in Vraka. 
* Gril - the village officially has 1,090 inhabitants or 195 families, while the number of Orthodox Montenegrin families there varies between 2, 3 - 10. An Albanian school exists in Gril, along with a newly built Orthodox church that is without a priest. According to Slavophone locals the Orthodox population moved to Darragjat due to blood feuds related with Montenegro and relocated themselves to the Vraka area such as Gril between 1935 and 1936. Some Orthodox Montenegrins from the village moved to Montenegro in the 1990s with some thereafter returning to Gril. 
* Omaraj - in the village only two Orthodox Montenegrin families remain. 
* Kamicë - the village is almost deserted, with five or six minority Orthodox Montenegrin families left, alongside the few Albanian families.
* Shtoj i Ri - the village has a compact population of 17 Muslim Podgoriçani families. 
* Shtoj i Vjetër - the village has a compact population of 30 Muslim Podgoriçani families.
* Shkodër (city) - some Orthodox Montenegrin and Muslim Podgoriçani families live there.

===Families===
The surnames were forcibly changed by the Albanian government, from Slavic into Albanian ones, as part of Albanianization. The changed surnames, in Serbo-Croatian transliteration, are indicated with (→)

<doc id="294556" wikidata="Q1210697" url="?curid=294556" title="Die-in">
<text>A die-in, sometimes known as a lie-in, is a form of protest in which participants simulate being dead. Die-ins are actions that have been used by a variety of protest groups on topics such as animal rights, anti-war, against traffic violence, human rights, AIDS, gun control, racism, abortion, and environmental issues. Often, protestors occupy an area for a short time instead of being forced to leave by the police.

In the simplest form of a die-in, protesters simply lie down on the ground and pretend to be dead, sometimes covering themselves with signs or banners. The point of a die-in is to disrupt the flow of people on a street or sidewalk to grab the attention of passers-by.

In more complex forms, fake blood or blood-stained bandages are sometimes used, as well as simulated death throes and writhing from the protesters in an attempt to make the deaths appear more realistic. In other cases, protesters have surrounded the &quot;bodies&quot; in chalk outlines reminiscent of the troped outlines around murder victims. This has been done as an attempt to symbolize that the organization being protested against has &quot;murdered&quot; people. Sometimes, part of the protesting group makes speeches about what is being protested while the rest of the group lies on the ground.

== Examples ==
On 22 April 2006, thousands of protesters lay in the Francisco de Miranda avenue in Caracas, Venezuela, to protest against crime and insecurity during Hugo Chávez&#x27;s government in a protest by Movimiento Estudiantil called &quot;Acuéstate por la vida&quot; (Lie Down for Life).

On September 15, 2007, several thousand protested the Iraq war at the Capitol at Washington D.C. Hundreds &quot;lay on the ground&quot; on the Capitol lawn at the die-in. Over 190 were arrested, including ten veterans of that war.

The &quot;die&quot;-in has been used to protest police brutality in the United States. It has been used by organizers in Ferguson, Missouri to protest the St. Louis Police Department&#x27;s handling of Michael Brown&#x27;s fatal shooting case in 2014, in New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area to protest the killing of Eric Garner, and in Chicago to protest the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.

On December 15, 2018, more than 100 members of the Cambridge division of international social movement Extinction Rebellion did this in the university city centre, to call the county and city authorities to declare a climate emergency.
After the murder of George Floyd in the United States in June 2020, many demonstrations included lie-ins lasting for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the length of time initial reports said Chauvin knelt on Floyd&#x27;s neck.

On June 5, 2020, a die-in was staged outside Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#x27;s Chief Adviser house in London to protest the Dominic Cummings scandal, in which former adviser Dominic Cummings made journeys stretching the rules of the UK&#x27;s national lockdown.

<text>Reno–Tahoe International Airport is a public and military airport southeast of downtown Reno, in Washoe County, Nevada, United States. It is the state&#x27;s second busiest commercial airport after Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. The Nevada Air National Guard has the 152nd Airlift Wing southwest of the airport&#x27;s main terminal. The airport is named after both the City of Reno, Nevada and Lake Tahoe. The airspace of Reno-Tahoe Airport is controlled by the Northern California TRACON and Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center.

==History==
===Early years===
The airport was built in 1929 by Boeing Transport Inc. and named Hubbard Field after Boeing Air Transport VP and air transport pioneer Eddie Hubbard. It was acquired by United Airlines in 1936 and purchased by the City of Reno in 1953. The August 1953 OAG shows 15 scheduled departures each weekday; ten years later there were 28.

Jets (United 727s) arrived in June 1964; runway 16 (now 17R) was extended southward from 7800 to 9000 feet around that time. The airport didn&#x27;t rate a nonstop to Los Angeles until 1969; a nonstop to Chicago began in 1970.

The first terminal building was completed in time for the 1960 Winter Olympics held in Squaw Valley, California in 1960. The present ticketing lobby and concourses were built in 1979. The airport received its current name in 1994 (which honors both the city and the nearby popular tourist destination Lake Tahoe), when the terminal was named in honor of retired Air Force Reserve Major General and former U.S. Senator Howard Cannon. Prior to that the airport itself was named Cannon International Airport.

Reno–Tahoe International was the hub of Reno Air, a now-defunct airline that flew MD-80s and MD-90s to many cities until it was bought by American Airlines and later disposed of, in 2001. Reno Air&#x27;s first flight was on July 1, 1992, and its last flight was August 30, 1999. On New Year&#x27;s Eve of 2003, Continental Airlines completed the installation of self check-in in the continental United States at Reno International.

===Expansion===
In 1996, the baggage claim and ticketing area were updated with technology and decor. In 2008, the airport began a $70 million project that enhanced the baggage screening equipment and remodeled the ticketing area with a modern Tahoe theme; the project was entirely completed in 2010. In March 2013, a $24 million expansion of the airport was completed and focused on a new centralized TSA Security Checkpoint on the ground level, and above it, a shopping and dining promenade called &quot;High Mountain Marketplace&quot;. Windows in the dining areas allow views of the mountains and runways. Future projects may include updates to the concourses.

===International service===
In February 2014, the airport announced that Volaris planned to start operating non-stop service flights to Guadalajara, Mexico sometime in 2015. Since the DOT approved the route, it is Reno&#x27;s first international non-stop service since 1999. On October 7, 2014, the DOT and the airport announced that Volaris would start a twice weekly flight to Guadalajara, Mexico from Reno on December 16, 2014.

In November 2014, Thomas Cook Airlines announced that it planned to introduce twice weekly, non-stop flights from London–Gatwick to Reno starting in December 2015. It would have been the first transatlantic route from Reno Airport. However, Thomas Cook Airlines canceled these plans in May 2015 stating insufficient border control capacities at the airport to handle their Airbus A330. Finally, in September 2019, Thomas Cook went into compulsory liquidation.

==Facilities==
===Overview===
Reno–Tahoe International Airport covers at an elevation of . In the year ending June 30, 2019, the airport had 104,239 aircraft operations, with an average of 285 per day: 46% airline, 41% general aviation, 11% air taxi, and 2% military. At that time, 161 aircraft were based here: 104 single-engine, 19 multi-engine, 23 jet, 9 military, and 6 helicopter. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport (more than 10,000 enplanements per year).

It has three concrete runways: 17R/35L is ; 17L/35R is ; 8/26 is . During September through November 2010, the airport opened a new ATCT to replace the control tower that had been used for more than 50 years. It was designed by the Parsons Design Firm, which is responsible for the design of many other ATCT towers. The cost of the new tower was about 30 million dollars.

The passenger terminal is named after the late US Senator Howard Cannon. The lobby of the terminal has an exhibit with the bust of Nevada State Senator (and Nevada State Senate Minority Leader) William J. &quot;Bill&quot; Raggio. Raggio is described in the exhibit as being &quot;The Father of the Airport Authority.&quot;

===Military facilities===

The airport is also host to Reno Air National Guard Base, an approximately complex, which was established on the west side of the airport in 1954, when Air National Guard units relocated from the former Stead Air Force Base in Reno.

The base is home to the 152d Airlift Wing (152 AW), a Nevada Air National Guard unit operationally gained by the Air Mobility Command (AMC) and equipped with C-130H Hercules aircraft.

===Car rental===
The airport provides access to nine different rental car agencies, with rental car pickup available right outside the terminal building. All nine rental car counters are located in the baggage claim. After completing the rental agreement inside, vehicles may be collected from the parking structure located just outside the baggage claim.

===Taxis and limousines===
The passenger waiting area for taxis and limousines is located outside of the D Doors located north of the baggage claim.

===Bus===
Public transportation to/from the airport is available via RTC Ride bus:

* Route 12 takes passengers either to Downtown 4th Street Station or Meadowood Mall and stops at Terminal Way &amp; Villanova Drive, a short walk from the airport north of baggage claim via the marked pedestrian walkway.

===Shuttles===
Complimentary hotel shuttles stop along the curb, outside the D Doors located north of the baggage claim, to pick up passengers.

==Accidents and incidents==
* At 10:15 pm on November 24, 1971, a Northwest Orient Airlines Boeing 727 landed at the airport with the aft airstair still deployed after the aircraft had been hijacked by an unidentified man who is only known as D.B. Cooper. The aircraft had been hijacked by Cooper between Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington earlier that day. After landing in Seattle, the passengers were released. Cooper and the crew of the 727 were allowed to depart from Seattle to Mexico City with a fuel stop in Reno. The crew reported that the aft airstair had been deployed while over southern Washington. Upon landing in Reno, the aircraft was surrounded by law enforcement. An armed search quickly confirmed that Cooper was gone. The identity of the hijacker and his whereabouts remain a mystery to this day. 
* In the early morning hours of January 21, 1985, Galaxy Airlines Flight 203, a Lockheed L-188 Electra, took off from the airport for Minneapolis, Minnesota and crashed southwest of the airport while the pilots were attempting an emergency landing after experiencing an unexpected vibration from under the wing. An investigation attributed the crash to pilot error for failing to maintain proper control over the aircraft while investigating the cause of the vibration. The vibration was later found to be caused by an open air start service door which the ground crew failed to secure before departure. All but one of the 71 passengers and crew on board were killed.
* Also in 1985, Roger Stockham, who would later be arrested for attempting to blow up a mosque in Michigan, was arrested at the airport for planting a pipe bomb and carrying an unregistered weapon.
* On March 22, 1995, a Cessna 208 Caravan operated by &quot;Union Flights&quot; impacted a mountain 9 nautical miles from RNO, killing the sole occupant, the pilot. The pilot failed to comply with published instrument approach procedures and prematurely descended below the minimum altitude specified for the approach.
* On April 13, 2011, a Piper Cheyenne air ambulance flight landed uneventfully at Reno–Tahoe International Airport without a clearance, after the single overnight air traffic controller fell asleep. Federal Aviation Regulations state that if a control tower is not in operation (a condition satisfied by the fact that the controller was asleep), it is considered an &quot;uncontrolled airport&quot; with flight and ground movement becoming the responsibility of the pilot. The incident was minor in nature and safety was never compromised; however, it led to the resignation of Air Traffic Organization chief executive Hank Krakowski. The Federal Aviation Administration announced that 27 airports, including RNO, would subsequently be staffed with two air traffic controllers during graveyard shifts.

==Sound levels==
Sound levels have been analyzed for over two decades at this airport, with one of the first studies being a comprehensive production of aircraft sound level contour maps. Later analysis was conducted to analyze sound levels at Kate Smith School and provide retrofitting to reduce sound levels through a Federal Aviation Administration grant.

<text>The French West Indies or French Antilles (, ; ) are the parts of France located in the Antilles islands of the Caribbean:

* The two overseas departments of:
** Guadeloupe, including the islands of Basse-Terre, Grande-Terre, Les Saintes, Marie-Galante, and La Désirade.
** Martinique
* The two overseas collectivities of:
** Saint Martin, the northern half of the island with the same name, the southern half is Sint Maarten, a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
** Saint Barthélemy

==History==

Pierre Belain d&#x27;Esnambuc was a French trader and adventurer in the Caribbean, who established the first permanent French colony, Saint-Pierre, on the island of Martinique in 1635. Belain sailed to the Caribbean in 1625, hoping to establish a French settlement on the island of St. Christopher (St. Kitts). In 1626 he returned to France, where he won the support of Cardinal Richelieu to establish French colonies in the region. Richelieu became a shareholder in the Compagnie de Saint-Christophe, created to accomplish this with d&#x27;Esnambuc at its head. The company was not particularly successful and Richelieu had it reorganized as the Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique. In 1635 d&#x27;Esnambuc sailed to Martinique with one hundred French settlers to clear land for sugarcane plantations.

After six months on Martinique, d&#x27;Esnambuc returned to St. Christopher, where he soon died prematurely in 1636. His nephew, Jacques Dyel du Parquet, inherited d&#x27;Esnambuc&#x27;s authority over the French settlements in the Caribbean, in 1637 becoming governor of Martinique. He remained in Martinique and did not concern himself with the other islands.

The French permanently settled on Martinique and Guadeloupe after being kicked off Saint Kitts and Nevis (&quot;Saint-Christophe&quot; in French) by the British. Fort Royal (Fort-de-France) on Martinique was a major port for French warships in the region from which the French were able to explore the region. In 1638, Jacques Dyel du Parquet (1606–1658), nephew of Pierre Belain d&#x27;Esnambuc and first governor of Martinique, decided to have Fort Saint Louis built to protect the city against enemy attacks. From Fort Royal, Martinique, Du Parquet proceeded south in search for new territories and established the first settlement in Saint Lucia in 1643, and headed an expedition which established a French settlement in Grenada in 1649. Despite the long history of British rule, Grenada&#x27;s French heritage is still evidenced by the number of French loanwords in Grenadian Creole, French-style buildings, cuisine and places name (For ex. Petit Martinique, Martinique Channel, etc.)

In 1642, the Compagnie des Îles de l&#x27;Amérique received a twenty-year extension of its charter. The King would name the Governor General of the company, and the company the Governors of the various islands. By the late 1640s, in France Mazarin had little interest in colonial affairs, and the company languished. In 1651 it dissolved itself, selling its exploitation rights to various parties. The du Paquet family bought Martinique, Grenada, and Saint Lucia for 60,000 livres. The sieur d&#x27;Houël bought Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante, La Desirade and the Saintes. The Knights of Malta bought Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin, which were made dependencies of Guadeloupe. In 1665, the Knights sold the islands they had acquired to the newly formed (1664) Compagnie des Indes occidentales.

Dominica is a former French and British colony in the Eastern Caribbean, located about halfway between the French islands of Guadeloupe (to the north) and Martinique (to the south). Christopher Columbus named the island after the day of the week on which he spotted it, a Sunday (&quot;domingo&quot; in Spanish), 3 November 1493. In the hundred years after Columbus&#x27;s landing, Dominica remained isolated. At the time it was inhabited by the Island Caribs, or Kalinago people, and over time more settled there after being driven from surrounding islands, as European powers entered the region. In 1690, French woodcutters from Martinique and Guadeloupe begin to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood and gradually become permanent settlers. France had a colony for several years, they imported slaves from West Africa, Martinique and Guadeloupe to work on its plantations. In this period, the Antillean Creole language developed. France formally ceded possession of Dominica to Great Britain in 1763. Great Britain established a small colony on the island in 1805. As a result, Dominicans speak English as an official language while Antillean creole is spoken as a secondary language and is well maintained due to its location between the French-speaking departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique.

In Trinidad, the occupying Spanish had contributed little towards advancements, despite the island&#x27;s ideal location. Because it was considered underpopulated, Roume de St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in Grenada, was able to obtain a Cédula de Población from the Spanish king Charles III, on 4 November 1783, allowing French planters with their slaves, free coloreds and mulattos from the French Antilles of Martinique, Grenada, Guadeloupe and Dominica to migrate to Trinidad. The Spanish gave many incentives to lure settlers to the island, including exemption from taxes for ten years and land grants in accordance to the terms set out in the Cedula. This exodus was also encouraged by the French Revolution. These new immigrants established the local communities of Blanchisseuse, Champs Fleurs, Paramin, Cascade, Carenage and Laventille, adding to the ancestry of Trinidadians and creating the creole identity; Spanish, French, and Patois were the languages spoken. Trinidad&#x27;s population jumped from just under 1,400 in 1777, to over 15,000 by the end of 1789. In 1797, Trinidad became a British crown colony, with a French-speaking population.

The two official French overseas departments are Guadeloupe and Martinique. Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy, formerly attached to the department of Guadeloupe, have held separate status as &quot;overseas collectivities&quot; since 2007. These Caribbean &quot;Départments et Collectivités d’Outre Mer&quot; are also known as the French West Indies.

==French Caribbean==
The French Caribbean (or Francophone Caribbean) includes all the French-speaking countries in the region. It can also refer to any area that exhibits a combination of French and Caribbean cultural influences in music, cuisine, style, architecture, and so on. The Francophone Caribbean is a part of the wider French America, which includes all the French-speaking countries in the Americas.

The term varies in meaning by its usage and frame of reference. It is not used much in France, unless the speaker wants to refer to every French dependency in the Caribbean region. The term&#x27;s more ambiguous than the term &quot;French West Indies&quot;, which refers specifically to the islands that are French overseas departments, which means they have overall the same laws and regulations as departments on the mainland of France. Collectivities can be included too.

The following Caribbean regions are predominantly French-speaking and/or French Creole-speaking:
** 
** 
** 
* Sovereign state(s)
** 

==Former French West Indian islands==

In addition, some of the islands of the present and former British West Indies were once ruled by France. Among some of them, a French-based creole language is spoken, whereas in others the language is nearing extinction; specific words and expressions may vary among the islands.

<text>The British West Indies (BWI) were the territories in the West Indies under British rule, including Anguilla, the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Montserrat, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, British Honduras, British Guiana and Trinidad and Tobago. 

The Kingdom of England first established colonies in the region during the 17th century. Financed by valuable extractive commodities such as sugar production, the colonies were also at the centre of the Atlantic slave trade, with around 2.3 million slaves being brought to the British West Indies. The colonies also served as bases to project the power of the British Empire through the Royal Navy and Britain&#x27;s Merchant Marine, and to expand and protect British overseas trade. Before the decolonization of the Americas in the later 1950s and 1960s, the term &quot;British West Indies&quot; was regularly used to include all British colonies in the region as part of the British Empire. Following the independence of most of the territories from the United Kingdom, the term Commonwealth Caribbean is now used.

In 1912, the British government divided their territories into different colonies: The Bahamas, Barbados, British Guiana, British Honduras, Jamaica (with its dependencies the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Cayman Islands), Trinidad and Tobago, the Windward Islands, and the Leeward Islands. Between 1958 and 1962, all of the island territories except the British Virgin Islands, the Bahamas and Bermuda were organised into the West Indies Federation. It was hoped that the Federation would become independent as a single nation, but it had limited powers and faced many practical problems. Consequently, the West Indies Federation was dissolved in 1962.

The territories are now fully independent sovereign states, except for five – Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands – which remain British Overseas Territories, as does Bermuda. All remain within the Commonwealth of Nations. They also established the Caribbean Community, and many of the nations have joined various international bodies, such as the Organization of American States, the Association of Caribbean States, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations, and the Caribbean Development Bank among others.

* Turks and Caicos Islands (British overseas territory)

==History==

The origins of the British West Indies lie in outposts established to support English pirates and privateers who were involved in raiding Spanish treasure fleets, and merchants interested in trade. Charles Leigh, an English merchant, established a short-lived settlement on the Wiapoco River in 1604 (now the Oyapock, which forms the border between French Guiana and Brazil). This was followed by failed attempts to established settlements in Saint Lucia in 1605 and Grenada in 1609. The first permanent settlement was established in St. Christopher (St. Kitts) by Thomas Warner. This was followed by settlements in Barbados in 1627, Nevis in 1628, and Montserrat and Antigua in 1632. Providence Island was colonised by English Puritans in 1630, but the colony was destroyed by the Spanish in 1641. The capture of Jamaica in 1655 expanded British control beyond these small islands in the Lesser Antilles.

===Leeward Islands===
Sir William Stapleton established the first federation in the British West Indies in 1674. He set up a General Assembly of the Leeward Islands in St. Kitts. Stapleton&#x27;s federation was active between 1674 and 1685, during his term as governor, and the General Assembly met regularly until 1711.

By the 18th century, each island had kept its own Assembly and made its own laws. The islands continued to share one Governor and one Attorney-General. Although unpopular, Stapleton&#x27;s federation was never really dissolved but simply replaced by other arrangements.
Between 1816 and 1833, the Leewards were divided into two groups: St. Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla and Antigua-Barbuda-Montserrat, each with its own Governor. In 1833, all the Leeward Islands were brought together, and Dominica was added, remaining as part of the group until 1940. 

In 1869, Governor Benjamin Pine was assigned to organise a federation of Antigua-Barbuda, Dominica, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. St. Kitts and Nevis opposed sharing their government funds with Antigua and Montserrat, which were bankrupt. Governor Pine told the Colonial Office that the scheme had failed due to &quot;local prejudice and self-interest&quot;. His only achievement was to give the Leewards a single Governor. All laws and ordinances had to be approved by each island council.

In 1871, the British government passed the Leeward Islands Act, by which all the islands were under one Governor and one set of laws. The Federal Colony was composed of all islands organised under Governor Pine&#x27;s previous attempt. Each island was called a &quot;Presidency&quot; under its own Administrator or Commissioner. Like earlier groupings, this federation was unpopular but it continued until 1956, when it was redefined as the Territory of the Leeward Islands. In 1958, the Federation of the West Indies was organised, of which the Leeward Islands became a part.

===Windward Islands===
In 1833, the Windward Islands became a formal union called the Windward Islands Colony. In 1838, Trinidad (acquired in 1802) and St. Lucia (acquired in 1814) were brought into the Windward Islands Colony, but were not given their own assemblies (having previously been Crown Colonies). In 1840 Trinidad left the Colony. Barbados wished to retain its separate identity and ancient institutions, and the other colonies did not want to associate with it. The individual islands resisted British attempts at closer union. Barbados in particular fought to retain its own Assembly and left the union in 1884. Power for the union was then transferred to Grenada as overseer of the bloc.

From 1885 to 1958, the Windward Islands Colony included Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Lucia during the entire period. Tobago left in 1889, forming a union with Trinidad. Dominica joined the Windward Islands Colony in 1940, after having been transferred from the Leewards, and remained in the Colony until 1958. After 1885 the Windward Islands Colony was under one Governor-General in Grenada, and each island had its own Lieutenant-Governor and its own assembly (as before). Attempts to create a Federal Colony, as in the Leewards, were always resisted. The Windward Islands Colony broke up in 1958 when each island chose to join the new Federation of the West Indies as a separate unit.

===Jamaica and dependencies===

The Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands were grouped under Jamaica out of convenience and sometimes for historical and/or geographical reasons. British Honduras (later Belize) was surrounded by hostile Spanish colonies and needed the protection afforded by the Jamaican Army and Navy. In addition, British Honduras had been founded by loggers. It increased in population partly by the settlement of Englishmen migrating from Jamaica in the late 17th and early 18th centuries (settlers also immigrated directly from England; others were born in the colony.) From 1742, British Honduras was a dependency directly under the Governor of Jamaica. In 1749 the Governors of Jamaica appointed Administrators for British Honduras.

In 1862, British Honduras became a Crown Colony; it was placed under the Governor of Jamaica with its own Lieutenant-Governor. In 1884 it finally broke all administrative ties with Jamaica and wanted self governance, as did Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

===West Indies Federation===
The West Indies Federation was a short-lived federation that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962. It consisted of several Caribbean colonies of the United Kingdom. The Federation&#x27;s purpose was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state, similar to the Federation of Australia or Canadian Confederation. The Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how it would be governed before that could develop.

=== West Indies Associated States ===

In 1967, following the termination of the West Indies Federation, a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association form of government along with the United Kingdom called the West Indies Associated States. The arrangement was created through the British House of Commons passing the &quot;West Indies Act (1967)&quot; (also known as the &quot;Associated States Act&quot;). As part of the arrangement more sovereignty was granted to the bloc of West Indies countries with the United Kingdom maintaining responsibility for defence and external affairs only.

=== Territories today ===
Although most of the British West Indies seceded from British rule and were granted independence, several opted to remain British territories. Those territories include:

* Anguilla
* Bermuda (sometimes included as part of the BWI)
* British Virgin Islands
* Cayman Islands
* Montserrat
* Turks and Caicos Islands

==Sport==

===Cricket===
Cricket has traditionally been the main sport in the British West Indies (though others sports such as football have challenged its dominance since the 1990s). Most of the countries and territories listed above field a combined cricket team called the West Indies, which is one of the twelve elite international teams that play at Test match level. The West Indies hosted the 2007 Cricket World Cup of ODI Cricket and the 2010 ICC World Twenty20.

<text>West Virginia International Yeager Airport is a public airport east of downtown Charleston, in unincorporated Kanawha County, West Virginia, United States. It is owned by the Central West Virginia Regional Airport Authority. The airport hosts McLaughlin Air National Guard Base, home to eight C-130 Hercules aircraft of the West Virginia Air National Guard&#x27;s 130th Airlift Wing (130 AW), an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained unit of the West Virginia Air National Guard.

The airport sits on a hilltop over 300 feet (about 100 m) above the valleys of the Elk and Kanawha Rivers, and the hill drops off sharply on all sides. Arriving passengers enjoy a view of downtown Charleston or the rolling hills north and east of the field.

Federal Aviation Administration records show 225,150 passenger enplanements in calendar year 2015, a decrease of 6.8% from the 241,566 enplanements in 2014. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.

==Facilities==
West Virginia International Yeager Airport covers at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one asphalt runway, 5/23, .

Runway 5/23&#x27;s heading is 235°. An Engineered Materials Arresting System (EMAS) was built at the end of Runway 5 to act as an equivalent to a 1,000 ft. runway safety area, as required by the FAA. Yeager&#x27;s secondary runway 15/33, now taxiway C, was headed 335° and was long. It was mostly used by general aviation.

In the year ending November 30, 2022 the airport had 38,083 aircraft operations, an average of 104 per day: 63% general aviation, 13% air taxi, 15% military, and 9% airline. In November 2022, 66 aircraft were based at this airport: 31 single-engine, 6 multi-engine, 4 jet, 17 helicopter, and 8 military.

In 2021 the Marshall University&#x27;s Bill Noe Flight School was founded at the West Virginia Yeager International Airport. The school, named after the former COO of NetJets, Bill Noe, features a 12,000 sq ft. academic building, a hangar, and an aircraft parking apron.

==History==
During World War II, Charleston&#x27;s airport, Wertz Field, closed when the airport&#x27;s approaches were blocked by the federal government building a synthetic rubber plant next to the airport. There were already plans for a new Charleston airport.

The city started construction in 1944; the airport opened in 1947 as Kanawha Airport and American Airlines flights started in December. A terminal was built in 1950, designed by Tucker &amp; Silling. In 1985 the airport was named for then-Brigadier General Chuck Yeager, a native of nearby Lincoln County who piloted the world&#x27;s first supersonic flight in the Bell X-1. In 1986 the terminal was renovated. Concourse C, designed by L. Robert Kimball and Associates and costing $2.8 million, was completed in 2001.

On February 27, 2008, CRW&#x27;s Governing Board voted to close the secondary runway, Rwy 15/33, to allow construction of two new hangars and ramp space for four more C-130s to be based at the Air National Guard facility. It will allow the airport to triple the general aviation area&#x27;s hangar space and create room for off-runway businesses, and provide parking for up to ten additional commercial airliners. $5 million was given to the airport to build a canopy around the front of the terminal. An additional $2 million was given for a covered walkway from the terminal to the parking garage.

On June 25, 2009, AirTran Airways began service from Charleston to Orlando. AirTran was the first low-cost airline at CRW since Independence Air left years before. AirTran used the Boeing 717-200 until June 3, 2012, when AirTran&#x27;s last flight departed from CRW.
On March 3, 2011, Spirit Airlines began flights to Fort Lauderdale and on May 5, 2011, Spirit started seasonal flights between Charleston and Myrtle Beach. On June 10, 2012, Spirit ended service to Fort Lauderdale, leaving seasonal service to Myrtle Beach.

People Express Airlines planned service to Orlando International Airport, on a similar schedule to AirTran&#x27;s former operations at CRW, but filed for bankruptcy before starting.

On July 27, 2021, the airport board members voted to change the name of the airport to West Virginia International Yeager Airport following the completion of the U.S. Customs Building by the general aviation area of the airport.

On March 2, 2023, it was reported that Spirit Airlines would end service to the airport on May 4, 2023. Later in March 2023, it was reported that Breeze Airways would begin low-cost, non-stop flight service to Orlando, Florida and Charleston, South Carolina, with additional flights to New York City and the West Coast beginning over the next two years.

===Accidents and incidents===
On May 12, 1959, Capital Airlines Flight 983, a Lockheed L-049 Constellation touched down and landed and the captain groundlooped the aircraft due to ineffective braking. During the maneuver the Constellation skidded down a steep embankment and caught fire. One crewmember and one passenger died out of 44 on board.

On August 10, 1968, Piedmont Airlines Flight 230 was on an ILS localizer-only approach to runway 23 when it struck trees 360 feet from the runway threshold. The aircraft continued and struck up-sloping terrain short of the runway in a nose-down attitude. The aircraft continued up the hill and onto the airport, coming to rest 6 feet beyond the threshold and 50 feet from the right edge of the runway. A layer of dense fog was obscuring the runway threshold and about half of the approach lights. Visual conditions existed outside the fog area. All three crew members and 32 of the 34 passengers died. The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the accident on an &quot;unrecognized loss of altitude orientation during the final portion of an approach into shallow, dense fog.&quot; The disorientation was caused by a rapid reduction in the ground guidance segment available to the pilot at a point beyond which a go-around could be successfully effected.

On July 13, 2009, Southwest Airlines Flight 2294 from Nashville International Airport to Baltimore-Washington International Airport was forced to divert to West Virginia International Yeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia after a hole formed on the top of the plane&#x27;s fuselage near the tail, resulting in depressurization of the cabin and deployment of the oxygen masks. The Boeing 737-3H4 with 133 passengers and crew landed safely.

On January 19, 2010, PSA Airlines Canadair CRJ-200 N246PS on Flight 2495 to Charlotte, North Carolina on behalf of US Airways with 30 passengers and three crew, overran the runway following a rejected take-off at 16:13 local time (21:13 UTC). The aircraft was stopped by the EMAS at the end of the runway, sustaining substantial damage to its undercarriage.

On February 8, 2010, a Freedom Airlines Embraer ERJ-145 on Flight 6121 to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport on behalf of Delta Air Lines with 46 passengers and three crew, rejected takeoff from Charleston at high speed and came to a safe stop about short of the runway end. Both right main gear tires exploded and the fragments damaged the flaps.

On March 13, 2015, a landslide below the approach to Runway 5/23 caused damage to an overrun area, although operations at the airport were largely unaffected by the damage.

On May 5, 2017, an Air Cargo Carriers Short 330, subcontracted by UPS and operating as Air Cargo Carriers Flight 1260, crashed after suffering a hard landing at CRW. Both the captain and first officer were killed in the accident. Early reports state that the left-wing made contact with the surface of Runway 5, separated from the fuselage, and the aircraft cartwheeled left off the runway and down a heavily wooded hillside. The National Transportation Safety Board cited in its final report the causes of &quot;the flight crew&#x27;s improper decision to conduct a circling approach contrary to the operator&#x27;s standard operating procedures (SOP) and the captain&#x27;s excessive descent rate and maneuvering during the approach, which led to inadvertent, uncontrolled contact with the ground. Contributing to the accident was the operator&#x27;s lack of a formal safety and oversight program to assess hazards and compliance with SOPs and to monitor pilots with previous performance issues.&quot;

<doc id="294579" wikidata="Q1163183" url="?curid=294579" title="Charleston International Airport">
<text>Charleston International Airport is a joint civil-military airport located in North Charleston, South Carolina, United States. The airport is operated by the Charleston County Aviation Authority under a joint-use agreement with Joint Base Charleston. It is South Carolina&#x27;s busiest airport; in 2023 the airport served over 6.1 million passengers in its busiest year on record. The airport is located in North Charleston and is approximately northwest of downtown Charleston. The airport serves as a focus city for Breeze Airways. It is also home to the Boeing facility that assembles the 787 Dreamliner.

==History==
In 1928, the Charleston Airport Corporation was founded and purchased of land previously belonging to a mining company. Although privately developed at first, the City of Charleston floated bonds in 1931 to acquire a portion of the site for passenger service. Within ten years, three runways were paved and outfitted with lighting for nighttime operations. In World War II, control of the airfield passed to the United States Army though civilian service was allowed to continue to use the airfield. After the war, the airfield reverted to civilian use for a short time. In 1949, a new passenger terminal was built.

During the Korean War, the airfield was reactivated for military use and in 1952, the City of Charleston and the United States Air Force reached an agreement on control of the base and the runways—an arrangement that has been renegotiated over time and that continues to this day. In 1979, the civilian portions of the airport were transferred from the City of Charleston to the Charleston County Aviation Authority, which had operated two other airports in the area. The current terminal on the south end of the airport was built in the 1980s on land acquired by Georgia Pacific.

In October 2009, Boeing announced that it would build a major plant on at the airport as a second final assembly site for its 787 Dreamliner commercial aircraft. The facility began limited operations in July 2011 and rolled out its first completed aircraft in April 2012. Additional facilities to complement aircraft assembly have since been announced by the company.

Since 2010, the airport&#x27;s passenger figures have doubled. New services established by additional airlines during this time along with increased services from the three legacy carriers have contributed to this growth. 

In 2021, the newly established Breeze Airways announced that the airport would serve as a focus city for the airline and announced service to 11 cities. In 2022, the airport authority announced a 20-year master plan for future growth of the airport, including the constructing of an additional concourse, adding up to 11 new gates, providing additional plane stands, and expanding parking facilities for vehicles.

The airport has had brief periods of international service. In 2001, Air Canada briefly served the airport from Toronto but ended service immediately after the September 11th attacks in 2001. Porter Airlines briefly served Charleston with flights to Toronto in 2015. In April 2019, British Airways launched a seasonal route to London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport. This was Charleston&#x27;s first transatlantic flight. The first season ended in October. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the service was suspended in 2020. In 2023, Air Canada announced a return to Charleston with daily nonstop flights to Toronto starting in March 2024.

==Facilities==

The airport consists of four general areas: the military area to the west, the airline terminal to the south, the general aviation area to the east, and the Boeing assembly area further to the south. The combined airport area of Charleston International Airport and Charleston Air Force Base covers and has two runways: 15/33, and 03/21, .

For the 12-month period ending May 31, 2019, the airport had 118,211 aircraft operations, an average of 324 per day: 42% commercial, 28% general aviation, 16% military, and 13% air taxi. In May 2019, there were 81 aircraft based at this airport: 28 single-engine, 6 multi-engine, 43 jet, and 4 helicopter.

Joint Base Charleston owns and operates the runways at the airport and has an agreement with the Charleston County Aviation Authority to allow civilian use of the field. General aviation services are operated by the Charleston County Aviation Authority. Boeing South Carolina operates the Boeing assembly area.

===Terminal===
The current airline terminal completed a three-year, $200 million redevelopment project in 2016 which added five gates and significantly renovated the interior appearance of the facility. The original terminal was built in 1985 and was designed by Howard Needles Tammen &amp; Bergendoff, Davis &amp; Floyd, Inc., and Lucas &amp; Stubbs.

Both departures and arrivals are located on the same floor, with the departure area to the east end of the terminal and the arrival area to the west end. Flights depart from two concourses: Concourse A towards the east and Concourse B towards the west. Since 2015, a consolidated TSA security checkpoint is utilized for both concourses. Charleston International Airport is classified as a security-level Category I airport by the TSA. The airport is equipped to handle international flights.

Concourse A contains eight gates (A1, A2, A2A, and A3-A7) that are primarily used by Delta Air Lines and Delta Connection, with other airlines occasionally using gates as needed for overflow.

<doc id="294582" wikidata="Q2633124" url="?curid=294582" title="Muslim period in the Indian subcontinent">
<text>The Muslim period in the Indian subcontinent or Indo-Muslim period is conventionally said to have started in 712, after the conquest of Sindh and Multan by the Umayyad Caliphate under the military command of Muhammad ibn al-Qasim. It began in the Indian subcontinent in the course of a gradual conquest. The perfunctory rule by the Ghaznavids in Punjab was followed by Ghurids, and Sultan Muhammad of Ghor (r. 1173–1206) is generally credited with laying the foundation of Muslim rule in Northern India.

From the late 12th century onwards, Muslim empires dominated the subcontinent, most notably the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire. Various other Muslim kingdoms ruled most of South Asia from the mid-14th to late 18th centuries, including the Bahmani, Bengal, Gujarat, Malwa, Kashmir, Multan, Mysore, Carnatic and Deccan Sultanates. Though the Muslim dynasties in India were diverse in origin, they were linked together by the Persianate culture and Islam.

The height of Islamic rule was marked during the reign of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707), during which the Fatawa Alamgiri was compiled, which briefly served as the legal system of Mughal Empire. Additional Islamic policies were re-introduced in South India by Mysore&#x27;s de facto king Tipu Sultan. 

Sharia was used as the primary basis for the legal system in the Delhi Sultanate, most notably during the rule of Firuz Shah Tughlaq and Alauddin Khilji, who repelled the Mongol invasions of India. On the other hand, rulers such as Akbar adopted a secular legal system and enforced religious neutrality. Muslim rule in India saw a major shift in the cultural, linguistic, and religious makeup of the subcontinent. Persian and Arabic vocabulary began to enter local languages, giving way to modern Punjabi, Bengali, and Gujarati, while creating new languages including Hindustani and its dialect, Deccani, used as official languages under Muslim dynasties. This period also saw the birth of Hindustani music, Qawwali. Religions such as Sikhism and Din-e-Ilahi were born out of a fusion of Hindu and Muslim religious traditions as well.

In the 18th century the Islamic influence in India begin to decline following the decline of the Mughal Empire, resulting in former Mughal territory conquered rival powers such as the Maratha Confederacy. However, Islamic rule would still remain under regional Nawabs and Sultans. 

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, large parts of India were colonized by the East India Company, eventually establishing the British Raj in 1857. Regional Islamic rule would remain under princely states, such as Hyderabad State, Junagadh State, and other minor princely states until the mid of the 20th century. 

Today, Bangladesh, Maldives and Pakistan are the Muslim majority nations in the Indian subcontinent while India has the largest Muslim minority population in the world numbering over 204 million.

==History==

===Early Muslim dominions===

Local kings who converted to Islam existed in places such as the Western Coastal Plains as early as the 7th century. Islamic rule in India prior to the advent of the Mamluk dynasty (Delhi) included those of Arab Caliphate, Ghaznavids and Ghurids.

===Delhi Sultanate===

The Delhi Sultanate was the first of the two major Islamic empires which was based in mainland India between 1206 and 1526. It emerged after the disintegration of the Ghurid empire in 1206. During the last quarter of the 12th century, Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Indo-Gangetic plain, conquering in succession Ghazni, Multan, Lahore, and Delhi. Qutb-ud-din Aybak, one of his generals proclaimed himself Sultan of Delhi. In Bengal and Bihar, the reign of general Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji was established. Shamsuddīn Iltutmish (1211–1236), established the Delhi Sultanate on a firm basis, which enabled future sultans to push in every direction. Within the next 100 years, the Delhi Sultanate extended its way east to Bengal and south to the Deccan. The sultanate was in constant flux as five dynasties rose and fell: the Mamluk dynasty (1206–90), Khalji dynasty (1290–1320), Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1413), Sayyid dynasty (1414–51), and Lodi dynasty (1451–1526). Power in Delhi was often gained by violence—nineteen of the thirty-five sultans were assassinated—and was legitimized by reward for tribal loyalty. Factional rivalries and court intrigues were as numerous as they were treacherous; territories controlled by the sultan expanded and shrank depending on his personality and fortunes.

The Delhi sultanate peaked under Muhammad bin Tughlaq in 1335. However, it came under gradual decline afterwards, with kingdoms like the Bengal Sultanate, Madurai Sultanate, Khandesh Sultanate and Bahmani Sultanate all asserting independence. Timur&#x27;s invasion in 1398 only accelerated the process, and the Gujarat Sultanate and Jaunpur Sultanate broke away. Some of these kingdoms, such as Jaunpur, were again brought back under the Delhi Sultanate&#x27;s control, although the rest remained independent from central rule until the conquests of the Mughal Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Both the Qur&#x27;an and sharia (Islamic law) provided the basis for enforcing Islamic administration over the independent Hindu rulers. According to Angus Maddison, between the years 1000 and 1500, India&#x27;s GDP, of which the sultanates represented a significant part, grew by nearly 80%, to $60.5 billion; however, this growth was lower than India’s GDP growth during the prior 1,000 years. Additionally, Maddison estimates that India’s population grew by nearly 50% during the same period. The Delhi Sultanate period coincided with a greater use of mechanical technology in the Indian subcontinent. While India previously already had sophisticated agriculture, food crops, textiles, medicine, minerals, and metals, it was not as sophisticated as the Islamic world or China in terms of mechanical technology. Sultan &#x27;Ala ud-Din made an attempt to reassess, systematize, and unify land revenues and urban taxes and to institute a highly centralized system of administration over his realm, but his efforts were abortive. Although agriculture in North India improved as a result of new canal construction and irrigation methods, including what came to be known as the Persian wheel, prolonged political instability and parasitic methods of tax collection brutalized the peasantry. Yet trade and a market economy, encouraged by the free-spending habits of the aristocracy, acquired new impetus both in India and overseas. Experts in metalwork, stonework and textile manufacture responded to the new patronage with enthusiasm. In this period Persian language and many Persian cultural aspects became dominant in the centers of power, as the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate had been thoroughly Persianized since the era of the Ghaznavids. 

===Mughal Empire===

The Mughal empire was the second &amp; last major Islamic empire to assert dominance over most of the Indian subcontinent between 1526 and 1857. The empire was founded by the Turco-Mongol leader Babur in 1526, when he defeated Ibrahim Lodi, the last ruler of the Delhi Sultanate at the First Battle of Panipat. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb are known as the six great Mughal Emperors. Apart from the brief interruption of 16 Years by the Afghan Sur Empire between 1540 and 1556, the Mughals continued to rule in one form or other till 1857.

India was producing 24.5% of the world&#x27;s manufacturing output up until 1750. Mughal economy has been described as a form of proto-industrialization, like that of 18th-century Western Europe prior to the Industrial Revolution.

After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the empire declined and reduced subsequently to the region in and around Old Delhi by 1757 to 1760. The decline of the Mughals in the 18th century provided opportunity for the Nawabs of Oudh and Bengal as well as Nizam of Hyderabad to become independent. The empire was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

===Western and central India===
Sultan Alauddin Khalji (r.1296–1316) carried out extensive conquests in the western India. He invaded the kingdoms of Gujarat (raided in 1299 and annexed in 1304), Jaisalmer (1299), Ranthambore (1301), Chittor (1303), Malwa (1305), Siwana (1308), and Jalore (1311). These victories ended several Rajput and other Hindu dynasties, including the Paramaras, the Vaghelas, the Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura and Jalore, the Rawal branch of the Guhilas, and possibly the Yajvapalas; and permanently establishing Muslim rule in the regions of central and western India. After his death, independent Islamic kingdoms emerged there.
====Gujarat Sultanate====

The Gujarat Sultanate was founded by Sultan Zafar Khan Muzaffar, whose ancestors were Tāṅks from southern Punjab. Earlier, he was the governor of Gujarat appointed by the Tughlaq Sultans of Delhi. However, in the aftermath of the destruction of Delhi by Emir Timur, he declared independence in 1407. The next sultan, his grandson Ahmad Shah I moved the capital to Ahmedabad in 1411. His successor Muhammad Shah II subdued most Rajput chieftains. The prosperity of the sultanate reached its zenith during the rule of Mahmud Begada. He also subdued most Gujarati Rajput chieftains and built a navy off the coast of Diu. In 1509, the Portuguese empire wrested Diu from the Sultanate in the battle of Diu (1509). The Moghul emperor Humayun attacked Gujarat in 1535 and briefly occupied it, during which Bombay, Bassein &amp; Damaon would become a Portuguese colony, thereafter Bahadur Shah was killed by the Portuguese while making a deal in 1537. The end of the sultanate came in 1573, when Akbar annexed Sultanate of Guzerat into his empire. The kingdom was primarily based in the present-day state of Gujarat, India. 
====Malwa Sultanate====

The Malwa Sultanate was another Muslim kingdom in the Malwa region, covering the present day Indian states of Madhya Pradesh and south-eastern Rajasthan from 1392 to 1562. It was founded by Dilawar Khan, who following Timur&#x27;s invasion and the disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate, in 1401/2, made Malwa an independent realm. In 1561, the Sultanate was conquered by the Mughal empire from its last ruler, Baz Bahadur.

====Other Western states ====
Sindh was ruled by a series of Muslim dynasties including Habbaris, Soomras, Sammas, Arghuns and Tarkhans, after the disintegration of Arab caliphate. Following decline of Mughal empire, Kalhora and Talpur Nawabs ruled Sindh. Kingdom of Mewat was also a prominent Muslim Rajput kingdom in Rajasthan. Gonds of Deogarh was also a Gond/tribal Islamic kingdom located in Nagpur, Maharashtra.

===North India===

====Bengal Sultanate====
In 1339, the Bengal region became independent from the Delhi Sultanate and consisted of numerous Islamic city-states. The Bengal Sultanate was formed in 1352 after Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, ruler of Satgaon, defeated Alauddin Ali Shah of Lakhnauti and Ikhtiyaruddin Ghazi Shah of Sonargaon; ultimately unifying Bengal into one single independent Sultanate. At its greatest extent, the Bengal Sultanate&#x27;s realm and protectorates stretched from Jaunpur in the west, Tripura and Arakan in the east, Kamrup and Kamata in the north and Puri in the south.

Although a Sunni Muslim monarchy ruled by Turco-Persians, Bengalis, Habshis and Pashtuns, they still employed many non-Muslims in the administration and promoted a form of religious pluralism. It was known as one of the major trading nations of the medieval world, attracting immigrants and traders from different parts of the world. Bengali ships and merchants traded across the region, including in Malacca, China, Africa, Europe and the Maldives through maritime links and overland trade routes. Contemporary European and Chinese visitors described Bengal as the &quot;richest country to trade with&quot; due to the abundance of goods in Bengal. In 1500, the royal capital of Gaur was the fifth-most populous city in the world with 200,000 residents.

Persian was used as a diplomatic and commercial language. Arabic was the liturgical language of the clergy, and the Bengali language became a court language. The patronage of the sultans raised Bengali from the language of the masses. Sultan Ghiyathuddin Azam Shah sponsored the construction of madrasas in Makkah and Madinah. The schools became known as the Ghiyasia Banjalia Madrasas. Taqi al-Din al-Fasi, a contemporary Arab scholar, was a teacher at the madrasa in Makkah. The madrasa in Madinah was built at a place called Husn al-Atiq near the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque. Several other Bengali Sultans also sponsored madrasas in the Hejaz.

The Karrani dynasty was the last ruling dynasty of the sultanate. The Mughals became determined to bring an end to the independent kingdom. Mughal rule formally began with the Battle of Rajmahal in 1576, when the last Sultan Daud Khan Karrani was defeated by the forces of Emperor Akbar, and the establishment of the Bengal Subah. The eastern deltaic Bhati region remained outside of Mughal control until being absorbed in the early 17th century. The delta was controlled by a confederation of aristocrats of the Sultanate, who became known as the Baro-Bhuiyans. The Mughal government eventually suppressed the remnants of the Sultanate and brought all of Bengal under full Mughal control.

====Jaunpur Sultanate====
The Jaunpur Sultanate was founded in 1394 by Khwajah-i-Jahan Malik Sarwar, a eunuch slave and former wazir of Sultan Nasiruddin Muhammad Shah IV Tughluq, amidst the disintegration of the Delhi Sultanate&#x27;s Tughlaq dynasty. It was centred in Jaunpur, and the Sultanate extended authority over Awadh and a large part of the Ganges-Yamuna Doab between 1394 and 1479. It reached its greatest height under the rule of Sultan Ibrahim Shah, who also vastly contributed to the development of Islamic education in the Sultanate. In 1479, Sultan Hussain Khan was defeated by the forces of Bahlul Lodi, Sultan of the Lodi dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate, which abruptly brought an end to independent Jaunpur and its reabsorption into the Delhi Sultanate.

====Nawabs of Bengal====
Nawab was a title given by the Mughals to the governors of different provinces. During disintegration of the empire in the 18th century, many Nawabs became de facto independent.

In the early 18th-century, the Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad were the &quot;de facto&quot; independent ruler of the three regions of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa which constitute the modern-day sovereign country of Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. The Nawabs of Bengal oversaw a period of proto-industrialization. The region was a major production center for cotton muslin cloth, silk cloth, shipbuilding, gunpowder, saltpetre, and metalworks. The British company eventually challenged the authority of the Nawabs. In the aftermath of the siege of Calcutta in 1756, in which the Nawab&#x27;s forces overran the main British base, the East India Company dispatched a fleet led by Robert Clive who defeated the last independent Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah at the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Mir Jafar was installed as the puppet Nawab. His successor Mir Qasim attempted in vain to dislodge the British. The defeat of Nawab Mir Qasim of Bengal, Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula of Oudh, and Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II at the Battle of Buxar in 1764 paved the way for British expansion across India.

====Nawabs of Awadh====
Nawab of Awadh ruled major parts of present-day Uttar Pradesh. The Nawabs of Awadh, along with many other Nawabs, were regarded as members of the nobility of the greater Mughal Empire. They joined Ahmad Shah Durrani during the Third Battle of Panipat (1761) and restored Shah Alam II ( and 1788–1806) to the imperial throne. The Nawab of Awadh also fought the Battle of Buxar (1764) preserving the interests of the Moghul. Oudh State eventually declared itself independent from the rule of the &quot;Great Moghul&quot; in 1818.

Oudh joined other Indian states in an upheaval against British rule in 1858 during one of the last series of actions in the Indian rebellion of 1857. In the course of this uprising detachments of the British Indian Army from the Bombay Presidency overcame the disunited collection of Indian states in a single rapid campaign. Determined rebels continued to wage sporadic guerrilla clashes until the spring of 1859. This rebellion is also historically known as the &quot;Oudh campaign&quot;.

====Other Northern states====
In northern India, the Multan-based Langah Sultanate and the Kashmir Sultanate were established during the 14th century. Nobles in the court of the Delhi Sultanate founded other Islamic dynasties elsewhere in India including Khandesh Sultanate. The Kingdom of Rohilkhand was also a major power in northern India in the 18th century.

===South India===
Till the early 14th century, south India was ruled by Hindu dynasties. During the reign of Sultan Alauddin Khalji (r.1296–1316), his slave-general Malik Kafur led multiple campaigns to the south of the Vindhyas, obtaining a considerable amount of wealth from Devagiri (1308), Warangal (1310) and Dwarasamudra (1311). These victories forced the Yadava king Ramachandra, the Kakatiya king Prataparudra, and the Hoysala king Ballala III to become Alauddin&#x27;s tributaries. In 1321, Muhammad bin Tughluq was sent by his father to the Deccan Plateau to fight a military campaign against the Kakatiya dynasty. In 1323, the future sultan successfully laid siege upon the Kakatiya capital in Warangal. This victory over King Prataparudra ended the Kakatiya dynasty. Although the control of Delhi sultanate was weakened after 1335 in the south, its successor Muslim states continued to rule Deccan plateau for next several centuries.
====Bahmani Sultanate====
The Muhammad bin Tughlaq&#x27;s failure to hold securely the Deccan and South India resulted in the rise of competing for Southern dynasties: the Muslim Bahmani Sultanate (1347–1518) and the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire (1336–1646). Zafar Khan, a former provincial governor under the Tughluqs, revolted against Delhi Sultans and proclaimed himself sultan, taking the title Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah in 1347. It was the first Muslim empire located in the Deccan region. Bahmani empire was known for its perpetual wars with its rival Vijayanagara, which would outlast the Sultanate. The Bahmani Sultans were patrons of the Persian language, culture and literature, and some members of the dynasty became well-versed in that language and composed its literature in that language. The Bahmani Sultanate adopted the patterns established by the Delhi overlords in tax collection and administration, but its downfall was caused in large measure by the competition and hatred between Deccani (domiciled Muslim immigrants and local converts) and paradesi (foreigners or officials in temporary service). The Bahmani Sultanate initiated a process of cultural synthesis visible in Hyderabad where cultural flowering is still expressed in vigorous schools of Deccani architecture and painting. The later rulers are buried in an elaborate tomb complex, known as the Bahmani Tombs. The exterior of one of the tombs is decorated with coloured tiles. Arabic, Persian and Urdu inscriptions are inscribed inside the tombs.

====Deccan sultanates====
The Bahmani Sultanate lasted for almost two centuries, until it fragmented into five smaller states, known as the Deccan sultanates (Bijapur, Golconda, Ahmednagar, Berar, and Bidar) in 1527. Although the five sultanates were all ruled by Muslims, their founders were of diverse, and often originally non-Muslim origins: the Ahmadnagar Sultanate was of Hindu-Brahmin origins; the Berar sultanate by a Kannadiga Hindu convert; the Bidar Sultanate was founded by a Georgian slave; the Bijapur Sultanate was founded by a Georgian slave purchased by Mahmud Gawan and the Golconda Sultanate was of Turkmen origin.

The rulers of the Deccan sultanates made a number of cultural contributions in the fields of literature, art, architecture, and music. An important contribution was the development of the Dakhani language, which, having started development under the Bahamani rulers, developed into an independent spoken and literary language during this period by continuously borrowing from Arabic-Persian, Marathi, Kannada, and Telugu. Dakhani later became known as Dakhani Urdu to distinguish it from North Indian Urdu. Deccani miniature painting—which flourished in the courts of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, and Golconda—is another major cultural contribution of the Deccan sultanates.

When the rulers of the five Deccan sultanates combined their forces and attacked the Vijayanagara empire in 1565, the empire crumbled at the Battle of Talikot.

====Nizams of Hyderabad====

Nizam, a shortened version of Nizam-ul-Mulk, meaning &quot;Administrator of the Realm&quot;, was the title of the native sovereigns of Hyderabad state, India, since 1719, belonging to the Asaf Jahi dynasty. The dynasty was founded by Mir Qamar-ud-Din Siddiqi, a viceroy of the Deccan under the Mughal emperors from 1713 to 1721 who intermittently ruled under the title &quot;Asaf Jah&quot; in 1924. After Aurangzeb&#x27;s death in 1707, the Mughal Empire crumbled, and the viceroy in Hyderabad, the young Asaf Jah, declared..himself independent.The dynasty ruled for 7 generations, with the last Nizam – Mir Osman Ali Khan showing an enormous contributions on the field of education, construction of major public buildings across the kingdom, setting up of Nizam&#x27;s Guaranteed State Railway(NSGR), donations to Universities, temples and donating of land from his personal estate to Vinobha Bhave&#x27;s Bhoodan movement.

====Mysore Kingdom====

Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan held power and were de facto rulers of the proto-industrialised Mysore Sultanate during the latter part of the 18th century. They made alliances with France and fought the Anglo-Mysore Wars predominantly against the British.

====Carnatic Sultanate====
The Carnatic Sultanate was a kingdom in South India between about 1690 and 1855, and was under the legal purview of the Nizam of Hyderabad, until their demise. The Nawabs of Carnatic eventually ceded tax rights to the British in 1801 following Carnatic wars, and the kingdom was abolished.

====Other Southern states====
Other southern states include the Arakkal Kingdom (of modern-day Kerala) who were a subordinate of their masters the Kolathiris and the short-lived Madurai Sultanate which was centered in and around Madurai and existed for barely 40 years.

<text>Edmonton International Airport , officially branded YEG Edmonton International Airport since 2022, is the primary air passenger and air cargo facility in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region of the Canadian province of Alberta. Designated as an international airport by Transport Canada and operated by Edmonton Airports, it is located south of Downtown Edmonton in Leduc County on Highway 2 opposite of the city of Leduc. The airport offers scheduled non-stop flights to major cities in Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and Europe.

It is a hub facility for Northern Alberta and Northern Canada. The airport has a catchment area encompassing Central and Northern Alberta, northern British Columbia, and Yukon, the Northwest Territories and western Nunavut. The total catchment area is 1.8 million residents. It is Canada&#x27;s largest major airport by total land area, covering just under , the 5th busiest airport by passenger traffic and 9th busiest by aircraft movements. It served 7,919,690 passengers in 2024. The airport serves as headquarters for two major Canadian airlines, passenger carrier Flair Airlines and cargo carrier Morningstar Air Express.

==History==

Transport Canada selected the current site for Edmonton International Airport, on the opposite side of the city from the military airport at RCAF Station Namao, and purchased over of land. When the airport opened on November 15, 1960, its first terminal was an arch hangar. Today, it is in use by Summit Air. In 1963, a passenger terminal, built in the international style, was opened. It remains in use as the North Terminal. Artwork, fired by Alberta natural gas, adorned the departures area exterior. A large mural, commissioned by the Canadian government in 1963 for $18,000 titled &quot;Bush Pilot in Northern Sky&quot; by Jack Shadbolt, remains to this day. An appraisal in 2005 indicated that the mural was worth $750,000, and a restoration of the mural was undertaken in 2007.

During the 1970s, the airport experienced rapid growth in traffic as the city of Edmonton grew, and served approximately 2 million passengers by 1980. However, from the early 1980s until 1995, traffic declined. This decline was attributed to the continued usage of Edmonton City Centre Airport as well as to a slowing economy. Edmonton City Centre did not have the facilities to accept large wide-bodied, long-haul aircraft. Thus airlines used City Centre to fly short-haul flights to hubs in other cities where connections to many locations were available.

Growth returned in 1995. In the 1995 Edmonton municipal election, 77% of voters approved by plebiscite to consolidate all scheduled jet passenger service at Edmonton International Airport.

In 1998, the airport began the $282 million &quot;1998–2005 Redevelopment Project&quot;. The three-phase project included the construction of the south terminal and central hall concept, a commuter facility, doubling of the apron, and a multistorey parkade. This redevelopment project expanded the passenger capacity to 5.5 million.

By the time the expansion project was completed in 2005, continued passenger growth triggered planning for another expansion. A new control and office tower was added in 2009.
Further expansions completed in 2013 including seven new passenger gates, 14 boarding bridges, moving walkways, and advanced baggage handling and scanning systems. A new Renaissance Hotel was another major addition to the airport landscape.

The airport played a major role during the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, operating as hubs for aerial firefighting and medical evacuation. The airport became a way-station and temporary shelter for thousands of Fort McMurray evacuees. The Emergency Operations Centre in the airport ran for 112 hours, organizing the arrival and departure of hundreds of aircraft. During May 2016, the airport saw more than 300 additional daily flights on top of their regularly scheduled service.

In August 2016, the Government of Alberta announced $90 million in funding to begin twinning Highway 19 and that it has protected the area needed for a third runway, which is required due its estimated length and orientation as runway 11/29, causing it to exceed current airport boundaries. The airport also plans to extend runway 12/30 by one-third its current length from to increase accessibility and capacity tied to Port Alberta Developments/Intercontinental routes.

===Historical international airline service===
The airport had international service soon after it opened. In 1960, Canadian Pacific Airlines was operating nonstop flights to Amsterdam with Bristol Britannia turboprop aircraft several times a week. By 1961, Canadian Pacific had introduced Douglas DC-8 jetliners on its nonstop service to Amsterdam. Also in 1961, US-based Northwest Airlines was operating daily Douglas DC-7C propliner service on a routing of Edmonton–Winnipeg–Minneapolis/St. Paul–Milwaukee–New York City Idlewild Airport (now JFK Airport). In 1962, Trans-Canada Airlines (TCA, now Air Canada) operated direct flights to London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport once a week via a stop in Winnipeg and also to Paris Orly Airport three times a week via stops in Toronto and Montreal with DC-8 jets. 

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Pacific Western Airlines operated Boeing 707 charter flights from the airport to the UK and other destinations in Europe. In 1970, Air Canada operated nonstop DC-8 service to London-Heathrow twice a week while CP Air flew nonstop DC-8 service to Amsterdam three times a week. CP Air then introduced Boeing 747 jumbo jet service nonstop to Amsterdam with two flights a week being operated in 1976. By 1978, the airline was also flying nonstop 747 service to Honolulu. Air Canada had also begun daily nonstop Boeing 727-200 service to both Los Angeles and San Francisco by 1979 and was operating direct one stop McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 service to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport via Winnipeg by 1985. Earlier, in 1983, both airlines were operating wide body jetliners on their respective services to Europe with Air Canada flying Lockheed L-1011 TriStar long range series 500 model aircraft three days a week nonstop to London Heathrow while CP Air was flying 747s three days a week nonstop to Amsterdam. 

Wardair Canada also operated scheduled and charter flights to Europe as well as charter service to Hawaii from the airport and in 1979 was operating nonstop charter service to London Gatwick Airport and Prestwick in the UK as well as to Amsterdam and Frankfurt. In 1989, Wardair Canada was operating scheduled nonstop service to London Gatwick and Manchester in the UK and was also operating nonstop charter service at this same time to Frankfurt and Honolulu. The Wardair nonstop service to London Gatwick was being operated with Airbus A310 jets with two flights a week in 1989. LOT Polish Airlines flew to Warsaw, Poland until 2001.

Several US-based air carriers besides Northwest served the airport over the years as well. By 1975, Northwest was operating nonstop Boeing 727-100 jet service to both Anchorage and Minneapolis/St. Paul while Western Airlines was flying Boeing 727-200 and Boeing 737-200 jets direct to Denver, Salt Lake City and Great Falls (with all of these services first stopping in Calgary). Hughes Airwest also served the airport with Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jets on nonstop flights to Spokane as well as direct flights to Las Vegas and Los Angeles. 

By 1980, Hughes Airwest was operating five daily departures from Edmonton with 727-200 and DC-9-30 jetliners with direct service via Calgary to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, San Diego, Phoenix, Tucson, Burbank, Reno, Boise, Spokane and Palm Springs. In 1981, Western Airlines was operating a daily nonstop 727-200 flight to Denver with continuing direct service to Phoenix and Los Angeles while Republic Airlines, which had acquired Hughes Airwest, flew daily nonstop DC-9-10 service to Las Vegas and Spokane. By 1982, Republic Airlines was operating all of its flights to the U.S. from Edmonton via an intermediate stop in Calgary with direct service to Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Spokane and Palm Springs. Also in 1982, Northwest was operating a daily 727-200 flight on a routing of Edmonton–Minneapolis/St. Paul–Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport–Miami–Fort Lauderdale. United Airlines operated a daily 727-100 nonstop flight to San Francisco with direct one-stop service to Los Angeles in 1983. Western Airlines operated a 727-200 nonstop to Salt Lake City in 1987 with this daily flight providing direct one stop service to Los Angeles. Delta Air Lines then acquired and merged with Western with Delta continuing to operate nonstop service to Salt Lake City from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, first with a 727-200 and later with a Boeing 757-200 with these flights providing direct one stop service to Los Angeles as well.

In 1999, Canadian Airlines International flew daily nonstop 737-200 service to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport while Air BC flew nonstop British Aerospace 146 jet service to Denver on behalf of Air Canada on a code sharing basis as an Air Canada Connector air carrier. Also in 1999, Horizon Air began nonstop Fokker F28 Fellowship jet service to Seattle flying on behalf of Alaska Airlines on a code sharing basis. Martinair Holland also operated flights between Edmonton International Airport and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport prior to the termination of this airline&#x27;s passenger service. In 2005, America West Express operated by Mesa Airlines via a code sharing agreement on behalf of America West Airlines was flying nonstop to Los Angeles with Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft.

On November 6, 2020, a Change.org petition was launched by &quot;Western Aviation News&quot; to rename Edmonton International Airport as Edmonton Max Ward International Airport. And an official Canadian House of Commons petition was also launched by Powell on February 2, 2021, and sponsored by Mike Lake, Member of Parliament for Edmonton—Wetaskiwin.

On the morning of August 29, 2022, Edmonton International Airport officially transitioned from EIA to YEG using the YEG acronym from the IATA identifier of the airport as part of the official name.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On January 2, 1973, a Boeing 707-321C CF-PWZ of Pacific Western Airlines, on a cargo flight carrying 86 cattle from Toronto, Ontario with five crew-members on board, was on approach to runway 30. Visibility was poor with blowing snow, and turbulence, causing the aircraft to strike the ground short of runway 30. Hitting trees, power-lines and a gravel ridge, the aircraft erupted into fire. All five of the crew-members were killed in the crash along with the cattle, and the aircraft was damaged beyond economic repair. No investigation was conducted, and thus the cause of the crash remains unidentified.
*On November 6, 2014, Air Canada Express Flight JZA8481, a Bombardier DHC-8-402 (registration C-GGBF), on a passenger flight from Calgary to Grande Prairie with 71 passengers and three crew-members, experienced a landing gear tire rupture during takeoff. During take off, the third tire of the main landing gear burst. This caused a loud banging noise that was heard inside the plane. Head winds prevented landing back in Calgary, so it was diverted to Edmonton International Airport. During landing, the right main landing gear collapsed, causing the plane&#x27;s right side propellers to strike the ground and break. One of the blades was ejected through the cabin wall and injured three passengers.

<text>A synthetic language is a language that is statistically characterized by a higher morpheme-to-word ratio. Rule-wise, a synthetic language is characterized by denoting syntactic relationships between words via inflection or agglutination, with fusional languages favoring the former and agglutinative languages the latter subtype of word synthesis. Further divisions include polysynthetic languages (most belonging to an agglutinative-polysynthetic subtype, although Navajo and other Athabaskan languages are often classified as belonging to a fusional subtype) and oligosynthetic languages (only found in constructed languages). In contrast, rule-wise, the analytic languages rely more on auxiliary verbs and word order to denote syntactic relationship between words.

Adding morphemes to a root word is used in inflection to convey a grammatical property of the word, such as denoting a subject or an object. Combining two or more morphemes into one word is used in agglutinating languages, instead. For example, the word &quot;fast&quot;, if inflectionally combined with &quot;-er&quot; to form the word &quot;faster&quot;, remains an adjective, while the word &quot;teach&quot; derivatively combined with &quot;-er&quot; to form the word &quot;teacher&quot; ceases to be a verb. Some linguists consider relational morphology to be a type of derivational morphology, which may complicate the classification.

==Forms of synthesis==
Derivational and relational morphology represent opposite ends of a spectrum; that is, a single word in a given language may exhibit varying degrees of both of them simultaneously. Similarly, some words may have derivational morphology while others have relational morphology.

===Derivational synthesis===
In derivational synthesis, morphemes of different types (nouns, verbs, affixes, etc.) are joined to create new words. That is, in general, the morphemes being combined are more concrete units of meaning. The morphemes being synthesized in the following examples either belong to a particular grammatical class – such as adjectives, nouns, or prepositions – or are affixes that usually have a single form and meaning:

* German

::* This word demonstrates the hierarchical construction of synthetically derived words:
:::# &quot;members of [the] supervisory board&quot; + &quot;meeting&quot;
:::## &quot;supervisory board&quot; + &quot;s&quot; (&quot;Fugen-s&quot;) + &quot;members&quot;
:::### &quot;supervision&quot; + &quot;s&quot; + &quot;council, board&quot;
:::#### &quot;on, up&quot; + &quot;sight&quot;
:::### &quot;member&quot; + plural
:::#### &quot;co-&quot; + &quot;element, constituent part&quot;
:::## (a verb prefix of variable meaning) + &quot;to gather&quot; + present participle
:::*, , , , and are all bound morphemes.
* Greek

* Polish

* English

:* English word chains such as &quot;child labour law&quot; may count as well, because it is merely an orthographic convention to write them as isolated words. Grammatically and phonetically they behave like one word (stress on the first syllable, plural morpheme at the end).
* Russian

* Persian

* Ukrainian

* international classical compounds based on Greek and Latin

:::* alternately, cholesterol can be read as + () + , as in &quot;bile + solid + [alcohol suffix]&quot;, or &quot;the solid alcohol present in bile&quot;.

===Relational synthesis===
In relational synthesis, root words are joined to bound morphemes to show grammatical function. In other words, it involves the combination of more abstract units of meaning than derivational synthesis. In the following examples many of the morphemes are related to voice (e.g. passive voice), whether a word is in the subject or object of the sentence, possession, plurality, or other abstract distinctions in a language:

* Italian

* Spanish

* Catalan

* Nahuatl

* Latin

* Albanian
***&quot;give + to me + it[singular] + you[plural] + [imperative mood]&quot;
***&#x27;You, give it to me&#x27;
* Japanese

* Finnish

* Hungarian
* Turkish

* Georgian
==Types of synthetic languages==

===Agglutinating languages===

Agglutinating languages have a high rate of agglutination in their words and sentences, meaning that the morphological construction of words consists of distinct morphemes that usually carry a single unique meaning. These morphemes tend to look the same no matter what word they are in, so it is easy to separate a word into its individual morphemes. Morphemes may be bound (that is, they must be attached to a word to have meaning, like affixes) or free (they can stand alone and still have meaning).

*Swahili is an agglutinating language. For example, distinct morphemes are used in the conjugation of verbs:
**Ni-na-soma: I-present-read or I am reading
**U-na-soma: you-present-read or you are reading
**A-na-soma: s/he-present-read or s/he is reading

===Fusional languages===

Fusional languages are similar to agglutinating languages in that they involve the combination of many distinct morphemes. However, morphemes in fusional languages are often assigned several different lexical meanings, and they tend to be fused together so that it is difficult to separate individual morphemes from one another.

===Polysynthetic===

Polysynthetic languages are considered the most synthetic of the three types because they combine multiple stems as well as other morphemes into a single continuous word. These languages often turn nouns into verbs. Many Native Alaskan and other Native American languages are polysynthetic.

*Mohawk: Washakotya&#x27;tawitsherahetkvhta&#x27;se means &quot;He ruined her dress&quot; (strictly, &#x27;He made the-thing-that-one-puts-on-one&#x27;s body ugly for her&#x27;). This one inflected verb in a polysynthetic language expresses an idea that can only be conveyed using multiple words in a more analytic language such as English.

===Oligosynthetic===
Oligosynthetic languages are a theoretical notion created by Benjamin Whorf. Such languages would be functionally synthetic, but make use of a very limited array of morphemes (perhaps just a few hundred). The concept of an oligosynthetic language type was proposed by Whorf to describe the Native American language Nahuatl, although he did not further pursue this idea. Though no natural language uses this process, it has found its use in the world of constructed languages, in auxlangs such as Ygyde and aUI.

==Synthetic and analytic languages==
Synthetic languages combine (&quot;synthesize&quot;) multiple concepts into each word. Analytic languages break up (&quot;analyze&quot;) concepts into separate words. These classifications comprise two ends of a spectrum along which different languages can be classified. The present-day English is seen as analytic, but it used to be fusional. Certain synthetic qualities (as in the inflection of verbs to show tense) were retained.

The distinction is, therefore, a matter of degree. The most analytic languages, isolating languages, consistently have one morpheme per word, while at the other extreme, in polysynthetic languages such as some Native American languages a single inflected verb may contain as much information as an entire English sentence.

In order to demonstrate the nature of the isolating-analytic–synthetic–polysynthetic classification as a &quot;continuum&quot;, some examples are shown below.

===Isolating===

* Mandarin lacks inflectional morphology almost entirely, and most words consist of either one- or two-syllable morphemes, especially due to the very numerous compound words.

However, with rare exceptions, each syllable in Mandarin (corresponding to a single written character) represents a morpheme with an identifiable meaning, even if many of such morphemes are bound. This gives rise to the common misconception that Chinese consists exclusively of &quot;words of one syllable&quot;. As the sentence above illustrates, however, even simple Chinese words such as &quot;míngtiān&quot; &#x27;tomorrow&#x27; (&quot;míng&quot; &quot;next&quot; + &quot;tīan&quot; &quot;day&quot;) and &quot;péngyou&quot; &#x27;friend&#x27; (a compound of &quot;péng&quot; and &quot;yǒu&quot;, both of which mean &#x27;friend&#x27;) are synthetic compound words.

The Chinese language of the classic works (of Confucius for example) and southern dialects to a certain extent is more strictly monosyllabic: each character represents one word. The evolution of modern Mandarin Chinese was accompanied by a reduction in the total number of phonemes. Words which previously were phonetically distinct became homophones. Many disyllabic words in modern Mandarin are the result of joining two related words (such as péngyou, literally &quot;friend-friend&quot;) in order to resolve the phonetic ambiguity. A similar process is observed in some English dialects. For instance, in the Southern dialects of American English, it is not unusual for the short vowel sounds and to be indistinguishable before nasal consonants: thus the words &quot;pen&quot; and &quot;pin&quot; are homophones (see pin-pen merger). In these dialects, the ambiguity is often resolved by using the compounds &quot;ink-pen&quot; and &quot;stick-pin&quot;, in order to clarify which &quot;p*n&quot; is being discussed.

===Analytic===
* English:
**&quot;He travelled by hovercraft on the sea&quot; is largely isolating, but &quot;travelled&quot; (although it is possible to say &quot;did travel&quot; instead) and &quot;hovercraft&quot; each have two morphemes per word, the former being an example of relational synthesis (inflection), and the latter of compounding synthesis (a special case of derivation with another free morpheme instead of a bound one).

===Rather synthetic===
* Japanese:
** means strictly literally, &#x27;To us, these photos of a child crying are things that are difficult to be shown&#x27;, meaning &quot;We cannot bear being shown these photos of a child crying&quot; in more idiomatic English. In the example, most words have more than one morpheme and some have up to five.
*Hebrew:
** . this sentence means &quot;Yesterday I told my friends about the idea I was thinking about&quot;. From this example we can see that Hebrew verbs are conjugated by tense/mood and person (including gender and number). In addition, there are prepositions that are also conjugated, but by person, like and . More at: Modern Hebrew grammar.

*Bulgarian:
**Селото, селото, пустото селото откак заселено. . this sentence means &quot;That village, that particular village, that village has always been empty ever since it was settled&quot;. From this example we can see that Bulgarian nouns are inflected by definiteness, gender, number. Bulgarian verbs are conjugated by tense, mood, person, gender, number, and evidential marking. Bulgarian is a fusional inflecting language with some analyticity (including prepositions in the nominal morphology, and some analytical-synthetic tenses in the verbal morphology).

The definite articles are not only suffixes but are also noun inflections expressing thought in a synthetic manner.

===Very synthetic===
* Finnish: 
**&quot;Käyttäytyessään tottelemattomasti oppilas saa jälki-istuntoa&quot; 
**&quot;Should they behave in an insubordinate manner, the student will get detention.&quot; 
**Structurally: behaviour (present/future tense) (of their) obey (without) (in the manner/style) studying (they who (should be)) gets detention (some). Practically every word is derived and/or inflected. However, this is quite formal language, and (especially in speech) would have various words replaced by more analytic structures: &quot;Kun oppilas käyttäytyy tottelemattomasti, hän saa jälki-istuntoa&quot; meaning &#x27;When the student behaves in an insubordinate manner, they will get detention&#x27;.
* Georgian: 
** &quot;gadmogvakht&#x27;unebinebdneno&quot; (&quot;gadmo-gv-a-kht&#x27;un-eb-in-eb-d-nen-o&quot;) 
**&quot;They said that they would be forced by them (the others) to make someone to jump over in this direction&quot;. 
**The word describes the whole sentence that incorporates tense, subject, direct and indirect objects, their plurality, relation between them, direction of the action, conditional and causative markers, etc.
* Classical Arabic: 
**&quot;And did we give it (masc.) to you futilely?&quot; in Arabic, each word consists of one root that has a basic meaning (&#x27;  &#x27;give&#x27; and &#x27;  &#x27;futile&#x27;). Prefixes and suffixes are added to make the word incorporate subject, direct and indirect objects, number, gender, definiteness, etc.

==Increase in analyticity==
Haspelmath and Michaelis observed that analyticity is increasing in a number of European languages. In the German example, the first phrase makes use of inflection, but the second phrase uses a preposition. The development of preposition suggests the moving from synthetic to analytic.


It has been argued that analytic grammatical structures are easier for adults learning a foreign language. Consequently, a larger proportion of non-native speakers learning a language over the course of its historical development may lead to a simpler morphology, as the preferences of adult learners get passed on to second generation native speakers. This is especially noticeable in the grammar of creole languages. A 2010 paper in &quot;PLOS ONE&quot; suggests that evidence for this hypothesis can be seen in correlations between morphological complexity and factors such as the number of speakers of a language, geographic spread, and the degree of inter-linguistic contact.

According to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, Modern Hebrew (which he calls &quot;Israeli&quot;) &quot;is much more analytic, both with nouns and verbs&quot;, compared with Classical Hebrew (which he calls &quot;Hebrew&quot;).
