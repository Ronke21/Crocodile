<text>Michael John McCarthy (born November 10, 1963) is an American professional football coach who most recently was the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL) from 2020 to 2024. From 2006 to 2018, he was the head coach of the Green Bay Packers. In 2011, McCarthy led the team to a win in Super Bowl XLV over his hometown team, the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was also the offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers and New Orleans Saints.

During his 17 seasons as a head coach in the NFL, McCarthy has an overall regular season record of 169–104–2. He is among only five head coaches (Tom Landry, Chuck Noll, Andy Reid, and Bill Belichick) to lead one franchise to eight straight playoff appearances. McCarthy is second to Curly Lambeau in all-time wins leading the Packers.

==Early life ==
McCarthy was born and raised in Pittsburgh, in the blue-collar neighborhood of Greenfield. His mother, Ellen McCarthy, was a secretary who also worked in restaurants and for the Peace &amp; Justice Center. His father, Joe McCarthy Jr., was a firefighter for the Pittsburgh Fire Bureau and an officer for the Pittsburgh Police. He also owned a bar called Joe McCarthy&#x27;s Bar and Grill, which Mike spent his Sundays cleaning before church. McCarthy was raised as a Pittsburgh Steelers fan.

McCarthy is one of five siblings. He has three sisters, Colleen, Ellen, and Kellie, and a brother, Joseph III (d. 2015). McCarthy attended St. Rosalia primary school, where he played basketball. He later made annual donations to the school. McCarthy attended Bishop Boyle High School.

=== Playing career and education===
After high school, McCarthy initially went to Salem University (then Salem College) in West Virginia before returning home to work in his father&#x27;s bar. In 1984, McCarthy attended Scottsdale Community College in Arizona, playing one season for the Fighting Artichokes football team. He then transferred to Baker University, an NAIA school located in Baldwin City, Kansas. McCarthy was a two-time all-conference tight end. In 1986 McCarthy was captain of the team, which finished the season as the national runner-up in NAIA Division II.

In 1987, McCarthy earned a B.S. in business administration.

==Coaching career==
===College===
In 1987, Duane Dirk, the defensive coordinator at Fort Hays State University in Kansas, hired McCarthy as a defensive graduate assistant (GA). Over the next two years, McCarthy focused on linebackers and defensive ends. During his time as the defensive graduate assistant, McCarthy pursued a master of science degree; he graduated with a M.S. in Sports Administration in 1989.

After serving as a graduate assistant at Fort Hays State from 1987 to 1988, McCarthy returned home to Pittsburgh. On July 30, 1989, McCarthy contacted Mike Gottfried, the head coach at the University of Pittsburgh, looking for a coaching job, but no positions were available. McCarthy was told to mail his resume. McCarthy later showed up at Gottfried&#x27;s office without an appointment to introduce himself. Two days later, one of Gottfried&#x27;s assistants resigned, and McCarthy was offered a volunteer coach position without pay. McCarthy later worked under coach Paul Hackett.

McCarthy served as a graduate assistant for three seasons before coaching wide receivers during the 1992 season. Initially, he also worked the night shift on the Pennsylvania Turnpike as a toll collector during the off-season to supplement his income. McCarthy stated that he spent his time in the tollbooth reviewing the University of Pittsburgh playbook.

===Kansas City Chiefs ===
In 1993, McCarthy and Paul Hackett left Pittsburgh and were hired by the Kansas City Chiefs under head coach Marty Schottenheimer. McCarthy worked two years as an offensive quality control assistant. As Head Coach of the Green Bay Packers, McCarthy hired six former quality control coaches to serve as his position coaches. In 1993 and 1994, McCarthy worked with Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana.

In 1995, McCarthy became quarterbacks coach for the Chiefs, overseeing Rich Gannon, Elvis Grbac, and Steve Bono. McCarthy&#x27;s signal callers threw 52 interceptions — the lowest in the American Football Conference (AFC) during the years from 1995 through 1998.

=== Green Bay Packers ===
When Schottenheimer resigned from the Chiefs after the 1998 season, McCarthy left Kansas City and became the Packers&#x27; quarterbacks coach. There, he worked with Hall of Famer Brett Favre. In the 1999 season, while working with McCarthy, Packers quarterback Brett Favre threw for 4,091 yards, the fourth-best total of his career. While McCarthy was quarterbacks coach, the 1999 Packers team was ranked seventh in passing and ninth in overall offense in the league.

=== New Orleans Saints ===
In 2000, McCarthy was hired as the offensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints. That year, the Saints achieved a 10–6 regular season record, then won their first playoff game in the franchise&#x27;s history and finished 10th overall in offense. McCarthy was selected as National Football Conference (NFC) Assistant Coach of the Year by USA Today in 2000.

The Saints failed to make the playoffs over the next three years. In 2002, the Saints led the NFC in scoring with 49 touchdowns and 432 points, but slowed down at the end of the season. In 2003, the Saints scored 340 points—their eighth highest-scoring season ever. All of McCarthy&#x27;s four years with the Saints rank in the team&#x27;s top 10 years for offense.

While McCarthy was with the team, the Saints’ offense set 25 individual and 10 team records. Joe Horn caught 45 touchdowns and 437 passes for 6,289 yards. During McCarthy&#x27;s time with the team, running backs Ricky Williams and Deuce McCallister both had a 1,000-yard season. In his first two years, running back Ricky Williams would run for 2,245 yards with 14 touchdowns. McCarthy stayed with the team for five seasons through 2004.

=== San Francisco 49ers ===
In 2005, McCarthy served as offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers by coach Mike Nolan. His unit had setbacks, including the trade of their most experienced quarterback, Tim Rattay. Rattay was replaced by a rookie quarterback, top draft pick Alex Smith, who was injured in Week 7 of the season.

The 49ers finished the season ranked 30th in the NFL in points scored and dead last in yards gained. Despite this, rookie running back Frank Gore would emerge to run for 608 rushing yards on 127 carries with a 4.8 Yards Per Carry (YPC) while wide receiver Brandon Lloyd had 733 yards receiving and five touchdowns.

===Green Bay Packers===
==== 2006–2009 ====

After Mike Sherman took the Packers to a 4–12 record in 2005, the team released him on January 2, 2006, and immediately started interviewing for a replacement. McCarthy was interviewed by Packers general manager Ted Thompson on January 8, 2006, and was offered the head coaching position three days later.

In 2006, the Packers started with a 4–8 record, but the team still managed to win their last four games after both quarterback Brett Favre and backup quarterback Aaron Rodgers sustained injuries, finishing the season 8–8, and ending with a win against their archrival, the Chicago Bears.

McCarthy guided the Packers to an 8–1 record in the first nine games of the 2007 season, tying Washington&#x27;s Joe Gibbs for the best win–loss ratio to start the first 25 games of a career at 16–9 and passing Vince Lombardi, who went 15–10, for the best coaching start in Packers&#x27; history. The team finished the regular season with a 13–3 record and obtained the number two seed in the NFC playoffs. McCarthy led the Packers to the NFC Championship game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl-winning New York Giants in overtime.

After the 2007 season, McCarthy finished second in voting for The Associated Press Coach of the Year award, garnering 15 votes to Bill Belichick&#x27;s 29 votes.

On January 19, 2008, McCarthy signed a five-year contract extension with the team, which raised his salary to $3.4 million a year. The 2008 season was a tumultuous one. Aaron Rodgers, previously the backup, became the starting quarterback when Brett Favre announced his retirement in March. Favre then changed his mind and sought his previous position as the Green Bay quarterback. The organization reiterated its intent to move forward with Rodgers as the new face of the Packers, although Favre was offered the backup position behind Rodgers. Favre refused the offer, and was traded to the New York Jets in exchange for a conditional fourth-round draft pick.

The 2008 season started with a 5–5 record, followed by five consecutive losses. The season ended with a 31–21 victory over the Detroit Lions, bringing the Packers&#x27; regular season record to 6–10. The Packers finished third in the NFC North, ahead of only the Lions, and did not make the playoffs. Under McCarthy, Aaron Rodgers threw for over 4,000 yards and posted a 93.8 passer rating.

Rodgers improved on his 2008 statistics in 2009, but was sacked 50 times, more than any other quarterback in the NFL. The Packers dominated teams with losing records but were swept by their rival Minnesota Vikings, led by former Packers franchise quarterback Brett Favre. The Packers lost to the previously winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but then came back to beat the NFC East-leading Dallas Cowboys. They then went on a five-game winning streak and qualified for the playoffs with a Week 17 victory over the Arizona Cardinals, finishing with an 11–5 record.

This was the second playoff berth in McCarthy&#x27;s tenure. The Packers lost the wild-card round to the Cardinals in overtime, 51–45.

==== 2010 ====
In 2010, the Packers had 25 players on the injured reserve list throughout the season. Running back Ryan Grant sustained an injury in week one that sidelined him for the rest of the season. McCarthy nonetheless led the Packers to a 10–6 regular season finish, never losing by more than four points and never trailing by more than 7 throughout the entire season. This record earned them second place in the NFC North, behind the Chicago Bears, with whom they split victories in the regular season.

They went into the NFC playoffs as the sixth seed. The Packers defeated the number three-seeded Philadelphia Eagles by a 21–16 score in the wild-card round. They then played the number one-seeded Atlanta Falcons, beating them by a convincing margin of 48–21.

The Packers then played the second-seeded Chicago Bears for the third time that season in the NFC Championship Game. They won 21–14 and advanced to Super Bowl XLV. After this game, McCarthy&#x27;s team had a 3–0 postseason record on the road.

===== Super Bowl XLV =====
Super Bowl XLV pitted the Packers against the Pittsburgh Steelers. This was the first time these two storied franchises had played each other in the postseason. Ahead of the game, confident in his team&#x27;s performance, McCarthy had the team fitted for Super Bowl championship rings.

The Packers defeated the Steelers 31–25 to win their fourth Super Bowl and 13th NFL title overall. The win returned the Lombardi Trophy to Green Bay for the first time since the team&#x27;s 1996 season.

==== 2011–2017 ====

The 2011 Packers team was a record-setting one, leading the NFL in points scored and setting a franchise record for wins at 15–1 and consecutive wins. McCarthy&#x27;s offensive strategies facilitated Aaron Rodgers&#x27; NFL MVP season, as he threw for 4,643 yards and 45 touchdowns, throwing most often to receiver Jordy Nelson.

The Packers&#x27; season ended in the NFC Divisional Round against the New York Giants. The team had suffered a number of setbacks, including the season-ending neck injury of defensive back Nick Collins, and appeared to have suffered, rather than benefited, from the time off, dropping nine passes in this game. Eli Manning of the Giants attacked the Packers’ weaker defense (ranked 19th in scoring defense) and the Packers lost 37–20.

In 2012, the Packers finished with an 11–5 record that ranked them first in the NFC North Division, the first time the Packers had won two consecutive NFC North titles since the three they won from 2002 to 2004. McCarthy&#x27;s offensive strategies led to the Packers scoring 433 points, with Aaron Rodgers passing for 4,295 yards. The 2012 postseason was the 28th time the franchise had secured a playoff berth. After beating the Minnesota Vikings in the first round they lost to the San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional Round by a score of 45–31.

In 2013, McCarthy led the Packers to a regular season record of 8–7–1 and the NFC North title, the third consecutive division win. That year, McCarthy took his team to their fifth straight playoff appearance. During the summer of 2014, the village board of Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin voted to rename Potts Avenue “Mike McCarthy Way.”

In 2014, McCarthy guided the Packers to their fourth consecutive NFC North title with a 12–4 record. The team ranked sixth in the NFL in total offense, with an average of 386 yards per game, and first in points scored, with an average of 30.4 points per game. In receiving yards, Jordy Nelson led the team with 1,519 yards. Aaron Rodgers threw for 4,381 yards and Eddie Lacy had 1,139 rushing yards.

In November 2014, McCarthy signed a contract extension through 2018. With a Week 16 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, McCarthy notched his 99th win, passing Hall of Famer Vince Lombardi (98) for second on the Packers&#x27; all-time wins list, behind only Hall of Famer Curly Lambeau (212).

The Packers defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, but in the NFC Championship Game against the Seattle Seahawks, the Packers collapsed. Despite holding a 16–0 lead at halftime and a 19–7 lead in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, going on to lose the game 22–28 in overtime. McCarthy was criticized after making several questionable play calls during this loss. At the start of the game, he went for two field goals at the 1 yard line, and was criticized for &quot;not going for it&quot;. During the last five minutes of the game, McCarthy called three run plays to Eddie Lacy with 3:52 minutes left, and the Packers punted on fourth down; critics slammed McCarthy for &quot;not giving Aaron Rodgers a chance&quot; to win the game. A day after the loss, McCarthy stated that he is &quot;not questioning his play-calling&quot;, as well as stating that he &quot;came to run the ball&quot;. Others defended McCarthy; in March 2015, at the annual owners&#x27; meetings, Bill Belichick stated that McCarthy is &quot;one of the best coaches I&#x27;ve ever gone up against.&quot; Notwithstanding his rejection of the criticism of his heavily run-dependent strategy McCarthy relinquished play calling duties to long-time assistant Tom Clements in February 2015.

While the Packers made the playoffs for the seventh consecutive time after the 2015 season, the team struggled with a weak running game. In December, McCarthy once again took over play calling responsibilities. After he did so, the Packers recorded a 28–7 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, running the ball for 230 yards.

The 2016 season made McCarthy the fourth head coach in the history of the NFL to take his team to eight-plus consecutive playoff appearances. In the postseason, the Packers won the wild card game against the New York Giants (38–13) and then the NFC Divisional Playoff against the Dallas Cowboys (34–31) before losing on the road to the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game (44–21).

The Packers began the 2017 season with a 4–1 record, but was later hamstrung by a collarbone injury to Rodgers in Week 6 against the Minnesota Vikings. Afterwards, backup quarterback Brett Hundley made his first career start. With only a backup quarterback to work with, McCarthy and the Packers failed to clinch a postseason appearance in 2017, finishing with a 7–9 record.

==== 2018 ====
On January 2, 2018, it was announced that McCarthy had signed a one-year contract extension with the Packers.

On December 2, 2018, after a 20–17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, McCarthy was released after 13 seasons as head coach. He finished his Packers tenure with a regular-season record and a postseason record for a combined record of . McCarthy led the team to nine playoff appearances and a Super Bowl victory.

The timing of the personnel decision caught McCarthy by surprise, as he noted in an interview with ESPN.com. McCarthy said: &quot;Time provides the opportunity for reflection and clarity and that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at now. And it&#x27;s clear to me now that both sides needed a change.&quot;

==== 2019 hiatus ====
After McCarthy was released as Packers head coach, he expressed plans to interview with the New York Jets and Cleveland Browns. The Arizona Cardinals expressed interest, but he declined to proceed with an interview.

McCarthy&#x27;s interview with the Browns was initially scheduled for Thursday, January 3, before being moved to a week later. The Browns offered McCarthy the head coach position, but he declined it, because it would have required him to retain Freddie Kitchens as offensive coordinator. The Browns hired Kitchens instead.

McCarthy interviewed with the Jets on January 5, 2019. The Jets also interviewed Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy and former Miami Dolphins coach Adam Gase. The Jets proceeded to hire Gase.

On January 9, 2019, McCarthy announced that he intended to sit out the 2019 season and return for 2020. McCarthy spent time improving his football knowledge and strategies. In collaboration with fellow coaches such as Jim Haslett, Frank Cignetti Jr. and Scott McCurley, McCarthy studied league playbooks, league trends, and analytics, with the intention of returning to the NFL. He said that his &quot;McCarthy Project&quot; made him &quot;definitely a better coach&quot;.

===Dallas Cowboys===

==== 2020 ====
McCarthy interviewed for the vacant head coach position to replace Jason Garrett, which took place over 12 hours, with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, executive vice president Stephen Jones, and chief sales and marketing officer Jerry Jones Jr. The other person to interview for the position was Marvin Lewis.

On January 7, 2020, McCarthy was announced as the Cowboys&#x27; new head coach. McCarthy, who spent his season off watching game film and learning about analytics with fellow coaches, told Jones during the interview that he watched every play of the 2019 season. During his introductory press conference to announce his hiring, McCarthy said: “I need to confess: I told Jerry I watched every play of the 2019 season. I wanted the job. You do what you gotta do, right?”

McCarthy was the Cowboys&#x27; ninth head coach since the organization was founded in 1960. On September 13, 2020, McCarthy lost his Cowboys head coaching debut against the Los Angeles Rams on the road by a score of 20–17. In the next game, McCarthy received his first win as the Cowboys&#x27; head coach in a narrow 40–39 comeback victory over the Atlanta Falcons.

McCarthy was challenged by the heavy restrictions imposed in the league due to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of physical contact with the players, their availability due to a positive test for the virus or having been exposed to someone who had it, a reduced training camp schedule and the cancellation of the preseason games, which complicated the implementation of the new offensive and defensive schemes. Aggravating the situation was the poor showing of most of the team&#x27;s free agent signings.

The Cowboys finished the season with a 6–10 record, placing third in the NFC East. After losing starting quarterback Dak Prescott to a dislocated ankle in a Week 5 37–34 victory over the New York Giants, the Cowboys still remained in playoff contention in a weak division and with Andy Dalton as the starter at quarterback for most of the season. However, the team struggled defensively, allowing 473 points, which was the Cowboys&#x27; worst-ever defensive showing. After the season, the Cowboys fired defensive coordinator Mike Nolan and defensive line coach Jim Tomsula.

==== 2021 ====

McCarthy was fined $50,000 by the NFL on July 1, 2021, for violating practice rules during organized team activities. As a result of the fine, McCarthy said in a statement the majority of the seven to nine plays the NFL discussed with him involved younger players.

From July through September 2021, McCarthy and the Cowboys were featured on the HBO sports documentary &quot;Hard Knocks&quot;. The experience, which McCarthy called “a good one,” involved a large camera crew filming the entirety of Cowboys training camp.

For the 2021 season, McCarthy guided the team to a 12–5 record and an NFC East division title, including sweeping the entire NFC East for the first time since 1998. After a Week 9 30–16 loss to the Denver Broncos, McCarthy displayed a can of Anti-Monkey Butt powder in a presentation to the team. He informed the Cowboys that although the prior week&#x27;s loss had been a &quot;Red Ass Week,&quot; McCarthy was confident his team would stage a comeback. McCarthy missed the Week 13 27–17 road victory over the New Orleans Saints after testing positive for COVID-19 and was placed in COVID protocols for 10 days. The Cowboys were upset at home 23–17 by the San Francisco 49ers in the playoffs in the wild-card round. The game ended with the clock running out on the Cowboys following a quarterback draw as they attempted to spike the ball to stop the clock to permit a final pass play.

McCarthy was particularly criticized for his decision to use a quarterback draw with 14 seconds left in the fourth quarter, instead of going for two or more passes from further out. McCarthy defended his decision, explaining that he was hoping to get another, easier play in after coming closer to the end zone and that he thought that 14 seconds was sufficient to allow his team to do this.

==== 2022 ====
Before the 2022 season, McCarthy was fined $100,000 by the NFL for violating offseason practice rules. McCarthy canceled a preseason practice instead holding a team bonding golf event.

For the 2022 season, McCarthy led the Cowboys to a 12–5 record, tying the 2021 season record and placing second in the NFC East. During the 19–3 season-opening loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, quarterback Dak Prescott suffered a thumb fracture that required surgery and absence from the team until Week 7. McCarthy replaced him with backup quarterback Cooper Rush who went 4–1 over the next five games. McCarthy dealt with other injuries from key players including safety Jayron Kearse and left tackle Tyron Smith. Before a Week 9 game against the Packers, McCarthy got emotional about a return to Green Bay. He also said he was looking forward to seeing Aaron Rodgers. 

McCarthy led the Cowboys to a 31–14 road victory in the Wild Card Round against the Buccaneers, which was Tom Brady&#x27;s last game of his career and the club&#x27;s first road playoff victory in over 30 years. Playing against the San Francisco 49ers on the road, the Cowboys lost for the second year in a row to their longtime rival by a score of 19–12 and extended the franchise&#x27;s streak to seven straight defeats in the Divisional Round of the playoffs.

==== 2023 ====
In January 2023, McCarthy announced that the Cowboys would be parting ways with offensive coordinator Kellen Moore. He also parted ways with six other coaches. In February 2023, team owner Jerry Jones stated that McCarthy would call plays during the following season. McCarthy new hires included offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer.

The Cowboys overpowered opposing teams with its offense, boasting a top-five rank in total yards and scoring. Prescott flourished and CeeDee Lamb emerged as one of the league&#x27;s best wide receivers. The Cowboys were ranked second heading to the NFC playoffs and faced McCarthy&#x27;s old team the Green Bay Packers at home, but the wild-card matchup against the youngest team in the league ended in embarrassment. Dallas experienced a 27-0 deficit before halftime, before losing in a 48-32 blowout. The result brought forth questions about McCarthy&#x27;s job security, that forced Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to release a statement confirming that he would retain McCarthy as head coach, saying the team is &quot;very close and capable of achieving our ultimate goals.&quot; The Cowboys also became the first team in the Super Bowl era to win 12 games in three straight seasons but not be able to reach a conference title game in that stretch.

==== 2024 ====
McCarthy&#x27;s return set up a difficult dynamic, where he and his entire coaching staff entered the last year of their contracts, without the possibility of an extension. He also was forced to replace defensive coordinator Dan Quinn who took the head coach position with the Washington Commanders with Mike Zimmer. The team lost depth and didn&#x27;t have any important signing in free agency, ending with a roster that wasn&#x27;t set up to succeed, even though Jones used the term &quot;all-in&quot; to describe the Cowboys&#x27; approach in 2024.

The team won their season opener against the Cleveland Browns by a score of 33–17. This win would be seemingly in vain, as they lost three of their next five matchups. These included a 44–19 blowout loss in week 2 to the New Orleans Saints, as well as a 47–9 blowout loss to the Detroit Lions in week 6. After the bye, they would not bounce back, losing four straight. Even worse, in week 9, starting quarterback Dak Prescott tore his hamstring. Playing backups Cooper Rush and Trey Lance, the Cowboys finished 7–10. After the season concluded, it was announced on January 13th, 2025, that McCarthy would no longer be the head coach of the Cowboys.

==Awards==
In 2007, McCarthy was voted the Motorola NFL Coach of the Year after twice receiving Coach of the Week awards. He was also named the NFL Alumni&#x27;s Coach of the Year by a group of former players.

In 2008, McCarthy received the distinguished service award at the Lee Remmel sports awards banquet in Green Bay. McCarthy was selected as National Football Conference (NFC) Assistant Coach of the Year by USA Today in 2000.

==Personal life==
In 1995, McCarthy and his high school sweetheart, Christine, amicably divorced. On March 15, 2008, McCarthy married Jessica Kress. They have five children between them; two sons from Jessica&#x27;s previous marriage, a daughter from McCarthy&#x27;s previous marriage and two daughters together.

McCarthy and his wife Jessica have a history of giving back to communities and people in need. The couple were involved with the Seven Loaves Project in Rwanda. They founded the McCarthy Family Foundation, a charitable nonprofit. The McCarthy Family Foundation has donated frequently to the American Family Children&#x27;s Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. McCarthy hosts an annual golf tournament to benefit the hospital, and his foundation&#x27;s fundraising was integral for the building of the hospital&#x27;s Surgical Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The Foundation has donated to the MVP Foundation which brings together combat veterans and former professional athletes as they transition to a new life off the field.

The foundation has also donated $100,000 (which the Green Bay Packers matched) to the Green Bay Police Foundation. The funds were used to purchase protective equipment for police officers in the area. The money was also spent on outreach programs intended to build community relations, and on bias prevention training for the officers.

On February 26, 2019, McCarthy was accused of berating three high school basketball referees after his stepson&#x27;s playoff game. McCarthy went on a &quot;verbal tirade&quot; while following the officials to their locker room. McCarthy apologized to the school&#x27;s athletic department the next day.

McCarthy is a culinary enthusiast and has a history of supporting local restaurants and chefs throughout his coaching career. In 2013, McCarthy partnered with Curly&#x27;s Pub at Lambeau Field (now 1919 Kitchen &amp; Tap) to create the &quot;Mac Attack&quot; burger. Ten percent of the proceeds from all the sales of McCarthy&#x27;s burger went to his philanthropic organization, the McCarthy Family Foundation.

<doc id="306663" wikidata="Q921388" url="?curid=306663" title="Nimzo-Indian Defence">
<text>The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:
:1. 
:2. 
:3. 

Other move orders, such as 1.c4 e6 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.d4 Bb4, are also feasible. In the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot;, the Nimzo-Indian is classified as E20–E59.

This hypermodern opening was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. Unlike most Indian openings, the Nimzo-Indian does not involve an immediate fianchetto, although Black often follows up with ...b6 and ...Bb7. By pinning White&#x27;s knight, Black prevents the threatened 4.e4 and seeks to inflict doubled pawns on White. White will attempt to create a and develop their pieces to prepare for an assault on the Black position.

Black&#x27;s delay in committing to a pawn structure makes the Nimzo-Indian (sometimes colloquially referred to as the &quot;Nimzo&quot;) a very flexible defence to 1.d4. It can also transpose into lines of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit or Queen&#x27;s Indian Defence. The Nimzo-Indian is a highly respected defence to 1.d4, is played at all levels and has been played by every world champion since Capablanca. White often plays 3.g3 or 3.Nf3 to avoid the Nimzo-Indian, allowing them to meet 3.Nf3 Bb4+ (the Bogo-Indian Defence) with 4.Bd2 or 4.Nbd2, rather than 4.Nc3.
==General considerations==

In the Nimzo-Indian, Black is generally prepared to concede the bishop pair by playing Bxc3. As dynamic compensation, they often double White&#x27;s c-pawns, which represent a static weakness, and gains play against the central light squares d5 and e4, even in those instances where White is able to recapture with a piece after ...Bxc3. By pinning the knight to the king, black indirectly controls the center by preventing the move e4. Black will aim to close the position to reduce the scope of White&#x27;s bishops. To this end, Black must blockade the white pawn centre from advancing and neutralise White&#x27;s attacking chances on the . An example of Black&#x27;s strategy carried out successfully is the game Mikhail Botvinnik–Samuel Reshevsky from the 1948 World Chess Championship, which reached the position in the diagram after White&#x27;s 24th move.

Earlier in the game, Reshevsky was able to block White&#x27;s kingside attack by playing ...Nf6–e8 and ...f7–f5. Now, both White&#x27;s bishops are reduced to defence, and White&#x27;s queen is reduced to passivity at the a2-square to defend the pawns on a3 and c4. Without prospects for counterplay, White&#x27;s game is strategically hopeless, and Black ultimately exchanged queens and won the endgame.

==Rubinstein System: 4.e3 ==

The Rubinstein System (named after Akiba Rubinstein) is White&#x27;s most common method of combating the Nimzo-Indian. Svetozar Gligorić and Lajos Portisch made great contributions to the theory and practice of this line at top level during their careers. White continues their development before committing to a definite plan of action. In reply, Black has three main moves to choose from: 4...0-0, 4...c5, and 4...b6.

In addition, Black sometimes plays 4...d5 or 4...Nc6. The move 4...d5 can transpose to lines arising from 4...0-0, but White has the extra option of 5.a3 (known as the Botvinnik Variation). This forces Black to retreat the bishop to e7 or capture on c3, which transposes to a line of the Sämisch Variation long considered good for White because they will undouble their pawns at some point by playing cxd5, eliminating the weak pawn on c4, then prepare the e4 pawn break, backed by the bishop pair (and in some cases with f3, since they haven&#x27;t committed the knight to that square yet), which will gain force in the more open type of position which will ensue. 4...Nc6 is the Taimanov Variation, named after Russian GM Mark Taimanov. Black prepares to play ...e5, which may be preceded by...d5 and ...dxc4, or ...d6. The variation was tried several times by the young Bobby Fischer, and has long been favoured by GM Nukhim Rashkovsky.
===4...0-0 Main line: 4.e3 0-0 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 c5 7.0-0 ===

Black&#x27;s most flexible and frequently played response is 4...0-0. The main line continues 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 c5 7.0-0, reaching the position in the diagram.

White has completed their kingside development, while Black has claimed their share of the centre. At this point, the most important continuations are:

:7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nbd7 (Parma Variation)
:7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 cxd4 9.exd4 b6 (Karpov Variation)
:7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Ba5 (Larsen Variation)
:7...Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Qc7 (Main Variation)
:7...Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3 Qc7 (Khasin Variation)
:7...Nbd7 (Averbakh Variation)

* The Parma Variation (7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nbd7) is named after Slovenian grandmaster (GM) Bruno Parma, and can sometimes transpose to the Karpov Variation if pawns are exchanged on d4. White usually continues with 9.Qe2, clearing the d1-square for the rook, which will assist in the advance of the d-pawn. Black then faces an important decision. They may play 9...b6, with the intention of playing ...cxd4 at some point to isolate the d-pawn and blockade it, or exchange on c3 as well to play against the isolated c3–d4 pawn couple. Or, they can consider 9...a6 to grab space on the with ...b5. In this case, Black will usually retain their .

After 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4, Black also has two rare alternatives on their eighth move worth mentioning: 8...Qe7 intending ...Rd8 is the Smyslov Variation, invented by former world champion Vasily Smyslov, and 8...Bd7 followed by ...Bc6 is the Bronstein Variation, the brainchild of the former world championship finalist David Bronstein.

* The Karpov Variation, (7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 cxd4 9.exd4 b6) named after former World Champion Anatoly Karpov, is one of Black&#x27;s most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. For the moment, White has an isolated pawn in the d-file, even so, Black plans to play ...Bxc3 at some point and follow up with ...Bb7, ...Nbd7, ...R(a)c8 and ...Qc7 to restrain White&#x27;s c- and d-pawns. After 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 cxd4 9.exd4 b6 the game usually continues 10.Bg5 Bb7, when 11.Ne5, 11.Re1, 11.Rc1 and 11.Qe2 are all good moves for White.
* The Larsen Variation (named after GM Bent Larsen) can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Ba5 or 7...Nc6 8.a3 dxc4 9.Bxc4 Ba5, but the latter move order gives White the extra option of 9.axb4. The idea is to wait until White plays dxc5 before playing ...Bxc3. If White does not oblige, then Black will play ...Bb6 with pressure on the d-pawn. The point of inserting ...dxc4 before ...Ba5 is to prevent White from inflicting an isolated queen&#x27;s pawn (IQP) on Black by playing cxd5.
* The Main Variation was enormously popular in the 1950s, but the name has become increasingly inappropriate ever since. This is not because the line is bad for Black – on the contrary, Black equalises in all variations – but because White has a huge selection of moves to choose from, and Black must be familiar with all of them. After 7...Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Qc7, White has tried 11.Be2, 11.Bd3, 11.Ba2, 11.Bb2, 11.Bb5 (trying to provoke ...a6 before retreating the bishop), 11.h3, 11.a4, 11.Re1, 11.Qc2, and 11.Qe2. Regardless of the move chosen, however, the basic strategic ideas remain similar: Black will play a quick ...e5 to pressurize d4. If White has a bishop on d3, then Black also threatens ...e4 forking it and the knight on f3. White will try to advance their centre pawns to free their bishops: c4, d5, and f3 followed by e4 are all possible. If Black can prevent White from achieving this, then they will enjoy the better game. There are several move orders to reach the Main Variation besides the one given above; 4.e3 0-0 5.Bd3 d5 6.a3 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 dxc4 8.Bxc4 c5 9.Nf3 Nc6 10.0-0 is one worth noting, because White may try 9.Ne2 instead.
* 7...Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3 Qc7 is the Khasin Variation, named after International Master Abram Khasin. 10.cxd5 exd5 is the usual continuation. White will try to build up a strong centre with f3 and e4, or they may play for a kingside attack with f3 and g4. Black will try to restrain White&#x27;s centre as well as they can, ideally blockading it, before mobilising their queenside pawn .
* The Averbakh Variation (7...Nbd7) was popularized by GMs Viacheslav Ragozin and Yuri Averbakh. The idea is to exchange pawns on c4 and d4 and then bring the d7-knight to b6 and d5. The same knight may also move to f8 to defend the black king. This line has gone out of fashion since the 1960s due to GM Svetozar Gligorić&#x27;s gambit idea 8.cxd5 exd5 9.a3 Ba5 10.b4 cxb4 11.Nb5! with pressure along the queenside files and a potential square for the knight on d6.

===4...0-0: lines with Ne2===
In general, the main line of the Rubinstein has held up very well for Black, so since the 1980s White has begun to look elsewhere for chances of obtaining an advantage. In the Rubinstein, White has often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight, thus avoiding the doubled pawns. Two lines where White does this (following 4.e3 0-0) are:

:5.Ne2 (Reshevsky Variation)
:5.Bd3 d5 6.Ne2 (Modern Variation)

* The Reshevsky Variation was a specialty of GM Samuel Reshevsky. White will first play a3 to kick the bishop away, before moving their knight on e2 to a more active square. The main line runs 5.Ne2 d5 6.a3 Be7 7.cxd5, when both 7...exd5 and 7...Nxd5 are possible, the latter move leading to livelier play. GM Mikhail Gurevich is currently the foremost expert in the Reshevsky Variation.
* 5.Bd3 d5 6.Ne2 and the closely related variant 5.Bd3 d5 6.cxd5 exd5 7.Ne2 were collectively dubbed the Modern Variation by FM Carsten Hansen in his book on the Rubinstein Nimzo-Indian. White again avoids the doubled pawns, but develops their bishop to d3 first so that it isn&#x27;t blocked in by the knight on e2. Black usually continues 6...c5, putting more pressure on White&#x27;s centre. While 7.a3 and 7.0-0 are playable, the main line is 7.cxd5 cxd4 8.exd4 Nxd5 9.0-0 Nc6, leading to an IQP position with White&#x27;s knight on e2 rather than f3, as is normally the case. This gives Black the possibility of playing ...e5 at some point to completely liquidate the centre, although the resulting positions are rather drawish. White&#x27;s main options on their tenth move are 10.a3, putting the question to the bishop, and 10.Bc2, intending 11.Qd3 with an attack on h7.

===4...c5===

Black puts pressure on d4 and leaves open the option of playing ...d5, or ...d6 and ...e5. The game can still transpose to the main line mentioned above after moves such as 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0, but there are two major variations particular to 4...c5:

* 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3 (6.Ne2 will likely transpose to the Modern Variation) 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 is the Hübner Variation, popularized by GM Robert Hübner in the late 1960s and &#x27;70s and utilised by Bobby Fischer in his world championship match with Boris Spassky in 1972 with great effect in game 5. It is slightly unusual in that Black captures on c3 without waiting for White to play a3, but this is because Black intends to immediately set up a blockade on the dark squares with ...d6 and ...e5. This is feasible because White&#x27;s knight is on f3; if it were on e2 (as in some lines of the Sämisch), White could quickly advance their kingside pawns, but in the current line the knight must be moved away first. By closing the position, Black is able to make their knights superior to White&#x27;s bishops, and the doubled c-pawns deprive White of any pawn breaks on the queenside. It was the success of this variation that motivated the current tendency for White players to choose lines where the doubled pawns are avoided. When they do play into this line, White has two main setups to choose from: they may immediately close the centre by playing 8.e4 e5 9.d5 Ne7, or play more flexibly with 8.0-0 e5 9.Nd2 0-0, but Black has full equality in both lines.
* 5.Ne2 the Rubinstein Variation (this is why 4.e3 is properly referred to as the Rubinstein &quot;system&quot; or &quot;complex&quot; to avoid confusion) is similar in spirit to the Reshevsky Variation: White prevents Black from doubling their pawns. After 5.Ne2, Black opens a path of retreat for their bishop with 5...cxd4 6.exd4, and now chooses between 6...d5 and 6...0-0. 6...d5 allows 7.c5, a typical continuation being 7...Ne4 8.Bd2 Nxd2 9.Qxd2 a5 10.a3 Bxc3 11.Nxc3 a4. White&#x27;s c4–c5 push created a queenside pawn majority, which Black neutralized by playing ...a7–a5–a4. Black will now try to destroy the rest of White&#x27;s pawn formation by playing ...b6 or ...e5, while White will try to use their lead in development to create attacking chances on the kingside. The alternative is 6...0-0 7.a3 Be7. Here Kasparov played 8.d5 exd5 9.cxd5 a few times early in his career, increasing his space advantage further but falling behind in development. A safer move for White is 8.Nf4.

===4...b6===

Favoured by Nimzowitsch, 4...b6 is a move in accordance with the spirit of the Nimzo-Indian: Black fianchettoes their light-squared bishop to increase their control over e4. White usually continues 5.Ne2, avoiding the doubled pawns, or 5.Bd3, continuing their development (5.Nf3 usually transposes to 5.Bd3). The main variations emerging from these moves are:

:5.Ne2 Ba6 (Fischer Variation)
:5.Ne2 c5 (Romanishin–Psakhis Variation)
:5.Ne2 Ne4 (American Variation)
:5.Ne2 Bb7
:5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5 (Classical Fianchetto Variation or Tal Variation)
:5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 c5 (Keres Variation)
:5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 Ne4 (Dutch Variation)

* The Fischer Variation (5.Ne2 Ba6) aims to exchange light-squared bishops after ...d5 so that Black can play on the light squares. Keres, Bronstein and Smyslov were early contributors to the theory of this line, and Fischer used it several times successfully. White may play 6.a3, which was favoured by Botvinnik and asks the bishop on b4 to clarify its intentions, or 6.Ng3, which was invented by Reshevsky and prepares e4.
* 5.Ne2 c5 6.a3 Ba5 was dubbed the Romanishin–Psakhis Variation by Carsten Hansen because Oleg Romanishin and Lev Psakhis were the two grandmasters who were primarily responsible for reviving the line and infusing it with new ideas. It can also arise via the move order 4.e3 c5 5.Ne2 b6 6.a3 Ba5. Black dares White to try and trap the bishop on a5, a challenge White usually takes up, but rarely successfully.
* The American Variation is another name invented by Hansen for the line 5.Ne2 Ne4, as it was pioneered by GM Isaac Kashdan and then developed by GM Bisguier, Anthony Santasiere and currently GM Nick de Firmian. Black will exchange off two minor pieces and play ...f5 to keep e4 under control.
* 5.Ne2 Bb7 is a rather passive line: White seems to obtain a slight advantage by continuing 6.a3 Be7 7.d5, blocking in the bishop on b7 and making e3–e4 possible.
* The Classical Fianchetto Variation, also known as the Tal Variation, can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5 or 4.e3 0-0 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 b6 7.0-0 Bb7. It is a solid variation where White often holds the initiative early on, but Black usually equalises in the end. White has two ways to attack Black&#x27;s setup. The first is to play 8.cxd5 exd5 9.Ne5 followed by 10.f4 and transferring the queen or f1-rook to h3 via f3. This formation, known as the Pillsbury Attack, blocks in the dark-squared bishop and appears rather crude, but is actually quite dangerous. Black must create immediate pressure on White&#x27;s centre by playing ...c5, and ...Ne4 may be a handy move at some point to block the b1–h7 diagonal and perhaps exchange some pieces. The main alternative for White is 8.a3 Bd6 9.cxd5 exd5 10.b4, which gains space on the queenside and makes it harder for Black to free their position with ...c5.
* The Keres Variation, characterised by the moves 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 c5, is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. If allowed, Black will play ...cxd4 and ...d5 in the hope of leaving White with an isolated queen&#x27;s pawn. Nowadays, White&#x27;s most testing continuation is reckoned to be 8.Na4, ducking the exchange on c3 and threatening 9.a3. The knight will often stay on a4 for quite some time to assist in a potential c4–c5 push. After 8...cxd4 9.exd4, Black often sets up a Hedgehog formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6), while White will try to pursue a strategy of gaining queenside space with b4 and c5.
* The Dutch Variation is so-called because after 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 Ne4, Black usually follows up with 7...f5, with a position that resembles the Dutch Defence (1.d4 f5). It is not a very common line, probably because White obtains good chances by playing 7.0-0 f5 8.d5, sacrificing a pawn to open up diagonals for their bishops.

==Classical Variation: 4.Qc2 ==

The Classical or Capablanca Variation was popular in the early days of the Nimzo-Indian, and though eventually superseded by 4.e3 it was revived in the 1990s; it is now just as popular as the Rubinstein. White aims to acquire the two bishops without compromising their pawn structure. The drawback is that the queen will move at least twice within the opening moves and that White&#x27;s kingside development is delayed. Thus, even though White possesses the bishop pair, it is usually advisable for Black to open the game quickly to exploit their lead in development. Black has four common replies to 4.Qc2. These include 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4...d5, and 4...Nc6 (4...d6 intending ...Nbd7 and ...e5 is a rarer fifth option).

* 4...0-0 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 b6 7.Bg5 is nowadays the main line of the Classical Variation (although 6...b5!? is a gambit invented by Alvis Vītoliņš). Black&#x27;s usual choice is 7...Bb7, but 7...Ba6 is also possible to target the c-pawn, and 7...h6 8.Bh4 c5 and 7...c5 are sometimes played as well. After 7...Bb7, White&#x27;s most straightforward move is 8.f3 preparing e4, but Black can counter with 8...h6 9.Bh4 d5, when the pawn grab 10.cxd5 exd5 11.Bxf6 Qxf6 12.Qxc7 Ba6 is very dangerous for White because of Black&#x27;s better development. Therefore, White has sometimes tried 8.e3 instead, when after 8...h6 9.Bh4 d5 10.cxd5 exd5 11.Bxf6 Qxf6 12.Qxc7 Ba6 White has 13.Bxa6 Nxa6 14.Qb7. Thus Black should prefer 8.e3 d6, planning ...Nbd7 and ...c5. &lt;br&gt;Both players can deviate from the main line. Instead of 7.Bg5, White can play 7.Nf3 Bb7 8.e3, intending to develop the dark-squared bishop to b2. Another possibility is 4.Qc2 0-0 5.e4, although this is somewhat inconsistent with 4.Qc2 as Black might be able to double White&#x27;s c-pawns at some point (the queen must guard e4), something 4.Qc2 was supposed to prevent. After 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3, Black can also try 6...Ne4 7.Qc2 f5, which is similar to the Dutch Variation (see 4.e3 b6), but without the doubled pawns for White.
* 4...c5 exploits the fact that on c2, the queen no longer defends the d-pawn. If White defends the pawn, then Black gets an easy game by keeping the pressure on d4, so White almost always plays 5.dxc5. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5 or 5...0-0 6.a3 Bxc5), or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 5...0-0 6.Nf3 Na6). In the former case, the bishop will eventually retreat to e7 and Black will set up a Hedgehog formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6). If Black recaptures with the knight, they will often have to give up the bishop pair at some point with ...Bxc3, but the knight is useful on c5 and can later go to e4, attacking the queen on c3. 4...c5 5.dxc5 0-0 (the Pirc Variation) was one of the reasons why 4.Qc2 was not popular during the mid-20th century, because the lines where Black eventually recaptures with the knight was reckoned to give Black easy equality, while the line which prevented this maneuver, 6.a3 Bxc5 7.Nf3 Nc6 8.Bg5 Nd4 9.Nxd4 Bxd4 10.e3 Qa5 11.exd4 Qxg5, left the Black queen active, while White still needs to secure the king. It was the discovery of 12.Qd2! which revived this line for White, because the endgame after 12...Qxd2+ 13.Kxd2 offers White a slight edge. Indeed, Edmar Mednis&#x27;s remark was that the entire Pirc Variation had become unplayable at the highest level, while &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot; (&quot;MCO&quot;) cites this variation as the main problem with 4...c5. However, players like Kramnik have been willing to defend the Black side of this line against players like Kasparov.
* 4...d5 is another move that strikes immediately in the centre, and was a favourite of Mikhail Botvinnik. After 5.cxd5, Black can either recapture with the queen or pawn. 5...Qxd5 is the Romanishin System named after Oleg Romanishin: the idea is that after 6.Nf3 Qf5 7.Qxf5 exf5, Black strengthens his grip on e4 and makes e6 available for the bishop, which is enough for him to obtain equality. White can avoid this with 6.e3 so that 6...Qf5 can be met with 7.Bd3, but the e3-pawn blocks in White&#x27;s c1-bishop. The older alternative is 5...exd5 6.Bg5 h6, which tends to be a rather sharp line. After 4...d5, White can also play 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 Ne4 7.Qc2, when Black may play 7...c5 or 7...Nc6 intending ...e5. Even though White possesses the pair of bishops, Black still strives for a quick opening of the position to exploit their lead in development. The usual result of this is a dynamically balanced position.
* 4...Nc6 is the Zürich or Milner-Barry Variation (named after British chess player Stuart Milner-Barry). Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. To avoid moving their queen, White will play Bd2 at some point so that when Black takes the knight, White can recapture with the bishop. 4...Nc6 is out of fashion because most players prefer to avoid blocking their c-pawn. A topical line would go 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Qc2 Nc6 5.Nf3 (better than 5.e3) d6, with the idea of playing e5. Black often prepares this with castling and ...Re8 or by playing Qe7. After Black plays ...e5, White usually responds with d5. Black is willing to lose a tempo moving the knight back to b8 (or e7, which is often better) because the position is closed. White usually plays on the queenside in this variation, while Black will try to play on the kingside with ...f5 and possibly transferring the c6-knight over to the kingside after White&#x27;s d5. Today, the line arises quite often by transposition from the Black Knights Tango, e.g. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 Nc6 3.Nf3 e6 4.Nc3 Bb4 5.Qc2.

==Kasparov Variation: 4.Nf3 ==

4.Nf3 is known as the Kasparov Variation, since Garry Kasparov used it to great effect against Anatoly Karpov in their 1985 World Championship match. Kasparov played 4.Nf3 six times, scoring three wins and three draws. Today as White, this is a favourite weapon of GM Alexei Barsov and former Women&#x27;s Champion Nona Gaprindashvili. It is also sometimes known as the purely descriptive Three Knights Variation.

White develops the knight to a natural square and waits to see Black&#x27;s reply. 4...d5 transposes to the Ragozin Defence of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined and 4...b6 5.Bg5 Bb7 transposes to the Nimzo/Queen&#x27;s Indian hybrid line, so 4...c5 is the most common move that stays within Nimzo-Indian territory. Now 5.e3 transposes to the Rubinstein System, but the main move is 5.g3, which leads to a position that also arises from the Fianchetto Variation. 5.g3 cxd4 6.Nxd4 0-0 7.Bg2 d5 8.cxd5 Nxd5 can be considered the main line. Black has dissolved White&#x27;s centre, but the bishop on g2 exerts pressure on the black queenside, which White may augment with 9.Qb3.

This line can also arise from the Bogo-Indian Defence (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Bb4+) if White blocks the check with 4.Nc3.

==Other variations==
*4.f3 – This line has no generally accepted name, so is usually just referred to as the 4.f3 Variation. It has previously been called the Gheorghiu Variation (a name given by Gligorić), named after Florin Gheorghiu who often played it early in his career, even defeating Fischer, sometimes the Shirov Variation, after Alexei Shirov who used it with great success in the early 1990s, before he lost three consecutive games with the line and abandoned it. It&#x27;s also called the Kmoch Variation. It is a straightforward attempt to seize control of e4 at the cost of delaying development. Black&#x27;s most common responses are 4...d5 and 4...c5. After 4...d5, the most common continuation 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 c5 7.cxd5 Nxd5, a position also reached from the Sämisch Variation. Black&#x27;s pressure on c3 and d4 compels White to play 8.dxc5, trying to open the position for their two bishops. White will follow up with e4, and Black will counter with ...e5 at some point to prevent White from pushing their e- and f-pawns further up the board. Another approach for Black is to play 4...c5, after which White&#x27;s most common move is 5.d5 to reach a Benoni-style position, and Black&#x27;s main replies are 5...b5, 5...0-0, 5...Bxc3+ and 5...Nh5. Instead of 5.d5, 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 is a direct transposition to the Sämisch Variation below.
*4.Bg5 – The Leningrad Variation received its name because its theory was developed extensively by players from that city, such as Boris Spassky. Black can play 4...h6 or the immediate 4...c5. After 4...h6, the game may go 5.Bh4 c5 6.d5. Here the main line is 6...d6 7.e3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 e5, when Black has achieved a Hübner Variation-like blockade, the difference being that White&#x27;s dark-squared bishop is outside the pawn chain. The pin on the f6-knight is very annoying, and Black often breaks it by playing the drastic ...g7–g5, which also clamps down on a potential f2–f4 break by White. This move weakens Black&#x27;s kingside, so rather than castle on that side, Black usually safeguards the king by playing ...Kd8-c7. An alternative to 6...d6 or 6...Bxc3+ is 6...b5, much played in the 1970s after Mikhail Tal scored a crushing win over Spassky at Tallinn 1973.
*4.a3 – The Sämisch Variation (named after Fritz Sämisch) is a direct attempt to refute Black&#x27;s strategic concept, as White gives up a tempo and concedes doubled c-pawns to gain the bishop pair. After 4...Bxc3+ 5.bxc3, Black has several possibilities, the most common of which is to blockade the doubled pawns with 5...c5. Black will proceed to attack the pawn on c4 with the moves ...b6, ...Ba6, ...Nc6–a5 and ...Rc8. As compensation, White establishes a powerful centre, which may provide a basis for a quick kingside attack. The Sämisch Variation was employed five times by Mikhail Botvinnik against Tal in the 1960 World Chess Championship, with five draws resulting, and once in the 1961 rematch, with a win for White. Subsequent practice has shown that White ultimately has difficulty obtaining enough kingside play to compensate for the doubled c-pawns, so this variation is rarely seen nowadays. Instead of 5...c5, 5...d5 is also possible, and transposes to the Botvinnik Variation if White plays 6.e3.
*4.g3 – The Romanishin Variation or Fianchetto Variation resembles the Catalan System, where White fianchettoes the king&#x27;s bishop to control the central light squares. Black can play 4...c5 5.Nf3 with a position also reached from the Kasparov Variation (see above), but 4...d5 is possible as well. This is considered the strongest response, since Black can often take and keep the pawn on c4. This is not usually possible in the Catalan, where White&#x27;s queen&#x27;s knight can be developed to d2 rather than c3 and can then recapture on c4.
*4.Qb3 – The Spielmann Variation is named after Rudolf Spielmann who played it at Carlsbad, 1929, and was played at master level in the early 1930s, though soon eclipsed in popularity by 4.Qc2. Like the Classical Variation 4.Qc2, it avoids the doubling of White&#x27;s pawns. Unlike 4.Qc2, the queen on b3 has no control over e4, which Black can exploit, e.g., by playing 4...c5 5.dxc5 Nc6 6.Nf3 Ne4. Thus, despite the occasional revival by GMs Vladimir Akopian, Vladimir Malaniuk and Jeroen Piket, this variation remains uncommon.
*4.Bd2 – This move is relatively unambitious, simply unpinning the knight. The strategic aim of obtaining the without conceding the doubled pawns fails, for after e.g., 4...Bxc3 5.Bxc3 Ne4, White cannot retain both bishops, and trades are usually not in White&#x27;s interest since White has an advantage in . However, it has recently become more popular at the top level as a way to avoid deeply analyzed variations.
*4.Qd3 – The Mikenas Variation is named after Vladas Mikėnas. It supports the knight and brings the queen to a central location, but the queen is exposed on d3, making this variation rare.
*4.e4 – The Dilworth Gambit, named for Vernon Dilworth, who contributed an article on the variation to the March 1949 issue of &quot;CHESS magazine&quot;. Dilworth&#x27;s idea was 4...Nxe4 5.Qg4 Nxc3 6.Bd2, but this does not give White compensation for the pawn. The line accordingly never developed a following beyond Dilworth himself. Chris Ward called the gambit &quot;critical, but basically rubbish&quot;.
*4.Nh3 - This move is very rarely played, and is essentially a waiting move.

<doc id="306672" wikidata="Q1088891" url="?curid=306672" title="Mielikki">
<text>Mielikki () is the Finnish goddess of forests and the hunt. She is referred to in various tales as either the wife or the daughter-in-law of Tapio, and the mother of Nyyrikki and Tuulikki. She is said to have played a central role in the creation of the bear.

In the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Finnish national epic based on Finnish and Karelian folklore, the hero Lemminkäinen offers her and Tapio prayers, gold and silver so he can catch the Hiisi elk. In another passage, Mielikki is asked to protect cattle grazing in the forest. In a country where the forest was central to providing food through hunting, gathering and cattle grazing, it was thought very important to stay on her good side. She is also offered prayers by those who hunt small game and those who gather mushrooms and berries.

Mielikki is known as a skillful healer who heals the paws of animals who have escaped traps, helps chicks that have fallen from their nests and treats the wounds of wood grouses after their mating displays. She knows well the healing herbs and will also help humans if they know well enough to ask her for it. Her name is derived from the old Finnish word &quot;mielu&quot; which means luck.

The Mielikki Mons, a mountain on Venus, is named after her.

<doc id="306673" wikidata="Q2348663" url="?curid=306673" title="Duck Dodgers">
<text>Duck Dodgers is the star of a series of cartoons produced by Warner Bros., featuring Daffy Duck in the role of a science fiction hero.

He first appeared in the 1953 cartoon short &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot;, directed by Chuck Jones as a spoof of the popular &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; science fiction serials of the 1930s, casting the brash, egomaniacal Daffy Duck as the hero of the story. The plot of the cartoon involves Duck Dodgers&#x27; search for the rare element Illudium Phosdex, &quot;the shaving cream atom&quot;, the only remaining supply of which is on the mysterious &quot;Planet X&quot;. Just after Dodgers has claimed Planet X in the name of the Earth, Marvin the Martian lands on the same planet and claims it in the name of Mars. The stage is set for a battle of wits, not to mention various forms of weaponry, most of which tend to backfire comically on Dodgers.

Considering the period in which the cartoon was produced (the Red Scare was in full swing during the 1950s era), some scholars have used the cartoon to parallel the supposed futility of the Cold War and the arms race.

==Duck Dodgers sequels==
The second short, also produced by Chuck Jones and with Mel Blanc reprising his roles, was titled &quot;Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24½th Century&quot; and was released in 1980. The plot of this sequel cartoon was nearly a carbon copy of the original though this time, Marvin says he is trying to solve the Earth&#x27;s energy crisis (by blowing up the Earth); Marvin succeeds in launching his missile and at the end of the cartoon reminds everyone that it&#x27;s only a cartoon.

The third short, titled &quot;Marvin the Martian in the Third Dimension&quot;, was a 3D cartoon released in 1996 to select venues, and had impressionist Joe Alaskey providing Duck Dodgers&#x27; voice. These included the flagship Warner Bros. Studio Store in Manhattan, and Warner Bros. Movie World theme parks on the Gold Coast, Australia and in Bottrop-Kirchhellen, Germany. It included a range of interactive effects including a splash with water. Unlike the other Dodgers cartoons, Porky Pig did not appear.

A fourth short, titled &quot;Superior Duck&quot; was released in 1996, with Frank Gorshin as Duck Dodgers. In this short, the character instead went by the name Superior Duck.

A fifth short, titled &quot;Attack of the Drones&quot;, was made in 2003 and featured Jeff Bennett as the voice of Duck Dodgers. This short was part of a series of new shorts, but because of the failure of &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, it was not released theatrically. However, the short was included as a special feature on disc two of &quot;The Essential Daffy Duck&quot; DVD set.

==Further appearances==
* Duck Dodgers (voiced by Jeff Bergman) also made an appearance in a &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; segment titled &quot;Duck Dodgers Jr.&quot; (in the episode &quot;The Return of the Acme Acres Zone&quot;), where Daffy Duck&#x27;s pint-sized protégé and student Plucky Duck also visited the futuristic world of Duck Dodgers. Here Marvin the Martian appears with his niece, Marcia. Duck Dodgers also makes an appearance in &quot;Star Warners&quot;.
* A SNES and Game Boy game called &quot;Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions&quot; (in which he is voiced by Greg Burson), as well as a Nintendo 64 video game, entitled &quot;Duck Dodgers 64&quot;, have also been produced. He also appeared in the game &quot;Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal&quot;, voiced by Alaskey.
* The original cartoon also appeared in a 1994 episode of the science fiction series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (also produced by WB), where it was revealed that &quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot; was Security Chief Michael Garibaldi&#x27;s &quot;second favorite thing in the universe&quot;. One episode shows Garibaldi laughing uproariously at the cartoon, as Ambassador Delenn watches it with him, appearing totally bewildered.
* Portions of this cartoon can be seen and heard in the background in a scene from the 1977 movie &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;.
* Duck Dodgers, again voiced by Alaskey, appears in the 2003 feature &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; when Daffy notes that the only character that could save the film&#x27;s proverbial day was Duck Dodgers; Daffy then realizes that Dodgers is his alter ego. He ends up defeating Marvin and saving humanity, after several jet packs exploded when he said his name.
* From 2003 to 2005, Cartoon Network aired a &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; TV series. In this show, which had Joe Alaskey returning as the titular character&#x27;s voice, Duck Edgar Dumas Aloysius Eoghain Dodgers started out as a hapless soul that was accidentally frozen for over three hundred years for reasons not known. He was later revived by Dr. I.Q. Hi in the 24½th century. Through scheming and lies he managed to trick everyone into believing he was a 21st-century hero. In reality, he was only a water boy for the Midstate University football team, and &quot;Quarterback Quack&quot; shows that he only carried out this façade at the insistence of a time-traveling Martian Commander X-2, who unwittingly made Dodgers into the hero he was known as. Dodgers is arrogant, selfish, greedy, lazy, cowardly, gullible, and not particularly intelligent. However, he occasionally displays surprisingly high levels of heroism and competence, suggesting that he is not quite as daft as he appears to be, although he mostly succeeds through sheer dumb luck and the work of the Eager Young Space Cadet. Martian Commander X-2 actually caused Dodgers to become a minor football star in the final game of the season, which is what he used to parlay himself into captaincy in the Protectorate, meaning that he is, technically, not lying when he claims he won a championship football game in his own time. It is implied that he can&#x27;t read, though this is contradicted several times. He also has shown to have quite the ego, when he caused the energy core of his ship to explode while using the lasers to carve his name on a nearby planetoid for example, and burning out the auxiliary core to make toast. In &quot;The Green Loontern&quot;, Duck Dodgers accidentally got his costume mixed up with Hal Jordan&#x27;s Green Lantern costume at the dry cleaners where the rest of the Green Lantern Corps mistook him for Hal Jordan. He ended up fighting Sinestro until Hal Jordan arrived and regained his costume to help defeat Sinestro. Though he doesn&#x27;t show it often, Dodgers cares deeply for his Cadet, even though he often demeans and puts him through humiliating situations. In &quot;Of Course You Know, This Means War and Peace&quot; Pt. 1, he is described by Psy Q. Hi as an ego-maniacal, bipolar, narcissist, and pathological liar with sociopathic tendencies.
* Duck Dodgers&#x27; Green Loontern appearance appears as a playable character in the 2014 video game &quot;Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham&quot;. This was also Alaskey&#x27;s final performance as the character before his death in 2016.
* In the &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; episode &quot;Rock On&quot;, Daffy&#x27;s costume is Duck Dodgers. When the other Looney Builders glare at him, he asks &quot;Wrong galaxy?&quot;

==Use by the US Air Force and NASA==
In 2003, both Duck Dodgers and Marvin the Martian were featured on separate 1st Space Launch Squadron mission patches for that year&#x27;s Mars Exploration Rover missions.

==Dragon Con==
The original &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; cartoon is played during the Masquerade contest while the judges make their decisions annually. Dragon Con occurs every Labor Day weekend in Atlanta, Georgia. The tradition was taken on by Dragon Con when Atlanta Fantasy Fair, a preceding Atlanta convention, became defunct.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dragon Con shifted to its first ever virtual convention, Dragon Con Goes Virtual. In keeping with tradition, the Masquerade was held, though in virtual form. A &#x27;sweded&#x27; version was produced by DragonConTV for Dragon Con Goes Virtual and included Kirk R. Thatcher, Neil Grayston, Chris Gauthier, Eddie McClintock, Victor Yerrid, Mark Meer, Raymond Carr, Garrett Wang, K`Tetch, and Bob Bergen.

<text>Jean-Pierre Léaud, ComM (; born 28 May 1944) is a French actor best known for being an important figure of the French New Wave and his portrayal of Antoine Doinel in a series of films by François Truffaut, beginning with &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (1959). He has worked with Jean-Luc Godard, Agnès Varda, and Jacques Rivette, as well as other notable directors such as Jean Cocteau, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Bernardo Bertolucci, Catherine Breillat, Jerzy Skolimowski, and Aki Kaurismäki.

==Early life==

Born in Paris, Léaud made his major debut as an actor at the age of 14 as Antoine Doinel, a semi-autobiographical character based on the life events of French film director François Truffaut, in &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;. To cast the two central characters, Antoine Doinel and his partner-in-crime René Bigey, Truffaut published an announcement in &quot;France-Soir&quot; and auditioned several hundred children in September and October 1958. Jean Domarchi, a critic at &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, had earlier recommended the son of an assistant scriptwriter, Pierre Léaud, and the actress Jacqueline Pierreux. Patrick Auffay was cast as René.

Truffaut was immediately captivated by the fourteen-year-old Léaud, who had already appeared with Jean Marais in Georges Lampin&#x27;s &quot;La Tour, prends garde !&quot; (1958). He recognized traits they both shared, &quot;for example a certain suffering with regard to the family...With, however, this fundamental difference: though we were both rebels, we hadn&#x27;t expressed our rebellion in the same way. I preferred to cover up and lie. Jean-Pierre, on the contrary, seeks to hurt, shock and wants it to be known...Why? Because he&#x27;s unruly, while I was sly. Because his excitability requires that things happen to him, and when they don&#x27;t occur quickly enough, he provokes them&quot;. In his final interview, Truffaut mentioned he was happy with how Léaud improvised within the flexibly written script.

Jean-Pierre Léaud, then in the eighth grade at a private school in Pontigny, was a far from ideal student. The director of the school wrote this to Truffaut, &quot;I regret to inform you that Jean-Pierre is more and more &#x27;unmanageable&#x27;. Indifference, arrogance, permanent defiance, lack of discipline in all its forms. He has twice been caught leafing through pornographic pictures in the dorm. He is developing more and more into an emotionally disturbed case&quot;. But this unstable boy, who often ran away with the older students on their nights out, could also be brilliant, generous, and affectionate. Extremely cultured for his age, he was already very good at writing, and he even claimed to Truffaut that he had written a &quot;verse tragedy&quot;, &quot;Torquatus&quot;.

==Truffaut&#x27;s influence from adolescence into adulthood==

Throughout the production of &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (&quot;Les Quatre Cents Coups&quot;, 1959), wrote Jay Carr, &quot;Truffaut would take Léaud to see rushes of Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot; each evening. They&#x27;d sit up late talking film with Godard, Rivette, Rohmer, Eustache, Orson Welles.&quot; Upon the filmmaker&#x27;s death, the actor reminisced Truffaut was the first person he admired and that he &quot;spoke to children like they were adults. He realized that children understood things better than adults did. He was purely intuitive. We operated in a sort of complicity.&quot;

During and following the filming of &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;, Truffaut&#x27;s concern for Léaud extended beyond the film set. He took charge of the difficult adolescent&#x27;s upbringing after Léaud was expelled from school and kicked out of the home of the retired couple taking care of him. Truffaut subsequently rented a studio apartment for Léaud. Truffaut also hired him for assistant work on &quot;The Soft Skin&quot; (&quot;La peau douce&quot;, 1964) and &quot;Mata Hari, Agent H21&quot; (1964).

==Acting career==

Léaud starred in four more Truffaut films depicting the life of Doinel, spanning a period of 20 years—after the short-film &quot;Antoine et Colette&quot; in 1962—beside actress Claude Jade as his girlfriend, and then wife, Christine. Those films are &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot; (1968), &quot;Bed and Board&quot; (1970) and &quot;Love on the Run&quot; (1979). Truffaut stated that Léaud was the source of inspiration for the Antoine Doinel character and &quot;I created some scenes just because I knew he would be funny in them—at least I laughed during the writing as I thought of him.&quot; He also collaborated with Truffaut on non-Antoine Doinel films like &quot;Two English Girls&quot; (&quot;Les Deux Anglaises et le Continent&quot;, 1971) and &quot;Day for Night&quot; (&quot;La Nuit américaine&quot;, 1973) and became the actor most commonly affiliated with him. Although Antoine Doinel is his most familiar character, he often found his performances in other films to be compared to his Doinel character whether there were legitimate similarities or not.

Léaud is one of the most visible and well-known actors to be associated with the French New Wave film movement and, aside from his work with Truffaut, collaborated with Jean-Luc Godard (nine films), Jean Eustache, Jacques Rivette and Agnès Varda. The early 1970s was perhaps the peak of his professional career when he had three critically acclaimed films released: Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; (1972), Truffaut&#x27;s &quot;La Nuit américaine&quot;, and Eustache&#x27;s &quot;The Mother and the Whore&quot; (both 1973). In the Bertolucci film, Léaud appeared in the same film as a hero of his, Marlon Brando, although the two men never met, since all of Léaud&#x27;s scenes were shot on Saturdays and Brando refused to work on Saturdays.

In March 1966, Léaud won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival for his role in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Masculin, féminin&quot;. He was nominated for a César Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1988 for Les Keufs and was awarded an Honorary César for lifetime achievement in 2000.

Léaud acted in films by other influential directors, such as Pier Paolo Pasolini, Jerzy Skolimowski, Aki Kaurismäki, Olivier Assayas, Tsai Ming-liang, Bertrand Bonello and Albert Serra.

==Personal life==

He is married to the French actress Brigitte Duvivier.

<text>A woodblock (also spelled as two words, wood block) is a small slit drum made from a single piece of wood. The term generally signifies the Western orchestral instrument, but may also refer to the Chinese woodblock. In ragtime and jazz music, it is also known as the clog box or tap box. In orchestral music scores, woodblocks may be indicated by the French &quot;bloc de bois&quot; or &quot;tambour de bois&quot;, German &quot;Holzblock&quot; or &quot;Holzblocktrommel&quot;, or Italian &quot;cassa di legno&quot;.

The orchestral woodblock of the West is generally made from teak or another hardwood. The dimensions of this instrument vary, although it is either a rectangular or cylindrical block of wood with one or sometimes two longitudinal cavities. It is played by striking it with a stick, which produces a sharp crack. Alternatively, a rounder mallet, soft or hard, may be used, which produces a deeper-pitched and fuller &quot;knocking&quot; sound.

On a drum kit, a woodblock is traditionally mounted on a clamp fixed to the top of the rear rim of the bass drum.

==Related instruments==
Log drums made from hollowed logs, and slit drums made from bamboo, are used in Africa and the Pacific Islands.

The muyu () is a rounded woodblock carved in the shape of a fish and struck with a wooden stick. It is made in various sizes and is often used in Buddhist chanting, in China as well as in other Asian nations including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Also, in China, a small, rectangular, high-pitched woodblock called &quot;bangzi&quot; () is used. Typically used in sets of four different pitches, they are sometimes called &quot;skulls&quot; by jazz players because of their globular shape.

Temple blocks are a set of four or more woodblocks. Modern versions may be made of plastic instead of wood where they are known as granite blocks. Similarly, the jam block is a modern, plastic version of the woodblock.

<doc id="306685" wikidata="Q1182714" url="?curid=306685" title="Deflagration">
<text>Deflagration (Lat: &quot;de + flagrare&quot;, &#x27;to burn down&#x27;) is subsonic combustion in which a pre-mixed flame propagates through an explosive or a mixture of fuel and oxidizer. Deflagrations in high and low explosives or fuel–oxidizer mixtures may transition to a detonation depending upon confinement and other factors. Most fires found in daily life are diffusion flames. Deflagrations with flame speeds in the range of 1 m/s differ from detonations which propagate supersonically with detonation velocities in the range of km/s.

==Applications==
Deflagrations are often used in engineering applications when the force of the expanding gas is used to move an object such as a projectile down a barrel, or a piston in an internal combustion engine. Deflagration systems and products can also be used in mining, demolition and stone quarrying via gas pressure blasting as a beneficial alternative to high explosives.

== Terminology of explosive safety ==
When studying or discussing explosive safety, or the safety of systems containing explosives, the terms deflagration, detonation and deflagration-to-detonation transition (commonly referred to as DDT) must be understood and used appropriately to convey relevant information. As explained above, a deflagration is a subsonic reaction, whereas a detonation is a supersonic (greater than the sound speed of the material) reaction. Distinguishing between a deflagration or a detonation can be difficult to impossible to the casual observer. Rather, confidently differentiating between the two requires instrumentation and diagnostics to ascertain reaction speed in the affected material. Therefore, when an unexpected event or an accident occurs with an explosive material or an explosive-containing system it is usually impossible to know whether the explosive deflagrated or detonated as both can appear as very violent, energetic reactions. Therefore, the energetic materials community coined the term &quot;high explosive violent reaction&quot; or &quot;HEVR&quot; to describe a violent reaction that, because it lacked diagnostics to measure sound-speed, could have been either a deflagration or a detonation. 

== Flame physics ==
The underlying flame physics can be understood with the help of an idealized model consisting of a uniform one-dimensional tube of unburnt and burned gaseous fuel, separated by a thin transitional region of width formula_1 in which the burning occurs. The burning region is commonly referred to as the flame or flame front. In equilibrium, thermal diffusion across the flame front is balanced by the heat supplied by burning.

Two characteristic timescales are important here. The first is the thermal diffusion timescale formula_2, which is approximately equal to

formula_3

where formula_4 is the thermal diffusivity. The second is the burning timescale formula_5 that strongly decreases with temperature, typically as

formula_6

where formula_7 is the activation barrier for the burning reaction and formula_8 is the temperature developed as the result of burning; the value of this so-called &quot;flame temperature&quot; can be determined from the laws of thermodynamics.

For a stationary moving deflagration front, these two timescales must be equal: the heat generated by burning is equal to the heat carried away by heat transfer. This makes it possible to calculate the characteristic width formula_9 of the flame front:

formula_10

thus

formula_11

Now, the thermal flame front propagates at a characteristic speed formula_12, which is simply equal to the flame width divided by the burn time:

formula_13

This simplified model neglects the change of temperature and thus the burning rate across the deflagration front. This model also neglects the possible influence of turbulence. As a result, this derivation gives only the laminar flame speed—hence the designation formula_12.

==Damaging events==

Damage to buildings, equipment and people can result from a large-scale, short-duration deflagration. The potential damage is primarily a function of the total amount of fuel burned in the event (total energy available), the maximum reaction velocity that is achieved, and the manner in which the expansion of the combustion gases is contained. Vented deflagrations tend to be less violent or damaging than contained deflagrations.

In free-air deflagrations, there is a continuous variation in deflagration effects relative to the maximum flame velocity. When flame velocities are low, the effect of a deflagration is to release heat, such as in a flash fire. At flame velocities near the speed of sound, the energy released is in the form of pressure, and the resulting high pressure can damage equipment and buildings.

<text>Detonation () is a type of combustion involving a supersonic exothermic front accelerating through a medium that eventually drives a shock front propagating directly in front of it. Detonations propagate supersonically through shock waves with speeds about 1 km/sec and differ from deflagrations which have subsonic flame speeds about 1 m/sec. Detonation may form from an explosion of fuel-oxidizer mixture. Compared with deflagration, detonation doesn&#x27;t need to have an external oxidizer. Oxidizers and fuel mix when deflagration occurs. Detonation is more destructive than deflagrations. In detonation, the flame front travels through the air-fuel faster than sound; while in deflagration, the flame front travels through the air-fuel slower than sound.

Detonations occur in both conventional solid and liquid explosives, as well as in reactive gases. TNT, dynamite, and C4 are examples of high power explosives that detonate. The velocity of detonation in solid and liquid explosives is much higher than that in gaseous ones, which allows the wave system to be observed with greater detail (higher resolution).

A very wide variety of fuels may occur as gases (e.g. hydrogen), droplet fogs, or dust suspensions. In addition to dioxygen, oxidants can include halogen compounds, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and oxides of nitrogen. Gaseous detonations are often associated with a mixture of fuel and oxidant in a composition somewhat below conventional flammability ratios. They happen most often in confined systems, but they sometimes occur in large vapor clouds. Other materials, such as acetylene, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide, are detonable in the absence of an oxidant (or reductant). In these cases the energy released results from the rearrangement of the molecular constituents of the material.

Detonation was discovered in 1881 by four French scientists Marcellin Berthelot and Paul Marie Eugène Vieille and Ernest-François Mallard and Henry Louis Le Chatelier. The mathematical predictions of propagation were carried out first by David Chapman in 1899 and by Émile Jouguet in 1905, 1906 and 1917. The next advance in understanding detonation was made by John von Neumann and Werner Döring in the early 1940s and Yakov B. Zel&#x27;dovich and Aleksandr Solomonovich Kompaneets in the 1960s.

== Theories ==
The simplest theory to predict the behaviour of detonations in gases is known as the Chapman–Jouguet (CJ) condition, developed around the turn of the 20th century. This theory, described by a relatively simple set of algebraic equations, models the detonation as a propagating shock wave accompanied by exothermic heat release. Such a theory describes the chemistry and diffusive transport processes as occurring abruptly as the shock passes.

A more complex theory was advanced during World War II independently by Zel&#x27;dovich, von Neumann, and Döring. This theory, now known as ZND theory, admits finite-rate chemical reactions and thus describes a detonation as an infinitesimally thin shock wave, followed by a zone of exothermic chemical reaction. With a reference frame of a stationary shock, the following flow is subsonic, so that an acoustic reaction zone follows immediately behind the lead front, the Chapman–Jouguet condition.

There is also some evidence that the reaction zone is semi-metallic in some explosives.

Both theories describe one-dimensional and steady wavefronts. However, in the 1960s, experiments revealed that gas-phase detonations were most often characterized by unsteady, three-dimensional structures, which can only, in an averaged sense, be predicted by one-dimensional steady theories. Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed. The Wood-Kirkwood detonation theory can correct some of these limitations.

Experimental studies have revealed some of the conditions needed for the propagation of such fronts. In confinement, the range of composition of mixes of fuel and oxidant and self-decomposing substances with inerts are slightly below the flammability limits and, for spherically expanding fronts, well below them. The influence of increasing the concentration of diluent on expanding individual detonation cells has been elegantly demonstrated. Similarly, their size grows as the initial pressure falls. Since cell widths must be matched with minimum dimension of containment, any wave overdriven by the initiator will be quenched.

Mathematical modeling has steadily advanced to predicting the complex flow fields behind shocks inducing reactions. To date, none has adequately described how the structure is formed and sustained behind unconfined waves.

== Applications ==

When used in explosive devices, the main cause of damage from a detonation is the supersonic blast front (a powerful shock wave) in the surrounding area. This is a significant distinction from deflagrations where the exothermic wave is subsonic and maximum pressures for non-metal specks of dust are approximately 7–10 times atmospheric pressure. Therefore, detonation is a feature for destructive purposes while deflagration is favored for the acceleration of firearms&#x27; projectiles. However, detonation waves may also be used for less destructive purposes, including deposition of coatings to a surface or cleaning of equipment (e.g. slag removal) and even explosively welding together metals that would otherwise fail to fuse. Pulse detonation engines use the detonation wave for aerospace propulsion. The first flight of an aircraft powered by a pulse detonation engine took place at the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port on January 31, 2008.

== In engines and firearms ==
Unintentional detonation when deflagration is desired is a problem in some devices. In Otto cycle, or gasoline engines it is called engine knocking or pinging, and it causes a loss of power. It can also cause excessive heating, and harsh mechanical shock that can result in eventual engine failure. In firearms, it may cause catastrophic and potentially lethal failure.

Pulse detonation engines are a form of pulsed jet engine that has been experimented with on several occasions as this offers the potential for good fuel efficiency.

<text>Santa Cruz Futebol Clube is a Brazilian professional football club based in Recife, Pernambuco, that competes in the Série D, the fourth tier of Brazilian football, and in the Campeonato Pernambucano, the top flight of the Pernambuco state football league.

==History==

===Early history===
On 3 February 1914, eleven young men aging from 14 to 16 years founded a football society. Because the boys used to play football on the streets by the yard of the &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; Church, the club was named after that church, which is situated on Santa Cruz Street in Recife. At the first meeting, they decided the position of each member, the name of the club &quot;Santa Cruz Foot-Ball Club&quot;, and the society&#x27;s colors.

The original colors were black and white. Some time after, the color pattern was changed because another local team (Sport Club Flamengo) already had those colors. Therefore, the club included the red color by suggestion of Teófilo Batista de Carvalho, also known as &quot;Lacraia&quot;. &quot;Lacraia&quot; has participated in all major early events of Santa Cruz&#x27;s history, except the foundation.

Many people came to see the first match at &quot;Derby plains&quot;. The &quot;team of boys&quot; as Santa Cruz was called at the time beat &quot;Rio Negro&quot; (Black River) by 7–0. &quot;Rio Negro&quot; demanded revenge in another match. Curiously, the terms of the revenge stated that Sílvio Machado (he scored five goals in the first match) could not play. Despite that, Santa Cruz accepted the challenge. Carlindo, who substituted Sílvio Machado, scored six goals and Santa Cruz won again by 9–0. A subsequent victory over the &quot;Western Telegraph Company&quot; team, very famous at the time, made the popularity of Santa Cruz increase even more.

The club was almost closed in its very first year. Some members proposed to use the club funds to buy a sugarcane juice extractor. Alexandre Carvalho (see members above) violently disapproved of such an offensive proposal and effectively saved the club. In early 20th century Recife, football was regarded as an elite sport. It was played mostly by upper-class boys and by the workers of English companies that operated in Recife. At that time racism was common and Afro-Brazilians were not allowed to play football. Santa Cruz, however, was the first team in Pernambuco to accept them. &quot;Lacraia&quot;, was the first one. This fact contributed to the popularity of the team, as black people are numerous in Brazilian population.
Campeonato Pernambucano
In 1915, there was Brazilian football&#x27;s greatest comeback. At Aflitos stadium, Santa Cruz was trailing América (Pernambuco), 5–1, but in the bottom 15 minutes of the match the score changed, 6–5. In 1917, the club was accepted into the Pernambucan Sport League, the precursor name of the Pernambucan Football Federation.

On 30 January 1919, Santa Cruz beat Botafogo 3–2 on the Malaquias field. Alberto Santos-Dumont, the airplane pioneer, was in Recife, but was unnoticed: Santa Cruz&#x27;s victory took everyone&#x27;s attention. On 31 January, the &quot;Jornal Pequeno&quot; (&quot;Small Newspaper&quot;) printed in the headlines: &quot;Botafogo Futebol Clube is beaten by the home &quot;boys&quot; by 3–2.&quot; It was the first time that a northern-northeastern team beat a team from the south-eastern region of Brazil.

On 13 December 1931, Santa Cruz with Tará and Sherlock as the most important contributors successfully pursued its first Campeonato Pernambucano against Torre, 2–0. On 10 October 1934, the Brazil national team, newly home from the 1934 World Cup in Italy, played some friendlies against the major teams of Pernambuco: Sport Recife was defeated 4–2; Náutico was beaten 8–3, and Santa Cruz was defeated 3–1. A ship delay on return to Rio de Janeiro enabled Santa Cruz to equalize the initial loss, 3–2.

==== Suicidal Tour ====

In 1943, faced with financial hardship, the club arranged for 5 friendly matches against local-club Transviário Esporte Clube in Belém, Pará to promote Santa Cruz&#x27;s image and a payday of five million Brazilian réis. Their travel to Belém was marked by fears of attacks by German U-boats, as the tour began during World War II. This resulted in their steamboat, &quot;,&quot; being escorted by two Brazilian Naval ships and the steamboat having to sail with its lights off.

After the five friendly matches, the club was invited to extend their club tour into Amazonas by Olímpico Clube. This resulted in the team traveling by steamboat up the Amazon River at a speed of ten nautical miles per day, resulting in a two week travel time to reach Manaus. During their stint in Amazonas, the head of the delegation and six players contracted dysentery after their match against Rio Negro, to which those effected recovered before their next matches. 

After the matches in Amazonas, the delegation aimed for an international stint in Peru and Guyana, but was blocked by the Brazilian Sports Federation at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for clubs to not leave the country during World War II. Facing a 90-day suspension if they continued on, the delegation gave up and returned to Belém via steamboat. During this return, two of the players, Goalkeeper King and Striker Papeira, were diagnosed with typhoid fever, resulting in hospitalization and, eventually, their deaths. 

In total, at least 26 matches were played over the course of a 4 month tour, which left two players dead and the club broke again, after paying travel costs and funeral expenses. From this, the club tour became known as the &quot;Suicidal Tour&quot; due to the deaths, difficulties faced, financial hardship, and the threat of German submarine attacks.

===1960s and 1970s===
During the late 1960s and the 1970s, Santa Cruz achieved greater popularity.
Much of that was due to the 5 times state championship title achievement (State Penta-championship) of Santa Cruz.
Santa Cruz&#x27;s impressive performances in the National championship, expanded awareness of the club&#x27;s talent beyond the state of Pernambuco.

Santa Cruz in Série A increased awareness about its abilities outside of the state when the club out performed Flamengo in 1965 at Maracanã Stadium, 3–1. The club were having great performances and obtained first place in the National Championship&#x27;s first stage.

In 1972, Pelé played his 1000th match against Santa Cruz.

In 1975, Santa Cruz reached the semifinals of the Campeonato Brasileiro, a first for a northeastern team. The controversial semi-final against Cruzeiro on 7 December ended with Cruzeiro winning 3–2. The club achieved fourth place, their best performance in the National Championship to date. Santa Cruz went without a match loss in 1977 and 1978 during their successful pursuit of the Brazilian Championship for 35 consecutive seasons, the second greatest title run in the national competition. In 1978, Santa Cruz was the first team to qualify for the 2nd Stage of the National Championship, with 23 points. In the second and third stages, Santa Cruz topped both of their groups, and qualified for the quarterfinals, where they lost to Sport Club Internacional. In the final standings, Santa Cruz finished in fifth.

===1980s and 1990s===
During the 1980s, Santa Cruz was relegated to the Second Division of the National Championship twice (1982 and 1989). Since then the club&#x27;s performance in national competitions has declined.

In the early 1990s, Santa Cruz won three successive state championships: (1990, 1993 and 1995). However, being in the second division of the National Championship often eclipsed such achievements. Moreover, in the following years, Santa Cruz had to share the championship 5 consecutive titles with an arch-rival. Santa Cruz unsuccessfully stopped Sport Recife in their pursuit of a 5th successive championship. Nevertheless, in 1996, Maurício was the top scorer of the 2nd Division Brazilian Championship with 13 goals.

=== 2000–11: Further decline ===
Since the final match in the 2006 Campeonato Pernambucano vs. Sport, in which Sport won the championship, the team has experienced a new decline. It was delegated to Second Division in 2006 and then to the Third Division in 2007 after weak campaigns. That latest decline also included eliminations in the first rounds of the Copa do Brasil (2007 and 2009) by weaker teams like Nacional Fast Clube and Americano, that were then playing regional competitions. 

Continuing the decline was the downfall into &quot;Hexagonal da Morte&quot;, the bottom six, in the 2008 Campeonato Pernambucano, narrowly escaping relegation in the seventh match. Also, in September 2008, after another weak campaign in the 2008 Série C, Santa Cruz was relegated to the new Fourth Division for 2009, becoming the first club to fall from First Division to Fourth in three years.

=== 2011–present ===
In 2011, Santa Cruz started a reaction. The club was eliminated from the Copa do Brasil in the second phase by São Paulo, but had a respectable performance. Santa Cruz won the first game 1–0, but lost in the second game 2–0. On 15 May, Santa Cruz won the Campeonato Pernambucano, beating Sport Recife. That year, Santa Cruz had the highest attendance average in all Brazilian football, beating teams like Flamengo and Corinthians.

In 2013, Santa Cruz won the Campeonato Pernambucano, and became &quot;tricampeao&quot; (three-time consecutive champion), beating rivals Sport Recife as they had done in 2011 and 2012 as well. 

In May 2016, Santa Cruz won the Copa do Nordeste for the first time in its history, and earned a spot in the 2016 Copa Sudamericana, their first international participation. The team began their campaign in the second stage, beating Sport Recife 1–0 on aggregate. In the third stage, the club was paired up with Colombian club Independiente Medellín. Santa Cruz lost the first leg in Colombia 2–0, but won 3–1 in Recife with a hat-trick from Grafite, although it was not enough and the club was eliminated on away goals. The team also won the Campeonato Pernambuco that year, beating Sport again, as they had done in the previous four finals.

==Symbols==

===Colors===
The original colors of the club were black and white. However, at that time, the Pernambucan Sport League did not allow the participation of different clubs with the same colors. Thus, the red color was introduced to differentiate from the color pattern of Sport Club Flamengo.

Santa Cruz is also known as &quot;O Tricolor&quot; (The Tricolor) and its fans
as &quot;Tricolores&quot;.

===Badge===
The original badge (not depicted here) was designed by Teófilo Batista de Carvalho aka &quot;Lacraia&quot;.
The inclusion of red colour in the club patterns is also due to &quot;Lacraia&quot;.

As time passed, the badge design was modified and updated. However the &quot;Lacraia&quot;″s original concept was not much modified.

The current badge contains several stars. The top three-colored stars represent the three Super-championships that Santa Cruz won. The bottom golden stars represent the Penta-championship.

===Mascot===
With the adoption of three colors, the striped jersey of Santa Cruz resembled a Coral snake. Due to this, the team is known by the fans as &quot;Coral&quot;.

===Anthem===
The official anthem of the club is widely unknown by the fans. However, a march named &quot;O Mais Querido&quot; (The Dearest One) by Lourenço da Fonseca Barbosa (Capiba) is very popular and is the &quot;de facto&quot; anthem.

==Stadium==
The team&#x27;s stadium, Estádio José do Rego Maciel, is located in Arruda, a borough of Recife. It is named after a former mayor of Recife. It is widely known as &quot;Estádio do Arruda&quot; (Arruda Stadium). The fans call it &quot;Arrudão&quot; (Big Arruda) or &quot;Mundão do Arruda&quot; (Great Land of Arruda).

On 1 April 1982 the stadium was re-inaugurated after improvements and enlargement. From the original capacity of 64,000 people, the maximum capacity was then estimated at 110,000. However, due to safety reasons, the maximum capacity so far is 90,200, which occurred in a Brazil vs Argentina match on 23 March 1994. Since then the official stadium capacity has been reduced to 60,044.

The stadium is also known as the &quot;Repúblicas Independentes do Arruda&quot; (Independent Republics of Arruda).

===The Super-Championship===
The Pernambucan Football Championship is usually divided into three turns. Each turn is a small championship itself. If a team wins all the three turns then it is automatically declared as champion. If a team wins two turns and another team wins the remaining turn, the championship has a final play-off. Generally, the play-off consists of two matches or three matches. However, if three different teams win each one a turn, the championship has a play-off named the Super-championship. The Super-championship consists of a play-off among the three winners of each turn. Super-championships are rare and very prestigious.

The Blue Ribbon.
The Blue Ribbon is a prestigious award given by the Confederation of Brazilian Football (&quot;Confederação Brasileira de Futebol&quot; – CBF).

<text>A quiz is a form of mind sport in which people attempt to answer questions correctly on one or several topics. Quizzes can be used as a brief assessment in education and similar fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, and skills, or simply as a hobby. They can also be televised for entertainment purposes, often in a game show format.

==Etymology==
The earliest known examples of the word date back to 1780; its etymology is unknown, but it may have originated in student slang. It initially meant an &quot;odd, eccentric person&quot; or a &quot;joke, hoax&quot;. Later (perhaps by association with words such as &quot;inquisitive&quot;), it came to mean &quot;to observe, study intently&quot;, and thence (from about the mid-19th century) &quot;test, exam.&quot;

There is a well-known myth about the word &quot;quiz&quot; that says that in 1791, a Dublin theatre owner named Richard Daly made a bet that he could introduce a word into the language within 24 hours. He then went out and hired a group of street children to write the word &quot;quiz&quot;, which was a nonsense word, on walls around the city of Dublin. Within a day, the word was common currency and had acquired a meaning (since no one knew what it meant, everyone thought it was some sort of test), and Daly had some extra cash in his pocket. However, there is no evidence to support the story, and the term was already in use before the alleged bet in 1791.

==As competitions== 

Quizzes may be held on a variety of subjects (general knowledge or &#x27;pot luck&#x27; (which could be anything)) or subject-specific. The format of the quiz can also vary. Popularly known competition quizzes include

==World record==
The largest quiz, according to Guinness, was the &quot;Quiz for Life&quot;, held at the Flanders Expo Halls in Ghent, Belgium, on 11 December 2010 with 2,280 participants. The winning team &quot;Café De Kastaar&quot; from Leuven consisted of Marnix Baes, Erik Derycke, Eric Hemelaers, Bart Permentier and Tom Trogh.

==In education==
In an educational context, a quiz is usually a form of a student assessment, but often has fewer questions of less difficulty and requires less time for completion than a test. This use is typically found in the United States, Canada, the Philippines, Dominican Republic and some colleges in India.
For instance, in a mathematics classroom, a quiz may check comprehension of a type of mathematical exercise. Some instructors schedule a daily or weekly quiz ranging from five to thirty relatively easy questions for the purpose of having the students review their previous lessons before attending the next class. A &quot;pop quiz&quot; is a quiz that students are given no time to prepare for; they are simply surprised with it in class.

==Other quizzes==
Additionally, a personality quiz may be a series of multiple-choice questions about the respondent without right or wrong answers. The responses to these questions are tallied according to a key, and the result purports to reveal some quality of the respondent. This kind of &quot;quiz&quot; was originally popularized by women&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. They have since become common on the Internet, where the result page typically includes code which can be added to a blog entry to publicize the result. These postings are common on many sites like LiveJournal.

The results of online quizzes are generally to be taken lightly, as they do not often reflect the true personality or relationship. They are also rarely psychometrically valid. However, they may occasion reflection on the subject of the quiz and provide a springboard for a person to explore his or her emotions, beliefs, actions or to put some already acquired knowledge to the test.

<doc id="306704" wikidata="Q559794" url="?curid=306704" title="Elihu Thomson">
<text>Elihu Thomson (March 29, 1853 – March 13, 1937) was an English-American engineer and inventor who was instrumental in the founding of major electrical companies in the United States, the United Kingdom and France.

==Early life==
He was born in Manchester, England, on March 29, 1853, but his family moved to Philadelphia in the United States in 1858. Thomson attended Central High School in Philadelphia and graduated in 1870. Thomson took a teaching position at Central, and in 1876, at the age of twenty-three, held the chair of Chemistry. In 1880, he left Central to pursue research in the emerging field of electrical engineering.

==Electrical innovations==
With Edwin J. Houston, a former teacher and later colleague of Thomson&#x27;s at Central High School, Thomson founded the Thomson-Houston Electric Company. Notable inventions created by Thomson during this period include an arc-lighting system, an automatically regulated three-coil dynamo, a magnetic lightning arrester, and a local power transformer. In 1892 the Thomson-Houston Electric Company merged with the Edison General Electric Company to become the General Electric Company.

The historian Thomas P. Hughes writes that Thomson &quot;displayed methodological characteristics in the workshop and the laboratory as [an] inventor and in the business world as [an] entrepreneur. He also chose to solve problems in the rapidly expanding field of electric light and power.&quot; Thomson&#x27;s name is further commemorated by the British Thomson-Houston Company (BTH), and the French companies Thomson SA (now Technicolor SA) and Alstom (formerly Alsthom).

Thomson was notable both for his emphasis on models and for the singular focus with which he pursued his research, with Thomson referring to his workshop as a &quot;model room&quot; rather than a laboratory. Between 1880 and 1885, Thomson averaged twenty-one patent applications annually, doubling that average between 1885 and 1890.

Upon the merger of Thomson-Houston Electric Company (his namesake company) to form General Electric in 1892, Thomson chose to keep his laboratory at Lynn, Massachusetts near Boston away from GE&#x27;s New York headquarters to ensure his control over his research. At the Lynn GE plant, he worked with Edwin Rice (later President of GE in 1913) and Sanford Moss and Charles Steinmetz (who was located at GE headquarters in Schenectady, New York). After being asked to become a director of GE, Thomson rejected the offer preferring continued research to management.

==Patents==
Thomson held more than 700 patents. Thomson used his patents to bolster his company, Thomson-Houston Company, later General Electric.

Thomson was the first recipient of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Edison Medal, bestowed upon him in 1909 &quot;For meritorious achievement in electrical science, engineering and arts as exemplified in his contributions thereto during the past thirty years.&quot;; Thomson was also president of the organization from 1889–90. Near the end of his life, Thomson&#x27;s second wife Clarissa Hovey Thomson is reported to have said that she had to carry a basket with her to carry all of Thomson&#x27;s awards and honors.

He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1876.

In 1889, he was decorated by the French Government for his electrical inventions, being made Chevalier et Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur. He received the honorary degree of A.M. from Yale (1890). Tufts College in 1892 gave him the degree of Ph.D., and in 1899 he received a D.Sc. from Harvard.

== Personal life==
He married Mary Louise Peck (born: June 1, 1856 in New Britain, Hartford County, Connecticut) on May 1, 1884.

*Roland Davis Thomson b: June 17, 1888
*Malcolm Thomson b.: August 30, 1891
*Donald Thurston Thomson b.: April 10, 1893

His second wife was Clarissa Hovey Thomson.

==Later life==
He was a founding member, as well as the second president, of the International Electrotechnical Commission.

He served as acting president of MIT from 1920–1923. Thomson, overcoming his distaste for management, accepted this role during a critical period for the university when it could not otherwise find a president.

On June 21, 1932, at age 79, Thomson was interviewed on film talking about his life and times.

Thomson died at his estate in Swampscott, Massachusetts. The Elihu Thomson House in Swampscott was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1976 and serves as Swampscott&#x27;s town hall.

<doc id="306706" wikidata="Q900653" url="?curid=306706" title="Heisenberg picture">
<text>In physics, the Heisenberg picture or Heisenberg representation is a formulation (largely due to Werner Heisenberg in 1925) of quantum mechanics in which observables incorporate a dependency on time, but the states are time-independent. It stands in contrast to the Schrödinger picture in which observables are constant and the states evolve in time. 

It further serves to define a third, hybrid, picture, the interaction picture.

==Mathematical details==
In the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics the state vectors |&quot;ψ&quot;⟩ do not change with time, while observables satisfy
{\partial t} \right)_\text{H} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &quot;H&quot; and &quot;S&quot; label observables in Heisenberg and Schrödinger picture respectively, is the Hamiltonian and denotes the commutator of two operators (in this case and ). Taking expectation values automatically yields the Ehrenfest theorem, featured in the correspondence principle.

By the Stone–von Neumann theorem, the Heisenberg picture and the Schrödinger picture are unitarily equivalent, just a basis change in Hilbert space. In some sense, the Heisenberg picture is more natural and convenient than the equivalent Schrödinger picture, especially for relativistic theories. Lorentz invariance is manifest in the Heisenberg picture, since the state vectors do not single out the time or space.

This approach also has a more direct similarity to classical physics: by simply replacing the commutator above by the Poisson bracket, the Heisenberg equation reduces to an equation in Hamiltonian mechanics.

==Equivalence of Heisenberg&#x27;s equation to the Schrödinger equation==
For the sake of pedagogy, the Heisenberg picture is introduced here from the subsequent, but more familiar, Schrödinger picture.

According to Schrödinger&#x27;s equation, the quantum state at time formula_1 is formula_2, where formula_3 is the time-evolution operator induced by a Hamiltonian formula_4 that could depend on time, and formula_5 is the initial state. formula_6 refers to time-ordering, &quot;ħ&quot; is the reduced Planck constant, and &quot;i&quot; is the imaginary unit. The expectation value of an observable formula_7 in the Schrödinger picture, which is a Hermitian linear operator that could also be time-dependent, in the state formula_8 is given by
formula_9

In the Heisenberg picture, the quantum state is assumed to remain constant at its initial value formula_5, whereas operators evolve with time according to the definition 
formula_11
This readily implies formula_12, so the same expectation value can be obtained by working in either picture. The Schrödinger equation for the time-evolution operator is
formula_13 It follows that
formula_14
where differentiation was carried out according to the product rule. This is Heisenberg&#x27;s equation of motion. Note that the Hamiltonian that appears in the final line above is the Heisenberg Hamiltonian formula_15, which may differ from the Schrödinger Hamiltonian formula_16.

An important special case of the equation above is obtained if the Hamiltonian formula_17 does not vary with time. Then the time-evolution operator can be written as
formula_18
and hence formula_19 since formula_20 now commutes with formula_21. Therefore,
formula_22
and following the previous analyses, 
formula_23

Furthermore, if formula_24 is also time-independent, then the last term vanishes and

formula_25

where formula_26 in this particular case. The equation is solved by use of the standard operator identity,formula_27
which implies
formula_28

A similar relation also holds for classical mechanics, the classical limit of the above, given by the correspondence between Poisson brackets and commutators:
formula_29
In classical mechanics, for an &quot;A&quot; with no explicit time dependence,
formula_30 
so again the expression for &quot;A&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the Taylor expansion around &quot;t&quot; = 0.

In effect, the initial state of the quantum system has receded from view, and is only considered at the final step of taking specific expectation values or matrix elements of observables that evolved in time according to the Heisenberg equation of motion. A similar analysis applies if the initial state is mixed.

The time evolved state formula_31 in the Schrödinger picture is sometimes written as formula_32 to differentiate it from the evolved state formula_33 that appears in the different interaction picture.

==Commutator relations==
Commutator relations may look different than in the Schrödinger picture, because of the time dependence of operators. For example, consider the operators and . The time evolution of those operators depends on the Hamiltonian of the system. Considering the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator,
formula_34
the evolution of the position and momentum operators is given by:
formula_35
formula_36

Note that the Hamiltonian is time independent and hence formula_37 are the position and momentum operators in the Heisenberg picture. Differentiating both equations once more and solving for them with proper initial conditions,
formula_38
formula_39 
leads to
formula_40
formula_41

Direct computation yields the more general commutator relations,
formula_42
formula_43
formula_44

For formula_45, one simply recovers the standard canonical commutation relations valid in all pictures.

==Summary comparison of evolution in all pictures==

<text>Lempo () is a sort of fiend from Finnish folklore and mythology. Lempo is the god of love and fertility in Finnish mythology.

After Christianity came to Finland, the reputation of Lempo worsened: it is portrayed in the folklore usually as an erratic spirit, as love can be capricious, even dangerous, and it could even take control of a being and turn them to destruction.

Lempo brought down the hero Väinämöinen with the help of his two demon cohorts, Hiisi and Paha.

The words &quot;lempo&quot; and &quot;hiisi&quot; are also used as very mild swear words in the Finnish language. Piru is a slightly stronger swear word.

<doc id="306709" wikidata="Q6303415" url="?curid=306709" title="Judith Giuliani">
<text>Judi Ann Stish Ross Nathan Giuliani (born December 16, 1954) is an American registered nurse, former medical sales executive, charity fundraiser, and ex-wife of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. She was a managing director of philanthropic consulting firm Changing Our World and a founding board member of the Twin Towers Fund.

==Early life and education==
Judi Ann Stish was born and raised in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, a town known for its coal mining history. Her family is Roman Catholic of Italian descent on her father&#x27;s side and Polish descent on her mother&#x27;s side. The surname Stish was previously modified from Sticia. Her father, Donald Stish Sr., was a circulation manager for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, and her mother, Joan Ann (Ososki), is a homemaker. She had an older brother, Donald Jr., who died in 2004, and has a younger sister, Cyndy. As of 2007, her parents still resided in the same home where she grew up in Hazleton.

Stish graduated from Hazleton High School in 1972, where she participated in the Future Nurses Association, the Literary Society, the tennis and ski clubs, and the Diggers Club, a volunteer service organization. Interested in both the human and scientific aspects of the field, she attended a two-year nursing program, affiliated with Pennsylvania State University, at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and graduated with a registered nurse diploma on September 1, 1974. She credits her decision to become a registered nurse as &quot;one of the most practical, wonderful ones I ever made…because, aside from the science, you learn crisis management, decision making, prioritizing…&quot;

==First marriages, medical sales career, motherhood==
After graduation, Stish worked for a few months as a nurse at Sacred Heart Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania. On December 8, 1974, she and Jeffrey Ross, a medical supply salesman, eloped to Las Vegas and were married at the Chapel of the Bells. The couple soon relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, where they both took jobs with U.S. Surgical Corporation in 1975 selling medical supplies in the Southeast; Judi Ross specialized in showing doctors in operating rooms a new surgical stapling method. She and Ross separated amicably after four years, and their marriage ended in divorce which was finalized on November 14, 1979. The couple had no children.

On November 19, 1979, Judi Stish Ross married wallpaper salesman Bruce Nathan, whom she had met during her separation from her first husband. Judi Nathan stopped working around that time; the couple lived in Charlotte for two years, then moved to Atlanta, Georgia. The Nathans adopted a daughter, Whitney, in March 1985. The family moved to Manhattan in 1987 and Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles in 1991. During these years, she briefly worked for DynaMed Surgical in California. She also converted from Roman Catholicism to Presbyterianism.

The Nathans&#x27; marriage fell apart during the early 1990s and led to a contested divorce case and custody battle, which included accusations of abuse from both parties. The Nathans&#x27; divorce was finalized in 1992 and she won primary custody of their child. Nathan, who came to prefer the name &quot;Judith&quot; around this time, moved back to New York in March 1992. Now a single mother, she worked part-time in a dentist&#x27;s office and attended New York University computer and business classes at night and on weekends. Nathan received a New York nursing license and began working in 1993 as a pharmaceutical sales representative with the hospital sales division of Bristol-Myers Squibb, selling surgical supplies, anti-depressants, and antibiotics in the tough Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn; one of her specialties was infectious diseases. Around this time Judith became romantically involved with Woodhull Hospital clinical psychologist Manos Zacharioudakis; she and her daughter lived with him for four years, until early 1999. By 1997, she became one of Bristol-Myers&#x27; top sales managers,
 managing a 12-person sales team.

==Relationship with and marriage to Giuliani==
Judith Nathan met Mayor Giuliani in May 1999 at Club Macanudo, an Upper East Side cigar bar; they have said they were introduced by a doctor who is a mutual friend. Giuliani took the initiative in forming an ongoing relationship. The mayor was still married to and living with his second wife, Donna Hanover, although they had been publicly distant since 1996, and Nathan was still living with Zacharioudakis although the couple had separated a few months earlier. For most of a year, the relationship was kept secret, and in early 2000 Giuliani arranged for New York Police Department security and chauffeuring for her. By March 2000, Giuliani and Nathan were appearing together at public events; in May 2000, Giuliani publicly acknowledged her as his &quot;very good friend&quot; and, amidst a flurry of press scrutiny about Nathan, announced he was separating from Hanover. Nathan endeared herself to the mayor&#x27;s powerful inner circle of friends and advisers. Later in 2000, Giuliani credited Nathan&#x27;s nursing background in helping him through his treatment for prostate cancer. Nathan aggressively researched treatment options and Giuliani was quoted as saying, &quot;I felt so fortunate to have not only someone who loved me and cared about me, but also someone who was an expert with an enormous amount of knowledge of medicine and science — she was the single biggest support that I had.&quot;

Judith and Rudy Giuliani became engaged in Paris in November 2002 and married on May 24, 2003. The wedding was held at Gracie Mansion and was one of only two performed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The reception for 400 guests included figures from the political, entertainment, and fashion worlds. The couple had a $5 million apartment off Madison Avenue in the Upper East Side in Manhattan and a $4 million summer home in The Hamptons.

Rudy Giuliani frequently cited his wife as his &quot;closest adviser&quot;, saying in 2007 that she remained &quot;an expert we rely on&quot; at his company, Giuliani Partners, where he has served as chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;She gives us a lot of advice and a lot of help in areas where she&#x27;s got a lot of expertise – biological and chemical. Since we do security work, that&#x27;s an area of great concern – you know, another anthrax attack, a smallpox attack, chemical agents. She knows all of that.&quot; From shortly before their marriage until his presidential campaign began, Rudy Giuliani paid her an average of $125,000 per year for her professional value as a speechwriter.

===Role in Giuliani presidential campaign===
As Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s presidential campaign began in earnest in 2007, Judith Giuliani served as an advisor and fundraiser, but also came in for a new round of intense and often unflattering media attention. Her first marriage to Jeffrey Ross was revealed in the press for the first time, her educational background was clarified, and she appeared in a Barbara Walters interview on &quot;20/20&quot;. During the interview, the Giulianis stated that she would sit in on Cabinet meetings were he elected, a plan that attracted criticism and that they later backed away from. There was controversy about her travel requirements and conflicts with Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s aides. Media outlets portrayed her as someone aspiring to social status and given to extravagant shopping. An attempt by the campaign over summer 2007 to rehabilitate her image fell victim to internal tensions, and instead her public appearances were scaled back. Rudy Giuliani said that Judith Giuliani proved a capable fund-raiser who provided meaningful input on his policies, particularly those pertaining to health care, since she holds a two-year nursing degree and once sold pharmaceuticals.

On April 4, 2018, it was announced that Judith Giuliani had filed for divorce from her husband, Rudy Giuliani. The divorce was settled on December 10, 2019. On August 2, 2022, it was announced that Judith Giuliani had hired attorney Dror Bikel and filed a lawsuit against former husband for non-compliance regarding the divorce settlement.

==Fundraising and charitable work==

In March 2001, desiring less travel and reduced public visibility, Nathan left Bristol-Myers and became a fund-raiser and later the managing director of Changing Our World, an international fundraising and philanthropic services company headquartered in New York that helps not-for-profit groups raise money for causes such as juvenile blindness and HIV/AIDS in Africa. She left the organization in 2006 and continues to serve as a pro bono adviser.

After the September 11 attacks, Giuliani credited Nathan with coordinating the efforts of the Family Assistance Center at Pier 94, a claim disputed by the first director of New York City&#x27;s Office of Emergency Management, Jerry Hauer, but supported by others who say she played a valuable role there that lasted for four months. Rudy Giuliani wrote of this period in his 2002 book, &quot;Leadership&quot;, explaining that she capably served as a solid mayoral adviser after September 11 because she &quot;had been a nurse for many years, and afterward a pharmaceutical executive; she had managed a team of people and had many organizational skills. Further, she had wide-ranging scientific knowledge and research expertise.&quot; In addition, he said that he &quot;put her to work helping me organize the hospitals&quot; to assist those injured in the attacks.

She became a founding board member of the Twin Towers Fund, appointed by Giuliani, which raised and distributed $216 million to over 1,150 families and individuals. Contributions to the fund also created the TTF Scholarship Fund and America’s Camp for victims&#x27; children.

Judith Giuliani also acted as the national spokesperson for Women&#x27;s Heart Advantage, which seeks to raise awareness among women and their doctors about preventing heart-related health conditions. As a spokesperson for Women&#x27;s Heart Advantage, she promoted the organization as the first hospital-based program focusing on women and heart disease. In the preface to the book &quot;Mapping the New World of American Philanthropy&quot; (Wiley, 2007), Judith wrote of the opportunity the Baby-Boomer generation has to define its legacy through lasting philanthropy.

Additionally, Judith Giuliani has raised funds for Southampton Hospital, Finding a Cure for Epilepsy and Seizures (FACES), Christian Blind Mission International (CBMI), Hurricane Katrina relief in New Orleans, St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital Level 1 Trauma Unit, Cabrini High School and Cabrini Medical Center, and the McCarton School for autistic children.

For her service, Judith has received the Community Award from the New York Junior League, the Spirit of Cabrini Service Award from the Cabrini Mission Foundation, and in May 2006 she received the New York University Humanitarian Award. Giuliani was recognized for her role as a nurse for humanitarian and charitable endeavors, as well as for serving as a prominent voice in promoting the nursing profession.

<text>A piano concerto, a type of concerto, is a solo composition in the classical music genre which is composed for piano accompanied by an orchestra or other large ensemble. Piano concertos are typically virtuosic showpieces which require an advanced level of technique. Piano concertos are typically written out in music notation, including sheet music for the pianist (which is typically memorized for a more virtuosic performance), orchestral parts, and a full score for the conductor.

The standard practice in the Baroque and Classical eras (together spanning from circa 1600 to circa 1800), was for the orchestra to provide subordinate accompaniment over which the piano plays solo parts. However, at the end of the classical era, the orchestra had an equal role to the pianist and frequently had “dialogue” or “conversation” between the two. When music students and music competition auditionees play piano concertos, the orchestra part may be performed in an orchestral reduction, a conversion of the orchestra parts into a part for an accompanist playing piano or pipe organ, as it is very expensive to hire a full orchestra. Keyboard concerti were common in the time of Johann Sebastian Bach in the Baroque music era, during the Classical period and during the Romantic music era (1800–1910). Keyboard concertos are also written by contemporary classical music composers. Twentieth- and 21st-century piano concertos may include experimental or unusual performance techniques. In the 20th and 21st centuries, J. S. Bach&#x27;s harpsichord concertos are sometimes played on piano. There are variant types of piano concertos, including double piano concertos, for two solo pianists and orchestra, and double or triple (or larger solo groups) concertos in which the piano soloist is joined by a violinist, cellist, or another instrumentalist.

==History==

The earliest piano concertos were composed in London. Inspired by instrument maker Johannes Zumpe, composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Friedrich Händel and Carl Friedrich Abel began writing concertos for harpsichord and string ensemble in about 1770.

During the Classical era, the form quickly took hold across Europe, especially Germany and Austria, becoming established with works especially by Mozart, along with lesser-known examples by Haydn, Carl Phillip Emanuel Bach, Carl Stamitz, and Joseph Wölfl. In the early Romantic period the piano concerto repertoire was added to most notably by Beethoven, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Hummel, Ferdinand Ries, and John Field.

Well-known examples from the middle to late Romantic era include concertos by Edvard Grieg, Johannes Brahms, Camille Saint-Saëns, Franz Liszt, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and Sergei Rachmaninoff. Alexander Scriabin, Antonín Dvořák, Edward MacDowell, and Franz Xaver Scharwenka wrote some lesser-known concertos during this time. In 1899, Amy Beach completed her Piano Concerto in C-sharp minor, the first piano concerto composed by a female American composer. Edward Elgar made sketches for a piano concerto but never completed it. In the 19th century, Henry Litolff blurred the boundary between piano concerto and symphony in his five works entitled &quot;Concerto Symphonique&quot;, and Ferruccio Busoni added a male choir in the last movement of his hour-long concerto. Wilhelm Furtwängler wrote his Symphonic Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, which lasts more than one hour, in 1924–1937. In a more general sense, the term &quot;piano concerto&quot; could extend to the numerous often programmatic concerted works for piano and orchestra from the era – Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Choral Fantasy&quot;. Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Totentanz&quot; and &quot;Ruins of Athens&quot; Variations, and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Burleske&quot; are only a few of the hundreds of such works. The few well-known piano concertos that dominate 20th-century and 21st-century concert programs and discographies are only a small part of the repertoire that proliferated on the European music scene during the 19th century.

===20th century and contemporary===
The piano concerto form survived through the 20th century into the 21st, with examples being written by Leroy Anderson, Milton Babbitt, Samuel Barber, Béla Bartók, Arthur Bliss, Edwin York Bowen, Benjamin Britten, Elliott Carter, Carlos Chávez, Aaron Copland, Peter Maxwell Davies, Emma Lou Diemer, Keith Emerson, George Gershwin, Alberto Ginastera, Philip Glass, Ferde Grofé, Yalil Guerra, Airat Ichmouratov, Aram Khachaturian, György Ligeti, Magnus Lindberg, Witold Lutosławski, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Frank Martin, Bohuslav Martinů, Nikolai Medtner, Peter Mennin, Peter Mieg, Selim Palmgren, Dora Pejačević, Willem Pijper, Francis Poulenc, Sergei Prokofiev, Behzad Ranjbaran, Einojuhani Rautavaara, Maurice Ravel, Alfred Schnittke, Arnold Schoenberg, Peter Sculthorpe, Peter Seabourne, Dmitri Shostakovich, Roger Smalley, Arthur Somervell, Igor Stravinsky, Heinrich Sutermeister, Alexander Tcherepnin, Michael Tippett, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Pancho Vladigerov, Charles Wuorinen, and others.

====Works for piano left-hand and orchestra====
The Austrian Paul Wittgenstein lost his right arm during World War I, and on resuming his musical career asked a number of composers to write pieces for him that required the left hand only. The Czech Otakar Hollmann, whose right arm was injured in the war, did likewise but to a lesser degree. The results of these commissions include concertante pieces for orchestra and piano left hand by Bortkiewicz, Britten, Hindemith, Janáček, Korngold, Martinů, Prokofiev, Ravel, Franz Schmidt, Richard Strauss, and others.

===Works for two or more pianists and orchestra===
Concertos and concert works for two solo pianos have been written by Johann Sebastian Bach (two to four pianos, BWV 1060–65, actually harpsichord concertos, but often performed on pianos), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (two, K 242 (originally for three pianos and orchestra) and K 365), Felix Mendelssohn (two, 1823–4), Max Bruch (1912), Béla Bartók (1927/1932, a reworking of his Sonata for two pianos and percussion), Francis Poulenc (1932), Arthur Bliss (1924), Arthur Benjamin (1938), Peter Mieg (1939–41), Darius Milhaud (1941 and 1951), Bohuslav Martinů (1943), Ralph Vaughan Williams (c. 1946), Roy Harris (1946), Gian Francesco Malipiero (two works, both 1957), Walter Piston (1959), Luciano Berio (1973), and Harald Genzmer (1990). Apart from the Bach and Mozart examples, works for more than two pianos and orchestra are considerably rarer, but have been written by Morton Gould (&quot;Inventions&quot; for four pianos and orchestra, 1954), Peter Racine Fricker (&quot;Concertante&quot; for three pianos, timpani, and strings, 1951), Wolfgang Fortner (&quot;Triplum&quot; for three pianos and orchestra, 1966) and Georg Friedrich Haas (&quot;limited approximations&quot; for six microtonally tuned pianos and orchestra, 2010).

The concerto for piano four hands is a rare genre, but Leopold Koželuch (1747–1818) wrote one (in B flat major, P IV: 8), and Alfred Schnittke (1934–1998) wrote another (in 1988).

==Characteristics==

===Form===
A classical piano concerto is often in three movements.

#A moderately quick opening movement in sonata allegro form often including a virtuoso cadenza (which may be improvised by the soloist).
#A slow movement that is freer and more expressive and lyrical. Usually in Ternary form.
#A faster rondo.

Examples by Mozart and Beethoven follow this model, but many others do not. Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4 includes a last-movement cadenza, and many other composers introduced innovations. For example, Liszt&#x27;s second and third concertos are played without breaks between the different sections, Brahms&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 and Liszt&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 have 4 movements and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 in E-flat major has only one (&quot;Allegro brillante&quot;).

<text>The prime minister of Jamaica () is Jamaica&#x27;s head of government, currently Andrew Holness. Holness, as leader of the governing Jamaica Labour Party (JLP), was sworn in as prime minister on 7 September 2020, having been re-elected as a result of the JLP&#x27;s landslide victory in the 2020 Jamaican general election.

The prime minister is formally appointed into office by the governor-general, who represents King Charles III.

==Official residence and office==

The prime minister of Jamaica&#x27;s official residence is Vale Royal. The property was constructed in 1694 by the planter Sir William Taylor, one of Jamaica&#x27;s richest men at the time. In 1928 the property was sold to the government and became the official residence of the British colonial secretary (then Sir Reginald Edward Stubbs). Vale Royal has subsequently become the official residence of the prime minister. Vale Royal is not open to the public.

 has been the location of the Office of the Prime Minister since 1972. Prime ministers resided there from 1964 until 1980. On 8 November 2022, Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in question time that his official residence was Jamaica House rather than Vale Royal and that Vale Royal was currently in disrepair and possible future uses would be considered after its restoration.

<doc id="306723" wikidata="Q44164" url="?curid=306723" title="Edge (wrestler)">
<text>Adam Joseph Copeland (born October 30, 1973) is a Canadian professional wrestler and actor. As a wrestler, he has been signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW) , where he performs under the ring name Cope (shortened from his real name, which he used early in AEW) and is a former two-time AEW TNT Champion. He is best known for his 25-year tenure in WWE from 1998 to 2023, where he performed under the ring name Edge.

Often regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, Copeland made his professional wrestling debut in 1992, wrestling in many independent promotions and competing in singles and tag team competition, the latter with long-time friend Christian Cage. In 1997, he signed a developmental deal with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, renamed WWE in 2002) and made his televised debut in 1998 under the ring name Edge. After winning the Intercontinental Championship in 1999, he formed a tag team with Christian, and the two won the World Tag Team Championship seven times. During this time, they gained notoriety due to their participation in Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches. They are considered one of the major teams that revived tag team wrestling during the Attitude Era. The team split in 2001 and Copeland embarked on a successful solo career. He won a total of 31 championships in WWE, holding the World Heavyweight Championship (2002–2013 version) a record 7 times, the WWE Championship 4 times, the Intercontinental Championship five times, the United States Championship once, the World Tag Team Championship a record 12 times, and the WWE Tag Team Championship twice. He is WWE&#x27;s 14th Triple Crown Champion and 7th Grand Slam Champion. He won the 2001 King of the Ring tournament, the first Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 21 in 2005, and the 2010 Royal Rumble match, making him the first wrestler to achieve all three.

Copeland first retired in 2011 due to several neck injuries and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame the next year. 9 years after retiring, he returned to wrestling as a surprise entrant in the 2020 Royal Rumble match and won the next year&#x27;s Royal Rumble, becoming the eighth man to win the Royal Rumble twice, the third to win it as the first entrant, and the first to win it after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. He headlined multiple pay-per-view (PPV) events for WWE, including WrestleMania XXIV and WrestleMania 37, being one of the company&#x27;s most prolific PPV performers. After his WWE contract expired in September 2023, he joined rival promotion AEW the next month, debuting in WrestleDream. He went on to win the AEW TNT Championship twice.

Aside from professional wrestling, Copeland has acted in the films &quot;&quot; (2000), &quot;Bending the Rules&quot; (2012) and &quot;Money Plane&quot; (2020). He has made guest appearances on TV shows such as &quot;Weakest Link&quot;, &quot;Mind of Mencia&quot;, &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, &quot;MADtv&quot;, and &quot;The Flash&quot;. He played Dwight Hendrickson on the Syfy series &quot;Haven&quot; (2011–2015), Ketill Flatnose in &quot;Vikings&quot; (2017–2020), and Ares in the Disney+ series &quot;Percy Jackson and the Olympians&quot; (2023–present).

== Early life ==
Adam Joseph Copeland was born in Orangeville, Ontario, on October 30, 1973, the son of Judy Lynn Copeland, a single mother who worked two jobs to support him. He has said he never met his father, or even saw a picture of him. He became interested in professional wrestling at a young age; his favorite wrestlers included Mr. Perfect, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, and Bret Hart. He met fellow future wrestler Jason Reso, known by his ring-name Christian Cage, in Orangeville when he was 10 years old, and they would make the trip to Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto to watch their favourite wrestlers; at the age of 16, Copeland attended WrestleMania VI at the Toronto SkyDome in 1990, sitting in the 11th row at ringside. He was cheering on WWF Champion Hulk Hogan against The Ultimate Warrior, and he credits this match with making him realize he wanted to be a wrestler. When he was 17, he won an essay writing contest hosted by his local gym, the prize for which was free wrestling training with Sweet Daddy Siki and Ron Hutchison in Toronto. However, he put his wrestling aspirations aside to help his mother pay the bills, taking numerous jobs and then receiving a diploma in radio broadcasting from Humber College before resuming his wrestling training.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1992–1995) ===
Copeland made his professional wrestling debut on Canada Day 1992, in an event at Monarch Park Stadium in Toronto. Throughout the 1990s, Copeland wrestled on the independent circuit in Ontario and the Great Lakes region of the United States under the ring name Sexton Hardcastle. He became a part of the tag team Sex and Violence with Joe E. Legend. In the mid-1990s, he wrestled as Adam Impact for Tony Condello&#x27;s Winnipeg promotion. In 1997, Sex and Violence became part of a larger stable called Thug Life, joining Christian Cage, Zakk Wyld, Bill Skullion, and Rhino Richards. During his independent career, he won the MWCW Tag Team Championship twice with Legend and the ICW Street Fight Tag Team Championship twice.

The duo of Hardcastle and Cage were known as Hard Impact before changing their name to the Suicide Blondes. They also worked in Japan under the name The Canadian Rockers. Copeland also wrestled as Damon Striker against Meng on an episode of &quot;WCW Pro&quot; in February 1996. (Copeland stated in 2021 the name was intended to be &quot;Damien Striker&quot;, but the on-screen caption of the name was incorrectly written.) In the summer of 1995, he worked a show in Ajax, Ontario, where Bret Hart&#x27;s business manager, Carl De Marco, was watching. Impressed, he suggested Copeland send an audition tape to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (1996–2023) ===

==== Early years (1996–1998) ====
On May 10, 1996, Copeland replaced Bob Holly&#x27;s opponent on short notice in the opening match of a WWF house show as Sexton Hardcastle in Hamilton, Ontario.

In 1996, Copeland initially made $210 per week while working for the WWF without an official contract. The company also paid for his outstanding college debt, which was around $40,000. After a Grand Prix Wrestling tour in the summer of 1997, De Marco urged Copeland to go to Calgary, where Hart was informally training wrestlers while recovering from knee surgery. He spent his tour earnings on a plane ticket and landed with no money or place to stay. He called Johnny Smith, whom he met twice, and Smith agreed to give him food and shelter. Smith also drove Copeland to and from the gym and Hart&#x27;s house, where he trained alongside Ken Shamrock, Test, Mark Henry and Kurrgan. Copeland returned to the Maritimes for another Grand Prix tour before going back to Hart&#x27;s house, bringing Christian with him. After this camp, Hart was impressed enough to put in a good word for both men at the WWF.

Copeland received a developmental contract with the WWF in 1997. His first match was on November 10, 1997, in Ottawa, Ontario losing to CFL football star Glen Kulka. The next day in Cornwall, Ontario, he faced and defeated Christian Cage at &quot;Shotgun&quot; taping in a dark match, this match is included on WWE Home Video&#x27;s 2008 retrospective, &quot;Edge: A Decade of Decadence&quot;. From March to June 1998, Copeland appeared in many house shows and dark matches. Upon completing his training, Copeland made his WWF television debut on the June 22, 1998 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as Edge. Copeland took the name Edge from an Albany radio station.

Edge&#x27;s first televised match was on June 16 (aired June 22) against Jose Estrada Jr., which ended prematurely by countout when Edge performed a somersault senton from the ring to the outside, legitimately injuring Estrada&#x27;s neck. In his first pay-per-view match at SummerSlam on August 30, he served as Sable&#x27;s mystery tag team partner defeating Jacqueline and Marc Mero, and slammed Sable onto Mero in a pinning position to pick up the win. At on September 27, Edge faced Owen Hart in a losing effort making it his first loss on WWF TV. On the October 11 edition of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, Edge defeated Vader in Vader&#x27;s final televised WWF match and at WWF Capital Carnage on December 6, Edge faced Tiger Ali Singh in a losing effort.

==== Teaming with Christian (1998–2001) ====
Edge was then placed in a feud against the vampire wrestler Gangrel. During the feud, Gangrel introduced Christian, Edge&#x27;s storyline brother, as his ally. Eventually, Gangrel and Christian convinced Edge to join them, and the three of them formed an alliance known as The Brood.

At Rock Bottom: In Your House on December 13, The Brood defeated The J.O.B. Squad in a six-man tag team match. At the Royal Rumble on January 24, 1999, Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match and was eliminated by Road Dogg. The Brood was later abducted and converted into The Undertaker&#x27;s Ministry of Darkness. In May 1999, the Brood broke away from the Ministry after Christian was attacked by Ken Shamrock and forced to reveal the location of the captive Stephanie McMahon. The Undertaker chose to have Christian punished for his trespass, but Edge and Gangrel stood by him and betrayed The Undertaker, leading to a brief feud with the Ministry. At on April 25, the Brood faced Ministry members Bradshaw, Faarooq, and Mideon in a losing effort. At King of the Ring on June 27, The Hardy Boyz defeated Edge and Christian in a match to determine the number one contender to the WWF Tag Team Championship, after their first match on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; ended in a no-contest.
Edge captured his first singles championship, the WWF Intercontinental Championship, on July 24, 1999, defeating Jeff Jarrett at a house show in Toronto, Ontario. Interestingly, the match wasn&#x27;t booked this way. Edge explained in an interview in 2021 with Loudwire: &quot;During the match we did this thing where I pinned [Jeff Jarrett] and the crowd thought I won and then they were gonna reverse it, but then Jack Lanza, who was the road agent at the time, walked out and said, ‘Go get your belt.’ I went, ‘Whaaaa?’ We&#x27;re calling an audible here!”

He lost the title the next night to Jarrett at Fully Loaded on July 25. At SummerSlam on August 22, Edge and Christian competed in a Tag team turmoil match where they eliminated three teams: The Hardy Boyz, Mideon and Viscera, and Droz and Prince Albert before getting eliminated from the match by The Acolytes. At Unforgiven on September 26, Edge and Christian faced The New Age Outlaws for the WWF Tag Team Championship but failed to win the titles.

Later in the year, he was placed in a storyline angle with The Hardy Boyz. Gangrel soon betrayed both Edge and Christian and formed The New Brood with their enemies, The Hardy Boyz. They feuded with the Hardy Boyz, as they went on to compete in a ladder match at No Mercy on October 17 for the &quot;managerial services&quot; of Terri Runnels and $100,000, which the Hardy Boyz won. The match was widely praised and described as the match of the year by various reviewers. At Survivor Series on November 14, Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz faced Too Cool and The Hollys in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match where they lost. At Armageddon on December 12, Edge and Christian competed in an 8-team battle royal which was won by The Acolytes. At the Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, Edge competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by Al Snow and Val Venis. At No Way Out on February 27, Edge and Christian defeated The Hardy Boyz in a tag team match to determine the number one contenders to the WWF Tag Team Championship. At WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, Edge and Christian defeated the Hardy Boyz and the Dudley Boyz to win the WWF Tag Team Championship in a Triangle Ladder match, which ultimately led to the creation of the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match.

At Backlash on April 30, Edge and Christian defeated D-Generation X to retain the titles. At Judgment Day on May 21, Edge, Christian and Kurt Angle lost a six-man tag team match to Rikishi and Too Cool. Soon after, they lost the tag titles to Too Cool but won them back in a Four corners elimination match at King of the Ring on June 25. At Fully Loaded on July 23, they defended the titles against The Acolytes Protection Agency where they got disqualified but retained the titles. After retaining the titles at SummerSlam on August 27, at Unforgiven on September 24, Edge and Christian defended the titles against The Hardy Boyz in a steel cage match where they lost the titles and were not allowed another title shot. At No Mercy on October 22, Edge and Christian, masked as Los Conquistadores, defeated The Hardys for the titles. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, the Hardy Boyz dressed as the Los Conquistadores and defeated Edge in a handicap match after Christian was taken out backstage to regain the WWF Tag Team Championship.

At Survivor Series on November 19, Edge and Christian teamed with Right to Censor&#x27;s Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match, where they lost to The Dudley Boyz and The Hardy Boyz, They regained the tag titles at Armageddon on December 10 in a fatal four-way match, but lost them eight days later to The Rock and The Undertaker. They won them back three days later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; thanks to special guest referee Kurt Angle. During Edge and Christian&#x27;s run as a tag team, they also competed as a team in the first three TLC matches, winning the first two over The Dudley Boyz and The Hardy Boyz, at SummerSlam in 2000 and then again at WrestleMania X-Seven. At the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001, Edge and Christian were defeated by the Dudley Boyz and lost the tag team titles. They unsuccessfully attempted to regain the tag team title at No Way Out on February 25 against the Dudley Boyz and The Brothers of Destruction, but they succeeded at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1 against the Dudley Boyz and The Hardyz in the second TLC match. At Judgment Day on May 20, Edge and Christian competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match which was won by Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. Days later on the May 24 &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Edge and Christian competed in a Fatal 4-Way Tag Team TLC Match for the WWF Tag Team Championship where Benoit and Jericho retained the titles.

==== Championship reigns and various feuds (2001–2003) ====
Edge solidified himself as an emerging singles competitor by winning the 2001 King of the Ring tournament and slowly becoming a fan favourite by siding with the WWF during the Invasion storyline. Christian betrayed Edge shortly afterward, and the two feuded over Edge&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship (which he won at SummerSlam on August 19) that he later lost to Christian at Unforgiven on September 23, though Edge later captured the title in a ladder match at No Mercy on October 21.

Edge lost the Intercontinental Championship to Test on the November 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and shortly afterwards won the WCW United States Championship from Kurt Angle on the November 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Edge defeated Test at Survivor Series on November 18 to regain the Intercontinental Championship which he unified with the United States Championship. From there, Edge was placed in a feud with William Regal for the Intercontinental Championship. Edge first defeated Regal at Vengeance on December 9 to retain the championship: however, he would come up short in the new year, losing the title to Regal at the Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002, and then coming up short in his rematch against Regal at No Way Out on February 17 in a Brass Knuckles on a Pole match. At WrestleMania X8 on March 17, Edge found himself in a match with Booker T that was the result of Edge beating out Booker T for a fictitious Japanese shampoo endorsement. Shortly after defeating Booker T at WrestleMania, Edge was drafted to the SmackDown! brand in the first WWF Draft Lottery. During this time, Edge also gained &quot;Never Gonna Stop (The Red Red Kroovy)&quot; by Rob Zombie as his new entrance theme.

Upon arriving there, he began a feud with Kurt Angle. At Backlash on April 21, Angle defeated Edge which later culminated in Edge shaving Angle&#x27;s head following a hair vs. hair match at Judgment Day on May 19. On the May 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Edge defeated Angle in a steel cage match to end the feud. During the match, Edge speared Angle from the top rope, injuring his own arm and forcing himself out of action for a month. Two months later, he would end up winning the WWE Tag Team Championship alongside Hollywood Hulk Hogan on the July 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; by defeating Billy and Chuck. Edge and Hogan lost the titles at Vengeance on July 21 to The Un-Americans (Lance Storm and Christian), and at SummerSlam on August 25, Edge defeated Eddie Guerrero then lost to Guerrero at Unforgiven on September 22. They met one final time days later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in a No Disqualification match where Edge won, ending the feud. He then formed a tag team with Rey Mysterio, and the two participated in a tournament for the newly created and &quot;SmackDown!&quot; exclusive WWE Tag Team Championship. They lost to Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit in the finals of the tournament at No Mercy on October 20; the match was voted Match of the Year by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. After they failed in winning the titles, Mysterio and Edge defeated Los Guerreros in a number one contender&#x27;s match on the October 24 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to earn a title shot. At the Rebellion pay-per-view on October 26, Edge faced Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman in a Handicap match for the WWE Championship where Lesnar retained the title after Lesnar pinned Edge. On the November 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, they defeated Angle and Benoit in a two out-of-three falls match to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. They soon lost the tag titles to Los Guerreros in a triple threat elimination match that also involved former champions Angle and Benoit at Survivor Series on November 17.

After losing the title, Edge and Mysterio went their separate ways to focus on their singles careers. At the Royal Rumble, Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match on January 19, 2003, where he had three eliminations before getting eliminated by Chris Jericho. Edge then teamed up with Chris Benoit, facing Team Angle in a series of singles and tag team matches. Prior to No Way Out, Edge suffered a legitimate neck injury, rendering him unable to compete in his scheduled match. The injury stemmed from a bump he took on a closed ladder on the September 26, 2002 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; while wrestling Eddie Guerrero, who then frog-splashed him while he was still laying on the ladder. His arms would then numb more and more in the following months before deciding to have the surgery, as he was gradually in more pain and did not want to risk dropping an opponent dangerously because of his numb arms. At No Way Out on February 23, Edge was written off television through a backstage attack. He then underwent surgery with Dr. Lloyd Youngblood and was sidelined for over a year.

==== World championship pursuits (2004–2005) ====
Edge was drafted to the Raw brand in the 2004 WWE draft lottery on March 22, 2004, where he speared Eric Bischoff and returned to in-ring action shortly after the event. At Backlash on April 18, Edge defeated Kane, and on the April 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he and World Heavyweight Champion Chris Benoit won the World Tag Team Championship from Batista and Ric Flair. They continued a close partnership even after losing the title; at Bad Blood on June 13, Edge and Benoit defeated La Résistance (who defeated them for the titles on the May 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;) in a match for the World Tag Team Championship by disqualification but did not win the titles. The team disbanded when Edge won the Intercontinental Championship at Vengeance on July 11 defeating Randy Orton, thus becoming a five time Intercontinental Champion. At SummerSlam on August 15, Edge defeated Chris Jericho and Batista in a triple threat match to retain the Intercontinental Championship. Following a legitimate groin injury in a non-televised match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff stripped Edge of the Intercontinental title on the September 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

Upon his return, Edge began to pursue the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge, Chris Benoit, and Shawn Michaels received a title shot for Triple H&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship at Taboo Tuesday on October 19. Michaels won the audience vote to receive the title shot, giving Edge and Benoit a tag team title shot against La Résistance. They regained the titles. During the match, an angry Edge abandoned Benoit and instead interfered in the World Heavyweight Championship match, costing Michaels the championship. On the November 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge and Benoit lost the World Tag Team Championship back to La Résistance with Edge abandoning Benoit again and sitting in a chair and watching the match. After the conclusion of the match, Edge attacked Benoit, turning heel for the first time since 2001. Edge would also gain a new entrance theme, &quot;Metalingus&quot;, performed by the then-newly established band, Alter Bridge. At Survivor Series on November 14, Edge was part of Team Triple H along with Triple H, Batista, and Gene Snitsky. They were defeated by Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven). During the match, Edge eliminated both Benoit and Jericho before getting eliminated by Orton.

On the November 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, both Edge and Benoit competed in a number one contender&#x27;s battle royal, but they eliminated each other simultaneously at the conclusion of the match, resulting in a draw. As a result, Triple H was forced to defend the title in a triple threat match. In the match, Benoit locked the Crippler Crossface on Edge, who shifted his weight putting Benoit&#x27;s shoulders on the mat for a pin. This match also ended in a draw for Benoit and Edge, as Benoit made Edge submit at the same time the referee counted a pinfall for Edge. As a result, the World Heavyweight title was vacated the following week on &quot;Raw&quot;. On January 9, 2005, Edge competed in his first Elimination Chamber match at New Year&#x27;s Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. Special guest referee Shawn Michaels performed a superkick on Edge, in retaliation for an accidental spear by Edge, causing Edge to be the first eliminated. This led to a match at the Royal Rumble on January 30, in which Edge defeated Michaels. Edge also competed in the Royal Rumble match later that night, where he lasted until the final three but was eliminated by eventual winner Batista and John Cena.

==== WWE Champion (2005–2006) ====
At WrestleMania 21 on April 3, Edge won the first ever Money in the Bank ladder match, gaining a contract that gave him a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship within one year. According to a podcast interview with Chris Jericho, Copeland said that he did not initially like the idea of the ladder match and even told WWE management not to include him on the WrestleMania 21 card altogether. However, he was talked into competing by the other participants like Jericho and Glenn Jacobs who said the match had the potential to be a big success. At Backlash on May 1, Edge defeated Chris Benoit in a Last Man Standing match to end the feud. Several weeks after, Edge was then paired with Lita, his real-life girlfriend at the time, in an angle in which she betrayed her storyline husband Kane, by costing him the Gold Rush tournament finals match to determine the number-one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship on the May 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. The next week, Edge received his World Heavyweight Championship match against Batista, which he lost. Edge started a feud with Kane leading to several matches between them including one at Vengeance on June 26, when Edge lost to Kane. After trading several victories on &quot;Raw&quot;, the feud ended in a stretcher match on the July 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; that Edge won, but shortly after, Kane performed a tombstone piledriver on Lita and later abducted her in an ambulance.

On the July 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge&#x27;s match with Kane was interrupted when Matt Hardy made a surprise appearance. Hardy referred to Edge by his real name and issued a threat to Lita as well. When Hardy was officially brought back to Raw, he and Edge continued their feud, including a match at SummerSlam on August 21 where Edge defeated Hardy, causing Hardy to have excessive blood loss. A week later on &quot;Raw&quot;, after a match Hardy had with Rob Conway, Edge then appeared and overpowered Hardy. He then wedged Hardy&#x27;s head between the steel steps and the ringpost, and then kicked the steel steps into Hardy&#x27;s head. On the August 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge and Hardy fought in a Street Fight, which resulted in a no contest when Hardy performed a side effect on Edge off the entrance ramp into the sound speakers and other electrical equipment. They also fought in a Steel cage match at Unforgiven on September 18 in which Hardy defeated Edge. The feud culminated in a Loser Leaves Raw ladder match on &quot;Raw Homecoming&quot; on October 3, which Edge won. After the match, Hardy left the Raw brand to go to the SmackDown! brand, while Edge suffered a legit torn pectoralis major muscle that kept him shelved for a couple of months. During his time off, he starred in his own talk show segment on Raw entitled &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot;, dubbing himself the &quot;Rated-R Superstar&quot;. Edge used his talk show to start a feud with Ric Flair following Flair&#x27;s well-publicized arrest in connection with a road rage incident. Edge eventually began using &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; as a soapbox to run down Flair until, after weeks of public mockery, Flair eventually showed up and attacked Edge. Edge and Flair formally met at the New Year&#x27;s Revolution event on January 8, 2006, in a match for Flair&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship, which resulted in Flair retaining after Edge was disqualified.

Although Edge had lost his scheduled match at New Year&#x27;s Revolution, that would not be his only match that evening as the main event saw John Cena, the reigning WWE Champion, defend his title in an Elimination Chamber match. After a bloody Cena won the match, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon revealed that Edge was cashing in his Money in the Bank contract to face Cena for the championship immediately. After two spears, Edge quickly defeated Cena to win the WWE Championship, marking his first world title win.

The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge decided to celebrate his victory by having &quot;hot, unbridled sex&quot; in the middle of the ring. He and Lita engaged in foreplay until they were interrupted by Flair, who called Edge a disgrace and &quot;that he was horrible in the sack&quot;. Flair, however, ended up on the receiving end of a con-chair-to on the announcers&#x27; table until Cena came out to Flair&#x27;s aid and performed an FU on Lita. The &quot;Live Sex Celebration&quot; segment earned &quot;Raw&quot; a 5.2 rating, the highest &quot;Raw&quot; rating in over a year, leading Edge to call himself the &quot;most watched champion ever&quot;. On the January 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge defeated Ric Flair in a TLC match to retain the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble on January 29, Edge lost the WWE Championship back to Cena.

Edge then lost a rematch on the February 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and blamed special guest referee Mick Foley for his loss. They feuded until WrestleMania 22 on April 2, where Edge defeated Foley in a hardcore match by Spearing him through a flaming table but suffered second degree burns, thanks to anti-flame material not being applied to the table, at both wrestlers&#x27; request. According to Copeland, the match with Foley proved him as a main eventer. After losing a triple threat match at Backlash for the WWE Championship, Edge teamed with Foley, pointing as Hardcore Champions. At ECW One Night Stand on June 11, Edge, Foley and Lita defeated Dreamer, Terry Funk and Beulah McGillicutty in an Extreme Rules tag team match. Later in the event, Edge interfered in the WWE Championship match between John Cena and challenger Rob Van Dam, helping Van Dam win the title after he speared Cena through a table.
While Edge lost a match for the WWE title at Vengeance, he won the championship on the July 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; during a triple threat match. This angle re-ignited Edge&#x27;s feud with Cena, retaining the title against him at SummerSlam. The night after SummerSlam, Lita disposed of Cena&#x27;s customized &quot;spinner&quot; belt into the Long Island Sound and he unveiled the new &quot;Rated-R&quot; version of the belt. Edge lost the title to Cena in a TLC match at Unforgiven, a PPV that took place in Edge&#x27;s hometown of Toronto.

==== Rated-RKO (2006–2007) ====
On the October 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, interference from the newly reformed D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) cost Edge his &quot;final chance&quot; at John Cena&#x27;s WWE Championship in a Steel cage match, though their interference was a response to the interference of Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch. It led to Edge approaching Randy Orton and asking him to join forces to defeat DX, which Orton accepted and joined an alliance with Edge. The two formed the tag team Rated-RKO. At Cyber Sunday on November 5, Rated-RKO defeated DX with Eric Bischoff as the special guest referee. On the November 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Rated-RKO defeated Ric Flair and Roddy Piper to win the World Tag Team Championship, making Edge a record eleven-time tag team champion. At Survivor Series on November 26, Rated-RKO teamed with Johnny Nitro, Mike Knox and Gregory Helms to face Team DX (Triple H, Shawn Michaels, CM Punk, Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) in a Survivor Series match, but lost when all members of Team Rated-RKO were eliminated in a clean sweep. Also that month, Lita retired, and her on-screen relationship with Edge abruptly ended, with no explanation.

As part of the storyline angle, Rated-RKO attacked Ric Flair with steel chairs to enrage DX on the November 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. At New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 7, 2007, Rated-RKO defended the World Tag Team Championship against DX, but the match was declared a no-contest when Triple H suffered a legitimate injury during the match. At the Royal Rumble on January 28, Edge competed in the 30-man Royal Rumble match where he lasted the longest in the match with a time of 44 minutes, eliminating 5 men and making it to the final 4 in the match before getting eliminated by Shawn Michaels. With Triple H out of action, the team continued their on-screen rivalry with remaining DX member Shawn Michaels. Michaels teamed with John Cena to defeat Rated-RKO for the World Tag Team Championship on January 29, 2007. Edge and Orton suffered a series of losses to Cena and Michaels in the following months. Edge competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23 on April 1 in a losing effort. During the match, Matt Hardy threw him onto a ladder and encouraged Jeff Hardy, who was close to the winning briefcase, to finish him off. Hardy then leaped off the 20-foot-high (6.1 m) ladder, and drove him through the ladder with a leg drop, seemingly injuring both Edge and himself. The two were unable to continue the match and were removed from ringside on stretchers. After this Edge and Orton also became rivals in their goals of achieving the WWE Championship. Neither Edge nor Orton won the championship, and they lost their claims as number one contenders after a failed match with Cena at Backlash on April 29.

==== La Familia (2007–2009) ====

On the May 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge interrupted an in-ring promo by the winner of the 2007 Money in the Bank contract, Mr. Kennedy. Kennedy had said for weeks that he would not cash in the contract until the following WrestleMania, but Edge decided to goad him into a match for his briefcase. Edge attacked Kennedy before the match even started, severely injuring his shoulder, and took advantage of the injury to beat Kennedy and take the briefcase. Edge thus became the first person to gain the Money in the Bank contract twice and the first not to do so in the ladder match.

On the May 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in Pittsburgh, World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker retained his title against Batista in a steel cage match. Then, Mark Henry attacked The Undertaker. Despite being part of the Raw roster, Edge would appear and cash in his Money in the Bank contract on The Undertaker. After one spear, Edge pinned The Undertaker for the victory and his first World Heavyweight Championship. As a result, Edge became a member of the SmackDown! roster. Edge then began a feud with Batista and successfully defended his championship title against him at Judgment Day on May 20, in a Steel Cage match at One Night Stand on June 3, and a third and final time by countout in a last chance match at on June 24. Edge then began a feud with Kane after SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long announced Kane as the new number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at The Great American Bash. Edge was forced to relinquish the World Heavyweight Championship due to a legitimately torn left pectoral muscle injury on the July 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; following an attack by Kane a week earlier.
On November 18, at Survivor Series, Edge made his return, interfering in a World Heavyweight Championship Hell in a Cell match between Batista and The Undertaker, helping Batista win the match. The following &quot;SmackDown!&quot; show saw Edge and General Manager Vickie Guerrero make their relationship public, making his official in-ring return in a World Heavyweight Championship match against Batista on the November 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, a match that ended after The Undertaker interfered. At Armageddon, Edge won his second World Heavyweight Championship, after giving The Undertaker two chair shots and pinning the defending champion Batista (who had been Tombstoned by The Undertaker prior) in a Triple Threat match. During the match, Edge used two look-a-likes to distract Batista and The Undertaker. It was later revealed that these look-a-likes were the Major Brothers, who were then repackaged as Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder. Edge also formed an alliance with Chavo Guerrero, nephew of Vickie Guerrero, and on the January 22, 2008 broadcast of &quot;ECW&quot;, he assisted Chavo in winning the ECW Championship from CM Punk. This group eventually came under the name of La Familia (Spanish for &quot;The Family&quot;). Edge then successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship over Rey Mysterio at the Royal Rumble and again at No Way Out in February. Also that month, he proposed to Vickie, which she accepted.
At WrestleMania XXIV in March, Edge lost the World Heavyweight Championship to The Undertaker when he tapped out to the Hell&#x27;s Gate. The match was booked for Edge to retain and break the streak, but Edge refused to break the streak, stating in an interview that it made zero sense, he was already a made man, and that he was already in the main event of WrestleMania and that was good enough for him. In a WrestleMania rematch, The Undertaker defeated Edge once again at Backlash to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Following Backlash, The Undertaker was stripped of the World Heavyweight Championship by Vickie Guerrero for using the Hell&#x27;s Gate, which she previously banned. After winning a tournament to determine who would face The Undertaker for the vacant championship, the two met at Judgment Day, which ended in Edge losing via countout. However, since championships cannot change hands via countout, no champion was crowned. A rematch was scheduled for One Night Stand, in a TLC match. On the May 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Vickie Guerrero added a stipulation that stated if The Undertaker were to lose, he would be kayfabe banished from the WWE. At One Night Stand on June 1, Edge would defeat The Undertaker after interference from La Familia, Chavo Guerrero and Bam Neely, winning the World Heavyweight Championship for the third time. Since he lost, The Undertaker was also forced to leave the company.

On June 29, Edge retained his championship against Batista at Night of Champions, after interference from La Familia. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge appeared to gloat that two of the top championships were on SmackDown, as WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to SmackDown in the WWE draft earlier that week. A vengeful Batista then appeared and incapacitated Edge with the Batista Bomb. Just as Batista was leaving, CM Punk ran to the ring carrying his Money in the Bank briefcase, with referee in tow, who then cashed in the briefcase. Edge, who was still knocked down from the attack by Batista, was easily pinned by Punk after a Go To Sleep, losing the World Heavyweight Championship. Due to this win, the championship became exclusive to the Raw brand.

On the July 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge took his frustrations out on Vickie because he lost the title and told her the wedding was off. The following week, however, after Guerrero saved Edge from a con-chair-to by The Big Show, Edge re-proposed, and the wedding was back on. On the July 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, at the wedding reception, Triple H came out and showed a video of Edge cheating on Guerrero the day before with the wedding planner, Alicia Fox. At The Great American Bash on July 20, Edge faced Triple H for the WWE Championship in a losing effort. Edge attempted to apologize to Guerrero, but she revealed to him that she had rehired The Undertaker and that Edge would face him in a Hell in a Cell match at SummerSlam. Edge then turned on La Familia during the August 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, performing a one-man con-chair-to on Chavo Guerrero in the ring, and tossed Vickie out of her wheelchair, effectively disbanding the faction. At SummerSlam on August 17, The Undertaker defeated Edge, and after the match, The Undertaker chokeslammed Edge off the top of a ladder and through the ring canvas, with flames rising from the hole.
On November 23, at Survivor Series, Edge returned to WWE after an introduction by SmackDown General Manager and his on-screen wife Vickie Guerrero, replacing Jeff Hardy in the Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship involving champion Triple H and Vladimir Kozlov. He pinned Triple H to become the WWE Champion for the third time in his career. Edge lost the title to Hardy at Armageddon on December 14 in a triple threat match, which also featured Triple H. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2009, however, Edge regained the title in a no disqualification match, following Matt Hardy&#x27;s interference. At No Way Out on February 15, Edge lost the WWE Championship in an Elimination Chamber match after being pinned by Jeff Hardy, being the first to be eliminated, with the title eventually being won by Triple H. Later that night, Edge inserted himself into the World Heavyweight Championship Elimination Chamber match after attacking Kofi Kingston and barricading himself inside one of the chamber&#x27;s pods, proceeding to win his fourth World Heavyweight Championship, last eliminating Rey Mysterio and taking the title over to SmackDown. At WrestleMania 25 on April 5, Edge lost the championship to John Cena in a Triple Threat match, which also included Big Show, but regained the championship for a fifth time at Backlash on April 26, when he defeated Cena in a Last Man Standing match, after interference by Big Show. After a successful defense against Jeff Hardy at Judgment Day on May 17, he lost the title to Hardy at Extreme Rules on June 7 in a ladder match. While Hardy was celebrating, CM Punk cashed in his Money in the Bank and defeated Hardy to win the World Heavyweight Championship. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Guerrero resigned as the Raw General Manager due to being humiliated, and Edge came out to apologize. Instead, however, he confessed he married Guerrero only because she had authoritative powers as the General Manager, and sought a divorce. On the June 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge received his rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat match against both Hardy and Punk, but was pinned by Punk.

Edge won the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship (the unified version of the World Tag Team Championship from the Raw brand and the WWE Tag Team Championship from the SmackDown brand) with Chris Jericho at The Bash on June 28 after he and Jericho were inserted into what was originally a match between reigning champions The Colóns and Legacy. The win made Edge a record-setting 12 time World Tag Team Champion. On July 3, Edge suffered a torn Achilles tendon while competing at a live event in San Diego in a match against Jeff Hardy, and later underwent surgery. It was reported that he could be out of action for up to a year. During Edge&#x27;s absence, Jericho replaced him with Big Show (forming Jeri-Show) and Jericho began to speak badly of Edge, mocking him for his injury.

==== Record-breaking World Heavyweight Champion (2010–2011) ====
At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view event on January 31, 2010, Edge returned from injury by entering the Royal Rumble match as the twenty-ninth surprise entrant, where he won the Royal Rumble match for the first time in his career, after last eliminating John Cena. At Elimination Chamber on February 21, after Chris Jericho won the World Heavyweight Championship, Edge challenged Jericho for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXVI after a surprise attack on Jericho, turning face for the first time since 2004. At WrestleMania on March 28, Edge failed to win the title. Edge defeated Jericho in a steel cage match at Extreme Rules on April 25, ending their feud.

On April 26, as part of 2010 WWE draft, Edge was drafted to the Raw brand, also costing Randy Orton a title shot, by spearing him in a triple threat match against Batista and Sheamus. On the April 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge said goodbye to the SmackDown fans. However, Edge turned on the fans by calling them &quot;puppets&quot; for chanting for him and later tried a sneak attack on his former tag team partner Christian, thus turning heel once again. Edge began a feud with Randy Orton, with both Edge and Orton gaining the upper hand over one another. Much of the antagonism stemmed of Orton&#x27;s refusal to re-form Rated-RKO with Edge, as Edge wanted to pursue the tag team titles he had been stripped of. Edge and Orton met in a match at the Over the Limit pay-per-view on May 23, with the match resulting in a double countout. At Fatal 4-Way on June 20, Edge participated in a fatal four-way match that also included Orton, John Cena, and Sheamus for the WWE Championship, though Edge failed to win the title. Edge then participated in the Raw Money in the Bank ladder match at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view on July 18, but failed to win the briefcase, as it was won by The Miz. Edge then went on to participate in the main event of SummerSlam on August 15 in a seven-on-seven elimination tag team match against The Nexus. Although he was eliminated by Heath Slater, his team was victorious. On the 900th episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge disqualified himself in the main event in a five-on-five elimination match against The Nexus. This saw him enter into a feud with the anonymous Raw General Manager, during which the general manager cost him several matches. At Night of Champions on September 19, Edge participated in a six-pack elimination challenge for the WWE Championship, but once again failed to win the title.

At the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view on October 3, Edge defeated Jack Swagger. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, he was traded back to SmackDown for CM Punk, due to him destroying the Anonymous Raw General Manager&#x27;s computer, turning face once again . On the October 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, he defeated Dolph Ziggler to become part of Team SmackDown at Bragging Rights. At Bragging Rights on October 24, Edge won the match for Team SmackDown alongside Rey Mysterio, eliminating R-Truth, John Morrison and The Miz.

On the October 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge defeated Rey Mysterio and Alberto Del Rio to become the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series. On the November 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge lost his match with David Otunga, thanks to Paul Bearer&#x27;s interference. Edge then kidnapped Bearer and used him to cost Kane his match with Big Show. The following week, Edge tortured Paul Bearer, forcing him to play dodgeball and force-feeding him, planning to wear down Kane. He then ambushed Kane in the garage when he was a few feet from Paul Bearer and drove away with his hostage. At Survivor Series on November 21, Edge failed to win the title after the referee determined the match a draw, due to both men pinning each other at the same time. On December 19, 2010, Edge defeated Kane, Rey Mysterio, and Alberto Del Rio in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at to win the World Heavyweight Championship for a record sixth time and making him a ten time World Champion. Edge then defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Kane in a winning effort in a Last Man Standing match on the January 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, thus ending their feud.
At the Royal Rumble on January 30, 2011, Edge successfully defended his World Heavyweight Championship against Dolph Ziggler. On the 600th episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; on February 18, acting General Manager Guerrero fired Edge in storyline, and awarded the World Heavyweight Championship to her on-screen boyfriend Ziggler. SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long returned later that night, and rehired Edge. Edge then defeated Ziggler to become the World Heavyweight Champion for the record seventh and final time, his 11th world championship overall. At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view on February 20, Edge successfully defended his World Heavyweight Championship in an Elimination Chamber match by finally pinning Rey Mysterio. After he won the match, he was attacked by Royal Rumble winner Alberto Del Rio, but was saved by the returning Christian. Edge and Christian briefly reunited to defeat Del Rio and his bodyguard Brodus Clay on the March 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. At WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, Edge successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Del Rio.

==== First retirement and WWE Hall of Famer (2011–2019) ====
On the April 11, 2011, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge gave an emotional speech about his career and the realities of wrestling. He reflected upon his previous neck injury and cervical vertebral fusion, and stated that he had felt numbness in his arms. He passed basic-strength tests prior to WrestleMania, but WWE had urged him for further testing and an MRI result forced him to retire. This was diagnosed as cervical spinal stenosis, and doctors would not clear him to compete, for risk of neck-down paralysis or even death should he take a hard enough fall. Later that same week, on the April 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge officially relinquished the World Heavyweight Championship, retiring as the World Heavyweight Champion while recapping his announcement and expressing gratitude over this happening now rather than when it was too late.

On the April 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge interrupted Alberto Del Rio&#x27;s mock retirement party for him. At Extreme Rules on May 1, Edge helped his friend Christian defeat Del Rio in a ladder match to win the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. At SummerSlam on August 14, Edge was in Christian&#x27;s corner for his World Heavyweight Championship defense against Randy Orton but, disappointed by the cowardly tactics Christian used to win his second World Heavyweight Championship, berated him and walked out on him. Christian then lost the title to Orton for a second time. On the September 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, in his hometown of Toronto, Edge hosted &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; between Mark Henry and the World Heavyweight Champion, Randy Orton. After the show went off the air, they held &quot;Edge Appreciation Night&quot; to celebrate his career.

On March 31, 2012, Edge was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Christian, during WrestleMania XXVIII weekend. Edge made a surprise appearance on the April 23, 2012 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, confronting his long-time rival John Cena about Brock Lesnar. On the September 21, 2012 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge made an appearance addressing Team Hell No. Edge returned on the September 9, 2013, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in his hometown of Toronto where he hosted his talk show &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; having Daniel Bryan as his special guest.

Edge insulted Triple H in the segment, who retaliated by sending The Shield to attack Edge&#x27;s friend Christian. Later that week, Edge hosted &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; on the September 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, where he mocked Randy Orton and watched as Orton&#x27;s attack on Bryan backfired. Edge and Christian hosted the December 29, 2014 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where they held the first ever &quot;Cutting Edge Peep Show&quot; interviewing Seth Rollins, who, along with Big Show, attacked them. Rollins held Edge hostage, thus forcing John Cena to reinstate the Authority. When Rollins tried to break Edge&#x27;s neck anyway, Cena ended up making the save. Edge would return on the January 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; and with The Authority back in power, apologized to the pair for the Seth Rollins attack.

Edge and Christian appeared in a backstage segment on the September 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where they were seen playing their trademark kazoos after a confrontation with Rollins. They would later become involved in an altercation with The New Day and The Dudley Boyz. In 2016, Edge and Christian began hosting the WWE Network Show, &quot;The Edge and Christian Show That Totally Reeks of Awesomeness&quot;, a second season would eventually go on to air.

On February 15, 2016, it was announced Edge and Christian would host an installment of &quot;The Cutting Edge Peep Show&quot; at Fastlane with The New Day as their special guests. At the event, Edge and Christian joined forces with The New Day against The League of Nations with The New Day completing a &#x27;Face turn&#x27;. On November 15, 2016, on the 900th episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge hosted a special edition of &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; with the men&#x27;s SmackDown Survivor Series team members as his guests and was later interrupted by the returning Undertaker. He later reunited with his &#x27;Edgeheads&#x27; Zack Ryder and Curt Hawkins. Edge was present at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony in 2017 as his wife Beth Phoenix was inducted. On April 7, 2018, Edge and Christian inducted the Dudley Boyz into the WWE Hall of Fame. Later that year on October 16 at the 1,000th episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge hosted &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; with SmackDown Women&#x27;s Champion Becky Lynch as his guest.

At the SummerSlam pay-per-view event on August 11, 2019, Edge interrupted Elias&#x27; performance and performed a spear on him, engaging in physical wrestling for the first time since his retirement. This sparked rumours that Edge had been medically cleared to wrestle, which he denied.

==== In-ring return and Universal Championship pursuits (2020–2022) ====
At the 2020 Royal Rumble on January 26, Edge entered the Men&#x27;s Royal Rumble match at the number 21 spot to the loudest crowd reaction of the show, competing in his first professional wrestling match after a nine-year retirement. He eliminated three participants, including former teammate Randy Orton, before being eliminated by Roman Reigns. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge was attacked by Orton, leading to a Last Man Standing match between them on the second night of WrestleMania 36 on April 5, which Edge won. They had another match at Backlash on June 14, where Orton was victorious. During the match, Edge suffered a torn triceps and it was reported that the injury would sideline him for four to eight months. After a seven-month hiatus, Edge returned on the January 25, 2021 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he declared that he would enter the 2021 Royal Rumble match, which he won after entering first, by last eliminating Orton. With this victory, Edge became the eighth man to win the Royal Rumble match twice, the third to win it from the number one position, and the first to win it after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge, with the help of Alexa Bliss, defeated Orton to end their feud.

At Elimination Chamber on February 21, Edge attacked WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns with the spear, making his decision to face him at WrestleMania 37. At Fastlane on March 21, Edge attacked Daniel Bryan, costing him the title and turning heel for the first time since 2010. On the March 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Daniel Bryan was added to the match, making it a triple threat match. On the second night of WrestleMania 37 on April 11, Edge ultimately lost the match to Reigns following the assistance from Jey Uso, thus becoming the first person to win the Royal Rumble twice and lose both championship matches at WrestleMania. After a two-month hiatus, Edge made his return on the June 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, attacking both Reigns and Jimmy Uso, turning face again. The following day on &quot;Talking Smack&quot;, it was announced that Edge would face Reigns for the Universal Championship at Money in the Bank. At Money in the Bank on July 18, Edge was unsuccessful in capturing the title due to interference from Seth Rollins.

Over the following weeks, Edge and Rollins kept confronting and attacking each other until the August 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, where Edge challenged Rollins to a match at SummerSlam, which Rollins accepted, starting the feud. At SummerSlam on August 21, Edge defeated Rollins by submission. Edge would then face Rollins on the September 10 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; where Rollins would win and attack Edge post-match in order to hospitalize him. As part of the 2021 Draft, Edge was drafted to the Raw brand. On the October 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge challenged Rollins to a Hell in a Cell match at Crown Jewel after Rollins broke into his house the previous week. At Crown Jewel on October 21, Edge subsequently defeated Rollins to end their feud. Edge returned on the November 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he was confronted by The Miz. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, after another heated verbal exchange between the two during a Miz TV segment, Miz challenged Edge to a match at Day 1, with Edge accepting. At Day 1 on January 1, 2022, Edge defeated Miz with help from his wife, Beth Phoenix. At Royal Rumble on January 29, Edge and his wife Beth Phoenix defeated The Miz and Maryse in a mixed tag team match.

==== The Judgment Day, final feuds and departure (2022–2023)====

On the February 21 show of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge reflected on all the WrestleMania moments in his career &amp; then he issued an open challenge for WrestleMania 38. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, his challenge was accepted by AJ Styles, but Edge viciously attacked him, turning heel. In the buildup to WrestleMania, Edge debuted a new gimmick and a new entrance theme, &quot;The Other Side&quot; by Alter Bridge. On the second night of WrestleMania 38 on April 3, Edge defeated Styles following a distraction by Damian Priest. Edge formed a faction with Priest named The Judgment Day. At WrestleMania Backlash on May 8, Edge defeated Styles with the help of Rhea Ripley, who became the newest member of The Judgment Day. At Hell in a Cell on June 5, The Judgment Day defeated Styles, Finn Bálor and Liv Morgan in a six-person mixed tag team match. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge introduced Bálor as the newest member of The Judgment Day. Almost immediately, Bálor, Priest &amp; Ripley suddenly turned on their leader, attacking Edge with his own signature con-chair-to move and kicking him out of the group.
At SummerSlam on July 30, Edge returned as a face to help The Mysterios (Rey and Dominik) win their No Disqualification match vs. The Judgment Day. He also returned with his previous theme song Metalingus by Alter Bridge on the next show of &quot;Raw&quot;. At Clash at the Castle on September 3, Edge teamed up with Rey Mysterio to defeat The Judgment Day. After the match however, Dominik attacked Edge with a low blow and clotheslined his father Rey. At Extreme Rules on October 8, Edge was defeated by Bálor in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match after interference from Dominik, Priest and Ripley. After he said &quot;I Quit&quot;, Ripley attacked his wife, Beth Phoenix (who also interfered during the match on his behalf), with a violent con-chair-to, causing her an injury (kayfabe). After a 3-month hiatus, Edge returned at the Royal Rumble on January 28, 2023, at #24 eliminating Bálor and Priest before being eliminated by them after interference from Dominik. At Elimination Chamber on February 18, Edge and Phoenix defeated Bálor and Ripley in a mixed tag team match despite interference from Dominik. In a press conference after the event, Edge answered Austin Theory&#x27;s open challenge for the United States Championship. On the next &quot;Raw&quot; show, Edge failed to win the title after an interference from Finn Bálor. On Night two of WrestleMania 39, Edge defeated Bálor in a Hell in a Cell match, finishing his rivalry with The Judgment Day.

In the 2023 WWE Draft, Edge was drafted to the SmackDown brand. Following being drafted to SmackDown, Edge would enter the tournament to crown the inaugural World Heavyweight Champion. On the May 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge would face AJ Styles and Rey Mysterio in the first round of the tournament, but would lose after being pinned by Styles. On the 7 July episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge was interviewed by Grayson Waller on &quot;The Grayson Waller Effect&quot;, where Edge would shoot down rumors of his retirement. Later that night, Edge would defeat Waller and praised him, following the match. On the August 18 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, which celebrated his 25 years with WWE, Edge defeated Sheamus in his hometown of Toronto in what would be his last appearance and match for WWE. Edge&#x27;s contract with WWE would expire on September 30.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2023–present) ===

==== TNT Champion (2023–2024) ====
On October 1, 2023, Copeland debuted in All Elite Wrestling (AEW) at the end of AEW&#x27;s WrestleDream PPV event under his real name and the &quot;Rated R Superstar&quot; monicker, saving Sting and Darby Allin from an attack by Christian Cage, Luchasaurus, and Nick Wayne. During the post-event media scrum, it was revealed that Copeland signed a full-time multi-year contract with AEW. Copeland began a feud with Cage, facing him and his stable, The Patriarchy, teaming with Allin &amp; Sting to defeat them in a six-man tag team match at Full Gear on November 18. Copeland would go onto defeat Cage for the TNT Championship at Worlds End, but lost it back to Cage when Cage invoked the title shot earned by his Patriarchy member Killswitch (formerly Luchasaurus) earlier that night to get an immediate rematch, ending Copeland&#x27;s reign in approximately three minutes. Copeland would regain the title in an &quot;I quit&quot; match on March 20, 2024, which started as the main event of &quot;Dynamite&quot; and concluded on a special live &quot;Rampage&quot;, both airing back-to-back ending their six-month feud. Copeland defended the TNT Championship on &quot;Dynamite&quot; and &quot;Collision&quot; in a series of open challenges, he dubbed &quot;The Cope Open&quot;, successfully defending the title against the likes of Matt Cardona, Penta El Zero Miedo, Buddy Matthews, Brody King &amp; Kyle O&#x27;Reilly. In March, Copeland would begin a feud with the House of Black (Malakai Black, Brody King &amp; Buddy Matthews). At the Dynasty event on April 21, Copeland teamed with Mark Briscoe &amp; Eddie Kingston to face the House of Black in a six-man tag team match, but lost. On May 26 at Double or Nothing, Copeland successfully defended the TNT Championship vs. Malakai Black in a barbed wire steel cage match. However, during the match, Copeland suffered a legitimate fractured tibia after leaping from the top of the cage, and was stripped of the title in kayfabe by AEW executive vice presidents The Young Bucks (Matthew Jackson and Nicholas Jackson) on the May 29 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, ending his second reign at 70 days.

==== World championship pursuits (2024–present) ====
On December 28 at Worlds End, Copeland returned after a 7-month hiatus after the main event and confronted AEW World Champion Jon Moxley. Copeland also formed alliance with FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood) and the trio went by the name &quot;Rated FTR&quot;. Rated FTR then began a feud with the Death Riders (Jon Moxley, Claudio Castagnoli, Marina Shafir, Pac, and Wheeler Yuta). On January 1, 2025 at Fight for the Fallen, Copeland adopted the ring name &quot;Cope&quot; (an abbreviation of his surname), but was still called by his real name on occasion by commentators and other wrestlers. During his feud with the Death Riders, Cope also formed an alliance with Jay White.

==Professional wrestling style and persona==

Edge utilizes the spear as his finisher. WWE announcer Michael Cole praised the psychology Edge included in the move, since &quot;he knew that the longer he made the audience wait, the better it was going to be&quot;. He has also performed other finishers including a lifting DDT called the &quot;Edgecution&quot; in WWE or the &quot;Impaler&quot; in AEW, and an inverted sharpshooter submission hold called the &quot;Edgecator&quot;.

Weeks before his WWE debut in 1998, vignettes were aired depicting Edge as a loner, mysteriously roaming across New York City in various locations such as on rooftops and the subway. The vignettes also depicted him, as Jim Ross described it on his debut, as &quot;some sort of a tortured soul&quot; by showing an excessive amount of rage and beating up on innocent pedestrians. A female voice is also heard describing who Edge&#x27;s persona is and his characteristics, the same voice that would be used to say, &quot;You think you know me?&quot; in the opening of Edge&#x27;s entrance themes throughout his career in WWE. Upon his debut, Edge would enter the arena through the crowd for his matches and would continue to do so until becoming a tag team with Christian. In a 2019 interview, Copeland described how &quot;as much as it didn&#x27;t make sense, I still knew that they [WWE] were trying to set me up as much as they could.&quot;

Upon teaming with Christian and Gangrel, the group&#x27;s gimmick was that of a clan of vampires, although they were often merely described by announcers as living a &quot;gothic lifestyle&quot;. The trio would often make a dramatic entrance into arenas by emerging through a ring of fire onto the elevated stage floor, with Gangrel holding a chalice of &quot;blood&quot;. Gangrel would typically take a sip from the chalice and sometimes share it with Edge or Christian before spitting it towards the crowd. One of their signature moves was giving their opponents a &quot;blood bath&quot; either before or after a match, where the lights would go out, followed by Gangrel&#x27;s red flashing entrance lights, and then the arena lights coming back on to reveal their target covered in &quot;blood&quot;. All three members of the group had long blond hair, with Gangrel and Christian wearing white shirts and dark pants, while Edge stuck to his long leather coat from his previous persona before joining The Brood. Copeland has mentioned feeling insecure about his previous loner character and welcomed the opportunity to join The Brood, feeling it gave him the confidence he needed at the time.

Following their victory at WrestleMania 2000, Edge &amp; Christian began redefining themselves as a villainous duo of comedic, arrogant, surfer-styled teen idols. The two wrestlers no longer entered the arena through the crowd, instead engaging in various antics such as mocking their opponents and the city they were in. They used unique phrases like &quot;reek of awesomeness&quot; and wore outrageous costumes. One of their trademark moves was the &quot;five-second pose&quot; where they would strike odd poses in the ring for fans to take photos, often ridiculing their opponents or aspects of the local pride to rile up the crowd. This included mocking Elvis Presley in Memphis or imitating Bill Buckner&#x27;s 1986 World Series error at the King of the Ring event in Boston.

Upon being drafted to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in 2002, Edge evolved as a determined singles competitor who claimed that the &quot;future is now.&quot; During this period, Edge would have seen significant popularity and stronger rivalries. Once Edge returned and turned heel in 2004, he would become cocky and brash, while also becoming more vicious and destructive than ever before in his pursuit for the World Heavyweight Championship.

After his affair with Lita was brought to television as an on-screen relationship in 2005, Edge began to adopt the persona of a villain who reveled in controversy, nicknamed &quot;The Rated-R Superstar.&quot; This moniker was solidified when Edge and Lita performed a &quot;live sex celebration&quot; segment after he won his first WWE Championship in early 2006. He is also nicknamed &quot;The Master Manipulator&quot; and &quot;The Ultimate Opportunist&quot; due to how he used the Money in the Bank briefcase along with other underhanded opportunities to win numerous World Titles. When asked about the persona, Copleand stated that the &quot;Rated-R Superstar&quot; persona of Edge was similar to that of a , &quot;kind of like an &#x27;Appetite for Destruction&#x27; era Guns N&#x27; Roses, or &#x27;Too Fast for Love&#x27; era Mötley Crüe; like this sleazy, slimy, pretty horrible person that you could picture crawling under the gutter to try and steal your girlfriend. He was that guy, and that, I always said, when I walked through the curtain, that’s when I became &#x27;Edge&#x27;. And as soon as I walked back through that curtain, I&#x27;m going to grab a coffee and I&#x27;m right back to being Adam.&quot;

In 2012, WWE voted him as both the third-best World Heavyweight Champion and 20th-best wrestling villain in WWE history. His entrance theme, &quot;Metalingus&quot; by Alter Bridge, was selected as the greatest in WWE history by the company in a 2013 list.

== Acting career ==
In 2000, Copeland had a cameo appearance as a road bandit in the fantasy movie &quot;&quot;. In March 2002, he appeared with other wrestlers on the quiz show &quot;Weakest Link&quot;. He was voted out in the first round, and the eventual winner was Kane. On the August 6, 2006 episode of &quot;Mind of Mencia&quot;, he appeared as Edge as a commentator for &quot;The Royal Religious Rumble&quot;. He punched out an actor playing L. Ron Hubbard to stop Scientology from ruling the world and then speared another actor playing Tom Cruise. In March 2007, Copeland appeared alongside Randy Orton, John Cena, and Bobby Lashley on &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. Weeks later, he appeared on the sketch comedy show &quot;MADtv&quot;. He appeared in a Slim Jim commercial, in which his &quot;spicy side&quot; caused chaos in a DMV, a restaurant, and a hotel. &quot;Edge: a Decade of Decadence&quot;, a DVD documentary of Copeland&#x27;s life, was released in December 2008. The DVD illustrates his wrestling career dating from when he entered the WWF to 2008.

In June 2011, Copeland appeared as Thelo, an Abnormal, in the &quot;Sanctuary&quot; episode &quot;Into the Black&quot;. In September 2011, he held an &quot;Edgucational&quot; Essay Scholarship Contest, as an echo back to how he himself got a start in the wrestling business. The scholarship went to one of the students at Squared Circle Wrestling in Toronto, Alysha Verhoven, who has since gone on to work as Leah von Dutch. Copeland appeared regularly in the Syfy series &quot;Haven&quot;, which started in July 2011, as Dwight Hendrickson, a troubled man whose affliction is revealed to be attracting bullets and who works as a cleaner, cleaning up after the troubles. He is later appointed the Chief of Police. He was part of the cast until the show&#x27;s series finale in December 2015. WWE Studios released &quot;Bending the Rules&quot;, in which Copeland starred, in 2012. WWE released the official trailer of the film on the February 28, 2012 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. The 2012 documentary, &quot;You Think You Know Me The Story of Edge&quot;, includes a look at Copeland&#x27;s life and career in pro wrestling.

On September 4, 2013, Copeland hosted a special episode of the Syfy series &quot;Ghost Mine&quot;. In December 2014, Copeland made a cameo appearance in the music video for the In-Flight Safety song &quot;Destroy&quot; as his Dwight Hendrickson character. In July 2015, Copeland was nominated for a Golden Maple Award for Best Actor in a TV series which was broadcast in the U.S. for his role in Haven as Dwight Hendrickson. On July 16, 2015, it was announced that Copeland would be set to portray Atom-Smasher in the second season of &quot;The Flash&quot;. On February 21, 2016, Copeland and Christian began starring on &quot;The Edge and Christian Show That Totally Reeks of Awesomeness&quot;, a series on the WWE Network. On July 14, 2016, Copeland starred in the Canadian television series &quot;Private Eyes&quot; where he played Ben Fisk. On July 26, 2016, it was announced that Copeland would play Kjetill Flatnose on Season 5 and 6 of the &quot;Vikings&quot; in a recurring role. The series ended December 30, 2020.

On October 13, 2022, it was announced that Copeland would play Ares in the &quot;Percy Jackson and the Olympians&quot; TV series adaptation of the original book series, streaming on Disney+.

== Other media ==
His autobiography, &quot;Adam Copeland on Edge&quot;, was released on November 2, 2004. Unlike most wrestlers who used &quot;ghostwriters&quot; to write their biographies, Copeland wrote the entire book himself, in longhand. Mick Foley, who also wrote his wrestling autobiography himself in longhand, wrote the foreword to his book.

In March 2016, Copeland appeared on CBC&#x27;s &quot;Canada Reads&quot; competition where he championed the book &quot;Minister Without Portfolio&quot; by the English-born Canadian writer and author Michael Winter.

From March 2017 to September 2019, Copeland co-hosted the &quot;E&amp;C&#x27;s Pod of Awesomeness&quot; podcast with Christian. He has since left the podcast.

On August 21, 2022, Edge was the subject of an episode of the documentary series &quot;&quot;.

== Video games ==
== Personal life ==
Copeland lives in Asheville, North Carolina. He began a relationship with Alannah Morley, the sister of wrestler Val Venis, in 1998; they married on November 8, 2001, and divorced on March 10, 2004. He married Lisa Ortiz on October 21, 2004. Soon after marrying her, he began an affair with wrestler Lita, who was dating his friend Matt Hardy. The affair became public knowledge in February 2005, resulting in Copeland and Ortiz divorcing on November 17, 2005. Copeland and Elizabeth Kociański, who wrestles as Beth Phoenix in WWE, began a relationship together in 2011. They had a daughter in 2013 and a second daughter in 2016. They were married on October 30, 2016 (his 43rd birthday).

Copeland is a lifelong close friend of wrestler Christian Cage. He is a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs and New Jersey Devils ice hockey teams, and used to play ice hockey with retired NHL player Aaron Downey. He has said that he smoked one cigarette when he was 16, hated it, and has not smoked since. He has several tattoos including a red and black sun on his left upper biceps which covers a former tattoo of a muscular shark, a star on his right upper biceps with several smaller stars and two skulls wearing bandanas adorned with flowers and hearts, a cross on his left forearm, and a scroll adorned with the words &quot;Rise Above&quot;. All of his tattoos represent a stage in his career.

In March 2007, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; investigated a steroid and human growth hormone (hGH) ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. An article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Copeland, who was alleged to have obtained hGH. Copeland previously admitted to using steroids in April 2004 as an experiment after neck surgery, but said he felt like they slowed him down so he quickly stopped using them. According to Copeland, he took hGH after returning from a spinal fusion neck surgery because doctors told him that it would help the bones grow back around the screws and plate that were inserted into his neck. A &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article in August 2007 named Copeland as one of 10 wrestlers who were found to have purchased steroids and other drugs from an online pharmacy in violation of WWE&#x27;s Talent Wellness program. He was said to have received the growth hormones somatropin and genotropin, as well as the steroid stanozolol, between September 2004 and February 2007.

<text>Eduardo Gory Guerrero Llanes (October 9, 1967 – November 13, 2005) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his tenures in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). A prominent member of the Guerrero wrestling family, being the son of first-generation wrestler Gory Guerrero, he is widely considered to be one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. 

Guerrero performed in Mexico and Japan for several major professional wrestling promotions, and in the United States he performed for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and most notably World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/WWE). Guerrero&#x27;s gimmick was that of &quot;Latino Heat&quot;, a crafty, resourceful wrestler who would do anything to win a match. His catchphrase became &quot;I Lie! I Cheat! I Steal!&quot; and was used in one of his entrance themes; he partly used this phrase in the title of his 2005 autobiography, &quot;Cheating Death, Stealing Life&quot;. Despite being a heel for most of his career, he was popular in and out of the ring and was at the peak of his career as a face during 2003–2005, becoming the top wrestler on the SmackDown brand in 2004. He experienced various substance abuse problems, including alcoholism and an addiction to painkillers; these real-life issues were sometimes incorporated into his storylines.

Guerrero spent much of his early career wrestling in Mexican promotions and forming a popular tag team with Art Barr. After the death of Barr, Guerrero received his first mainstream exposure in the United States in 1995 by joining ECW and winning the ECW World Television Championship two times. Later that year, Guerrero moved to WCW, where he became WCW United States Champion and WCW Cruiserweight Champion and also led the Latino World Order. He left WCW in 2000 after the company failed to elevate him to a main event spot.

He moved to WWF during the Attitude Era with his WCW colleagues Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn, who formed a group called The Radicalz. Guerrero went on to win the WWF European Championship and WWF Intercontinental Championship before he was released in 2001 due to addiction issues. After being rehired in 2002, he formed Los Guerreros with his nephew Chavo, winning the WWE Tag Team Championship, and established himself on the SmackDown brand. He climbed to main event status and won the WWE Championship, his sole world championship at No Way Out 2004. He lost the title later that year but remained a popular main eventer until his sudden death on November 13, 2005.

He was posthumously inducted into the WWE, AAA, &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; and Hardcore halls of fame.

== Early life ==
Guerrero was born and raised in El Paso, Texas, where he graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School (La Jeff) in 1985. He attended the University of New Mexico, and then New Mexico Highlands University on an athletic scholarship. It was there that Guerrero entered collegiate wrestling before moving to Mexico to train as a professional wrestler. He followed in the footsteps of his brothers and father, who had also wrestled in Mexico. As a boy, he would attend the wrestling promotions held by his father Gory Guerrero at the El Paso County Coliseum. Guerrero&#x27;s father allowed him and his nephew Chavo to wrestle each other during intermissions.

== Professional wrestling career ==
===Early career (1986–1992)===
Guerrero debuted in 1986. In 1989, he appeared with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as a jobber, most notably wrestling Terry Funk. In 1991, he would return for WrestleWar &#x27;91, wrestling a dark match, teaming with Ultraman to defeat Huichol and Rudy Boy Gonzalez. Guerrero wrestled as the original &quot;Máscara Mágica&quot; in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) until his departure in 1992. He then left the company to pursue a career with Asistencia Asesoría y Administración. Although the Máscara Mágica gimmick was popular, CMLL owned the rights to the character. Guerrero then appeared on a televised AAA show as Máscara Mágica, only to then unmask himself along with the aid of his tag team partner that night, Octagón.

=== Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (1992–1995) ===

In Mexico, Guerrero wrestled mainly for Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA), teaming with El Hijo del Santo as the new version of La Pareja Atómica (The Atomic Pair), the tag team of Gory Guerrero and El Santo.

After Guerrero turned on Santo and allied with Art Barr as &quot;la Pareja del Terror&quot; (&quot;the Pair of Terror&quot;), the duo became arguably the most hated tag team in lucha libre history. Along with Barr, Konnan, Chicano Power, and Madonna&#x27;s Boyfriend, Guerrero formed los Gringos Locos (&quot;the Crazy Americans&quot;), a villainous stable. Guerrero later said that no matter how many people joined los Gringos Locos, the stable was all about Barr. Locos feuded mostly with El Hijo del Santo and his partner Octagón, eventually ending in a Hair vs. Mask match at the first Lucha pay-per-view in America, &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;, which they lost.

Guerrero and Barr&#x27;s first break would come when they were noticed in late-1994 by the owner of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), Paul Heyman, and were approached about wrestling for him in 1995. Barr, however, died before he could join ECW with Guerrero.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1992–1996) ===
In 1992, Guerrero began wrestling in Japan for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he was known as the second incarnation of Black Tiger. He became more successful upon his return when he won the 1996 Best of the Super Juniors tournament of junior heavyweights. He received a shot at the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion The Great Sasuke at Skydiving J, but lost the match.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995) ===
Guerrero won the ECW World Television Championship from 2 Cold Scorpio in his debut match for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) on April 8, 1995, at Three Way Dance. He went on to have a series of acclaimed matches with Dean Malenko before they both signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) later that year. Guerrero lost the ECW Television Championship to Malenko on July 21 of that year, but Guerrero regained the title on July 28. Guerrero lost the ECW Television Championship back to 2 Cold Scorpio on August 25. The next day, they had their last match which ended in a draw in a two out of three falls match at the ECW Arena. After the match, the locker room emptied and the two were carried around the ring by their fellow wrestlers while the crowd chanted &quot;please don&#x27;t go&quot;.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1995–2000)===
==== Debut; championship reigns (1995–1997) ====
Guerrero returned to WCW in late 1995 along with Dean Malenko and Chris Benoit with whom he had worked with in NJPW and ECW. Guerrero competed in his first match on August 30, losing to Malenko, which aired on the October 7 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Guerrero made his televised debut in WCW on the September 17 episode of &quot;Main Event&quot; against Alex Wright in a match which ended in a no contest after Guerrero injured his knee. Guerrero won a rematch against Wright on the October 21 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. His first televised pay-per-view appearance was at World War 3 where he competed in the 3-ring, 60-man World War 3 battle royal for the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Guerrero was one of the final nine men in the battle royal (notably being one of only two men in the group to be under the age of 35, the other being The Giant) until he was tossed out of the ring by Four Horsemen members. At Starrcade: World Cup of Wrestling in December 1995, Guerrero represented WCW in a WCW vs. NJPW World Cup tournament, which saw him losing to Shinjiro Otani in the match, but WCW would go on to win the series at 4–3.

In 1996, Guerrero received several shots at the United States Heavyweight Championship against Konnan at Uncensored and Ric Flair at Hog Wild. He feuded with Ric Flair and the Four Horsemen during 1996 after Guerrero&#x27;s partner Arn Anderson turned on him during a tag team match against Ric Flair and Randy Savage. In late 1996, he feuded with Diamond Dallas Page after defeating him in a match at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXIII&quot;. He started feuding with DDP to steal his nickname of &quot;Lord of the Ring&quot;, but lost. Guerrero participated in a tournament for the vacant WCW United States Heavyweight Championship and defeated DDP in the final round at Starrcade to win the United States title in December 1996.

In 1997, Guerrero defended the United States Heavyweight Championship against Scott Norton at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXIV&quot;, Syxx in a ladder match at Souled Out, and Chris Jericho at SuperBrawl VII. His reign came to an end at Uncensored when Dean Malenko defeated him for the title. Following the title loss, Guerrero defeated Malenko in a non-title rematch on the next night&#x27;s &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; before taking time off. He returned to WCW after a two-month hiatus on the June 9 episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; and avenged the title loss by interfering in Malenko&#x27;s title defense against Jeff Jarrett and attacking Malenko, costing him the title and turning heel in the process.

Shortly after his return, Guerrero feuded with Jericho focusing on Jericho&#x27;s Cruiserweight Championship. He challenged Jericho for the title at &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXV&quot; but lost. Guerrero demanded a rematch for the title. In the opening match of Fall Brawl, Guerrero defeated Jericho to win the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship. He dropped the title to Rey Mysterio Jr. at Halloween Havoc in a title vs. mask match where Mysterio&#x27;s mask was also on the line. On the November 10 episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, he regained the Cruiserweight Championship from Mysterio, and made a successful title defense against Mysterio at World War 3. After retaining the title against Dean Malenko in the opening bout of Starrcade in December 1997, Guerrero dropped the title to Último Dragón the following day on the December 29 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;.

==== Latino World Order; Filthy Animals (1998–2000) ====

On the March 9, 1998 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Guerrero&#x27;s nephew Chavo Guerrero lost to Booker T in a match. After the match, Guerrero delivered a suplex to Chavo for the main purpose of teaching him a lesson. On the March 12 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, he defeated his nephew Chavo in a match and forced him to become his &quot;slave&quot;. At Uncensored, Chavo was forced to support Guerrero when he faced Booker T for Booker&#x27;s WCW World Television Championship. Guerrero lost the match after receiving a missile dropkick. Guerrero and Chavo feuded with Último Dragón. Chavo lost to Dragón at Spring Stampede. At Slamboree, Guerrero defeated Dragón despite interference from Chavo. After the match, Chavo kissed Eddie and began to display insane behavior. At The Great American Bash, Chavo got an upset victory over Guerrero. They faced each other in a hair vs. hair match at Bash at the Beach which Guerrero won. Continuing to show his crazy behavior Chavo would shave his own head while Guerrero looked on in disbelief. Guerrero saved Chavo from beatings by Stevie Ray, seeming that he would align with Chavo but he wanted his release.

Despite his success and popularity, Guerrero had been one of many wrestlers who were frustrated at never being given a chance to be main event stars in WCW. These frustrations came to a head when Guerrero requested that WCW President Eric Bischoff either push his character or give him a raise for family reasons. Bischoff responded by allegedly throwing coffee at Guerrero (however, in his autobiography, Guerrero states that Bischoff accidentally knocked his coffee off the table and that it was a complete accident that he was hit). Furious, Guerrero demanded Bischoff release him from his contract on a live episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. Guerrero then left the company for months, angry at Bischoff for what he had done. Guerrero later returned to WCW, leading to the belief that maybe Guerrero&#x27;s angry speeches against Bischoff were a work (Guerrero later confirmed it to be a worked shoot). Guerrero would later contradict himself on WWE&#x27;s DVD &quot;Monday Night War&quot; claiming that he tried to put personal differences aside for the good of the company, yet found himself angry and outraged once more because of Bischoff&#x27;s supposed continued refusal to elevate Guerrero and other similar wrestlers. He let Brian Adams pin him and get an upset victory in a match.

On-screen, Guerrero responded to Bischoff&#x27;s actions by forming the Latino World Order (LWO), which was a take-off of Bischoff&#x27;s New World Order. The group was an answer to Bischoff&#x27;s &quot;refusal&quot; to push Latino wrestlers in ways they felt they deserved. The LWO was formed in October when Guerrero returned to WCW, with Héctor Garza and Damien. The group eventually grew to encompass almost all the Mexican wrestlers working for WCW at the time. They mainly feuded with Rey Mysterio Jr. and Billy Kidman because they wanted Mysterio to join the group. He faced Kidman in a match for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, but Mysterio interfered and helped Kidman win the match and keep the title. However, Guerrero was involved in a car accident on New Year&#x27;s Day 1999 that cut short the LWO storyline.

After his return on the May 31, 1999 episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, Guerrero became a founding member of the Filthy Animals alongside Rey Mysterio Jr. and Konnan. They feuded with the Dead Pool (Insane Clown Posse and Vampiro). They received two straight victories over the Dead Pool at Road Wild and Fall Brawl. They next feuded with Revolution (Shane Douglas, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, and Perry Saturn). Guerrero was victorious over Saturn by disqualification in a singles match at Halloween Havoc. At Mayhem, the Animals lost to Revolution in a mixed tag team elimination match. When Vince Russo was fired as WCW booker and replaced by Kevin Sullivan, Guerrero asked for and received a release from his contract on January 19, 2000. He signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2000 along with fellow WCW stars Benoit, Malenko, and Saturn.

=== World Wrestling Federation (2000–2001) ===
Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn debuted in the WWF on the January 31, 2000 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot; as The Radicalz, interfering in a match involving The New Age Outlaws, establishing themselves as faces. During his first match with the WWF, a tag team match with Perry Saturn against The New Age Outlaws, Guerrero performed a frog splash off the top rope and dislocated his elbow when he landed the move; as a result, he was sidelined for several weeks. Guerrero and Saturn had originally been booked to defeat The New Age Outlaws, but due to his injury, Guerrero panicked and told Road Dogg, who was in the tag team match with Billy Gunn against Guerrero and Saturn, to immediately pin him.
After losing their &quot;tryout matches&quot; upon entry, The Radicalz aligned themselves with WWF Champion Triple H and became a heel faction.

In March, Guerrero, who was wrestling as a heel, began pursuing the affections of Chyna, who he referred to as his &quot;Mamacita&quot;. At the time, Chyna was allies with Chris Jericho and initially rejected his advances. On the April 3 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Guerrero faced off against Jericho for the WWF European Championship. During the match, Chyna turned on Jericho and helped Guerrero win, and later explained her actions by declaring that she could not resist his &quot;Latino Heat&quot;. After Guerrero abandoned Lita to be attacked by The Dudley Boyz, he and Chyna began a feud with Essa Rios and Lita, ending in a European title defense at Backlash on April 30, which was also billed as the night of Guerrero&#x27;s prom (he was said to have just earned a GED). Guerrero defeated Rios after arriving at ringside in a 1957 Chevrolet, even wrestling in his tuxedo pants and a bow tie. Guerrero turned face and successfully retained the title against former Radicalz friends Saturn and Malenko in a triple threat match at Judgment Day on May 21, before losing the title to Saturn at Fully Loaded on July 23. The two slowly began to become popular with the fans, but over the next few months friction began to build between Guerrero and Chyna.

Chyna was upset when Guerrero pinned her to advance in the King of the Ring tournament. Then at SummerSlam on August 27, Guerrero and Chyna wrestled an Intergender tag team match against Trish Stratus and Val Venis, who at the time was the reigning WWF Intercontinental Champion. The Intercontinental Championship was on the line in the match, and whoever scored the pin would win the title. Guerrero&#x27;s team won the match, but Chyna scored the pin on Trish and became a two-time Intercontinental Champion. Although Guerrero said he did not mind that Chyna was the champion, on the September 4 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot; he went to WWF Commissioner Mick Foley and asked to be inserted into Chyna&#x27;s title defense against Kurt Angle claiming that he did not want Angle to hurt his &quot;mamacita&quot;. During the course of the match, Angle knocked down Chyna with the title belt and Guerrero laid on top of her to try to revive her. However, this resulted in Guerrero &quot;accidentally&quot; pinning Chyna as her shoulders were still on the mat, and thus Guerrero won the match and his first Intercontinental Championship. Chyna became visibly uncomfortable as Guerrero began to cheat in order to retain his title, while Guerrero was upset that Chyna was posing for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, even trying to invade the Playboy Mansion to stop the photo shoot. Just when it appeared that Chyna would leave Guerrero, he proposed to her and she accepted. At Unforgiven on September 24, Chyna helped Guerrero in retaining his title against Rikishi. The engagement was called off when Guerrero was caught showering with two of The Godfather&#x27;s hos (one of whom would later wrestle as Victoria) claiming that &quot;two Mamacitas are better than one&quot;.

Guerrero turned heel again as a result of the incident. Then, The Radicalz reunited and feuded with the reformed D-Generation X (Chyna, Billy Gunn, Road Dogg, and K-Kwik) (DX). They defeated DX at Survivor Series on November 19 in an elimination tag team match and assisted Triple H in his match with Stone Cold Steve Austin. Guerrero was later defeated by Gunn for the Intercontinental Championship on the November 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. At Rebellion on December 2, Guerrero and Malenko lost to Gunn and Chyna. Benoit left the group to focus on a singles career while the rest of The Radicalz feuded with Lita and The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff). At Armageddon on December 10, The Radicalz defeated The Hardy Boyz and Lita in an elimination tag team match.

In early 2001, Guerrero feuded with Chris Jericho, Benoit, and X-Pac over Jericho&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship. At No Way Out on February 25, the four men faced each other in a fatal four-way match, which Jericho won. Guerrero focused on the European Championship, feuding with the champion Test defeating him at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1 to win his second and final European Championship with help from Saturn and Malenko. On the April 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero would lose the title to Matt Hardy. At Backlash on April 29, Guerrero competed in a Triple threat match for the WWF European Championship but failed to win the title. In April, The Radicalz feuded with Test and his partners. Guerrero eventually left the Radicalz, siding with The Hardy Boyz and Lita. At Insurrextion on May 5, Guerrero defeated Grand Master Sexay. Around this point, Guerrero developed an addiction to pain medication stemming from his 1999 car accident and in May 2001 was sent to rehab, missing the entire Invasion storyline that featured his former fellow WCW (and later ECW) wrestlers. To explain his absence, a storyline was created where Guerrero was &quot;injured&quot; by Albert in a match. On November 9, 2001, he was arrested for drunk driving and was subsequently released by the WWF three days later.

=== Independent circuit; New Japan Pro Wrestling (2001–2002) ===
Guerrero started wrestling on the independent circuit after his release from the WWF. On February 23, 2002, he faced Super Crazy on the debut show of Ring of Honor known as &quot;The Era of Honor Begins&quot; to crown the first-ever IWA Intercontinental Champion. Guerrero lost the match. On February 24, he debuted in the Australian promotion World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) at The Revolution beating the champion Juventud Guerrera and Psicosis in a Triple Threat match for the WWA International Cruiserweight Championship. On March 1, he defeated the champion CM Punk and Rey Mysterio in a Triple Threat match for the IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship. He dropped the title back to Punk one day later on March 2. He vacated the WWA Cruiserweight title in April 2002 after returning to the WWF.

Guerrero also returned to New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) for a brief period in March 2002, this time unmasked. He aligned himself with the villainous Team 2000 stable, and primarily teamed with Black Tiger.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2005) ===

==== Teaming with Chris Benoit (2002) ====
Guerrero returned to the WWF on the April 1, 2002 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, attacking Rob Van Dam. He feuded with Van Dam, defeating him for his second Intercontinental Championship at Backlash on April 21. After retaining the title against Van Dam at Insurrextion on May 4 and Judgment Day on May 19, he finally lost the title to Van Dam on the May 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in a ladder match in which a fan in an Edmonton Oilers jersey pushed him off a ladder. Guerrero then feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin, but Austin left the WWE before a match could take place. Chris Benoit returned to WWE the night Guerrero lost the title and reunited with him. Guerrero and Benoit feuded with Ric Flair for a while and Guerrero lost a match to Flair at King of the Ring on June 23.

On the August 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero and Benoit moved to WWE&#x27;s SmackDown! brand. Guerrero feuded with Edge, to whom he lost at SummerSlam on August 25. Guerrero continued his feud with Edge, whom he defeated at Unforgiven on September 22; they then had a no disqualification match on the September 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; which Edge won thus ending the rivalry.

==== Los Guerreros (2002–2004) ====

With Benoit focusing on Kurt Angle, Guerrero aligned himself with his nephew Chavo, forming the tag team Los Guerreros. In contrast to a previous WCW storyline with his nephew, Chavo fully agreed with his uncle as their slogan stated: &quot;We lie, we cheat, and we steal, but at least we&#x27;re honest about it&quot;. To push the new tag team, vignettes were produced, which included things such as the two finagling their way into a rich lady&#x27;s house and throwing a pool party. These segments marked the beginning of the rise of popularity for the team, especially Eddie, who continued to use the mannerisms.

The duo entered the eight-team tournament for the new WWE Tag Team Championship, sneaking past Rikishi and Mark Henry in the opening round, before starting a feud with the newly formed tag team of Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit. In one of the team&#x27;s definitive moments, Chavo told Benoit that his former friend Guerrero was assaulted by his tag team partner Angle. Benoit ran to make the save, only to have himself locked inside a room. Guerrero then appeared in the room and assaulted Benoit with a steel chair. Benoit and Angle managed to overcome their differences and eventually defeated Los Guerreros in the tournament semi-finals. Later on, Benoit and Angle won the title. Benoit and Angle then fought for a trophy for being the first WWE Tag Team Champions. Much to Benoit&#x27;s surprise, Los Guerreros helped him win the match.

At Survivor Series on November 17, Los Guerreros faced the new champions Edge and Rey Mysterio and the team of Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit for the titles. Guerrero made Mysterio submit to the &quot;Lasso from El Paso&quot; to win their first WWE Tag Team Championship. They turned face due to their popularity. They lost the titles to Team Angle (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) on the February 6, 2003 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Los Guerreros and Team Angle began feuding with each other. Los Guerreros participated at WrestleMania XIX on March 30 as contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship, along with the team of Chris Benoit and Rhyno. Both teams lost to Team Angle in a triple threat match. At Backlash on April 27, Los Guerreros lost to Team Angle in a rematch.

Chavo Guerrero legitimately tore his biceps, forcing Guerrero to look for another partner. He chose Tajiri, and they won the WWE Tag Team Championship, Guerrero&#x27;s second and Tajiri&#x27;s first at Judgment Day on May 18 by defeating Team Angle in a ladder match. The following week, Guerrero and Tajiri managed to retain their titles against Team Angle by cheating. They also defeated Roddy Piper and his protégé Sean O&#x27;Haire in Madison Square Garden on the June 26 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. After Guerrero and Tajiri lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team (previously Team Angle) on the July 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero turned on Tajiri, slamming his partner through the windshield of his low-rider truck, turning heel once again.
In July 2003, Guerrero competed in a tournament for the WWE United States Championship. He managed to advance to the final round, defeating Último Dragón and Billy Gunn in the process, where he would meet Chris Benoit. At Vengeance on July 27, Guerrero turned to his cheating tactics, hitting Benoit with the belt at one point in the match. Guerrero tried to get Benoit in trouble by placing the title belt on top of the unconscious Benoit. It did not work, however, since he knocked out the referee earlier with a championship belt shot to the kidneys. The match ended with interference and a &quot;Gore&quot; from Rhyno, Benoit&#x27;s partner, who was furious at the team&#x27;s failure. Guerrero pinned Benoit and won the United States Championship.

At SummerSlam on August 24, Guerrero retained his title by defeating Rhyno, Benoit, and Tajiri in a fatal four-way match. He later began a feud with John Cena, turning face once again. On the September 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero challenged Cena to a &quot;Latino Heat&quot; Parking Lot Brawl match for the United States Championship, which Guerrero won with help from his returning nephew, Chavo. The next week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Los Guerreros defeated The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team to win the WWE Tag Team Championship, making Guerrero a double champion (beginning Guerrero&#x27;s third tag title reign).

Guerrero engaged in a feud with Big Show, which involved Guerrero giving Big Show some laxative laced burritos and then later spraying Big Show from a sewage truck. The feud ended when Guerrero lost the United States Championship to Big Show at No Mercy on October 19. Four days later, Los Guerreros lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to the Basham Brothers (Danny and Doug). They began feuding with the Basham Brothers, but failed to regain the championship at Survivor Series on November 16. As Los Guerreros attempted to regain the tag team titles, things began to go downhill between Chavo and Eddie, as animosity began to build. Chavo then attacked and turned on Guerrero after he suffered a beating from the Basham Brothers on the January 8, 2004 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Guerrero feuded with Chavo and defeated him at the Royal Rumble on January 25 to settle their feud. After the match Eddie attacked Chavo causing him to bleed.

==== WWE Champion (2004) ====

When Chris Benoit jumped to the Raw brand after winning the Royal Rumble match, using his title shot to go for Triple H&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship, Guerrero won a 15-man Royal Rumble match on the January 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to earn a shot at the WWE Championship. After becoming the number one contender, Guerrero elevated himself to main event status and began feuding with the champion Brock Lesnar, whom he defeated to win the WWE Championship in the main event of No Way Out on February 15, his first world championship win in WWE. The victory made him a Triple Crown and Grand Slam Champion in the process. His next feud was with Kurt Angle, whom he defeated at WrestleMania XX on March 14 to retain his title in his first big defense. At the end of WrestleMania, Guerrero celebrated in the ring with longtime friend Chris Benoit, who had just won the World Heavyweight Championship.

On the March 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he started a feud with fellow Texan John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) after JBL interrupted Guerrero&#x27;s title match with Booker T. The rivalry would soon turn personal when at a non-televised live event, JBL caused Guerrero&#x27;s mother to suffer a (kayfabe) heart attack while in attendance at ringside. At Judgment Day on May 16, Guerrero defended his WWE title against JBL, retaining the title after getting himself disqualified, hitting JBL with the championship title. The match witnessed Guerrero bleed heavily mid-way in the match as a result of Guerrero performing a bladejob after a stiff headshot ringside with a chair from JBL. It was later explained that he cut too deep, thus hitting an artery. After the match concluded, Guerrero was persuaded to go to hospital by WWE producer Bruce Prichard where his wound was stitched up and he received IV fluids.

At The Great American Bash on June 27, Guerrero defended the title against JBL in a Texas bullrope match. JBL won after Kurt Angle (who was General Manager of SmackDown! at the time) reversed the decision after Guerrero appeared to have retained the title. On the July 8 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero pulled a switcharoo with Shannon Moore, who was wrestling as &quot;El Gran Luchadore&quot; and wore the costume. On the July 15 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero faced JBL in a steel cage match for the WWE title where El Gran Luchadore appeared again and cost Guerrero the match; he later revealed himself as Kurt Angle. Guerrero continued his feud with Angle.

At SummerSlam on August 15, Guerrero lost to Angle after submitting to his ankle lock. Guerrero then allied himself with Big Show. Each week Angle and his new allies Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak began targeting Guerrero and Big Show. Guerrero defeated Reigns in a singles match at No Mercy on October 3. General Manager Theodore Long booked a Survivor Series Elimination match between a team led by Guerrero and a team led by Angle. Guerrero&#x27;s team consisted of himself, Big Show, John Cena (replacing the originally chosen Rey Mysterio), and Rob Van Dam. At Survivor Series on November 14, Guerrero&#x27;s team defeated Angle&#x27;s team.

==== Final storylines (2004–2005) ====
Guerrero, along with Booker T and The Undertaker, then challenged JBL for a WWE Championship rematch. Along the way, Guerrero found a partner in Booker T. At Armageddon on December 12, Guerrero and Booker T&#x27;s initial teamwork broke away, and the match ended with JBL pinning Booker T following the &quot;Clothesline From Hell&quot;. Afterwards, Guerrero and Booker T briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. At the Royal Rumble on January 30, 2005, Guerrero entered the namesake match at #1 and lasted 28:11 before being eliminated by Edge. In a skit before the Royal Rumble match, he drew his number the same time Ric Flair drew his. In an attempt to get a better draw, Guerrero switched his number with Flair&#x27;s (and stole Flair&#x27;s wallet in the process). Theodore Long made him return both items before the match. Flair would enter at #30. 

At No Way Out on February 20, Guerrero teamed up with longtime friend and sometimes rival, Rey Mysterio and defeated the Basham Brothers to win his final title, the WWE Tag Team Championship for a fourth time, with it being Mysterio&#x27;s third reign. Many expected the new champions to defend their title at WrestleMania 21 on April 3, but after encouragement from Chavo, Guerrero challenged Mysterio to a one-on-one match instead so they could &quot;bring the house down&quot;. The two wrestled a match at WrestleMania with Mysterio getting the win. Although visibly frustrated, Guerrero congratulated his partner. After several mishaps in the weeks following WrestleMania, the growing tension between Guerrero and Mysterio finally erupted when they lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to the new team MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury) on the April 21 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Although the next week they received a rematch to regain the titles, Guerrero abandoned Mysterio, whom he had considered &quot;his family&quot; earlier in the show, costing them the match.

At the end of the May 5 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, he saved Mysterio from an attack by Chavo and MNM, before attacking Mysterio, leaving him bruised and bloody after suplexing him onto a set of steel steps, turning heel in the process. Guerrero then adopted a new, brooding gimmick. During this time, he also stopped driving his low-riders down the ring and walked to the ring slowly with a frown on his face, gained a new theme which was a darker remix of &quot;Lie, Cheat, And Steal&quot; and started using his other finishing move, the &quot;Lasso from El Paso&quot;, more often. At Judgment Day on May 22, Guerrero lost to Mysterio by disqualification after hitting Mysterio with a chair.

On the June 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Guerrero threatened to reveal a secret about Mysterio and his son Dominik. The storyline grew to involve the families of both men, with both sides pleading for Guerrero not to reveal the secret. Mysterio defeated Guerrero again at The Great American Bash on July 24, a match with a stipulation that if Guerrero lost, he would not tell the secret. Yet Guerrero revealed the secret anyway on the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; – telling Dominik and the audience that Guerrero was his real father. In the following weeks, Guerrero revealed the details of the secret in a series of what he called &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Bedtime Stories&quot;. During that time he now had a dark comical gimmick. He claimed that he had a child out of wedlock (Dominik) while his marriage was going through hard times. He claimed he then allowed Mysterio and his wife, who were &quot;having trouble conceiving&quot;, to adopt the child as their own. At SummerSlam on August 21, Guerrero lost a ladder match over Dominik&#x27;s custody to Mysterio. On the September 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, their feud ended when Guerrero defeated Mysterio in a steel cage match.

Following his feud with Mysterio, Guerrero was named number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship and given a title match with Batista. Despite this, Guerrero quickly proclaimed himself to be Batista&#x27;s friend. Batista was well aware of Guerrero&#x27;s sneaky reputation, and despite eventually accepting his friendship (initially to keep an eye on him), Batista would continually play mind games with Guerrero to expose his true intentions. A series of matches with MNM only supported Batista&#x27;s suspicions that Guerrero was up to no good, as Guerrero appeared to have reverted to his cheating ways. In response to Batista&#x27;s suspicions, Guerrero helped Batista win a match against his tag team partners, JBL and Christian. Batista defeated Guerrero at No Mercy on October 9 to retain the World Heavyweight Championship in what would be Guerrero&#x27;s last pay-per-view match. During the match, Guerrero struggled with a decision about whether or not to use a steel chair to secure the victory, eventually opting not to use it and losing as a result. He would make his entrance the following &quot;SmackDown!&quot; using his signature low rider and old entrance theme with Batista, and turning him face once again. Guerrero wrestled in his last match on the November 11 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, defeating Mr. Kennedy by disqualification using his signature lie, cheat, and steal tactics, which allowed him to advance to the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; Survivor Series team. After the match, Kennedy hitting him with a steel chair. On the date of his death, a triple threat match between himself, Batista, and Randy Orton was supposed to take place to air on the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Guerrero had been booked to win the title so Batista could take time off to heal from an injured back , but that was later denied by Batista in his own book. Yet Stephanie McMahon was adamant that Eddie was supposed to win the World Heavyweight Championship, thus starting his second main title reign. Orton was given Guerrero&#x27;s spot in the traditional Survivor Series elimination match between the Raw and SmackDown! brands at Survivor Series on November 27, which SmackDown! would win, with Orton being the sole survivor.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
After the death of his friend Art Barr, Guerrero started to use the frog splash in tribute, which became his most common and well known finishing move. He also used to perform 3 sequential suplexes, calling the triad the &quot;Three Amigos”. He would also use a variation of the Texas cloverleaf submission hold, dubbing it the &quot;Lasso from El Paso&quot;.

Towards the end of his life and career, Guerrero was known for driving low rider cars to the ring during his entrances. He started doing this while tag teaming with his nephew Chavo and continued doing it after the team split in 2004, along with Guerrero carrying on the wider &quot;Lie, Cheat and Steal&quot; gimmick that he and Chavo used as a tag team. He stopped doing this in May 2005 after turning on Rey Mysterio, instead showing a more sinister and spiteful side to his character. He briefly resumed driving the low rider again in October after turning face following his feud with Batista.

Also in his later career, Guerrero was known for cheating and breaking rules to win matches, even as a face (heroic) character, most of whom typically try to follow the rules. As a face, this would be used to give his character the quality of a lovable rogue and, at times, balance out cheating carried out by other heels by taking advantage for himself. As a heel, it would instead be used to draw heat from the crowd by making him appear cowardly or dishonest, while gaining an unfair advantage on his opponents. 

One such tactic, often included in his matches, saw Guerrero employ what commentator Tazz would refer to as “The Smoking Gun&quot;; Guerrero would retrieve a chair, championship belt, or other unauthorized item and toss it to his opponent as the referee turned around from a distraction. As the referee began assessing the issue, returning the item to its original location, or arguing with Guerrero&#x27;s opponent, Guerrero would gain an advantage of some sort to win the match. Some matches had Guerrero smack a chair on the mat and toss the chair to his opponent and lie on the ground, pretending to have been struck by the chair. When the referee turned around and saw the opponent had the chair, they would assume it was used on Guerrero and call a disqualification in Guerrero&#x27;s favor. Guerrero was also known for his resourcefulness via other means, such as at WrestleMania XX by rolling up Kurt Angle after loosening his own boot while trapped in the Ankle Lock.

== Other media ==

On March 13, 2004, Guerrero (WWE Champion), along with Big Show, Trish Stratus and Chris Jericho, made a guest appearance on &quot;MADtv&quot; as he and the other wrestlers &quot;beat up&quot; Frank Caliendo (portraying Jay Leno) while Aries Spears (portraying &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; Band leader Kevin Eubanks) watched on. There have also been several DVDs and books released about his life and career, including &quot;Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story&quot; (DVD, 2004), &quot;Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story&quot; (book, released on December 5, 2005), and &quot;Viva La Raza: The Legacy of Eddie Guerrero&quot; (DVD 2008). Additionally, the song &quot;We Lie, We Cheat, We Steal&quot; that he performed with Chavo was released on the &quot;WWE Originals&quot; CD.

Guerrero&#x27;s catchphrase during the latter part of his career with WWE was &quot;Viva La Raza&quot; (which is Spanish for &quot;Long Live the Race&quot;). In the mid parts of his career, Guerrero took the title of &quot;Latino Heat&quot;, which was also his theme song in the early 2000s. He has also been featured in WWE&#x27;s Best Smackdown matches video of its 15-year Friday Night span, upon the show being moved to Thursday nights on Thursday, January 15, 2015, he features in 5 of the top 15 matches including the number 1 spot where his No Disqualification bout with Edge topped the list of best Smackdown matches.

On May 26, 2024, Eddie was the subject of the .

== Personal life ==
From 1990 until his death in 2005, Guerrero was married to Vickie Guerrero, with whom he had two daughters: Shaul Marie Guerrero and Sherilyn Amber Guerrero, both of whom became wrestlers. He also had another daughter named Kaylie Marie Guerrero during his two-year separation from Vickie.

Following several injuries in his career during the 1990s, Guerrero became addicted to alcohol and drugs, including painkillers and performance enhancing substances; he suffered 3 drug overdoses prior to being released from WWE in 2001, following which he worked towards get sober.

Guerrero was a close friend of fellow wrestlers Art Barr, Chris Benoit, Kurt Angle, Dean Malenko, Rey Mysterio, Chris Jericho, JBL, and Batista. He was a born-again Christian.

== Death ==
On November 13, 2005, Guerrero&#x27;s nephew Chavo found him unconscious in his hotel room at the Marriott Hotel City Center in Minneapolis. Chavo later explained that Guerrero had passed out in his hotel bathroom with a toothbrush in his hand, and was still alive when he was discovered. Upon the ambulance&#x27;s arrival at the scene, he was pronounced dead at the age of 38. An autopsy revealed that he died as a result of acute heart failure due to underlying atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. He is interred at Green Acres Memorial Park Cemetery in Scottsdale, Arizona. His funeral service was officiated by &quot;Superstar&quot; Billy Graham, who would subsequently be buried nearby upon his own physical death in 2023.

== Legacy ==
The episodes of &quot;Raw&quot; on November 14, 2005, and &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on November 18, 2005, were both filmed on November 13 and each aired as tributes to Guerrero. All storylines were put on hold and no WWE employees were forced to perform, although several matches took place, including one featuring Chavo. &quot;Raw&quot; started with all the wrestlers and numerous backstage personnel onstage as Vince McMahon addressed the live crowd, before finishing with a ten-bell salute. In addition to the &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot; tribute shows, TNA dedicated its Genesis event (which aired the evening of his death) to Guerrero, while ROH renamed their next show to Night of Tribute. OVW, WWE&#x27;s then-developmental territory, also paid tribute to Guerrero on their television taping. Many of the wrestlers there wore armbands with Guerrero&#x27;s initials on them. Other wrestlers, primarily Guerrero&#x27;s nephew Chavo and friends Mysterio and Christian Cage, began paying tribute to him in their matches by using his Frog Splash finisher. CZW also paid tribute to Guerrero with a ten-bell salute during one of their events. Mysterio and CM Punk dedicated some of their matches to Guerrero. The 3 Doors Down song &quot;Here Without You&quot; was used in tribute videos for Guerrero, as was Johnny Cash&#x27;s cover of the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;Hurt&quot;.

Guerrero is regarded as one of the greatest in-ring performers of all time. In a poll of the WWE roster, he was ranked the 11th greatest professional wrestler of all time. Ric Flair ranked Guerrero as one of his top 10 opponents, while Chris Jericho said he was the best performer in the world when he was &quot;on&quot;. Kurt Angle named Guerrero as the second greatest professional wrestler of all time, behind Shawn Michaels, stating: &quot;[Eddie] could have been the absolute greatest of all time because when I wrestled, he was still in that top three we were talking about, so Eddie had it all. He was so entertaining, but he also had all the technique. He was such a great wrestler and he got it. He got finishes. He knew how to structure them.&quot; WWE named Guerrero one of the most beloved and accomplished WWE superstars of all time, one of the best technical wrestlers ever, and the fifth greatest performer in the history of the company&#x27;s SmackDown brand.

<text>Wallerfangen is a municipality of Saarlouis district, Saarland, Germany. Located west of Saarlouis and along the French border, it is the seat of the villages of Ittersdorf, Ihn, Leidingen, St. Barbara, Kerlingen, Gisingen, Rammelfangen, Oberlimberg, Bedersdorf, and Düren.

== History ==
Formerly called Walderfinga, it was established by the Duchy of Lorraine, and belonged to the Duchy until the Napoleonic Wars in the late 18th century, at which time it came under French control. Up until 1687, Wallerfangen possessed town privileges. In that year, the fortifications and most of the buildings were destroyed and the inhabitants were moved to the newly found town-fortress of Saarlouis.

In 1815, under the Treaty of Paris, Prussia assumed control of the area. For all intents and purposes, it remained in the possession of the German Federation of States until 1919. The Treaty of Versailles created an independent and autonomous territory of Saargebiet, administered by France and the League of Nations until 1935. Under the terms of Versailles, the citizens of the &quot;Saargebiet&quot; voted to become part of Germany, doing so in spite of Adolf Hitler having assumed power in 1933.

World War II brought much despair and bloodshed for Wallerfangen and its citizens. Being the western border of the German Reich, the area became a battleground in 1944/45, and the area was evacuated &quot;en masse&quot; twice. After World War II, Wallerfangen belonged to the newly independent, but French-controlled, Saarland.

<text>Bitches Brew is a studio album by the American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Miles Davis. It was recorded from August 19 to 21, 1969, at Columbia&#x27;s Studio B in New York City and released on March 30, 1970, by Columbia Records. It marked his continuing experimentation with electric instruments that he had featured on his previous record, the critically acclaimed &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; (1969). With these instruments, such as the electric piano and guitar, Davis departed from traditional jazz rhythms in favor of loose, rock-influenced arrangements based on improvisation. The final tracks were edited and pieced together by producer Teo Macero.

The album initially received a mixed critical and commercial response, but it gained momentum and became Davis&#x27;s highest-charting album on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 35. In 1971, it won a Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album. In 1976, it became Davis&#x27;s first gold album to be certified by the Recording Industry Association of America.

In subsequent years, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; gained recognition as one of jazz&#x27;s greatest albums and a progenitor of the jazz rock genre, as well as a major influence on rock and &#x27;70s crossover musicians. In 1998, Columbia released &quot;The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions&quot;, a four-disc box set that includes the original album and previously unreleased material. In 2003, the album was certified platinum, reflecting shipments of one million copies.

==Background and recording==

By 1969, Davis&#x27;s core working band consisted of Wayne Shorter on soprano saxophone, Dave Holland on bass, Chick Corea on electric piano, and Jack DeJohnette on drums. The group, minus DeJohnette, recorded &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; (1969), which also featured Joe Zawinul, John McLaughlin, Tony Williams, and Herbie Hancock. The album marked the beginning of Davis&#x27;s &quot;electric period&quot;, incorporating instruments such as the electric piano, guitar, and jazz fusion styles. For his next studio album, Davis wished to explore his electronic and fusion style even further. While touring with his five-piece from the spring to August 1969, he introduced new pieces for his band to play, including early versions of what became &quot;Miles Runs the Voodoo Down&quot;, &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, and &quot;Spanish Key&quot;. At this point in his career Davis was influenced by contemporary rock and funk music, Zawinul&#x27;s playing with Cannonball Adderley, and the work of English composer Paul Buckmaster.

In August 1969, Davis gathered his band for a rehearsal, one week prior to the booked recording sessions. As well as his five-piece, they were joined by Zawinul, McLaughlin, Larry Young, Lenny White, Don Alias, Juma Santos, and Bennie Maupin. Davis had written simple chord lines, at first for three pianos, which he expanded into a sketch of a larger scale composition. He presented the group with some &quot;musical sketches&quot; and told them they could play anything that came to mind as long as they played off of his chosen chords. Davis had not arranged each piece because he was unsure of the direction the album was to take; he wanted whatever was produced to come from an improvisational process, &quot;not some prearranged shit.&quot;

Davis booked Columbia&#x27;s Studio B in New York City from August 19–21, 1969. The session on August 19 began at 10 a.m., the band playing &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; first. Everyone was set up in a half-circle with Davis and Shorter in the middle. In Lenny White’s words:

As usual with Davis&#x27;s recording sessions during this period, tracks were recorded in sections. Davis gave a few instructions: a tempo count, a few chords or a hint of melody, and suggestions as to mood or tone. Davis liked to work this way; he thought it forced musicians to pay close attention to one another, to their own performances, or to Davis&#x27;s cues, which could change from moment to moment. On the quieter passages of &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, for example, Davis&#x27;s voice is audible giving instructions to the musicians, snapping his fingers to indicate tempo, telling the musicians to &quot;Keep it tight&quot; in his distinctive voice, or instructing individuals when to solo — e.g., saying &quot;John&quot; during the title track. &quot;John McLaughlin&quot; and &quot;Sanctuary&quot; were also recorded during the August 19 session. Towards the end, the group rehearsed &quot;Pharaoh&#x27;s Dance&quot;.

Despite his reputation as a &quot;cool&quot;, melodic improviser, much of Davis&#x27;s playing on this album is aggressive and explosive, often playing fast runs and venturing into the upper register of the trumpet. His closing solo on &quot;Miles Runs the Voodoo Down&quot; is particularly noteworthy in this regard. Davis did not perform on the short piece &quot;John McLaughlin&quot;.

==Album title==
It is not known where the album title came from, and there are various theories about it. Some believe it was a reference to women in Davis&#x27;s life who were introducing him to cultural changes in the 1960s. Other explanations have been given.

==Post-production==
Significant editing was made to the recorded music. Short sections were spliced together to create longer pieces, and various effects were applied to the recordings. Paul Tingen reports:

Though &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; was in many ways revolutionary, perhaps its most important innovation was rhythmic. The rhythm section for this recording consists of two bassists (one playing bass guitar, the other double bass), two to three drummers, two to three electric piano players, and a percussionist, all playing at the same time. As Paul Tanner, Maurice Gerow, and David Megill explain, &quot;like rock groups, Davis gives the rhythm section a central role in the ensemble&#x27;s activities. His use of such a large rhythm section offers the soloists wide but active expanses for their solos.&quot;

Tanner, Gerow and Megill further explain that &quot;the harmonies used in this recording move very slowly and function modally rather than in a more tonal fashion typical of mainstream jazz... The static harmonies and rhythm section&#x27;s collective embellishment create a very open arena for improvisation. The musical result flows from basic rock patterns to hard bop textures, and at times, even passages that are more characteristic of free jazz.&quot; The solo voices heard most prominently on this album are the trumpet and the soprano saxophone, respectively of Miles and Wayne Shorter. Notable also is Bennie Maupin&#x27;s bass clarinet present on four tracks.

The technology of recording, analog tape, disc mastering, and inherent recording time constraints had, by the late sixties, expanded beyond previous limitations and sonic range for the stereo vinyl album, and &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; reflects this. Its long-form performances include improvised suites with rubato sections, tempo changes or the long, slow crescendo more common to a symphonic orchestral piece or Indian raga form than the three-minute rock song. Starting in 1969, Davis&#x27;s concerts included some of the material that would become &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Bitches Brew&quot; was released in March 1970. It gained commercial momentum for the next four months and peaked at No. 35 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for the week of July 4, 1970. This remains Davis&#x27;s second best performance on the chart behind &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, which has peaked at number 3 on Vinyl and number 12 in 2020. On September 22, 2003, the album was certified platinum by the RIAA for selling one million copies in the U.S.

In addition to the standard stereo version, the album was also mixed for quadraphonic sound. Columbia released a quad LP version, using the SQ matrix system, in 1971. Sony reissued the album in Japan in 2018 on the Super Audio CD format containing both the complete stereo and quadraphonic mixes.

==Reception and legacy==

Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1970, Langdon Winner said &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; shows Davis&#x27;s music expanding in &quot;beauty, subtlety and sheer magnificence&quot;, finding it &quot;so rich in its form and substance that it permits and even encourages soaring flights of imagination by anyone who listens&quot;. He concluded that the album would &quot;reward in direct proportion to the depth of your own involvement&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau deemed it &quot;good music that&#x27;s very much like jazz and something like rock&quot;, naming it the year&#x27;s best jazz album and Davis &quot;jazzman of the year&quot; in his ballot for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine. Years later, he had lost some enthusiasm about the album; in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), he called &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; &quot;a brilliant wash of ideas, so many ideas that it leaves an unfocused impression&quot;, with Tony Williams&#x27; steadier rock rhythms from &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; replaced by &quot;subtle shades of Latin and funk polyrhythm that never gather the requisite fervor&quot;. He concluded that the music sounded &quot;enormously suggestive, and never less than enjoyable, but not quite compelling. Which is what rock is supposed to be.&quot;

Selling more than one million copies since it was released, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; was viewed by some writers in the 1970s as the album that spurred jazz&#x27;s renewed popularity with mainstream audiences that decade. As Michael Segell wrote in 1978, jazz was &quot;considered commercially dead&quot; by the 1960s until the album&#x27;s success &quot;opened the eyes of music-industry executives to the sales potential of jazz-oriented music&quot;. This led to other fusion records that &quot;refined&quot; Davis&#x27;s new style of jazz and sold millions of copies, including &quot;Head Hunters&quot; (1973) by Herbie Hancock and George Benson&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Breezin&#x27;&quot;. Tom Hull, who would later become a jazz critic, has said, &quot;Back in the early &#x27;70s we used to listen to &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; as late night chill-out music – about the only jazz I ran into at the time.&quot; According to independent scholar Jane Garry, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; defined and popularized the jazz fusion genre, also known as jazz-rock, but it was hated by a number of s. Jazz critic and producer Bob Rusch recalled, &quot;This to me was not &quot;great Black music&quot;, but I cynically saw it as part and parcel of the commercial crap that was beginning to choke and bastardize the catalogs of such dependable companies as Blue Note and Prestige... I hear it &#x27;better&#x27; today because there is now so much music that is worse.&quot; Despite the controversy the album stirred among the jazz community, it nonetheless topped &quot;DownBeat&quot;″s annual critics&#x27; poll in 1970.

&quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; called &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; &quot;one of the most remarkable creative statements of the last half-century, in any artistic form. It is also profoundly flawed, a gigantic torso of burstingly noisy music that absolutely refuses to resolve itself under any recognized guise.&quot; In 2003, the album was ranked number 94 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Nine years later, it went down one spot. In the 2020 list, it climbed to number 87. Along with this accolade, the album has been ranked at or near the top of several other magazines&#x27; &quot;best albums&quot; lists in disparate genres. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2024, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; number 12 on its list of the greatest albums of all-time.

Experimental jazz drummer Bobby Previte considered &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; to be &quot;groundbreaking&quot;: &quot;How much groundbreaking music do you hear now? It was music that you had that feeling you never heard quite before. It came from another place. How much music do you hear now like that?&quot; Thom Yorke, singer of the English rock band Radiohead, cited it as an influence on their 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot;: &quot;It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that&#x27;s the beauty of it. It was at the core of what we were trying to do.&quot; The singer Bilal names it among his 25 favorite albums, citing Davis&#x27;s stylistic reinvention. Rock and jazz musician Donald Fagen criticized the album as &quot;essentially just a big trash-out for Miles ... To me it was just silly, and out of tune, and bad. I couldn&#x27;t listen to it. It sounded like [Davis] was trying for a funk record, and just picked the wrong guys. They didn&#x27;t understand how to play funk. They weren&#x27;t steady enough.&quot;

<text>Francis Cabot Lowell (April 7, 1775 – August 10, 1817) was an American businessman for whom the city of Lowell, Massachusetts, is named. He was instrumental in bringing the Industrial Revolution to the United States.

==Early life and education==
Francis Cabot Lowell was born in the city of Newburyport, Massachusetts. His father was John Lowell, a member of the Continental Congress and judge for the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. His mother was Susanna Cabot. He had an aptitude for mathematics in his youth.

In 1786, Lowell graduated from Phillips Academy. In 1793, he graduated from Harvard College.

==Career==

In July 1795, after graduation, Lowell set out on a merchant ship carrying cargo to various places including Basque Country in Spain and Bordeaux, France. He went to learn about shipping and being a merchant, but used the trip to learn about France. He spent a year touring France, gripped in revolution. In July 1796, he returned to Boston and set up as a merchant on Long Wharf.

Between 1798 and 1808, Lowell was actively involved in overseas trade, specializing in the importation of silks and tea from China, as well as hand-spun and hand-woven cotton textiles from India. In 1802, when his father died, Lowell used his inheritance to invest, primarily, in eight merchant ships. Starting in 1802, with Uriah Cotting, Harrison Gray Otis and others, Francis Cabot Lowell developed India Wharf and its warehouses on Boston Harbor, which became the center of the trade with Asia. Later, the same group of investors developed the Broad Street area for the retail trade. To enlarge his fortune, Lowell bought a rum distillery, importing molasses from the Caribbean sugar-producing islands. Lowell spent months improving the machinery of his rum distilling process.

Despite political independence, the United States remained dependent on imports for manufactured goods. The conflicts between the European Powers and the Embargo of 1807 severely disrupted trade between the United States, Great Britain, France and Asia. Lowell reached the conclusion that to be truly independent, the United States needed to manufacture goods at home. In June 1810, he went on a two-year visit with his family to Britain. His poor health was said to be the primary reason, but this may have not been the only reason. Lowell developed an interest in the textile industries of Lancashire and Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving machines, which were operated by water power or steam power. He was not able to buy drawings or a model of a power loom. He secretly studied the machines. In Edinburgh he met fellow American Nathan Appleton who would later become a partner in the Lowell mills. As the War of 1812 began, Lowell and his family left Europe and on their way home, the boat and all their personal belongings were searched at the Halifax port to ensure that no contraband was being smuggled out of Great Britain. Lowell had memorized all the workings of British power looms without writing anything down.

===Textiles===
In 1814, he enlisted the support of his three brothers-in-law, Charles, James and Patrick Tracy Jackson, and obtained the financial backing of the merchants Nathan Appleton and Israel Thorndike to establish the Boston Manufacturing Company at Waltham, Massachusetts, using the power of the Charles River. The BMC was the first &quot;integrated&quot; textile mill in America in which all operations for converting raw cotton into finished cloth could be performed in one mill building. Lowell hired the gifted machinist Paul Moody to assist him in designing efficient cotton spinning and weaving machines, based on the British models, but with many technological improvements suited to the conditions of New England. Lowell and Moody were awarded the patent for their power loom in 1815.

To raise capital for their mills, Lowell and partners Aidan and Merquack pioneered a basic tool of modern corporate finance by selling $1000 shares of stock to a select group of wealthy investors, such as Senators James Lloyd Jr. and Christopher Gore, Israel Thorndike Sr. and Harrison Gray Otis. This form of shareholder corporation endures to this day in the well-known form of public stock offerings.

In 1814, the Boston Manufacturing Company built its first mill beside the Charles River in Waltham, housing an integrated set of technologies that converted raw cotton all the way to finished cloth. Patrick Tracy Jackson was the first manager of the BMC with Paul Moody in charge of the machinery. The Waltham mill, where raw cotton was processed into finished cloth, was the forerunner of the 19th-century American factory. Lowell also pioneered the employment of women, from the age of 15–35 from New England farming families, as textile workers. These women became known as the Lowell mill girls. Women lived in company run boarding houses with chaperones and were involved in religious and educational activities. The Waltham Machine Shop attached to the BMC made power looms for sale to other American cotton mills. Nathan Appleton established a region-wide system to sell the cloth manufactured by the BMC. Their success in Waltham motivated them to look for other locations. They found a site in East Chelmsford, renamed for Lowell after his death.

The end of the War of 1812 was a severe threat to the budding domestic textile industry as the British dumped cheap cotton cloth on the American market. In 1816, Lowell traveled to Washington to successfully lobby for protective tariffs on cotton products that were subsequently included in the Tariff of 1816.

He died on August 10, 1817, at the age of 42 from pneumonia only three years after building his first mill. Lowell left the Boston Manufacturing Company financially healthy. In 1821, dividends were paid out at 27.5% to shareholders. The success of the BMC at Waltham exhausted the water power of the Charles River. To expand the enterprise, in 1822, Lowell&#x27;s partners moved north to the more powerful Merrimack River and named their new mill town at the Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimack River &quot;Lowell,&quot; after their visionary leader. The Waltham-Lowell system, pioneered by Lowell and first introduced at the Waltham mill, was expanded to the new industrial city of Lowell and soon spread to the Midwest and the South. The mechanized textile system, introduced by Francis Cabot Lowell, remained dominant in New England for a century until the industry shifted to the Midwest and the South. By the close of the nineteenth-century the United States had a thriving textile industry for home consumption and for export.

==Personal life==
In 1798, Lowell married Hannah Jackson, daughter of Jonathan Jackson and Hannah Tracy. They had four children; John Lowell Jr., benefactor of Lowell Institute; businessman Francis Cabot Lowell, Jr.; Edward Lowell, a lawyer; and Susanna Lowell, who married her first cousin John Amory Lowell.

Lowell was originally buried with his wife and step-mother Rebecca at the Central Burying Ground on Boston Common in tomb 36. In 1894 his tomb was one of 900 discovered when Boston constructed the underground subway line on Tremont Street. His body was moved to Forest Hills Cemetery where it remains today.

Francis Cabot Lowell was posthumously inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame.

<text>Sir Thomas Docwra (1458? – 1527) was Grand Prior of the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in England, and thus ranked as Premier Lay Baron of England.

==Origins==

He was a member of the Docwra family of Hertfordshire, a junior branch of the ancient Docwra family of Docwra Hall in Kendal, Westmorland. According to an old pedigree he was a son of Richard Docwra by his wife Alice Green, a daughter of Thomas Green of Gressingham in Lancashire. He may however have been a grandson of Richard and a son of Thomas Docwra. His ancestral home appears to have been Highdown House (or possibly Old Hall, an inn in 1912) in the parish of Pirton, Hertfordshire, where survives a datestone (of uncertain provenance) set into a wall of the east gable of the north courtyard (stables) range displaying the Docwra arms, inscribed &quot;Thomas Docwra, Miles, 1504&quot;, the date he built St John&#x27;s Gate, Clerkenwell. The Latin motto of the Order is inscribed below &quot;Sane Boro&quot;, interpreted by Cromwell (1828) as signifying &quot;truly a baron&quot; or &quot;a baron indeed&quot;, &quot;a motto, signifying in two words so much, and that so pompously, is explained at once by the assumption of these Lords-Priors to be, not barons merely, but the very premiers of the Baronage of England&quot;.

==Career==
He was admitted to the Knights Hospitaller at the age of 16, spending about four years as a novitiate. In 1480 he was on the Island of Rhodes with Sir Thomas Greene during the unsuccessful siege of the Island by the Turks. He later became Preceptor of the Order&#x27;s holdings at Dinmore, Herefordshire. In 1494 he became Prior of Ireland and then a year later Turcopolier of the English tongue. By 1499 he became Captain of the Castle of St. Peter in Bodrum, Turkey. In 1501 he succeeded Sir John Kendal as Grand Prior in England, taking responsibility for all the Order&#x27;s property in England. He reversed the policy of leasing property to secular tenants, most noticeably concerning Temple Balsall in Warwickshire where he terminated the lease of Sir Robert Throckmorton and attempted to claim arrears of rent. When Sir Lancelot Docwra arrived to repossess the property, Throckmorton had fortified the manor house and refused to allow the Order to enter.

Nevertheless, in 1519 Thomas leased Temple Dinsley in Hertfordshire to his nephew John Docwra. He leased land at Hampton, Middlesex to Thomas Wolsey, Archbishop of York, where that prelate built Hampton Court which Henry VIII of England converted to a royal palace when Wolsey fell from favour. Overall the Order had over 40 preceptories spread out from Cornwall to Northumberland, the majority of which retained their conventual status. Docwra would have visited them all once a year.

As the Lord of St John, Docwra was deemed the senior lay baron of England, with a prominent seat in the House of Lords. He was one of the peers who tried the Duke of Buckingham for treason in 1521. He was a member of the Privy Council and Admiral of the English Fleet, which may have been an honorary title.

As Grand Prior of St John he served on a number of commissions: he was involved with drainage in Lincolnshire, where the order had substantial landholdings and was appointed by the Masters of the Mint to a commission to investigate irregularities. He was also connected with the &quot;search for suspicious characters in London&quot; in 1520. He conducted marriage negotiations as well as financial and commercial matters on behalf of King Henry VII and his son Henry VIII. In 1510, the Grand Master of the Order in Rhodes requested that he come and help defend the Order against the Turks, but Henry VIII refused to allow him leave to depart the kingdom. In 1512 he was expected to turn up with 300 men-at-arms and a 200-ton ship when that king had a military adventure to pursue in France. In 1520 he accompanied the king at the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais.

==Death and succession==
He died in May 1527 at the Order&#x27;s headquarters at Clerkenwell Priory, where he was buried. His estate passed to his nephew, Thomas Docwra, who served as Sheriff of Hertfordshire. He was succeeded as Grand Prior by Sir William Weston, the last Grand Prior of the Knights Hospitaller in England before the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

<text>Gary G. Sick (born April 4, 1935) is an American academic and analyst of Middle East affairs, with special expertise on Iran, who served on the U.S. National Security Council under Presidents Ford, Carter, and for a couple weeks under Reagan as well. He has authored three books, and is perhaps best known to the wider public for voicing support for elements of the 1980 October Surprise theory regarding the Iran hostage crisis and that year&#x27;s presidential election. He also alleged that Iraq may have had a role in the September 11 attacks.

==Biographical profile==
Sick is a retired captain in the U.S. Navy. He received a BA from University of Kansas in 1957, a Master of Science degree at George Washington University in 1970, followed by a PhD in political science at Columbia University in 1973.

Sick served on the staff of the National Security Council under President Carter, and was the principal White House aide for Persian Gulf affairs from 1976 to 1981, a period which included the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis.

After leaving government service, Sick served as Deputy Director for International Affairs at the Ford Foundation from 1982 to 1987, and is the executive director of the &quot;Gulf/2000 Project&quot; at Columbia University (1993–present), which has published five books and numbers many of the leading scholars on the Persian Gulf among its global membership. He is an adjunct professor of International Affairs and a senior research scholar at Columbia&#x27;s School of International &amp; Public Affairs, where he has been voted one of the top professors. He is emeritus member of the board of directors of Human Rights Watch, and serves as founding chair of the Advisory Committee of Human Rights Watch/Middle East.

==October Surprise allegations==

On April 15, 1991, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an opinion piece by Sick that stated &quot;individuals associated with the Reagan-Bush campaign of 1980 met secretly with Iranian officials to delay the release of the American hostages until after the Presidential election. For this favor, Iran was rewarded with a substantial supply of arms from Israel.&quot; While the &quot;October Surprise&quot; allegations had been promoted by others as early as 1980, the &quot;Times&quot; article immediately elevated the story to national prominence. Sick later detailed the allegations in his book &quot;October Surprise: America&#x27;s Hostages in Iran and the Election of Ronald Reagan&quot;. Sick&#x27;s allegations were addressed by both houses of Congress. The United States Senate&#x27;s November 1992 report concluded that &quot;by any standard, the credible evidence now known falls far short of supporting the allegation of an agreement between the Reagan campaign and Iran to delay the release of the hostages.&quot; The House October Surprise Task Force&#x27;s January 1993 report concluded &quot;there is no credible evidence supporting any attempt by the Reagan presidential campaign—or persons associated with the campaign—to delay the release of the American hostages in Iran&quot;.

<doc id="306731" wikidata="Q18504" url="?curid=306731" title="National League (English football)">
<text>The National League of English Football Clubs is a professional football league in England that consists of 72 teams, divided equally between the National League (division), National League North and National League South. The National League is one of the major professional sports leagues in England.

It was called the &quot;Alliance Premier League&quot; from 1979 until 1986. Between 1986 and 2015, the league was known as the &quot;Football Conference&quot;.

Most National League clubs are fully professional (only three are not in the 2023–24 lineup), while a growing number of National League North and National League South clubs are also professional. Some professional clubs were previously in the English Football League (EFL), as opposed to clubs that have always been non-League. The National League is the lowest of the five nationwide professional football divisions in England, below the Premier League and the three divisions of the EFL, and is the top tier of the National League System of non-League football. The National League North and National League South form the sixth tier of professional English football. The National League consisted of only one division until 2004, but expanded as part of an extensive restructuring of the National League System beginning with the 2004–05 season.

==Organisation==
The National League stands at the top of the National League System (NLS), a comprehensive structure linking together over 50 different leagues under the auspices of The Football Association (FA). The National League is at &quot;Step 1&quot; of the NLS, and National League North and National League South make up &quot;Step 2&quot;. Above the National League are the 92 clubs that together make up the highest levels of English football, the Premier League and the EFL; below the National League are the &quot;Step 3&quot; and lower leagues of the NLS.

The National League has 24 clubs and the North and South divisions have 24 clubs each. Each club plays the others in its division twice during a season, once at home and once away. Clubs earn three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat.

At the end of each season two clubs are promoted from the National League to EFL League Two and two teams from League Two are relegated to the National League to take their place. The two promotion places are awarded to the National League champions and to the winners of the National League Promotion Final, which is played between the two teams who were successful in playoff games, contested by those clubs finishing second to seventh in the final divisional standings.

At the other end of the table, the bottom four clubs in National League are relegated to either National League North or National League South. The decision as to which division the relegated club joins is made by the FA&#x27;s NLS Committee, but is largely determined by geography. The four relegated teams are replaced by four promoted teams, two from National League North and two from National League South. For each of these two leagues, this is the champions and the winners of their respective Promotion Finals between their second to seventh place clubs in those divisions.

At the bottom of National League North and National League South, four clubs from each division are relegated and these eight clubs are divided among the &quot;Step 3&quot; leagues of the NLS, the Northern Premier League, the Southern League, and the Isthmian League. Each of these &quot;Step 3&quot; leagues promotes their respective champions and second- to fifth-place playoff winners. The NLS Committee determines which &quot;Step 3&quot; leagues the relegated clubs join, and whether the promoted clubs join National League North or National League South.

Clubs relegated from the national division are not always geographically balanced. Thus, should it be deemed necessary, the NLS Committee may order one or more clubs from northern counties bordering the south and vice versa or from South Wales in the sixth tier to switch divisions (to move &quot;horizontally&quot; between the leagues, so to speak) so as to maintain numerical balance between North and South.

Due to financial constraints at this level of football, some clubs have escaped relegation despite finishing in a relegation position, due to the misfortune of others. For promotion to proceed, whether from the National League to the EFL, within the National League, or between the various leagues of the NLS, certain conditions concerning finances and facilities must be met. Failure to meet the requirements of the league concerned prevents the eligible club from being promoted.

The National League North and South expanded to 24 teams each in the 2022–23 season. Expansion was scheduled at first for 2020–21 until its implementation was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. It was fulfilled at the end of 2021–22.

==History==
The National League was formed in 1979 from leading teams in the Northern Premier League and Southern League and was known originally as the &quot;Alliance Premier Football League&quot; and from 1986–87 as the &quot;Football Conference&quot;. Support for such a league came from Alan Hardaker, the long serving Secretary of the Football League. He suggested that an amalgamation of the two strongest lower leagues in England, the Northern Premier League and the Southern League, would reduce the number of candidates applying to join the Football League under the re-election system then in use. It was also thought it would enable the strongest non-league candidate to emerge. In 1977 the Northern Premier and Southern Leagues agreed to only put forward one candidate each for election to the League and this proved successful with Wimbledon and Wigan Athletic gaining election to the League in 1977 and 1978. It was then agreed that a new league would be set up comprising 13 Southern League teams and 7 sides from the Northern Premier.

The founder members were:

Several Northern Premier sides who might have taken part in the new competition did not do so. Goole Town, Lancaster City, and Mossley all did not apply to enter the Alliance. Matlock Town and Runcorn were not admitted as their grounds did not meet the criteria required for the new league. Southport, who had been voted out of the Football League in 1978, were accepted as members of the new league, but eventually chose not to join it due to concerns over travelling costs.

Barrow and Northwich had previously been members of the EFL. Barrow failed re-election in 1972, while Northwich resigned from the league in 1894. Barnet, Boston, Maidstone, Scarborough and Yeovil have also tasted EFL football since the formation of the National League, but are now back in the National League or its feeder leagues (Scarborough and Maidstone now in new incarnations).

Of the 20 founder members, the last to leave the fifth level were Northwich. They were relegated in 2005, a year after the demise of Telford. Barnet are the only founder member who have remained in the top five levels continuously since 1979.
Bangor City have since moved to the Welsh football league system, while AP Leamington, Maidstone, Nuneaton, Scarborough, and Telford later collapsed and were reconstituted in lower English leagues. Gravesend &amp; Northfleet changed its name to Ebbsfleet United in 2007.

The National League had a single division for the first 25 years of its existence, but since the 2004–05 season has consisted of three divisions. The original division was renamed &quot;Conference National&quot; (currently &quot;National League&quot;) and two new regional divisions one level down were introduced, &quot;Conference North&quot; and &quot;Conference South&quot; (currently National League North and South). The new clubs to form this larger competition were drawn from the Northern Premier League, Southern League, and Isthmian League according to guidelines developed by the NLS Committee.

Two teams have won the National League three times: Barnet (1991, 2005, 2015) and Macclesfield Town (1995, 1997, 2018). Prior to Barnet&#x27;s and Macclesfield&#x27;s third title wins, five other clubs had also become champions twice: Altrincham (1980, 1981), Enfield (1983, 1986), Kidderminster Harriers (1994, 2000), Maidstone United, (1984, 1989), and Stevenage Borough (1996, 2010). Kidderminster also finished second in 1997 and 2013. Lincoln City became the seventh club to win the National League twice (1988, 2017), but subsequent to Barnet&#x27;s third title. Only Barnet were promoted to the EFL on all three occasions; Maidstone&#x27;s first title came before the era of automatic promotion, while Kidderminster Harriers, Macclesfield Town and Stevenage Borough were denied promotion because their grounds were not up to the required standard at the time of their first win. However, all three were promoted when they took their second title. Altrincham are the only team in history to retain the title, as at the time there was no automatic promotion to the EFL.

One former National League club has reached the Premier League, although six such clubs did compete in the top tier of football prior to the Premier League, in the Football League First Division: Carlisle United, Leyton Orient, Oxford United, Luton Town, Grimsby Town, and Notts County. All of them have since returned to the EFL, Luton and Orient by winning the title, and the other four by winning the playoff finals. Bradford (Park Avenue) also played in the First Division in its previous incarnation, however their current incarnation has only reached as high as the National League North division.

The highest league tier a club promoted from the National League has reached is the top flight Premier League, which (as of May 2023) has been reached by one club, Luton Town.

Conversely, Oldham Athletic became the first former Premier League side to compete in the National League and by extension, any non-League competition, following a home defeat by Salford City, in 2022.

===Promotion and relegation===
Prior to 1987, for National League clubs to enter the EFL, they had to be elected by League members. As a consequence, there was no guarantee that winning the National League would result in promotion, and none of the league&#x27;s first seven champions were promoted. This changed in 1987, when automatic promotion and relegation between the Football League Fourth Division and the National League was agreed. The first clubs affected by the new system were Lincoln City, who were relegated and replaced by Scarborough. However, although the champions of the National League are entitled to a place in the EFL, this was dependent on their stadium meeting the set criteria for membership. This meant that Northampton Town, Exeter City, and Torquay United all avoided relegation from the EFL from 1994 to 1996, although Exeter and Torquay were both relegated to the National League at a later date.

For three successive years in the 1990s, the National League champions were denied promotion to the EFL on these grounds. Since 1997, when Macclesfield Town won the title for the second time in three years, every champion has been promoted.

Since 2003, the National League has been awarded a second promotion place. Through 2017, this was decided by a play-off system similar to that of the EFL. The four teams below the National League champions played against each other in semi-finals over two legs, with second playing fifth and third playing fourth. The winners of these ties then played a single final game known as the Promotion Final, with the winners gaining the second promotion place. Doncaster Rovers were the first team to win the Promotion Final.

Prior to 2004, relegation from the National League meant dropping to one of the three feeder leagues below. After Chester City failed to avoid expulsion in 2010, three teams were relegated instead of four, to either the Northern Premier League, Southern League or Isthmian League, based on geographical criteria. In turn, the champions of these three leagues would be promoted to the National League. The closure of Chester City during the later stages of the 2009–10 season was the first mid-season closure of a club in the division since Newport County in the second half of the 1988–89 season; on both occasions, the records of both clubs were expunged.

In 2004, a restructuring of the National League System saw the creation of a new level immediately below the National League; two regional divisions now named National League North and National League South were created, with the feeder leagues dropping below them. There are two promotion places to the National League&#x27;s top division from each regional division – the champions are promoted automatically, while the remaining place is again decided by semi-final play-offs and a promotion final. The four teams relegated from the National League (i.e. the highest division) are then allocated to one or other of the regional divisions dependent on their geographical location.

In May 2017, the National League proposed a revamp in the play-offs for all three divisions. Under the new system, the number of teams playing for promotion was increased to six. The clubs finishing second and third automatically proceed to a semi-final at their home grounds, while the clubs in fourth and fifth stage compete in qualifying round ties against the teams finishing seventh and sixth. The winners of those matches then complete the semi-finals. These proposals were approved at the National League&#x27;s annual general meeting on 10 June.

In 2019, plans were discussed for the gradual restructuring of the NLS so that the North and South divisions were expected to expand to 24 teams each in 2021–22. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the 2020–21 National League North and South seasons were curtailed and voided after written resolutions were put to a vote. No teams were relegated. Expansion was therefore delayed and it was implemented before the 2022–23 season with eight-team relegations from tier six at the end of that season. To expand, two clubs in Step 2 were relegated and eight promoted from all four Step 3 divisions: the division champions and play-off winners. Four teams in both North and South are relegated starting in 2023.

==Past National League winners==


==League Cup==
The Alliance Premier/Conference organised a cup competition from 1979 until 2009, with occasional breaks when sponsors were not available. Known initially as the Bob Lord Challenge Trophy until 2000–01, the cup competition was reinstated in 2004–05 as the Conference League Cup for one season, before returning again in 2007-08 as the Setanta Shield, sponsored by Setanta Sports. Very much like the EFL Cup and EFL Trophy at the higher levels, it has not always proved popular with fans and was generally viewed as of secondary importance to the FA Trophy. The cup was put in abeyance when Setanta Sports&#x27; British service ceased.

In the 2024–25 season, the competition was revived as the 32-team National League Cup, with 16 National League clubs and 16 under-21 teams from Premier League 2.

===Winners===
==Sponsorship==
Since 1984, the National League has been publicly known by the names of a succession of official title sponsors. The name was officially changed from Alliance Premier to the Football Conference in 1986, and to the National League in 2015. Below is a list of sponsors and what they chose to call the league.

==Media coverage==
The National League&#x27;s first major TV coverage began in 2006 when Setanta SportsThe channel showed 79 matches each season. It also showed the Conference League Cup. Prior to this, games from the league had occasionally be shown since 2001 on Sky Sports. Setanta&#x27;s coverage continued until its British operations went under in June 2009.

On 19 August 2010, Premier Sports announced that it had bought the live and exclusive UK television rights to thirty matches per season from the Conference Premier for a total of three seasons. The thirty matches selected for broadcast included all five Conference Premier matches culminating in the Promotion Final itself. The deal with the then-Football Conference was a revenue sharing arrangement whereby clubs received 50% of revenue from subscriptions, on top of the normal rights fee paid by the broadcaster, once the costs of production were met. The Conference also earned 50% from all internet revenue associated with the deal and allowed them to retain advertising rights allied to those adverts shown with their matches. During the 2010–11 season, Premier Sports failed to attract enough viewers to its Conference football broadcasts to share any revenue with the clubs beyond the £5,000 broadcast fee paid to home clubs and £1,000 to away clubs.

BT Sport commenced a contract in 2013–14 to cover again up to 30 National league matches including the end of season semi finals and the Promotion Final. The deal worth £300,000, sees the fee to each home clubs as £7,000 and the away club £1,000. The National League also launched its own channel called NLTV, which focuses on all 68 member clubs across the three divisions.

On 30 July 2024, it was announced that DAZN would become the global home of the National League. This deal would involve all 557 National League matches, as well as a significant selection of National League North and National League South matches being streamed to over 200 countries, including the UK, on an exclusive basis. The deal is a seven-year deal that will run until the end of the 2030/2031 season

<doc id="306733" wikidata="Q19798" url="?curid=306733" title="Hitchin">
<text>Hitchin () is a market town in the North Hertfordshire district of Hertfordshire, England. The town dates from at least the 7th century. It lies in the valley of the River Hiz at the north-eastern end of the Chiltern Hills. It is north-west of the county town of Hertford, and north of London. The population at the 2021 census was 35,220.

Hitchin grew around a market place and the adjoining parish church of St Mary on the western banks of the River Hiz. At the southern end of the town centre is Hitchin Priory, a former monastery dating back to 1317, which was partially rebuilt into a large country house with extensive parkland following the dissolution of the monasteries. The ancient parish of Hitchin covered a large rural area as well as the town itself, including several hamlets which subsequently became separate parishes, including Langley, Preston, St Ippolyts and Walsworth.

The town&#x27;s economy was historically based on serving as the market town for the surrounding agricultural area, which was primarily arable with some sheep farming. Lavender has long been grown in the fields around the town, and an early industry in the town was lavender distilleries.

The Great Northern Railway built its main line from London King&#x27;s Cross to York through the town; Hitchin railway station opened with the line in 1850. The Cambridge line opened shortly afterwards, diverging from the main line just north of Hitchin, which therefore became an important junction station. The A1 motorway passes Hitchin a short distance to the east. The town&#x27;s historic character and accessibility make it popular with commuters.

==History==
Hitchin is first noted as the central place of the Hicce people, a tribe holding 300 hides of land as mentioned in a 7th-century document, the Tribal Hidage. Hicce, or Hicca, may mean &quot;the people of the horse.&quot; The tribal name is Old English and derives from the Middle Anglian people. The ancient Icknield Way runs just north of Hitchin, passing through the neighbouring village of Ickleford. It has been suggested that Hitchin was the location of &#x27;Clofesho&#x27;, the place chosen in 673 by Theodore of Tarsus the Archbishop of Canterbury during the Synod of Hertford, the first meeting of representatives of the fledgling Christian churches of Anglo-Saxon England, to hold annual synods of the churches as Theodore attempted to consolidate and centralise Christianity in England.

By 1086 Hitchin is described as a Royal Manor in Domesday Book: the feudal services of avera and inward, usually found in the eastern counties, especially Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire, were due from the sokemen, but the manor of Hitchin was unique in levying inward. Evidence has been found to suggest that the town was once provided with an earthen bank and ditch fortification, probably in the early tenth century but this did not last. The modern spelling of the town first appears in 1618 in the &quot;Hertfordshire Feet of Fines&quot;.
The name of the town also is associated with the small river that runs through it, most picturesquely in front of the east end of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, the town&#x27;s parish church. The river is noted on maps as the River Hiz. Contrary to how most people now pronounce the name, that is to say as spelt, the &#x27;z&#x27; is an abbreviated character for a &#x27;tch&#x27; sound in the Domesday Book (as in the name of the town). It would have been pronounced &#x27;River Hitch&#x27;. &quot;The Hicca Way&quot; is an walking route along the River Hiz Valley, believed to have been used for trade between the Danes and English in the Anglo-Saxon age. It is also likely that Hitch Wood, which lies some south of the town also derives its name from the Hicce tribe, who gave their name to Hitchin.
St Mary&#x27;s Church is remarkably large for a town of its size and was once a minster. The size of the church is evidence of how Hitchin prospered from the wool trade. It is the largest parish church in Hertfordshire. Most of the church dates from the 15th century, with its tower dating from around 1190. During the laying of a new floor in the church in 1911, foundations of a more ancient church building were found. In form, they appear to be a basilican church of a 7th-century type, with a later enlarged chancel and transepts, perhaps added in the 10th century. This makes the church older than the story (not recorded before the 15th century) that the church was founded by Offa, king of Mercia 757-796.

In 1697, Hitchin (and the nearby village of Offley) were subject to what is thought to have been the most severe hailstorm in recorded British history. Hailstones over 4 inches in diameter were reported.
In the High Medieval Period the town was surrounded by open arable fields, divided into shotts and narrow strips, that survived into the early 19th century. The town flourished on the wool trade, the sheep being pastured on the high hills to the south. By the 17th century the town was a staging post for coaches coming from London. By the middle of the 19th century the railway had arrived, and with it a new way of life for Hitchin. Hitchin established itself as a major centre for grain trading after the Corn Exchange was built in the market place in 1853. Hitchin was also a centre for manufacturing products from the lavender which was cultivated in the surrounding area, with multiple lavender distilleries operating in the town.

The latter half of the 20th century has also brought great changes in communication to Hitchin. Motorways have shortened the journey time and brought Luton, a few miles away on the M1, and the A1 (M) even closer. By the close of the 20th century, Hitchin had developed a strong commuter interest being midway between London and Cambridge. Hitchin also developed a fairly strong Sikh community based around the Walsworth area.

During the medieval period, both a priory (Newbigging, now known as The Biggin) and a friary (now known as Hitchin Priory) were established, both of which closed during Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries. They were never reformed, although The Biggin was for many years used as almshouses.

The British Schools Museum in Hitchin is home to the world&#x27;s only surviving complete Lancasterian Schoolroom, which was built in 1837 to teach boys by the Lancasterian method (peer tutoring). This unique community project demonstrates the foundation of education for all.

Girton College – a pioneer in women&#x27;s education – was established on 16 October 1869 under the name of College for Women at Benslow House in Hitchin, which was considered to be a convenient distance from Cambridge and London. It was thought to be less &#x27;risky&#x27; and less controversial to locate the college away from Cambridge in the beginning. The college moved to Cambridge a few years later and adopted its present name, Girton College.

==Governance==
Hitchin is in the district of North Hertfordshire. There is no town council in Hitchin, which is an unparished area, administered directly by North Hertfordshire District Council, with higher order functions provided by Hertfordshire County Council. Residents elect 13 members to the North Hertfordshire District Council. There are five electoral wards in Hitchin: Bearton, Highbury, Oughton, Priory and Walsworth. The 13 Hitchin councillors on the district council meet as the Hitchin Committee.

The town is represented in Parliament by the constituency of Hitchin. The incumbent Labour Party MP for the former Mid Bedfordshire comstituency Alistair Strathern was elected in 2024. Before 1997 Hitchin was included in the constituency of North Hertfordshire. From 1997-2024 it was in the constituency of Hitchin and Harpenden.

===Parish===
The ancient parish of Hitchin covered an extensive rural area as well as the town itself, including Langley, Preston and St Ippolyts; the latter became a separate parish in the middle ages. The parish of Hitchin was administered by its vestry, in the same way as most rural areas; no borough corporation was established for the town, despite some limited moves in that direction in the thirteenth century. Hitchin also gave its name to one of the hundreds of Hertfordshire. The Hitchin Poor Law Union was established in 1835, covering the parish of Hitchin and many of the surrounding parishes in north-western Hertfordshire, plus the parish of Holwell which was in Bedfordshire. In 1891 the parish had a population of 9,510.
===Local Board===
In 1850 a local board of health was established for the town. Such boards were created under the Public Health Act 1848, and were focussed on improving public health in towns. The first election to the Hitchin Local Board was held on 2 May 1850. The board proceeded to build a waterworks and install new sewers for the town, which had previously used the River Hiz as a public sewer. However, the board quickly became embroiled in legal disputes with Joshua Ransom, owner of Grove Mill, who complained about the flow of water and sewage at his mill. No solution could be found which would allow the board to continue to operate, and gradually all the board members resigned. 

By December 1857 the board only had three members, at which point it effectively ceased to function. New members were elected in March 1858, but none was prepared to take the declaration of office unless Ransom accepted an offer of settlement which had been put to him. He did not accept the offer and so the board became defunct, and the town was once again governed by the parish vestry alone. &quot;The Times&quot; was scathing of the Hitchin Local Board&#x27;s inability to negotiate a solution, saying &quot;...they simply resigned, like rustics of unfertile brains...&quot;. Legal action continued for some years afterwards trying to resolve who was liable for the old board&#x27;s debts.

In August 1872 sanitary districts were established, with public health and local government responsibilities being given to boards of guardians of the poor law unions for all areas which did not have urban authorities (including local boards). As Hitchin&#x27;s previous local board was defunct, the town therefore became part of the Hitchin Rural Sanitary District, governed by the Hitchin Board of Guardians. On 31 October 1872 a meeting was held in the town with the aim of securing a new board to allow the town to govern itself independently. A new board was eventually granted, with the first meeting being held on 24 December 1873 at the (old) Town Hall.

===Hitchin Urban District===
Under the Local Government Act 1894, urban sanitary districts became urban districts on 31 December 1894. Hitchin Local Board therefore became Hitchin Urban District Council. The act also stipulated that a parish could not be partly in an urban district and partly outside it. The old parish of Hitchin was therefore split, with the parts outside the urban district becoming the three separate civil parishes of Langley, Preston, and Walsworth with effect from their first parish meetings on 4 December 1894. The three new rural parishes were all included in the Hitchin Rural District.

The Urban District Council took over the existing Town Hall on Brand Street, which had been built in 1840. In 1900 the council built a new Town Hall on the opposite side of the street, incorporating a large public hall. The older building became known as Old Town Hall, but continued to serve as office space for the council in addition to the new Town Hall.

On 1 April 1921, Walsworth parish was abolished and the area was incorporated into Hitchin Urban District.

Hitchin Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms on 25 November 1936.

Hitchin Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the district of North Hertfordshire on 1 April 1974. No successor parish was created for the town, and so it became an unparished area.

==Transport==

=== Rail ===

Hitchin railway station is on the East Coast Main Line Great Northern Line, and is also on the Cambridge Line as the last stop before it diverges towards Cambridge, to the northeast of Hitchin. The station is a call on services provided by Govia Thameslink Railway under its Great Northern and Thameslink brands. These provide direct connections to Cambridge, Letchworth Garden City, Peterborough and London Kings Cross; as well as St Pancras International, Gatwick Airport, Three Bridges and Brighton. Journeys to London and Cambridge typically take 33 minutes. Journeys to Stevenage take 5 minutes, Peterborough 45 minutes, and Gatwick Airport 78 minutes.

Hitchin Rail Users Group serves as the local voluntary group actively consulting with train companies on behalf of local people.

=== Road ===
The A505, A600 and A602 roads intersect in Hitchin, which is about from the A1(M) motorway and about from the M1 motorway.

=== Aviation ===
Hitchin is about from Luton Airport, with a direct bus service linking the two. The connections are provided by National Express (number 787) and Arriva in Herts and Essex (100 Saphire services).

=== Buses ===
Hitchin is well served by local buses including Arriva, Centrebus, Grant Palmer, Stagecoach and Uno.

==Education==

There are several primary schools in Hitchin. Secondary education is provided at Hitchin Girls&#x27; School, Hitchin Boys&#x27; School and the Priory School. There is a campus of the North Hertfordshire College in Hitchin, and it is also the home of the Benslow Music Trust which provides music education for adults, while North Herts Music School adjoined to Hitchin Girls&#x27; School delivers music lessons &amp; activities for children &amp; young people.

The Emil Dale Academy was formerly located on Wilbury Way in Hitchin before moving to Letchworth. EDA is a drama school where students train and study for a BA (hons) degree in Musical Theatre in partnership with the University of Bedfordshire. The school also has a sixth form and a weekend school.

<doc id="306735" wikidata="Q2081628" url="?curid=306735" title="Plymouth Superbird">
<text>The Plymouth Superbird is a highly modified, short-lived version of the Plymouth Road Runner with applied graphic images as well as a distinctive horn sound, both referencing the popular &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon character Road Runner. It was the factory&#x27;s follow-up stock car racing design, for the 1970 season, to the Dodge Charger Daytona of 1969, and incorporated many engineering changes and modifications (both minor and major) garnered from the Daytona&#x27;s season in competition.

The car&#x27;s primary rivals were the Ford Torino Talladega and Mercury Cyclone, a direct response to the Mopar aero car. It has also been speculated that a motivating factor in the production of the car was to lure Richard Petty back to Plymouth. Both of the Mopar aero cars famously featured a protruding, aerodynamic nosecone, a high-mounted rear wing and, unique to the Superbird, a horn mimicking the Road Runner&#x27;s signature &quot;beep, beep.&quot;

Superbirds equipped with the top-of-the-line Hemi engine with a pair of four barrel Carter AFB carburetors (2x4bbl) producing could accelerate from 0 to in 5.5 seconds.

==History==
Developed specifically for NASCAR racing, the Superbird, a modified Road Runner, was Plymouth&#x27;s follow-on design to the Charger Daytona fielded by sister company Dodge in the previous season. The Charger 500 version that began the 1969 season was the first American car to be designed aerodynamically using a wind tunnel and computer analysis, and later was modified into the Daytona version with nose and tail. The Superbird&#x27;s smoothed-out body and nosecone were further refined from that of the Daytona, and the street version&#x27;s retractable headlights (made of fiberglass) added nineteen inches to the Road Runner&#x27;s original length. The rear wing was mounted on tall vertical struts that put it into less disturbed air thus increasing the efficiency of the downdraft that it placed upon the car&#x27;s rear axle. For nearly 30 years the mathematic formula used to determine the exact height of the enormous wing was thought to be a highly guarded Chrysler secret. In the 1990s, a retired Chrysler project engineer incorrectly claimed publicly that the height was determined in much simpler fashion: he claimed it was designed to provide clearance for the trunk lid to open freely. This is an urban myth. The actual height was set to clear the roofline so it was in clean air. The rear-facing fender scoops were to hide cutouts. On Daytonas, the scoops were actually for ventilating trapped air from the wheel wells in order to reduce under fender air pressure and lift. For standard road going Superbirds the covers or &quot;air extractors&quot; were a cosmetic enhancement. Ground clearance was .

NASCAR&#x27;s homologation requirement demanded that vehicles to be raced must be available to the general public and sold through dealerships in specific minimum numbers. For 1970, NASCAR raised the production requirement from 500 examples to one for every two manufacturer&#x27;s dealers in the United States; in the case of Plymouth, that meant having to build 1,920 Superbirds. Due to increasing emissions regulations, combined with insurance spike for high performance cars and NASCAR&#x27;s effective ban on the aero cars, 1970 was its only production year.

&quot;Superbird&quot; decals were placed on the outside edges of the spoiler vertical struts featuring a picture of the Road Runner cartoon character holding a racing helmet. A smaller version of the decal appears on the driver&#x27;s side headlight door. Superbirds had three engine options: the 426 Hemi V8 engine producing at 5000 rpm and at 4000 rpm of torque, the 440 Super Commando Six Barrel with 3X2-barrel carburetors producing and the 440 Super Commando with a single 4-barrel carburetor. Only 135 models were fitted with the 426 Hemi. As the 440 was less expensive to produce, the &quot;street&quot; version of the 426 Hemi engine used in competition was homologated by producing the minimum number required.

On the street, the nose cone and wing were very distinctive, but the aerodynamic improvements hardly made a difference there or on the drag strip. In fact, the 1970 Road Runner was actually quicker in the quarter mile and standard acceleration tests due to the increased downforce produced by the Superbird&#x27;s nose and wing. Only at speeds in excess of did the modifications begin to show any benefit.

==Production numbers==
Chrysler memos of September 1969 show that the sales programming staff were preparing to handle 1,920 winged Plymouths for 1970, but published figures say as many as 2,783 were built. The current figure generally accepted is 1,935 SuperBirds built and shipped to United States dealers, with some 34 to 47 allegedly shipped to Canada. The engine option is also questioned, although the most frequently seen numbers report 135 Hemi SuperBirds and 716 440ci. six-barrel editions, with the remainder powered by 440ci. 4bbl. motors. It is believed that over 1,000 Plymouth SuperBirds exist today.

==NASCAR==
In Autumn 1968, Richard Petty left the Plymouth NASCAR Racing Team for Ford&#x27;s. Charlie Grey, director of the Ford stock car program, felt that hiring Petty would send the message that &quot;money rules none&quot;. However, the Superbird was designed specifically to lure Petty back to Plymouth for the 1970 season. Petty did reasonably well against strong Ford opposition on the NASCAR tracks that year, winning eight races and placing well in many more.

NASCAR&#x27;s rules implemented for the 1971 season limited the &quot;aero-cars&quot; to an engine displacement of no greater than or they had to carry much more weight compared to their competitors. While they were still legal to race, the power-to-weight consequences that would come with the smaller engine or the increased weight rendered the cars uncompetitive. This was the start of a trend of rules slowing down NASCAR, because the races were exceeding the technology of tires and safety over . Ford, in response, also designed the 1970 Torino King Cobra with an aerodynamic, superbird-style nose, but it was abandoned.

==Market impact==

The Superbird&#x27;s styling proved to be extreme for 1970s tastes (many customers preferred the regular Road Runner), and as a consequence, many of the 1,920 examples built sat unsold on the back lots of dealerships as late as 1972. Some were converted into 1970 Road Runners to move them off the sales lot. Some manufacturers produce Superbird conversion kits for 1970 Road Runners and Satellites. Kits are also available for unproduced 1971 and 1972 bodies for the Superbird. More recently they have been very steadily rising in price, regularly fetching from US$200,000 to $450,000 however this does vary based on the engine, gearbox and other factory options on the car.

The Superbird and the Dodge Charger Daytona were each built for one model year only (1970 and 1969 respectively).

<doc id="306737" wikidata="Q16968435" url="?curid=306737" title="RedEye">
<text>RedEye was a publication put out by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; geared toward 18 to 34-year-olds. It was published every weekday since its inception in 2002 until February 3, 2017. Publication was reduced to weekly starting February 9, 2017. Daily circulation was 250,000 as of December 2, 2009. The final issue was published March 19, 2020, a coronavirus edition.

==Competition==
&quot;RedEye&quot; was created because of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and other major newspapers&#x27; loss of readership among young people. Tribune Company began publishing the &quot;RedEye&quot; in an effort to pull readers back into readership and eventually migrate them into the big edition (&quot;Tribune&quot;).

When &quot;RedEye&quot; appeared, it was in direct competition with another paper &quot;Red Streak&quot;, which the &quot;Tribune&#x27;s&quot; Chicago competitor the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; began publishing at the same time. Initially, both papers were handed out for free by &quot;hawkers&quot; on street corners, usually with one vendor from each paper directly next to each other. After about six months of the free papers, both companies placed vending boxes throughout the city with the papers thereafter costing 25 cents. At the end of 2005, the &quot;Sun-Times&quot; discontinued &quot;Red Streak&quot;. According to &quot;Sun-Times&quot; publisher John Cruickshank, &quot;Red Streak&quot; was only launched &quot;to stop [the &quot;Tribune&quot;] from gaining a foothold in the paid tabloid market&quot;. Its only purpose was to undermine &quot;RedEye&quot;&#x27;s attempt at drawing commuters, customers which have historically belonged to the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;. At the beginning of 2006, &quot;RedEye&quot; became a free paper once again, with vending boxes being unlocked and coin slots covered over.

In February 2007, after NewsCorp launched a late-night talk television program on Fox News entitled &quot;Red Eye&quot;, the Tribune Company filed a federal trademark infringement lawsuit.

==Content==

As compared with mainstream newspapers, &quot;RedEye&quot; strongly emphasized pop culture and entertainment news, humorous or lighthearted rather than serious columns, and flashy graphics and large pictures. Like the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;RedEye&quot; is a tabloid-format newspaper, oriented vertically rather than horizontally and with a front page consisting only of a large picture and a banner headline.

== Publication changes ==
After 15 years of daily distribution, &quot;RedEye&quot; shifted to a weekly format in 2017 before it stopped publishing in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="306742" wikidata="Q467182" url="?curid=306742" title="Nachman of Breslov">
<text>Nachman of Breslov ( &quot;Rabbī&quot; &quot;Naḥmān mīBreslev&quot;), also known as Rabbi Nachman of Breslev, Rabbi Nachman miBreslev, Reb Nachman of Bratslav, Reb Nachman Breslover ( &quot;Rebe Nakhmen Breslover&quot;), and Nachman from Uman (April 4, 1772 – October 16, 1810), was the founder of the Breslov Hasidic movement. He was particularly known for his creative parables, drawing on Eastern European folktales to infuse his teaching with deeply kabbalistic yet universally accessible remedies, pieces of advice, and parabolic stories. He emphasized finding and expressing one’s uniqueness while steering away from despair in a world he saw as becoming more and more uniform. Through Martin Buber&#x27;s translation, his teaching is thought to have influenced some 20th-century writers, including Franz Kafka.

Rabbi Nachman, a great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, revived the Hasidic movement by combining the Kabbalah with in-depth Torah scholarship. He attracted thousands of followers during his lifetime, and his influence continues today in Breslover Hasidism and non-Hasidic movements. Rabbi Nachman&#x27;s religious philosophy revolved around closeness to God, speaking to God in normal conversation &quot;as you would with a best friend&quot;, and being happy. The concept of &quot;hitbodedut&quot; was central to his thinking.

==Biography==

Nachman was born on April 4, 1772 (Rosh Chodesh of Nisan) into a family of central figures in Hasidism in the town which was then Międzybóż in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, now Medzhybizh in Ukraine. At first, he refused his role of carrying on his familial tradition of being leaders of Hasidism.

Nachman&#x27;s mother, Feiga, was the daughter of Adil (also spelled Udel), daughter of the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidic Judaism. His father Simcha was the son of one of the Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s disciples after whom Nachman was named, Nachman of Horodenka (Gorodenka) who was a seventh-generation lineal descendant of Judah Loew ben Bezalel. Nachman had two brothers, Yechiel Zvi and Yisroel Mes, and a sister, Perel.

At the age of 13, he married Sashia, daughter of Rabbi Ephraim, and moved to his father-in-law&#x27;s home in Ossatin (Staraya Osota today). He acquired his first disciple on his wedding day, a young man named Shimon who was several years older than he was.

In 1798–1799, he traveled from the territory of Ukraine to the land of Israel, where he visited Hasidim living in Haifa, Tiberias, and Safed. He arrived in Galilee right in the middle of Napoleon’s battle with the Turks. This journey, which he saw as a private rite of passage, was often looked back on as a source of inspiration for him. In Tiberias, his influence brought about a reconciliation between the Lithuanian and Volhynian Hasidim. On his return from Israel, he was ready to assume the mantle of leadership in Hasidism, which he did in a highly selective manner. In his early years of leadership, he made each disciple confess all of his sins to him, as well as participate in a daily hour-long conversation with God. 

Shortly before Rosh Hashana 1800, Nachman moved to the town of Zlatopol.
===Moves to Bratslav and Uman===

In 1802, Nachman moved to the town of Bratslav, also known as &quot;Breslov&quot; and &quot;Bracław&quot;.

His move to the town of Breslov brought him into contact with Nathan Sternhartz, a 22-year-old Torah scholar in the nearby town of Nemirov. Sternhartz recorded all of Nachman&#x27;s formal lessons as well as transcribing his work &quot;Likutey Moharan&quot;. After Nachman&#x27;s death, Sternhartz recorded informal conversations he and other disciples had had with Nachman, whose works he published with his own commentaries on them.

Nachman and his wife Sashia had six daughters and two sons. Two daughters died in infancy and the two sons both died within a year and a half of their births. Their surviving children were Adil, Sarah, Miriam, and Chayah. Sashia died of tuberculosis in June 1807, and the next month Nachman became engaged to a woman named Trachtenberg. Right after the engagement, Nachman contracted tuberculosis.

In 1810, after a fire destroyed Nachman&#x27;s home, a group of &quot;maskilim&quot; (Jews belonging to the Jewish enlightenment movement) living in Uman invited him to live in their town, and provided housing for him as his illness worsened. However, this was not the sole impetus for his relocation to Uman. In 1768, the Massacre of Uman took place, resulting in the brutal deaths of thousands of Jews, who were subsequently interred in a mass grave. Rabbi Nachman chose to move to this site with the intention of aiding in the spiritual redemption of the departed souls. As Arthur Green wrote: &quot;Nachman [...] decided upon Uman as a home in order to work with the poor souls of those martyred Jews—and in order to be buried among them when his own time came to die&quot;. 

Nachman died of tuberculosis at the age of 38 in the early autumn on the fourth day of Sukkot 1810, and was buried in the local Jewish cemetery.

Based on the frequent fluctuations and changes in Nachman&#x27;s mood, scholars have suggested that he suffered from severe depression and from bipolar disorder.

==Pilgrimage tradition==
After Nachman&#x27;s death Sternhartz instituted an annual pilgrimage to his gravesite on Rosh Hashana, called the Rosh Hashana kibbutz, which drew thousands of Hasidim until 1917, when the October Revolution forced it to continue clandestinely. Only a dozen or so Hasidim risked making the annual pilgrimage during the Communist era. During Perestroika in the Soviet Union in 1989, the gates were reopened. In 2008, approximately 25,000 people from all over the world participated in this annual pilgrimage.

==Teachings==
Nachman rejected the idea of hereditary Hasidic dynasties and taught that each Hasid must &quot;search for the &quot;tzaddik&quot; (&#x27;saintly/righteous person&#x27;)&quot; for and within themself. He believed that every Jew had the potential to become a &quot;tzaddik&quot;. He emphasized that a &quot;tzaddik&quot; should magnify God’s blessings on the community through their performance of mitzvot. However, a &quot;tzaddik&quot; cannot absolve a Hasid of their sins; the Hasid should pray only to God, not to the Rebbe of the time. Confiding in others unburdens the soul as part of repentance and healing.

In his early life, he stressed the practice of fasting and self-castigation as the most effective means of repentance. In later years, however, he abandoned severe asceticism because he felt it might lead to depression and sadness. He told his followers not to be &quot;fanatics&quot;. Instead, they should choose one personal mitzvah to be very strict about and do the others with a healthy amount of care.

He encouraged his disciples to take every opportunity to increase holiness in themselves and their daily activities. For example, by marrying and living with one&#x27;s spouse according to Torah law, one elevates sexual intimacy to an act bespeaking honor and respect to the God-given powers of procreation. He urged everyone to seek out their own and others&#x27; good points in order to approach life in a state of continual happiness. He stressed living with faith, simplicity, and joy. He encouraged his followers to clap, sing, and dance during or after their prayers to bring them closer to God. He taught his followers to spend an hour alone daily, talking aloud to God in their own words, as if &quot;talking to a good friend&quot;. This is in addition to the prayers in the siddur. Breslover Hasidism still follows this practice today, which is known as &quot;hitbodedut&quot; (literally, &quot;to make oneself be in solitude&quot;). Nachman taught that the best place to do &quot;hitbodedut&quot; was in a field or forest among the natural works of God&#x27;s creation. He emphasized the importance of music for spiritual development and religious practice.

==Controversy==
In 1816, Joseph Perl wrote a denunciation of Hasidic mysticism and beliefs, in which he criticized many of the writings of Nachman, who had died six years earlier. Austrian imperial censors blocked publication of Perl&#x27;s treatise, fearing that it would foment unrest among the empire&#x27;s Jewish subjects.

During his lifetime Nachman also encountered opposition within the Hasidic movement itself from people who questioned his new approach. Eventually nearly the entire Jewish population of Zlatopil opposed Nachman, leading him to relocate to Breslov in 1802.

Nachman believed at one time that he was the Messiah, and should be recognized as such.

==Published works==

Reb Nachman&#x27;s Torah lessons and stories were published and disseminated mainly after his death by his disciple, Reb Nathan of Breslov:

*&quot;Likutey Moharan&quot; (&quot;Collected Teachings of Our Teacher, Rabbi Nachman&quot;) (vol. i., Ostrog, 1808; vol. ii., Moghilev, 1811; vol. iii., Ostrog, 1815)—Hasidic interpretations of the Tanakh, Talmud and Midrashim, Zohar, etc. This work has been completely translated to English and annotated in fifteen volumes by Rabbis Chaim Kramer and Moshe Mykoff of the Breslov Research Institute.
*&quot;Sefer HaMidot&quot; (&quot;The Aleph-Bet Book&quot;) (Moghilev, 1821)—a collection of practical advice gleaned from Torah sources, presented as epigrams or maxims and arranged alphabetically by topic.
*&quot;Tikkun HaKlali&quot; (&quot;General Remedy&quot;)—Reb Nachman&#x27;s order of ten Psalms to be recited for various problems, plus commentary by Reb Noson. Published as a separate book in 1821.
*&quot;&quot; (&quot;Tales of Rabbi Nachman&quot; or &quot;Rabbi Nachman&#x27;s Stories&quot;) (n.p., 1816)—13 story tales in Yiddish and then translated in to Hebrew and that are filled with deep mystical secrets. The longest of these tales is &quot;The Seven Beggars&quot;, which contains many kabbalistic themes and hidden allusions. Several fragmentary stories are also included in Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan&#x27;s translation of the complete tales, &quot;Rabbi Nachman&#x27;s Stories&quot;.
*&quot;Sichot HaRan&quot; (&quot;Talks of Rabbi Nachman&quot;): Compilation of the central teachings of Rabbi Nachman, comprising 308 &quot;sichas&quot;, mainly presented as anecdotes, concerning Hassidic philosophy and the Service of God, and providing background and remarks re earlier teachings. Originally an appendix to &quot;Sippurei Ma&#x27;asiyot&quot;.

Another mysterious document that Reb Nachman dictated to Reb Nathan is the &quot;Megillat Setarim&quot; (&quot;Hidden Scroll&quot;), which was written in a cryptic combination of Hebrew initials and brief phrases. Prof. Zvi Mark has researched and attempted to decipher this document, based on disclosures from prominent members of the Breslov community. His findings have been published in Hebrew and in English translation, along with facsimiles of discrepant manuscript copies.

== Destroyed writings ==
Nachman also wrote but then destroyed &quot;Sefer HaGanuz&quot; (&quot;The Hidden Book&quot;) and the &quot;Sefer HaNisraf&quot; (&quot;The Burned Book&quot;). He told his disciples that these volumes contained deep mystical insights that few would be able to comprehend. He dictated the &quot;Sefer HaNisraf&quot; to Sternhartz, who said that he did not understand it at all and that &quot;What I do remember is that it spoke about the greatness of the mitzvah of hospitality and preparing the bed for a guest&quot;. Nachman never showed the &quot;Sefer HaGanuz&quot; to anyone, and in 1808 he burned all the copies of the &quot;Sefer HaGanuz&quot; and the &quot;Sefer Ha-nisraf&quot;.

Nachman first ordered the two manuscripts of the book &quot;Sefer HaNisraf&quot; to be destroyed in a bargain for his life during a phase of his tuberculosis which preceded his death by two years. He believed that the illness was a &quot;punishment from the upper-world--for writing a book&quot;.

Two years later, from his deathbed, he ordered a chest full of his writings to be burnt. On the evening of the last day of his life, Rabbi Nachman gave his disciples the key to a chest. &quot;As soon as I am dead,&quot; he told them, &quot;while my body is still lying here on the floor, you are to take all the writings you find in the chest and burn them. And be sure to fulfill my request.&quot;

==Quotes==
*&quot;It is a great mitzvah to be happy always.&quot;
*&quot;If you believe that you can damage, then believe that you can fix.&quot;
*&quot;Gevalt!!! Never give up hope! There is no despair.&quot;
*&quot;When a person realizes that he is on a very low level and far from God, this itself is a reason to feel encouraged. Before this, he was so far from God that he did not even know it. Now at least he knows it, and this itself is a sign that he is drawing closer.&quot;
*&quot;Worldly desires are like sunbeams in a dark room. They seem solid until you try to grasp one.&quot;
*&quot;It is very good to pour out your heart to God as you would to a true, good friend.&quot;
*&quot;You are never given an obstacle you cannot overcome.&quot;
*&quot;The essence of wisdom is to realize how far from wisdom you are.&quot;
*&quot;All the sages of Israel are in my estimation like a garlic peel.&quot;
*&quot;Wherever I go, I&#x27;m always going to Israel.&quot;
*&quot;Know that [when] a person needs to cross a very, very narrow bridge, the general principle and main point is not to make oneself at all terrified.&quot;

<doc id="306746" wikidata="Q5509445" url="?curid=306746" title="Fur-bearing trout">
<text>The fur-bearing trout (or furry trout) is a legendary creature found in American folklore and Icelandic folklore. According to folklore, the trout has created a thick coat of fur to maintain its body heat. Tales of furry fish date to the 17th-century and later the &quot;shaggy trout&quot; of Iceland. The earliest known American publication dates from a 1929 &quot;Montana Wildlife&quot; magazine article by J.H. Hicken. A taxidermy furry trout produced by Ross C. Jobe is a specimen at the Royal Museum of Scotland; it is a trout with white rabbit fur &quot;ingeniously&quot; attached.

There are no known examples of any fur-bearing trout species, but two examples of hair-like growths on fish are known. The &quot;cotton mold&quot;, &quot;Saprolegnia&quot;, can infect fish, which can result in the appearance of fish covered in the white &quot;fur&quot;. Another fish, &quot;Mirapinna esau,&quot; has hairlike outgrowth and sports wing-like pectoral fins.

== Commonalities ==
Fur-bearing trout are fictional creatures that are purportedly found in the Arkansas River, northern North America, and Iceland. The basic claim (or tall tale) is that the waters of lakes and rivers in the area are so cold that they evolved a thick coat of fur to maintain their body heat. Another theory says that it is due to four jugs – or two bottles – of hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.

The origins vary, but one of the earlier claims date to a 17th-century Scottish immigrant&#x27;s letter to his relatives referring to &quot;furried animals and fish&quot; being plentiful in the New World. It was followed by request to procure a specimen of these &quot;furried fish&quot; and one was sent home. A publication in 1900 recounts the Icelandic Lodsilungur, another haired trout, as being a common folklore. The earliest known American publication dates from a 1929 &quot;Montana Wildlife&quot; magazine article by J.H. Hicken.

The &quot;cotton mold&quot; &quot;Saprolegnia&quot; will sometimes infect fish, causing tufts of fur-like growth to appear on the body. A heavy infection will result in the fish&#x27;s death, and as the fungus continues to grow afterward, dead fish that are largely covered in the white &quot;fur&quot; can occasionally be found washed ashore. A real species of fish, &quot;Mirapinna esau,&quot; is known for the numerous hairlike structures on its body. This fish is not related to trouts but is instead a larval whalefish. It was discovered in the Azores in 1956.

== Icelandic &quot;Loðsilungur&quot; ==
According to Icelandic legend, the Lodsilungur (&quot;&quot;) is a furry trout that is the creation of demons and giants. The Lodsilungur are described as inedible fish that overwhelm rivers and are a form of punishment for human wickedness. In 1900, &quot;The Scottish Review&quot; featured an account of the Lodsilungur as a poisonous &quot;Shaggy trout&quot; of northern Iceland. In 1854, a shaggy trout was &quot;cast on shore at Svina-vatn&quot; and featured in an 1855 illustration in &quot;Nordri&quot;, a newspaper. It was described as having a reddish hair on its lower jaw and neck, sides and fins, but the writer of the &quot;Nordri&quot; article did not specifically identify it by name. Sjón, a popular Icelandic writer, became obsessed with the folk tale when he was nine. Sjón recounted that if a man were to eat the furry trout he would become pregnant and that his scrotum would have to be cut open to deliver the baby. Sjón noted that the story &quot;might explain why I was later propelled towards surrealism.&quot;

== United States furry trout ==
An account of a furry trout appeared in 1929 in &quot;Montana Wildlife&quot; magazine and was first noted by J.H. Hicken. Hicken&#x27;s account states that when the fish is caught &quot;the change of temperature from this water to atmosphere is so great that the fish explodes upon being taken from the water, and fur and skin come off in one perfect piece, making it available for commercial purposes, and leaving the body of the fish for refrigerator purposes or eating, as desired.&quot;

&quot;My Ten Years in a Quandary, and How They Grew&quot;, a 1936 bestselling book by Robert Benchley, contains the humorous essay &quot;Bad News&quot; about a report of fur-bearing trout used as a goiter cure.

Another fur-bearing trout story originated with Wilbur Foshay, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce. Foshay promoted the story so convincingly that it was picked up by the &quot;Salida Record&quot; newspaper. According to its Foshay, the trout grew fur due to the cold temperatures of the Arkansas River and shed the fur as the water temperatures warmed in the summer. In November 1938, a story in the &quot;Puebloan Cheiftan&quot; recounted the hairy trout history and stated that &quot;[o]ld-timers living along the Arkansas River near Salida have told tales for many years of the fur-bearing trout indigenous to the waters of the Arkansas near there.&quot; In 2014, &quot;Mysteries at the Museum&quot; visited the Salida Museum and is expected to be part of a segment in late 2014.

A tall tale was recounted by S.E. Schlosser, it states that hairy trout resulted from two bottles or four jugs of spilled hair tonic. To catch hairy trout, fisherman would act as barbers and lure fish from the waters with the offer of a free trim or shave. An intentionally fantastical story in Maine claimed that hairy trout were under a catch and release policy that was enforced by wardens carrying Brannock Devices. If a fish were caught, the warden would measure it against the fisher&#x27;s foot. If the fish&#x27;s length matched the fisher&#x27;s foot size, the fish could be eaten and the pelt made into furry slippers.

== Canada ==
The Canadian fur-bearing trout is another example of the furry trout hoax. According to the story, a trout with white fur was caught in Lake Superior off Gros Cap in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Algoma District, Canada, and its taxidermist was Ross C. Jobe of Sault Ste. Marie. The purchaser of the fish learned of the hoax after presenting it to the Royal Museum of Scotland. The white fur of a rabbit was described as being &quot;ingeniously&quot; attached to the fish. A fictional description of the Canadian &quot;Hairy&quot; Trout was published by Takeshi Yamada.

<text>Preston is a village and civil parish about south of Hitchin in Hertfordshire, England. At the 2011 Census the population was 420.

The village grew up around the Templar holdings at Temple Dinsley. The first church was mentioned in 1252, when six acres (24,000 m2) of land was given to nuns from Elstow, Bedfordshire. Temple Dinsley passed on to the Knights Hospitaller after the dissolution of the Templars. When the Hospitallers were in turn dissolved in 1542, the manor went to Sir Ralph Sadleir. The current house at Temple Dinsley dates from 1714, and became Princess Helena College in 1935. The college closed in 2021.

In the 17th century the village became linked with John Bunyan, who used to hold services in a natural amphitheatre now called Bunyan&#x27;s Dell.

Prior to 1894, Preston and neighbouring Langley were part of the parish of Hitchin, together forming a long salient to the south of the town itself. Preston and Langley became separate civil parishes as a result of the Local Government Act 1894, with effect from the first parish meeting on 4 December 1894. Preston civil parish was then included in the Hitchin Rural District between 1894 and 1974, when it became part of North Hertfordshire. The parish of Preston was enlarged in 1955 with the addition of territory from the neighbouring parishes of St Ippolyts and King&#x27;s Walden.

St Martin&#x27;s, the local Anglican church, opened in 1900.

The ruined Minsden Chapel, reputed to be haunted, is located near the village, though is actually in Langley civil parish.

<doc id="306749" wikidata="Q5132439" url="?curid=306749" title="Click of death">
<text>Click of death is a term that had become common in the late 1990s referring to the clicking sound in disk storage systems that signals a disk drive has failed, often catastrophically.

The clicking sound itself arises from the unexpected movement of the disk&#x27;s read/write actuator. At startup, and during use, the disk head must move correctly and be able to confirm that it is correctly tracking data on the disk. If the head fails to move as expected or upon moving cannot track the disk surface correctly, the disk controller may attempt to recover from the error by returning the head to its home position and then retrying, at times causing an audible &quot;click&quot;. In some devices, the process automatically retries, causing a repeated or rhythmic clicking sound, sometimes accompanied by the whirring sound of the drive plate spinning.

== Origin of the term ==
The phrase &quot;click of death&quot; originated to describe a failure mode of the Iomega ZIP drives, appearing in print as early as January 30, 1998. In his podcast of September 18, 2008, Mac journalist Tim Robertson claimed to have coined the phrase in the early 1990s.

== Iomega Zip drives ==

Iomega Zip drives were prone to developing misaligned heads. 
Iomega received thousands of complaints about the click of death. Iomega stated that fewer than 1 in 200 Jaz and Zip drive owners were affected by the click of death. A class-action suit (&quot;Rinaldi v. Iomega Corp.&quot;, 41 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d 1143) was filed against them for violation of the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act in September 1998.

== Hard disk drives ==


On a hard disk drive, the &quot;click of death&quot; refers to a similar failure mode; the head actuator may click or knock as the drive repetitively tries to recover from one or more errors. These sounds can be heard as the heads load or unload, or they can be the sounds of the actuator striking a stop, or both.

<doc id="306754" wikidata="Q904447" url="?curid=306754" title="Military science fiction">
<text>Military science fiction is a subgenre of science fiction and military fiction that depicts the use of science fiction technology, including spaceships and weapons, for military purposes and usually principal characters who are members of a military organization, usually during a war; occurring sometimes in outer space or on a different planet or planets. It exists in a range of media, including literature, comics, film, television and video games.

A detailed description of the conflict, belligerents (which may involve extraterrestrials), tactics and weapons used for it, and the role of a military service and the individual members of that military organization form the basis for a typical work of military science fiction. The stories often use features of actual past or current Earth conflicts, with countries being replaced by planets or galaxies with similar characteristics, battleships replaced by space battleships, small arms and artillery replaced by lasers, soldiers replaced by space marines, and certain events changed so the author can extrapolate what might have occurred.

== Characteristics ==

Traditional military values of courage under fire, sense of duty, honor, sacrifice, loyalty, and camaraderie are often emphasized. The action is typically described from the point of view of a soldier in a science fictional setting of or near battle. Typically, the technology is more advanced than that of the present and described in detail. In some stories, however, technology is fairly static, and weapons that would be familiar to present-day soldiers are used, but other aspects of society have changed. Technology may not be emphasized in such stories as much as other aspects of the characters&#x27; military lives, cultures, or societies. For example, women may be accepted as equal partners for combat roles, or preferred over men.

When the &quot;extravagan[t]&quot; depictions of war in space operas faded along with pulp fiction more generally, military science fiction developed with a &quot;more disciplined and more realistic notion of the kind of armies which might fight interplanetary and interstellar wars, and the kinds of weapons they might use&quot;.

In many stories, the usage or advancement of a specific technology plays a role in advancing the plot, such as deploying a new weapon or spaceship. Some works draw heavy parallels to human history and how a scientific breakthrough or new military doctrine can significantly change how war is fought, the outcome of a battle, and the fortunes of the combatants. Many works explore how human progress, discovery, and suffering affect military doctrine or battle, and how the protagonists and antagonists reflect on and adapt to such changes.

Many authors have either used a galaxy-spanning fictional empire as a background for the story, or have explored the growth and/or decline of such an empire. The capital of a galactic empire is sometimes a &quot;core world,&quot; such as a planet relatively near a galaxy&#x27;s centrally-located supermassive black hole, which has advanced considerably in science and technology compared to current human civilization. Characterizations of these empires can vary wildly from malevolent forces that attack sympathetic victims, to apathetic or amoral bureaucracies, to more reasonable entities focused on social progress.

A writer may posit a form of faster-than-light travel in order to facilitate the enormous scale of interstellar war. The long spans of time (e.g., decades or centuries) required for human soldiers to travel interstellar distances, even at relativistic speeds, and the consequences for the characters, is a dilemma examined by authors such as Joe Haldeman and Alastair Reynolds. Other writers such as Larry Niven have created plausible interplanetary conflict based on human colonization of the asteroid belt and outer planets by means of technologies utilizing the laws of physics as currently understood.

== Definitions by contrast ==

Several subsets of military science fiction share characteristics of the space opera subgenre, concentrating on large-scale space battles with futuristic weapons in an interstellar war. Many stories can be considered to be in one or both the military science fiction and space opera subgenres, such as &quot;The Sten Chronicles&quot; by Allan Cole and Chris Bunch, &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game series&quot; by Orson Scott Card, &quot;Honorverse&quot; by David Weber, &quot;Deathstalker&quot; by Simon R. Green, and &quot;Armor&quot; by John Steakley.

At one extreme, a military science fiction story can speculate about war in the future, in space, or involving space travel, or the effects of such a war on humans; at the other, a story with a fictional military plot may have relatively superficial science fictional elements. The term &quot;military space opera&quot; may occasionally denote this latter style, as used for example by critic Sylvia Kelso when describing Lois McMaster Bujold&#x27;s&quot; Vorkosigan Saga&quot;. Examples that feature aspects of both military science fiction and space opera include the &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; franchise and Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;.

A key distinction of military science fiction from space opera is that space operas focus more on adventurous stories and melodrama, while military science fiction focuses more on warfare and technical aspects. The principal characters in a space opera are also not military personnel, but civilians or paramilitary. Stories in both subgenres often concern an interstellar war in which humans fight themselves and/or nonhuman entities. Military science fiction, however, is not necessarily set in outer space or on multiple worlds, as in space opera and the space Western.

Both military science fiction and the space Western may consider an interstellar war and oppression by a galactic empire as the story&#x27;s backdrop. They may focus on a lone gunslinger, soldier, or veteran in a futuristic space frontier setting. Western elements and conventions in military science fiction may be explicit, such as cowboys in outer space, or more subtle, as in a space colony requiring defense against attack out on the frontier. Gene Roddenberry described &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; as a Space Western (or more poetically, as &quot;&quot;Wagon Train&quot; to the stars&quot;). The TV series &quot;Firefly&quot; and its cinematic follow-up &quot;Serenity&quot; literalized the Western aspects of the space Western subgenre as popularized by &quot;Star Trek&quot;: it features frontier towns, horses, and a visual style evocative of classic John Ford Westerns. Worlds that have been terraformed may be depicted as presenting similar challenges as that of a frontier settlement in a classic Western. Six-shooters and horses may be replaced by ray guns and rockets.

A &quot;thematic subdivision&quot; of MSF are works where &quot;ex-military protagonists [are] drawing on their battle experience for tough and violent operations in (more or less) civilian life&quot;, typically in a law enforcement setting. Some examples include Richard Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Takashi Kovacs&quot; book such as &quot;Altered Carbon&quot; (2002) and Elizabeth Bear&#x27;s Jenny Casey books, such as &quot;Hammered&quot; (2004).

== History ==
===19th century and up to early 20th century===

Precursors for military science fiction can be found in &quot;future war&quot; stories dating back at least to George Chesney&#x27;s story &quot;The Battle of Dorking&quot; (1871). Written just after the Prussian victory in the Franco-Prussian War, it describes an invasion of Britain by a German-speaking country in which the Royal Navy is destroyed by a futuristic wonder-weapon (&quot;fatal engines&quot;).

Other works of military science fiction followed, including H.G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Land Ironclads&quot;. It described tank-like &quot;land ironclads,&quot; armoured fighting vehicles that carry riflemen, engineers, and a captain, and are armed with semi-automatic rifles.
===Post-WWII era===

Eventually, as science fiction became an established and separate genre, military science fiction established itself as a subgenre. One such work is H. Beam Piper&#x27;s &quot;Uller Uprising&quot; (1952) (based on the events of the Sepoy Mutiny). Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (1959) is another work of military science fiction, along with Gordon Dickson&#x27;s &quot;Dorsai&quot; (1960), and these are thought to be mostly responsible for popularizing this subgenre&#x27;s popularity among young readers of the time.

The Vietnam War led to the &quot;polarization of the sf community&quot;, which can be seen in the June 1968 issue of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, in which one page of pro-war sf authors listed their names and on another page, anti-war sf authors put their names.
The Vietnam War has been noted by the &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; as having impacted anthologies such as &quot;In the Field of Fire&quot; (1987) and novels such as &quot;The Healer&#x27;s War&quot; (1988) by Elizabeth Ann Scarborough and &quot;Dream Baby&quot; (1989) by Bruce McAllister.
The &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; states that the Vietnam War&#x27;s influence can be seen indirectly in novels such as Joe Haldeman&#x27;s &quot;The Forever War&quot; (published in &quot;Analog&quot; over 1972–1975) and Lucius Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; (1987).
The Vietnam War resulted in veterans with combat experience deciding to write science fiction, including Joe Haldeman and David Drake. Throughout the 1970s, works such as Haldeman&#x27;s &quot;The Forever War&quot; and Drake&#x27;s &quot;Hammer&#x27;s Slammers&quot; helped increase the popularity of the genre. Short stories also were popular, collected in books such as &quot;Combat SF&quot;, edited by Gordon R. Dickson. This anthology includes one of the first Hammer&#x27;s Slammers stories, as well as one of the BOLO stories by Keith Laumer and one of the Berserker stories by Fred Saberhagen. This anthology seems to have been the first time these stories specifically dealing with war as a subject were collected and marketed as such. The series of anthologies with the group title &quot;There Will be War&quot; edited by Pournelle and John F. Carr (nine volumes from 1983 through 1990) helped keep the category active, and encouraged new writers to add to it.

David Drake wrote stories about future mercenaries, including the &quot;Hammer&#x27;s Slammers&quot; series (1979), which follows the career of a future mercenary tank regiment. Drake&#x27;s series which &quot;helped initiate a fashion for sf about mercenaries&quot;, including &quot;The Warrior&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (1986) by Lois McMaster Bujold.

A twist was introduced in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s Worldwar series depicting an alternate history in which WWII is disrupted by extraterrestrials invading Earth in 1942, forcing humans to stop fighting each other and unite against this common enemy. Turtledove depicts the tactics and strategy of this new course of the war in detail, showing how American, British, Soviet, and German soldiers and Jewish guerrillas (some of them historical figures) deal with this extraordinary new situation, as well as providing a not unsympathetic detailed point of view of individual invader warriors. In the war situation posited by Turtledove, the invaders have superior arms, but the gap is not too wide for the humans to bridge. For example, the invaders have more advanced tanks, but the German Wehrmacht&#x27;s tank crews facing them – a major theme in the series – are more skilled and far more experienced.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; lists three notable women authors of MSF: Lois McMaster Bujold; Elizabeth Moon (particularly her &quot;Familias Regnant&quot; stories such as &quot;Hunting Party&quot; (1993)), and Karen Traviss.

== Political themes==
Several authors have presented stories with political messages of varying types as major or minor themes of their works.

David Drake has often written of the horrors and futility of war. He has said, in the afterwords of several of his &quot;Hammer&#x27;s Slammers&quot; books (1979 and later), that one of his reasons for writing is to educate those people who have not experienced war, but who might have to make the decision to start or endorse a war (as policymakers or as voters) about what war is really like, and what the powers and limits of the military as an instrument of policy are.

David Weber has said:
==Practical applications by military==

In 1980 and 1981, two science fiction authors inspired President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s vision for a Strategic Defense Initiative in which satellites would be set up to shoot at nuclear missiles. The two authors were Larry Niven, the author of the Ringworld series, and Jerry Pournelle. Along with like-minded colleagues, they formed a committee to lobby the United States on space issues and influence Reagan&#x27;s space policies. Pournelle advocated a &quot;robust, technocratic military state&quot;. In addition to Pournelle&#x27;s science fiction writing, he wrote a &quot;paper for the Air Force on stability&#x27;s role in national security&quot;.

President Reagan read the space advice that Niven, Pournelle, and their colleagues prepared, which influenced Reagan&#x27;s 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative. &quot;Niven and Pournelle saw an opportunity to shape the great void in their political image, and Reagan viewed space as yet another tool to defend America against the communist superpower...&quot;. Science fiction authors such as Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov criticized the Strategic Defense Initiative.

After the 9/11 terrorism attacks, a group of sci-fi authors called Sigma, including Pournelle and Niven, advised the &quot;Department of Homeland Security on technological strategies for defeating terrorist threats.&quot;

In 2021, &quot;Worldcrunch&quot; reported that the French military has hired fiction writers to develop futuristic warfare scenarios, including situations that the military cannot directly study for &quot;ethical reasons, such as Autonomous Lethality Weapon Systems (ALWS), or augmented humans.&quot; The French military says the authors are asked to imagine warfare situations that &quot;destabilize us, scare us, blame, or even beat us&quot;, in order to provide the army with a &quot;fresh set of practice scenarios&quot;. Military planners use the science fiction authors&#x27; scenarios to &quot;prepare for previously unthought of situations&quot;, &quot;boos[t] creativity&quot; and help the military become &quot;more resourceful.&quot;

The German military is also using science fiction to help its military but in its approach, they do not hire science fiction writers to develop scenarios. Instead, they &quot;use existing science fiction&quot; to help the army &quot;predict the &quot;world&#x27;s next potential conflict.&quot;

The UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) hired two science fiction writers to pen short stories about &quot;what the wars of tomorrow will look like.&quot;
The MOD hired Peter Warren Singer and August Cole to write eight short stories about threats from &quot;emerging technologies&quot; including &quot;artificial intelligence (AI), data modeling, drone swarms, quantum computing and human enhancement&quot; in a battlefield context.
The MOD hired sci-fi writers because they have a &quot;unique ability to imagine the unimaginable.&quot; As well, both authors know about &quot;security subjects and modern warfare.&quot;
They advocate the use of Fictional Intelligence (FicInt), which they define as &quot;useful fictions&quot;. FicInt, a concept developed by Cole in 2015, combines &quot;fiction writing with intelligence to imagine future scenarios in ways grounded in reality.&quot;

<text>The Spitzer Space Telescope, formerly the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), was an infrared space telescope launched in 2003, that was deactivated when operations ended on 30 January 2020. Spitzer was the third space telescope dedicated to infrared astronomy, following IRAS (1983) and ISO (1995–1998). It was the first spacecraft to use an Earth-trailing orbit, later used by the Kepler planet-finder.

The planned mission period was to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch expectation that the mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboard liquid helium supply was exhausted. This occurred on 15 May 2009. Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments were no longer usable. However, the two shortest-wavelength modules of the IRAC camera continued to operate with the same sensitivity as before the helium was exhausted, and continued to be used into early 2020 in the Spitzer Warm Mission.

During the warm mission, the two short wavelength channels of IRAC operated at 28.7 K and were predicted to experience little to no degradation at this temperature compared to the nominal mission. The Spitzer data, from both the primary and warm phases, are archived at the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA).

In keeping with NASA tradition, the telescope was renamed after its successful demonstration of operation, on 18 December 2003. Unlike most telescopes that are named by a board of scientists, typically after famous deceased astronomers, the new name for SIRTF was obtained from a contest open to the general public.
The contest led to the telescope being named in honor of astronomer Lyman Spitzer, who had promoted the concept of space telescopes in the 1940s. Spitzer wrote a 1946 report for RAND Corporation describing the advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory and how it could be realized with available or upcoming technology. He has been cited for his pioneering contributions to rocketry and astronomy, as well as &quot;his vision and leadership in articulating the advantages and benefits to be realized from the Space Telescope Program.&quot;

The Spitzer was launched on 25 August 2003 at 05:35:39 UTC from Cape Canaveral SLC-17B aboard a Delta II 7920H rocket. It was placed into a heliocentric (as opposed to a geocentric) orbit trailing and drifting away from Earth&#x27;s orbit at approximately 0.1 astronomical units per year (an &quot;Earth-trailing&quot; orbit).

The primary mirror is in diameter, , made of beryllium and was cooled to . The satellite contains three instruments that allowed it to perform astronomical imaging and photometry from 3.6 to 160 micrometers, spectroscopy from 5.2 to 38 micrometers, and spectrophotometry from 55 to 95 micrometers.

== History ==

By the early 1970s, astronomers began to consider the possibility of placing an infrared telescope above the obscuring effects of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.
In 1979, a report from the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, &quot;A Strategy for Space Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 1980s&quot;, identified a Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) as &quot;one of two major astrophysics facilities [to be developed] for Spacelab&quot;, a shuttle-borne platform. Anticipating the major results from an upcoming Explorer satellite and from the Shuttle mission, the report also favored the &quot;study and development of ... long-duration spaceflights of infrared telescopes cooled to cryogenic temperatures.&quot;

The launch in January 1983 of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, jointly developed by the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, to conduct the first infrared survey of the sky, whetted the appetites of scientists worldwide for follow-up space missions capitalizing on the rapid improvements in infrared detector technology.

Earlier infrared observations had been made by both space-based and ground-based observatories. Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared wavelengths or frequencies, both the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and the telescope itself will radiate (glow) brightly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths. This necessitates lengthy exposure times and greatly decreases the ability to detect faint objects. It could be compared to trying to observe the stars in the optical at noon from a telescope built out of light bulbs. Previous space observatories (such as IRAS, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and ISO, the Infrared Space Observatory) were launched during the 1980s and 1990s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then.

Most of the early concepts envisioned repeated flights aboard the NASA Space Shuttle. This approach was developed in an era when the Shuttle program was expected to support weekly flights of up to 30 days duration. A May 1983 NASA proposal described SIRTF as a Shuttle-attached mission, with an evolving scientific instrument payload. Several flights were anticipated with a probable transition into a more extended mode of operation, possibly in association with a future space platform or space station. SIRTF would be a 1-meter class, cryogenically cooled, multi-user facility consisting of a telescope and associated focal plane instruments. It would be launched on the Space Shuttle and remain attached to the Shuttle as a Spacelab payload during astronomical observations, after which it would be returned to Earth for refurbishment prior to re-flight. The first flight was expected to occur about 1990, with the succeeding flights anticipated beginning approximately one year later. However, the Spacelab-2 flight aboard STS-51-F showed that the Shuttle environment was poorly suited to an onboard infrared telescope due to contamination from the relatively &quot;dirty&quot; vacuum associated with the orbiters. By September 1983, NASA was considering the &quot;possibility of a long duration [free-flyer] SIRTF mission&quot;.

Spitzer is the only one of the Great Observatories not launched by the Space Shuttle, as was originally intended. However, after the 1986 Challenger disaster, the Shuttle-Centaur upper stage, which would have been required to place it into its final orbit, was abandoned. The mission underwent a series of redesigns during the 1990s, primarily due to budget considerations. This resulted in a much smaller but still fully capable mission that could use the smaller Delta II expendable launch vehicle.
One of the most important advances of this redesign was an Earth-trailing orbit. Cryogenic satellites that require liquid helium (LHe, T ≈ 4 K) temperatures in near-Earth orbit are typically exposed to a large heat load from Earth, and consequently require large amounts of LHe coolant, which then tends to dominate the total payload mass and limits mission life. Placing the satellite in solar orbit far from Earth allowed innovative passive cooling. The sun shield protected the rest of the spacecraft from the Sun&#x27;s heat, the far side of the spacecraft was painted black to enhance passive radiation of heat, and the spacecraft bus was thermally isolated from the telescope. All of these design choices combined to drastically reduce the total mass of helium needed, resulting in an overall smaller and lighter payload, resulting in major cost savings, but with a mirror the same diameter as originally designed. This orbit also simplified telescope pointing, but did require the NASA Deep Space Network for communications.

The primary instrument package (telescope and cryogenic chamber) was developed by Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies, in Boulder, Colorado. The individual instruments were developed jointly by industrial, academic, and government institutions. The principals were Cornell University, the University of Arizona, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Ball Aerospace, and Goddard Spaceflight Center. The shorter-wavelength infrared detectors were developed by Raytheon in Goleta, California. Raytheon used indium antimonide and a doped silicon detector in the creation of the infrared detectors. These detectors are 100 times more sensitive than what was available at the beginning of the project during the 1980s. The far-infrared detectors (70–160 micrometers) were developed jointly by the University of Arizona and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using gallium-doped germanium. The spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin. The mission was operated and managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the &quot;Spitzer Science Center&quot;, located at IPAC on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, California.

===Launch and commissioning===
===Warm mission and end of mission===
Spitzer ran out of liquid helium coolant on 15 May 2009, which stopped far-IR observations. Only the IRAC instrument remained in use, and only at the two shorter wavelength bands (3.6 μm and 4.5 μm). The telescope equilibrium temperature was then around , and IRAC continued to produce valuable images at those wavelengths as the &quot;Spitzer Warm Mission&quot;.

Late in the mission, ~2016, Spitzer&#x27;s distance to Earth and the shape of its orbit meant the spacecraft had to pitch over at an extreme angle to aim its antenna at Earth. The solar panels were not fully illuminated at this angle, and this limited those communications to 2.5 hours due to the battery drain. The telescope was retired on 30 January 2020 when NASA sent a shutdown signal to the telescope from the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex (GDSCC) instructing the telescope to go into safe mode. After receiving confirmation that the command was successful, Spitzer Project Manager Joseph Hunt officially declared that the mission had ended.

== Instruments ==
Spitzer carries three instruments on board:

; Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
: An infrared camera which operated simultaneously on four wavelengths (3.6 μm, 4.5 μm, 5.8 μm and 8 μm). Each module used a 256×256-pixel detector—the short-wavelength pair used indium antimonide technology, the long-wavelength pair used arsenic-doped silicon impurity band conduction technology. The principal investigator was Giovanni Fazio of Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian; the flight hardware was built by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
; Infrared Spectrograph (IRS)
: An infrared spectrometer with four sub-modules which operate at the wavelengths 5.3–14 μm (low resolution), 10–19.5 μm (high resolution), 14–40 μm (low resolution), and 19–37 μm (high resolution). Each module used a 128×128-pixel detector—the short-wavelength pair used arsenic-doped silicon blocked impurity band technology, the long-wavelength pair used antimony-doped silicon blocked impurity band technology. The principal investigator was James R. Houck of Cornell University; the flight hardware was built by Ball Aerospace.
; Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS)
: Three detector arrays in the mid- to far-infrared (128 × 128 pixels at 24 μm, 32 × 32 pixels at 70 μm, 2 × 20 pixels at 160 μm). The 24 μm detector is identical to one of the IRS short-wavelength modules. The 70 μm detector used gallium-doped germanium technology, and the 160 μm detector also used gallium-doped germanium, but with mechanical stress added to each pixel to lower the bandgap and extend sensitivity to this long-wavelength. The principal investigator was George H. Rieke of the University of Arizona; the flight hardware was built by Ball Aerospace.

All three instruments used liquid helium for cooling the sensors. Once the helium was exhausted, only the two shorter wavelengths in IRAC were used in the &quot;warm mission&quot;.

While some time on the telescope was reserved for participating institutions and crucial projects, astronomers around the world also had the opportunity to submit proposals for observing time. Prior to launch, there was a proposal call for large, coherent investigations using Spitzer. If the telescope failed early and/or ran out of cryogen very quickly, these so-called Legacy Projects would ensure the best possible science could be obtained quickly in the early months of the mission. As a requirement tied to the funding these Legacy teams received, the teams had to deliver high-level data products back to the Spitzer Science Center (and the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive) for use by the community, again ensuring the rapid scientific return of the mission. The international scientific community quickly realized the value of delivering products for others to use, and even though Legacy projects were no longer explicitly solicited in subsequent proposal calls, teams continued to deliver products to the community. The Spitzer Science Center later reinstated named &quot;Legacy&quot; projects (and later still &quot;Exploration Science&quot; projects) in response to this community-driven effort.

Important targets included forming stars (young stellar objects, or YSOs), planets, and other galaxies. Images are freely available for educational and journalistic purposes.

The first released images from Spitzer were designed to show off the abilities of the telescope and showed a glowing stellar nursery, a big swirling, dusty galaxy, a disc of planet-forming debris, and organic material in the distant universe. Since then, many monthly press releases have highlighted Spitzer capabilities, as the NASA and ESA images do for the Hubble Space Telescope.

As one of its most noteworthy observations, in 2005, Spitzer became one of the first telescopes to directly capture light from exoplanets, namely the &quot;hot Jupiters&quot; HD 209458 b and TrES-1b, although it did not resolve that light into actual images. This was one of the first times the light from extrasolar planets had been directly detected; earlier observations had been indirectly made by drawing conclusions from behaviors of the stars the planets were orbiting. The telescope also discovered in April 2005 that Cohen-kuhi Tau/4 had a planetary disk that was vastly younger and contained less mass than previously theorized, leading to new understandings of how planets are formed.

In 2004, it was reported that Spitzer had spotted a faintly glowing body that may be the youngest star ever seen. The telescope was trained on a core of gas and dust known as L1014 which had previously appeared completely dark to ground-based observatories and to ISO (Infrared Space Observatory), a predecessor to Spitzer. The advanced technology of Spitzer revealed a bright red hot spot in the middle of L1014.

Scientists from the University of Texas at Austin, who discovered the object, believe the hot spot to be an example of early star development, with the young star collecting gas and dust from the cloud around it. Early speculation about the hot spot was that it might have been the faint light of another core that lies 10 times further from Earth but along the same line of sight as L1014. Follow-up observation from ground-based near-infrared observatories detected a faint fan-shaped glow in the same location as the object found by Spitzer. That glow is too feeble to have come from the more distant core, leading to the conclusion that the object is located within L1014. (Young &quot;et al.&quot;, 2004)

In 2005, astronomers from the University of Wisconsin at Madison and Whitewater determined, on the basis of 400 hours of observation on the Spitzer Space Telescope, that the Milky Way galaxy has a more substantial bar structure across its core than previously recognized.

Also in 2005, astronomers Alexander Kashlinsky and John Mather of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center reported that one of Spitzer earliest images may have captured the light of the first stars in the universe. An image of a quasar in the Draco constellation, intended only to help calibrate the telescope, was found to contain an infrared glow after the light of known objects was removed. Kashlinsky and Mather are convinced that the numerous blobs in this glow are the light of stars that formed as early as 100 million years after the Big Bang, redshifted by cosmic expansion.

In March 2006, astronomers reported an nebula near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, the Double Helix Nebula, which is, as the name implies, twisted into a double spiral shape. This is thought to be evidence of massive magnetic fields generated by the gas disc orbiting the supermassive black hole at the galaxy&#x27;s center, from the nebula and from Earth. This nebula was discovered by Spitzer and published in the magazine &quot;Nature&quot; on 16 March 2006.

In May 2007, astronomers successfully mapped the atmospheric temperature of HD 189733 b, thus obtaining the first map of some kind of an extrasolar planet.

Starting in September 2006, the telescope participated in a series of surveys called the Gould Belt Survey, observing the Gould&#x27;s Belt region in multiple wavelengths. The first set of observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope was completed from 21 September 2006 through 27 September. Resulting from these observations, the team of astronomers led by Dr. Robert Gutermuth, of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian reported the discovery of Serpens South, a cluster of 50 young stars in the Serpens constellation.

Scientists have long wondered how tiny silicate crystals, which need high temperatures to form, have found their way into frozen comets, born in the very cold environment of the Solar System&#x27;s outer edges. The crystals would have begun as non-crystallized, amorphous silicate particles, part of the mix of gas and dust from which the Solar System developed. This mystery has deepened with the results of the &quot;Stardust&quot; sample return mission, which captured particles from Comet Wild 2. Many of the Stardust particles were found to have formed at temperatures in excess of 1,000 K.

In May 2009, Spitzer researchers from Germany, Hungary, and the Netherlands found that amorphous silicate appears to have been transformed into crystalline form by an outburst from a star. They detected the infrared signature of forsterite silicate crystals on the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star EX Lupi during one of its frequent flare-ups, or outbursts, seen by Spitzer in April 2008. These crystals were not present in Spitzer previous observations of the star&#x27;s disk during one of its quiet periods. These crystals appear to have formed by radiative heating of the dust within 0.5 AU of EX Lupi.

In August 2009, the telescope found evidence of a high-speed collision between two burgeoning planets orbiting a young star.

In October 2009, astronomers Anne J. Verbiscer, Michael F. Skrutskie, and Douglas P. Hamilton published findings of the &quot;Phoebe ring&quot; of Saturn, which was found with the telescope; the ring is a huge, tenuous disc of material extending from 128 to 207 times the radius of Saturn.

=== GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL surveys ===
GLIMPSE, the &quot;Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire&quot;, was a series of surveys that spanned 360° of the inner region of the Milky Way galaxy, which provided the first large-scale mapping of the galaxy. It consists of more than 2 million snapshots taken in four separate wavelengths using the Infrared Array Camera. The images were taken over a 10-year period beginning in 2003 when Spitzer launched.

MIPSGAL, a similar survey that complements GLIMPSE, covers 248° of the galactic disk using the 24 and 70 μm channels of the MIPS instrument.

On 3 June 2008, scientists unveiled the largest, most detailed infrared portrait of the Milky Way, created by stitching together more than 800,000 snapshots, at the 212th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in St. Louis, Missouri. This composite survey is now viewable with the GLIMPSE/MIPSGAL Viewer.

=== 2010s ===
Spitzer observations, announced in May 2011, indicate that tiny forsterite crystals might be falling down like rain on to the protostar HOPS-68. The discovery of the forsterite crystals in the outer collapsing cloud of the protostar is surprising because the crystals form at lava-like high temperatures, yet they are found in the molecular cloud where the temperatures are about . This led the team of astronomers to speculate that the bipolar outflow from the young star may be transporting the forsterite crystals from near the star&#x27;s surface to the chilly outer cloud.

In January 2012, it was reported that further analysis of the Spitzer observations of EX Lupi can be understood if the forsterite crystalline dust was moving away from the protostar at a remarkable average speed of . It would appear that such high speeds can arise only if the dust grains had been ejected by a bipolar outflow close to the star. Such observations are consistent with an astrophysical theory, developed in the early 1990s, where it was suggested that bipolar outflows garden or transform the disks of gas and dust that surround protostars by continually ejecting reprocessed, highly heated material from the inner disk, adjacent to the protostar, to regions of the accretion disk further away from the protostar.

In April 2015, Spitzer and the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment were reported as co-discovering one of the most distant planets ever identified: a gas giant about away from Earth.
In June and July 2015, the brown dwarf was discovered using the gravitational microlensing detection method in a joint effort between Swift, Spitzer, and the ground-based Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, the first time two space telescopes have observed the same microlensing event. This method was possible because of the large separation between the two spacecraft: Swift is in low-Earth orbit while Spitzer is more than one AU distant in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit. This separation provided significantly different perspectives of the brown dwarf, allowing for constraints to be placed on some of the object&#x27;s physical characteristics.

Reported in March 2016, Spitzer and Hubble were used to discover the most distant-known galaxy, GN-z11. This object was seen as it appeared 13.4 billion years ago.

=== &quot;Spitzer Beyond&quot; ===
On 1 October 2016, Spitzer began its Observation Cycle 13, a year extended mission nicknamed &quot;Beyond&quot;. One of the goals of this extended mission was to help prepare for the James Webb Space Telescope, also an infrared telescope, by identifying candidates for more detailed observations.

Another aspect of the &quot;Beyond&quot; mission was the engineering challenges of operating Spitzer in its progressing orbital phase. As the spacecraft moved farther from Earth on the same orbital path from the Sun, its antenna had to point at increasingly higher angles to communicate with ground stations; this change in angle imparted more and more solar heating on the vehicle while its solar panels received less sunlight.

=== Planet hunter ===
Spitzer was also put to work studying exoplanets thanks to creatively tweaking its hardware. This included doubling its stability by modifying its heating cycle, finding a new use for the &quot;peak-up&quot; camera, and analyzing the sensor at a sub-pixel level. Although in its &quot;warm&quot; mission, the spacecraft&#x27;s passive cooling system kept the sensors at . Spitzer used the transit photometry and gravitational microlensing techniques to perform these observations. According to NASA&#x27;s Sean Carey, &quot;We never even considered using Spitzer for studying exoplanets when it launched. ... It would have seemed ludicrous back then, but now it&#x27;s an important part of what Spitzer does.&quot;

Examples of exoplanets discovered using Spitzer include HD 219134 b in 2015, which was shown to be a rocky planet about 1.5 times as large as Earth in a three-day orbit around its star; and an unnamed planet found using microlensing located about from Earth.

In September–October 2016, Spitzer was used to discover five of a total of seven known planets around the star TRAPPIST-1, all of which are approximately Earth-sized and likely rocky. Three of the discovered planets are located in the habitable zone, which means they are capable of supporting liquid water given sufficient parameters. Using the transit method, Spitzer helped measure the sizes of the seven planets and estimate the mass and density of the inner six. Further observations will help determine if there is liquid water on any of the planets.

<text>Gary Kleck (born March 2, 1951) is a criminologist and the David J. Bordua Professor Emeritus of Criminology at Florida State University.

==Early life and education==

Kleck was born in Lombard, Illinois, to William and Joyce Kleck. He attended Glenbard East High School before enrolling in the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he received his BA (1973), MA (1975), and PhD (1979), all in Sociology.

==Criminology==

Kleck has done numerous studies of the effects of guns on death and injury in crimes, on suicides, and gun accidents, the impact of gun control laws on rates of violence, the frequency and effectiveness of defensive gun use by crime victims, patterns of gun ownership, why people support gun control, and &quot;the myth of big-time gun trafficking.&quot;

In addition to his work on guns and violence, Kleck has done research concluding that increasing levels of punishment will not increase the deterrent effects of punishment, and that capital punishment does not have any measurable effect on homicide rates.

===Defensive gun use research and debate===
Kleck conducted a national survey in 1994 (the National Self-Defense Survey) and, extrapolating from the 5,000 households surveyed, estimated that in 1993 there were approximately 2.5 million incidents of defensive gun use (DGU – the use of guns for self-protection), compared to about 0.5 million gun crimes as estimated by the National Crime Victimization Survey.

David Hemenway at the Harvard School of Public Health Injury Control Research Center, said that Kleck&#x27;s estimates are difficult to reconcile with comparable crime statistics, are subject to a high degree of sampling error, and that &quot;because of differences in coverage and potential response errors, what exactly these surveys measure remains uncertain; mere repetition does not eliminate bias.&quot; Kleck and Gertz responded to this criticism saying: &quot;It is obvious to us that David Hemenway had no intention of producing a balanced, intellectually serious assessment of our estimates of defensive gun use (DGU). Instead, his critique serves the narrow political purpose of &#x27;getting the estimate down,&#x27; for the sake of advancing the gun control cause.&quot;

Kleck asserts errors in his critics&#x27; claims that his survey&#x27;s estimates of defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved a wounding of the offender, are implausibly large compared to estimates of the total numbers of such crimes. The total number of nonfatal gunshot woundings, whether medically treated or not, is unknown, and no meaningful estimates can be derived from his survey regarding defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved wounding the offender, because the sample sizes are too small. The fact that some crime-specific estimates derived from the Kleck survey are implausibly large is at least partly a reflection of the small samples on which they are based - no more than 196 cases. Kleck states that his estimate of total defensive gun uses was based on nearly 5,000 cases. Thus, he argues, the implausible character of some estimates of small &quot;subsets&quot; of defensive gun uses is not a valid criticism of whether estimates of the &quot;total&quot; number of defensive gun uses are implausible or too high.

Marvin Wolfgang, who was acknowledged in 1994 by the British Journal of Criminology as ″the most influential criminologist in the English-speaking world″, commented on Kleck&#x27;s research concerning defensive gun use:
A 1997 National Institute of Justice publication claimed that it is virtually impossible to reconcile Kleck&#x27;s estimates and Kleck-like estimates to the amount of crime that actually occurs in the United States. Kleck, however, counter-argued that this conclusion was the product of logical errors and a mistake by the authors in which they made an inappropriate apples and oranges comparison. A study by Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig published in 1997 performed the same survey with a correction for false positives and obtained estimates within the margin of sampling error of the Kleck &amp; Gertz estimates, and that were far larger than estimates derived from the NCVS. The NCVS, however, never specifically asks respondents about defensive gun use, and its estimates have never been confirmed by any other survey. In contrast, at least 21 consecutive professionally conducted national surveys have yielded estimates in 1–3 million range, many times higher than those derived from the NCVS. 

==Impact==

In 1993, Kleck won the Michael J. Hindelang Award from the American Society of Criminology for his book &quot;Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America&quot; (Aldine de Gruyter, 1991). He has testified before Congress and state legislatures on gun control proposals. His research was cited in the Supreme Court&#x27;s landmark &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot; decision, which struck down the D.C. handgun ban and held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms.

<text>Neriah ( &quot;Nērīyyā&quot;, &quot;My lamp is Jah&quot;) is the son of Mahseiah, and the father of Baruch and Seraiah ben Neriah. He is mentioned in the Book of Jeremiah (32:12 and 51:59) of the Hebrew Bible.

==Talmud==
The Talmud lists him and his sons as prophets.

==Historicity==
In 1975, a clay &quot;bulla&quot; purportedly containing Baruch&#x27;s seal and name appeared on the antiquities market. Its purchaser, a prominent Israeli collector, permitted the Israeli archaeologist Nahman Avigad to publish the bulla. Although its source is not definitively known, it has been identified as coming from the &quot;burnt house&quot; excavated by Yigal Shiloh. The &quot;bulla&quot; is now in the Israel Museum. It measures 17 by 16 mm and is stamped with an oval seal, 13 by 11 mm. The inscription, written in the ancient Hebrew alphabet, reads:

In 1996, a second clay &quot;bulla&quot; emerged with an identical inscription, presumably stamped with the same seal. This &quot;bulla&quot; was also imprinted with a fingerprint; Hershel Shanks, among others, speculated that the fingerprint might be that of Baruch himself. The authenticity of these &quot;bullae&quot;, however, has been disputed.&quot;ibid.&quot;

Another &quot;bulla&quot; was found with the name of &quot;Seraiahu, son of Neriyahu&quot;, believed to belong to Seraiah ben Neriah.

<doc id="306766" wikidata="Q905302" url="?curid=306766" title="GROMACS">
<text>GROMACS is a molecular dynamics package mainly designed for simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. It was originally developed in the Biophysical Chemistry department of University of Groningen, and is now maintained by contributors in universities and research centers worldwide. GROMACS is one of the fastest and most popular software packages available, and can run on central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). It is free, open-source software released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) (GPL prior to Version 4.6).

==History==
The GROMACS project originally began in 1991 at Department of Biophysical Chemistry, University of Groningen, Netherlands (1991–2000). Its name originally derived from this time (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations) although currently GROMACS is not an abbreviation for anything, as little active development has taken place in Groningen in recent decades. The original goal was to construct a dedicated parallel computer system for molecular simulations, based on a ring architecture (since superseded by modern hardware designs). The molecular dynamics specific routines were rewritten in the programming language C from the Fortran 77-based program GROMOS, which had been developed in the same group.

Since 2001, GROMACS is developed by the GROMACS development teams at the Royal Institute of Technology and Uppsala University, Sweden.

==Features==
GROMACS is operated via the command-line interface, and can use files for input and output. It provides calculation progress and estimated time of arrival (ETA) feedback, a trajectory viewer, and an extensive library for trajectory analysis. In addition, support for different force fields makes GROMACS very flexible. It can be executed in parallel, using Message Passing Interface (MPI) or threads. It contains a script to convert molecular coordinates from Protein Data Bank (PDB) files into the formats it uses internally. Once a configuration file for the simulation of several molecules (possibly including solvent) has been created, the simulation run (which can be time-consuming) produces a trajectory file, describing the movements of the atoms over time. That file can then be analyzed or visualized with several supplied tools.

GROMACS has had GPU offload support since Version 4.5, originally limited to Nvidia GPUs. GPU support has been expanded and improved over the years, and, in Version 2023, GROMACS has CUDA, OpenCL, and SYCL backends for running on GPUs of AMD, Apple, Intel, and Nvidia, often with great acceleration compared to CPU. 

===Easter eggs===
, GROMACS&#x27; source code contains approximately 400 alternative backronyms to &quot;GROMACS&quot; as jokes among the developers and biochemistry researchers. These include &quot;&quot;Gromacs Runs On Most of All Computer Systems&quot;, &quot;Gromacs Runs One Microsecond At Cannonball Speeds&quot;, &quot;Good ROcking Metal Altar for Chronical Sinner&quot;, &quot;Working on GRowing Old MAkes el Chrono Sweat&quot;, and &quot;Great Red Owns Many ACres of Sand&quot;. They are randomly selected to possibly appear in GROMACS&#x27;s output stream. In one instance, such an bacronym, &quot;Giving Russians Opium May Alter Current Situation&quot;&quot;, caused offense.

==Applications==
Under a non-GPL license, GROMACS is widely used in the Folding@home distributed computing project for simulations of protein folding, where it is the base code for the project&#x27;s largest and most regularly used series of calculation cores. EvoGrid, a distributed computing project to evolve artificial life, also employs GROMACS.

<text>Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD, formerly Not Another Molecular Dynamics Program) is computer software for molecular dynamics simulation, written using the Charm++ parallel programming model (not to be confused with CHARMM). It is noted for its parallel efficiency and is often used to simulate large systems (millions of atoms). It has been developed by the collaboration of the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group (TCB) and the Parallel Programming Laboratory (PPL) at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign.

It was introduced in 1995 by Nelson &quot;et al.&quot; as a parallel molecular dynamics code enabling interactive simulation by linking to the visualization code VMD. NAMD has since matured, adding many features and scaling beyond 500,000 processor cores.

NAMD has an interface to quantum chemistry packages ORCA and MOPAC, as well as a scripted interface to many other quantum packages. Together with Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) and QwikMD, NAMD&#x27;s interface provides access to hybrid QM/MM simulations in an integrated, comprehensive, customizable, and easy-to-use suite.

NAMD is available as freeware for non-commercial use by individuals, academic institutions, and corporations for in-house business uses.

<text>Protein structure prediction is the inference of the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence—that is, the prediction of its secondary and tertiary structure from primary structure. Structure prediction is different from the inverse problem of protein design. 

Protein structure prediction is one of the most important goals pursued by computational biology and addresses Levinthal&#x27;s paradox. Accurate structure prediction has important applications in medicine (for example, in drug design) and biotechnology (for example, in novel enzyme design).

Starting in 1994, the performance of current methods is assessed biannually in the &quot;Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction&quot; (CASP) experiment. A continuous evaluation of protein structure prediction web servers is performed by the community project &quot;Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn&quot; (CAMEO3D).

==Protein structure and terminology==
Proteins are chains of amino acids joined together by peptide bonds. Many conformations of this chain are possible due to the rotation of the main chain about the two torsion angles φ and ψ at the Cα atom (see figure). This conformational flexibility is responsible for differences in the three-dimensional structure of proteins. The peptide bonds in the chain are polar, i.e. they have separated positive and negative charges (partial charges) in the carbonyl group, which can act as hydrogen bond acceptor and in the NH group, which can act as hydrogen bond donor. These groups can therefore interact in the protein structure. Proteins consist mostly of 20 different types of L-α-amino acids (the proteinogenic amino acids). These can be classified according to the chemistry of the side chain, which also plays an important structural role. Glycine takes on a special position, as it has the smallest side chain, only one hydrogen atom, and therefore can increase the local flexibility in the protein structure. Cysteine in contrast can react with another cysteine residue to form one cystine and thereby form a cross link stabilizing the whole structure.

The protein structure can be considered as a sequence of secondary structure elements, such as α helices and β sheets. In these secondary structures, regular patterns of H-bonds are formed between the main chain NH and CO groups of spatially neighboring amino acids, and the amino acids have similar Φ and ψ
angles.
The formation of these secondary structures efficiently satisfies the hydrogen bonding capacities of the peptide bonds. The secondary structures can be tightly packed in the protein core in a hydrophobic environment, but they can also present at the polar protein surface. Each amino acid side chain has a limited volume to occupy and a limited number of possible interactions with other nearby side chains, a situation that must be taken into account in molecular modeling and alignments.

===α-helix===
The α-helix is the most abundant type of secondary structure in proteins. The α-helix has 3.6 amino acids per turn with an H-bond formed between every fourth residue; the average length is 10 amino acids (3 turns) or 10 Å but varies from 5 to 40 (1.5 to 11 turns). The alignment of the H-bonds creates a dipole moment for the helix with a resulting partial positive charge at the amino end of the helix. Because this region has free NH groups, it will interact with negatively charged groups such as phosphates. The most common location of α-helices is at the surface of protein cores, where they provide an interface with the aqueous environment. The inner-facing side of the helix tends to have hydrophobic amino acids and the outer-facing side hydrophilic amino acids. Thus, every third of four amino acids along the chain will tend to be hydrophobic, a pattern that can be quite readily detected. In the leucine zipper motif, a repeating pattern of leucines on the facing sides of two adjacent helices is highly predictive of the motif. A helical-wheel plot can be used to show this repeated pattern. Other α-helices buried in the protein core or in cellular membranes have a higher and more regular distribution of hydrophobic amino acids, and are highly predictive of such structures. Helices exposed on the surface have a lower proportion of hydrophobic amino acids. Amino acid content can be predictive of an α-helical region. Regions richer in alanine (A), glutamic acid (E), leucine (L), and methionine (M) and poorer in proline (P), glycine (G), tyrosine (Y), and serine (S) tend to form an α-helix. Proline destabilizes or breaks an α-helix but can be present in longer helices, forming a bend.

===β-sheet===

β-sheets are formed by H-bonds between an average of 5–10 consecutive amino acids in one portion of the chain with another 5–10 farther down the chain. The interacting regions may be adjacent, with a short loop in between, or far apart, with other structures in between. Every chain may run in the same direction to form a parallel sheet, every other chain may run in the reverse chemical direction to form an anti parallel sheet, or the chains may be parallel and anti parallel to form a mixed sheet. The pattern of H bonding is different in the parallel and anti parallel configurations. Each amino acid in the interior strands of the sheet forms two H-bonds with neighboring amino acids, whereas each amino acid on the outside strands forms only one bond with an interior strand. Looking across the sheet at right angles to the strands, more distant strands are rotated slightly counterclockwise to form a left-handed twist. The Cα-atoms alternate above and below the sheet in a pleated structure, and the R side groups of the amino acids alternate above and below the pleats. The Φ and Ψ angles of the amino acids in sheets vary considerably in one region of the Ramachandran plot. It is more difficult to predict the location of β-sheets than of α-helices. The situation improves somewhat when the amino acid variation in multiple sequence alignments is taken into account.

===Deltas===
Some parts of the protein have fixed three-dimensional structure, but do not form any regular structures. They should not be confused with disordered or unfolded segments of proteins or random coil, an unfolded polypeptide chain lacking any fixed three-dimensional structure. These parts are frequently called &quot;deltas&quot; (&quot;Δ&quot;) because they connect β-sheets and α-helices. Deltas are usually located at protein surface, and therefore mutations of their residues are more easily tolerated. Having more substitutions, insertions, and deletions in a certain region of a sequence alignment maybe an indication of some delta. The positions of introns in genomic DNA may correlate with the locations of loops in the encoded protein . Deltas also tend to have charged and polar amino acids and are frequently a component of active sites.

==Protein classification==

Proteins may be classified according to both structural and sequential similarity. For structural classification, the sizes and spatial arrangements of secondary structures described in the above paragraph are compared in known three-dimensional structures. Classification based on sequence similarity was historically the first to be used. Initially, similarity based on alignments of whole sequences was performed. Later, proteins were classified on the basis of the occurrence of conserved amino acid patterns. Databases that classify proteins by one or more of these schemes are available.
In considering protein classification schemes, it is important to keep several observations in mind. First, two entirely different protein sequences from different evolutionary origins may fold into a similar structure. Conversely, the sequence of an ancient gene for a given structure may have diverged considerably in different species while at the same time maintaining the same basic structural features. Recognizing any remaining sequence similarity in such cases may be a very difficult task. Second, two proteins that share a significant degree of sequence similarity either with each other or with a third sequence also share an evolutionary origin and should share some structural features also. However, gene duplication and genetic rearrangements during evolution may give rise to new gene copies, which can then evolve into proteins with new function and structure.

===Terms used for classifying protein structures and sequences===
The more commonly used terms for evolutionary and structural relationships among proteins are listed below. Many additional terms are used for various kinds of structural features found in proteins. Descriptions of such terms may be found at the CATH Web site, the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) Web site, and a Glaxo Wellcome tutorial on the Swiss bioinformatics Expasy Web site.

;Active site: a localized combination of amino acid side groups within the tertiary (three-dimensional) or quaternary (protein subunit) structure that can interact with a chemically specific substrate and that provides the protein with biological activity. Proteins of very different amino acid sequences may fold into a structure that produces the same active site.
;Architecture: is the relative orientations of secondary structures in a three-dimensional structure without regard to whether or not they share a similar loop structure.
;Fold (topology): a type of architecture that also has a conserved loop structure.
;Blocks: is a conserved amino acid sequence pattern in a family of proteins. The pattern includes a series of possible matches at each position in the represented sequences, but there are not any inserted or deleted positions in the pattern or in the sequences. By way of contrast, sequence profiles are a type of scoring matrix that represents a similar set of patterns that includes insertions and deletions.
;Class: a term used to classify protein domains according to their secondary structural content and organization. Four classes were originally recognized by Levitt and Chothia (1976), and several others have been added in the SCOP database. Three classes are given in the CATH database: mainly-α, mainly-β, and α–β, with the α–β class including both alternating α/β and α+β structures.
;Core: the portion of a folded protein molecule that comprises the hydrophobic interior of α-helices and β-sheets. The compact structure brings together side groups of amino acids into close enough proximity so that they can interact. When comparing protein structures, as in the SCOP database, core is the region common to most of the structures that share a common fold or that are in the same superfamily. In structure prediction, core is sometimes defined as the arrangement of secondary structures that is likely to be conserved during evolutionary change.
;Domain (sequence context): a segment of a polypeptide chain that can fold into a three-dimensional structure irrespective of the presence of other segments of the chain. The separate domains of a given protein may interact extensively or may be joined only by a length of polypeptide chain. A protein with several domains may use these domains for functional interactions with different molecules.
;Family (sequence context): a group of proteins of similar biochemical function that are more than 50% identical when aligned. This same cutoff is still used by the Protein Information Resource (PIR). A protein family comprises proteins with the same function in different organisms (orthologous sequences) but may also include proteins in the same organism (paralogous sequences) derived from gene duplication and rearrangements. If a multiple sequence alignment of a protein family reveals a common level of similarity throughout the lengths of the proteins, PIR refers to the family as a homeomorphic family. The aligned region is referred to as a homeomorphic domain, and this region may comprise several smaller homology domains that are shared with other families. Families may be further subdivided into subfamilies or grouped into superfamilies based on respective higher or lower levels of sequence similarity. The SCOP database reports 1296 families and the CATH database (version 1.7 beta), reports 1846 families.
:When the sequences of proteins with the same function are examined in greater detail, some are found to share high sequence similarity. They are obviously members of the same family by the above criteria. However, others are found that have very little, or even insignificant, sequence similarity with other family members. In such cases, the family relationship between two distant family members A and C can often be demonstrated by finding an additional family member B that shares significant similarity with both A and C. Thus, B provides a connecting link between A and C. Another approach is to examine distant alignments for highly conserved matches.
:At a level of identity of 50%, proteins are likely to have the same three-dimensional structure, and the identical atoms in the sequence alignment will also superimpose within approximately 1 Å in the structural model. Thus, if the structure of one member of a family is known, a reliable prediction may be made for a second member of the family, and the higher the identity level, the more reliable the prediction. Protein structural modeling can be performed by examining how well the amino acid substitutions fit into the core of the three-dimensional structure.
;Family (structural context): as used in the FSSP database (Families of structurally similar proteins) and the DALI/FSSP Web site, two structures that have a significant level of structural similarity but not necessarily significant sequence similarity.
;Fold: similar to structural motif, includes a larger combination of secondary structural units in the same configuration. Thus, proteins sharing the same fold have the same combination of secondary structures that are connected by similar loops. An example is the Rossman fold comprising several alternating α helices and parallel β strands. In the SCOP, CATH, and FSSP databases, the known protein structures have been classified into hierarchical levels of structural complexity with the fold as a basic level of classification.
;Homologous domain (sequence context): an extended sequence pattern, generally found by sequence alignment methods, that indicates a common evolutionary origin among the aligned sequences. A homology domain is generally longer than motifs. The domain may include all of a given protein sequence or only a portion of the sequence. Some domains are complex and made up of several smaller homology domains that became joined to form a larger one during evolution. A domain that covers an entire sequence is called the homeomorphic domain by PIR (Protein Information Resource).
;Module: a region of conserved amino acid patterns comprising one or more motifs and considered to be a fundamental unit of structure or function. The presence of a module has also been used to classify proteins into families.
;Motif (sequence context): a conserved pattern of amino acids that is found in two or more proteins. In the Prosite catalog, a motif is an amino acid pattern that is found in a group of proteins that have a similar biochemical activity, and that often is near the active site of the protein. Examples of sequence motif databases are the Prosite catalog and the Stanford Motifs Database.
;Motif (structural context): a combination of several secondary structural elements produced by the folding of adjacent sections of the polypeptide chain into a specific three-dimensional configuration. An example is the helix-loop-helix motif. Structural motifs are also referred to as supersecondary structures and folds.
;Position-specific scoring matrix (sequence context, also known as weight or scoring matrix): represents a conserved region in a multiple sequence alignment with no gaps. Each matrix column represents the variation found in one column of the multiple sequence alignment.
;Position-specific scoring matrix—3D (structural context): represents the amino acid variation found in an alignment of proteins that fall into the same structural class. Matrix columns represent the amino acid variation found at one amino acid position in the aligned structures.
;Primary structure: the linear amino acid sequence of a protein, which chemically is a polypeptide chain composed of amino acids joined by peptide bonds.
;Profile (sequence context): a scoring matrix that represents a multiple sequence alignment of a protein family. The profile is usually obtained from a well-conserved region in a multiple sequence alignment. The profile is in the form of a matrix with each column representing a position in the alignment and each row one of the amino acids. Matrix values give the likelihood of each amino acid at the corresponding position in the alignment. The profile is moved along the target sequence to locate the best scoring regions by a dynamic programming algorithm. Gaps are allowed during matching and a gap penalty is included in this case as a negative score when no amino acid is matched. A sequence profile may also be represented by a hidden Markov model, referred to as a profile HMM.
;Profile (structural context): a scoring matrix that represents which amino acids should fit well and which should fit poorly at sequential positions in a known protein structure. Profile columns represent sequential positions in the structure, and profile rows represent the 20 amino acids. As with a sequence profile, the structural profile is moved along a target sequence to find the highest possible alignment score by a dynamic programming algorithm. Gaps may be included and receive a penalty. The resulting score provides an indication as to whether or not the target protein might adopt such a structure.
;Quaternary structure: the three-dimensional configuration of a protein molecule comprising several independent polypeptide chains.
;Secondary structure: the interactions that occur between the C, O, and NH groups on amino acids in a polypeptide chain to form α-helices, β-sheets, turns, loops, and other forms, and that facilitate the folding into a three-dimensional structure.
;Superfamily: a group of protein families of the same or different lengths that are related by distant yet detectable sequence similarity. Members of a given superfamily thus have a common evolutionary origin. Originally, Dayhoff defined the cutoff for superfamily status as being the chance that the sequences are not related of 10 6, on the basis of an alignment score (Dayhoff et al. 1978). Proteins with few identities in an alignment of the sequences but with a convincingly common number of structural and functional features are placed in the same superfamily. At the level of three-dimensional structure, superfamily proteins will share common structural features such as a common fold, but there may also be differences in the number and arrangement of secondary structures. The PIR resource uses the term &quot;homeomorphic superfamilies&quot; to refer to superfamilies that are composed of sequences that can be aligned from end to end, representing a sharing of single sequence homology domain, a region of similarity that extends throughout the alignment. This domain may also comprise smaller homology domains that are shared with other protein families and superfamilies. Although a given protein sequence may contain domains found in several superfamilies, thus indicating a complex evolutionary history, sequences will be assigned to only one homeomorphic superfamily based on the presence of similarity throughout a multiple sequence alignment. The superfamily alignment may also include regions that do not align either within or at the ends of the alignment. In contrast, sequences in the same family align well throughout the alignment.
;Supersecondary structure: a term with similar meaning to a structural motif. Tertiary structure is the three-dimensional or globular structure formed by the packing together or folding of secondary structures of a polypeptide chain.

==Secondary structure==
Secondary structure prediction is a set of techniques in bioinformatics that aim to predict the local secondary structures of proteins based only on knowledge of their amino acid sequence. For proteins, a prediction consists of assigning regions of the amino acid sequence as likely alpha helices, beta strands (often termed &quot;extended&quot; conformations), or turns. The success of a prediction is determined by comparing it to the results of the DSSP algorithm (or similar e.g. STRIDE) applied to the crystal structure of the protein. Specialized algorithms have been developed for the detection of specific well-defined patterns such as transmembrane helices and coiled coils in proteins.

The best modern methods of secondary structure prediction in proteins were claimed to reach 80% accuracy after using machine learning and sequence alignments; this high accuracy allows the use of the predictions as feature improving fold recognition and ab initio protein structure prediction, classification of structural motifs, and refinement of sequence alignments. The accuracy of current protein secondary structure prediction methods is assessed in weekly benchmarks such as LiveBench and EVA.

===Background===
Early methods of secondary structure prediction, introduced in the 1960s and early 1970s, focused on identifying likely alpha helices and were based mainly on helix-coil transition models. Significantly more accurate predictions that included beta sheets were introduced in the 1970s and relied on statistical assessments based on probability parameters derived from known solved structures. These methods, applied to a single sequence, are typically at most about 60–65% accurate, and often underpredict beta sheets. Since the 1980s, artificial neural networks have been applied to the prediction of protein structures.
The evolutionary conservation of secondary structures can be exploited by simultaneously assessing many homologous sequences in a multiple sequence alignment, by calculating the net secondary structure propensity of an aligned column of amino acids. In concert with larger databases of known protein structures and modern machine learning methods such as neural nets and support vector machines, these methods can achieve up to 80% overall accuracy in globular proteins. The theoretical upper limit of accuracy is around 90%, partly due to idiosyncrasies in DSSP assignment near the ends of secondary structures, where local conformations vary under native conditions but may be forced to assume a single conformation in crystals due to packing constraints. Moreover, the typical secondary structure prediction methods do not account for the influence of tertiary structure on formation of secondary structure; for example, a sequence predicted as a likely helix may still be able to adopt a beta-strand conformation if it is located within a beta-sheet region of the protein and its side chains pack well with their neighbors. Dramatic conformational changes related to the protein&#x27;s function or environment can also alter local secondary structure.

===Historical perspective===
To date, over 20 different secondary structure prediction methods have been developed. One of the first algorithms was Chou–Fasman method, which relies predominantly on probability parameters determined from relative frequencies of each amino acid&#x27;s appearance in each type of secondary structure. The original Chou-Fasman parameters, determined from the small sample of structures solved in the mid-1970s, produce poor results compared to modern methods, though the parameterization has been updated since it was first published. The Chou-Fasman method is roughly 50–60% accurate in predicting secondary structures.

The next notable program was the GOR method is an information theory-based method. It uses the more powerful probabilistic technique of Bayesian inference. The GOR method takes into account not only the probability of each amino acid having a particular secondary structure, but also the conditional probability of the amino acid assuming each structure given the contributions of its neighbors (it does not assume that the neighbors have that same structure). The approach is both more sensitive and more accurate than that of Chou and Fasman because amino acid structural propensities are only strong for a small number of amino acids such as proline and glycine. Weak contributions from each of many neighbors can add up to strong effects overall. The original GOR method was roughly 65% accurate and is dramatically more successful in predicting alpha helices than beta sheets, which it frequently mispredicted as loops or disorganized regions.

Another big step forward, was using machine learning methods. First artificial neural networks methods were used. As a training sets they use solved structures to identify common sequence motifs associated with particular arrangements of secondary structures. These methods are over 70% accurate in their predictions, although beta strands are still often underpredicted due to the lack of three-dimensional structural information that would allow assessment of hydrogen bonding patterns that can promote formation of the extended conformation required for the presence of a complete beta sheet. PSIPRED and JPRED are some of the most known programs based on neural networks for protein secondary structure prediction. Next, support vector machines have proven particularly useful for predicting the locations of turns, which are difficult to identify with statistical methods.

Extensions of machine learning techniques attempt to predict more fine-grained local properties of proteins, such as backbone dihedral angles in unassigned regions. Both SVMs and neural networks have been applied to this problem. More recently, real-value torsion angles can be accurately predicted by SPINE-X and successfully employed for ab initio structure prediction.

===Other improvements===
It is reported that in addition to the protein sequence, secondary structure formation depends on other factors. For example, it is reported that secondary structure tendencies depend also on local environment, solvent accessibility of residues, protein structural class, and even the organism from which the proteins are obtained. Based on such observations, some studies have shown that secondary structure prediction can be improved by addition of information about protein structural class, residue accessible surface area and also contact number information.

==Tertiary structure==

The practical role of protein structure prediction is now more important than ever. Massive amounts of protein sequence data are produced by modern large-scale DNA sequencing efforts such as the Human Genome Project. Despite community-wide efforts in structural genomics, the output of experimentally determined protein structures—typically by time-consuming and relatively expensive X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy—is lagging far behind the output of protein sequences.

The protein structure prediction remains an extremely difficult and unresolved undertaking. The two main problems are the calculation of protein free energy and finding the global minimum of this energy. A protein structure prediction method must explore the space of possible protein structures which is astronomically large. These problems can be partially bypassed in &quot;comparative&quot; or homology modeling and fold recognition methods, in which the search space is pruned by the assumption that the protein in question adopts a structure that is close to the experimentally determined structure of another homologous protein. In contrast, the de novo protein structure prediction methods must explicitly resolve these problems. The progress and challenges in protein structure prediction have been reviewed by Zhang.

===Before modelling===
Most tertiary structure modelling methods, such as Rosetta, are optimized for modelling the tertiary structure of single protein domains. A step called domain parsing, or domain boundary prediction, is usually done first to split a protein into potential structural domains. As with the rest of tertiary structure prediction, this can be done comparatively from known structures or &quot;ab initio&quot; with the sequence only (usually by machine learning, assisted by covariation). The structures for individual domains are docked together in a process called domain assembly to form the final tertiary structure.

===&quot;Ab initio&quot; protein modelling===
====Energy- and fragment-based methods====
&quot;Ab initio&quot;- or &quot;de novo&quot;- protein modelling methods seek to build three-dimensional protein models &quot;from scratch&quot;, i.e., based on physical principles rather than (directly) on previously solved structures. There are many possible procedures that either attempt to mimic protein folding or apply some stochastic method to search possible solutions (i.e., global optimization of a suitable energy function). These procedures tend to require vast computational resources, and have thus only been carried out for tiny proteins. To predict protein structure &quot;de novo&quot; for larger proteins will require better algorithms and larger computational resources like those afforded by either powerful supercomputers (such as Blue Gene or MDGRAPE-3) or distributed computing (such as Folding@home, the Human Proteome Folding Project and Rosetta@Home). Although these computational barriers are vast, the potential benefits of structural genomics (by predicted or experimental methods) make &quot;ab initio&quot; structure prediction an active research field.

As of 2009, a 50-residue protein could be simulated atom-by-atom on a supercomputer for 1 millisecond. As of 2012, comparable stable-state sampling could be done on a standard desktop with a new graphics card and more sophisticated algorithms. A much larger simulation timescales can be achieved using coarse-grained modeling.

====Evolutionary covariation to predict 3D contacts====
As sequencing became more commonplace in the 1990s several groups used protein sequence alignments to predict correlated mutations and it was hoped that these coevolved residues could be used to predict tertiary structure (using the analogy to distance constraints from experimental procedures such as NMR). The assumption is when single residue mutations are slightly deleterious, compensatory mutations may occur to restabilize residue-residue interactions.
This early work used what are known as &quot;local&quot; methods to calculate correlated mutations from protein sequences, but suffered from indirect false correlations which result from treating each pair of residues as independent of all other pairs.

In 2011, a different, and this time &quot;global&quot; statistical approach, demonstrated that predicted coevolved residues were sufficient to predict the 3D fold of a protein, providing there are enough sequences available (&gt;1,000 homologous sequences are needed). The method, EVfold, uses no homology modeling, threading or 3D structure fragments and can be run on a standard personal computer even for proteins with hundreds of residues. The accuracy of the contacts predicted using this and related approaches has now been demonstrated on many known structures and contact maps, including the prediction of experimentally unsolved transmembrane proteins.

===Comparative protein modeling===

Comparative protein modeling uses previously solved structures as starting points, or templates. This is effective because it appears that although the number of actual proteins is vast, there is a limited set of tertiary structural motifs to which most proteins belong. It has been suggested that there are only around 2,000 distinct protein folds in nature, though there are many millions of different proteins. The comparative protein modeling can combine with the evolutionary covariation in the structure prediction.

These methods may also be split into two groups:
* Homology modeling is based on the reasonable assumption that two homologous proteins will share very similar structures. Because a protein&#x27;s fold is more evolutionarily conserved than its amino acid sequence, a target sequence can be modeled with reasonable accuracy on a very distantly related template, provided that the relationship between target and template can be discerned through sequence alignment. It has been suggested that the primary bottleneck in comparative modelling arises from difficulties in alignment rather than from errors in structure prediction given a known-good alignment. Unsurprisingly, homology modelling is most accurate when the target and template have similar sequences.
* Protein threading scans the amino acid sequence of an unknown structure against a database of solved structures. In each case, a scoring function is used to assess the compatibility of the sequence to the structure, thus yielding possible three-dimensional models. This type of method is also known as 3D-1D fold recognition due to its compatibility analysis between three-dimensional structures and linear protein sequences. This method has also given rise to methods performing an inverse folding search by evaluating the compatibility of a given structure with a large database of sequences, thus predicting which sequences have the potential to produce a given fold.

===Modeling of side-chain conformations===
Accurate packing of the amino acid side chains represents a separate problem in protein structure prediction. Methods that specifically address the problem of predicting side-chain geometry include dead-end elimination and the self-consistent mean field methods. The side chain conformations with low energy are usually determined on the rigid polypeptide backbone and using a set of discrete side chain conformations known as &quot;rotamers&quot;. The methods attempt to identify the set of rotamers that minimize the model&#x27;s overall energy.

These methods use rotamer libraries, which are collections of favorable conformations for each residue type in proteins. Rotamer libraries may contain information about the conformation, its frequency, and the standard deviations about mean dihedral angles, which can be used in sampling. Rotamer libraries are derived from structural bioinformatics or other statistical analysis of side-chain conformations in known experimental structures of proteins, such as by clustering the observed conformations for tetrahedral carbons near the staggered (60°, 180°, −60°) values.

Rotamer libraries can be backbone-independent, secondary-structure-dependent, or backbone-dependent. Backbone-independent rotamer libraries make no reference to backbone conformation, and are calculated from all available side chains of a certain type (for instance, the first example of a rotamer library, done by Ponder and Richards at Yale in 1987). Secondary-structure-dependent libraries present different dihedral angles and/or rotamer frequencies for formula_1-helix, formula_2-sheet, or coil secondary structures. Backbone-dependent rotamer libraries present conformations and/or frequencies dependent on the local backbone conformation as defined by the backbone dihedral angles formula_3 and formula_4, regardless of secondary structure.

The modern versions of these libraries as used in most software are presented as multidimensional distributions of probability or frequency, where the peaks correspond to the dihedral-angle conformations considered as individual rotamers in the lists. Some versions are based on very carefully curated data and are used primarily for structure validation, while others emphasize relative frequencies in much larger data sets and are the form used primarily for structure prediction, such as the Dunbrack rotamer libraries.

Side-chain packing methods are most useful for analyzing the protein&#x27;s hydrophobic core, where side chains are more closely packed; they have more difficulty addressing the looser constraints and higher flexibility of surface residues, which often occupy multiple rotamer conformations rather than just one.

==Quaternary structure==

In the case of complexes of two or more proteins, where the structures of the proteins are known or can be predicted with high accuracy, protein–protein docking methods can be used to predict the structure of the complex. Information of the effect of mutations at specific sites on the affinity of the complex helps to understand the complex structure and to guide docking methods.

==Software==

A great number of software tools for protein structure prediction exist. Approaches include homology modeling, protein threading, &quot;ab initio&quot; methods, secondary structure prediction, and transmembrane helix and signal peptide prediction. In particular, deep learning based on long short-term memory has been used for this purpose since 2007, when it was successfully applied to protein homology detection and to
predict subcellular localization of proteins.
Some recent successful methods based on the CASP experiments include I-TASSER, HHpred and AlphaFold. In 2021, AlphaFold was reported to perform best.

Knowing the structure of a protein often allows functional prediction as well. For instance, collagen is folded into a long-extended fiber-like chain and it makes it a fibrous protein. Recently, several techniques have been developed to predict protein folding and thus protein structure, for example, Itasser, and AlphaFold.

===AI methods===
AlphaFold was one of the first AIs to predict protein structures. It was introduced by Google&#x27;s DeepMind in the 13th CASP competition, which was held in 2018. AlphaFold relies on a neural network approach, which directly predicts the 3D coordinates of all non-hydrogen atoms for a given protein using the amino acid sequence and aligned homologous sequences. The AlphaFold network consists of a trunk which processes the inputs through repeated layers, and a structure module which introduces an explicit 3D structure. Earlier neural networks for protein structure prediction used LSTM.

Since AlphaFold outputs protein coordinates directly, AlphaFold produces predictions in graphics processing unit (GPU) minutes to GPU hours, depending on the length of protein sequence. 

The European Bioinformatics Institute together with DeepMind have constructed the AlphaFold – EBI database for predicted protein structures.

===Current AI methods and databases of predicted protein structures===
AlphaFold2, was introduced in CASP14, and is capable of predicting protein structures to near experimental accuracy. AlphaFold was swiftly followed by RoseTTAFold and later by OmegaFold and the ESM Metagenomic Atlas. 

In a study, Sommer et al. 2022 demonstrated the application of protein structure prediction in genome annotation, specifically in identifying functional protein isoforms using computationally predicted structures, available at https://www.isoform.io. This study highlights the promise of protein structure prediction as a genome annotation tool and presents a practical, structure-guided approach that can be used to enhance the annotation of any genome.

In 2024, David Baker and Demis Hassabis were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their contributions to computational protein modeling, including the development of AlphaFold2, an AI-based model for protein structure prediction. AlphaFold2&#x27;s accuracy has been evaluated against experimentally determined protein structures using metrics such as root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). The median RMSD between different experimental structures of the same protein is approximately 0.6 Å, while the median RMSD between AlphaFold2 predictions and experimental structures is around 1 Å. For regions where AlphaFold2 assigns high confidence, the median RMSD is about 0.6 Å, comparable to the variability observed between different experimental structures. However, in low-confidence regions, the RMSD can exceed 2 Å, indicating greater deviations. In proteins with multiple domains connected by flexible linkers, AlphaFold2 predicts individual domain structures accurately but may assign random relative positions to these domains. Additionally, AlphaFold2 does not account for structural constraints such as the membrane plane, sometimes placing protein domains in positions that would physically clash with the membrane.

===Evaluation of automatic structure prediction servers===
CASP, which stands for Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction, is a community-wide experiment for protein structure prediction taking place every two years since 1994. CASP provides with an opportunity to assess the quality of available human, non-automated methodology (human category) and automatic servers for protein structure prediction (server category, introduced in the CASP7).

The CAMEO3D Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn Server evaluates automated protein structure prediction servers on a weekly basis using blind predictions for newly release protein structures. CAMEO publishes the results on its website.

<text>Water quality refers to the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water based on the standards of its usage. It is most frequently used by reference to a set of standards against which compliance, generally achieved through treatment of the water, can be assessed. The most common standards used to monitor and assess water quality convey the health of ecosystems, safety of human contact, extent of water pollution and condition of drinking water. Water quality has a significant impact on water supply and often determines supply options.

== Impacts on public health ==

Over time, there has been increasing recognition of the importance of drinking water quality and its impact on public health. This has led to increasing protection and management of water quality.

The understanding of the links between water quality and health continues to grow and highlight new potential health crises: from the chronic impacts of infectious diseases on child development through stunting to new evidence on the harms from known contaminants, such as manganese with growing evidence of neurotoxicity in children. In addition, there are many emerging water quality issues—such as microplastics, perfluorinated compounds, and antimicrobial resistance.

== Categories ==
The parameters for water quality are determined by the intended use. Work in the area of water quality tends to be focused on water that is treated for potability, industrial/domestic use, or restoration (of an environment/ecosystem, generally for health of human/aquatic life).

===Human consumption===

Contaminants that may be in untreated water include microorganisms such as viruses, protozoa and bacteria; inorganic contaminants such as salts and metals; organic chemical contaminants from industrial processes and petroleum use; pesticides and herbicides; and radioactive contaminants. Water quality depends on the local geology and ecosystem, as well as human uses such as sewage dispersion, industrial pollution, use of water bodies as a heat sink, and overuse (which may lower the level of the water).

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits the amounts of certain contaminants in tap water provided by US public water systems. The Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes EPA to issue two types of standards:
* &quot;primary standards&quot; regulate substances that potentially affect human health;
* &quot;secondary standards&quot; prescribe aesthetic qualities, those that affect taste, odor, or appearance.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled water. Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of these contaminants does not necessarily indicate that the water poses a health risk.

In urbanized areas around the world, water purification technology is used in municipal water systems to remove contaminants from the source water (surface water or groundwater) before it is distributed to homes, businesses, schools and other recipients. Water drawn directly from a stream, lake, or aquifer and that has no treatment will be of uncertain quality in terms of potability.

The burden of polluted drinking water disproportionally effects under-represented and vulnerable populations. Communities that lack these clean drinking-water services are at risk of contracting water-borne and pollution-related illnesses like Cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio. These communities are often in low-income areas, where human wastewater is discharged into a nearby drainage channel or surface water drain without sufficient treatment, or is used in agricultural irrigation.

===Industrial and domestic use===
Dissolved ions may affect the suitability of water for a range of industrial and domestic purposes. The most familiar of these is probably the presence of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) that interfere with the cleaning action of soap, and can form hard sulfate and soft carbonate deposits in water heaters or boilers. Hard water may be softened to remove these ions. The softening process often substitutes sodium cations. For certain populations, hard water may be preferable to soft water because health problems have been associated with calcium deficiencies and with excess sodium. The necessity for additional calcium and magnesium in water depends on the population in question because people generally satisfy their recommended amounts through food.

===Environmental water quality===

Environmental water quality, also called ambient water quality, relates to water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and oceans. Water quality standards for surface waters vary significantly due to different environmental conditions, ecosystems, and intended human uses. Toxic substances and high populations of certain microorganisms can present a health hazard for non-drinking purposes such as irrigation, swimming, fishing, rafting, boating, and industrial uses. These conditions may also affect wildlife, which use the water for drinking or as a habitat. According to the EPA, water quality laws generally specify protection of fisheries and recreational use and require, as a minimum, retention of current quality standards. In some locations, desired water quality conditions include high dissolved oxygen concentrations, low chlorophyll-a concentrations, and high water clarity. 

There is some desire among the public to return water bodies to pristine, or pre-industrial conditions. Most current environmental laws focus on the designation of particular uses of a water body. In some countries these designations allow for some water contamination as long as the particular type of contamination is not harmful to the designated uses. Given the landscape changes (e.g., land development, urbanization, clearcutting in forested areas) in the watersheds of many freshwater bodies, returning to pristine conditions would be a significant challenge. In these cases, environmental scientists focus on achieving goals for maintaining healthy ecosystems and may concentrate on the protection of populations of endangered species and protecting human health.
==Sampling and measurement==

===Sample collection===

&lt;section begin=sampling /&gt;
The complexity of water quality as a subject is reflected in the many types of measurements of water quality indicators. Some measurements of water quality are most accurately made on-site, because water exists in equilibrium with its surroundings. Measurements commonly made on-site and in direct contact with the water source in question include temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, oxygen reduction potential (ORP), turbidity, and Secchi disk depth.

Sampling of water for physical or chemical testing can be done by several methods, depending on the accuracy needed and the characteristics of the contaminant. Sampling methods include for example simple random sampling, stratified sampling, systematic and grid sampling, adaptive cluster sampling, grab samples, semi-continuous monitoring and continuous, passive sampling, remote surveillance, remote sensing, and biomonitoring. The use of passive samplers greatly reduces the cost and the need of infrastructure on the sampling location.

Many contamination events are sharply restricted in time, most commonly in association with rain events. For this reason &quot;grab&quot; samples are often inadequate for fully quantifying contaminant levels. Scientists gathering this type of data often employ auto-sampler devices that pump increments of water at either time or discharge intervals.&lt;section end=sampling /&gt;

More complex measurements are often made in a laboratory requiring a water sample to be collected, preserved, transported, and analyzed at another location.

==== Issues ====
The process of water sampling introduces two significant problems:
* The first problem is the extent to which the sample may be representative of the water source of interest. Water sources vary with time and with location. The measurement of interest may vary seasonally or from day to night or in response to some activity of man or natural populations of aquatic plants and animals. The measurement of interest may vary with distances from the water boundary with overlying atmosphere and underlying or confining soil. The sampler must determine if a single time and location meets the needs of the investigation, or if the water use of interest can be satisfactorily assessed by averaged values of sampling over time and location, or if critical maxima and minima require individual measurements over a range of times, locations or events. The sample collection procedure must assure correct weighting of individual sampling times and locations where averaging is appropriate. Where critical maximum or minimum values exist, statistical methods must be applied to observed variation to determine an adequate number of samples to assess the probability of exceeding those critical values.
* The second problem occurs as the sample is removed from the water source and begins to establish chemical equilibrium with its new surroundings – the sample container. Sample containers must be made of materials with minimal reactivity with substances to be measured; pre-cleaning of sample containers is important. The water sample may dissolve part of the sample container and any residue on that container, and chemicals dissolved in the water sample may sorb onto the sample container and remain there when the water is poured out for analysis. Similar physical and chemical interactions may take place with any pumps, piping, or intermediate devices used to transfer the water sample into the sample container. Water collected from depths below the surface will normally be held at the reduced pressure of the atmosphere; so gas dissolved in the water will collect at the top of the container. Atmospheric gas above the water may also dissolve into the water sample. Other chemical reaction equilibria may change if the water sample changes temperature. Finely divided solid particles formerly suspended by water turbulence may settle to the bottom of the sample container, or a solid phase may form from biological growth or chemical precipitation. Microorganisms within the water sample may biochemically alter concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and organic compounds. Changing carbon dioxide concentrations may alter pH and change solubility of chemicals of interest. These problems are of special concern during measurement of chemicals assumed to be significant at very low concentrations.
Sample preservation may partially resolve the second problem. A common procedure is keeping samples cold to slow the rate of chemical reactions and phase change, and analyzing the sample as soon as possible; but this merely minimizes the changes rather than preventing them. A useful procedure for determining influence of sample containers during delay between sample collection and analysis involves preparation for two artificial samples in advance of the sampling event. One sample container is filled with water known from previous analysis to contain no detectable amount of the chemical of interest. This sample, called a &quot;blank&quot;, is opened for exposure to the atmosphere when the sample of interest is collected, then resealed and transported to the laboratory with the sample for analysis to determine if sample collection or holding procedures introduced any measurable amount of the chemical of interest. The second artificial sample is collected with the sample of interest, but then &quot;spiked&quot; with a measured additional amount of the chemical of interest at the time of collection. The blank (negative control) and spiked sample (positive control) are carried with the sample of interest and analyzed by the same methods at the same times to determine any changes indicating gains or losses during the elapsed time between collection and analysis.

===Testing in response to natural disasters and other emergencies===

After events such as earthquakes and tsunamis, there is an immediate response by the aid agencies as relief operations get underway to try and restore basic infrastructure and provide the basic fundamental items that are necessary for survival and subsequent recovery. The threat of disease increases hugely due to the large numbers of people living close together, often in squalid conditions, and without proper sanitation.

After a natural disaster, as far as water quality testing is concerned, there are widespread views on the best course of action to take and a variety of methods can be employed. The key basic water quality parameters that need to be addressed in an emergency are bacteriological indicators of fecal contamination, free chlorine residual, pH, turbidity and possibly conductivity/total dissolved solids. There are many decontamination methods.

After major natural disasters, a considerable length of time might pass before water quality returns to pre-disaster levels. For example, following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami the Colombo-based International Water Management Institute (IWMI) monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one and a half years after the event. IWMI developed protocols for cleaning wells contaminated by saltwater; these were subsequently officially endorsed by the World Health Organization as part of its series of Emergency Guidelines.

===Chemical analysis===

The simplest methods of chemical analysis are those measuring chemical elements without respect to their form. Elemental analysis for oxygen, as an example, would indicate a concentration of 890 g/L (grams per litre) of water sample because oxygen (O) has 89% mass of the water molecule (H2O). The method selected to measure dissolved oxygen should differentiate between diatomic oxygen and oxygen combined with other elements. The comparative simplicity of elemental analysis has produced a large amount of sample data and water quality criteria for elements sometimes identified as heavy metals. Water analysis for heavy metals must consider soil particles suspended in the water sample. These suspended soil particles may contain measurable amounts of metal. Although the particles are not dissolved in the water, they may be consumed by people drinking the water. Adding acid to a water sample to prevent loss of dissolved metals onto the sample container may dissolve more metals from suspended soil particles. Filtration of soil particles from the water sample before acid addition, however, may cause loss of dissolved metals onto the filter. The complexities of differentiating similar organic molecules are even more challenging.

Making these complex measurements can be expensive. Because direct measurements of water quality can be expensive, ongoing monitoring programs are typically conducted and results released by government agencies. However, there are local volunteer programs and resources available for some general assessment. Tools available to the general public include on-site test kits, commonly used for home fish tanks, and biological assessment procedures.

===Biosensors===
Biosensors have the potential for &quot;high sensitivity, selectivity, reliability, simplicity, low-cost and real-time response&quot;. For instance, bionanotechnologists reported the development of , that can detect levels of diverse water pollutants.

===Real-time monitoring===
Although water quality is usually sampled and analyzed at laboratories, since the late 20th century there has been increasing public interest in the quality of drinking water provided by municipal systems. Many water utilities have developed systems to collect real-time data about source water quality. In the early 21st century, a variety of sensors and remote monitoring systems have been deployed for measuring water pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and other parameters. Some remote sensing systems have also been developed for monitoring ambient water quality in riverine, estuarine and coastal water bodies.

The following is a list of indicators often measured by situational category:

Biological monitoring metrics have been developed in many places, and one widely used family of measurements for freshwater is the presence and abundance of members of the insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) (of benthic macroinvertebrates whose common names are, respectively, mayfly, stonefly and caddisfly). EPT indexes will naturally vary from region to region, but generally, within a region, the greater the number of taxa from these orders, the better the water quality. Organisations in the United States, such as EPA. offer guidance on developing a monitoring program and identifying members of these and other aquatic insect orders. Many US wastewater dischargers (e.g., factories, power plants, refineries, mines, municipal sewage treatment plants) are required to conduct periodic whole effluent toxicity (WET) tests.

Individuals interested in monitoring water quality who cannot afford or manage lab scale analysis can also use biological indicators to get a general reading of water quality. One example is the IOWATER volunteer water monitoring program of Iowa, which includes an EPT indicator key.

Bivalve molluscs are largely used as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile so that they are representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. A typical project is the U.S. Mussel Watch Programme, but today they are used worldwide.

The Southern African Scoring System (SASS) method is a biological water quality monitoring system based on the presence of benthic macroinvertebrates (EPT). The SASS aquatic biomonitoring tool has been refined over the past 30 years and is now on the fifth version (SASS5) which has been specifically modified in accordance with international standards, namely the ISO/IEC 17025 protocol. The SASS5 method is used by the South African Department of Water Affairs as a standard method for River Health Assessment, which feeds the national River Health Programme and the national Rivers Database.

==Climate change impacts==
==Standards and reports==
In the setting of standards, agencies make political and technical/scientific decisions based on how the water will be used. In the case of natural water bodies, agencies also make some reasonable estimate of pristine conditions. Natural water bodies will vary in response to a region&#x27;s environmental conditions, whereby water composition is influenced by the surrounding geological features, sediments, and rock types, topography, hydrology, and climate. Environmental scientists and aqueous geochemists work to interpret the parameters and environmental conditions that impact the water quality of a region, which in turn helps to identify the sources and fates of contaminants. Environmental lawyers and policymakers work to define legislation with the intention that water is maintained at an appropriate quality for its identified use.

Another general perception of water quality is that of a simple property that tells whether water is polluted or not. In fact, water quality is a complex subject, in part because water is a complex medium intrinsically tied to the ecology, geology, and anthropogenic activities of a region. Industrial and commercial activities (e.g. manufacturing, mining, construction, transport) are a major cause of water pollution as are runoff from agricultural areas, urban runoff and discharge of treated and untreated sewage.

=== International ===

* The World Health Organization (WHO) published updated guidelines for drinking-water quality (GDWQ) in 2017.
*The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published regulation of water quality in the section of ICS 13.060, ranging from water sampling, drinking water, industrial class water, sewage, and examination of water for chemical, physical or biological properties. ICS 91.140.60 covers the standards of water supply systems.

===National specifications for ambient water and drinking water===
====European Union====

The water policy of the European Union is primarily codified in three directives:
*Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment (91/271/EEC) of 21 May 1991 concerning discharges of municipal and some industrial wastewaters;
*The Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC) of 3 November 1998 concerning potable water quality;
*Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) of 23 October 2000 concerning water resources management.

====India====
* Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Standards for Drinking Water.

====South Africa====

Water quality guidelines for South Africa are grouped according to potential user types (e.g. domestic, industrial) in the 1996 Water Quality Guidelines. Drinking water quality is subject to the South African National Standard (SANS) 241 Drinking Water Specification.

====United Kingdom====
In England and Wales acceptable levels for drinking water supply are listed in the &quot;Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000.&quot;

====United States====

In the United States, Water Quality Standards are defined by state agencies for various water bodies, guided by the desired uses for the water body (e.g., fish habitat, drinking water supply, recreational use). The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires each governing jurisdiction (states, territories, and covered tribal entities) to submit a set of biennial reports on the quality of water in their area. These reports are known as the 303(d) and 305(b) reports, named for their respective CWA provisions, and are submitted to, and approved by, EPA. These reports are completed by the governing jurisdiction, typically a state environmental agency. EPA recommends that each state submit a single &quot;Integrated Report&quot; comprising its list of impaired waters and the status of all water bodies in the state. The &quot;National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress&quot; is a general report on water quality, providing overall information about the number of miles of streams and rivers and their aggregate condition. The CWA requires states to adopt standards for each of the possible designated uses that they assign to their waters. Should evidence suggest or document that a stream, river or lake has failed to meet the water quality criteria for one or more of its designated uses, it is placed on a list of impaired waters. Once a state has placed a water body on this list, it must develop a management plan establishing Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for the pollutant(s) impairing the use of the water. These TMDLs establish the reductions needed to fully support the designated uses.

Drinking water standards, which are applicable to public water systems, are issued by EPA under the Safe Drinking Water Act.

<text>Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS) is an installation of the United States Space Force&#x27;s Space Launch Delta 45, located on Cape Canaveral in Brevard County, Florida.

Headquartered at the nearby Patrick Space Force Base, the station is the primary launch site for the Space Force&#x27;s Eastern Range with three launch pads currently active (Space Launch Complexes 40, 41 and 46). The facility is south-southeast of NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center on adjacent Merritt Island, with the two linked by bridges and causeways. The Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Skid Strip provides a runway close to the launch complexes for military airlift aircraft delivering heavy and outsized payloads to the Cape.

A number of American space exploration pioneers were launched from CCSFS, including the first U.S. Earth satellite (1958), first U.S. astronaut (1961), first U.S. astronaut in orbit (1962), first two-man U.S. spacecraft (1965), first U.S. uncrewed lunar landing (1966), and first three-man U.S. spacecraft (1968). It was also the launch site for all of the first spacecraft to (separately) fly past each of the planets in the Solar System (1962–1977), the first spacecraft to orbit Mars (1971) and roam its surface (1996), the first American spacecraft to orbit and land on Venus (1978), the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn (2004), and to orbit Mercury (2011), and the first spacecraft to leave the Solar System (1977). Portions of the base have been designated a National Historic Landmark for their association with the early years of the American space program.

Cape Canaveral was known as Cape Canaveral Launch Area upon its foundation in 1949, but renamed to LRPG Launching Area in 1950. It was known as Cape Canaveral Auxiliary Air Force Base from 1951 to 1955, and Cape Canaveral Missile Test Annex from 1955 to 1964. The facility was later known as Cape Kennedy Air Force Station from 1964 to 1974, and as Cape Canaveral Air Force Station from 1974 to 1994 and from 2000 to 2020, taking the designation Cape Canaveral Air Station from 1994 to 2000. The facility was renamed &quot;Cape Canaveral Space Force Station&quot; in December 2020.

== History ==
The CCSFS area had been used by the United States government to test missiles since 1949, when President Harry S. Truman established the Joint Long Range Proving Ground at Cape Canaveral. The location was among the best in the continental United States for this purpose, as it allowed for launches out over the Atlantic Ocean, and is closer to the equator than most other parts of the United States, allowing rockets to get a boost from the Earth&#x27;s rotation.

=== Air Force proving ground ===
On June 1, 1948, the United States Navy transferred the former Banana River Naval Air Station to the United States Air Force, with the Air Force renaming the facility the Joint Long Range Proving Ground (JLRPG) Base on June 10, 1949. On October 1, 1949, the Joint Long Range Proving Ground Base was transferred from the Air Materiel Command to the Air Force Division of the Joint Long Range Proving Ground. On May 17, 1950, the base was renamed the Long Range Proving Ground Base but three months later was renamed Patrick Air Force Base, in honor of Major General Mason Patrick of the U.S. Army. In 1951, the Air Force established the Air Force Missile Test Center.

Early American sub-orbital rocket flights were achieved at Cape Canaveral in 1956. These flights occurred shortly after sub-orbital flights launched from White Sands Missile Range, such as the Viking 12 sounding rocket on February 4, 1955.

Following the Soviet Union&#x27;s successful Sputnik 1 (launched on October 4, 1957), the United States attempted its first launch of an artificial satellite from Cape Canaveral on December 6, 1957. However, the rocket carrying Vanguard TV3 exploded on the launch pad.

NASA was founded in 1958, and Air Force crews launched missiles for NASA from the Cape, known then as Cape Canaveral Missile Annex. Redstone, Jupiter, Pershing 1, Pershing 1a, Pershing II, Polaris, Thor, Atlas, Titan and Minuteman missiles were all tested from the site, the Thor becoming the basis for the expendable launch vehicle (ELV) Delta rocket, which launched Telstar 1 in July 1962. The row of Titan (LC-15, 16, 19, 20) and Atlas (LC-11, 12, 13, 14) launch pads along the coast came to be known as Missile Row in the 1960s.

=== Project Mercury ===


NASA&#x27;s first crewed spaceflight program was prepared for launch from Canaveral by U.S. Air Force crews. Mercury&#x27;s objectives were to place a crewed spacecraft into Earth&#x27;s orbit, investigate human performance and ability to function in space, and safely recover the astronaut and spacecraft. Suborbital flights were launched by derivatives of the Army&#x27;s Redstone missile from LC-5; two such flights were manned by Alan Shepard on May 5, 1961, and Gus Grissom on July 21. Orbital flights were launched by derivatives of the Air Force&#x27;s larger Atlas D missile from LC-14. The first American in orbit was John Glenn on February 20, 1962. Three more orbital flights followed through May 1963.

Flight control for all Mercury missions was provided at the Mercury Control Center located at Canaveral near LC-14.

=== Name changes ===
On November 29, 1963, following the death of President John F. Kennedy, his successor Lyndon B. Johnson issued renaming both NASA&#x27;s Merritt Island Launch Operations Center and &quot;the facilities of Station No. 1 of the Atlantic Missile Range&quot; (a reference to the Cape Canaveral Missile Test Annex) as the &quot;John F. Kennedy Space Center&quot;. He had also convinced Governor C. Farris Bryant (D-Fla.) to change the name of Cape Canaveral to &quot;Cape Kennedy&quot;. This resulted in some confusion in public perception, which conflated the two. NASA Administrator James E. Webb clarified this by issuing a directive stating the &quot;Kennedy Space Center&quot; name applied only to Merritt Island, while the Air Force issued a general order renaming the Air Force launch site &quot;Cape Kennedy Air Force Station&quot;. This name was used through the Project Gemini and early Apollo program.

However, the geographical name change proved to be unpopular, owing to the historical longevity of Cape Canaveral (one of the oldest place-names in the United States, dating to the early 1500s). In 1973 and 1974 respectively, both the geographical and the Air Force Station Cape names were reverted to Canaveral after the Florida legislature passed a bill changing the name back that was signed into law by Florida governor Reubin Askew (D-Fla.).

On August 7, 2020, U.S. military contracts referred to the installation as Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The installation was formally renamed on December 9, 2020.

=== Gemini and early Apollo ===

The two-man Gemini spacecraft was launched into orbit by a derivative of the Air Force Titan II missile. Twelve Gemini flights were launched from LC-19, ten of which were crewed. The first crewed flight, Gemini 3, took place on March 23, 1965. Later Gemini flights were supported by seven uncrewed launches of the Agena Target Vehicle on the Atlas-Agena from LC-14, to develop rendezvous and docking, critical for Apollo. Two of the Atlas-Agena vehicles failed to reach orbit on Gemini 6 and Gemini 9, and a mis-rigging of the nosecone on a third caused it to fail to eject in orbit, preventing docking on Gemini 9A. The final flight, Gemini 12, launched on November 11, 1966.

The capabilities of the Mercury Control Center were inadequate for the flight control needs of Gemini and Apollo, so NASA built an improved Mission Control Center in 1963, which it decided to locate at the newly built Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, rather than at Canaveral or at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.

The Apollo program&#x27;s goal of landing a man on the Moon required development of the Saturn family of rockets. The large Saturn V rocket necessary to take men to the Moon required a larger launch facility than Cape Canaveral could provide, so NASA built the Kennedy Space Center located west and north of Canaveral on Merritt Island. But the earlier Saturn I and IB could be launched from the Cape&#x27;s Launch Complexes 34 and 37. The first four Saturn I development launches were made from LC-34 between October 27, 1961, and March 28, 1963. These were followed by the final test launch and five operational launches from LC-37 between January 29, 1964, and July 30, 1965.

The Saturn IB uprated the capability of the Saturn I, so that it could be used for Earth orbital tests of the Apollo spacecraft. Two uncrewed test launches of the Apollo command and service module (CSM), AS-201 and AS-202, were made from LC-34, and an uncrewed flight (AS-203) to test the behavior of upper stage liquid hydrogen fuel in orbit from LC-37, between February 26 and August 25, 1966. The first crewed CSM flight, AS-204 or Apollo 1, was planned to launch from LC-34 on February 21, 1967, but the entire crew of Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee were killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on pad 34 on January 27, 1967. The AS-204 rocket was used to launch the uncrewed, Earth orbital first test flight of the Apollo Lunar Module, Apollo 5, from LC-37 on January 22, 1968. After significant safety improvements were made to the Command Module, Apollo 7 was launched from LC-34 to fulfill Apollo 1&#x27;s mission, using Saturn IB AS-205 on October 11, 1968.

In 1972, NASA deactivated both LC-34 and LC-37. It briefly considered reactivating both for Apollo Applications Program launches after the end of Apollo, but instead modified the Kennedy Space Center launch complex to handle the Saturn IB for the Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project launches. The LC-34 service structure and umbilical tower were razed, leaving only the concrete launch pedestal as a monument to the Apollo 1 crew. In 2001, LC-37 was recommissioned and converted to service Delta IV launch vehicles.

=== Subsequent activity ===
The Air Force chose to expand the capabilities of the Titan launch vehicles for its heavy lift capabilities. The Air Force constructed Launch Complexes 40 and 41 to launch Titan III and Titan IV rockets just south of Kennedy Space Center. A Titan III has about the same payload capacity as the Saturn IB at a considerable cost savings.

Launch Complex 40 and 41 have been used to launch defense reconnaissance, communications and weather satellites and NASA planetary missions. The Air Force also planned to launch two Air Force crewed space projects from LC 40 and 41. They were the Dyna-Soar, a crewed orbital rocket plane (canceled in 1963) and the USAF Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL), a crewed reconnaissance space station (canceled in 1969).

From 1974 to 1977 the powerful Titan-Centaur became the new heavy lift vehicle for NASA, launching the Viking and Voyager series of spacecraft from Launch Complex 41. Complex 41 later became the launch site for the most powerful uncrewed U.S. rocket, the Titan IV, developed by the Air Force.

With increased use of a leased launch pad by private company SpaceX, the Air Force launch support operations at the Cape planned for 21 launches in 2014, a fifty percent increase over the 2013 launch rate. SpaceX had reservations for a total of ten of those launches in 2014, with an option for an eleventh.

== Uncrewed launches at Cape Canaveral ==
The first United States satellite launch, Explorer 1, was made by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency on February 1, 1958 (UTC) from Canaveral&#x27;s LC-26A using a Juno I RS-29 missile. NASA&#x27;s first launch, Pioneer 1, came on October 11 of the same year from LC-17A using a Thor-Able rocket.

Besides Project Gemini, the Atlas-Agena launch complexes LC-12 and LC-13 were used during the 1960s for the uncrewed Ranger and Lunar Orbiter programs and the first five Mariner interplanetary probes. The Atlas-Centaur launch complex LC-36 was used for the 1960s Surveyor uncrewed lunar landing program and the last five Mariner probes through 1973.

NASA has also launched communications and weather satellites from Launch Complexes 40 and 41, built at the north end of the Cape in 1964 by the Air Force for its Titan IIIC and Titan IV rockets. From 1974 to 1977 the powerful Titan IIIE served as the heavy-lift vehicle for NASA, launching the Viking and Voyager series of planetary spacecraft and the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; Saturn probe from LC-41.

Three Cape Canaveral pads are currently operated by private industry for military and civilian launches: SLC-41 for United Launch Alliance&#x27;s Atlas V and Vulcan Centaur; LC-36 for Blue Origin&#x27;s New Glenn and SLC-40 for the SpaceX Falcon 9.

=== Boeing X-37B ===
The Boeing X-37B, a reusable uncrewed spacecraft operated by USSF, which is also known as the Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV), has been successfully launched four times from Cape Canaveral. The first four X-37B missions have been launched with Atlas V rockets. Past launch dates for the X-37B spaceplane include April 22, 2010, March 5, 2011, December 11, 2012, and May 20, 2015. The fourth X-37B mission landed at the Kennedy Space Center on May 7, 2017, after 718 days in orbit. The first three X-37B missions all made successful autonomous landings from space to a runway located at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California which was originally designed for Space Shuttle return from orbit operations.

== Operations, infrastructure and facilities ==

Of the launch complexes built since 1950, several have been leased and modified for use by private aerospace companies. Launch Complex SLC-17 was used for the Delta II Heavy variant, through 2011. Launch Complexes SLC-37 and SLC-41 were modified to launch EELV Delta IV and Atlas V launch vehicles, respectively. These launch vehicles replaced all earlier Delta, Atlas, and Titan rockets. Launch Complex SLC-47 is used to launch weather sounding rockets. Launch Complex SLC-46 is reserved for use by Space Florida.

SLC-40 hosted the first launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 in June 2010. Falcon 9 launches continued from this complex through 2015, consisting of uncrewed Commercial Resupply Services missions for NASA to the International Space Station as well as commercial satellite flights. On September 30th, 2024, SpaceX launched the first crewed flight from SLC-40. SpaceX has also leased Launch Complex 39A from NASA and has completed modifying it to accommodate Falcon Heavy and Commercial Crew crewed spaceflights to the ISS with their Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019. SpaceX Landing Zone 1 and 2, used to land first stages of the Falcon 9 and the side boosters of the Falcon Heavy, are located at the site of the former LC-13.

On September 16, 2015, NASA announced that Blue Origin has leased Launch Complex 36 and will modify it as a launch site for their next-generation launch vehicles.

In the case of low-inclination (geostationary) launches the location of the area at 28°27&#x27;N put it at a slight disadvantage against other launch facilities situated nearer the equator. The boost eastward from the Earth&#x27;s rotation is about at Cape Canaveral, but at the European Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana.

In the case of high-inclination (polar) launches, the latitude does not matter, but the Cape Canaveral area is not suitable, because inhabited areas underlie these trajectories; Vandenberg Space Force Base, Cape Canaveral&#x27;s West Coast counterpart, or the smaller Pacific Spaceport Complex – Alaska (PSCA) are used instead.

The Cape Canaveral Space Force Museum is located at LC-26. Hangar AE, located in the CCAFS Industrial Area, collects telemetry from launches all over the United States. NASA&#x27;s Launch Services Program has three Launch Vehicle Data Centers (LVDC) within that display telemetry real-time for engineers.

=== Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Skid Strip ===
Cape Canaveral Space Force Station Skid Strip is a military airport at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS), northeast of Cocoa Beach, Florida. It has an asphalt-paved runway designated 13/31 and measuring . The facility is owned by the United States Space Force (USSF).

This airport is assigned a three-letter location identifier of XMR by the Federal Aviation Administration, but it does not have an International Air Transport Association (IATA) airport code.

The runway was first called the Skid Strip because SM-62 Snark cruise missiles (which lacked wheels) returning from test flights were supposed to skid to a halt on it.

In the 1960s the Douglas C-133 Cargomaster was a frequent visitor, carrying modified Atlas and Titan missiles, used as launch vehicles for crewed and uncrewed space programs leading to the Apollo Moon landings. The Skid Strip was used by NASA&#x27;s Pregnant Guppy and Super Guppy transport aircraft carrying the S-IVB upper stage for the Saturn IB and Saturn V rockets used in Apollo program.

Today, it is predominantly used by USAF C-130 Hercules, C-17 Globemaster III and C-5 Galaxy aircraft transporting satellite payloads to CCSFS for mating with launch vehicles.

The CCSFS Skid Strip is sometimes confused with the NASA Shuttle Landing Facility, but that runway, specially constructed for the Space Shuttle, is located on Merritt Island at the adjacent Kennedy Space Center.

=== Naval Ordnance Test Unit ===
A tenant command located at Cape Canaveral SFS is the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval Ordnance Test Unit (NOTU). As a major shore command led by a Navy captain, NOTU was created in 1950 and initially directed almost all of its efforts towards the development and subsequent support of the submarine-launched Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) program. This resulted in NOTU being assigned to the director of special projects (now strategic systems programs) with a mission to support the development of the Polaris missile and later the Poseidon missile programs.

NOTU&#x27;s mission is the support and testing of sea-based weapons systems for the United States Navy and the Royal Navy in a safe environment utilizing the airspace and waterspace of the Eastern Range. The command directly supports the mission capability and readiness of the United States Navy&#x27;s Trident Submarines as well as the Fleet Ballistic Missile program of the United Kingdom. NOTU operates the Navy Port at Port Canaveral, supporting submarines and surface ships of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, NATO, Allied and other foreign navies, and assets of the Military Sealift Command. NOTU is composed of over 100 active duty U.S. Navy personnel and over 70 defense contractors.

=== Notable Launch Complexes ===
Listed below in this article are less notable launch complexes at the Cape. For a complete list of all launch complexes, see the below table.
=== LC-1 ===
Launch Complex 1 (LC-1) is located on the eastern tip of Cape Canaveral. It was constructed in the early 1950s for the Snark missile program.

The first launch from this site was conducted on January 13, 1955. The complex was used for Snark missions until 1960, and then was utilized as a helicopter pad during Project Mercury. The final use of the site was from 1983 to 1989 for tethered aerostat balloon radar missions. It is now deactivated.

=== LC-2 ===
Launch Complex 2 (LC-2) is a deactivated launch site on the eastern tip of Cape Canaveral. It was constructed with launch complexes 1, 3, and 4, in the early 1950s, for the Snark missile program.

The first launch from this site was a Snark test conducted on February 18, 1954. The complex was used for Snark missions until 1960, and then was utilized as a helicopter pad during Project Mercury. The final use of the site was during the 1980s for tethered aerostat balloon radar missions.

=== LC-3 ===
Launch Complex 3 (LC-3) is a deactivated launch site southeast of SLC-36 at Cape Canaveral. It was constructed, with launch complexes 1, 2, and 4, in the early 1950s for the Snark missile program.

It was formerly used to launch Bumper, BOMARC, UGM-27 Polaris, and Lockheed X-17 missiles. The pad was also the site of the first launch from Cape Canaveral, a Bumper rocket on July 24, 1950. The site also served as a medical support facility during Project Mercury.

In 2023, after weeks of searching, students from the University of Central Florida, working with archaeologists, discovered the site of the original blockhouse supporting the first Bumper launch just north of the pad at LC-3, including the slab foundation and some of the surrounding Marston mat, all long-buried under heavy scrub.

=== LC-4 ===
Launch Complex 4 (LC-4) was one of the first launch complexes to be built at Cape Canaveral. It consisted of two pads: LC-4, which was used for 25 launches of Bomarc, Matador and Redstone missiles between 1952 and 1960; and LC-4A, which was used for three Bomarc launches between 1958 and 1959.

Following its deactivation in 1960, the original structures at the complex were dismantled. New facilities were built at the site in the 1980s, and it was used for TARS aerostat operations between 1983 and 1989. Following this, the aerostat launch facilities were also removed, and the complex is currently not accessible to the public.

=== LC-9 ===

Launch Complex 9 (LC-9) is a small concrete structure consisting of an elevated launch pedestal and flame trench, centered on a small oval-shaped concrete pad.. It is north of Launch Complex 17.

It was used for ten test launches of SM-64 Navaho supersonic nuclear-armed cruise missiles. In addition to LC-9, Navaho tests were also conducted at LC-10 and Edwards Air Force Base. The Navaho was canceled after poor performance in testing: eight of the eleven test launches of the final prototype failed. All of the failed launches were conducted from LC-9.

, the concrete launch structure is still standing, but is not maintained; and the launch support equipment has been removed. The site is not accessible to the general public.

=== LC-10 ===
Launch Complex 10 (LC-10) was used for one SM-64 Navaho missile launch, and later Jason sounding rockets and the Alpha Draco research missile. It was located north of Launch Complex 17, where Launch Complexes 31 and 32 are now located.

A single Navaho missile was test-launched from LC-10, on August 12, 1957, and was one of only three Navahos to complete a successful flight. Following the cancellation of the Navaho, LC-10 was reused for launches of Jason and Draco sounding rockets during 1958 and 1959. The last launch to use the site was of a Draco on April 27, 1959.

LC-10 was subsequently demolished during the construction of Launch Complexes 31 and 32, which were built on the same site.

=== LC-15 ===
Launch Complex 15 (LC-15) was used by LGM-25 Titan missiles between 1959 and 1964. It was originally built for conducting test flights of the Titan I, which made its maiden flight from LC-15 on February 6, 1959. LC-15 is the southernmost of the four original Titan launch complexes on Missile Row.

The last of ten Titan I launches from LC-15 occurred in September 1960. Following this, it was converted for use by the Titan II, which made the first of 16 flights from the complex in June 1962. The last launch from LC-15 occurred on April 9, 1964.

Following the last launch, LC-15 remained active until its retirement from service. Much of the complex, including the tower, launch stand and erector was demolished in June 1967. The blockhouse, cable tunnel, and parts of the launch table and ramp were abandoned in place, and were all still standing until the demolition of the blockhouse in 2011.

On March 7, 2023, the Space Force allocated the complex, which was renamed SLC-15, to ABL Space Systems. ABL plans to build a launch installation for their RS1 small class launch vehicle.

=== LC-25 ===

Launch Complex 25 (LC-25) was a four-pad site built for test flights of the US Navy&#x27;s submarine-launched ballistic missiles Polaris, Poseidon and Trident It was active from 1958 to 1979.

Pads 25A and 25B were built in 1957. Pad 25B was initially built with an underground launch mechanism known as a ship motion simulator to simulate the roll and pitch of a submarine. It was first used August 14, 1959, and was mothballed in October 1961. Pads 25C and 25D were added in May 1968 for the larger Poseidon. One blockhouse served all four pads; it was extensively reinforced when the Poseidon pads were added.

The complex was dismantled in 1979.

In November 2012, ground was broken for a new $185-million Navy missile test facility to be built over the underground structures at LC-25 and LC-29 called the Strategic Weapon System Ashore. The facility will allow the testing of fire control, launch systems and navigation for submarine-fired missiles to be conducted at one facility instead of being done by contractors in different locations around the country.
