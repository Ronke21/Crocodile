<doc id="295335" wikidata="Q2001966" url="?curid=295335" title="Company rule in India">
<text>Company rule in India (also known as the Company Raj, from Hindi , ) refers to regions of the Indian subcontinent under the control of the British East India Company (EIC). The EIC, founded in 1600, established their first trading post in India in 1612, and gradually expanded their presence in the region over the following decades. During the Seven Years&#x27; War, the East India Company began a process of rapid expansion in India which resulted in most of the subcontinent falling under their rule by 1857, when the Indian Rebellion of 1857 broke out. After the rebellion was suppressed, the Government of India Act 1858 resulted in the EIC&#x27;s territories in India being administered by the Crown instead. The India Office managed the EIC&#x27;s former territories, which became known as the British Raj.

The range of dates is taken to have commenced either in 1757 after the Battle of Plassey, when the Nawab of Bengal Siraj ud-Daulah was defeated and replaced with Mir Jafar, who had the support of the East India Company; or in 1765, when the Company was granted the &quot;diwani&quot;, or the right to collect revenue, in Bengal and Bihar; or in 1773, when the Company abolished local rule (Nizamat) in Bengal and established a capital in Calcutta, appointed its first Governor-General of Fort William, Warren Hastings, and became directly involved in governance. The East India Company significantly expanded its influence throughout the Indian subcontinent after the Anglo-Mysore Wars, Anglo-Maratha Wars, and Anglo-Sikh Wars. Lord William Bentinck became the first Governor General of India in 1834 under the Government of India Act 1833.

==Expansion and territory==
The English East India Company (&quot;the Company&quot;) was founded in 1600, as &quot;The Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies&quot;. It gained a foothold in India with the establishment of a factory in Masulipatnam on the Eastern coast of India in 1611 and the grant of the rights to establish a factory in Surat in 1612 by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. In 1640, after receiving similar permission from the Vijayanagara ruler further south, a second factory was established in Madras on the southeastern coast. Bombay island, not far from Surat, a former Portuguese outpost gifted to England as dowry in the marriage of Catherine of Braganza to Charles II, was leased by the Company in 1668. Following the Anglo-Mughal War, the Company was allowed by Emperor Aurangzeb to establish a presence on the eastern coast as well; far up that coast, in the Ganges Delta, a factory was set up in Calcutta. Since, during this time other &quot;companies&quot;—established by the Portuguese, Dutch, French, and Danish—were similarly expanding in the region, the English Company&#x27;s unremarkable beginnings on coastal India offered no clues to what would become a lengthy presence on the Indian subcontinent.

The company&#x27;s victory under Robert Clive in the 1757 Battle of Plassey and another victory in the 1764 Battle of Buxar (in Bihar) consolidated the company&#x27;s power and forced emperor Shah Alam II to appoint it the &quot;diwan&quot;, or revenue collector, of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. The Company thus became the de facto ruler of large areas of the lower Gangetic plain by 1773. It also proceeded by degrees to expand its dominions around Bombay and Madras. The Anglo-Mysore Wars (1766–1799) and the Anglo-Maratha Wars (1772–1818) left it in control of large areas of India south of the Sutlej River. With the defeat of the Marathas, no native power represented a threat for the Company any longer.

The expansion of the company&#x27;s power chiefly took two forms. The first of these was the outright annexation of Indian states and subsequent direct governance of the underlying regions, which collectively came to comprise British India. The annexed regions included the North-Western Provinces (comprising Rohilkhand, Gorakhpur, and the Doab) (1801), Delhi (1803), Assam (Ahom Kingdom 1828), and Sindh (1843). Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir, were annexed after the Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1849-1856 (Period of tenure of Marquess of Dalhousie Governor General); however, Kashmir was immediately sold under the Treaty of Amritsar (1850) to the Dogra dynasty of Jammu, and thereby became a princely state. In 1854 Berar was annexed, and the state of Oudh two years later.

The second form of asserting power involved treaties in which Indian rulers acknowledged the company&#x27;s hegemony in return for limited internal autonomy. Since the Company operated under financial constraints, it had to set up &quot;political&quot; underpinnings for its rule. The most important such support came from the &quot;subsidiary alliances&quot; with Indian princes during the first 75 years of Company rule. In the early 19th century, the territories of these princes accounted for two-third of India. When an Indian ruler, who was able to secure his territory, wanted to enter such an alliance, the Company welcomed it as an economical method of indirect rule, which did not involve the economic costs of direct administration or the political costs of gaining the support of alien subjects.

In return, the Company undertook the &quot;defence of these subordinate allies and treated them with traditional respect and marks of honor.&quot; Subsidiary alliances created the princely states, of the Hindu maharajas and the Muslim nawabs. Prominent among the princely states were: Cochin (1791), Jaipur (1794), Travancore (1795), Hyderabad (1798), Mysore (1799), Cis-Sutlej Hill States (1815), Central India Agency (1819), Cutch and Gujarat Gaikwad territories (1807–1820), Rajputana (1818), and Bahawalpur (1833).

==Regulation of Company rule==

Until Clive&#x27;s victory at Plassey, the East India Company territories in India, which consisted largely of the presidency towns of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, were governed by the mostly autonomous—and sporadically unmanageable—&quot;town councils&quot;, all composed of merchants. The councils barely had enough powers for the effective management of their local affairs, and the ensuing lack of oversight of the overall Company operations in India led to some grave abuses by Company officers or their allies. Clive&#x27;s victory, and the award of the &quot;diwani&quot; of the rich region of Bengal, brought India into the public spotlight in Britain. The company&#x27;s money management practices came to be questioned, especially as it began to post net losses even as some Company servants, the &quot;Nabobs&quot;, returned to Britain with large fortunes, which—according to rumours then current—were acquired unscrupulously. By 1772, the Company needed British government loans to stay afloat, and there was fear in London that the company&#x27;s corrupt practices could soon seep into British business and public life. The rights and duties of the British government with regards the company&#x27;s new territories also came to be examined. The British parliament then held several inquiries and in 1773, during the premiership of Lord North, enacted the Regulating Act 1773, which established regulations, its long title stated, &quot;for the better Management of the Affairs of the &quot;East India Company&quot;, as well in &quot;India&quot; as in &quot;Europe&quot;&quot;.

Although Lord North himself wanted the company&#x27;s territories to be taken over by the British state, he faced determined political opposition from many quarters, including some in the City of London and the Parliament of Great Britain. The result was a compromise in which the Regulating Act—although implying the ultimate sovereignty of the British Crown over these new territories—asserted that the company could act as a sovereign power on behalf of the Crown. It could do this while concurrently being subject to oversight and regulation by the British government and parliament. The Court of Directors of the company were required under the act to submit all communications regarding civil, military, and revenue matters in India for scrutiny by the British government. For the governance of the Indian territories, the act asserted the supremacy of the Presidency of Fort William (Bengal) over those of Fort St. George (Madras) and Bombay. It also nominated a Governor-General (Warren Hastings) and four councillors for administering the Bengal Presidency (and for overseeing the company&#x27;s operations in India). &quot;The subordinate Presidencies were forbidden to wage war or make treaties without the previous consent of the Governor-General of Bengal in Council, except in case of imminent necessity. The Governors of these Presidencies were directed in general terms to obey the orders of the Governor-General-in-Council, and to transmit to him intelligence of all important matters.&quot; However, the imprecise wording of the Act left it open to be variously interpreted; consequently, the administration in India continued to be hobbled by disunity between the provincial governors, between members of the council, and between the Governor-General himself and his Council. The &quot;Regulating Act&quot; also attempted to address the prevalent corruption in India: Company servants were henceforth forbidden to engage in private trade in India or to receive &quot;presents&quot; from Indian nationals.

In 1783, the Fox–North coalition tried to reform colonial policy again with a bill introduced by Edmund Burke which would have transferred political power over India from the East India Company to a parliamentary commission. The bill passed the House of Commons with the enthusiastic support of Foreign Secretary Charles James Fox, but was vetoed by the House of Lords under pressure from King George III, who then dismissed the government and formed a new ministry under Fox&#x27;s rival William Pitt the Younger. Pitt&#x27;s India Act left the East India Company in political control of India but established a Board of Control in England both to supervise the East India Company&#x27;s affairs and to prevent the company&#x27;s shareholders from interfering in the governance of India. The Board of Control consisted of six members, which included one Secretary of State from the British cabinet, as well as the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Around this time, there was also extensive debate in the British Parliament on the issue of landed rights in Bengal, with a consensus developing in support of the view advocated by Philip Francis, a member of the Bengal council and political adversary of Warren Hastings, that all lands in Bengal should be considered the &quot;estate and inheritance of native land-holders and families&quot;.

Mindful of the reports of abuse and corruption in Bengal by Company servants, the India Act itself noted numerous complaints that divers Rajahs, Zamindars, Talukdars, and landholders&#x27; had been unjustly deprived of &#x27;their lands, jurisdictions, rights, and privileges. At the same time the company&#x27;s directors were now leaning towards Francis&#x27;s view that the land-tax in Bengal should be made fixed and permanent, setting the stage for the Permanent Settlement (see section Revenue collection below). The India Act also created in each of the three presidencies a number of administrative and military posts, which included: a Governor and three Councilors, one of which was the Commander in Chief of the Presidency army. Although the supervisory powers of the Governor-General-in-Council in Bengal (over Madras and Bombay) were extended—as they were again in the Charter Act 1793—the subordinate presidencies continued to exercise some autonomy until both the extension of British possessions into becoming contiguous and the advent of faster communications in the next century.

Still, the new Governor-General appointed in 1786, Lord Cornwallis, not only had more power than Hastings, but also had the support of a powerful British cabinet minister, Henry Dundas, who, as Secretary of State for the Home Office, was in charge of the overall India policy. From 1784 onwards, the British government had the final word on all major appointments in India; a candidate&#x27;s suitability for a senior position was often decided by the strength of his political connections rather than that of his administrative ability. Although this practice resulted in many Governor-General nominees being chosen from Britain&#x27;s conservative landed gentry, there were some liberals as well, such as Lord William Bentinck and Lord Dalhousie.

British political opinion was also shaped by the attempted Impeachment of Warren Hastings; the trial, whose proceedings began in 1788, ended with Hastings&#x27; acquittal, in 1795. Although the effort was chiefly coordinated by Edmund Burke, it also drew support from within the British government. Burke accused Hastings not only of corruption, but—appealing to universal standards of justice—also of acting solely upon his own discretion, without concern for law, and of wilfully causing distress to others in India. Hastings&#x27; defenders countered that his actions were consistent with Indian customs and traditions. Although Burke&#x27;s speeches at the trial drew applause and focused attention on India, Hastings was eventually acquitted, due in part to the revival of nationalism in Britain in the wake of the French Revolution. Nonetheless, Burke&#x27;s effort had the effect of creating a sense of responsibility in British public life for the company&#x27;s dominion in India.

Soon rumblings appeared amongst merchants in London that the monopoly granted to the East India Company in 1600, intended to facilitate its competition against Dutch and French in a distant region, was no longer needed. In response, in the Charter Act 1813, the British Parliament renewed the company&#x27;s charter but terminated its monopoly except with regard to tea and trade with China, opening India both to private investment and missionaries. With increased British power in India, supervision of Indian affairs by the British Crown and Parliament increased as well. By the 1820s British nationals could transact business or engage in missionary work under the protection of the Crown in the three presidencies. Finally, under the terms of the Saint Helena Act 1833, the British Parliament revoked the company&#x27;s monopoly in the China trade and made it an agent for the administration of British India. The Governor-General of Bengal was redesignated as the Governor-General of India. The Governor-General and his executive council were given exclusive legislative powers for the whole of British India. Since the British territories in north India had now extended up to Delhi, the act also sanctioned the creation of a Presidency of Agra. With the annexation of Oudh in 1856, this territory was extended and eventually became the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. In addition, in 1854, a lieutenant-governor was appointed for the region of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha, leaving the Governor-General to concentrate on the governance of India as a whole.
==Revenue collection==

In the remnant of the Mughal Empire revenue system existing in pre-1765 Bengal, zamindars, or &quot;land holders&quot;, collected revenue on behalf of the Mughal emperor, whose representative, or &quot;diwan&quot;, supervised their activities. In this system, the assortment of rights associated with land were not possessed by a &quot;land owner&quot;, but rather shared by the several parties with stake in the land, including the peasant cultivator, the &quot;zamindar&quot;, and the state. The &quot;zamindar&quot; served as an intermediary who procured rent from the cultivator, and after withholding a percentage for his own expenses, made available the rest, as revenue to the state. Under the Mughal system, the land itself belonged to the state and not to the &quot;zamindar&quot;, who could transfer only his right to collect rent. On being awarded the &quot;diwani&quot; or overlordship of Bengal following the Battle of Buxar in 1764, the East India Company found itself short of trained administrators, especially those familiar with local custom and law; tax collection was consequently farmed out. This uncertain foray into land taxation by the company, may have gravely worsened the impact of a famine that struck Bengal in 1769–70, in which between seven and ten million people—or between a quarter and third of the presidency&#x27;s population—may have died. However, the company provided little relief either through reduced taxation or by relief efforts, and the economic and cultural impact of the famine was felt decades later, even becoming, a century later, the subject of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee&#x27;s novel &quot;Anandamath&quot;.

In 1772, under Warren Hastings, the East India Company took over revenue collection directly in the Bengal Presidency (then Bengal and Bihar), establishing a Board of Revenue with offices in Calcutta and Patna, and moving the pre-existing Mughal revenue records from Murshidabad to Calcutta.
In 1773, after Oudh ceded the tributary state of Benaras, the revenue collection system was extended to the territory with a Company Resident in charge. The following year—with a view to preventing corruption—Company &quot;district collectors&quot;, who were then responsible for revenue collection for an entire district, were replaced with provincial councils at Patna, Murshidabad, and Calcutta, and with Indian collectors working within each district. The title, &quot;collector&quot;, reflected &quot;the centrality of land revenue collection to government in India: it was the government&#x27;s primary function and it moulded the institutions and patterns of administration&quot;.

The Company inherited a revenue collection system from the Mughals in which the heaviest proportion of the tax burden fell on the cultivators, with one-third of the production reserved for imperial entitlement; this pre-colonial system became the Company revenue policy&#x27;s baseline. However, there was vast variation across India in the methods by which the revenues were collected; with this complication in mind, a Committee of Circuit toured the districts of expanded Bengal Presidency in order to make a five-year settlement, consisting of five-yearly inspections and temporary tax farming. In their overall approach to revenue policy, Company officials were guided by two goals: first, preserving as much as possible the balance of rights and obligations that were traditionally claimed by the farmers who cultivated the land and the various intermediaries who collected tax on the state&#x27;s behalf and who reserved a cut for themselves; and second, identifying those sectors of the rural economy that would maximise both revenue and security. Although their first revenue settlement turned out to be essentially the same as the more informal pre-existing Mughal one, the company had created a foundation for the growth of both information and bureaucracy.

In 1793, the new Governor-General, Lord Cornwallis, promulgated the permanent settlement of land revenues in the presidency, the first socio-economic regulation in colonial India. By the terms of the settlement rajas and taluqdars were recognised as zamindars and they were asked to collect the rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the company. It was named &quot;permanent&quot; because it fixed the land tax in perpetuity in return for landed property rights for zamindars; it simultaneously defined the nature of land ownership in the presidency, and gave individuals and families separate property rights in occupied land. Since the revenue was fixed in perpetuity, it was fixed at a high level, which in Bengal amounted to £3 million at 1789–90 prices. According to the Permanent Settlement if the zamindars failed to pay the revenue on time, the zamindari right would be taken from them. According to one estimate, this was 20% higher than the revenue demand before 1757. Over the next century, partly as a result of land surveys, court rulings, and property sales, the change was given practical dimension. An influence on the development of this revenue policy were the economic theories then current, which regarded agriculture as the engine of economic development, and consequently stressed the fixing of revenue demands in order to encourage growth. The expectation behind the permanent settlement was that knowledge of a fixed government demand would encourage the zamindars to increase both their average outcrop and the land under cultivation, since they would be able to retain the profits from the increased output; in addition, it was envisaged that land itself would become a marketable form of property that could be purchased, sold, or mortgaged. A feature of this economic rationale was the additional expectation that the zamindars, recognising their own best interest, would not make unreasonable demands on the peasantry.

However, these expectations were not realised in practice, and in many regions of Bengal, the peasants bore the brunt of the increased demand, there being little protection for their traditional rights in the new legislation. Forced labour of the peasants by the zamindars became more prevalent as cash crops were cultivated to meet the Company revenue demands. Although commercialised cultivation was not new to the region, it had now penetrated deeper into village society and made it more vulnerable to market forces. The zamindars themselves were often unable to meet the increased demands that the company had placed on them; consequently, many defaulted, and by one estimate, up to one-third of their lands were auctioned during the first two decades following the permanent settlement. The new owners were often Brahmin and Kayastha employees of the Company who had a good grasp of the new system, and, in many cases, some had prospered under it.

Since the zamindars were never able to undertake costly improvements to the land envisaged under the Permanent Settlement, some of which required the removal of the existing farmers, they soon became rentiers who lived off the rent from their tenant farmers. In many areas, especially northern Bengal, they had to increasingly share the revenue with intermediate tenure holders, called &quot;jotedars&quot;, who supervised farming in the villages. Consequently, unlike the contemporaneous Enclosure movement in Britain, agriculture in Bengal remained the province of the subsistence farming of innumerable small paddy fields.

The zamindari system was one of two principal revenue settlements undertaken by the Company in India. In southern India, Thomas Munro, who would later become Governor of Madras, promoted the &quot;ryotwari&quot; system or the Munro system, in which the government settled land-revenue directly with the peasant farmers, or &quot;ryots&quot;. It was first tried in small scale by Captain Alexander Read in the areas that were taken over from the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently, developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over South India. This was, in part, a consequence of the turmoil of the Anglo-Mysore Wars, which had prevented the emergence of a class of large landowners; in addition, Munro and others felt that &quot;ryotwari&quot; was closer to traditional practice in the region and ideologically more progressive, allowing the benefits of Company rule to reach the lowest levels of rural society. At the heart of the &quot;ryotwari&quot; system was a particular theory of economic rent—and based on David Ricardo&#x27;s Law of Rent—promoted by utilitarian James Mill who formulated the Indian revenue policy between 1819 and 1830. &quot;He believed that the government was the ultimate lord of the soil and should not renounce its right to &#x27;rent&#x27;, i.e. the profit left over on richer soil when wages and other working expenses had been settled.&quot; Another keystone of the new system of temporary settlements was the classification of agricultural fields according to soil type and produce, with average rent rates fixed for the period of the settlement. According to Mill, taxation of land rent would promote efficient agriculture and simultaneously prevent the emergence of a &quot;parasitic landlord class&quot;. Mill advocated &quot;ryotwari&quot; settlements which consisted of government measurement and assessment of each plot (valid for 20 or 30 years) and subsequent taxation which was dependent on the fertility of the soil. The taxed amount was nine-tenths of the &quot;rent&quot; in the early 19th century and gradually fell afterwards. However, in spite of the appeal of the &quot;ryotwari&quot; system&#x27;s abstract principles, class hierarchies in southern Indian villages had not entirely disappeared—for example village headmen continued to hold sway—and peasant cultivators sometimes came to experience revenue demands they could not meet. In the 1850s, a scandal erupted when it was discovered that some Indian revenue agents of the company were using torture to meet the company&#x27;s revenue demands.

Land revenue settlements constituted a major administrative activity of the various governments in India under Company rule. In all areas other than the Bengal Presidency, land settlement work involved a continually repetitive process of surveying and measuring plots, assessing their quality, and recording landed rights, and constituted a large proportion of the work of Indian Civil Service officers working for the government. After the Company lost its trading rights, it became the single most important source of government revenue, roughly half of overall revenue in the middle of the 19th century; even so, between the years 1814 and 1859, the government of India ran debts in 33 years. With expanded dominion, even during non-deficit years, there was just enough money to pay the salaries of a threadbare administration, a skeleton police force, and the army.
==Army and civil service==

In 1772, when Hastings became the first Governor-General one of his first undertakings was the rapid expansion of the Presidency&#x27;s army. Since the available soldiers, or &quot;Sepoys&quot;, from Bengal—many of whom had fought against the British in the Battle of Plasseywere now suspect in British eyes, Hastings recruited farther west from the &quot;major breeding ground&quot; of India&#x27;s infantry in eastern Awadh and the lands around Banaras including Bihar. The high caste rural Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins of this region, known as &quot;Purbiyas&quot; (Hindi, lit. &quot;easterners&quot;), had been recruited by Mughal Empire armies for two hundred years; the East India Company continued this practice for the next 75 years, with these soldiers comprising up to eighty per cent of the Bengal army. British in Malabar also converted Thiyyar army, called as Thiyya pattalam into a special regiment centered at Thalassery called as The Thiyyar Regiment in 1904. However, in order to avoid any friction within the ranks, the company also took pains to adapt its military practices to their religious requirements. Consequently, these soldiers dined in separate facilities; in addition, overseas service, considered polluting to their caste, was not required of them, and the army soon came to recognise Hindu festivals officially. &quot;This encouragement of high caste ritual status, however, left the government vulnerable to protest, even mutiny, whenever the sepoys detected infringement of their prerogatives.&quot;

The Bengal Army was used in military campaigns in other parts of India and abroad: to provide crucial support to a weak Madras army in the Third Anglo-Mysore War in 1791, and also in Java and Ceylon. In contrast to the soldiers in the armies of Indian rulers, the Bengal sepoys not only received high pay, but also received it reliably, thanks in great measure to the company&#x27;s access to the vast land-revenue reserves of Bengal. Soon, bolstered both by the new musket technology and naval support, the Bengal army came to be widely well-regarded. The well-disciplined sepoys attired in red-coats and their British officers began to arouse &quot;a kind of awe in their adversaries. In Maharashtra and in Java, the sepoys were regarded as the embodiment of demonic forces, sometimes of antique warrior heroes. Indian rulers adopted red serge jackets for their own forces and retainers as if to capture their magical qualities.&quot;

In 1796, under pressure from the company&#x27;s board of directors in London, the Indian troops were re-organised and reduced during the tenure of John Shore as Governor-General. However, the closing years of the 18th century saw, with Wellesley&#x27;s campaigns, a new increase in the army strength. Thus in 1806, at the time of the Vellore Mutiny, the combined strength of the three presidencies&#x27; armies stood at 154,500, making them one of the largest standing armies in the world.

As the East India Company expanded its territories, it added irregular &quot;local corps&quot;, which were not as well trained as the army. In 1846, after the Second Anglo-Sikh War, a frontier brigade was raised in the Cis-Sutlej Hill States mainly for police work; in addition, in 1849, the &quot;Punjab Irregular Force&quot; was added on the frontier. Two years later, this force consisted of &quot;3 light field batteries, 5 regiments of cavalry, and 5 of infantry&quot;. The following year, &quot;a garrison company was added, ... a sixth infantry regiment (formed from the Sind Camel Corps) in 1853, and one mountain battery in 1856&quot;. Similarly, a local force was raised after the annexation of Nagpur in 1854, and the &quot;Oudh Irregular Force&quot; was added after Oudh was annexed in 1856. Earlier, as a result of the treaty of 1800, the Nizam of Hyderabad had begun to maintain a contingent force of 9,000 horse and 6,000-foot which was commanded by Company officers; in 1853, after a new treaty was negotiated, this force was assigned to Berar and stopped being a part of the Nizam&#x27;s army.
In the Indian rebellion of 1857 almost the entire Bengal army, both regular and irregular, revolted. It has been suggested that after the annexation of Oudh by the East India Company in 1856, many sepoys were disquieted both from losing their perquisites, as landed gentry, in the Oudh courts and from the anticipation of any increased land-revenue payments that the annexation might augur. With British victories in wars or with annexation, as the extent of British jurisdiction expanded, the soldiers were now not only expected to serve in less familiar regions (such as in Burma in the Anglo-Burmese Wars in 1856), but also make do without the &quot;foreign service&quot;, remuneration that had previously been their due, and this caused resentment in the ranks. The Bombay and Madras armies, and the Hyderabad contingent, however, remained loyal. The Punjab Irregular Force not only did not revolt, it played an active role in suppressing the mutiny. The rebellion led to a complete re-organisation of the Indian army in 1858 in the new British Raj.

===Civil service===
The reforms initiated after 1784 were designed to create an elite civil service where very talented young Britons would spend their entire careers. Advanced training was promoted especially at the East India Company College (until 1853). Haileybury emphasised the Anglican religion and morality and trained students in the classical Indian languages. Many students held to Whiggish, evangelical, and Utilitarian convictions of their duty to represent their nation and to modernise India. At most there were about 600 of these men who managed the Raj&#x27;s customs service, taxes, justice system, and its general administration. The company&#x27;s original policy was one of &quot;Orientalism&quot;, that is of adjusting to the way of life and customs of the Indian people and not trying to reform them. That changed after 1813, as the forces of reform in the home country, especially evangelical religion, Whiggish political outlook, and Utilitarian philosophy worked together to make the company an agent of Anglicization and modernisation. Christian missionaries became active, but made few converts. The Raj set out to outlaw sati (widow-burning) and thuggee (ritual banditry) and upgrade the status of women. Schools would be established in which they would teach the English language. The 1830s and 1840s, however, were not times of prosperity: After its heavy spending on the military, the company had little money to engage in large-scale public works projects or modernisation programs.
==Trade==
After gaining the right to collect revenue in Bengal in 1765, the Company largely ceased importing gold and silver, which it had hitherto used to pay for goods shipped back to Britain.

In addition, as under Mughal Empire rule, land revenue collected in the Bengal Presidency helped finance the company&#x27;s wars in other parts of India. Consequently, in the period 1760–1800, Bengal&#x27;s money supply was greatly diminished; furthermore, the closing of some local mints and close supervision of the rest, the fixing of exchange rates, and the standardisation of coinage, paradoxically, added to the economic downturn. During the period, 1780–1860, India changed from being an exporter of processed goods for which it received payment in bullion, to being an exporter of raw materials and a buyer of manufactured goods. More specifically, in the 1750s, mostly fine cotton and silk was exported from India to markets in Europe, Asia, and Africa; by the second quarter of the 19th century, raw materials, which chiefly consisted of raw cotton, opium, and indigo, accounted for most of India&#x27;s exports. Also, from the late 18th century British cotton mill industry began to lobby the government to both tax Indian imports and allow them access to markets in India. Starting in the 1830s, British textiles began to appear in—and soon to inundate—the Indian markets, with the value of the textile imports growing from £5.2 million 1850 to £18.4 million in 1896. The American Civil War too would have a major impact on India&#x27;s cotton economy: with the outbreak of the war, American cotton was no longer available to British manufacturers; consequently, demand for Indian cotton soared, and the prices soon quadrupled. This led many farmers in India to switch to cultivating cotton as a quick cash crop; however, with the end of the war in 1865, the demand plummeted again, creating another downturn in the agricultural economy.

At this time, the East India Company&#x27;s trade with China began to grow as well. In the early 19th century, demand for Chinese tea had greatly increased in Britain; since the money supply in India was restricted and the company was indisposed to shipping bullion from Britain, it decided upon opium, which had a large underground market in Qing China and which was grown in many parts of India, as the most profitable form of payment. However, since the Chinese authorities had banned the importation and consumption of opium, the Company engaged them in the First Opium War, and at its conclusion, under the Treaty of Nanjing, gained access to five Chinese ports, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, and Ningbo; in addition, Hong Kong was ceded to the British Crown. Towards the end of the second quarter of the 19th century, opium export constituted 40% of India&#x27;s exports.

Another major, though erratic, export item was indigo dye, which was extracted from natural indigo, and which came to be grown in Bengal and northern Bihar. In 1788, the East India Company offered advances to ten British planters to grow indigo; however, since the new (landed) property rights defined in the Permanent Settlement, did not allow them, as Europeans, to buy agricultural land, they had to in turn offer cash advances to local peasants, and sometimes coerce them, to grow the crop. In early 19th century Europe, blue clothing was favoured as a fashion, and blue uniforms were common in the military; consequently, the demand for the dye was high. The European demand for the dye, however, proved to be unstable, and both creditors and cultivators bore the risk of the market crashes in 1827 and 1847. The peasant discontent in Bengal eventually led to the &quot;Indigo rebellion&quot; in 1859–60 and to the end of indigo production there. In Bihar, however, indigo production continued well into the 20th century; a centre of indigo production there, Champaran district, became an early testing ground, in 1917, for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi&#x27;s strategy of non-violent resistance against the British Raj.
==Justice system==

Until the British gained control of Bengal in later part of 18th century, the system of justice there was presided over by the Nawab of Bengal himself, who, as the chief law officer, &quot;Nawāb Nāzim&quot;, attended to cases qualifying for capital punishment in his headquarters, Murshidabad. His deputy, the &quot;Naib Nāzim&quot;, attended to the slightly less important cases. The ordinary lawsuits belonged to the jurisdiction of a hierarchy of court officials consisting of &quot;faujdārs&quot;, &quot;muhtasils&quot;, and &quot;kotwāls&quot;. In the rural areas, or the &quot;Mofussil&quot;, the &quot;zamindars&quot;—the rural overlords with the hereditary right to collect rent from peasant farmers—also had the power to administer justice. This they did with little routine oversight, being required to report only their judgments in capital punishment cases to the &quot;Nawāb&quot;.

By the mid-18th century, the East India Company had completed a century and a half presence in India as a trading company, and had a burgeoning presence in the three &quot;presidency&quot; towns of Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta. During this time the successive Royal Charters had gradually given the East India Company more power to administer justice in these towns. In the charter granted by Charles II in 1683, the company was given the power to establish &quot;courts of judicature&quot; in locations of its choice, each court consisting of a lawyer and two merchants. This right was renewed in the subsequent charters granted by James II and William III in 1686 and 1698 respectively. In 1726, however, the Court of Directors of the Company felt that more customary justice was necessary for European residents in the presidency towns, and petitioned the King to establish &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Courts&quot;. The petition was approved and Mayor&#x27;s courts, each consisting of a Mayor and nine aldermen, and each having the jurisdiction in lawsuits &quot;between&quot; Europeans, were created in Fort William (Calcutta), Madras, and Bombay. Judgments handed down by a Mayor&#x27;s Court could be disputed with an appeal to the respective Presidency government and, when the amount disputed was greater than Rs. 4,000, with a further appeal to the King-in-Council. In 1753, the Mayor&#x27;s courts were renewed under a revised letters patent; in addition, Courts of Requests for lawsuits involving amounts less than Rs. 20 were introduced. Both types of courts were regulated by the Court of Directors of the East India Company.

After its victory in the Battle of Buxar, the Company obtained in 1765 the &quot;Diwāni&quot; of Bengal, the right not only to collect revenue, but also to administer civil justice in Bengal. The administration of criminal justice, the &quot;Nizāmat&quot; or &quot;Faujdāri&quot;, however, remained with the &quot;Nawāb&quot;, and for criminal cases the prevailing Islamic law remained in place. However, the company&#x27;s new duties associated with the &quot;Diwāni&quot; were leased out to the Indian officials who had formerly performed them. This makeshift arrangement continued—with much accompanying disarray—until 1771, when the Court of Directors of the Company decided to obtain for the company the jurisdiction of both criminal and civil cases.

Soon afterwards Warren Hastings arrived in Calcutta as the first Governor-General of the company&#x27;s Indian dominions and resolved to overhaul the company&#x27;s organisation and in particular its judicial affairs. In the interior, or &quot;Mofussil&quot;, &quot;diwāni adālats&quot;, or a civil courts of first instance, were constituted in each district; these courts were presided over by European &quot;Zilā&quot; judges employed by the company, who were assisted in the interpretation of customary Indian law by Hindu &quot;pandits&quot; and Muslim &quot;qazis&quot;. For small claims, however, Registrars and Indian commissioners, known as &quot;Sadr Amīns&quot; and &quot;Munsifs&quot;, were appointed. These in their turn were supervised by provincial civil courts of appeal constituted for such purpose, each consisting of four British judges. All these were under the authority of the &quot;Sadr Diwāni Adālat&quot;, or the Chief Civil Court of Appeals, consisting of the Governor of the Presidency and his Council, assisted by Indian officers.

Similarly for criminal cases, Mofussil &quot;nizāmat adālats&quot;, or Provincial courts of criminal judicature, were created in the interior; these again consisted of Indian court officers (&quot;pandits&quot; and &quot;qazis&quot;), who were supervised by officials of the company. Also constituted were courts of circuit with appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases, which were usually presided over by the judges of the civil appellate courts. All these too were under a &quot;Sadr Nizāmat Adālat&quot; or a Chief Court of Criminal Appeal.

Around this time the business affairs of the East India Company began to draw increased scrutiny in the House of Commons. After receiving a report by a committee, which condemned the Mayor&#x27;s Courts, the Crown issued a charter for a new judicial system in the Bengal Presidency. The British Parliament consequently enacted the Regulating Act 1773 under which the King-in-Council created a Supreme Court in the &quot;Presidency town&quot;, i.e. Fort William. The tribunal consisted of one Chief Justice and three puisne judges; all four judges were to be chosen from barristers. The Supreme Court supplanted the Mayor&#x27;s Court; however, it left the Court of Requests in place. Under the charter, the Supreme Court, moreover, had the authority to exercise all types of jurisdiction in the region of Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha, with the only caveat that in situations where the disputed amount was in excess of Rs. 4,000, their judgment could be appealed to the Privy Council. Both the Act and the charter said nothing about the relation between the judiciary (Supreme Court) and the executive branch (Governor-General); equally, they were silent on the &quot;Adālats&quot; (both &quot;Diwāni&quot; and &quot;Nizāmat&quot;) created by Warren Hastings just the year before. In the new Supreme Court, the civil and criminal cases alike were interpreted and prosecuted accorded to English law; in the &quot;Sadr Adālats&quot;, however, the judges and law-officers had no knowledge of English law, and were required only, by the Governor-General&#x27;s order, &quot;to proceed according to equity, justice, and good conscience, unless Hindu or Muhammadan law was in point, or some Regulation expressly applied&quot;.

There was a good likelihood, therefore, that the Supreme Court and the &quot;Sadr Adālats&quot; would act in opposition to each other and, predictably, many disputes resulted. Hastings&#x27; premature attempt to appoint the Chief Justice, Sir Elijah Impey, an old schoolmate from Winchester, to the bench of the &quot;Sadr Diwāni Adālat&quot;, only complicated the situation further. The appointment had to be annulled in 1781 by a parliamentary intervention with the enactment of the Declaration Act 1781. The act exempted the Executive Branch from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. It recognised the independent existence of the &quot;Sadr Adālats&quot; and all subsidiary courts of the company. Furthermore, it headed off future legal turf wars by prohibiting the Supreme Court any jurisdiction in matters of revenue (&quot;Diwāni&quot;) or Regulations of the Government enacted by the British Parliament. This state of affairs continued until 1797, when a new act of Parliament extended the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to the province of Benares (which had since been added to the company&#x27;s dominions) and &quot;all places for the time being included in Bengal&quot;. With the creation of the Ceded and Conquered Provinces in 1805, the jurisdiction would extend as far west as Delhi.

In the other two presidencies, Madras and Bombay, a similar course of legal changes unfolded; there, however, the Mayor&#x27;s Courts were first strengthened to Recorder&#x27;s Courts by adding a legal president to the bench. The Supreme Courts in Madras and Bombay were finally established in 1801 and 1823, respectively. Madras Presidency was also unusual in being the first to rely on village headmen and &quot;panchāyats&quot; for cases involving small claims. This judicial system in the three presidencies was to survive the company&#x27;s rule, the next major change coming only in 1861.
==Education==

Education of Indians had become a topic of interest among East India Company officials from the outset of the company&#x27;s rule in Bengal. In the last two decades of the 18th century and the first decade of the nineteenth, Company officials pursued a policy of conciliation towards the native culture of its new dominion, especially in relation to education policy. During the 19th century, the Indian literacy rates were rumoured to be less than half of post independence levels which were 18.33% in 1951. The policy was pursued in the aid of three goals: &quot;to sponsor Indians in their own culture, to advance knowledge of India, and to employ that knowledge in government&quot;.

The first goal was supported by some administrators, such as Warren Hastings, who envisaged the company as the successor of a great Empire, and saw the support of vernacular learning as only befitting that role. In 1781, Hastings founded the &quot;Madrasa &#x27;Aliya&quot;, an institution in Calcutta for the study of Arabic and Persian languages, and Islamic law. A few decades later a related perspective appeared among the governed population, one that was expressed by the conservative Bengali reformer Radhakanta Deb as the &quot;duty of the Rulers of Countries to preserve and Customs and the religions of their subjects&quot;.

The second goal was motivated by the concerns among some Company officials about being seen as foreign rulers. They argued that the company should try to win over its subjects by outdoing the region&#x27;s previous rulers in the support of indigenous learning. Guided by this belief, the Benares Sanskrit College was founded in Varanasi in 1791 during the administration of Lord Cornwallis. The promotion of knowledge of Asia had attracted scholars as well to the company&#x27;s service. Earlier, in 1784, the Asiatick Society had been founded in Calcutta by William Jones, a puisne judge in the newly established Supreme Court of Bengal. Soon, Jones was to advance his famous thesis on the common origin of Indo-European languages.

The third related goal grew out of the philosophy then current among some Company officials that they would themselves become better administrators if they were better versed in the languages and cultures of India. It led in 1800 to the founding of the College of Fort William, in Calcutta by Lord Wellesley, the then Governor-General. The college was later to play an important role both in the development of modern Indian languages and in the Bengal Renaissance. Advocates of these related goals were termed, &quot;Orientalists&quot;. The Orientalist group was led by Horace Hayman Wilson. Many leading Company officials, such as Thomas Munro and Montstuart Elphinstone, were influenced by the Orientalist ethos and felt that the company&#x27;s government in India should be responsive to Indian expectations. The Orientalist ethos would prevail in education policy well into the 1820s, and was reflected in the founding of the Poona Sanskrit College in Pune in 1821 and the Calcutta Sanskrit College in 1824.

The Orientalists were, however, soon opposed by advocates of an approach that has been termed &quot;Anglicist&quot;. The Anglicists supported instruction in the English language in order to impart to Indians what they considered modern Western knowledge. Prominent among them were evangelicals who, after 1813—when the company&#x27;s territories were opened to Christian missionaries—were interested in spreading Christian belief; they also believed in using theology to promote liberal social reform, such as the abolition of slavery. Among them was Charles Grant, the Chairman of the East India Company. Grant supported state-sponsored education in India 20 years before a similar system was set up in Britain. Among Grant&#x27;s close evangelical friends were William Wilberforce, a prominent abolitionist and member of the British Parliament, and Sir John Shore, the Governor-General of India from 1793 to 1797. During this period, many Scottish Presbyterian missionaries also supported the British rulers in their efforts to spread English education and established many reputed colleges like Scottish Church College (1830), Wilson College (1832), Madras Christian College (1837), and Elphinstone College (1856).

However, the Anglicists also included utilitarians, led by James Mill, who had begun to play an important role in fashioning Company policy. The utilitarians believed in the moral worth of an education that aided the good of society and promoted instruction in &quot;useful knowledge&quot;. Such &quot;useful&quot; instruction to Indians had the added consequence of making them more suitable for the company&#x27;s burgeoning bureaucracy. By the early 1830s, the Anglicists had the upper hand in devising education policy in India. Many utilitarian ideas were employed in Thomas Babbington Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;Minute on Indian Education&quot; of 1835. The &quot;Minute&quot;, which later aroused great controversy, was to influence education policy in India well into the next century.

Since English was increasingly being employed as the language of instruction, Persian was abolished as the official language of the company&#x27;s administration and courts by 1837. However, bilingual educations was proving to be popular as well, and some institutions such as the Poona Sanskrit College commenced teaching both Sanskrit and English. Charles Grant&#x27;s son, Sir Robert Grant, who in 1834 was appointed Governor of the Bombay Presidency, played an influential role in the planning of the first medical college in Bombay, which after his unexpected death was named Grant Medical College when it was established in 1845. During 1852–1853 some citizens of Bombay sent petitions to the British Parliament in support of both establishing and adequately funding university education in India. The petitions resulted in the Education Dispatch of 1854 sent by Sir Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the East India Company, the chief official on Indian affairs in the British government, to Lord Dalhousie, the then Governor-General of India. The dispatch outlined a broad plan of state-sponsored education for India, which included:

# Establishing a Department of Public Instruction in each presidency or province of British India.
# Establishing universities modelled on the University of London (as primarily examining institutions for students studying in affiliated colleges) in each of the &quot;Presidency towns&quot; (i.e. Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta)
# Establishing teachers-training schools for all levels of instruction
# Maintaining existing Government colleges and high-schools and increasing their number when necessary.
# Vastly increasing vernacular schools for elementary education in villages.
# Introducing a system of grants-in-aid for private schools.

The Department of Public Instruction was in place by 1855. In January 1857, the University of Calcutta was established, followed by the University of Bombay in June 1857, and the University of Madras in September 1857. The University of Bombay, for example, consisted of three affiliated institutions: the Elphinstone Institution, the Grant Medical College, and the Poona Sanskrit College. The company&#x27;s administration also founded high-schools &quot;en masse&quot; in the different provinces and presidencies, and the policy was continued during Crown rule which commenced in 1858. By 1861, 230,000 students were attending public educational institutions in the four provinces (the three Presidencies and North-Western Provinces), of whom 200,000 were in primary schools. Over 5,000 primary schools and 142 secondary schools had been established in these provinces. Earlier, during the Indian rebellion of 1857, some civilian leaders, such as Khan Bhadur Khan of Bareilly, had stressed the threat posed to the populace&#x27;s religions by the new education programmes begun by the company; however, historical statistics have shown that this was not generally the case. For example, in Etawah district in the then North-Western Provinces (present-day Uttar Pradesh), where during the period 1855–1857, nearly 200 primary, middle-, and high-schools had been opened by the company and tax levied on the population, relative calm prevailed and the schools remained open during the rebellion.

==Social reform==
In the first half of the 19th century, the British legislated reforms against what they considered were iniquitous Indian practices. In most cases, the legislation alone was unable to change Indian society sufficiently for it to absorb both the ideal and the ethic underpinning the reform. For example, upper-caste Hindu society in the Indo-Aryan speaking regions of India had long looked askance at the remarriage of widows in order to protect both what it considered was family honour and family property. Even adolescent widows were expected to live a life of austerity and denial. The Hindu Widows&#x27; Remarriage Act, 1856, enacted in the waning years of Company rule, provided legal safeguards against loss of certain forms of inheritance for a remarrying Hindu widow, though not of the inheritance due her from her deceased husband. However, very few widows actually remarried. Some Indian reformers, such as Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, even offered money to men who would take widows as brides, but these men often deserted their new wives.

==Post and telegraph==
===Postal services===

Before 1837, the East India Company&#x27;s dominions in India had no universal public postal service, one that was shared by all regions. Although courier services did exist, connecting the more important towns with their respective seats of provincial government (i.e. the &quot;Presidency towns&quot; of Fort William (Calcutta), Fort St. George (Madras), and Bombay), private individuals were, upon payment, only sparingly allowed their use. That situation changed in 1837, when, by Act XVII of that year, a public post, run by the company&#x27;s Government, was established in the company&#x27;s territory in India. Post offices were established in the principal towns and postmasters appointed. The postmasters of the Presidency towns oversaw a few provincial post offices in addition to being responsible for the main postal services between the provinces. By contrast, the District collectors (originally, collectors of land-tax) directed the District post offices, including their local postal services. Postal services required payment in cash, to be made in advance, with the amount charged usually varying with weight and distance. For example, the charge of sending a letter from Calcutta to Bombay was one rupee; however, that from Calcutta to Agra was 12 annas (or three-quarter of a rupee) for each tola (three-eighths of an ounce).

After the recommendations of the commission appointed in 1850 to evaluate the Indian postal system were received, Act XVII of 1837 was superseded by the Indian Postal Act of 1854. Under its provisions, the entire postal department was headed by a &quot;Director-General&quot;, and the duties of a &quot;Postmaster-General&quot; were set apart from those of a Presidency Postmaster; the former administered the postal system of the larger provinces (such as the Bombay Presidency or the North-Western Provinces), whereas the latter attended to the less important Provinces (such as Ajmer-Merwara and the major Political Agencies such as Rajputana). Postage stamps were introduced at this time and the postal rates fixed by weight, dependent no longer also on the distance travelled in the delivery. The lowest inland letter rate was half anna for tola, followed by one anna for tola, and 2 annas for a tola, a great reduction from the rates of 17 years before. The Indian Post Office delivered letters, newspapers, postcards, book packets, and parcels. These deliveries grew steadily in number; by 1861 (three years after the end of Company rule), a total of 889 post offices had been opened, and almost 43 million letters and over four and a half million newspapers were being delivered annually.
===Telegraphy===
Before the advent of electric telegraphy, the word &quot;telegraph&quot; had been used for semaphore signalling. During the period 1820–1830, the East India Company&#x27;s Government in India seriously considered constructing signalling towers (&quot;telegraph&quot; towers), each a hundred feet high and separated from the next by eight miles, along the entire distance from Calcutta to Bombay. Although such towers were built in Bengal and Bihar, the India-wide semaphore network never took off. By mid-century, electric telegraphy had become viable, and hand signalling obsolete.

W. B. O&#x27;Shaughnessy, a professor of chemistry in the Calcutta Medical College, received permission in 1851 to conduct a trial run for a telegraph service from Calcutta to Diamond Harbour along the river Hooghly. Four telegraph offices, mainly for shipping-related business, were also opened along the river that year. The telegraph receiver used in the trial was a galvanoscope of O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s design and manufactured in India. When the experiment was deemed to be a success a year later, the Governor-General of India, Lord Dalhousie, sought permission from the Court of Directors of the company for the construction of telegraph lines from &quot;Calcutta to Agra, Agra to Bombay, Agra to Peshawar, and Bombay to Madras, extending in all over 3,050 miles and including forty-one offices&quot;. The permission was soon granted; by February 1855 all the proposed telegraph lines had been constructed and were being used to send paid messages. O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s instrument was used all over India until early 1857, when it was supplanted by the Morse instrument. By 1857, the telegraph network had expanded to 4,555 miles of lines and sixty two offices, and had reached as far as the hill station of Ootacamund in the Nilgiri Hills and the port of Calicut on the southwest coast of India. During the Indian rebellion of 1857, more than seven hundred miles of telegraph lines were destroyed by the rebel forces, mainly in the North-Western Provinces. The East India Company was nevertheless able to use the remaining intact lines to warn many outposts of impending disturbances. The political value of the new technology was, thus, driven home to the company, and, in the following year, not only were the destroyed lines rebuilt, but the network was expanded further by 2,000 miles.

O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s experimental set-up of 1851–52 consisted of both overhead and underground lines; the latter included underwater ones that crossed two rivers, the Hooghly and the Haldi. The overhead line was constructed by welding uninsulated iron rods, feet long and 3/8 inch wide, end to end. These lines, which weighed 1,250 pounds per mile, were held aloft by fifteen-foot lengths of bamboo, planted into the ground at equal intervals—200 to the mile—and covered with a layer each of coal tar and pitch for insulation. The underwater cables had been manufactured in England and consisted of copper wire covered with gutta-percha. Furthermore, in order to protect the cables from dragging ship anchors, the cables were attached to the links of a chain cable. An underwater cable of length 2,070 yards was laid across the Hooghly river at Diamond Harbour, and another, 1,400 yards long, was laid across the Haldi at Kedgeree.

Work on the long lines from Calcutta to Peshawar (through Agra), Agra to Bombay, and Bombay to Madras began in 1853. The conducting material chosen for these lines was now lighter, and the support stronger. The wood used for the support consisted of teak, sal, fir, ironwood, or blackwood (&quot;Terminalia elata&quot;), and was either fashioned into whole posts, or used in attachments to iron &quot;screw-piles&quot; or masonry columns. Some sections had uniformly strong support; one such was the 322-mile Bombay-Madras line, which was supported by granite obelisks sixteen feet high. Other sections had less secure support, consisting, in some cases, of sections of toddy palm, insulated with pieces of sal wood fastened to their tops. Some of the conducting wires or rods were insulated, the insulating material being manufactured in either India or England; other stretches of wire remained uninsulated. By 1856, iron tubes had begun to be employed to provide support, and would see increased use in the second half of the 19th century all over India.

The first Telegraph Act for India was Parliament&#x27;s Act XXXIV of 1854. When the public telegramme service was first set up in 1855, the charge was fixed at one rupee for every sixteen words (including the address) for every 400 miles of transmission. The charges were doubled for telegrammes sent between 6PM and 6AM. These rates would remain fixed until 1882. In the year 1860–61, two years after the end of Company rule, India had 11,093 miles of telegraph lines and 145 telegraph offices. That year telegrams totalling Rs. 500,000 in value were sent by the public, the working expense of the &quot;Indian Telegraph Department&quot; was Rs. 1.4 million, and the capital expenditure until the end of the year totalled Rs. 6.5 million.

==Railways==

The first inter-city railway service in England, the Stockton and Darlington Railway, had been established in 1825; in the following decade other inter-city railways were rapidly constructed between cities in England. In 1845, the Court of Directors of the East India Company, forwarded to the Governor-General of India, Lord Dalhousie, a number of applications they had received from private contractors in England for the construction of a wide-ranging railway network in India, and requested a feasibility report. They added that, in their view, the enterprise would be profitable only if large sums of money could be raised for the construction. The Court was concerned that in addition to the usual difficulties encountered in the construction of this new form of transportation, India might present some unique problems, among which they counted floods, tropical storms in coastal areas, damage by &quot;insects and luxuriant tropical vegetation&quot;, and the difficulty of finding qualified technicians at a reasonable cost. It was suggested, therefore, that three experimental lines be constructed and their performance evaluated.

Contracts were awarded in 1849 to the East Indian Railway Company to construct a 120-mile railway from Howrah-Calcutta to Raniganj; to the Great Indian Peninsular Railway Company for a service from Bombay to Kalyan, thirty miles away; and to the &quot;Madras Railway Company&quot; for a line from Madras city to Arkonam, a distance of some thirty nine miles. Although construction began first, in 1849, on the East Indian Railways line, with an outlay of £1 million, it was the first-leg of the Bombay-Kalyan line—a 21-mile stretch from Bombay to Thane—that, in 1853, was the first to be completed (see picture below).
The feasibility of a train network in India was comprehensively discussed by Lord Dalhousie in his &quot;Railway minute of 1853&quot;. The Governor-General vigorously advocated the quick and widespread introduction of railways in India, pointing to their political, social, and economic advantages. He recommended that a network of &quot;trunk lines&quot; be first constructed connecting the inland regions of each presidency with its chief port as well as each presidency with several others. His recommended trunk lines included the following ones: (i) from Calcutta, in the Bengal Presidency, on the eastern coast to Lahore in the north-western region of the Punjab, annexed just three years before; (ii) from Agra in north-central India (in, what was still being called North-Western Provinces) to Bombay city on the western coast; (iii) from Bombay to Madras city on the southeastern coast; and (iv) from Madras to the southwestern Malabar coast (see map above). The proposal was soon accepted by the Court of Directors.

During this time work had been proceeding on the experimental lines as well. The first leg of the East Indian Railway line, a broad gauge railway, from Howrah to Pandua, was opened in 1854 (see picture of locomotive below), and the entire line up to Raniganj would become functional by the time of the Indian rebellion of 1857. The Great Indian Peninsular Railway was permitted to extend its experimental line to Poona. This extension required planning for the steep rise in the &quot;Bor Ghat&quot; valley in the Western Ghats, a section miles long with an ascent of 1,831 feet. Construction began in 1856 and was completed in 1863, and, in the end, the line required a total of twenty five tunnels and fifteen miles of gradients (inclines) of 1 in 50 or steeper, the most extreme being the &quot;Bor Ghat Incline&quot;, a distance of miles at a gradient of 1 in 37 (see picture above).

Each of the three companies (and later five others that were given contracts in 1859) was a joint stock company domiciled in England with its financial capital raised in pounds sterling. Each company was guaranteed a 5 per cent return on its capital outlay and, in addition, a share of half the profits. Although the Government of India had no capital expenditure other than the provision of the underlying land free of charge, it had the onus of continuing to provide the 5 percent return in the event of net loss, and soon all anticipation of profits would fall by the wayside as the outlays would mount.

The technology of railway construction was still new and there was no railway engineering expertise in India; consequently, all engineers had to be brought in from England. These engineers were unfamiliar not only with the language and culture of India, but also with the physical aspect of the land itself and its concomitant engineering requirements. Moreover, never before had such a large and complex construction project been undertaken in India, and no pool of semi-skilled labour was already organised to aid the engineers. The work, therefore, proceeded in fits and starts—many practical trials followed by a final construction that was undertaken with great caution and care—producing an outcome that was later criticised as being &quot;built to a standard which was far in excess of the needs to the time&quot;. The Government of India&#x27;s administrators, moreover, made up in their attention to the fine details of expenditure and management what they lacked in professional expertise. The resulting delays soon led to the appointment of a Committee of the House of Commons in 1857–58 to investigate the matter. However, by the time the Committee concluded that all parties needed to honour the spirit rather than the letter of the contracts, Company rule in India had ended.

Although, railway construction had barely begun in the last years of this rule, its foundations had been laid, and it would proceed apace for much of the next half century. By the turn of the 20th century, India would have over 28,000 miles of railways connecting most interior regions to the ports of Karachi, Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Chittagong, and Rangoon, and together they would constitute the fourth-largest railway network in the world.
==Canals==

The first irrigation works undertaken during East India Company&#x27;s rule were begun in 1817. Consisting chiefly of extensions or reinforcements of previous Indian works, these projects were limited to the plains north of Delhi and to the river deltas of the Madras Presidency. A small dam in the Kaveri river delta, built some 1,500 years before, and known as the &quot;Grand Anicut&quot;, was one such indigenous work in South India. In 1835–36, Sir Arthur Cotton successfully reinforced the dam, and his success prompted more irrigation projects on the river. A little farther north, on the Tungabhadra river, the 16th century Vijayanagara ruler, Krishna Deva Raya, had constructed several weirs; these too would be extended under British administration.

In plains above Delhi, the mid-14th century Sultan of Delhi, Firoz Shah Tughlaq, had constructed the 150-mile long &quot;Western Jamna Canal&quot;. Taking off from the right bank of the Jamna river early in its course, the canal irrigated the Sultan&#x27;s territories in the Hissar region of Eastern Punjab. By the mid-16th century, however, the fine sediment carried by the Himalayan river had gradually choked the canal. Desilted and reopened several decades later by Akbar the Great, the &quot;Western Jamna Canal&quot; was itself tapped by Akbar&#x27;s grandson Shah Jahan, and some of its water was diverted to Delhi. During this time another canal was cut off the river. The 129-mile &quot;Eastern Jamna Canal&quot; or &quot;Doab Canal&quot;, which took off from the left bank of the Jamna, also high in its course, presented a qualitatively different difficulty. Since it was cut through steeply sloped land, its flow became difficult to control, and it was never to function efficiently. With the decline of Mughal Empire power in the 18th century, both canals fell into disrepair and closed. The Western Jamna Canal was repaired by British Army engineers and it reopened in 1820. The Doab Canal was reopened in 1830; its considerable renovation involved raising the embankment by an average height of 9 ft. for some 40 miles.
Farther west in the Punjab region, the 130-mile long &quot;Hasli Canal&quot;, had been constructed by previous rulers. Taking off from the Ravi river and supplying water to the cities of Lahore and Amritsar, this left-bank canal was extended by the British in the &quot;Bari Doab Canal&quot; works during 1850–1857. The Punjab region, moreover, had much rudimentary irrigation by &quot;inundation canals&quot;. Consisting of open cuts on the side of a river and involving no regulation, the inundation canals had been used in both the Punjab and Sindh for many centuries. The energetic administrations of the Sikh and Pathan governors of Mughal West Punjab had ensured that many such canals in Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Muzaffargarh were still working efficiently at the time of the British annexation of the Punjab in 1849–1856 (period of tenure of the Marquess of Dalhousie Governor General).

The first new British work—with no Indian antecedents—was the Ganges Canal built between 1842 and 1854.
Contemplated first by Col. John Russell Colvin in 1836, it did not at first elicit much enthusiasm from its eventual architect Sir Proby Thomas Cautley, who balked at idea of cutting a canal through extensive low-lying land in order to reach the drier upland destination. However, after the Agra famine of 1837–38, during which the East India Company&#x27;s administration spent Rs. 2,300,000 on famine relief, the idea of a canal became more attractive to the company&#x27;s budget-conscious Court of Directors. In 1839, the Governor General of India, Lord Auckland, with the Court&#x27;s assent, granted funds to Cautley for a full survey of the swath of land that underlay and fringed the projected course of the canal. The Court of Directors, moreover, considerably enlarged the scope of the projected canal, which, in consequence of the severity and geographical extent of the famine, they now deemed to be the entire Doab region.

The enthusiasm, however, proved to be short lived. Auckland&#x27;s successor as Governor General, Lord Ellenborough, appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and for the duration of his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, Lord Hardinge, was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse, had seemingly affected Cautely&#x27;s health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in Great Britain and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the North-Western Provinces, with James Thomason as Lt. Governor, and in British India with Lord Dalhousie as Governor-General. Canal construction, under Cautley&#x27;s supervision, now went into full swing. A 350-mile long canal, with another 300 miles of branch lines, eventually stretched between the headworks in Hardwar and—after splitting into two branches at Nanau near Aligarh—the confluence with the Ganges at Cawnpore (now Kanpur) and with the Jumna (now Yamuna) mainstem at Etawah. The Ganges Canal, which required a total capital outlay of £2.15 million, was officially opened in 1854 by Lord Dalhousie. According to historian Ian Stone:

<text>Huntsville International Airport (Carl T. Jones Field) is a public airport and spaceport ten miles southwest of downtown Huntsville, in Madison County, Alabama, United States. The FAA has designated the Huntsville International Airport as a Re-entry site for the Dream Chaser, a spaceplane operated by Sierra Space to make reentries from Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

The airport is part of the Port of Huntsville (along with the International Intermodal Center and Jetplex Industrial Park), and serves the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area. Opened in October 1967 as the Huntsville Jetport, it was the third airport for Huntsville. The airport has 12 gates with restrooms, shops, restaurants, phones and murals depicting aviation and space exploration scenes. The airport also has a 3-star hotel on the premises. The Four Points by Sheraton is located above the ticketing area and lobby, (adjacent to the terminal is a parking garage and to opposite sides are the control tower and a golf course).

The airport&#x27;s west runway, at , is the second longest commercial runway in the southeastern United States, being shorter than the longest runway at Miami International Airport. Huntsville is frequently used as a diversion airport from larger hubs in the Southeast, such as Atlanta, due to its long runways and sophisticated snow removal and de-icing equipment.

The airport&#x27;s &quot;Fly Huntsville&quot; marketing campaign encourages passengers to depart from Huntsville instead of driving to Birmingham or Nashville. An August 2009 report by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics for the first quarter of 2009 revealed that Huntsville passengers paid, on average, was the highest airfares in the United States. However, the airport reported that commercial airline passenger traffic increased 2.3% in January 2010 over the previous year.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 called it a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 612,690 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 572,767 in 2009 and 606,127 in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enplanements 2009/20102&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original airport, Huntsville Flying Field/Mayfair Airport, was south of the city. It had sod runways, no lighting and opened in the early 1930s. By 1934 the airport had four dirt/sod runways, southwest of today&#x27;s intersection of Whitesburg Drive and Bob Wallace Avenue.

A second airport south of downtown opened in 1941 with two paved runways, Runway 18/36 being 4,000&#x27; long. The terminal building was a wooden shack at the northeast end of Runway 5/23; the National Weather Service opened at the municipal airport in 1958. The second airport was near today&#x27;s intersection of Memorial Parkway and Airport Road; traces of runways and terminal facilities can be seen from the air.

Huntsville&#x27;s first scheduled jets were United 727s in 1966. Carl T. Jones Field opened in 1967, west of the city along Highway 20 and County Line Road. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held 15 September 1968 with Dr. Wernher von Braun and Senator John Sparkman in attendance.

On July 10, 2018, the airport announced that Frontier Airlines would begin nonstop service to Denver and Orlando in October with the A320 Family. This marked the resumption of low-cost airline presence at the airport.

== Airport facilities ==
The airport covers 6,000 acres (2,428 ha) at an elevation of 629 feet (192 m). It has two asphalt runways: 18R/36L is 12,600 by 150 feet (3,840 x 46 m) and 18L/36R is 10,001 by 150 feet (3,048 x 46 m). In the year ending June 30, 2023, the airport had 63,603 aircraft operations which averaged about 174 flights per day.

==Airlines and destinations==
Huntsville International Airport is served by four passenger airlines including: American Airlines, Breeze Airways, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines. Huntsville passenger airlines represent the biggest three international airline alliances in the world. Some services are flown by regional affiliates via code sharing agreements.

Huntsville International Airport serves eight cargo airlines including: Cargolux, Latam Cargo, Atlas Air, DSV, Fedex Express, Qatar Airways Cargo, UPS and Kerry Logistics Network.

==Past airline service==
In 1969–80, Huntsville had nonstop or direct flights to Los Angeles, Florida and Texas during the U.S. space program. These flights served the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville.

In June 1967, Eastern Airlines introduced &quot;The Space Corridor&quot; linking Huntsville with St. Louis, Seattle and the NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida. In the June 13, 1967, timetable, Eastern Boeing 727-100s flew to St. Louis and on to Seattle, and nonstop to Orlando continuing to Melbourne, Florida, near the Kennedy Space Center. Eastern flew direct Douglas DC-9-30s to Houston, home of the NASA Johnson Space Center, via New Orleans in the late 1960s. Eastern had direct jets to Chicago during the early 1970s via Nashville. In April 1975, Eastern served Nashville, Orlando and St. Louis nonstop from Huntsville on 727s and DC-9s.

In November 1967, Eastern scheduled nine departures each weekday from the new airport while United had four and Southern had 17.

United Airlines started nonstop Boeing 727-100s to Los Angeles in 1969. United first served Huntsville in 1961 when it acquired Capital Airlines which had scheduled Vickers Viscounts nonstop from Huntsville&#x27;s old airport (at ) (1949 diagram) to Memphis, Knoxville and Washington, D.C., and direct to New York (LaGuardia and Newark) and Philadelphia. Until 1967, United used the same Viscounts, then introduced Boeing 727-100s into Huntsville in 1966. In April 1975, United served Greensboro, Knoxville, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., nonstop from Huntsville on 727s and 737s. Raleigh/Durham service was added by 1979. In August 1982, United had direct 727s to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Denver and nonstop Boeing 737-200s to Washington, D.C.

Southern Airways also served Huntsville. In the late 1960s, Southern introduced 75-seat Douglas DC-9-10s into their fleet which had consisted of 40-seat Martin 4-0-4. Southern&#x27;s timetable in September 1968 listed nonstop jets to Atlanta, Memphis, New Orleans and Muscle Shoals, AL; Southern was still flying Martin 4-0-4s from Huntsville. In April 1975, Southern DC-9s flew nonstop to Atlanta, Chattanooga, Memphis, Montgomery, Muscle Shoals, Nashville, New Orleans and Orlando. Southern had direct DC-9s to New York City (LaGuardia Airport), Washington, D,C. (Dulles Airport), Denver, St. Louis, Detroit and Wichita. In 1979, Southern merged with North Central Airlines to form Republic Airlines which continued to serve Huntsville, by that time having dropped Chattanooga and Montgomery service and having added Greenville/Spartanburg and Mobile/Pascagoula service. Republic was acquired by Northwest Airlines which later merged with Delta Air Lines.

Service to Atlanta hit a high point in early 1985 when 17 nonstops a day flew HSV to ATL on four airlines, three flying &quot;main line&quot; jets. In the February 15, 1985, Official Airline Guide, Eastern Airlines had Boeing 727-100s and Douglas DC-9-50s, Republic Airlines was flying Douglas DC-9-10s, DC-9-30s and DC-9-50s, United Airlines flew 727-100s and Delta Connection, operated by Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA, which became ExpressJet), had de Havilland Canada DHC-7s and Shorts 360s. Today, Delta Air Lines and affiliate Delta Connection are the only airlines between Huntsville and Atlanta.

By 1989, the airport was linked to major airline hubs: Delta served Atlanta and Dallas/Fort Worth, Eastern served Atlanta, American served Dallas/Fort Worth and Nashville, Northwest served Memphis, and United served Chicago and Washington Dulles. United and American flew nonstop to Birmingham, United continued to fly nonstop to Knoxville, and Delta had a daily flight to Memphis. United pulled out entirely by 1995, while USAir entered the market in the early 1990s with daily flights to Charlotte.

Only Delta Air Lines operates main line jets to the airport now. Frontier previously had Airbus A320 service nonstop to Denver and Orlando. Delta operates Boeing 717 and Boeing 737-800 and 900ER aircraft to Atlanta. The airline previously flew Douglas DC-9-50s nonstop to Atlanta with some flights being flown by ExpressJet Canadair CRJ-700 and CRJ-200s as Delta Connection service to ATL; however, all services to ATL have been switched to mainline jets. The airport had service to New Orleans on GLO Airlines, but that ended after the airline filed for bankruptcy in 2017. Frontier Airlines ended service in 2022.

==Expansion==
In 1989, Huntsville International became the first airport in the United States to install an ASR-9 dual-channel airport surveillance radar system. and became one of five airports in the United States to use glass-walled jet bridges. In 2015, Thyssenkrupp Airport Systems manufactured and installed new glass jet bridges, making Huntsville International Airport the first in the Southeast to enhance its facility by using all glass jet bridges.

Currently, Huntsville International is undergoing major renovations on its runways and concourse facilities to meet the expected future demand and flow of passengers and goods.

Huntsville International Airport will potentially be expanded to provide three additional runways that would be built to the west of County Line Road. This project is one of many projects that are included in the Huntsville area Metropolitan Planning Organization’s TRIP (Transportation Regionally Innovative Projects) 2045 plan. This project would also include a new loop around the airport, replacing County Line Road and Boeing Boulevard.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On October 17, 1965, a United Airlines Douglas DC-6 (flight # unknown) on takeoff accelerating through V1 speed raised the nosewheel from the runway. Suddenly, without a determined cause, the nose undercarriage retracted and the aircraft sank back, contacting the runway with its nose. The captain retarded the throttles and the aircraft slid to a stop 272 feet beyond the runway end. All 16 passengers and crew survived, but the plane was destroyed and written off.
*On June 18, 2014, an IAI Westwind corporate aircraft crashed upon takeoff, killing all three on board.

<doc id="295346" wikidata="Q2233600" url="?curid=295346" title="Tales of the Texas Rangers">
<text>Tales of the Texas Rangers is a 20th century Western old-time radio and television police procedural drama which originally aired on NBC Radio from 1950 to 1952 and later on CBS Television from 1955 to 1958. Film star Joel McCrea voiced the radio version as the fictitious Texas Ranger Jace Pearson, who uses the latest scientific techniques to identify criminals. His faithful horse, Charcoal (or &quot;Charky&quot;), helps Pearson to track down the culprits. The radio shows, some of which are available on the Internet, are reenactments of actual Texas Ranger cases.

The television version was produced and also directed for several episodes by Stacy Keach, Sr. It was sponsored for part of its run by Wheaties cereal. Captain Manuel T. &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; Gonzaullas, who was said to have killed thirty-one men during his 30-year career as a Texas Ranger, was the consultant for the television series, as he had been for the earlier radio series. The television version was filmed by Screen Gems.

On radio, Joel McCrea&#x27;s Pearson often worked by request with a local sheriff&#x27;s office or police department. But in the television version, Willard Parker assumed the role of Jace Pearson and had a regular partner, Ranger Clay Morgan, who had been an occasional character on the radio show. Morgan was portrayed in the television version by Harry Lauter. William Boyett appeared five times on the television series, including the role of Wade Crowell in the 1955 premiere episode, &quot;Ransom Flight.&quot;

During the opening and closing credits of the television series, the actors march toward the camera as an off-screen men&#x27;s chorus sings the theme song, &quot;These Are Tales of Texas Rangers&quot;, to the tune of &quot;The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Working on the Railroad&quot;. The radio series used contemporary cases and modern detective methods to solve crimes; it was a procedural drama, in many ways Jack Webb&#x27;s &quot;Dragnet&quot; with a Western flavor.

The television version had some episodes set in the 1950s, comparable in some ways to Rod Cameron&#x27;s syndicated series, &quot;State Trooper&quot;. Other episodes were set in the 19th century in a traditional Western genre. In each case, Parker and Lauter were involved with chases and shoot-outs.

Irving J. Moore, later with &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, began his career as a director on two episodes of &quot;Tales of the Texas Rangers&quot;. Besides Keach and Moore, the other directors included Lew Landers, George Blair, and Earl Bellamy.

<text>Berserk, also known in Japan as is a Japanese anime television series based on Kentaro Miura&#x27;s manga series &quot;Berserk&quot;. The series follows Guts, a skilled mercenary warrior who gets entangled with the Band of the Hawk, a mercenary group, and its ambitious leader, Griffith.

&quot;Berserk&quot; was produced by Nippon Television and VAP, animated by Oriental Light and Magic and directed by . It was broadcast for 25 episodes on Nippon TV from October 1997 to April 1998. &quot;Berserk&quot; was formerly licensed for English release in North America by Media Blasters, and later acquired by Discotek Media.

The series has been well-received, with critics praising its storytelling, characters, setting, and soundtrack by Susumu Hirasawa.

==Plot==

Guts, a lone mercenary warrior driven solely by his will to survive, becomes entangled with the Band of the Hawk, a mercenary group lead by the ambitious and charismatic Griffith. Guts quickly becomes Griffith&#x27;s most trusted warrior, drawn in by his dream to rule a kingdom. In the aftermath of a battle that nearly cost Guts and Griffith their lives, Griffith begins getting closer to the King of Midland&#x27;s daughter, Princess Charlotte. At one point, Guts overhears a conversation between Griffith and Charlotte, in which Griffith declares that he considers a true friend to be someone who has their own dream. Hired full-time by the kingdom of Midland, the Hawks helps to win a hundred-year war against the Tudor empire, while Guts develops a closer relationship with Casca, the Hawks&#x27; unit commander and only female member. Some time after the Hawks&#x27; victory, Guts decides to leave the group to stop living for Griffith&#x27;s dream. Griffith challenges Guts to make him desist, but is easily defeated. Psychologically devastated, Griffith, in a lapse of judgement, has sex with Charlotte, unaware that he is being observed. Consequently, Griffith is imprisoned and tortured, while the rest of the Hawks are marked for death.

After a year of training to become a better swordsman, Guts learns that the Hawks became outlaws. Guts goes to their aid, and together with Casca, they seek to rescue Griffith. They manage to find him mutilated, disfigured and rendered mute. As the Hawks feel helpless due to Griffith&#x27;s condition, Casca tells Guts that she must take care of Griffith, and that Guts should continue his own path. Overhearing them, Griffith takes off in a wagon, accidentally crashing into a river nearby. He crawls out of the wreckage, and attempts in vain to commit suicide by stabbing his throat into a sharp tree root. At that very moment, he finds his Behelit—a mysterious demonic relic, lost during his time imprisoned—and unintentionally activates it with the blood leaking from his neck, unleashing an event known as &quot;the Eclipse&quot;, taking everyone present to another plane of existence. The God Hand, a group of archdemons, informs Griffith that he has been chosen as their final member, and he must offer his comrades as sacrifices in exchange for power, to which Griffith accepts. The Hawks are branded as sacrificial offerings, being brutally slaughtered and devoured by the &quot;apostles&quot;—humans transformed into powerful demons by sacrificing their loved ones and their own humanity. Only Guts and Casca remain alive, and Griffith—reborn as the fifth God Hand member, Femto—rapes Casca in front of Guts, who is restrained by an apostle latched onto his arm. Guts loses his left arm and right eye in a futile attempt to save Casca. In a flashforward, Guts is shown to have survived the Eclipse. Now being known as the &quot;Black Swordsman&quot;, Guts begins a quest for revenge against the God Hand and the apostles.

==Reception==
&quot;Berserk&quot; has been overall well received by critics. Carlo Ross of THEM Anime Reviews said that, at first, he could not get into the &quot;dreary, depressing tone&quot; of &quot;Berserk&quot;, but added that as the series progresses, the viewer can meet the cast &quot;as more than just the standard fantasy archetypes&quot;, praising the characters for their realistic portraying. He said that &quot;Berserk&quot;″s violence was like &quot;a classic Kurosawa film&quot;, and that just like his films, &quot;Berserk&quot;″s lesson is that &quot;beneath all that metal armor, these soldiers are people.&quot; Ross concluded, &quot;If you want fantasy that really makes you think, then don&#x27;t let the name fool you. &quot;Berserk&quot; is not about turning your brain off. Not one bit.&quot; Brittany Vincent, writing for Anime News Network (ANN), said that &quot;Berserk&quot; &quot;excels in setting up this tone that defines the story, even if it happens to end abruptly without any real conclusion.&quot; Vincent wrote that the adaptation is not perfect and that it has &quot;its share of low-quality animation at times&quot;, but that it is &quot;an excellent stab at bringing the story to life.&quot; She also noted the omission of characters, like the elf Puck, omission that makes the series a &quot;much more serious and foreboding affair&quot;, also stating that the anime has several moments that &quot;speed up time or slow it down considerably.&quot; Sandra Scholes of Active Anime wrote, &quot;&quot;Berserk&quot; is a hard – hitting hack and slash demonically possessed horror fantasy of relentless proportions. There’s a good chance no one has seen this type of anime before or will again. This should be in everyone’s collection.&quot;

John Oppliger of AnimeNation said that the most appealing aspect of &quot;Berserk&quot; is &quot;its ability to present exhilarating, extremely violent action while never losing sight of characterization or the continuing storyline&quot;, praising the series as well for its &quot;very complex and unpredictable story.&quot; Rob Ghoul of PopCultureShock wrote that at first he was in for &quot;two hours of boredom&quot; at seeing &quot;a generic concept, coupled with typical TV quality production&quot;, but that suddenly &quot;a story broke out&quot;, adding that &quot;Berserk&quot; was not the &quot;mundane bloodfest&quot; he originally thought, and called it a &quot;gripping story.&quot; Eric Frederiksen, writing for Advanced Media Network, said that it would be easy to call &quot;Berserk&quot; a &quot;mindlessly violent piece of popcorn-gore&quot;, but he said that it is not about a &quot;man with a giant sword slicing through everything in his path&quot;, adding that the story and the characters are the real focus of the show, concluding, &quot;Part of what helps &quot;Berserk&quot; weather the ravages of time better than so many other shows is the sheer volume of stuff it gives us to think about, without shoving it down our throats.&quot; Chris Beveridge of AnimeOnDVD wrote, &quot;getting something that is just plain violent – but with a purpose and story – is a real treat and change of pace. Something that doesn’t pull away from the darker side of combat in a fantasy setting […] [I]t’s a series that just grabbed me and made me watch in fascination.&quot;

Zac Bertschy, writing for SciFi.com, stated that &quot;Berserk&quot; is &quot;possibly the most mature, intelligent, and just flat-out kick-butt fantasy series to ever come across the market&quot;, adding that the series explores themes like child abuse and schizophrenia, and that it is &quot;a major departure from other common anime fantasy series; it goes where most fear to tread.&quot; Bertschy concluded, &quot;If you&#x27;re a big fantasy fan and like mature, adult stories that aren&#x27;t afraid to explore even the darkest pits of the psyche, then is for you.&quot; In another review for ANN, Bertschy said that &quot;Berserk&quot; is the finest example of dark fantasy available on the market and that its original manga basis &quot;surpasses all others in terms of quality and popularity&quot;, adding that the series &quot;remains enchanting, entertaining and truly terrifying to this day.&quot;

Writing for Anime Jump, Mike Toole said, &quot;&quot;Berserk&quot; is one of those shows that&#x27;s just the Total Package-- if you&#x27;re a fan of action or fantasy and can handle hard-edged, violent stories, it&#x27;s just what you&#x27;re looking for.&quot; Praising the characters, the &quot;detailed, tightly-wound&quot; plot, and the &quot;furious&quot; battle scenes, concluding, &quot;If there were a such thing as &quot;realistic fantasy,&quot; &quot;Berserk&quot; would be it. Altogether, the show&#x27;s collective merits make it impossible to ignore—it&#x27;s truly one of the good ones.&quot; Toole, in another review for ANN, called &quot;Berserk&quot; &quot;a showcase of bad, weird animation&quot;, commenting that the distance of time helps to gloss over its issues. In comparing the series to the 2016 series, which was criticized for its handling of CGI, Toole wrote, &quot;It helps that animation mistakes tend to be a bit less noticeable in 2D.&quot;

Writing for About.com, Serdar Yegulalp said that &quot;Berserk&quot; is a &quot;grim but utterly gripping fantasy that makes &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; look like &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;&quot;, calling its violence &quot;brutal and disturbing&quot;, but that it has an &quot;epic storytelling with unforgettable characters.&quot; In another review, Yegulalp commented, &quot;Despite its abbreviated, abortive form, and despite a relatively crude animation style, &quot;Berserk&quot; was, and still is, one of the best anime of its kind&quot;, adding that, like &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, &quot;Berserk&quot; &quot;has an appeal far beyond the fantasy-adventure fans who became the show&#x27;s first and most vocal champions.&quot;

&quot;Berserk&quot;″s soundtrack has also been praised by critics. Ross said that the opening and ending themes were &quot;two of the least appropriate songs I have ever heard for an anime series&quot;, but that Hirasawa&#x27;s background tracks are &quot;rather memorable&quot;, highlighting &quot;Berserk: Forces&quot;, which he called &quot;an object lesson in how to use a synthesizer and reverb completely wrong, and yet still come up with something interesting and fresh anyway&quot;, adding that Hirasawa&#x27;s music is &quot;an acquired taste, to be sure - people either love it or hate it.&quot; Bertschy said that the music of &quot;Berserk&quot; is &quot;certainly worth praising&quot;, commenting that the score &quot;leaps effortlessly from haunting and melodic to dark and sinister in the blink of an eye, maintaining credibility and flow throughout.&quot; Yegulalp wrote, &quot;[Hirasawa] created the throbbing, disturbing score for the ultra-violent fantasy anime &quot;Berserk&quot;. Some of the synthesizer and sampler techniques used sound a bit primitive today, but they&#x27;re more than made up for by the haunting composition and songwriting. If the alternately joyful and sorrowful &quot;Guts&#x27;s Theme&quot; doesn&#x27;t send chills through you, there&#x27;s probably not much that could.&quot; Writing for Funimation, Kathleen Townsend highlighted &quot;Gut&#x27;s Theme&quot;, and stated, &quot;It’s particularly gentle for a world filled with evil and a fearsome protagonist willing to carve his own limbs away if it means helping those he loves. It’s peaceful and delicate, filled with hope and longing.&quot; Toole said that &quot;Berserk&quot;″s music has &quot;both ups and downs.&quot; On the upside, he lauded the incidental music, stating that the music is &quot;churning and intense, and lends a well-placed sense of urgency to the show&#x27;s plot&quot;, but Toole commented that the selection of compositions &quot;is pretty small, which means that a lot of themes, especially &quot;Forces,&quot; are used and reused incessantly. It&#x27;s a good soundtrack, and an unusual one, but it gets a bit repetitive.&quot; In another review, Toole said that Hirasawa&#x27;s &quot;churning, hypnotic&quot; musical output was &quot;as sort of like tossing Philip Glass, Yello, and Peter Gabriel into a centrifuge.&quot; Toole highlighted &quot;Berserk: Forces&quot;, and said that it has become &quot;iconic and wholly associated with the series.&quot; Toole concluded, &quot;I appreciate &quot;Berserk&quot;″s excellent direction and pacing and dig its atmospheric artwork, especially Kobayashi Production&#x27;s awesome painting work, but it&#x27;s the music that has aged the best.&quot; Friederickson wrote that Hirasawa&#x27;s synth-heavy soundtrack &quot;brings an otherworldly feeling that reminds of some of those great practical-effects-fueled &#x27;80s movies. It fits perfectly into this story where magic is beginning to emerge in a world where no one believes in it.&quot;

<text>Princess Ludovika of Bavaria (Marie Ludovika Wilhelmine; &quot;Mary Louise Wilhelmina&quot;; 30 August 1808 – 25 January 1892) was the sixth child of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his second wife Caroline of Baden. She was the mother of Empress Elisabeth of Austria and was born and died in Munich.

== Early years ==
Marie Ludovika Wilhelmine was born to King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Caroline of Baden as their sixth child. The birth of Ludovika was known to be difficult. Ludovika was christened one day after her birth as Ludovika Wilhelmine. 

Ludovika and her sisters received many lessons in literature as well as geography and history. They spoke both German and French.

== Marriage ==
Ludovika married Maximilian Joseph, Duke in Bavaria, whose father Duke Pius August in Bavaria was her cousin, on 9 September 1828 in Tegernsee. Ludovika was always frustrated that, unlike her elder sisters who married kings and Austrian archdukes, she would not be marrying someone with a grand title, but rather a peculiar and childish duke who had a fondness for circuses. Ludovika was determined to create dynastic marriages for her daughters. She and her husband had ten children, including Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Queen Maria Sofia of the Two Sicilies.

Maximilian was mostly away from home; due to this, Ludovika wrote that she spent their first wedding anniversary alone and wept. In 1830, Ludovika found herself pregnant with their first child. On 21 June 1831, she gave birth to a son whom they named Ludwig Wilhelm.

<text>Augusta Regional Airport (Augusta Regional Airport at Bush Field) is a city-owned public airport six miles (11 km) south of Augusta, in Richmond County, Georgia, United States.

In 2000 Bush Field airport changed its name to Augusta Regional Airport. The airport opened a new passenger terminal in December 2007 and renovated the entire property, designed by the LPA Group. Augusta Regional Airport, served by American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, and Delta Connection, utilizes the phrase &quot;Fly There, Fly Home&quot; as part of their marketing. Lower fares at Augusta Regional Airport have increased passenger usage during the past two years.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Augusta Regional Airport covers at an elevation of 144 feet (44 m) above mean sea level. It has one concrete and one asphalt runway: 17/35, 8,001 × 150 feet (2,439 × 46 m) and 8/26, 6,002 × 75 feet (1,829 × 23 m).

In the year ending July 31, 2022, the Augusta Regional Airport had 42,038 aircraft operations, an average of 115 per day: 49% general aviation, 19% air taxi, 16% military and 17% scheduled commercial. 18 aircraft were then based at this airport: 5 single-engine, 7 multi-engine, 4 jet and 2 helicopter.

===Commercial aircraft===
In early 2008, a typical day saw seven departures to Atlanta, GA on Bombardier CRJ-200 regional jets and ATR 72 turboprop aircraft by Delta Connection carriers, US Airways Express had seven departures to Charlotte, NC with turboprop Bombardier Dash 8-300s and Bombardier CRJ-200s. As of mid-2009, Delta Air Lines regional carrier Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) no longer operates the ATR-72 turboprop aircraft, and all ExpressJet flights into and out of Augusta are 50-seat CRJ-200 regional jets. US Airways Express served the airport with Dash 8-300 turboprops and CRJ-200s. American Eagle ended flights to Augusta on January 31, 2012, but it returned to Augusta once parent airline American Airlines overtook US Airways Express&#x27; parent US Airways in 2015.

Delta Air Lines has been flying to Augusta since May 2011 after an 11-year hiatus using the Boeing 717-200 aircraft flights to and from its hub in Atlanta.

During the Masters golf tournament, traffic through Augusta soars. Airlines respond with more flights on larger equipment, including Delta Air Lines Boeing 737s and 757s. During 2009 Masters week, Embraer E-170s and CRJ-900s were common, but larger aircraft were also sent to Augusta. Delta does operate mainline aircraft to Augusta on a daily basis from their hub in nearby Atlanta.

The presence of Fort Eisenhower in Augusta results in periodic military charter flights using widebody aircraft such as McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11 trijet aircraft, in the past operated by World Airways.

==History==


===Origins===
In 1941, the City of Augusta learned that the United States Army Air Corps was looking for a site to locate a basic Contract Pilot School. In March 1941, the president of the Chamber of commerce contacted Harold S. Darr, who operated a primary flight school for the Air Corps in Albany (Albany Army Airfield) to promote the idea to locate the new school in the Augusta area. With the Army&#x27;s approval, Darr chose a tract southeast of the City adjacent to the Savannah River. On March 22, 1941, Darr entered into an agreement with local officials to invest $500,000 in buying the acreage and building a school. Darr estimated that the school would employ 300 civilians with an annual payroll of $1.5 million, In turn, the City and Richmond County agreed to move a City-owned hangar from nearby Daniel Field, pave the aircraft parking ramp, pave a road in the area to create a runway, and provide convict labor with guards. The Air Corps set a very ambitious timetable by requiring that flight training begin no later than June 7, 1941. Construction started on April 1. The Air Corps and Darr did not go public with the project until April 5, when an announcement appeared in the local newspaper.

===World War II===
Training began on June 10, with flying cadets arriving from the Air Corps primary schools at Albany and Americus, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Camden, South Carolina, Arcadia and Lakeland, Florida. The initial aircraft complement numbered 24 Vultee BT-13 Valiant and BT-15 aircraft. The ten-week course consisted of 70 hours of flight training and 150 hours of ground training. Harold Darr named the school Georgia Aero Tech; however, the Army designated it the 72nd Army Air Force Flight Training Detachment. The school was one of only three contract pilot schools conducting basic training. In addition to the main school at Augusta, the following auxiliary airfields were utilized:
* Dionne Auxiliary Field 
* Yawn Auxiliary Field 

Shortly after flight training commenced in June 1941, Don C. Bush, a civilian flight instructor lost his life in an aircraft crash. The airfield was named Bush Field in his memory.

In January 1942, the Defense Plant Corporation, a corporation entity of the Federal government, bought the school from Harold Darr. With the United States now in the war, the size of the classes increased, requiring an expansion of the school&#x27;s facilities. Construction began on a ground training building in May and an additional barracks in June. The number of aircraft assigned to the school grew from 24 to around 100 BT-13s and BT-15s. Additional paved runways were eventually added.

During all 1943, the school operated at capacity with classes averaging around 160 students. By early 1944, training requirements began to decrease, and with the possibility at that time of closing nearby Camp Gordon, the Army suddenly had no use for the field. In September 1944, the Air Force closed the facility after training over 5,000 students.

The Reconstruction Finance Corporation used Bush Field until 1948 for the disposal and sale of surplus military aircraft. The surplus aircraft at Bush included almost every Army and Navy model, from primary trainers and drones to B-24s and large transports. Several were purchased by the upstart Flying Tiger Airline.

===Commercial use===
Bush Field became Augusta&#x27;s commercial airport on July 1, 1950, when the Federal Government transferred Bush Field to the City of Augusta and the airlines moved from Daniel Field to Bush Field. One of the airport&#x27;s most profitable initiatives occurred in 1955 when a transient terminal was opened to sell fuel and to provide service to visiting aircraft. To this day, the fueling operation continues as a major source of revenue for the airport, keeping it self-sufficient and profitable. No tax dollars or City funding has ever been needed to support the airport.

During the 1950s and 1960s passenger traffic grew. The old flight school barracks were renovated and leased to Continental Hotels. In 1961, an runway was completed. In 1964, Bush Field was the 135th-busiest airport in the nation. Jet service at the airport began in 1965. By the close of the 1960s, the airport had doubled its baggage claim area and added a terminal, a tower, a lobby, a hotel, parking meters, and a second runway.

The 1970s saw the airport&#x27;s industrial growth period. During the 1970s, Capitol Aviation of Georgia (not to be confused with Capitol Air) established itself at the airport with a million-dollar-plus airplane service facility. The company, now known as Landmark Aviation, developed a jet engine repair facility, an avionics-navigation shop, and a structural and aircraft systems repair shop. Landmark Aviation now employs roughly 220 people at the Augusta facility.

By the 1990s, Bush Field tenants and visitors were contributing about $290 million in annual economic activity with nearly 2,200 jobs attributed to the airport. In 2000, Bush Field was renamed Augusta Regional Airport at Bush Field.

The self-sufficient airport, which has never used tax dollars, completed the first-ever &quot;Master Plan&quot; in 2002. The Master Plan serves as a road map for future economic growth and development at and around the airport.

Several former World War II buildings of Georgia Aero Tech remain at Bush Field. The former mess hall, administration building, and ground school buildings formed part of the airport&#x27;s terminal building. The original swimming pool remained until 2008, but with a hotel built around it rather than cadet barracks. The hotel, pool, and terminal buildings were demolished in conjunction with the building of an entirely new terminal building. The FAA currently occupies the former Link trainer building. All the hangars are still in use – including the one moved from Daniel Field in 1941.

The ARFF Department at Augusta Regional Airport works on 3- to 24-hour shifts.

In 2021, Augusta Regional Airport became the home of Augusta University Health&#x27;s AirCare program. The air ambulance service through Metro Aviation provides medical transport services to Augusta University Medical Center from on-scene responses and from transportation to and from other medical facilities.

<text>Jane Esther Hamilton (born October 27, 1956) is an American former pornographic actress and current adult film director who performed under the stage name Veronica Hart during the 1980s. She is sometimes credited as Jane Hamilton, V. Hart, Veronica Heart, Victoria Holt, Randee Styles or just Veronica. Hart is a member of the AVN Hall of Fame.
Director Paul Thomas Anderson has called her &quot;the Meryl Streep of porn.&quot;

==Early life==
Hart was born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada. She graduated from high school at age 16 and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas at age 19 in 1976 with a degree in theatrical arts. After school she worked in England before returning to the United States and moving to New York City.

==Career==
Hart appeared in pornographic films from 1980 until 1982 and is best known for her performances in &quot;Amanda by Night&quot;, &quot;Wanda Whips Wall Street&quot;, &quot;Roommates&quot; and &quot;A Scent of Heather&quot;. She would often portray &quot;stylish native New Yorker&quot; characters in her films. Around 1984, she began directing segments on the Playboy TV series Electric Blue, appearing in B-Movies and working as a stripper. During the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s she directed, edited, and produced pornographic films, while making occasional (non-sexual) cameos in both mainstream and adult productions.

With the sale of VCA, her primary production company, to Hustler in 2003, and the direction of the company moving from feature, storyline-driven films to gonzo, she left the company when her existing contract expired. Afterwards, Hart moved on to other work, including working as a tour guide at the Erotic Heritage Museum in Las Vegas.

Hart has acted in off-Broadway theater productions such as &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot;, &quot;A Thurber Carnival&quot;, &quot;The Dyke And The Porn Star&quot;, and &quot;The Deep Throat Sex Scandal&quot;.

Hart portrays a judge in the film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and also appears in another Paul Thomas Anderson movie, &quot;Magnolia&quot;.

As of 2014 Hart had become a sex educator in China. An article in &quot;AVN&quot; magazine stated that she has been instructing women through an arrangement with a chain of adult retail stores and clubs called Sediva Maison.

==Personal life==
Hart married adult industry sound technician Michael Hunt in 1982, although they have since divorced. She has two sons, Chris and Max, who attended magnet schools for highly gifted students. Hart&#x27;s career had a negative impact on her sons, with her saying &quot;It&#x27;s horrible for them... I&#x27;m their loving mommy and nobody likes to think of their parents having sex and being famous for it. I&#x27;m not ashamed of what I do. I take responsibility for who I am. I chose. From the time they were kids, my stripping gear was washed and hanging in my bathtub. At the same time I apologize to my kids for how the choices in my life have affected them. They&#x27;re well adjusted and can joke with me about it: I know I&#x27;m going to spend the rest of my life on the couch&quot;.

<doc id="295367" wikidata="Q1673410" url="?curid=295367" title="Isaac Isaacs">
<text>Sir Isaac Alfred Isaacs, (6 August 1855 – 11 February 1948) was an Australian lawyer, politician, and judge who served as the ninth Governor-General of Australia, in office from 1931 to 1936. He had previously served on the High Court of Australia from 1906 to 1931, including as Chief Justice from 1930.

Isaacs was born in Melbourne and grew up in Yackandandah and Beechworth (in country Victoria). He began working as a schoolteacher at the age of 15, and later moved to Melbourne to work as a clerk and studied law part-time at the University of Melbourne. Isaacs was admitted to the bar in 1880, and soon became one of Melbourne&#x27;s best-known barristers. He was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1892, and subsequently served as Solicitor-General under James Patterson, and Attorney-General under George Turner and Alexander Peacock.

Isaacs entered the new federal parliament at the 1901 election, representing the Protectionist Party. He became Attorney-General of Australia in 1905, under Alfred Deakin, but the following year left politics in order to become a justice of the High Court. Isaacs was often in the minority in his early years on the court, particularly with regard to federalism, where he advocated the supremacy of the Commonwealth Government. The balance of the court eventually shifted, and he famously authored the majority opinion in the &quot;Engineers case&quot; of 1920, which abolished the reserved powers doctrine and fully established the paramountcy of Commonwealth law.

In 1930, Prime Minister James Scullin appointed Isaacs as Chief Justice, in succession to Sir Adrian Knox. Later that year, Scullin nominated Isaacs as his preferred choice for governor-general. The selection of an Australian (rather than the usual British aristocrat) was unprecedented and highly controversial. King George V was opposed to the idea but eventually consented, and Isaacs took office in January 1931 as the first Australian-born holder of the office. He was the first governor-general to live full-time at Yarralumla, and throughout his five-year term was popular among the public for his frugality during the Depression. Isaacs was Australia&#x27;s first Jewish High Court Justice, the first Jewish Chief Justice of Australia and also the first Jewish Governor-General of Australia. He was a strong Anti-Zionist.

==Early life==

Isaacs was the son of Alfred Isaacs, a tailor of Jewish ancestry from the town of Mława, Poland. Seeking better prospects, Alfred left Poland and worked his way across Germany, spending some months in Berlin and Frankfurt. By 1845 he had passed through Paris and arrived to work in London, where he met Rebecca Abrahams; the two married in 1849. After news of the 1851 Victorian gold rush reached England, Australia became a very popular destination and the Isaacs decided to emigrate. By 1854 they had saved enough for the fare, departing from Liverpool in June 1854 and arriving in Melbourne in September. Some time after arriving the Isaacs moved into a cottage and shopfront in Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, where Alfred continued his tailoring. Isaac Alfred Isaacs was born in this cottage on 6 August 1855. His family moved to various locations around Melbourne while he was young, then in 1859 moved to Yackandandah in northern Victoria, close to family friends. At this time Yackandandah was a gold mining settlement of 3,000 people.

Isaacs had siblings born in Melbourne and Yackandandah: John A. Isaacs, who later became a solicitor and Victorian Member of Parliament, and sisters Carolyn and Hannah were all born in Yackandandah. A brother was born in Melbourne, and another sister was born in Yackandandah, but both died very young. His first formal schooling was from sometime after 1860 at a small private establishment. At eight he won the school arithmetic prize, winning his photograph by the schoolmaster, who was also a photographer and bootmaker. Yackandandah state school was opened in 1863 and Isaacs enrolled as a pupil. Here he excelled academically, particularly in arithmetic and languages, though he was a frequent truant, walking off to spend time in the nearby mining camps. To help Isaacs gain a better quality education, in 1867, his family moved to nearby Beechworth first enrolling him in the Common school then in the Beechworth Grammar School. He excelled at the Grammar School, becoming dux in his first year and winning many academic prizes. In his second year he was employed part-time as an assistant teacher at the school, and took up after school tutoring of fellow students. In September 1870, when Isaacs was just 15 years old, he passed his examination as a pupil teacher and taught at the school from then until 1873. Isaacs was next employed as an assistant teacher at the Beechworth State School, the successor to the Common school.

While employed at the State School, Isaacs had his first experience of the law, as an unsuccessful litigant in an 1875 County Court case. He disputed a payment arrangement with the headmaster of his school, resigning as part of the dispute. After returning to teaching, now back at the Grammar School, he expanded his interest in the law; reading law books and attending court sittings.

As a child Isaacs became fluent in Russian, which his parents spoke frequently, as well as English and some German. Isaacs later gained varying degrees of proficiency in Italian, French, Greek, Hindustani and Chinese.

==Legal career==
In 1875, he moved to Melbourne and found work at the Prothonotary&#x27;s Office of the Law Department. In 1876, while still working full-time, he studied law at the University of Melbourne. He graduated in 1880 with a Master of Laws degree in 1883. He took silk as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1899.

==Political career==
===Victorian MP, 1892–1901===
In 1892 Isaacs was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as a liberal. He was the member for Bogong from May 1892 until May 1893 and between June 1893 and May 1901. In 1893 he became Solicitor-General in the Patterson ministry. From 1894 to 1899 he was Attorney-General in the Turner ministry, and served as acting Premier on some occasions. In 1897 he was elected to the convention to approve the terms of the Australian Constitution. However, he was not elected to the committee drafting the constitution; Alfred Deakin attributed this failure to &quot;a plot discreditable to all engaged in it&quot; and thought that this antagonizing and humiliating snub sharpened Isaacs&#x27;s &quot;tendency to minute technical criticism ... so as to bring him not infrequently into collision&quot; with the committee. Isaacs had many reservations about the draft constitution, but he campaigned in support of it after the Australian Natives&#x27; Association gave the draft its full support, rejecting his plea to delay for further consideration.

===Federal MP, 1901–1906===

Isaacs was elected to the first federal Parliament in 1901 to the seat of Indi as a critical supporter of Edmund Barton and his Protectionist government. He was one of a group of backbenchers pushing for more radical policies and he earned the dislike of many of his colleagues through what they saw as his aloofness and rather self-righteous attitude to politics.

Alfred Deakin appointed Isaacs Attorney-General in 1905 but he was a difficult colleague and in 1906 Deakin was keen to get him out of politics by appointing him to the High Court bench. He was the first serving minister to resign from the parliament.

==High Court, 1906–1931==

On the High Court, Isaacs joined H. B. Higgins as a radical minority on the court in opposition to the chief justice, Sir Samuel Griffith. He served on the court for 24 years, acquiring a reputation as a learned and radical but uncollegial justice. Isaacs was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 1928 for his service on the High Court. Isaacs is one of only eight justices of the High Court to have served in the Parliament of Australia prior to his appointment to the court; the others were Edmund Barton, Richard O&#x27;Connor, H. B. Higgins, Edward McTiernan, John Latham, Garfield Barwick, and Lionel Murphy. He was also one of two to have served in the Parliament of Victoria, along with Higgins. In April 1930, the Labor Prime Minister, James Scullin, appointed the 75-year-old Isaacs as chief justice, succeeding Sir Adrian Knox.

==Governor-General, 1931–1936==

Shortly after Isaacs became Chief Justice, the office of governor-general fell vacant and, after Cabinet discussion, Scullin offered the post to Isaacs. Although the proposal was supposed to be confidential until communicated to King George V, word got out. While Isaacs was personally esteemed, public opinion divided strongly over whether a governor-general should be an Australian, with perceived risks of local political bias. During Scullin&#x27;s 1930 trip to Europe he personally advised the King to make the appointment and, although the King shared the concern about local political bias, he reluctantly accepted Scullin&#x27;s advice, while noting in his diary that he thought the choice would be “very unpopular” in Australia.

Isaacs&#x27;s appointment was announced in December 1930, and he was sworn in on 22 January 1931. He was the first Australian-born governor-general. Thus Isaacs agreed to a reduction in salary and conducted the office with great frugality. He gave up his official residences in Sydney and Melbourne and most official entertaining. Although he was sworn into office in the chamber of the Victorian Legislative Council in Melbourne, rather than in Parliament House in Canberra, he was the first governor-general to live permanently at Government House, Canberra. This was well-received with the public, as was Isaacs&#x27;s image of rather austere dignity. Isaacs was promoted to a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in April 1932. His term as governor-general concluded on 23 January 1936, and he retired to Victoria. In 1937, he was further honoured with the award of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.

==Personal life==
Isaacs married Deborah &quot;Daisy&quot; Jacobs, daughter of a tobacco merchant, at her parents&#x27; home in St Kilda on 18 July 1888. They had two daughters, one born in 1890 and the other in 1892. The daughters were Marjorie Isaacs Cohen who died in 1968 and was survived by a son (Thomas B. Cohen), and Nancy Isaacs Cullen. Lady Isaacs died at Bowral, New South Wales, in 1960.

==Later life and death==
Isaacs was 81 when his term ended in 1936, but his public life was far from over. He remained active in various causes for another decade and wrote frequently on matters of constitutional law. In the 1940s he became embroiled in controversy with the Jewish community both in Australia and internationally through his outspoken opposition to Zionism. His principal critic was Julius Stone. Isaacs was supported by Rabbi Jacob Danglow (1880–1962) and Harold Boas. Isaacs insisted that Judaism was a religious identity and not a national or ethnic one. He opposed the notion of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Isaacs said &quot;[p]olitical Zionism to which I am irrevocably opposed for the reasons which will be found clearly stated, must be sharply distinguished from religious and cultural Zionism to which I am strongly attached.&quot;

Isaacs opposed Zionism partly because he disliked nationalism of all kinds and saw Zionism as a form of Jewish national chauvinism—and partly because he saw the Zionist agitation in Palestine as disloyalty to the British Empire, to which he was devoted. Following the King David Hotel bombing in 1946, he wrote that &quot;the honour of Jews throughout the world demands the renunciation of political Zionism&quot;. 
Isaacs&#x27;s main objections to Political Zionism were:

# &quot;A negation of Democracy, and an attempt to revert to the Church-State of bygone ages.
# Provocative of anti-Semitism.
# Unwarranted by the Balfour Declaration, the Mandate, or any other right; contrary to Zionist assurances to Britain and to the Arabs and in present conditions unjust to other Palestinians politically and to other religions.
# As regards unrestricted immigration, a discriminatory and an undemocratic camouflage for a Jewish State.
# An obstruction to the consent of the Arabs to the peaceful and prosperous settlement in Palestine of hundreds of thousands of suffering European Jews, the victims of Nazi atrocities; and provocative of Muslim antagonism within and beyond the Empire, and consequently a danger to its integrity and safety.
# Inconsistent in demanding on one hand, on a basis of a separate Jewish nationality everywhere Jews are found, Jewish domination in Palestine, and at the same time claiming complete Jewish equality elsewhere than in Palestine, on the basis of a nationality common to the citizens of every faith.&quot;

Isaacs said &quot;the Zionist movement as a whole...now places its own unwarranted interpretation on the Balfour Declaration, and makes demands that are arousing the antagonism of the Muslim world of nearly 400 millions, thereby menacing the safety of our Empire, endangering world peace and imperiling some of the most sacred associations of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim faiths. Besides their inherent injustice to others these demands would, I believe, seriously and detrimentally affect the general position of Jews throughout the world&quot;.

In his later years, Isaacs became embroiled in legal battles with Edna Davis, the wife of his brother John. He forced her out of the family home, reclaimed her wedding ring, and finally had her declared a vexatious litigant.

Isaacs died at his home in South Yarra, Victoria, in the early hours of 11 February 1948, at the age of 92. He was the last surviving member of Alfred Deakin&#x27;s 1905–1906 Cabinet. The Commonwealth government accorded him a state funeral, held on 13 February, and he was buried in Melbourne General Cemetery after a synagogue service.

==Honours==
In May 1949 he was honoured with the naming of the Australian Electoral Division of Isaacs in the outer southern suburbs of Melbourne. At a redistribution in November 1968, the electorate was abolished and a separate Division of Isaacs was created in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It exists to this day. The Canberra suburb of Isaacs was named after him in 1966.

In 1973 Isaacs was honoured with an Australian postage stamp bearing his portrait.

<text>Solar is an American fictional comic book superhero created by writer Paul S. Newman, editor Matt Murphy, and artist Bob Fujitani. The character first appeared in &quot;Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom&quot; #1 in 1962 by Gold Key Comics and has since appeared in other incarnations in books published by Valiant Comics in the 1990s, Dark Horse Comics in the 2000s, and Dynamite Entertainment in the 2010s.

==Publication history==
===Gold Key Comics===
 Solar was created in 1962 by writer Paul S. Newman and editor Matt Murphy, with illustrations from artist Bob Fujitani, for the Silver Age comic book publisher Gold Key, a new company formed by Western Publishing who, earlier that year, had ended its business arrangement with Dell Comics. The character premiered in issue #1 of &quot;Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom&quot; in Summer 1962 (cover date October 1962) in the first batch of comics released by Gold Key, with Solar being Gold Key&#x27;s first original character.

Though Gold Key did not have as large a distribution network as Dell Comics, their comics stood out on the newsstand shelves because of their cover art and their 12 cent price, a bargain when contrasted with the 15 cent price on Dell&#x27;s books. Early issues of Solar out sold Superman two to one. The first two issues of Solar appeared with cover paintings by Richard M. Powers; after the second issue the cover paintings were done by George Wilson. The interior artwork in the first few issues also had unique features: the superhero, Dr. Solar, did not have a costume until the fifth issue, rectangular word balloons and no black holding line around each panel. Following the practice of Dell Comics, and thanks to Western Publishing&#x27;s reputation of publishing other child-friendly books, &quot;Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom&quot; was able to be distributed without the Comics Code Authority symbol. The original creative team of writer Paul S. Newman and artist Bob Fujitani lasted until issue #5 when Frank Bolle took over the art work. With the exception of issue #7 written by Otto Binder, Newman wrote the comic book until issue #10, when Dick Wood took over for the remainder of the series. Other artists who contributed included: Mel Crawford, Win Mortimer, Alden McWilliams (issues #20-23), Ernie Colón (issues #24-26), José Delbo (issue #27).

The popularity of this original series peaked in 1965. With a price increase to 15 cents with issue #25 in 1968, and a general decline in sales in the comic book industry in the late-1960s, Gold Key cancelled the series in 1969 with issue #27. In one of Gold Key&#x27;s few cross-overs, Doctor Solar re-appeared in the 1975 comic book &quot;The Occult Files of Doctor Spektor&quot; #14. In the early-1980s, with another industry contraction, Gold Key withdrew from distribution to newsstands and began publishing comics under the Whitman Comics imprint. These were distributed to retail stores (e.g. department stores, toy stores, specialty comic book stores) in poly-bagged packages of three comic books. For this purpose, &quot;Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom&quot; was restarted at #28 (cover date April 1981) with Roger McKenzie writing and Dan Spiegle drawing. This initiative was short-lived and the series was cancelled again after only four issues.

===Valiant Comics===
Solar next appeared in 1991 when Valiant Comics restarted the series with a new premise. Western Publishing had been distributing Valiant&#x27;s Nintendo and World Wrestling Entertainment comics and agreed to allow Valiant to license characters from the Gold Key library. Valiant intended to use successful Gold Key characters to launch a superhero line of comics and spin-off original characters under the direction of editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, who had previously, unsuccessfully launched the Marvel Comics superhero line New Universe. With Valiant&#x27;s video game and wrestling comics experiencing limited success, they launched the new line in 1991 with &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot;, followed by &quot;Solar, Man of the Atom&quot; a couple of months later.

The new Solar series began with three multi-part stories all written by Jim Shooter: &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot; with artwork by Barry Windsor-Smith and Bob Layton, spanned the first ten issues and told of the origin story of how the protagonist, Phil Seleski, became Solar, until the time he accidentally destroys the world; &quot;Second Death&quot;, with artwork by Don Perlin, Bob Layton and Thomas Ryder, spanned the first four issues and tells of Seleski&#x27;s attempt to prevent another version of himself from destroying the world; &quot;First Strike&quot;, with artwork by Don Perlin and Stan Drake, spanned issues #5 to #8 and follows Solar as he fights spider aliens. These first year stories included first appearances by Eternal Warrior, the Harbinger Foundation, Geomancers, and the X-O Manowar armor - all of which would be spun off into their own series.
With its US$1.75 cover price, and benefiting from Valiant&#x27;s heavy promotion of its superhero line and its combined direct and newsstand distribution network, &quot;Solar&quot; was returning a small profit with print runs of approximately 60,000 copies of each issue in the first year. The second year began with two tie-in issues with the &quot;Unity&quot; storyline with Solar appearing in the other Valiant titles that also tied into that storyline. The popularity of &quot;Unity&quot; significantly raised demand for Valiant products, including new issues and back issues. &quot;Solar&quot;&#x27;s print run rapidly grew to peak at 360,000 copies of issue #23, which by that time, mid-1993, had a cover price of US$2.25. Following Shooter&#x27;s ouster from Valiant Comics in 1992, Kevin VanHook took over the writing job and &quot;Solar&quot; editor Bob Layton also became Valiant&#x27;s editor-in-chief. Steve Ditko pencilled issues #14 and #15 before Pater Grau took over until #35. During that time Solar appeared in other Valiant titles, such as &quot;Archer &amp; Armstrong&quot;, &quot;Rai&quot;, &quot;Secret Weapons&quot;, &quot;X-O Manowar&quot;, and &quot;Harbinger Files&quot;, as well as Deathmate, and &quot;The Chaos Effect&quot;.

After Acclaim Entertainment took over ownership of Valiant in Summer 1994, VanHook continued as writer but the penciller job was divided between Andrew Wendell and Louis Small until issue #41 at the end of the year. Stephen D. Sullivan wrote the next two issues with Scott Rosema as penciller, followed by two issues by writer Christopher Priest and penciller Rik Levins. Acclaim launched a publicity strategy dubbed &quot;Birthquake&quot; which attracted high profile comic book writers and artists to work on their titles. Dan Jurgens took over as writer and penciller, with Dick Giordano as inker, beginning with issue #46 until issue #51 when Tom Grindberg took over as penciller for four issues. As sales continued to fall, Tony Bedard took over as writer from #52, with Aaron Lopresti, Mike Manley and Jeff Johnson dividing the penciller job, until the series was cancelled with issue #60 in 1996.

===Acclaim Comics===
Acclaim cancelled the remainder of the Valiant titles in 1996 and restarted a select few under a new creative direction with Fabian Nicieza as editor-in-chief. They published the one-shot &quot;Solar, Man of the Atom&quot; with a May 1997 cover date, written by Warren Ellis, and penciled by Darick Robertson. It was followed by a second one-shot &quot;Solar, Man of the Atom: Revelations&quot; (cover date November 1997) by Jim Krueger, Patrick Zircher and Jimmy Palmiotti. Acclaim&#x27;s final attempt at Solar was the four-issue mini-series &quot;Solar, Man of the Atom: Hell on Earth&quot; by Christopher Priest, Patrick Zircher, ChrisCross, and Romeo Tanghal. While Acclaim continued to publish comics for several more years, the rights to Solar lapsed and reverted to Classic Media, which had acquired Western Publishing&#x27;s properties in 2001.

===Dark Horse Comics===

Amid an industry-wide resurgence in the popularity of publishing high quality reprint collections, such as Marvel Golden Age Masterworks and the DC Archive series, Dark Horse Comics acquired the rights to reprint Dell and Gold Key comics. Dark Horse published a four volume hard-cover series that reprinted the entire Gold Key Doctor Solar series, including his appearance in &quot;The Occult Files of Dr. Spektor&quot; #14, with the first volume being released in 2004 covering issue 1 to 7. The second and third volumes were released in 2005 and covered issues 8 to 22. The final volume was released two years later, in 2007, covering issues 23 to 31 as well as the &quot;Dr. Spektor&quot; issue.

In 2008, Dark Horse Comics announced that the company intended to publish an original &quot;Solar&quot; series, as well as other Gold Key characters. A year later, at San Diego Comic-Con, Dark Horse announced Jim Shooter would be the new series&#x27; writer. The new &quot;Solar&quot; series ran for eight issues, plus a preview issue. A trade paperback collection was released that collected the preview issue and #1-4 of the comic in its first volume, and the remaining issues (#5-8) in its second volume.

===Dynamite Entertainment===
In 2013, Dynamite Entertainment acquired the publishing rights to &quot;Solar&quot;, &quot;Turok&quot;, &quot;Magnus: Robot Fighter&quot; and &quot;Doctor Spektor&quot;. Dynamite released a &quot;Solar: Man of The Atom&quot; ongoing series; it lasted for 12 issues, from March 2014 to February 2015.

==Fictional character biography==

===Gold Key Comics===
The original Doctor Solar was a physicist named Dr. Phillip Solar who attempted to assist fellow worker Dr. Bently avert an imminent meltdown of the nuclear power plant where they worked. It had been sabotaged by Dr. Rasp, agent of an evil mastermind named Nuro. Bently lost his life trying to prevent the meltdown, while Solar absorbed a massive amount of radiation in the process. He survived and discovered that he had gained the ability to convert his body into any kind of nuclear energy. Using his new powers, Solar began searching for Nuro, who would become his nemesis. Nuro used a robot double of himself called Orun and later transferred his mind into it, calling himself King Cybernoid.

The character was initially envisioned as a &quot;post-modern superhero&quot; who didn&#x27;t wear a traditional superhero outfit, but readers wrote in and demanded a costume. In the fifth issue, Doctor Solar donned a superhero costume, and became known as &quot;The Man of the Atom&quot;. In addition, his skin turned green whenever he used his powers. At about that same time, in an &quot;Ask Doctor Solar&quot; column, Gold Key Comics changed Solar&#x27;s first name from Phillip to Raymond.

===Valiant Comics===
This version, known simply as Solar, was a physicist named Phil Seleski. Seleski was a fan of the Gold Key line, especially the adventures of Doctor Solar. One day, Seleski and his colleagues were testing a new type of fusion reactor located in the town of Muskogee. When an accidental breach threatened to obliterate the entire city, Seleski rushed to shut down the reactor. He succeeded, but he was exposed to lethal doses of radiation in the process. However, this did not prove to be fatal, but rather, gave him the ability to manipulate all forms of matter and energy. Seleski tried to use his powers for the good of mankind by attempting to destroy the world&#x27;s supply of nuclear weapons. The U.S. government attempted to stop him and their efforts caused Seleski to lose control of his powers, which in turn caused Earth to fall into a giant black hole.

Seleski was thrown several weeks back in time. The guilt over his role in the destruction of his world caused him to split into two beings: Doctor Solar, who believed himself to be Seleski&#x27;s childhood hero; and Phil Seleski, who retained all the memories of the original. Seleski sought to prevent the accident that gave him his powers from taking place. His efforts were complicated by the presence of Doctor Solar, who was convinced that Seleski was a dangerous criminal. Eventually, Seleski convinced his alter-ego that they needed to work together, and the two of them fused with the past version of Seleski and prevented the accident. In the process, they discovered that Seleski&#x27;s fusion reactor was actually a &quot;wish machine&quot; that allowed anyone in close proximity to change the universe in any way they saw fit. Before the original accident, Seleski wished that he could become his childhood superhero. As a result, the reactor simulated the events that gave the original Doctor Solar his powers. Seleski also found out that he did not travel to the past but instead recreated his universe after falling into the black hole. However, this universe was now populated by a large number of super-powered beings. The revelations inspired Seleski to take up the mantle of his childhood hero, becoming known as Solar, Man of the Atom.

Solar went on to have several adventures, fighting a wide variety of threats such as the Spider Aliens, malevolent Harbingers and Mothergod. He survived for several centuries and blew himself up in 4000 A.D. in an effort to stop the Spider Alien invasion of Earth.

===Acclaim Comics===
The Seleski twins, Frank and Helena, were transformed into the Acclaim Universe&#x27;s Solar after Phil Seleski left them a portion of his powers.

==Powers and abilities==
Dr. Solar is a trained scientist, specializing in nuclear physics. Because he has been irradiated, he is now, in effect, a living nuclear battery. No longer dependent on food and water – in fact, no longer having either a heartbeat or a human metabolism – he obtains the energy he needs by exposing himself to nuclear radiation. After absorbing this radiation, especially in large amounts, his skin turns green. It is often several hours before his skin color returns to normal, especially if he has absorbed a larger amount of energy than normal. As a result, he has to wear clothing impregnated with cadmium and lead, and wear specially made dark glasses to protect his co-workers from radiation poisoning. The uniform he later adopts is also lined with cadmium and lead. A visor shields his eyes. On his belt there is almost always a small pouch containing radioisotopes, in pill or capsule form, which he can swallow to boost his energy level in an emergency.

As with any battery, Solar becomes weaker as he draws upon his stored-up energy for various purposes. If too much energy is expended, however, Solar weakens rapidly. More than once, he has nearly died when his energy reserves were depleted too rapidly or too greatly. In some cases, Solar has absorbed so much energy that he has grown to an enormous size, only to shrink back to normal dimensions once the excess energy has been expended. In one case, he absorbed energy from a pile of nuclear waste that his arch-enemy, Nuro, was using to power a gold accumulator in the Pacific Ocean. Fearing that he would lose so much energy that he would not be able to maintain control over his own atomic structure, Solar was forced to retreat. He later resolved this problem, and then returned to destroy the accumulator, thereby foiling Nuro&#x27;s plot.

Solar can draw upon his stored-up energy at will, releasing and directing it into virtually any form he chooses. He can also use it to defy gravity, thus giving him the power of flight. He can also produce a &quot;heat exchange&quot; effect to reduce an object&#x27;s temperature to absolute zero in a matter of seconds. He can also manipulate matter at the atomic and sub-atomic level, although the energy cost is usually quite high. In one instance, Solar was able to change a huge iron meteorite into titanium through a form of neutron bombardment called &quot;transmutation&quot;, although his nuclear reserves were almost fatally depleted in the process (he was able to restore his energy by flying a small satellite rocket into the Van Allen radiation belt). Finally, if his energy level is high enough, he can travel through time, and has done so on several occasions.

As a scientist at a government nuclear research facility known as &quot;Atom Valley&quot;, Solar is constantly engaged in nuclear and nuclear-related research. His unique powers enable him to work without the need for lead shielding, since he can absorb radiation and store it up for his own use. In addition, in his secret identity of &quot;The Man of the Atom&quot;, Solar is always ready to use his powers to aid the public when the need arises.

<doc id="295380" wikidata="Q2901648" url="?curid=295380" title="Augusta State Airport">
<text>Augusta State Airport is a public use airport located one nautical mile (2 km) west of the central business district of the state capital of Augusta, a city in Kennebec County, Maine, United States. The airport is owned by the state of Maine, but managed and operated by the city of Augusta. It is served by one commercial airline, with scheduled passenger service subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.

As per the Federal Aviation Administration, this airport had 3,554 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 3,663 in 2009, and 4,300 in 2010. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a non-primary commercial service facility.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Augusta State Airport covers an area of 406 acres (164 ha) at an elevation of 352 feet (107 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt-paved runways: 17/35 is 5,001 by 150 feet (1,524 x 46 m) and 8/26 is 2,703 by 75 feet (824 x 23 m).

For the 12-month period ending August 11, 2016, the airport had 24,500 aircraft operations, an average of 67 per day: 69% general aviation, 22% air taxi, and 6% military. In April 2018, 37 aircraft were based at this airport: 31 single-engine and 6 multi-engine.
The airport was originally developed under a New Deal project by the Maine Emergency Relief Administration, the state division of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration in a statewide survey of airports by Capt. Harry M. Jones in January 1934. The airport was built with one north-south 2,000x80’ gravel runway, one east-west 1,600x80’ gravel runway, and one northeast-southwest 2,500x80’ gravel runway.

Runway 17/35 was reconstructed in the summer of 2012. The original surface was ground up and reclaimed, and runway lights and other navigational aids were upgraded. The project cost $7.5 million and was funded by the federal government. The project required closing the runway for two months, and it was reopened at 3:41 pm on June 29.

The airport received a federal grant of $1 million to purchase new snow removal equipment. The equipment should enable the airport to remain open during snowstorms.

<doc id="295384" wikidata="Q44319" url="?curid=295384" title="Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria">
<text>Maximilian I Joseph (; 27 May 1756 – 13 October 1825) was Duke of Zweibrücken from 1795 to 1799, prince-elector of Bavaria (as Maximilian IV Joseph) from 1799 to 1806, then King of Bavaria (as Maximilian I Joseph) from 1806 to 1825. He was a member of the House of Palatinate-Birkenfeld-Zweibrücken, a branch of the House of Wittelsbach.

==Early life==
Maximilian, the son of the Count Palatine Frederick Michael of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld and Maria Francisca of Sulzbach, was born on 27 May 1756 at Schwetzingen, between Heidelberg and Mannheim.

After the death of his father of testicular cancer in 1767, he was left at first without parental supervision, since his mother had been banished from her husband&#x27;s court after giving birth to a son fathered by an actor. Maximilian was carefully educated under the supervision of his uncle, Duke Christian IV of Zweibrücken, who settled him in the Hôtel des Deux-Ponts. He became Count of Rappoltstein in 1776 and took service in 1777 as a colonel in the French Royal Army. He rose rapidly to the rank of major-general. From 1782 to 1789, he was stationed at Strasbourg. During his time at the University of Strasbourg, Klemens von Metternich, the future Austrian chancellor, was for some time accommodated by Prince Maximilian. By the outbreak of the French Revolution, Maximilian exchanged the French for the Austrian service and took part in the opening campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars.

==Duke of Zweibrücken and Elector of Bavaria and the Palatinate==

On 1 April 1795, Maximilian succeeded his brother Charles II as Duke of Zweibrücken, however his duchy was entirely occupied by revolutionary France at the time. 

On 16 February 1799, he became Elector of Bavaria and Count Palatine of the Rhine, Arch-Steward of the Empire, and Duke of Berg upon the extinction of the Palatinate-Sulzbach line at the death of Elector Charles Theodore of Bavaria. The new elector, as Maximilian IV Joseph, found the Bavarian army in abject condition on his accession to the throne: Hardly any of the units were at full strength, the Rumford uniforms were unpopular and impractical, and the troops were badly-trained. The young Prince-Elector, who had served under the Ancien Régime in France as a colonel in the Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment, made the reconstruction of the army a priority. 

Maximilian&#x27;s sympathy with France and the ideas of enlightenment at once manifested itself when he acceded to the throne of Bavaria. In the newly organized ministry, Count Max Josef von Montgelas, who, after falling into disfavour with Charles Theodore, had acted for a time as Maximilian Joseph&#x27;s private secretary, was the most potent influence, wholly &quot;enlightened&quot; and French. Agriculture and commerce were fostered, the laws were ameliorated, a new criminal code drawn up, taxes and imposts equalized without regard to traditional privileges, while a number of religious houses were suppressed and their revenues used for educational and other useful purposes. He closed the University of Ingolstadt in May 1800 and moved it to Landshut.

In foreign affairs, Maximilian Joseph&#x27;s attitude was, from the German point of view, less commendable. He never had any sympathy with the growing sentiment of German nationality, and his attitude was dictated by wholly dynastic, or at least Bavarian, considerations. Until 1813, he was the most faithful of Napoleon&#x27;s German allies, the relationship cemented by the marriage of his eldest daughter to Eugène de Beauharnais. His reward came with the Treaty of Pressburg (26 December 1805), by the terms of which he was to receive the royal title and important territorial acquisitions in Swabia and Franconia to round off his kingdom. He assumed the title of king on 1 January 1806. On 15 March, he ceded the Duchy of Berg to Napoleon&#x27;s brother-in-law Joachim Murat. After the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809 he received Tyrol and Innviertel regions from the defeated Austria.

==King of Bavaria==

The new King of Bavaria was the most important of the princes belonging to the Confederation of the Rhine, and remained Napoleon&#x27;s ally until the eve of the Battle of Leipzig, when by the Treaty of Ried (8 October 1813) he made the guarantee of the integrity of his kingdom the price of his joining the Allies. On 14 October, Bavaria made a formal declaration of war against Napoleonic France. The treaty was passionately backed by Crown Prince Ludwig and by Marshal von Wrede.

By the first Treaty of Paris (3 June 1814), however, he returned Tyrol to Austria in exchange for the former Grand Duchy of Würzburg. At the Congress of Vienna, which he attended in person, Maximilian had to make further concessions to Austria, ceding Salzburg and the regions of Innviertel and Hausruckviertel in return for the western part of the old Palatinate. The king fought hard to maintain the contiguity of the Bavarian territories as guaranteed at Ried but the most he could obtain was an assurance from Metternich in the matter of the Baden succession, in which he was also doomed to be disappointed.
At Vienna and afterwards Maximilian sturdily opposed any reconstitution of Germany which should endanger the independence of Bavaria, and it was his insistence on the principle of full sovereignty being left to the German reigning princes that largely contributed to the loose and weak organization of the new German Confederation. The of the Congress of Vienna was proclaimed in Bavaria, not as a law but as an international treaty. It was partly to secure popular support in his resistance to any interference of the Federal diet in the internal affairs of Bavaria, partly to give unity to his somewhat heterogeneous territories, that Maximilian on 26 May 1818 granted a liberal constitution to his people. Montgelas, who had opposed this concession, had fallen in the previous year, and Maximilian had also reversed his ecclesiastical policy, signing on 24 October 1817 a concordat with Rome by which the powers of the clergy, largely curtailed under Montgelas&#x27;s administration, were restored.

The new parliament proved to be more independent than he had anticipated and in 1819 Maximilian resorted to appealing to the powers against his own creation; but his Bavarian &quot;particularism&quot; and his genuine popular sympathies prevented him from allowing the Carlsbad Decrees to be strictly enforced within his dominions. The suspects arrested by order of the Mainz Commission he was accustomed to examine himself, with the result that in many cases the whole proceedings were quashed, and in not a few the accused dismissed with a present of money.

Maximilian died at Nymphenburg Palace, in Munich, on 13 October 1825 and was succeeded by his son Ludwig I. Maximilian is buried in the crypt of the Theatine Church in Munich.

Under the reign of Maximilian Joseph the Bavarian Secularization (1802–1803) led to the nationalisation of cultural assets of the Church. The Protestants were emancipated. In 1808 he founded the Academy of Fine Arts Munich.

The city of Munich was extended by the first systematic expansion with the new Brienner Strasse as core. In 1810 Max Joseph ordered construction of the National Theatre Munich in French neo-classic style. The monument &quot;Max-Joseph Denkmal&quot; before the National Theatre was created in the middle of the square Max-Joseph-Platz as a memorial for King Maximilian Joseph by Christian Daniel Rauch and carried out by Johann Baptist Stiglmaier. It was only revealed in 1835 since the king had rejected to be eternalized in sitting position.

In 1801 he led the rescue operation when a glassmaker&#x27;s workshop collapsed, saving the life of Joseph von Fraunhofer, a 14-year-old orphan apprentice. Max Joseph donated books and directed the glassmaker to give Fraunhofer time to study. Fraunhofer went on to become one of the most famous optical scientists and artisans in history, inventing the spectroscope and spectroscopy, making Bavaria noted for fine optics, and joining the nobility before his death at age 39.

He was elected a Royal Fellow of the Royal Society in 1802.

==Marriages and issue==
As a monarch, Max Joseph was very close to the citizens, walked freely along the streets of Munich without great accompaniment, and conversed with his people in a casual manner. Regardless, he was somewhat eccentric, like some of his descendants and successors. Maximilian married twice and had children by both marriages:

His first wife was Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt, daughter of Prince George William of Hesse-Darmstadt (14 April 1765 – 30 March 1796). They were married on 30 September 1785 in Darmstadt. They had five children:
* Ludwig I of Bavaria (25 August 1786 – 29 February 1868), married Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen.
* Princess Augusta Amalia Ludovika, (21 June 1788 – 13 May 1851), married Eugène de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg.
* Princess Amalie Marie Auguste (9 October 1790 – 24 January 1794), died in childhood.
* Princess Caroline Augusta (8 February 1792 – 9 February 1873), married William I of Württemberg, and then Francis II of Austria.
* Prince Karl Theodor Maximilian (7 July 1795 – 16 August 1875), married morganatically to Marie-Anne-Sophie Petin.

Maximilian&#x27;s second wife was Karoline of Baden, daughter of Margrave Karl Ludwig of Baden (13 July 1776 – 13 November 1841). They were married on 9 March 1797 in Karlsruhe. They had eight children, including two sets of twin girls, Elisabeth and Amalie born in 1801, and Sophie and Marie Anne born in 1805.
* Stillborn son (5 September 1799)
* Prince Maximilian Joseph Karl Friedrich (28 October 1800 – 12 February 1803), died in infancy.
* Princess Elisabeth Ludovika (&quot;Elise&quot;) (13 November 1801 – 14 December 1873) twin sister of Amalie Auguste. Married Frederick William IV of Prussia.
* Princess Amalie Auguste (13 November 1801 – 8 November 1877) twin sister of Elisabeth Ludovika. Married John I of Saxony.
* Princess Marie Anne Leopoldine (27 January 1805 – 13 September 1877) twin sister of Sophie. Married Frederick Augustus II of Saxony.
* Princess Sophie Friederike Dorothee (27 January 1805 – 28 May 1872) twin sister of Marie Anna. Married Archduke Franz Karl of Austria, mother of Franz Joseph I of Austria and Maximilian I of Mexico.
* Princess Ludovika Wilhelmine (30 August 1808 – 25 January 1892), married Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria, mother of Empress Elisabeth of Austria.
* Princess Maximiliana Josepha Karoline (21 July 1810 – 4 February 1821), died in childhood.

<doc id="295385" wikidata="Q1922297" url="?curid=295385" title="Mesa Airlines">
<text>Mesa Airlines, Inc. is an American regional airline headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona. Mesa operates and maintains aircraft used on flights that are scheduled, marketed and sold by United Airlines(as United Express. Mesa operates from 73 cities in the United States, Cuba and Mexico with an network of routes largely set up to connect passengers between smaller airports and United&#x27;s Houston–Intercontinental and Washington–Dulles hubs. In 2024, the company&#x27;s 1,992 employees operated an average of 279 flights per day.

== History ==

Mesa began operations as Mesa Air Shuttle in Farmington, New Mexico, in 1980. From 1989 through 1998, Mesa Airlines operated as a conglomeration of up to eight separate airlines. For the history of the acquisition and expansion of Mesa Airlines during this time see Mesa Air Group. The following history section details the history of the individual airlines that comprised Mesa Airlines during this time frame.

=== Mesa Airlines ===

The original Mesa Air Shuttle was a flight division of JB Aviation in Farmington, New Mexico, and operated a single route from Farmington to Albuquerque using a Piper Saratoga aircraft. In 1981 as the original Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) was discontinuing its flights between the two cities, Mesa obtained a twin-engine Piper Navajo Chieftain and increased service on the route. In 1982, the original owners sold the company to Larry and Janie Risley. The Risleys quickly expanded the carrier by acquiring a fleet of 14-passenger seat Beechcraft Model 99 commuter turboprops and adding service throughout New Mexico and surrounding states with a hub at Albuquerque. In 1985 larger 19-passenger seat Beechcraft 1900s were acquired which replaced the Beechcraft Model 99s and became the backbone of Mesa&#x27;s fleet. By 1987 up to 47 daily departures were operating from Albuquerque to 18 cities. Also in 1987, a Denver hub was created when Mesa acquired Centennial Airlines which operated several routes from Denver into Wyoming. After an initial route from Farmington and Gallup to Phoenix began in 1985, Phoenix was expanded into a hub in 1989 with new routes throughout Arizona. In 1990, most Denver flights were incorporated into the United Express division which Mesa had acquired from Aspen Airways. In 1992, when Mesa established a codeshare with America West Airlines, its Phoenix hub was turned over to the America West Express division. A minor hub was also operated at Farmington in the late 1980s with up to 22 daily flights connecting Albuquerque, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City to Durango, Cortez, and Telluride, CO. For a brief time in 1995 and 1996, the Mesa Airlines operation at Albuquerque, the United Express operation in Denver, and the America West Express operation in Phoenix were all known as operated by Mountain West Airlines. In 1997 and 1998, routes from Little Rock to Nashville and Wichita and from Nashville to Tupelo were added, first as Mesa Airlines, then later as US Airways Express.

In 1997, Mesa established a small hub at Fort Worth Meacham International Airport, using two Bombardier CRJ200 regional jet aircraft, providing service from Fort Worth to San Antonio, Austin, and Houston Hobby, as well as new routes from Colorado Springs to Nashville and San Antonio. The venture was short-lived and these routes were all eliminated during a corporate restructuring. The Albuquerque hub was merged into Air Midwest in 2001 but operated as a codeshare for Mesa Airlines until the hub was dissolved at the end of 2007.

In 1998, Mesa moved its headquarters from Farmington, NM to Phoenix, AZ.

====America West Express====

In September 1992, Mesa negotiated a code-sharing agreement with America West Airlines to operate as America West Express out of its Phoenix hub, serving 12 cities. These routes were originally from the independent Mesa operation and Several Beechcraft 1900D aircraft were painted in the America West Airlines scheme. The codeshare allowed increased frequency and increased load factors and expansion into several new markets.

In 1995, Mesa created a new subdivision called Desert Sun Airlines and acquired a pair of Fokker 70 jets for use on new America West Express routes from Phoenix to Des Moines and Spokane. Desert Sun was merged into the Mesa Airlines division in 1997 and its Fokker 70 aircraft were replaced by Bombardier CRJ200 regional jet aircraft. The CRJ-200 aircraft also began replacing the Beechcraft 1900D and Embraer EMB 120 turboprops. The Beechcraft 1900Ds were then transitioned over to Mesa&#x27;s Air Midwest subsidiary. Beginning in December 1997, Mesa began operating Dash 8-200 aircraft between Phoenix and Grand Junction followed by many other cities throughout Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. In 2003, Mesa Airlines took over the operations of Freedom Airlines and Freedom Airlines&#x27; CRJ900 regional jets were transferred into the America West Express operation. The Beechcraft 1900D flights operated by Air Midwest were discontinued on May 30, 2008.
On September 16, 2005, America West Airlines and US Airways completed their merger. Although the corporate side and operationally, those companies merged, as of May 2008, the two flight operations have not been merged and Mesa continues to code share with the new US Airways Group as US Airways Express under its America West Express codeshare agreement. It operated CRJ-200 and CRJ-900 aircraft from hubs in Charlotte and Phoenix, and Dash 8 aircraft from its Phoenix hub until late 2011, when during Mesa&#x27;s restructuring in bankruptcy, coinciding with United&#x27;s cancelation of any further CRJ200 service by Mesa, the CRJ200s and Dash 8s were removed from service. By early 2012, the only airframe Mesa uses for the &quot;west&quot; side of US Airways out of its Phoenix hub and the &quot;East&quot; side out of its Charlotte hub is with the CRJ900. 

====US Airways Express====
In November 1997, Mesa negotiated a codeshare agreement to provide service to US Airways as US Airways Express for 14 regional jets to various cities from its Philadelphia and Charlotte hubs. In 1998 and 2000, the agreement was expanded to 28 jets and then to 52 jets. The first CRJ200 aircraft began operating in 1998. As Mesa began taking deliveries of the Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft in 2000, the CRJs were transferred to the America West division, separating the fleet types.

In 2003, 20 CRJ200 aircraft were reintroduced to the US Airways Express division. With the reintroduction of the CRJ, the CRJ200 aircraft operated out of the Philadelphia hub, and the ERJ 145 aircraft operated out of the Charlotte hub.

In 2005, Mesa&#x27;s codeshare agreement with US Airways was not reaffirmed in bankruptcy court, and Mesa began transitioning the aircraft to other codeshares. Twenty-six ERJ aircraft were transitioned to Freedom Airlines, and the CRJ and remaining ERJs were transferred to Mesa&#x27;s United Express operation. However, following the America West Airlines merger later that year, the Mesa contract for America West Express was retained and expanded to include non-former America West Express routes. All US Airways Express flying was converted to American Eagle on October 17, 2015, when the merger between American and US Airways was completed.

==== American Eagle ====

As the merger process between American Airlines and US Airways was progressing, Mesa Airlines began operating as American Eagle on November 6, 2014, with routes out of the American Airlines hubs at Dallas/Fort Worth and Los Angeles using CRJ-900 aircraft. US Airways Express routes from Charlotte and Phoenix were gradually shifted to American Eagle until the transition and merger was completed on October 17, 2015.

As of December 17, 2022, American Eagle announced that they would part ways with Mesa Airlines due to financial troubles. In December 2022, Mesa announced that American Eagle flights would cease on April 3, 2023; Mesa cited losses stemming from utilization penalties and American Airlines&#x27; refusal to compensate Mesa for pilot wage increases it had enacted.

==== United Express ====
In 1990, Mesa acquired Aspen Airways Denver hub and routes, except for Aspen&#x27;s Denver to Aspen route. It attempted to acquire Aspen&#x27;s codeshare with United. However United was unwilling to codeshare with an airline that only operated 19-seat turboprops. Mesa leased Embraer EMB 120 aircraft from its former competitor in New Mexico, Air Midwest. With the Brasilias in hand, Mesa gained a codeshare with United for its Denver hub. Several Beechcraft 1300 and Beechcraft 1900 aircraft were repainted with the United Airlines scheme.

In 1995, California Pacific and its Los Angeles hub were merged into Mesa&#x27;s United Express operation. After the closing of Superior Airlines&#x27; Columbus hub, its aircraft and crews were used to expand United Express into Portland and Seattle. In 1997, operational difficulties with the Denver hub and disagreements over the renewal of Mesa&#x27;s WestAir subsidiary codeshare with United resulted in the cancellation of Mesa&#x27;s codeshare.

In 2003, Mesa agreed to a service agreement with United for service out of their hubs at Chicago-O&#x27;Hare, Denver, and Washington-Dulles under the United Express banner. In October 2009 United decided to exercise its early termination option for the Dash 8 flying. The Dash 8 flying ended on April 30, 2010. Around the same time, United decided not to extend its CRJ200 operation and as a result, all of the Mesa CRJ200s (26 aircraft) flying under United Express were phased out by April 30, 2010. As of 2015, Mesa&#x27;s United Express operations consisted of Embraer 175s flying out of the Houston hub and CRJ700s flying out of the Washington–Dulles hub.

In December 2022, Mesa executed an agreement with United to add up to 38 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, dependent on the number Embraer 175 aircraft Mesa still operated, starting in March 2023. Mesa would transfer its American Eagle crew and maintenance operations in Phoenix, Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso, and Louisville to United Express, and would open a new CRJ900 crew base in Houston and a pilot base in Denver. United agreed to compensate Mesa for the pilot wage increases it had enacted since September 2022, and agreed to buy 30 spare CRJ900 engines from Mesa for $80 million to increase Mesa&#x27;s cash reserves. United received a 10% ownership stake in Mesa and a seat on the Mesa board of directors.

===Skyway Airlines===
The Skyway Airlines division was Mesa&#x27;s first foray into the Midwest. Skyway was formed in 1989 when Mesa established a codeshare agreement with Midwest Express and a Milwaukee hub. From Milwaukee, Mesa served 25 cities in nine states in the upper Midwest region, using Beechcraft 1900 aircraft. Upon the expiration of the codeshare in 1994, it was not renewed. Midwest Express kept the Skyway Airlines name and routes, forming Astral Airways to fill the void as Mesa ceased service in Milwaukee. Mesa reallocated the aircraft and crews to start Superior Airlines in its Columbus hub for America West Express.

===FloridaGulf Airlines===

The FloridaGulf Airlines division was formed in 1991 after Mesa&#x27;s acquisition of Air Midwest. Air Midwest&#x27;s CEO, Robert Priddy, was chosen to start up the operation. It operated under a codeshare agreement with USAir and was a USAir Express carrier. It started with a Tampa hub, providing service to Florida and the southeast United States using Beechcraft 1900 aircraft. Additional hubs in Orlando and New Orleans were established. In 1993, the airline expanded into the Northeast, with a hub in Boston and eventually Philadelphia. In 1994, six Embraer EMB 120 aircraft were added. By the time it was merged into Air Midwest, in 1997, it was operating 44 Beechcraft 1900D and 9 Embraer EMB 120 aircraft serving 49 destinations.

===Superior Airlines===

After Midwest Express notified Mesa they would not be renewing the contract to operate their Skyway Airlines division, Mesa allocated the aircraft and crews to form Superior Airlines in 1994. Superior initially competed against their former Midwest Express partner as America West Express and also provided service from the new America West Columbus hub. Superior operated America West Express flights to compete against their former partner from Milwaukee to Flint, Lansing, Columbus, Grand Rapids, Indianapolis, Des Moines, and Cedar Rapids, as well as from Rockford to Detroit. Within 18 months Mesa redirected Superior and its Beechcraft 1900D fleet to focus exclusively on the Columbus hub. By 2000 the aircraft and crews, which consisted of CRJ200s (CL-65s), were being operated by Mesa Airlines itself. America West Airlines closed its Columbus hub in 2003 and Mesa again reallocated the assets this time to its newly reacquired United Express operation.

=== CalPac (California Pacific) ===
Mesa created CalPac (California Pacific) in 1992, establishing a second United Express carrier with a Los Angeles hub along with WestAir. It utilized Beechcraft 1900D and Embraer EMB 120 aircraft to serve 12 destinations. In 1995, the airline division was merged into Mesa&#x27;s United Express operation.

=== Liberty Express Airlines ===
In 1994, Mesa acquired Pittsburgh-based Crown Airways. Using the acquired assets, Mesa established Liberty Express with its hub in Pittsburgh and a codeshare with US Airways. In 1997, it was merged into Air Midwest, operating 14 Beechcraft 1900D aircraft serving 17 destinations.

=== Desert Sun Airlines ===
The Desert Sun Airlines division was created in 1995 to inaugurate Mesa&#x27;s first jet service utilizing Fokker 70 aircraft. It operated as America West Express from a Phoenix hub. The first two cities to receive jet service were Spokane and Des Moines. In 1996, the division was merged into Mesa&#x27;s America West Express operation, and the Fokker 70 aircraft were replaced by Bombardier CRJ aircraft as they were introduced. There was also a previous Desert Sun Airlines not affiliated with Mesa that operated scheduled passenger commuter service in southern California during the mid-1980s with Beechcraft 99 turboprops and Piper Chieftain prop aircraft.

=== go! ===
In 2006, Mesa formed go! in the Hawaiian Islands, using five Bombardier CRJ aircraft from its Honolulu hub. It established a code share with Mokulele Airlines, which served airports that cannot accept jet aircraft and provide point-to-point service in between the islands with Cessna Caravan turboprops. The codeshare with Mokulele was later replaced by one with Island Air, which was itself later replaced by a joint venture with Mokulele dubbed go! Mokulele. The airline ceased operations in Hawaii on April 1, 2014.

Mesa&#x27;s go! was involved in multiple lawsuits with Hawaiian Airlines and Aloha Airlines and was also investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration for an incident on February 13, 2008, where both pilots fell asleep during a regularly scheduled 36-minute flight between Honolulu and Hilo. go!&#x27;s flight 1002 overshot Hilo Airport by , remaining in the air as they missed the destination. Air traffic controllers were unable to reach the two pilots for 25 minutes, after which contact was re-established and the aircraft returned for a safe landing in Hilo.

Mesa&#x27;s go! was also blamed for the March 31, 2008 shutdown of Aloha Airlines due to &quot;predatory fares&quot;.

=== Kunpeng Airlines ===

Kunpeng Airlines was formed as a joint venture between Mesa Airlines and Shenzhen Airlines of China. They began flying in October 2007 with three Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft and currently have five in China . The airline originally expected to operate 20 CRJs prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and plan to expand at a rate of 20 aircraft per year for the next 5 years. All pilots would have been based in Beijing or Xi&#x27;an and the airline initially was to fly to 16 regional airports. Mesa intended to replace the outgoing CRJ200s with larger regional jets such as the CRJ700 and CRJ900. Kunpeng has recently decided to delay the delivery of CRJ200 in favor of brand new Embraer 190. All of the Mesa aircraft are being returned.

Furthermore, as of June 2009, Mesa no longer has a financial interest in Kunpeng Airlines, as Shenzhen Airlines purchased Mesa&#x27;s interest in the original joint venture.

== Controversies ==

=== Flight attendants ===

In February 2012 the contract between flight attendants and Mesa Airlines expired and became eligible for negotiation between the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) and Mesa.

Flight attendants have been at the core of Mesa&#x27;s operations since its agreements were reached with US Airways and their United Express operation were reached and for years before. Throughout the years many of them became frustrated with stagnant wages and non-competitive retention offerings leading to its current contract negotiations which began in 2012.

====After bankruptcy====
Negotiations had stalled several times in the years following 2012 in mediation and talks directly with the company after the company had only offered negligible pay increases, unaffordable health insurance, and significantly fewer incentives for flight attendants with longevity compared to other regional airlines.

In January 2017, contract negotiations in front of the National Mediation Board again came to a halt. The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), after over five years of failed negotiations, announced that the members of the union would be coming together for a strike vote in order to either accelerate negotiations or begin using the AFA&#x27;s patented method of striking – CHAOS – in order to interrupt operations with both American Airlines and United Airlines in anticipation that the two legacy carriers will place pressure on Mesa to offer livable wages and individual benefits comparable to other airlines.

On March 29, 2017, the AFA released a statement saying that Mesa Airlines Flight Attendants voted &quot;Yes&quot; to a strike vote overwhelmingly by a vote of 99.56%, the highest &quot;yes&quot; vote in at least 20 years for the AFA, and potentially in the history of the union since its founding in 1945.

In response Mesa Airlines CEO Jonathan Ornstein stated &quot;We&#x27;re going to continue to negotiate on good faith and come to an agreement that the company can afford&quot; and that it &quot;takes reasonableness on both parties.&quot;

Heather Stevenson, union president for Mesa, said &quot;We&#x27;re out of options&quot; as well as &quot;Five years of &#x27;Please&#x27; and &#x27;Thank you&#x27; and &#x27;Could you do better?&#x27; hasn&#x27;t done anything.&quot; She also stated &quot;...management can choose a different outcome by seriously negotiating a contract. Mesa Airlines is an important partner in the highly-profitable American Airlines and United Airlines networks.&quot;

&quot;Mesa Flight Attendants will not accept poverty wages&quot;, said Sara Nelson, international president of the AFA-CWA. &quot;Enough is enough. Mesa Flight Attendants have the full backing of the 50,000 members of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. We are ready to do whatever it takes to achieve a fair contract.&quot;

Mesa Airlines and the AFA returned to the bargaining table during the week of April 3, 2017. While the strike vote had the intended effect, the company still offered a negligible pay increase that would keep flight attendants to what they have calculated as &quot;Industry Average&quot;. However that number was only if both parties ignore all other regional competitors financial compensation that handle the same volume as Mesa.

On April 25, 2017, members of the AFA who were not employees of Mesa carried out informational protests in Chicago, Dallas, and Phoenix to educate the public about the union&#x27;s concerns such as low wages, poor health insurance, lack of progress on contract negotiations, as well as other actions of the company, and gain attention from American and United.

The AFA and Mesa Airlines met again during June 13–15 and again did not reach a resolution. The union stated &quot;it soon became apparent the Company was not prepared to reach a deal and saw no point in bargaining until after they knew the outcome of the pilots&#x27; vote which will be counted on July 12.&quot;

The AFA and Mesa Airlines reached a Tentative Agreement on August 14 and included these changes:
* Wage scale exceeding the average for Flight Attendants doing regional flights for United and American.
* Increased per diem.
* Block or better.
* Line guarantee and increased minimum guarantee.
* Long layover credit.
* 200% junior assignment pay.
* PBS on trial basis, strong language.
* Increased vacation for longevity.
* Improved commuter clause.
* &quot;Me too&quot; with pilot 401k.
* Increased deadhead pay.
* Jetbridge trades.
* Paid KCM.
* Four year duration with continued wage increases beyond the amendable date.

=== Pilots ===
On March 2, 2017, the Air Line Pilots Association, International union representing all of Mesa Airlines pilots filed a lawsuit after wages had stagnated and ceased to increase in any amount for almost ten years and the company had allegedly bypassed the Railway Labor Act by implementing bonus and incentive programs without reaching an agreement beforehand with the ALPA.

The goal of the pilots is similar to the at-the-time objective of the flight attendants, which is to be paid a standard and comparable wage to other regional airlines that can substantiate necessities such as food and shelter.

== Incidents ==
On June 29, 1990, flight 22, a Cessna 208 Caravan en route from El Paso, Texas, to Ruidoso, New Mexico, lost engine power and landed on New Mexico State Road 220 about four miles short of the Sierra Blanca Regional Airport. There were no injuries and the only visible damage was to the sheet metal on the right wingtip.

On October 16, 2001, an Embraer ERJ 145 was on final approach to Roanoke, Virginia. The captain had briefed a &quot;no go-around&quot; for a night visual approach to a &quot;Special Airport&quot;. The approach was not stabilized, and the airspeed decreased to the point of a stall. The airplane struck the runway in a nose high pitch attitude, the aft fuselage struck the runway first then settled on the landing gear. The first officer made initial call-outs of slow airspeed and then stopped when the captain failed to respond to her callouts. After landing, the airplane was taxied to the gate where a post-flight inspection limited to the main landing gear did not find the damage to the tail section. The incident was not reported by either pilot to the company and the airplane was allowed to be flown by the next crew the following morning on its scheduled service back to Charlotte, North Carolina, where a post flight inspection revealed the tail strike. When interviewed, the captain first denied having been involved in a hard landing and speculated that the tail strike must have been the result of an over rotation on takeoff from the morning crew. When faced with the CVR and FDR data, she eventually admitted to the incident. She reported that she briefed &quot;no go-around&quot; because no takeoffs were authorized on the runway at night or in IMC conditions; however, the first officer knew this was incorrect, but did not challenge the captain. Both pilots had received CRM training, which included crew member assertiveness, methods of fostering crew input, and situational awareness, and training on special use airports; however it was not followed by either pilot. The captain said the first officer was passive and quiet. The first officer reported the captain was defensive and did not take criticism very well. It is remarkable that the damage to the tail section was not discovered during the preflight visual inspection performed by the morning flight or ground crews. The aircraft had an MELed APU and needed the engines to be started with the assistance of an external air cart. The connection for the air cart is located at the aft bottom fuselage section where the damages were visible. The access panel was bent. Yet the ground crew did not notify the flight deck crew. When the walk-around visual inspection was performed by the morning crew&#x27;s first officer, it was performed during the hours of darkness with the help of a flashlight. The air cart was already connected and forced the first officer to walk around the cart and away from the aircraft, missing the tail strike damages. Both crews were terminated from employment; however, the first officer of the accident flight and the captain of the morning flight were eventually reinstated with help of their union (ALPA). The accident captain was able to recover her certificates and privileges but was not reinstated. The first officer from the morning crew died from illness prior to being reinstated.

On February 13, 2008, the pilots of a go! Bombardier CRJ200 fell asleep and overshot their destination airport by before air traffic control was able to make contact with the aircraft. The incident happened on the third consecutive day during which the pilots had been required to start duty at 05:40 am. The captain suffered from an undiagnosed severe sleep apnea. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause of this incident as follows: &quot;The captain and first officer inadvertently falling asleep during the cruise phase of flight. Contributing to the incident were the captain&#x27;s undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and the flight crew&#x27;s recent work schedules, which included several consecutive days of early-morning start times.&quot;

On September 29, 2015, American Airlines Flight 5786, which was operated by Mesa Airlines under the American Eagle brand, encountered a wing strike during landing on a day with calm winds. The plane landed and taxied to the gate without further incident. No injuries were reported.

On January 11, 2019, American Eagle Flight 5766, en route from Dallas-Fort Worth, slid off the runway after landing in icy and snowy conditions. The Bombardier CRJ900 was the first flight to attempt to land at Columbia Municipal Airport after the ground crew cleared the runway of ice and snow. Reports state the runway was still very slick with ice.

<text>Air Midwest, Inc., was a Federal Aviation Administration Part 121 certificated air carrier that operated under air carrier certificate number AMWA510A issued on May 15, 1965. It was headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, United States, and from 1991 was a subsidiary of Mesa Air Group. Besides initially flying as an independent air carrier, it later operated code sharing feeder flights on behalf of Eastern Air Lines as Eastern Air Midwest Express, on behalf of American Airlines as American Eagle, on behalf of Trans World Airlines (TWA) as Trans World Express and on behalf of US Airways as US Airways Express. It also operated feeder flights on behalf of Braniff (1983–1990) and Ozark Air Lines in addition to flying for Mesa Airlines. Air Midwest was shut down by its parent company, Mesa Airlines, in June 2008.

==History==
Air Midwest was incorporated in Wichita, Kansas, on May 7, 1965 by Gary Adamson as Aviation Services Inc. Using a single Cessna 206, Adamson transported human remains for area mortuaries. Later, Aviation Services held out for charter and on April 17, 1967 began scheduled service flying between Wichita and Salina.

As Frontier Airlines downsized from the western Kansas market beginning in 1968, Aviation Services moved in to assume air service. In 1969, it changed its name to Air Midwest and ordered Beech 99 commuter turboprop aircraft to keep up with its expansion. In 1971, Frontier withdrew all service from Dodge City, Great Bend, and Hutchinson, KS allowing Air Midwest to assume service. In 1977, Frontier withdrew all service at Garden City, Goodland, and Hays, KS as well as Lamar, CO and Air Midwest began operating a fleet of six Swearingen Metroliner commuter propjets. By then Air Midwest was linking smaller cities throughout Kansas to Wichita, Kansas City, MO, and Denver, CO. 

With airline deregulation in late 1978 Air Midwest saw many more expansion opportunities and made a bold move by ordering ten more Metroliners. On March 1, 1979, Air Midwest began operating several new routes in New Mexico formerly flown by Texas International Airlines. This new service to New Mexico was connected to the Kansas operations by serving 
Lubbock, Texas where Air Midwest partnered with Braniff Airways. From Lubbock, service was started to Hobbs, Roswell, Carlsbad, and Albuquerque, New Mexico as well as from Albuquerque to Clovis, NM. Service was also started from Lubbock, to Garden City, Dodge City, and Wichita, Kansas. In July 1979, service was inaugurated from Lubbock and Wichita, to Ponca City, Enid, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1980/1981 Air Midwest again expanded with new routes from Albuquerque to Alamogordo, Silver City, and Farmington, New Mexico as well as from Farmington to Phoenix, Arizona all formerly flown by the original Frontier Airlines (1950-1986). A new link to Wichita was also created via Clovis and Amarillo. Routes were also expanded from both the Kansas City International Airport and the Kansas City Downtown Airport to new cities in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Oklahoma. In 1982 all Lubbock service was discontinued and transferred to Midland/Odessa, Texas until 1984 when all Midland/Odessa service ended. In 1983 a marketing agreement was established with Frontier Airlines in which all Air Midwest flights at Denver would feed Frontier. Beginning in 1984, competitor Mesa Airlines began aggressive expansion throughout New Mexico and Texas and Air Midwest made the decision to discontinue all routes in this area on January 31, 1986. They then shifted their focus to building newly acquired code share relationships with major airlines listed below. Also in 1984, Air Midwest was independently operating nonstop flights from St. Louis Downtown Airport (CPS) to Chicago Midway Airport (MDW), Kansas City Downtown Airport (MKC), and Olathe, KS (via Johnson County Industrial Airport (LXT)) with Metro propjets.

On May 1, 1985, Air Midwest merged with Scheduled Skyways, a Fayetteville, Arkansas-based commuter air carrier which later changed its name to Skyways, in hopes of gaining a codeshare to feed Republic Airlines&#x27; Memphis hub. Air Midwest would expand by acquiring routes in Arkansas to complement its existing routes in the midwest. Both carriers operated Metro propjets, and Air Midwest had an opportunity to win a codeshare agreement with Republic. However, Republic then picked a different air carrier to feed its Memphis hub. Meanwhile, Air Midwest subsequently discovered many hidden problems with the neglected fleet inherited from Scheduled Skyways, forcing the airline to perform a great deal of maintenance to keep the aircraft flying. The merger with Scheduled Skyways pushed Air Midwest to the verge of bankruptcy over the few years that followed.

On April 1, 1985, Air Midwest introduced the 30-seat Saab 340 turboprop aircraft with flights from Kansas City to Wichita, Omaha, and Manhattan, KS. By the end of 1985 the airline was operating five Saab 340&#x27;s and 24 Metroliners.

Although Air Midwest was unsuccessful in gaining a codeshare with Republic through the Scheduled Skyways merger, it was able to acquire codeshare agreements in 1985 with Eastern Airlines as Eastern Air Midwest Express at the Kansas City and Wichita hubs and in 1986 with Ozark Air Lines as Ozark Midwest at that carriers&#x27; St. Louis hub, as well as with American Airlines as part of the American Eagle (airline brand) at their newly created Nashville hub.

Continuing money problems forced Air Midwest to sell its Nashville hub and Saab 340 aircraft to American in 1987. Trans World Airlines (TWA) acquired Ozark Air Lines in 1986 and forced Air Midwest to surrender some of its St Louis routes because TWA already had a code share partner in St Louis, Resort Air (later Trans States Airlines). At the end of 1989, Air Midwest was operating Trans World Express service on behalf of TWA at its St. Louis hub with nonstop flights to Birmingham, AL; Bloomington, IL; Cape Girardeau, MO; Cedar Rapids, IA; Champaign, IL; Decatur, IL; Evansville, IN; Fayetteville, AR; Fort Leonard Wood, MO; Knoxville, TN; Lexington, KY; Marion, IL; Paducah, KY; Quincy, IL; Rochester, MN; South Bend, IN; Topeka, KS and Waterloo, IA operated with Jetstream 31, Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia, Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner and Saab 340 turboprops. By 1990, the airline had added Trans World Express service between St. Louis and Fort Smith, AR; Manhattan, KS and Salina, KS.

By June 1988, Air Midwest had built up the Kansas City hub with 89 flights per day to 20 cities, all operating as Eastern Express. Eastern then abruptly downsized its Kansas City hub operation thus leaving Air Midwest with no one to connect passenger traffic to. Air Midwest quickly negotiated a codeshare agreement with the second incarnation of Braniff (1983-1990), as Braniff was now building up Kansas City as a hub. The Braniff Express operation took over by October 1, 1988, however, just over one year later, Braniff once again went into bankruptcy and suspended operations on November 6, 1989.

After the collapse of Braniff, Air Midwest went back to operating under their own branding at Kansas City until yet another new codeshare agreement was negotiated, this time with USAir to feed their small Kansas City hub as USAir Express beginning on January 15, 1991. USAir changed its name to US Airways in 1997 and the US Airways Express operation at Kansas City continued until June 30, 2008.

Mesa Airlines began attempts to purchase Air Midwest in 1989. It succeeded in 1991 and replaced the Air Midwest metroliner fleet with newly acquired Beechcraft 1900D aircraft. In 2001 all Mesa Airlines flights operating with Beech 1900D&#x27;s at the Albuquerque and Phoenix hubs were transferred to the Air Midwest certificate.

A book on the history of Air Midwest entitled &quot;Pioneer of the Third Level&quot; was written by Dr. Imre E. Quastler, an authority on regional airlines. This book thoroughly covers the early years of Air Midwest from 1965 through 1980.

===Operations under Mesa Air Group===
Mesa Air Group acquired Air Midwest in 1991.
From 1991 until 1997, Air Midwest operated twelve Beechcraft 1900C commuter turboprops flying from its Kansas City hub as USAir Express. In 1997, Mesa Air Group underwent a corporate reorganization: Mesa Airline&#x27;s FloridaGulf, Liberty Express, and Independent divisions were merged into Air Midwest.

Air Midwest operated to many smaller cities for Essential Air Service including an America West Express operation in Phoenix and Las Vegas under an agreement with America West Airlines. Also independent operations were run as &quot;Mesa Airlines&quot; brand with divisions out of Albuquerque, Chicago, and Dallas/Fort Worth. The America West Express operation was transferred to US Airways Express with the merger of America West and US Airways in 2007. Air Midwest further operated as US Airways Express at the major carriers&#x27; hubs in Charlotte, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh and with smaller operations at Omaha, Little Rock, and New Orleans.

On January 8, 2003, Air Midwest had its first fatal accident when Air Midwest Flight 5481 operating as US Airways Express and departing out of Charlotte for Greenville-Spartanburg crashed 37 seconds after takeoff. All 19 passengers and two crewmembers were killed in the accident.

For a period of three weeks in August 2006, Air Midwest operated as Delta Connection, flying three Beechcraft 1900D from John F. Kennedy Airport to Providence, Rhode Island, and Windsor Locks, Connecticut, as a stop-gap measure for Freedom Airlines, another subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, until it was relieved by Chautauqua Airlines.

On February 1, 2007, Air Midwest began operations at Chicago Midway International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, to three Illinois airports: Decatur, Marion, and Quincy. However, just nine months after beginning this service, Mesa Airlines announced that Air Midwest would end all service from Illinois on November 9, 2007.

In May 2007, Air Midwest, operating as America West Express on behalf of America West Airlines, requested that the FAA allow it to withdraw service from the regional airport in Vernal, Utah, (a service that had started only one year prior) as soon as a replacement carrier was approved. On Oct. 4, 2007, the federal Department of Transportation announced that Great Lakes Airlines would replace Air Midwest as the Essential Air Service carrier at the Utah airports in Vernal and Moab. At the same time, the Department of Transportation announced that SkyWest Airlines would replace Air Midwest as the Essential Air Service carrier at Cedar City.

A report published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on January 14, 2008, included a statement from Mesa CEO Jonathan G. Ornstein that the company had decided to shut down Air Midwest, citing significant losses stemming from increased maintenance and fuel costs. All cities served by Air Midwest received notices of intention to end service, except for Prescott and Kingman, Arizona. Mesa later announced plans to completely shut down the Air Midwest subsidiary, with all services to be terminated by June 30, 2008. At the time of its shutdown, there were 20 airplanes in service, down from a high of 118.

The last two flights flown by Air Midwest were Flights 4679 and Flights 4681. Both departed on June 30, 2008, at 10:40pm from Kansas City International (MCI) to Joplin, Missouri (flt. 4679) and Columbia, Missouri (flt. 4681).

==MesaMax==

MesaMax applied to Mesa Airlines flights that were operated by Air Midwest. It consisted of a card, upon which flights were recorded with a stamp. Once 16 stamps had been recorded, the card could have been redeemed for a single round-trip ticket on Mesa Airlines flights.

<text>The Lazarus Effect (1983) is the third science fiction novel set in the by the American author Frank Herbert and poet Bill Ransom. It takes place some time after the events in &quot;The Jesus Incident&quot; (1979).

==Plot summary==
An indeterminate but several hundreds of years after &quot;The Jesus Incident&quot; the intelligent kelp has been almost totally destroyed, almost all land on Pandora has been submerged, and humanity has divided into two cultures: Islanders and Mermen. Islanders live on floating islands, the smallest of which houses at least 10,000 people, and which like much of Islander technology are living creatures. Islanders are genetically unstable due to the clone and genetic experiments of Jesus Lewis. Some are nearly like modern day humans, but diversity is wide and accepted. Islander children who have mutations that are considered dangerous are executed soon after birth. Mermen, who are genetically stable and are much like modern day humans apart from webbed hands and feet, live in underwater cities with better technology, better food, advanced medicine, and an all around higher quality of life than the Islanders. They perform experiments aimed at bringing back the intelligent kelp and rocketry to gain access to the hibernation tanks on Ship (the intelligent ship which humans created in &quot;Destination: Void&quot; and which originally brought the humans to Pandora).

Without kelp acting to control currents, nearly teenage nearly-standard-human Islander Brett is lost overboard when the island he is on is struck by a rogue wave. He is rescued by Scudi Wang, a female Merman around his age, and taken to her home underwater. Due to being the heiress to a large Merman company controlling vital interests like food production and transport, Scudi has become the interest of GeLaar Gallow who wants to co-opt her resources into his insurgency. Gallow, and his terrorist commando subordinates calling themselves Green Dashers (due to them painting their dive suits green as camouflage and after the vicious predator the Hooded Dasher), plan to take control of the hibernation tanks when they arrive from orbit with fauna from Earth as well as humans from the past. Part of Gallow&#x27;s plan involves gaining access to Vata, the human-kelp hybrid (conceived during the previous novel) who has been dreaming since the death of the kelp and who is under Islander control. He destroyed one of the small floating cities as well as kidnapped Ward Keel, a high ranking Islander who is the Chief Justice in charge of executing or not Islander neonates considered too mutated to be safe to live, in order to pressure the release of Vata into his care.

When Scudi and Brett escape they are pursued by Gallow&#x27;s commandoes. Due to intervention by Brett&#x27;s employer, Queets Twisp, who has been looking for them, as well as Islander Bushka who has become mentally unstable (due to guilt over being forced at gunpoint to pilot the submarine that destroyed the island and killed thousands), and the kelp, which has again become sentient, and hylighters (giant hydrogen-filled airship-like creatures which are vectors of the kelp that disseminate kelp seeds which have not been seen for centuries) Gallow&#x27;s conspirators are eliminated, some killed by the kelp invading their hydrofoil boat and dragging the conspirators to drown.

The kelp, identifying itself as Avata, communicates with Scudi, Brett and several assorted characters. The hibernation tanks fall and release many creatures including humpback whales. Avata, in the form of hylighters, brings old style humans release from untold centuries or millennia of hybernation to the protagonists boat and thence to small regions of dry land the Merman have created and which will be more stable now that the kelp has awakened and is able to control sea currents. Vata who mysteriously escaped from Islander care is revealed to sleep in the kelp and Ward Keel, who died due to organ failure, is revealed to have had his consciousness absorbed by the kelp as happens to all people whose bodies are placed in kelp when they die.

==Major themes==
The book deals with concepts such as artificial intelligence, worship, ecology, and the inherent problems of totalitarianism. It also addresses the issues of clones, genetic engineering and racism.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Lazarus Effect&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #50, and stated that &quot;Not top-class Herbert - dunno about Ransom - but far better than its predecessor.&quot;

<text>Cleopatra VI Tryphaena (, ) or Cleopatra Tryphaena II (died c. 57 BC) was a queen of Ptolemaic Egypt who ruled alongside Berenice IV, who was either her sister or daughter.

Although called &quot;Cleopatra VI Tryphaena&quot; by some modern historians, she may be identical with Cleopatra V, the known mother of Berenice IV and wife of pharaoh Ptolemy XII Auletes. Or Cleopatra VI could have been a daughter of Ptolemy XII Auletes and thus older sibling of Berenice IV, Cleopatra VII, Ptolemy XIII, and Ptolemy XIV. After co-ruling Egypt for a year, Cleopatra VI died of unknown causes in 57 BC, after which Ptolemy XII Auletes returned to Egypt with Roman military aid to overthrow his rival daughter Berenice IV in 55 BC.

==Historical context==
In 59 BC Julius Caesar was one of the consuls of Rome. It was believed that the annexation of Egypt was part of his own political programme, the excuse being that the king of Egypt, Ptolemy XII Auletes, was illegitimate and had no right to rule. Ptolemy however bought Caesar&#x27;s support at huge expense, and the Romans passed a law to recognise Ptolemy Auletes as legitimate king of Egypt. The treaty however said nothing about Cyprus, where another Ptolemy, the brother of Ptolemy Auletes, was king. 

In 58 BC the Romans annexed Cyprus, and the deposed king committed suicide. The loss of Cyprus, and the poor state of the Egyptian economy following the bribes to Caesar, triggered civil unrest in Ptolemy Auletes&#x27; capital Alexandria. Unable to quash the unrest on his own, Ptolemy Auletes went in 58 BC to Rome to ask for military support, leaving his family behind in Egypt. In his absence, the Alexandrines declared him deposed, and in his place nominated his daughter Berenice IV Epiphaneia and (according to the ancient historian Porphyry) &quot;[Auletes&#x27;] eldest daughter&quot; Cleopatra VI Tryphaena as joint monarchs.

Unable to muster up immediate support from the Romans, Ptolemy Auletes was initially unable take his kingdom back from the two queens. From 58 BC till the end of 57 BC he resided in Rome or at Pompey&#x27;s villa in the Alban hills, busily working upon the senators by bribes or promises, and procuring the assassination of envoys sent from Alexandria to Rome; he then left Rome and went to Ephesus, and lived in the sacred precinct of Artemis. In the meantime Cleopatra Tryphaena is believed to have died in 57 BC of unknown causes, leaving the young Berenice sole queen in Alexandria for another two years. In the spring of 55 BC Ptolemy and a Roman force invaded Egypt. Berenice was defeated, and Ptolemy Auletes was installed once more as king in Alexandria by the Romans. One of Ptolemy Auletes&#x27; first acts after his restoration was to execute his daughter Berenice, for the crime of usurping his throne. 

==Familial relationship of Cleopatra VI to the Ptolemaic Dynasty==
The identity of Cleopatra VI Tryphaena or rather her familial relationship to Ptolemy XII Auletes and Berenice IV Epiphaneia, is far from clear. Reconstructing a family tree for the later generations of her family, the Ptolemaic Dynasty, cannot be accomplished with any certainty. Records for the Ptolemies of this period are far from complete, often fragmentary, and sometimes contradictory, and those attesting to the existence of Cleopatra VI Tryphaena are particularly limited. Only one source, the account of Porphyry quoted above, explicitly records Berenice IV as co-ruling with a queen named Cleopatra Tryphaena, and only Porphyry, in that same account, records Ptolemy XII Auletes as having a daughter named Cleopatra Tryphaena.

If Porphyry is correct, it is likely Cleopatra VI Tryphaena was the daughter of Ptolemy XII Auletes by his wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena. As such, Cleopatra VI Tryphaena would have been an older sister of the famous Cleopatra VII, and her birth year would be c. 75 BC. Porphyry&#x27;s account is however flatly contradicted by Strabo, who reports Ptolemy XII Auletes only had three daughters: these can reliably be identified as Berenice IV, Cleopatra VII, and Arsinoe IV, leaving no room for Cleopatra VI. 

Other historians suggest Cleopatra VI Tryphaena may be identical with Cleopatra V Tryphaena, the only recorded wife of Ptolemy XII Auletes. Cleopatra V Tryphaena was Queen consort of Egypt from her marriage to Ptolemy in 79 BC until her mysterious disappearance from the records in 69 BC. Some historians believe her disappearance in 69 BC was due to her death. However, a dedication on the Temple of Edfu from December 5, 57 BC reads, &quot;Ptolemy, Young Osiris, with his Sister, queen Cleopatra, surnamed Tryphaena.&quot; The king is Ptolemy XII (who however was not present in Egypt at that time). The &quot;Cleopatra Tryphaena&quot; named by the inscription would be the king&#x27;s wife rather than daughter, and it is unlikely the name would appear had Ptolemy XII&#x27;s wife already died twelve years earlier. If Cleopatra V was indeed still alive in 57 BC, and in view of the account by Strabo that Ptolemy XII Auletes had only three daughters, some historians think it most likely that Berenice IV&#x27;s co-queen was her mother, Cleopatra V Tryphaena, rather than (as Porphyry has it) an otherwise unattested sister.

<text>Earrings are jewelry that can be worn on one&#x27;s ears. Earrings are commonly worn with an earlobe piercing or another external part of the ear, or by some other means, such as stickers or clip-ons. Earrings have been worn across multiple civilizations and historic periods, often carrying a cultural significance.

Locations for piercings other than the earlobe include the rook, tragus, and across the helix (see image in the infobox). The simple term &quot;ear piercing&quot; usually refers to an earlobe piercing, whereas piercings in the upper part of the external ear are often referred to as &quot;cartilage piercings&quot;. Cartilage piercings are more complex to perform than earlobe piercings and take longer to heal.

Earring components may be made of any number of materials, including metal, plastic, glass, precious stone, beads, wood, bone, and other materials. Designs range from small hoops and studs to large plates and dangling items. The size is ultimately limited by the physical capacity of the earlobe to hold the earring without tearing. However, heavy earrings worn over extended periods of time can lead to ear stretching and the piercing.

Ear piercing is one of the oldest known forms of body modification, with artistic and written references from cultures around the world dating back to early history. Gold earrings, along with other jewelry made of gold, lapis lazuli, and carnelian were found in the ancient sites in Lothal, India, and Sumerian Royal Cemetery at Ur from the Early Dynastic period. Gold, silver and bronze hoop earrings were prevalent in the Minoan Civilization (2000–1600 BCE) and examples can be seen on frescoes on the Aegean island of Santorini, Greece. During the late Minoan and early Mycenaean periods of Bronze Age Greece hoop earrings with conical pendants were fashionable. Early evidence of earrings worn by men can be seen in archeological evidence from Persepolis in ancient Persia. The carved images of soldiers of the Persian Empire, displayed on some of the surviving walls of the palace, show them wearing an earring.

Howard Carter writes in his description of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb that the Pharaoh&#x27;s earlobes were perforated, but no earrings were found inside the wrappings, although the tomb contained some. The burial mask&#x27;s ears were perforated as well, but the holes were covered with golden discs. This implies that at the time, earrings were only worn in Egypt by children, much like in Egypt of Carter&#x27;s times.

Other early evidence of earring-wearing is evident in the Biblical record. In Exodus 32:1–4, it is written that while Moses was up on Mount Sinai, the Israelites demanded that Aaron make a god for them. It is written that he commanded them to bring their sons&#x27; and daughters&#x27; earrings (and other pieces of jewelry) to him in order that he might comply with their demand (). By the classical period, including in the Middle East, as a general rule, they were considered exclusively female ornaments. During certain periods in Greece and Rome also, earrings were worn mainly by women, though they were popular among men in early periods and had resurfaced later on, as famous figures like Plato were known to have worn them.

The practice of wearing earrings was a tradition for Ainu men and women, but the Government of Meiji Japan forbade Ainu men to wear earrings in the late-19th century. Earrings were also commonplace among nomadic Turkic tribes and Korea. Lavish ear ornaments have remained popular in India from ancient times to the present day. And it was common that men and women wear earrings during Silla, Goryeo to Joseon.

In Western Europe, earrings became fashionable among English courtiers and gentlemen in the sixteenth century during the English Renaissance. Revealing of attitudes at the time, and commenting on the degeneracy of his contemporaries, Holinshed in his Chronicle (1577) observes: &quot;Some lusty courtiers and gentlemen of courage do wear either rings of gold, stones or pearls in their ears, whereby they imagine the workmanship of God to be not a little amended.&quot; Among sailors, a pierced earlobe was a symbol that the wearer had sailed around the world or had crossed the equator.

By the late 1950s or early 1960s, the practice re-emerged in the Western world. Teenage girls were known to hold &quot;ear-piercing parties&quot;, where they performed the procedure on one another. By the mid-1960s, some physicians offered ear piercing as a service. Simultaneously, Manhattan jewelry stores were some of the earliest commercial, non-medical locations for having one&#x27;s ears pierced.

In the late 1960s, ear piercing began to make inroads among men through the hippie and gay communities, although they had been popular among sailors for decades (or longer).

By the early 1970s, ear piercing was common among women, thus creating a broader market for the procedure. Department stores throughout the USA would hold ear piercing events, sponsored by earring manufacturers. At these events, a nurse or other trained person would perform the procedure, either pushing a sharpened and sterilized &quot;starter earring&quot; through the earlobe by hand, or using an ear-piercing instrument modified from the design used by physicians.

In the late 1970s, amateur piercings, sometimes with safety pins or multiple piercings, became popular in the punk rock community. By the 1980s, the trend for male popular music performers to have pierced ears helped establish a fashion trend for men. This was later adopted by many professional athletes. British men started piercing both ears in the 1980s; George Michael of Wham! was a prominent example. As of now, it is widely acceptable for teenage and pre-teen boys to have both ears pierced as well simply as a fashion statement. 
Multiple piercings in one or both ears first emerged in mainstream America in the 1970s. Initially, the trend was for women to wear a second set of earrings in the earlobes, or for men to double-pierce a single earlobe. Asymmetric styles with more and more piercings became popular, eventually leading to the cartilage piercing trend. Double ear piercing in newborn babies is a phenomenon in Central America, particularly in Costa Rica.

A variety of specialized cartilage piercings have since become popular. These include the tragus piercing, antitragus piercing, rook piercing, industrial piercing, helix piercing, orbital piercing, daith piercing, and conch piercing. In addition, earlobe stretching, while common in indigenous cultures for thousands of years, began to appear in Western society in the 1990s, and is now fairly common. However, these forms of ear piercing are still infrequent compared to standard ear piercing.

===Religious===
According to Hindu dharma tradition, most girls and some boys (especially the &quot;twice-born&quot;) get their ears pierced as part of a Dharmic rite known as Karnavedha before they are about five years old. Infants may get their ears pierced as early as several days after their birth.

Similar customs are practiced in other Asian countries, including Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Laos, although traditionally most males wait to get their ears pierced until they have reached young adulthood.

Ear piercing is mentioned in the Bible in several contexts. The most familiar refers to a Hebrew slave who was to be freed in the seventh year of servitude but wishes to continue serving his master and refuses to go free: &quot;…his master shall take him before God. He shall be brought to the door or the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall then remain his slave for life&quot; (Exodus 21:6).

==Types of earrings==

===Modern standard pierced earrings===

====Barbell earrings====
Barbell earrings get their name from their resemblance to a barbell, generally coming in the form of a metal bar with an orb on either end. One of these orbs is affixed in place, while the other can be detached to allow the barbell to be inserted into a piercing. Several variations on this basic design exist, including barbells with curves or angles in the bar of the earring.

====Claw earrings====
The claw, talon or pincher is essentially a curved taper which is worn in stretched ear lobe piercings. The thickest end is generally flared and may be decorated, and a rubber o-ring may also be used to prevent the talon from becoming dislodged when worn. Common materials include acrylic and glass. A similar item of jewelry is the crescent, or pincher, which as the name suggests, is shaped like a crescent moon and is tapered at both ends. Talons and claws may also be quite ornamental (e.g.: carved in the form of a serpent or dragon). Consequently, they may prove to be an impractical choice of jewelry as they may snag on hair, clothing, etc.

====Statement earrings====

Statement earrings can be defined as &quot;earrings which invite attention from others by demonstrating bold, original, and unique designs with innovative construction and material combinations&quot;. They include one or more of the following design features:
*Dangles
*Tassels
*Sparkles
*Bold or striking colours
*Hoops

====Stud/minimal earrings====
The main characteristic of a stud earring is the appearance of floating on the ear or earlobe without a visible (from the front) point of connection. A stud earring features a gemstone or other ornament mounted on a narrow post that passes straight through a piercing in the ear or earlobe, which is held in place behind the ear by means of a removable friction back or clutch (sometimes referred to as a &quot;butterfly&quot; or scroll fitting). To prevent their loss, the posts of some more expensive stud earrings made of precious metals or containing precious stones, such as solitaire diamonds, are threaded, allowing a &quot;screw back&quot; to hold the stud securely in place.

====Heart earrings====

Heart earrings are earrings in the form of the heart. They can be in the normal wearing degree and also they can be in a rotation of 180° wearing degree.

====Hoop earrings====

Hoop earrings are circular or semi-circular in design and look very similar to a ring. Hoop earrings generally come in the form of a hoop of metal that can be opened to pass through the ear piercing. They are often constructed of metal tubing, with a thin wire attachment penetrating the ear. The hollow tubing is permanently attached to the wire at the front of the ear, and slips into the tube at the back. The entire device is held together by tension between the wire and the tube. Other hoop designs do not complete the circle, but penetrate through the ear in a post, using the same attachment techniques that apply to stud earrings. A variation is the &quot;continuous hoop earring&quot;. In this design, the earring is constructed of a continuous piece of solid metal, which penetrates through the ear and can be rotated almost 360°. One of the ends is permanently attached to a small piece of metallic tubing or a hollow metallic bead. The other end is inserted into the tubing or bead, and is held in place by tension. One special type of hoop earring is the &quot;sleeper earring&quot;, a circular wire normally made of gold, with a diameter of approximately one centimeter. &quot;Hinged&quot; sleepers, which were common in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, comprise two semi-circular gold wires connected via a tiny hinge at one end, and fastened via a small clasp at the other, to form a continuous hoop whose fastening mechanism is effectively invisible to the naked eye. Because their small size makes them unobtrusive and comfortable, and because they are normally otherwise unadorned, &quot;sleepers&quot; are so-called because they were intended to be worn at night to keep a pierced ear from closing, and were often the choice for the first set of earrings immediately following the ear piercing in the decades before ear-piercing guns using studs became commonplace, but are often a fashion choice in themselves because of their attractive simplicity and because they subtly call attention to the fact that the ear is pierced.

====Drop earrings====

A drop earring attaches to the earlobe and features a gemstone or ornament that dangles down from a chain, hoop, or similar object. The length of these ornaments vary from the very short to the extravagantly long. Such earrings are occasionally known as droplet earrings, dangle earrings, or pendant earrings. They also include chandelier earrings, which branch out into elaborate, multi-level pendants.

====Chandelier earrings====

Chandelier earrings have an appearance similar to that of chandeliers, with a design that dangles below the ear and is wider at the base than the top.

====Dangle earrings====

Dangle earrings (also known as drop earrings) are designed to suspend from the bottoms of the earlobes. Their lengths vary from a centimeter or two, all the way to brushing the wearer&#x27;s shoulders. A pierced dangle earring is generally attached to the ear with a thin wire passing through the earlobe. It may connect to itself with a small hook at the back, or in the &quot;French hook&quot; design, the wire passes through the earlobe piercing without closure, although small plastic or silicone retainers are sometimes used on ends. Rarely, dangle earrings use the post attachment design. There are also variants that attach without piercing.

====Huggy earrings====
Huggy earrings are hoops that closely follow the curve of the earlobe, instead of dangling down beneath it as in regular hoop earrings. Commonly, stones are channel set in huggy earrings.

====Ear thread====
Ear thread, or earthreader, ear string, or threader earrings, are a chain that is thin enough to slip into the ear hole, dangling down at the back. Sometimes, people add beads or other materials onto the chain, so the chain dangles with beads below the ear.

====Jhumka earrings====
A type of dangling bell-shaped traditional earrings mostly worn by women of Indian subcontinent.
A jhumki is a traditional earring commonly worn in South Asia, especially in India and Pakistan. It features a bell-shaped design and is usually crafted from metals such as gold, silver, or brass, often adorned with detailed patterns and gemstones.

===Body piercing jewelry used as earrings===

Body piercing jewelry is often used for ear piercings, and is selected for a variety of reasons including the availability of larger gauges, better piercing techniques, and a reduced risk of healing complications.
* Captive bead rings – Captive bead rings, often abbreviated as CBRs and sometimes called &quot;ball closure rings&quot;, are a style of body piercing jewelry that is an almost 360° ring with a small gap for insertion through the ear. The gap is closed with a small bead that is held in place by the ring&#x27;s tension. Larger gauge ball closure rings exhibit considerable tension, and may require ring expanding pliers for insertion and removal of the bead.
* Barbells – Barbells are composed of a thin, straight metal rod with a bead permanently fixed to one end. The other end is threaded, either externally or tapped with an internal thread, and the other bead is screwed into place after the barbell is inserted through the ear. Since the threads on externally threaded barbells tend to irritate the piercing, internal threads have become the most common variety. Another variation are threadless barbells or press-fit jewelry, with a hollow post, a fixed back disk and a front end that is attached with a slightly bend pin that is inserted into the post. 
* Circular barbells – Circular barbells are similar to ball-closure rings, except that they have a larger gap, and have a permanently attached bead at one end, and a threaded bead at the other, like barbells. This allows for much easier insertion and removal than with ball closure rings, but at the loss of a continuous look.
* Plugs – Earplugs are short cylindrical pieces of jewelry. Some plugs have flared ends to hold them in place, others require small elastic rubber rings (O-rings) to keep them from falling out. They are usually used in large-gauge piercings.
* Flesh tunnels – Flesh tunnels, also known as eyelets or bullet holes, are similar to plugs; however, they are hollow in the middle. Flesh tunnels are most commonly used in larger gauge piercings either because weight is a concern to the wearer or for aesthetic reasons.

====Gauges and other measuring systems====
For an explanation of how earring sizes are denoted, see the article Body jewelry sizes.

===Clip-on and other non-pierced earrings===


Several varieties of non-pierced earrings exist.

* Clip-on earrings – Clip-on earrings have existed longer than any other variety of non-pierced earrings. The clip itself is a two-part piece attached to the back of an earring. The two pieces closed around the earlobe, using mechanical pressure to hold the earring in place.
* Magnetic earrings – Magnetic earrings simulate the look of a (pierced) stud earring by attaching to the earlobe with a magnetic back that hold the earring in place on by magnetic force.
* Stick-on earrings – Stick-on earrings are adhesive-backed items which stick to the skin of the earlobe and simulate the look of a (pierced) stud earring. They are considered a novelty item.
* Spring hoop earrings – Spring hoops are almost indistinguishable from standard hoop earrings and stay in place by means of spring force.
** An alternative which is often used is bending a wire or even just using the ring portion of a CBR to put on the earlobe, which stays on by pinching the ear
* Ear hook earrings – A large hook like the fish hook that is big enough to hook and hang over the whole ear and dangles.
* The hoop – A hoop threads over the ear and hangs from just inside the ear, above where ears are pierced. Mobiles or other dangles can be hung from the hoop to create a variety of styles.
* Ear screws – Screwed onto the lobe, allow for exact adjustment—an alternative for those who find clips too painful.
* – Wrap around the outer cartilage (similar to a conch piercing) and may be chained to a lobe piercing.

===Permanent earrings===
Where most earrings worn in the western world are designed to be removed easily to be changed at will, earrings can also be permanent (non-removable). They were once used as a mark of slavery or ownership. They appear today in the form of larger gauge rings which are difficult or impossible for a person to remove without assistance. Occasionally, hoop earrings are permanently installed by the use of solder, though this poses some risks due to toxicity of metals used in soldering and the risk of burns from the heat involved. Besides permanent installations, locking earrings are occasionally worn due to their personal symbolism or erotic value.

==Ear piercing==
Pierced ears are earlobes or the cartilage portion of the external ears which have had one or more holes or &quot;piercings&quot; created in them for the wearing of earrings. Piercings become permanent when the tract around the starter earring epithelializes during the healing period following the initial piercing, and are sometimes mischaracterised as a fistula. The piercings do not form fully if the starter earrings are removed prematurely, or if earrings are not worn in the piercings for a longer period, depending on the recency with which the ear was pierced.

===Conch piercing===
A conch piercing is a perforation of the part of the external human ear called the &quot;concha&quot;, the hollow next to the ear canal, for the purpose of inserting and wearing jewelry. Conch piercings have become popular among young women in recent decades as part of a trend for multiple ear piercings.

===Helix piercing===
The helix piercing is a perforation of the helix or upper ear cartilage for the purpose of inserting and wearing a piece of jewelry. The piercing itself is usually made with a small gauge hollow piercing needle, and typical jewelry would be a small diameter captive bead ring, or a stud.

Sometimes, two helix piercings hold the same piece of jewelry, usually a barbell, which is called an industrial piercing.

Like any other cartilage piercing, helix piercings may be painful to receive, and bumping or tugging on them by accident during healing can cause irritation. When they are left alone and not being irritated or touched, there is typically no discomfort. Piercers recommended avoiding unnecessary touching of helix piercings during healing, which can take 6 to 9 months.

=== Snug piercing===
A snug (or antihelix) piercing is a piercing which passes through the anti-helix of the ear from the medial to lateral surfaces.

===Spiral piercing===

An ear spiral is a thick spiral that is usually worn through the earlobe. It is worn in ears that have been stretched and normally held in place only by its own downward pressure. Glass ear spirals are shown but many materials are used. Some designs are quite ornate and may include decorative appendages flaring from the underlying concentric pattern.

===Piercing techniques===
A variety of techniques are used to pierce ears, ranging from &quot;do it yourself&quot; methods using household items to medically sterile methods using specialized equipment.

A long-standing home method involves using ice as a local anesthetic, a sewing needle, a burning match or rubbing alcohol for disinfection, and a semi-soft object, such as a potato, cork, bar of soap, or rubber eraser, to hold the ear in place. Sewing thread may be drawn through the piercing and tied, as a device for keeping the piercing open during the healing process. Alternatively, a gold stud or wire earring may be directly inserted into the fresh piercing as the initial retaining device. Home methods are often unsafe and risky owing to improper sterilization and poor placement.

Another method for piercing ears, introduced in the 1960s, was the use of sharpened spring-loaded earrings known as &quot;self-piercers,&quot; &quot;trainers,&quot; or &quot;sleepers,&quot; which gradually pushed through the earlobe. However, these could easily slip from their initial placement position, often resulting in considerable discomfort, and often would not penetrate fully through the earlobe without additional pressure being applied. This method fell into disuse owing to the popularity of faster and more successful piercing techniques.


Ear-piercing instruments, sometimes called &quot;ear-piercing guns&quot;, were originally developed for physicians&#x27; use, but became widely used in retail settings. Today more and more people in the Western world have their ears pierced with an ear-piercing instrument in specialty jewellery or accessory stores, in beauty salons and in pharmacies; however, some choose to do it at home using disposable ear-piercing kits. An earlobe piercing performed with an ear-piercing instrument is often described as feeling similar to being pinched, or being snapped by a rubber band. Piercing with this method, especially for cartilage piercings, is not recommended by many piercing professionals, as it is claimed by some to cause blunt-force trauma to the skin, and that it takes longer to heal than needle piercing. In addition, the external housing of most ear-piercing instruments is made of plastic, which cannot be sterilized in an Autoclave, potentially increasing the risk of infection. Piercing the cartilage of the ear with an ear-piercing instrument has been known to shatter the cartilage and lead to more serious complications.

An alternative method that has been growing in popularity since the 1990s is the use of the same hollow piercing needles that are used in body piercing. Some piercers may use a forceps or clamp to hold the earlobe during the piercing, while others pierce the ear freehand. After the desired placement of the piercing has been marked, the piercer positions the needle tip at the desired place and angle, and quickly pushes the needle fully through the earlobe. Immediately after the piercing, a cork can be placed on the needle tip behind the earlobe; if a cannula has been used, the needle is withdrawn, leaving the plastic sheath in place through the new piercing. Depending on the type of starting earring the client has selected, the piercer then inserts the jewellery into the end of the needle or cannula sheath, and guides it through the new piercing either forwards or backwards, and finally attaches either a clasp (for a standard earring post) or labret stud (if a flatback labret has been used). The piercer then disinfects the newly pierced lobe again. Once the piercing has been completed, the used needles and cannulas are then disposed of.

Regardless of whether their ear piercing is to be performed with an ear-piercing instrument or a needle, the client will first select their desired piercing jewellery, sign any consent forms, and is usually seated so that the piercer is able perform the piercing with ease. Ear-piercing practitioners normally disinfect the earlobe with alcohol prior to piercing, and mark the intended point of piercing, providing the client the opportunity to confirm that the position is correct, or to have the mark repositioned. Once the client agrees upon the intended placement of the piercing on the ear, the piercing is usually completed within a few minutes.

In tribal cultures and among some neo-primitive body-piercing enthusiasts, piercings are performed using other tools, such as animal or plant organics.

Initial healing time for an earlobe piercing is typically six to eight weeks. Subsequently, earrings can be changed, but if the piercing is left open for an extended period of time, there is some risk that it may close, requiring re-piercing. Piercing professionals recommend wearing earrings in newly pierced ears continuously for at least six months, and sometimes up to a year. Cartilage piercings require more healing time (up two to three times as long) than earlobe piercings. Even after fully healing, earlobe piercings tend to shrink in the prolonged absence of earrings, and may in some cases close.

===Health risks===
The health risks with conventional earlobe piercing are common but tend to be minor, particularly if proper technique and hygienic procedures are followed. One study found that up to 35 percent of persons with pierced ears had one or more complications, including minor infection (77 percent of pierced ear sites with complications), allergic reaction (43 percent), keloids (2.5 percent), and traumatic tearing (2.5 percent). Pierced ears are a significant risk factor for contact allergies to the nickel in jewelry. Earlobe tearing during the healing period or after healing is complete can be minimized by not wearing earrings, especially wire-based dangle earrings, during activities in which they are likely to become snagged, such as while playing sports. Also, larger gauge jewelry will lessen the chance of the earring being torn out.

With cartilage piercing, the blunt force of an ear piercing instrument will traumatize the cartilage, and therefore make healing more difficult. Also, because there is substantially less blood flow in ear cartilage than in the earlobe, infection is a much more serious issue. There have been several documented cases of severe infections of the upper ear following piercing with an ear piercing instrument, which required courses of antibiotics to clear up. There are many ways that an infection can occur: the most common way is when the person that got pierced decides to take out the piercing too early. According to the A.M.A. the proper waiting period to change or take out a piercing with substantially less risk of infection would be three weeks.

For all ear piercings, the use of a sterilized hollow piercing needle tends to minimize the trauma to the tissue and minimize the chances of contracting a bacterial infection during the procedure. As with any invasive procedure, there is always a risk of infection from blood borne pathogens such as hepatitis and HIV. However, modern piercing techniques make this risk extremely small (the risk being greater to the piercer than to the pierced due to the potential splash-back of blood). There has never been a documented case of HIV transmission due to ear/body piercing or tattooing, although there have been instances of the Hepatitis B virus being transmitted through these practices.

====Research into the negative effects of wearing earrings====
The most frequent complications connected with wearing earrings are:

* inflammation
* keloids
* loss of tissue by tearing 
* mechanical division of earlobes
* potential skin disorder

Researchers observed a correlation between the piercing of young girls&#x27; earlobes and subsequent development of allergies.

In Professor Ewa Czarnobilska&#x27;s view (the manager of the research team) the main reason of allergy (listed by allergists) is presence of nickel as a component of alloys used in the production of earrings – however the ingredients declared by producer are not significant, because nickel is a standard component of jewellery.

Symptoms of allergy are visible as eczema. This symptom is often justified to be food allergy (e.g. to milk), meanwhile the reason is contact with the earring (precisely nickel ions) with the lymphatic system.

The cessation of wearing earrings by children does not result in the vanishing of allergy symptoms. The immune system remembers the presence of nickel ions that existed in someone&#x27;s blood and lymph. Even though the children ceased wearing earrings, it can appear as an allergic reaction to:

* metal parts of wardrobe
* dental braces
* dental prosthesis
* orthotics
* meals cooked in pots with addition of nickel
* margarine (nickel is a catalyst in hydrogenation of unsaturated fats)
* coins
* chocolate
* nuts
* leguminous vegetables
* wine
* beer

Research studying a sample of 428 pupils, age seven and eight, and sixteen and seventeen noticed that:

* thirty percent of population were allergic to nickel
* allergy occurred for many girls who had started wearing earrings in early childhood

Other symptoms of allergy to nickel are:

* recurring infections
* asthma attacks
* chronic larynxis

<doc id="295401" wikidata="Q941967" url="?curid=295401" title="Peniche, Portugal">
<text>Peniche () is a seaside municipality and a city in the Oeste region, in the historical province of Estremadura, and in the Leiria District. It has 26,431 inhabitants, in an area of 77.55 km2. The city itself has a population of about 15,600 inhabitants.
The present mayor is Henrique Bertino, elected by the independent coalition GCEPP (&quot;Grupo de Cidadãos Eleitores por Peniche&quot;; Electors for Peniche Group of Citizens). The idiomatic expression &quot;Friend from Peniche&quot;, used to describe someone who wants to receive things at the expense of other without giving anything in return, comes from here.

==History and landmarks==
The city was built on a rocky peninsula which is considered by geologists a unique example of the Toarcian turnover during the worldwide Early Jurassic extinction.

Peniche is known for its long beaches, which are popular for recreational activities and sports such as surfing, windsurfing, bodyboarding and kite surfing. These beaches are consistently windy and have good surf breaks with &quot;Supertubos&quot;, i.e., waves forming fast and powerful tubes, considered among the best in Europe. The area has been called the &quot;European Pipeline&quot;, after the Banzai Pipeline in Hawaii.

Peniche Fortress is a notable example of Portuguese coastal defences. During the 20th-century period of authoritarian rule known as the Estado Novo, or Second Republic, it was used as a prison for communists and other opponents of the regime.

The Berlengas islands, about offshore from the peninsula, are part of the municipality. They form one of the world&#x27;s first nature reserves. In summer, the islands can be visited by taking a ferryboat from Peniche.

Peniche, with its scenic harbour, white windmills, chapels and long sandy beaches has inspired famous artists like Maurice Boitel.

==Climate==
Peniche has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;) greatly moderated by the Atlantic Ocean, with mild wet winters and cool dry summers. Its low diurnal temperature variation and little seasonal temperature variation make it remarkably mild year-round.
It has a climate very similar to that of San Francisco, California only with warmer nights mainly due to the effects of the Portugal Current.

Despite its latitude in central Portugal, the city has one of the mildest winter night-time temperatures in mainland Europe.

==Economy==
Since ancient times Peniche has been an important fishing harbour. Besides fisheries, the economy of the Peniche municipality relies on agriculture, services and tourism.

Two versions of the AW-Energy WaveRoller have been tested about 800 m off the coast of Peniche, in 2012 and 2019–2021. This device sits on the seabed and harnesses wave power from the surging motion of nearshore waves, feeding power into the local electricity grid.

==Education==
Besides schools for primary, secondary and vocational education, Peniche is home to a state-run polytechnic school of the &quot;Instituto Politécnico de Leiria&quot;, which through its &quot;Escola Superior de Turismo e Tecnologia do Mar de Peniche&quot;, awards academic degrees in marine technologies and tourism.

==Parishes==
Administratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):
* Atouguia da Baleia
* Ferrel
* Peniche
* Serra d&#x27;El-Rei
==Surfing==
Peniche is one of the best surfing locations in Europe. It has beaches and breaks facing three distinctly different directions, making it a consistent destination for surfers. Home to many surf camps/schools, it annually hosts the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal from the World championship tour of the World Surf League (WSL) at the Supertubos beach.

==Sports==
The football club of the city is called Grupo Desportivo de Peniche.

Peniche Amigos Clube is known nationally for their Triathlon and Futsal teams.

Clube Stella Maris is known nationally for their basketball and badminton teams. The club gives the population a pavilion which hosts many sport-related events.

The city annually hosts the &quot;Triatlo de Peniche&quot;, which unites the Portuguese Cup and the National Universities Championships with the historical event, the first ever in Portugal.

The best-known athletes from Peniche are Telma Santos, who has participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro; Silvano Lourenço, the European bodyboarding champion in 2007; and Victoria Kaminskaya who participated in the swimming competitions of the 2016 Summer Olympics.

== Notable people ==
* Antônio Ferreira Viçoso (1787-1875) a Portuguese Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop of Mariana, 1843-1875 
* Ricardo Costa (1940–2021) a Portuguese film director.
* Albertino João Santos Pereira (1967–2010) stage name &quot;Beto&quot;, a Portuguese singer.
* Carlos Leitão (born 1959), Canadian economist and politician
* Telma Santos (born 1983) a Portuguese badminton player, competed at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics

<doc id="295402" wikidata="Q229411" url="?curid=295402" title="Delhi Sultanate">
<text>The Delhi Sultanate or the Sultanate of Delhi was a late medieval empire primarily based in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for more than three centuries. The sultanate was established around in the former Ghurid territories in India. The sultanate&#x27;s history is generally divided into five periods: Mamluk (1206–1290), Khalji (1290–1320), Tughlaq (1320–1414), Sayyid (1414–1451), and Lodi (1451–1526). It covered large swaths of territory in modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, as well as some parts of southern Nepal.

The foundation of the Sultanate was established by the Ghurid conqueror Muhammad Ghori, who routed the Rajput Confederacy, led by Ajmer ruler Prithviraj Chauhan, in 1192 near Tarain in a reversal of an earlier battle. As a successor to the Ghurid dynasty, the Delhi Sultanate was originally one of several principalities ruled by the Turkic slave-generals of Muhammad Ghori, including Taj al-Din Yildiz, Qutb ud-Din Aibak, Bahauddin Tughril and Nasir ad-Din Qabacha, that had inherited and divided the Ghurid territories amongst themselves. Khalji and Tughlaq rule ushered a new wave of rapid and continual Muslim conquests deep into South India. The sultanate finally reached the peak of its geographical reach during the Tughlaq dynasty, occupying most of the Indian subcontinent under Muhammad bin Tughluq. A major political transformation occurred across North India, triggered by the Central Asian king Timur&#x27;s devastating raid on Delhi in 1398, followed soon afterwards by the re-emergence of rival Hindu powers such as Vijayanagara Empire and Kingdom of Mewar asserting independence, and new Muslim sultanates such as the Bengal and Bahmani Sultanates breaking off. In 1526, Timurid ruler Babur invaded northern India and conquered the Sultanate, leading to its succession by the Mughal Empire.

The establishment of the Sultanate drew the Indian subcontinent more closely into international and multicultural Islamic social and economic networks, as seen concretely in the development of the Hindustani language and Indo-Islamic architecture. It was also one of the few powers to repel attacks by the Mongols (from the Chagatai Khanate) and saw the enthronement of one of the few female rulers in Islamic history, Razia Sultana, who reigned from 1236 to 1240. During the sultanate&#x27;s rule, there was no mass forcible conversion of Hindus, Buddhists, and other dharmic faiths, and Hindu officials and vassals were readily accepted. However, there were cases like Bakhtiyar Khalji&#x27;s annexations, which involved a large-scale desecration of Hindu and Buddhist temples and the destruction of universities and libraries. Mongolian raids on West and Central Asia set the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, intelligentsia, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from those regions into the subcontinent, thereby establishing Islamic culture there.

==Name==
Although conventionally named after its principal capital city, Delhi, the terminology applied to domains under Delhi Sultanate was often unspecified. It was called as &quot;Empire of Delhi&quot; &quot;(Persian: Mamalik-i-Delhi)&quot; by Juzjani and Barani while Ibn Battuta called the empire under Muhammad bin Tughlaq as &quot;Hind and Sind&quot;. The Delhi Sultanate was also known as the &quot;Empire of Hindustan&quot; &quot;(Persian: Mamalik-i-Hindustan)&quot;, a name that gained currency during the period.

==History==

===Background===

The rise of the Delhi Sultanate in India was part of a wider trend affecting much of the Asian continent, including the whole of southern and western Asia: the influx of nomadic Turkic peoples from the Central Asian steppes. This can be traced back to the 9th century when the Islamic Caliphate began fragmenting in the Middle East, where Muslim rulers in rival states began enslaving non-Muslim nomadic Turks from the Central Asian steppes and raising many of them to become loyal army slaves called Mamluks. Soon, Turks were migrating to Muslim lands and becoming Islamicized. Many of the Turkic Mamluk slaves eventually rose to become rulers and conquered large parts of the Muslim world, establishing Mamluk Sultanates from Egypt to present-day Afghanistan, before turning their attention to the Indian subcontinent.
It is also part of a longer trend predating the spread of Islam. Like other settled, agrarian societies in history, those in the Indian subcontinent have been attacked by nomadic tribes throughout its long history. In evaluating the impact of Islam on the subcontinent, one must note that the northwestern subcontinent was a frequent target of tribes raiding from Central Asia in the pre-Islamic era. In that sense, the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions were not dissimilar to those of the earlier invasions during the 1st millennium.

By 962 AD, Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms in South Asia faced a series of raids from Muslim armies from Central Asia. Among them was Mahmud of Ghazni, the son of a Turkic Mamluk military slave, who raided and plundered kingdoms in northern India from east of the Indus river to west of the Yamuna river seventeen times between 997 and 1030. Mahmud of Ghazni raided the treasuries but retreated each time, only extending Islamic rule into western Punjab.

The series of raids on northern and western Indian kingdoms by Muslim warlords continued after Mahmud of Ghazni. The raids did not establish or extend the permanent boundaries of the Islamic kingdoms. In contrast, the Ghurid Sultan Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din Muhammad Ghori (commonly known as Muhammad of Ghor) began a systematic war of expansion into northern India in 1173. He sought to carve out a principality for himself and expand the Islamic world. Muhammad of Ghor created a Sunni Islamic kingdom of his own extending east of the Indus river, and he thus laid the foundation for the Muslim kingdom called the Delhi Sultanate. Some historians chronicle the Delhi Sultanate from 1192 due to the presence and geographical claims of Muhammad Ghori in South Asia by that time.

Muhammad Ghori was assassinated in 1206, by Ismāʿīlī Shia Muslims. After the assassination, one of Ghori&#x27;s slaves (or Mamluks), the Turkic Qutb al-Din Aibak, assumed power, becoming the first Sultan of Delhi.

===Dynasties===
==== Mamluk dynasty (1206–1290)====
Qutb al-Din Aibak, a former slave of Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din Muhammad Ghori, was the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. Aibak was of Turkic Cuman-Kipchak origin, and due to his lineage, his dynasty is known as the Mamluk dynasty. Aibak reigned as the Sultan of Delhi for four years, from 1206 to 1210. Aibak was praised by the contemporary and later accounts for his generosity and due to this was called with the sobriquet of &quot;Lakhbaksh&quot;. (giver of lakhs)

After Aibak died, Aram Shah assumed power in 1210, but he was assassinated in 1211 by Aibak&#x27;s son-in-law, Shams ud-Din Iltutmish. Iltutmish&#x27;s power was precarious, and several Muslim amirs (nobles) challenged his authority as they had been supporters of Qutb al-Din Aibak. After a series of conquests and brutal executions of opposition, Iltutmish consolidated his power.

His rule was challenged several times, such as by Qubacha, and this led to a series of wars. Iltutmish conquered Multan and Bengal from contesting Muslim rulers, as well as Ranthambore and Sivalik from the Hindu rulers. He also attacked, defeated, executed Taj al-Din Yildiz, who asserted his rights as heir to Mu&#x27;izz ad-Din Muhammad Ghori. Iltutmish&#x27;s rule lasted until 1236. Following his death, the Delhi Sultanate saw a succession of weak rulers, disputing Muslim nobility, assassinations, and short-lived tenures. Power shifted from Rukn ud-Din Firuz to Razia Sultana and others, until Ghiyas ud-Din Balban came to power and ruled from 1266 to 1287. Ghiyasuddin Balban destroyed the power of the Corps of Forty, a council of 40 Turkic slaves who had played a role as kingmakers and had been independent of the Sultan. He was succeeded by 17-year-old Muiz ud-Din Qaiqabad, who appointed Jalal ud-Din Firuz Khalji as the commander of the army. Khalji assassinated Qaiqabad and assumed power in the Khalji Revolution, thus ending the Mamluk dynasty and starting the Khalji dynasty.

Qutb al-Din Aibak initiated the construction of the Qutb Minar but died before it was completed. It was later completed by his son-in-law, Iltutmish. The Quwwat-ul-Islam (Might of Islam) Mosque was built by Aibak, now a UNESCO world heritage site. The Qutub Minar Complex was expanded by Iltutmish, and later by Ala ud-Din Khalji in the early 14th century. During the Mamluk dynasty, many nobles from Afghanistan and Persia migrated and settled in India, as West Asia came under Mongol siege.

==== Khalji dynasty (1290–1320)====

The Khalji dynasty was of Turko-Afghan heritage. They were originally Turkic, but due to their long presence in Afghanistan, they were treated by others as Afghan as they adopted Afghan habits and customs.

The first ruler of the Khalji dynasty was Jalal ud-Din Firuz Khalji. He was around 70 years old at the time of his ascension and was known as a mild-mannered, humble and kind monarch to the general public. Jalal ud-Din Firuz ruled for 6 years before he was murdered in 1296 by Muhammad Salim of Samana, on the orders of his nephew and son-in-law Juna Muhammad Khalji, who later came to be known as Ala ud-Din Khalji.

Ala ud-Din began his military career as governor of Kara province, from where he led two raids on the Kingdom of Malwa (1292) and Devagiri (1294) for plunder and loot. After he acceded to the throne, expansions towards these kingdoms were renewed including Gujarat which was conquered by the Grand Vizier Nusrat Khan Jalesari, the kingdom of Malwa by Ainul Mulk Multani, as well as Rajputana. However, these victories were cut short because of Mongol attacks and plunder raids from the northwest. The Mongols withdrew after plundering and stopped raiding northwest parts of the Delhi Sultanate.

After the Mongols withdrew, Ala ud-Din Khalji continued to expand the Delhi Sultanate into southern India with the help of Indian slave generals such as Malik Kafur and Khusro Khan. They collected much war booty (anwatan) from those they defeated. His commanders collected war spoils and paid ghanima (Arabic: الْغَنيمَة, a tax on spoils of war), which helped strengthen the Khalji rule. Among the spoils was the Warangal loot that included the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond.

Ala ud-Din Khalji changed tax policies, raising agriculture taxes from 20% to 50% (payable in grain and agricultural produce), eliminating payments and commissions on taxes collected by local chiefs, banning socialization among his officials as well as inter-marriage between noble families to help prevent any opposition forming against him, and he cut salaries of officials, poets, scholars. These tax policies and spending controls strengthened his treasury to pay the keep of his growing army; he also introduced price controls on all agricultural produce and goods in the kingdom, as well as controls on where, how, by whom these goods could be sold. Markets called &quot;shahana-i-mandi&quot; were created. Muslim merchants were granted exclusive permits and monopoly in these &quot;mandis&quot; to buy and resell at official prices. No one other than these merchants could buy from farmers or sell in cities. Those found violating these &quot;mandi&quot; rules were severely punished, often by mutilation. Taxes collected in the form of grain were stored in the kingdom&#x27;s storage. During famines that followed, these granaries ensured sufficient food for the army.
Historians note Ala ud-Din Khalji as being a tyrant. Anyone Ala ud-Din suspected of being a threat to this power was killed along with the men, women, and children of that family. He grew to eventually distrust the majority of his nobles and favoured only a handful of his slaves and family. In 1298, between 15,000 and 30,000 Mongols near Delhi, who had recently converted to Islam, were slaughtered in a single day, due to a mutiny during an invasion of Gujarat. He is also known for his cruelty against kingdoms he defeated in battle.

After Ala ud-Din died in 1316 by assassination through his nobles, his general Malik Kafur, who was born to a Hindu family but converted to Islam, assumed de facto power and was supported by non-Khalji nobles like Kamal al-Din Gurg. However, he lacked the support of the majority of Khalji&#x27;s nobles who had him assassinated, hoping to take power for themselves. However, the new ruler had the killers of Kafur executed.

The last Khalji ruler was Ala ud-Din Khalji&#x27;s 18-year-old son Qutb ud-Din Mubarak Shah Khalji, who ruled for four years before he was killed by Khusro Khan, another slave-general with Hindu origins, who reverted from Islam and favoured his Hindu Baradu military clan in the nobility. Khusro Khan&#x27;s reign lasted only a few months, when Ghazi Malik, later to be called Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq, defeated and killed him and assumed power in 1320, thus ending the Khalji dynasty and starting the Tughlaq dynasty.

====Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1413)====
The Tughlaq dynasty was a Turko-Mongol or Turkic Muslim dynasty, which lasted from 1320 to 1413. The first ruler was Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq. Ghiyath al-Din ruled for five years and built a town near Delhi named Tughlaqabad. His son Juna Khan and general Ainul Mulk Multani conquered Warangal in south India. According to some historians such as Vincent Smith, he was killed by his son Juna Khan, who then assumed power in 1325.

Juna Khan renamed himself as Muhammad bin Tughlaq and ruled for 26 years. During his rule, the Delhi Sultanate reached its peak in terms of geographical reach, covering most of the Indian subcontinent.

Muhammad bin Tughlaq was an intellectual, with extensive knowledge of the Quran, Fiqh, poetry and other fields. He was also deeply suspicious of his kinsmen and wazirs (ministers), extremely severe with his opponents, and took decisions that caused economic upheaval. For example, he ordered the minting of coins from base metals with face value of silver coins – a decision that failed because ordinary people minted counterfeit coins from base metal they had in their houses and used them to pay taxes and jizya.
Muhammad bin Tughlaq chose the city of Deogiri in the present-day Indian state of Maharashtra (renaming it Daulatabad), as the second administrative capital of the Delhi Sultanate. He ordered a forced migration of the Muslim population of Delhi, including his royal family, the nobles, Syeds, Sheikhs and &#x27;Ulema to settle in Daulatabad. The purpose of transferring the entire Muslim elite to Daulatabad was to enrol them in his mission of world conquest. He saw their role as propagandists who would adapt Islamic religious symbolism to the rhetoric of empire, and that the Sufis could by persuasion bring many of the inhabitants of the Deccan to become Muslim. Tughluq cruelly punished the nobles who were unwilling to move to Daulatabad seeing their non-compliance with his order as equivalent to rebellion. According to Ferishta, when the Mongols arrived in Punjab, the Sultan returned the elite to Delhi, although Daulatabad remained an administrative centre. One result of the transfer of the elite to Daulatabad was the hatred of the nobility to the Sultan, which remained in their minds for a long time. The other result was that he managed to create a stable Muslim elite and result in the growth of the Muslim population of Daulatabad who did not return to Delhi, without which the rise of the Bahmanid kingdom to challenge the Vijayanagara kingdom would not have been possible. Muhammad bin Tughlaq&#x27;s adventures in the Deccan region also marked campaigns of destruction and desecration temples, for example, the Svayambhu Shiva Temple and the Thousand Pillar Temple in Warangal.

Revolts against Muhammad bin Tughlaq began in 1327, continued over his reign, and over time the geographical reach of the Sultanate shrunk. The Vijayanagara Empire originated in southern India as a direct response to attacks from the Delhi Sultanate, and liberated south India from the Delhi Sultanate&#x27;s rule. In the 1330s, Muhammad bin Tughlaq ordered an invasion of China, sending part of his forces over the Himalayas. However, they were defeated by the Kangra State. During his reign, state revenues collapsed from his policies such as the base metal coins from 1329 to 1332. Famines, widespread poverty, and rebellion grew across the kingdom. In 1338 his nephew rebelled in Malwa, whom he attacked, caught, flayed alive, and killed ultimately. By 1339, the eastern regions under local Muslim governors and southern parts led by Hindu kings had revolted and declared independence from the Delhi Sultanate. Muhammad bin Tughlaq did not have the resources or support to respond to the shrinking kingdom. The historian Walford chronicled that Delhi and most of India faced severe famines during Muhammad bin Tughlaq&#x27;s rule in the years after the base metal coin experiment. In 1335, Jalaluddin Ahsan Khan, a Sayyid native of Kaithal in North India, revolted and founded the Madurai Sultanate in South India. By 1347, the Bahmani Sultanate had become independent through the rebellion of Ismail Mukh. It became a competing Muslim kingdom in the Deccan region of South Asia, founded by Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah.

Muhammad bin Tughlaq died in 1351 while trying to chase and punish people in Gujarat who were rebelling against the Delhi Sultanate. He was succeeded by Firuz Shah Tughlaq (1351–1388), who tried to regain the old kingdom, boundary by waging a war with Bengal for 11 months in 1359. However, Bengal did not fall. Firuz Shah ruled for 37 years. His reign was marked with prosperity much of which was due to the wise and capable Grand Vizier, Khan-i-Jahan Maqbul, a South Indian Telugu Muslim. His reign attempted to stabilize the food supply and reduce famines by commissioning an irrigation canal from the Yamuna river. An educated sultan, Firuz Shah left a memoir. In it he wrote that he banned the practice of torture, such as amputations, tearing out of eyes, sawing people alive, crushing people&#x27;s bones as punishment, pouring molten lead into throats, setting people on fire, driving nails into hands and feet, among others. He also wrote that he did not tolerate attempts by Rafawiz Shia Muslim and Mahdi sects from proselytizing people into their faith, nor did he tolerate Hindus who tried to rebuild temples that his armies had destroyed. Firuz Shah Tughlaq also lists his accomplishments to include converting Hindus to Sunni Islam by announcing an exemption from taxes and jizya for those who convert, and by lavishing new converts with presents and honours. He also vastly expanded the number of slaves in his service and those of Muslim nobles, who were converted to Islam, taught to read and memorize the Quran, and employed in many offices especially in the military, out of which he was able to amass a large army. These slaves were known as the Ghulaman-i-Firuz Shahi formed an elite guard which later became influential in the state. The reign of Firuz Shah Tughlaq was marked by reduction in extreme forms of torture, elimination of favours to select parts of society, but also increased intolerance and persecution of targeted groups, the latter of which resulting in conversion of significant parts of the population to Islam.
The death of Firuz Shah Tughlaq created anarchy and disintegration of the kingdom. Firuz Shah&#x27;s successor, Ghiyath-ud-Din Shah II was young and inexperienced and gave himself up to wine and pleasure. The nobles rose against him killed the Sultan and his vizier, and installed Abu Bakr Shah on the throne. However, the old Ghulaman-i-Firuz Shahi turned against Abu Bakr, who fled, and on their invitation Nasir-ud-Din Muhammad Shah was installed on the throne. The anamalous institution of the Ghulaman-i-Firuz Shahi became a corrupting influence on the successive Sultans following Firuz Shah. The last rulers of this dynasty both called themselves Sultan from 1394 to 1397: Nasir ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughlaq, the grandson of Firuz Shah Tughlaq who ruled from Delhi, and Nasir ud-Din Nusrat Shah Tughlaq, another relative of Firuz Shah Tughlaq who ruled from Firozabad, which was a few miles from Delhi. The battle between the two relatives continued until Timur&#x27;s invasion in 1398. Timur, also known as Tamerlane in Western scholarly literature, was the Turkicized Mongol ruler of the Timurid Empire. He became aware of the weakness and quarrelling of the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate, so he marched with his army to Delhi, plundering and killing all the way. Estimates for the massacre by Timur in Delhi range from 100,000 to 200,000 people. Timur had no intention of staying in or ruling India. He looted the lands he crossed, then plundered and burnt Delhi. Over fifteen days, Timur and his army raged a massacre. Then he collected wealth, captured women and men and children, and enslaved people (particularly skilled artisans), and returning with this loot to Samarkand. The people and lands within the Delhi Sultanate were left in a state of anarchy, chaos, and pestilence. Nasir ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughlaq, who had fled to Gujarat during Timur&#x27;s invasion, returned and nominally ruled as the last ruler of the Tughlaq dynasty, as a puppet of the various factions at the court.

====Sayyid dynasty (1414–1450)====
The Sayyid dynasty was founded by Khizr Khan and it ruled the Delhi Sultanate from 1415 to 1451. Members of the dynasty derived their title, Sayyid, or the descendants of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, based on the claim that they belonged to his lineage through his daughter Fatima. Abraham Eraly thinks his forebears were likely that Khizr Khan&#x27;s ancestors were likely descendants of an Arab family who had long ago settled in the region of Multan during the early Tughluq period, but he doubts his Sayyid lineage. A.L. Srivastava shares a similar viewpoint. According to Richard M. Eaton and Simon Digby, Khizr Khan was a Punjabi chieftain from Khokhar clan. The Timurid invasion and plunder had left the Delhi Sultanate in shambles, and little is known about the rule by the Sayyid dynasty. Annemarie Schimmel notes the first ruler of the dynasty as Khizr Khan, who assumed power as a vassal of the Timurid Empire. His successor was Mubarak Khan, who renamed himself Mubarak Shah, discontinued his father&#x27;s nominal allegiance to Timur and unsuccessfully tried to regain lost territories in Punjab from Khokhar warlords.
With the power of the Sayyid dynasty faltering, Islam&#x27;s history on the Indian subcontinent underwent a profound change, according to Schimmel. The previously dominant Sunni sect of Islam became diluted, alternate Muslim sects such as Shia rose, and new competing centres of Islamic culture took roots beyond Delhi.

In the course of the late Sayyid dynasty, the Delhi Sultanate shrank until it became a minor power. By the time of the last Sayyid ruler, Alam Shah (whose name translated to &quot;king of the world&quot;), this resulted in a common northern Indian witticism, according to which the &quot;kingdom of the king of the world extends from Delhi to Palam&quot;, i.e. merely . Historian Richard M. Eaton noted that this saying showcased how the &quot;once-mighty empire had become a joke&quot;. The Sayyid dynasty was displaced by the Lodi dynasty in 1451, however, resulting in a resurgence of the Delhi Sultanate.

====Lodi dynasty (1451–1526)====
The Lodi dynasty was an Afghan, or Turco-Afghan dynasty, related to the Pashtun (Afghan) Lodi tribe. The founder of the dynasty, Bahlul Khan Lodi, was a Khalji of the Lodi clan. He started his reign by attacking the Muslim Jaunpur Sultanate to expand the influence of the Delhi Sultanate and was partially successful through a treaty. Thereafter, the region from Delhi to Varanasi (then at the border of Bengal province), was back under the influence of the Delhi Sultanate.
After Bahlul Lodi died, his son Nizam Khan assumed power, renamed himself Sikandar Lodi and ruled from 1489 to 1517. One of the better-known rulers of the dynasty, Sikandar Lodi expelled his brother Barbak Shah from Jaunpur, installed his son Jalal Khan as the ruler, then proceeded east to make claims on Bihar. The Muslim governors of Bihar agreed to pay tribute and taxes but operated independently of the Delhi Sultanate. Sikandar Lodi led a campaign of destruction of temples, particularly around Mathura. He also moved his capital and court from Delhi to Agra, an ancient Hindu city that had been destroyed during the plunder and attacks of the early Delhi Sultanate period. Sikandar thus erected buildings with Indo-Islamic architecture in Agra during his rule, and the growth of Agra continued during the Mughal Empire, after the end of the Delhi Sultanate.

Sikandar Lodi died a natural death in 1517, and his second son Ibrahim Lodi assumed power. Ibrahim did not enjoy the support of Afghan and Persian nobles or regional chiefs. Ibrahim attacked and killed his elder brother Jalal Khan, who was installed as the governor of Jaunpur by his father and had the support of the amirs and chiefs. Ibrahim Lodi was unable to consolidate his power, and after Jalal Khan&#x27;s death, the governor of Punjab, Daulat Khan Lodi, reached out to the Mughal Babur and invited him to attack the Delhi Sultanate. Babur defeated and killed Ibrahim Lodi in the Battle of Panipat in 1526. The death of Ibrahim Lodi ended the Delhi Sultanate, and the Mughal Empire replaced it.

==Government and politics==
The historian Peter Jackson explains in &quot;The New Cambridge History of Islam&quot;: &quot;The elite of the early Delhi sultanate comprised overwhelmingly first-generation immigrants from Iran and Central Asia: Persians, Turks, Ghūrīs, Khalaj from the hot regions (&quot;garmsīr&quot;) of modern Afghanistan&quot;.

===Political system===

Medieval scholars such as Isami and Barani suggested that the prehistory of the Delhi Sultanate lay in the Ghaznavid state and that its ruler, Mahmud Ghaznavi, provided the foundation and inspiration integral in the making of the Delhi regime. The Mongol and Hindu monarchies were the great &quot;Others&quot; in these narratives and the Persianate and class-conscious, aristocratic virtues of the ideal state were creatively memorialized in the Ghaznavid state, now the templates for the Delhi Sultanate. Cast within a historical narrative it allowed for a more self-reflective, linear rooting of the Sultanate in the great traditions of Muslim statecraft. Over time, successive Muslim dynasties created a &quot;centralized structure in the Persian tradition whose task was to mobilize human and material resources for the ongoing armed struggle against both Mongol and Hindu monarchies&quot;. The monarch was not the Sultan of the Hindus or of, say, the people of Haryana, rather in the eyes of the Sultanate&#x27;s chroniclers, the Muslims constituted what in more recent times would be termed a &quot;Staatsvolk&quot;. For many Muslim observers, the ultimate justification for any ruler within the Islamic world was the protection and advancement of the faith. For the Sultans, as for their Ghaznavid and Ghurid predecessors, this entailed the suppression of heterodox Muslims, and Firuz Shah attached some importance to the fact that he had acted against the ashab-i had-u ibadat (deviators and latitudinarians). It also involved plundering and extorting tribute from, independent Hindu principalities. Firuz Shah, who believed that India was changed into a Muslim nation, declared that &quot;no zimmi living in a Musalman country might dare to act&quot;.

The Hindu kingdoms who submitted to Islamic rule qualified as &quot;protected peoples&quot; according to the wide spectrum of the educated Muslim community within the subcontinent. The balance of the evidence is that in the latter half of the fourteenth century, if not before, the jizyah was levied as a discriminatory tax on non-Muslims, although even then it is difficult to see how such a measure could have been enforced outside the principal centres of Muslim authority. The Delhi Sultanate also continued the governmental conventions of the previous Hindu polities, claiming paramountcy of some of its subjects rather than exclusive supreme control. Accordingly, it did not interfere with the autonomy and military of certain conquered Hindu rulers and freely included Hindu vassals and officials.

===Economic policy and administration===
The economic policy of the Delhi Sultanate was characterized by greater government involvement in the economy relative to the Classical Hindu dynasties, and increased penalties for private businesses that broke government regulations. Alauddin Khalji replaced the private markets with four centralized government-run markets, appointed a &quot;market controller&quot;, and implemented strict price controls on all kinds of goods, &quot;from caps to socks; from combs to pins; from vegetables to soups, from sweetmeats to chapatis&quot; (according to Ziauddin Barani [c. 1357]). The price controls were inflexible even during droughts. Capitalist investors were completely banned from participating in the horse trade, animal and slave brokers were forbidden from collecting commissions, and private merchants were eliminated from all animal and slave markets. Bans were instituted against hoarding and regrating, granaries were nationalized and limits were placed on the amount of grain that could be used by cultivators for personal use.

Various licensing rules were imposed. Registration of merchants was required, and expensive goods such as certain fabrics were deemed &quot;unnecessary&quot; for the general public and required a permit from the state to be purchased. These licenses were issued to &quot;amirs&quot;, &quot;maliks&quot;, and other important persons in government. Agricultural taxes were raised to 50%.

Traders regarded the regulations as burdensome, and violations were severely punished, leading to further resentment among the traders. A network of spies was instituted to ensure the implementation of the system; even after price controls were lifted after Khalji&#x27;s death, Barani claims that the fear of his spies remained and that people continued to avoid trading in expensive commodities.

===Social policies===

The sultanate enforced Islamic religious prohibitions on anthropomorphic representations in art.

===Military===
The army of the Delhi sultans initially consisted of nomadic Turkic Mamluk military slaves belonging to Muhammad of Ghor.

The nucleus of this Southeast Asian sultanate military were the Turco-Afghani regular units named &quot;Wajih&quot;, which were composed of elite household cavalry archers who came from slave backgrounds. A major military contribution of the Delhi Sultanate was their successful campaigns repelling the Mongol Empire&#x27;s invasions of India, which could have been devastating for the Indian subcontinent, like the Mongol invasions of China, Persia and Europe. Were it not for the Delhi Sultanate, the Mongol Empire may have been successful in invading India.

The strength of the armies changes according to time. Historians state the Delhi sultanate during the Khalji dynasty maintained 300,000–400,000 horse cavalry and 2500–3000 war elephant as a standing army. Its successor state, the Tughlaq dynasty further expanded into 500,000 horse cavalry in their force.

== Economy ==
Some historians argue that the Delhi Sultanate was responsible for making India more multicultural and cosmopolitan. The establishment of the Delhi Sultanate in India has been compared to the expansion of the Mongol Empire and called &quot;part of a larger trend occurring throughout much of Eurasia, in which nomadic people migrated from the steppes of Inner Asia and became politically dominant&quot;.

According to Angus Maddison, between the years 1000 and 1500, India&#x27;s GDP, of which the sultanates represented a significant part, grew nearly 8% to $60.5 billion in 1500. Though the overall the percentage of the GDP share reduced from 33% to 22% According to Maddison&#x27;s estimates, India&#x27;s population grew from 85 million in 1200 to 101 million in 1500 AD in the period.
The Delhi Sultanate period coincided with more use of mechanical technology in the Indian subcontinent. India previously already had highly sophisticated agriculture, food crops, textiles, medicine, minerals, and metals. Water wheels also previously existed in India, as described by various Chinese monks and Arab travellers and writers in their books. During the Delhi Sultanate, various mechanical devices were introduced from the Islamic world to India, such as geared water-raising wheels and other machines with gears, pulleys, cams, and cranks. Later, Mughal emperor Babur provided a description on the use of water wheels in the Delhi Sultanate.

According to historians Arnold Pacey and Irfan Habib, the spinning wheel was introduced to India from Iran during the Delhi Sultanate. Smith and Cothren suggested that it was invented in India during the latter half of the first millennium, but Pacey and Habib said these early references to cotton spinning do not identify a wheel, but more likely refer to hand spinning. The earliest unambiguous reference to a spinning wheel in India is dated to 1350. The worm gear roller cotton gin was invented in the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries; Habib states that the development may likely occurred in peninsular India, before becoming more widespread across India during the Mughal era. The incorporation of the crank handle in the cotton gin may have appeared sometime during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire.

India and China have connections throughout the thousands of years of history. Paper had already reached some parts of India as early as the 6th or 7th century, initially through Chinese travellers and the ancient silk road which India was very well connected with. Earlier some historians believed that paper failed to catch on as palmyra leaves and birch bark remained far more popular but this theory was discredited later on. On the other hand, the paper may have arrived in Bengal from a separate route, as 15th-century Chinese traveller Ma Huan remarked that Bengali paper was white and made from &quot;bark of a tree&quot; similar to the Chinese method of papermaking (as opposed to the Middle-Eastern method of using rags and waste material), suggesting a direct route from China for the arrival of paper in Bengal and paper was already very well established and widespread in that part of the subcontinent.

==Factors==

===Demographics===
According to one set of very uncertain estimates by modern historians, the total Indian population had largely been stagnant at 75 million during the Middle Kingdoms era from 1 AD to 1000 AD. During the Medieval Delhi Sultanate era from 1000 to 1500, India as a whole experienced lasting population growth for the first time in a thousand years, with its population increasing nearly 50% to 110 million by 1500 AD.

===Culture===
While the Indian subcontinent has had invaders from Central Asia since ancient times, what made the Muslim invasions different is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system, the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics, even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent, though the non-Muslim population was left to their laws and customs. They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes. This led to the rise of a new Indian culture that was mixed in nature, different from ancient Indian culture. The overwhelming majority of Muslims in India were Indian natives converted to Islam. This factor also played an important role in the synthesis of cultures.

The Hindustani language (Hindi) began to emerge in the Delhi Sultanate period, developed from the Middle Indo-Aryan &quot;apabhramsha&quot; vernaculars of North India. Amir Khusrau, who lived in the 13th century CE during the Delhi Sultanate period in North India, used a form of Hindustani, which was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the period, in his writings and referred to it as &quot;Hindavi&quot;.

The officers, the Sultans, Khans, Maliks and the soldiers wore the Islamic qabas dress in the style of Khwarezm, which were tucked in the middle of the body, while the turban and kullah were common headwear. The turbans were wrapped around the kullah (caps), and the feet were covered with red boots. The Wazirs and Katibs also dressed like the soldiers, except they did not use belts, and often let down a piece of cloth in front of them in the manner of the Sufis. The judges and the learned men wore ample gowns (farajiyat) and an Arabic garment (durra).

=== Architecture ===


The start of the Delhi Sultanate in 1206 under Qutb al-Din Aibak introduced a large Islamic state to India, using Central Asian styles. The types and forms of large buildings required by Muslim elites, with mosques and tombs much the most common, were very different from those previously built in India. The exteriors of both were very often topped by large domes and made extensive use of arches. Both of these features were hardly used in Hindu temple architecture and other indigenous Indian styles. Both types of building essentially consist of a single large space under a high dome, and completely avoid the figurative sculpture so important to Hindu temple architecture.

The important Qutb Minar complex in Delhi was begun under Muhammad of Ghor, by 1199, and continued under Qutb al-Din Aibak and later sultans. The Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, now a ruin, was the first structure. Like other early Islamic buildings, it re-used elements such as columns from destroyed Hindu and Jain temples, including one on the same site whose platform was reused. The style was Iranian, but the arches were still corbelled in the traditional Indian way.

Beside it is the extremely tall Qutb Minar, a minaret or victory tower, whose original four stages reach 73 meters (with a final stage added later). Its closest comparator is the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of , a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns; in Delhi the shaft is fluted with &quot;superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies&quot; at the top of each stage. In general minarets were slow to be used in India, and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.

The Tomb of Iltutmish was added by 1236; its dome, the squinches again corbelled, and is now missing, and the intricate carving has been described as having an &quot;angular harshness&quot;, from carvers working in an unfamiliar tradition. Other elements were added to the complex over the next two centuries.

Another very early mosque, begun in the 1190s, is the Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra in Ajmer, Rajasthan, built for the same Delhi rulers, again with corbelled arches and domes. Here Hindu temple columns (and possibly some new ones) are piled up in threes to achieve extra height. Both mosques had large detached screens with pointed corbelled arches added in front of them, probably under Iltutmish a couple of decades later. In these, the central arch is taller, in imitation of an iwan. At Ajmer, the smaller screen arches are tentatively cusped, for the first time in India.

By around 1300 true domes and arches with voussoirs were being built; the ruined Tomb of Balban (d. 1287) in Delhi may be the earliest survival. The Alai Darwaza gatehouse at the Qutb complex, from 1311, still shows a cautious approach to the new technology, with very thick walls and a shallow dome, only visible from a certain distance or height. Bold contrasting colours of masonry, with red sandstone and white marble, introduce what was to become a common feature of Indo-Islamic architecture, substituting for the polychrome tiles used in Persia and Central Asia. The pointed arches come together slightly at their base, giving a mild horseshoe arch effect, and their internal edges are not cusped but lined with conventionalized &quot;spearhead&quot; projections, possibly representing lotus buds. Jali, stone openwork screens, are introduced here; they already had been long used in temples.

====Tughlaq architecture====

The tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam (built 1320 to 1324) in Multan, Pakistan is a large octagonal brick-built mausoleum with polychrome glazed decoration that remains much closer to the styles of Iran and Afghanistan. Timber is also used internally. This was the earliest major monument of the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1413), built during the unsustainable expansion of its massive territory. It was built for a Sufi saint rather than a sultan, and most of the many Tughlaq tombs are much less exuberant. The tomb of the founder of the dynasty, Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq (d. 1325) is more austere, but impressive; like a Hindu temple, it is topped with a small amalaka and a round finial like a kalasha. Unlike the buildings mentioned previously, it completely lacks carved texts and sits in a compound with high walls and battlements. Both these tombs have external walls sloping slightly inwards, by 25° in the Delhi tomb, like many fortifications including the ruined Tughlaqabad Fort opposite the tomb, intended as the new capital.

The Tughlaqs had a corps of government architects and builders, and in this and other roles employed many Hindus. They left many buildings and a standardized dynastic style. The third sultan, Firuz Shah (r. 1351–88) is said to have designed buildings himself and was the longest ruler and greatest builder of the dynasty. His Firoz Shah Palace Complex (started 1354) at Hisar, Haryana is a ruin, but parts are in fair condition. Some buildings from his reign take forms that had been rare or unknown in Islamic buildings. He was buried in the large Hauz Khas Complex in Delhi, with many other buildings from his period and the later Sultanate, including several small domed pavilions supported only by columns.

By this time Islamic architecture in India had adopted some features of earlier Indian architecture, such as the use of a high plinth, and often mouldings around its edges, as well as columns and brackets and hypostyle halls. After the death of Firoz the Tughlaqs declined, and the following Delhi dynasties were weak. Most of the monumental buildings constructed were tombs, although the impressive Lodi Gardens in Delhi (adorned with fountains, &quot;charbagh&quot; gardens, ponds, tombs and mosques) were constructed by the late Lodi dynasty. The architecture of other regional Muslim states was often more impressive.

===Cities===
While the sacking of cities was not uncommon in medieval warfare, the army of the Delhi Sultanate also often destroyed cities in their military expeditions. According to Jain chronicler Jinaprabha Suri, Nusrat Khan&#x27;s conquests destroyed hundreds of towns including Ashapalli (modern-day Ahmedabad), Anhilvad (modern-day Patan), Vanthali and Surat in Gujarat. This account is corroborated by Ziauddin Barani.

===Battles and massacres===
* Ghiyas ud din Balban wiped out the Rajputs of Mewar and Awadh, killing approximately 100,000 people. 
* Alauddin Khalji ordered the killing of 30,000 people at Chittor.
* Alauddin Khalji ordered the killing Brahmins during his raid on Devagiri.
* According to a hymn, Muhammad bin Tughlaq is said to have killed 12,000 Hindu ascetics during the sacking of Srirangam.
* Firuz Shah Tughlaq killed 180,000 people during his invasion of Odisha.

===Desecration===

Historian Richard Eaton has tabulated a campaign of destruction of idols and temples by Delhi Sultans, intermixed with certain years where the temples were protected from desecration. In his paper, he has listed 37 instances of Hindu temples being desecrated or destroyed in India during the Delhi Sultanate, from 1234 to 1518, for which reasonable evidences are available. He notes that this was not unusual in medieval India, as there were numerous recorded instances of temple desecration by Hindu and Buddhist kings against rival Indian kingdoms between 642 and 1520, involving conflict between devotees of different Hindu deities, as well as between Hindus, Buddhists and Jains at small scales. He also noted there were also many instances of Delhi sultans, who often had Hindu ministers, ordering the protection, maintenance and repairing of temples, according to both Muslim and Hindu sources. For example, a Sanskrit inscription notes that Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq repaired a Shiva and Parvati temple in Bidar after his Deccan conquest. There was often a pattern of Delhi sultans plundering or damaging temples during the conquest and then patronizing or repairing temples after the conquest. This pattern came to an end with the Mughal Empire, where Akbar&#x27;s chief minister Abu&#x27;l-Fazl criticized the excesses of earlier sultans such as Mahmud of Ghazni.

In the majority of cases, the demolished remains, rocks and broken statue pieces of temples destroyed by Delhi sultans were reused to build mosques and other buildings. For example, the Qutb complex in Delhi was built from stones from 27 demolished Hindu and Jain temples by some accounts. Similarly, the Muslim mosque in Khanapur, Maharashtra was built from the looted parts and demolished remains of Hindu temples. Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji destroyed Buddhist Religious Centres such as Odantapuri &amp; Vikramshila in 1193 at the beginning of the Delhi Sultanate.

The first historical record of a campaign of destruction of temples and defacement of faces or heads of Hindu idols lasted from 1193 to 1194 in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh under the command of Ghuri. Under the Mamluks and Khaljis, the campaign of temple desecration expanded to Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra, and continued through the late 13th century. The campaign extended to Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu under Malik Kafur and Ulugh Khan in the 14th century, and by the Bahmanis in the 15th century. Orissa temples were destroyed in the 14th century under the Tughlaqs.

Beyond destruction and desecration, the sultans of the Delhi Sultanate in some cases had forbidden the reconstruction or repair of damaged Hindu, Jain and Buddhist temples. In certain cases, the Sultanate would grant a permit for repairs and construction of temples if the patron or religious community paid jizya (fee, tax). For example, a proposal by the Chinese to repair Himalayan Buddhist temples destroyed by the Sultanate army was refused, because such temple repairs were only allowed if the Chinese agreed to pay jizya tax to the treasury of the Sultanate. According to Eva De Clercq, an expert in the study of Jainism, the Delhi Sultans did not strictly prohibit construction of new temples in the sultanate, Islamic law notwithstanding. In his memoirs, Firoz Shah Tughlaq describes how he destroyed temples and built mosques instead and killed those who dared build new temples. Other historical records from &quot;wazirs&quot;, &quot;amirs&quot; and the court historians of various Sultans of the Delhi Sultanate describe the grandeur of idols and temples they witnessed in their campaigns and how these were destroyed and desecrated.

<doc id="295416" wikidata="Q316485" url="?curid=295416" title="Ultravox">
<text>Ultravox (earlier styled as Ultravox!) were a British new romantic band, formed in London in April 1974 as Tiger Lily. Between 1980 and 1986, they scored seven Top Ten albums and seventeen Top 40 singles in the UK, the most successful of which was their 1981 hit &quot;Vienna&quot;.

From 1974 until 1979, singer John Foxx was frontman and the main driving force behind Ultravox. Foxx left the band in March 1979 to embark on a solo career. Midge Ure officially took over as lead singer, guitarist and frontman on 1 November 1979 (despite writing and rehearsing with the band from April of that year) after he and keyboardist Billy Currie worked on the studio project Visage. Ure revitalised the band and steered it to commercial chart success lasting until 1987, at which time the group disbanded.

A new line-up, led by Currie, was formed in 1992, but achieved limited success with two albums failing to chart and one solitary single reaching 90 in the UK chart. The band&#x27;s best-known line-up of Currie, Ure, bassist Chris Cross and drummer Warren Cann re-formed in 2008 and performed a series of shows in 2009 and 2010 before releasing a new studio album, &quot;Brill!ant&quot;, in May 2012 which reached 21 in the British Album Charts. In November 2013, Ultravox performed as special guests on a four-date UK arena tour with Simple Minds. These shows proved to be Ultravox&#x27;s last, as in 2017 both Currie and Ure indicated that Ultravox had run its course.

== History ==
=== Early years – Tiger Lily: 1974–1976 ===

The band was formed in April 1974 on the initiative of vocalist and songwriter Dennis Leigh, a then Royal College of Art student, and was originally known as Tiger Lily. An initial but incomplete line-up comprised Leigh plus Chris Allen who was then billed as Chris St. John (bass guitar) and Stevie Shears (guitar), with Warren Cann (drums) and Billy Currie (violin) joining in May and October 1974 respectively. The group released one single in 1975, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;, a cover of the Fats Waller song, which featured in a soft porn film. Later, the band went through a series of name changes including The Zips, Fire of London, London Soundtrack, and The Damned, using this last name for a few weeks before discovering that the Damned had already taken it.

=== Experimental years: 1976–1979 ===
==== &quot;Ultravox!&quot; ====
On the strength of their live act, the band signed to Island Records in 1976. The group had still not finalised their band name, wanting to make a good and lasting choice. In October 1976, while working on the late stages of their debut album, the band conceived the name “Ultravox!” (the exclamation mark was a reference to krautrock band Neu!, produced by Conny Plank, who later produced three Ultravox albums). At the same time, Leigh chose John Foxx and Allen chose Chris Cross as their respective stage names. In February 1977, Island released their eponymous debut album, &quot;Ultravox!&quot;.

Like many other bands that formed Britain&#x27;s punk and new wave movements, Ultravox! drew inspiration from the art-school side of glam rock. Musically, Ultravox! were heavily influenced by Roxy Music, the New York Dolls, David Bowie and Kraftwerk. Their debut was co-produced by Steve Lillywhite and Brian Eno (who next co-wrote and performed with Bowie on &quot;Low&quot;). &quot;Ultravox!&quot;&#x27;s sales were disappointing, and neither the album nor the associated single &quot;Dangerous Rhythm&quot; managed to enter the UK charts. Relations within the band were on an occasionally tenuous footing during this time as Foxx declared that he intended to live without emotions, a sentiment he wrote into the début album track &quot;I Want to Be a Machine&quot;.

Ultravox! returned later in 1977 with the punkier &quot;Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot;. Sales of both the album and its lead single, &quot;ROckWrok&quot;, were poor, both failing to register on the UK charts. &quot;ROckWrok&quot; had a punk-lyric chorus, with the words &quot;Come on, let&#x27;s tangle in the dark/Fuck like a dog, bite like a shark&quot;. (Despite this, it got airplay on BBC Radio 1.) Although &quot;Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot; was dominated by guitars and electric violin, the final track, &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot;, was a prototypical synthpop song. One of the first tracks by a British band to feature a drum machine (a Roland Rhythm 77 (TR-77) with preset patterns) and a tenor saxophone solo played by &quot;c.c.&quot; of the band Gloria Mundi. “Hiroshima Mon Amour” signalled a new direction for Ultravox. The energy, anger and popular appeal of punk was fading in 1978, and the more creative UK punk genre talent sought new directions—calling themselves British new wave instead of punk rock artists. &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot; remains a critics&#x27; and fans&#x27; favourite from the group&#x27;s initial period. Ultravox! also performed it on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; later in 1978.

==== &quot;Systems of Romance&quot; and split with John Foxx ====
In early March 1978, Stevie Shears, whose style of guitar playing was considered a limiting factor, was sacked from the band after they toured England and joined Cowboys International in 1980. He was replaced by Robert Simon (ex-member of Ian North&#x27;s Neo), who during his first days with the band changed his performance-name to Robin Simon. Some time in 1978, the group also dropped the exclamation mark, becoming simply &quot;Ultravox&quot;. The new line-up performed live at the Reading Festival along with Radio Stars, Penetration, Sham 69, the Pirates and the Jam, playing early versions of &quot;Slow Motion&quot; and &quot;Quiet Men&quot; on 27 August 1978.

Their third album, 1978&#x27;s &quot;Systems of Romance&quot;, was recorded with producer Conny Plank (the producer of the first four albums by German electronic outfit Kraftwerk) and engineer Dave Hutchins at Plank&#x27;s Studio in rural Germany. Musically, the album was markedly different from Ultravox&#x27;s earlier work, bringing synthesisers to the forefront of the group&#x27;s sound. Frustrated by too many opinions of how the band should sound, Foxx decided to leave the band and pursue a purer electronic style already at the initial rehearsals for &quot;Systems of Romance&quot;, but had to await the band&#x27;s commitments for that album.

Despite some positive reviews and initial sales of over 25 000 copies, Island dropped the band on 31 December 1978. Ultravox embarked on a self-financed US tour in early 1979 and, to their amazement, received an enthusiastic response by the American audience at several sold out venues. But after their final gig near San Francisco in March 1979, Foxx declared his intention to leave the band and pursue a solo career. He gave the remaining members the band name and returned to London. According to Warren Cann it was a mutual decision between the band and Foxx to part ways after repeated quarrels. Simon remained in the US and briefly joined The Futants, a punk band from New York. He later returned to England and teamed up with Howard Devoto to replace guitarist John McGeoch in the band Magazine. The remaining members made their way back to a Britain in the midst of the Winter of Discontent. Island dropped the three Ultravox albums from its catalogue, and released a compilation of highlights from the group&#x27;s first three albums in 1980, called &quot;Three into One&quot;.

Foxx subsequently signed to Virgin Records and released his album &quot;Metamatic&quot; in January 1980. By this time, Billy Currie had been recruited by the rising star Gary Numan in 1979 to do a performance at &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; show with his band Tubeway Army. Numan had been a fan of Ultravox and Currie was also asked to play on Numan&#x27;s début solo album, &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;, and its subsequent tour. Warren Cann went to work for Zaine Griff, while Chris Cross did some shows with James Honeyman-Scott (of The Pretenders) and Barrie Masters (from Eddie and the Hot Rods).

=== Midge Ure years: 1979–1987 ===

With the band seemingly over, Ultravox were then revitalised by Midge Ure, who joined the band as vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist. He had already achieved minor success with semi-glam outfit Slik and Glen Matlock&#x27;s The Rich Kids, and in 1979, he was temporarily playing with hard rock band Thin Lizzy on their American tour, replacing Gary Moore.

Ure and Billy Currie had met while collaborating on Visage, a studio-based band fronted by New Romantic icon and nightclub impresario Steve Strange. Ure and Currie were part of the Visage ensemble on a part-time basis while simultaneously being in Ultravox. During Ure and Currie&#x27;s tenure, Visage had released two successful albums and had a string of hit singles (the most notable being &quot;Fade to Grey&quot;), but Ure decided to leave in 1982 to concentrate solely on Ultravox. Currie remained with Visage for a while longer, but he too had left them by 1984.

Encouraged by Visage drummer and mutual friend Rusty Egan, Currie asked Ure to join Ultravox. The first material for a prospective new Ultravox record came together quickly and the group decided to tour the US again at the end of 1979. They did so in the hope of being picked up by an American label. Ure knew of Ultravox&#x27;s past, being a fan of &quot;Systems&quot; to the point where the new four-piece outfit (Ultravox mk. III) played songs from that album with Ure singing Foxx&#x27;s lyrics.

Most of the album that would become &quot;Vienna&quot; was ready to record by the time Ultravox signed a new record deal with Chrysalis Records. &quot;Vienna&quot;, heralded a major change of direction and would become their most successful to date, far surpassing any of the previous Ultravox (or Foxx) albums. As with &quot;Systems of Romance&quot;, it was produced by Conny Plank.

Released in July 1980, the &quot;Vienna&quot; album produced the band&#x27;s first UK Top 40 hit with &quot;Sleepwalk&quot; reaching No. 29, while the album itself initially peaked at No. 14. A second single, &quot;Passing Strangers&quot;, failed to reach the Top 40, only reaching No. 57, but the band achieved a substantial hit with the third single, the album&#x27;s title track. Accompanied by a highly distinctive video (inspired by Carol Reed&#x27;s 1949 film &quot;The Third Man&quot;), the single became Ultravox&#x27;s biggest ever hit, released in January 1981 and peaking at Number 2 (kept off the top spot by John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Woman&quot; and then Joe Dolce&#x27;s &quot;Shaddap You Face&quot;). On the strength of the single, the album then re-entered the chart and reached No. 3 in early 1981. A fourth single from the album, &quot;All Stood Still&quot;, peaked at No. 8. in 1981, and &quot;Slow Motion&quot; from &quot;Systems of Romance&quot; was also re-issued, reaching No. 33 the same year.

This was soon followed by &quot;Rage in Eden&quot; (1981), with the band returning to Plank&#x27;s studio in Cologne for what turned out to be a difficult recording session. Whereas the &quot;Vienna&quot; material had been performed live a great deal prior to a three-week recording process, &quot;Rage in Eden&quot; took over three months. The album featured a long track in three parts on the second side. The album peaked at No. 4 in the UK, while two singles from the album, &quot;The Thin Wall&quot; and &quot;The Voice&quot;, both made the UK Top 20, reaching No. 14 and No. 16 respectively.

Ultravox teamed up with producer George Martin for 1982&#x27;s &quot;Quartet&quot;, which peaked at No. 6 in the UK and contained four Top 20 hit singles; &quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot; reaching No. 12 and &quot;Hymn&quot; No. 11 both in 1982, and &quot;Visions in Blue&quot; and in 1983 &quot;We Came to Dance&quot; charting at No. 15 and No. 18 respectively. It was their most successful album in the US, peaking at No. 61.

The band undertook a major world tour, the Monument Tour, which was recorded and released as a live LP and video in 1983, which also reached the UK top ten.

Ultravox then decided to produce their next album themselves. 1984&#x27;s &quot;Lament&quot; continued the band&#x27;s run of top ten albums and produced three top 40 hit singles, including the international hit &quot;Dancing with Tears in My Eyes&quot; (UK No. 3), &quot;Lament&quot; (No. 22) and &quot;One Small Day&quot; peaking at No. 27.

After the &quot;Set Movements Tour&quot; in 1984, a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation spanning the band&#x27;s 1980s output was released entitled &quot;The Collection&quot;. It was preceded by a new single, &quot;Love&#x27;s Great Adventure&quot;, which enjoyed massive radio airplay that autumn and eventually peaked at No. 12 in the UK, accompanied by a popular Indiana Jones-style spoof video. &quot;The Collection&quot; went triple Platinum and reached No. 2 in the UK album chart, the band&#x27;s highest ever peak.

In November 1984, Ure also co-wrote and produced the Band Aid single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;. The four Ultravox-members took a long break from each other, but appeared at Live Aid the following year and played four of their hit singles (&quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot;, &quot;Dancing with Tears in My Eyes&quot;, &quot;One Small Day&quot; and &quot;Vienna&quot;). Last time they were touring in 1984 they had twenty-two keyboards on stage, and the sound checks alone took five hours, so Ultravox actually chose the songs that they could perform with the least equipment, with no rehearsal and no sound check. With Ultravox being switched in the running order so that Princess Diana could see the Boomtown Rats before leaving Wembley, the start of the Ultravox set was lost to a poor hand-over from an over-running foreign link up. As the concert was never officially archived, this could not be restored to the partial record of the event available on the official DVD. Later in 1985, Ure scored a No. 1 solo hit with &quot;If I Was&quot; and his solo album &quot;The Gift&quot; reached No. 2 in the UK.

During the time Midge was away working with his solo album and tour, Cann, Currie and Cross recorded demos to a forthcoming album. They recorded the track &quot;Ukraine&quot; which is available on Currie&#x27;s 1991 solo album &quot;Stand up and Walk&quot;.

Ure later said that when he came back they were all working in different directions. In a band meeting before the new recording began in 1986, Warren Cann was dismissed from the band due to musical differences. Ure said 1986: &quot;After the two year break the differences that might have been very small two years ago, had magnified during that time, we had grown apart. It seemed like we could not work with him.&quot;

Ultravox recorded the &quot;U-Vox&quot; album with Big Country&#x27;s Mark Brzezicki on drums in Plank&#x27;s studio in Germany. The &quot;U-Vox&quot; album, released in October 1986, was later described by Ure as &quot;unfocused&quot;. Although it continued their string of top ten albums in the UK, its singles showed declining chart results: &quot;Same Old Story&quot; peaking at No. 31, and &quot;All Fall Down&quot; at No. 30 in 1986, with &quot;All in One Day&quot; reaching only No. 88 in 1987. In 1987, Ultravox decided not to continue after the &quot;U-Vox&quot; tour and split up.

Currie signed a deal with IRS Records and recorded a solo album. Cross retired from the music business to become a psychotherapist. Cann later moved to Los Angeles to work in the movie business. Currie and Robin Simon reunited in 1989 as the short-lived Humania, performing live shows, but never making a release until 2006, the album &quot;Sinews of the Soul&quot;.

=== Currie&#x27;s own Ultravox in the Nineties: 1992–1996 ===
Without any other original members, Currie reformed Ultravox again in 1992 with vocalist Tony Fenelle to record &quot;Revelation&quot;, and later Sam Blue replaced Fenelle in a new five-piece Ultravox line-up, lending his voice to another release, &quot;Ingenuity&quot; released November 1994. This line-up also released the live album &quot;Future Picture&quot; recorded in Italy 1993.

These albums had little commercial success and the band dissolved again in 1996. Currie said 2006 about the attempt to continue Ultravox: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a good idea but, in retrospect, it&#x27;s always easy to say that.&quot;

=== Reunion: 2008–2013 ===
In September 2008, both &quot;Vienna&quot; and &quot;Rage in Eden&quot; were released in digitally remastered two-disc format with the second disc containing previously unreleased material.

On 2 October 2008 Midge Ure and Billy Currie met again and played an acoustic &quot;Vienna&quot; together, on Geoff Lloyd Show on Absolute Radio in Abbey Road Studios. After this they got an offer from Live Nation, who their former manager Chris O’Donnell was now working for.

On 6 November 2008 the official announcement came: Warren Cann, Chris Cross, Billy Currie and Midge Ure reformed Ultravox again, for a 15-date UK tour in April 2009, entitled &quot;Return to Eden&quot;. This would be the first time the classic line-up of the band had performed together since Live Aid in 1985. The first show was played at Edinburgh Playhouse 10 April 2009.

On Jonathan Ross&#x27;s show on BBC&#x27;s Radio 2 on 21 February 2009, Ure discussed the tour, with all four members of the most successful incarnation of the band on board. He mentioned that this reunion was not planned in light of the previously mentioned events, but rather was spontaneous and happened very quickly with the band members talking and communicating online (using email and Skype). The interview did not reveal whether or not new material would be recorded as a result of the reunion tour. Speaking to the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;, Ure stated that the reunion was only a one-off, and there would be no new material from the group. He said: &quot;We&#x27;re not trying to recapture our youth and won&#x27;t be writing new songs or recording another album. This is about celebrating our music and our anniversary.&quot;

&quot;Quartet&quot; and &quot;Monument&quot; were released in February 2009, also in two-disc editions. The second disc in the &quot;Monument&quot; package is a DVD containing the concert video that was previously only available on VHS tape. The other Chrysalis-era releases were planned for similar future releases.

Since success from touring the UK they have extended the tour to Germany and Belgium. A live CD and DVD of Ultravox&#x27;s sell-out Roundhouse show was released on 5 April 2010. The DVD features a documentary filmed on the build-up to and during the reunion tour, parts of it filmed by Midge Ure.

Ultravox returned to performing live with their Return to Eden II tour in Europe during 2010. In August they played four shows in Sweden together with Howard Jones and Alphaville. It was on this tour the band members decided that they should record some new material again.

On 20 January 2011, via their official website, Ultravox.org.uk, the band announced that a new studio album was nearing completion. In 2011 Ultravox released a fan store exclusive EP called &quot;Moments from Eden&quot;, featured four new live tracks recorded 23 April 2010 at Grosse Freiheit, Hamburg, and 24 April 2010 at Admiralspalast, Berlin.

Ultravox&#x27;s 11th studio album, &quot;Brill!ant&quot;, was released on 28 May 2012. Following this release the band embarked on the &#x27;Brilliant Tour&#x27; performing shows across the UK and Europe in late 2012.

On 30 November 2013, Ultravox performed their last show at The O2 Arena in London, as special guests on a four date UK arena tour with Simple Minds.

On 4 January 2017, Billy Currie announced on his official website that he had decided that his time as a member of Ultravox had come to an end after 43 years. In December 2017, Midge Ure said in an interview with the &quot;Daily Express&quot; that a further reformation by the band was unlikely.

Bassist Chris Cross died on 25 March 2024; His death was confirmed by Midge Ure on 1 April.

=== Legacy ===
Gary Numan has stated that the original 1970s-era Ultravox was the most important influence on his music. Ultravox was also a major influence on early Simple Minds and Duran Duran.

Along with acts like Visage and Gary Numan, Ultravox was one of the early influences on techno. In his book &quot;Energy Flash&quot;, Simon Reynolds quotes Adam Lee Miller of Adult: &quot;I always get a kick when people say the first &#x27;techno&#x27; record was Cybotron&#x27;s &#x27;Alleys of Your Mind&#x27;... To me, it was just a new wave record. It sounds particularly close to &#x27;Mr X&#x27; by Ultravox.&quot;

<doc id="295424" wikidata="Q2451851" url="?curid=295424" title="Salammoniac">
<text>Salammoniac, also sal ammoniac or salmiac, is a rare naturally occurring mineral composed of ammonium chloride, NH4Cl. It forms colorless, white, or yellow-brown crystals in the isometric-hexoctahedral class. It has very poor cleavage and is brittle to conchoidal fracture. It is quite soft, with a Mohs hardness of 1.5 to 2, and it has a low specific gravity of 1.5. It is water-soluble. Salammoniac is also the archaic name for the chemical compound ammonium chloride.

== History ==
Pliny, in Book XXXI of his &quot;Natural History&quot;, refers to a salt produced in the Roman province of Cyrenaica named &quot;hammoniacum&quot;, so called because of its proximity to the nearby Temple of Jupiter Amun (Greek Ἄμμων &quot;Ammon&quot;). However, the description Pliny gives of the salt does not conform to the properties of ammonium chloride. According to Herbert Hoover&#x27;s commentary in his English translation of Georgius Agricola&#x27;s &quot;De re metallica&quot;, it is likely to have been common sea salt. Nevertheless, that salt ultimately gave ammonia and ammonium compounds their name.

The first attested reference to &quot;sal ammoniac&quot; as ammonium chloride is in the Pseudo-Geber work &quot;De inventione veritatis&quot;, where a preparation of sal ammoniac is given in the chapter &quot;De Salis armoniaci præparatione&quot;, &quot;salis armoniaci&quot; being a common name in the Middle Ages for sal ammoniac.

It typically forms as encrustations formed by sublimation around volcanic vents and is found around volcanic fumaroles, guano deposits and burning coal seams. Associated minerals include sodium alum, native sulfur and other fumarole minerals. Notable occurrences include Tajikistan; Mount Vesuvius, Italy; and Parícutin, Michoacan, Mexico.

==Uses==

It is commonly used to clean the soldering iron in the soldering of stained-glass windows.

=== Metal refining ===
In jewellery-making and the refining of precious metals, potassium carbonate is added to gold and silver in a borax-coated crucible to purify iron or steel filings that may have contaminated the scrap. It is then air-cooled and remelted with a one-to-one mixture of powdered charcoal and salammoniac to yield a sturdy ingot of the respective metal or alloy in the case of sterling silver (7.5% copper) or karated gold.

=== Food ===
Salammoniac has also been used in the past in bakery products to give cookies or biscuits their crisp texture, but the application of food grade baking ammonia (ammonium carbonate or (NH4)2CO3) is generally being substituted with the creation of modern baking powder or baking soda (sodium bicarbonate).

Salammoniac is used in salmiac liquorice, for instance salty liquorice or salmiak pastilles.

=== Dyeing ===
In addition, the mineral or, better, its synthetic counterpart, also serves for the production of cooling baths as well as in dyeing and leather tanning.

=== Electronics ===
Salammoniac (as ammonium chloride) was the electrolyte in Leclanché cells, a forerunner of the dry battery; a carbon rod and a zinc rod or cylinder formed the electrodes.

=== Medicine ===
It was also brought into pharmacopeias by Islamic physicians for medicinal purposes.

In the 14th-century &quot;The Canon&#x27;s Yeoman&#x27;s Tale&quot; one of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, an alchemist purports to use &quot;sal armonyak&quot; as smelling salts.

A medical manuscript compiled in 1666 included a recipe for &quot;making Sal Ammoniac according to Robert Boyle&quot; (the noted scientist). It says when inhaled, salammoniac can help &quot;giddyness of the head &amp; in violent Headaches, &amp; in epileptick fits&quot; as well as easing &quot;obstinate griefe &amp; Melancholy.&quot;. The use of &quot;smelling salts&quot; for reviving faint-hearted females became common during Victorian times. Selling salts contain mostly Ammonium Carbonate rather than Ammonium Chloriode. Nevetheless, smelling salts are also often known as &quot;sal ammoniac&quot;. Many athletes use it for reviving them during sports activities.

<doc id="295430" wikidata="Q3032684" url="?curid=295430" title="Dizzy Dean">
<text>Jay Hanna &quot;Dizzy&quot; Dean (January 16, 1910 – July 17, 1974), also known as Jerome Herman Dean (both the 1910 and the 1920 Censuses show his name as &quot;Jay&quot;), was an American professional baseball pitcher. During his Major League Baseball (MLB) career, he played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, and St. Louis Browns.

A brash and colorful personality, Dean is the last National League (NL) pitcher to win 30 games in one season (). After his playing career, Dean became a popular television sports commentator. Dean was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953. When the Cardinals reopened the team Hall of Fame in 2014, he was inducted in the inaugural class.

==Early life==
Dean was born on January 16, 1910, in Lucas, Arkansas, and attended public school only through second grade. He earned his nickname in 1929 in San Antonio, Texas, while in the U.S. Army and pitching for the Fort Sam Houston baseball team. The 19-year-old Dean was on the mound as it took on the MLB&#x27;s Chicago White Sox. As Dean worked his way through the Sox lineup, an exasperated Chicago manager reportedly yelled &quot;Knock that dizzy kid out the box!&quot; He proceeded to call him &quot;dizzy kid&quot; through the rest of the game, and the moniker stuck.

==Professional career==
===St. Louis Cardinals (1930, 1932–1937)===
Dean made his professional debut in 1930 and worked his way up to the major leagues that same year, throwing a complete game three-hitter for the Cardinals.

====Ace of the Gashouse Gang====
Dean made his major league debut on September 28, 1930, the final day of the 1930 regular season. The 20 year-old earned a complete game win against the Pittsburgh Pirates, allowing only three hits and one run. He did not pitch in the major leagues the following year. Dean pitched his first full season in 1932 and turned in a stellar rookie campaign, leading the major leagues with 191 strikeouts and four shutouts. He improved again the following year, when he pitched a 3.04 ERA and again led the league with 199 strikeouts. Perhaps his finest game of the 1933 season came on July 30, when he set a modern-era record by striking out 17 batters in the first game of a doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs.

Dean was best known for winning 30 games in while leading the &quot;Gashouse Gang&quot; Cardinals to the National League pennant and the World Series win over the Detroit Tigers. He had a 30–7 record with a 2.66 ERA during the regular season. His brother, Paul, was also on the team, with a record of 19–11, and was nicknamed &quot;Daffy&quot;, although this was usually only done for press consumption. Though &quot;Diz&quot; sometimes called his brother &quot;Daf&quot;, he typically referred to himself and his brother as &quot;Me an&#x27; Paul.&quot; Continuing the theme, the team included Dazzy Vance and Joe &quot;Ducky&quot; Medwick.

St. Louis was the southernmost and westernmost city in the major leagues at the time, and the Gashouse Gang became a de facto &quot;America&#x27;s Team.&quot; Team members, particularly Southerners such as the Dean brothers and Pepper Martin, became folk heroes in the Depression-ravaged United States. Americans saw in these players a spirit of hard work and perseverance, as opposed to the haughty, highly paid New York Giants, whom the Cardinals chased for the National League pennant.

Much like later sports legends Joe Namath and Muhammad Ali, Dean liked to brag about his prowess and make public predictions. In 1934, Dean predicted, &quot;Me an&#x27; Paul are gonna win 45 games.&quot; On September 21, Dean pitched no-hit ball for eight innings against the Brooklyn Dodgers, finishing with a three-hit shutout in the first game of a doubleheader, his 27th win of the season. Paul then threw a no-hitter in the nightcap to win his 18th, matching the 45 that Dean had predicted. &quot;Gee, Paul,&quot; Dean was heard to say in the locker room afterward, &quot;if I&#x27;d a-known you was gonna throw a no-hitter, I&#x27;d a-throw&#x27;ed one too!&quot; On May 5, 1937, he bet he could strike out Vince DiMaggio four times in the game. He struck him out his first three at-bats, but when DiMaggio hit a popup behind the plate at his fourth, Dean screamed at his catcher, Bruce Ogrodowski, &quot;Drop it!, Drop it!&quot; Ogrodowski did and Dean fanned DiMaggio, winning the bet. Few in the press now doubted Dean&#x27;s boast, as he was also fond of saying, &quot;If ya done it, it ain&#x27;t braggin&#x27;.&quot; Dean finished with 30 wins, the only NL pitcher to do so in the post-1920 live-ball era, and Paul finished with 19, for a total of 49. The Cards needed them all to edge the Giants for the pennant, setting up a matchup with the American League champion Detroit Tigers. After the season, Dean was awarded the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award.

Dean was known for antics which inspired his nickname. In time, perception became reality. In Game 4 of the 1934 World Series against Detroit, Dean was sent to first base as a pinch runner. The next batter hit a potential double play ground ball. Intent on avoiding the double play, Dean threw himself in front of the throw to first. The ball struck him on the head, and Dean was knocked unconscious and taken to a hospital. Dean later told reporters, &quot;They X-rayed my head and found nothing&quot;. The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; and the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; merely stated that the X-rays &quot;revealed no lasting injury.&quot; 

Although the Tigers went on to win the game 10–4, Dean recovered in time to pitch in Game 5, which he lost. After the Cardinals won Game 6, Dean came back and pitched a complete-game shutout in Game 7 to win the game and the Series for the Cardinals. The Dean brothers accounted for all four wins, with two each.

While pitching for the NL in the 1937 All-Star Game, Dean faced Earl Averill of the American League Cleveland Indians. Averill hit a line drive back at the mound, hitting Dean on the foot. Told that his big toe was fractured, Dean responded, &quot;Fractured, hell, the damn thing&#x27;s broken!&quot; Coming back too soon from the injury, Dean changed his pitching motion to avoid landing as hard on his sore toe enough to affect his mechanics. As a result, he hurt his arm, losing his great fastball. At the time Dean was injured he sported a 12–7 record. He finished the season 13–10.

===Chicago Cubs (1938–1941)===
By , Dean&#x27;s arm had not recovered. Hopeful it would, Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley ordered scout Clarence &quot;Pants&quot; Rowland to buy Dean&#x27;s contract at any cost. On April 16, Rowland obtained Dean in a trade for three players (pitchers Clyde Shoun and Curt Davis and outfielder Tuck Stainback) plus $185,000 in cash - an enormous sum then. In limited use Dean proved exceptional - going 7-1 and posting a 1.81 ERA, by far the best of his career - helping the Cubs win the 1938 National League pennant. The Cubs had been in third place, six games behind the first place Pittsburgh Pirates. By September 27, with one week left in the season, the Cubs had battled back to within a game and a half of the Pirates in the National League standings as the two teams met for a crucial three-game series.

Dean pitched the opening game of the series and with an ailing arm, relied more on his experience and grit to defeat the Pirates by a score of 2–1. Dean would later call it the greatest outing of his career. The victory cut the Pirates&#x27; lead to a half game and, set the stage for one of baseball&#x27;s most memorable moments when in the next game of the series, Cubs player-manager, Gabby Hartnett, hit his famous &quot;Homer in the Gloamin&#x27;&quot; to put the Cubs into first place. The Cubs clinched the pennant three days later. Dean pitched gamely in Game 2 of the 1938 World Series before losing to the New York Yankees in what became known as &quot;Ol&#x27; Diz&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;.

Returning to the Cubs in 1939, Dean made 19 appearances (13 starts) resulting in a 6–4 record with 7 complete games, 2 shutouts, and a still well above league average 3.36 ERA. The team finished fourth in the NL. Beginning to fail badly, he was limited to just 10 games (nine starts) in 1940 and posted a 3–3 record with a 5.17 ERA, as the Cubs finished fifth in the league. He appeared in a single game during the 1941 season, pitching just one inning while allowing three runs. In mid-May, he announced his retirement as a player.

In 1942, Dean appeared in one game for the Superior Blues, a Class C team in the Northern League; as the starting pitcher, he allowed three runs in two innings, and then played in the outfield.

===Semi-professional appearance===
In July 1943, Dean agreed to pitch in a semipro game between the Green Sox of Fremont, Ohio, and the Detroit Cubs. His opponent was popular Negro Leagues pitcher and funnyman Peanuts Davis, who had been playing for the Cincinnati Clowns previously. The game, played in Toledo, drew a large crowd that expected to see a pitching duel. However, Davis was driven from the mound after one inning. Dean pitched the first four innings, giving up four hits and one run, and then played in right field for the remainder of the game, which the Green Sox won, 14–5.

===St. Louis Browns (1947)===
====One-game comeback====
Dean made a one-game major-league comeback on September 28, 1947. After retiring as a player, the still-popular Dean was hired as a broadcaster by the perennially cash-poor St. Louis Browns to drum up some badly needed publicity. After broadcasting several poor pitching performances in a row, he grew frustrated, saying on the air, &quot;Doggone it, I can pitch better than nine out of the ten guys on this staff!&quot; The wives of the Browns pitchers complained, and management, needing to sell tickets somehow, took him up on his offer and had him pitch the last game of the season versus the Chicago White Sox. At age 37, Dean pitched four innings, allowing no runs, and rapped a single in his only at-bat. Rounding first base, he pulled his hamstring. Returning to the broadcast booth at the end of the game, he said, &quot;I said I can pitch better than nine of the ten guys on the staff, and I can. But I&#x27;m done. Talking&#x27;s my game now, and I&#x27;m just glad that muscle I pulled wasn&#x27;t in my throat.&quot;

==Broadcasting career==
Following his playing career, Dean became a well-known radio and television sportscaster, calling baseball for the Cardinals (1941–1946), Browns (1941–1948), Yankees (1950–1951), and Atlanta Braves (1966–1968) and nationally with Mutual (1952), ABC (1953–1954), and CBS (1955–1965), where he teamed first with Buddy Blattner then with Pee Wee Reese. As a broadcaster, Dean was famous for his wit and his often-colorful butchering of the English language. Much like football star-turned-sportscaster Terry Bradshaw years later, he chose to build on, rather than counter, his image as a not-too-bright country boy, as a way of entertaining fans: &quot;The Good Lord was good to me. He gave me a strong right arm, a good body, and a weak mind.&quot; He once saw Browns outfielder Al Zarilla slide into a base, and said, &quot;Zarilla slud into third!&quot; &quot;Slud&quot; instead of &quot;slid&quot; became a frequently-used Dean expression. Thanks to baseball fan Charles Schulz, another Dean expression found its way into a &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip, as Lucy commented on a batter who swung at a pitch outside the strike zone: &quot;He shouldn&#x27;t hadn&#x27;t ought-a swang!&quot;

While doing a game on CBS, Dean once said, over the open mic, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re calling this the &quot;Game of the Week&quot;. There&#x27;s a much better game, Dodgers and Giants, over on NBC.&quot; Every so often, he would sign off by saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t fail to miss tomorrow&#x27;s game!&quot; During rain delays, he was famous for off-key renditions of the &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot;. These manglings of the language only endeared Dean to fans, being a precursor of such beloved tongue-tangled ballplayers-turned-broadcasters as Ralph Kiner, Herb Score, and Jerry Coleman.

An English teacher once wrote to him, complaining that he shouldn&#x27;t use the word &quot;ain&#x27;t&quot; on the air, as it was a bad example to children. On the air, Dean said, &quot;A lot of folks who ain&#x27;t sayin&#x27; &#x27;ain&#x27;t,&#x27; ain&#x27;t eatin&#x27;. So, Teach, you learn &#x27;em English, and I&#x27;ll learn &#x27;em baseball.&quot;

In the 1950s, Dean appeared in guest roles on &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot; on CBS and on &quot;The Guy Mitchell Show&quot; on ABC.

==Later life and death==

In October 1961, Dean announced that a company with which he was associated as vice-president, Dizzy Dean Enterprises, would construct a $350,000 charcoal briquette plant in Pachuta, Mississippi shortly after the beginning of 1962. The plant was anticipated to use $200,000 worth of low-quality hardwood scraps each year in the production of 10,000 tons of briquets annually when fully on line.

After leaving sportscasting in the late 1960s, Dean retired with his wife, Patricia, to her hometown of Bond, Mississippi.

After retiring to Mississippi, Dean was investigated for his role in an interstate gambling ring but was ultimately not charged. The indictments handed down in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in 1970 named him and his nephew, Paul, as co-conspirators but not defendants. He denied any wrongdoing and cooperated as a witness.

Dean died July 17, 1974, at age 64 in Reno, Nevada, of a heart attack, and was buried in the Bond Cemetery. Dean&#x27;s home in Bond was named &quot;Deanash&quot;, a combination of his name and his wife&#x27;s maiden name (Nash); it was willed by Dean&#x27;s wife to the Mississippi Baptist Convention, which operates foster homes for children in a rural setting.

==Recognition==

&quot;The Pride of St. Louis&quot;, a motion picture loosely based on Dean&#x27;s career, was released in 1952. Dan Dailey portrayed Dean. Chet Huntley, who would later gain fame as an NBC News anchorman, played an uncredited role in the movie as Dean&#x27;s radio announcing sidekick.

A Dizzy Dean Museum was established at 1152 Lakeland Drive in Jackson, Mississippi. The Dean exhibit is now part of the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame &amp; Museum, located adjacent to Smith-Wills Stadium, a former minor-league baseball park.

In the 1971 sci-fi movie &quot;The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler&quot;, Leslie Nielsen answers incorrectly &quot;Dizzy Dean, 1935&quot; when asked in which season did a pitcher win 30 games before Denny McLain.

Dean was mentioned in the 1949 poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash:

Dean was referenced in the classic TV sitcom &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; by the character Ed Norton, who justified mooching a second dinner off of Ralph Kramden by saying, &quot;Look, let&#x27;s face it, Ralph. Dizzy Dean warms up in the bullpen before the game, but he still pitches.&quot; Later in the scene, when tensions rise, Kramden quips &quot;Shut up, Dizzy Dean, and eat your spaghetti!&quot;

Dean was parodied in the 1936 Merrie Melodies cartoon &quot;Boulevardier from the Bronx&quot; with a character named Dizzy Dan.

Dean was also referenced in the 1939 Laurel and Hardy film &quot;A Chump at Oxford&quot;, when Oliver Hardy unknowingly called the character of the actual dean at the famous Oxford University a &quot;dizzy dean&quot;.

Dean is also featured prominently in some versions of Abbott and Costello&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s on First?&quot; comedy sketch. In the sketch, Abbott is explaining to Costello that many ballplayers have unusual nicknames including Dizzy Dean, his brother Daffy Dean, and their &quot;French cousin Goofé Dean&quot; (&quot;goofy&quot; pronounced with a French accent).

Actor Ben Jones wrote and performed a one-man play about Dean, entitled &quot;Ol&#x27; Diz&quot;.

The United States Congress designated the U.S. Post Office in Wiggins, Mississippi as the &quot;Jay Hanna &#x27;Dizzy&#x27; Dean Post Office&quot; in 2000 by Public Law 106–236. On October 22, 2007, a rest area on U.S. Route 49 in Wiggins, Mississippi, south of Dean&#x27;s home in Bond, was named &quot;Dizzy Dean Rest Area&quot; after Dean.

In Morrison Bluff, Arkansas, about south of Clarksville, there is a restaurant, Porky&#x27;s, with Dizzy Dean memorabilia.

In 2015, author Carolyn E. Mueller and illustrator Ed Koehler published an animated book titled &quot;Dizzy Dean and the Gashouse Gang&quot; (). The book showcases the antics of Dizzy and his brother Paul Dean, Joe Medwick, Pepper Martin, player/manager Frankie Frisch, and the 1934 St. Louis Cardinals season in their quest to win their third World Series.

Dizzy Dean in one of the characters of &quot;Mr. Vértigo&quot;, the novel written by the American author Paul Auster in 1994.

Branch Rickey, who was the Cardinals&#x27; general manager during Dean&#x27;s time with the club, had a high regard for both Dean&#x27;s talent and his character, while remaining bemused by Dean&#x27;s casual interpersonal skills. After one of their talks, the well-educated Rickey said, &quot;Tell me why I spent four mortal hours today conversing with a person named Dizzy Dean.&quot;

==Career statistics==

Dean was an effective hitting pitcher. He posted a .225 batting average (161-for-717) with 76 runs, 8 home runs, 76 RBI and 5 stolen bases. In five World Series pitching appearances (he was also used in one game as a pinch runner), he hit .333 (5-for-15) with 3 runs, 2 doubles and 1 RBI. Defensively, he was about average, recording a .960 fielding percentage which was one point higher than the league average at his position.

<text>The Chinatown–International District (abbreviated as CID) is a neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. It is the center of the city&#x27;s Asian American community. Within the district are the three neighborhoods known as Chinatown, Japantown and Little Saigon, named for the concentration of businesses owned by people of Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese descent, respectively. The geographic area also once included Manilatown.

It was the third community for the city&#x27;s Chinese and Japanese immigrants, who were driven out of other locations around modern-day Pioneer Square during the late 19th century. A new Chinatown was established shortly after the Jackson Regrade in 1907, which leveled terrain near King Street Station, alongside a Japantown in the same vicinity. The city&#x27;s Japantown declined following the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, while Vietnamese immigration after the Vietnam War led to the establishment of Little Saigon in the 1970s. The construction of Interstate 5 through the neighborhood in the 1960s and the Kingdome nearby in 1976 led to further strain on the area.

The Seattle Chinatown Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The area was named the &quot;International District&quot; by the city government since the mid-20th century, but the term&#x27;s use is controversial among the Chinese American community. Like many other areas of Seattle, the neighborhood is multiethnic, but the majority of its residents are of Chinese ethnicity. It is one of eight historic neighborhoods recognized by the City of Seattle. CID has a mix of residences and businesses and is a tourist attraction for its ethnic Asian culture and landmarks.

==Location==
The CID boundaries are defined as 4th Avenue South (on the west) to Rainier Avenue (on the east) and from Yesler Way (north) to Charles Street/Dearborn (south). The CID is bordered by the neighborhoods of Pioneer Square and SoDo to the west of 4th Ave S; Rainier Valley on the east side of Rainier; Beacon Hill and the Industrial District to the south of Charles/Dearborn; and downtown and First Hill to the north of Yesler.

Within the CID are three distinct neighborhoods: Chinatown, Japantown, and Little Saigon. The Seattle Chinatown Historic District, so designated by the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1986, is roughly south of Jackson and west of I-5, with Hing Hay Park at its heart. In the present day, Japantown is centered on 6th Avenue and Main Street and Little Saigon&#x27;s main nexus is 12th Avenue South and South Jackson Street.

==History==

===Predecessors in Seattle===

Chinese immigrants first came to the Pacific Northwest in the 1850s, and by the 1860s, some had settled in Seattle. The first in the city was Chin Chun Hock, a domestic worker who arrived in 1860 and later founded a general store and hotel. Many of the first Chinese immigrants to Washington came from Guangdong province, especially Taishan. By 1873, there was an estimated 100 Chinese residents in Seattle, out of the city&#x27;s total population of 2,000. The first Chinese quarters were near Yesler&#x27;s Mill on the waterfront, which included several business that opened in the late 1860s. The Chinese quarter grew to include residences and shifted uphill from the waterfront into leased buildings around Washington Street. The influx of Chinese immigrants was slowed by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Following an economic crisis a few years later, a group of white Seattle residents drove out the city&#x27;s Chinese population in February 1886. However, some took shelter with Native Americans on the reservations while others came under the protection of white employers and a judge.

The Great Seattle Fire of 1889 further hindered the community. Eventually, the Chinese re-established new quarters farther inland, along Washington St. and Second Avenue South. This was the second Chinatown. Land values rose, especially with impending construction of the Smith Tower, and the people of Chinatown moved again, to the present and third location along King Street. Only the Hop Sing Tong managed to retain its building on 2nd and Washington. It sold this building about 2006 in order to purchase the former China Gate building at 516 7th Ave S in the current Chinatown.

Near the end of the 19th century, Japanese immigrants also began arriving, settling on the south side of the district on the other side of the railroad tracks. Part of present-day Dearborn Street, between 8th and 12th avenues, was known as Mikado Street, after the Japanese word for &quot;emperor.&quot; Japanese Americans developed Nihonmachi, or Japantown, on Main Street, two blocks north of King Street. By the mid-1920s, Nihonmachi extended from 4th Avenue along Main to 7th Avenue, with clusters of businesses along Jackson, King, Weller, Lane, and Dearborn streets.

===20th century===
The Jackson Regrade began in 1907; workers leveled hills and used the resulting fill to reclaim tidal flats, making travel to downtown easier. As downtown property values rose, the Chinese were forced to other areas. By the early 1900s, a new Chinatown began to develop along King Street. In 1910, Goon Dip, a prominent businessman in Seattle&#x27;s Chinese American community, led a group of Chinese Americans to form the Kong Yick Investment Company, a benefit society. Their funding and efforts led to the construction of two buildings—the East Kong Yick Building and the West Kong Yick Building.

Meanwhile, Filipino Americans began arriving to replace the Chinese dock workers, who had moved inland. According to &quot;Pamana I,&quot; a history of Filipino Americans in Seattle, they settled along First Hill and the hotels and boarding houses of Chinatown and Japantown beginning in the early 1920s. They were attracted to work as contract laborers in agriculture and salmon canneries. Among them was Filipino author Carlos Bulosan, who wrote of his experiences and those of his countrymen in his novel &quot;America Is In The Heart&quot; (1946). By the 1930s, a &#x27;Manilatown&#x27; had been established near the corner of Maynard and King.

In 1942, under the auspices of Executive Order 9066, the federal government forcibly removed and detained people of Japanese ancestry from Seattle and the West Coast in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Authorities moved them to inland internment camps, where they lived from 1942 to 1946. Most of Seattle&#x27;s Japanese residents were sent to Minidoka in Idaho. After the war, many returned to the Pacific Northwest but relocated to the suburbs or other districts in Seattle. A remaining vestige of the old community is the office of the &quot;North American Post&quot;, a Japanese-language newspaper founded in 1902. Another is the Panama Hotel, which was proclaimed a National Treasure in 2015 with a prior listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Maneki, one of the oldest Japanese restaurants in the United States, reopened in its storage space after its original building was looted and vandalized during the war. Uwajimaya, originally a Japantown store, moved down the hill into Chinatown.

African Americans moved to Seattle in the Great Migration, mostly out of the South, to work in the war industry during World War II, occupying many of the houses left vacant by the internment of the Japanese Americans. They filled the empty businesses along Jackson Street with notable jazz clubs.

In 1951, Seattle Mayor William D. Devin proclaimed the area &quot;International Center&quot; because of the diversity of people who resided and worked in the vicinity. Businesswoman and later city councilwoman Ruby Chow and others criticized the use of &quot;international&quot; for masking Chinese American history. The use of &quot;International District&quot; by the city remains controversial.

Seattle&#x27;s first neighborhood advocacy group, the Jackson Street Community Council, opposed the construction of an interstate highway through the area. Despite protest, many Chinese and Japanese buildings and businesses were destroyed for the construction of Interstate 5 in the 1960s. Ethnic Asians formed new civic organizations (as compared to the traditional Chinese family associations, tongs and social clubs) serve needs ranging from community health, care of the elderly, information and referrals, counseling, historic preservation, marketing of the area, and building low-income housing. The construction of the Kingdome in 1972 further boxed in the neighborhood, leading to renewed protests over the community&#x27;s lack of representation, including an impromptu demonstration at the stadium&#x27;s groundbreaking ceremony on November 2, 1972.

With the fall of Saigon in 1975, a new wave of immigrants from Vietnam and Southeast Asia established Seattle&#x27;s Little Saigon east of I-5. Many of these immigrants were of Chinese descent. Vietnamese pho was introduced to the city in 1982 with the opening of Phở Bắc, a restaurant most famous for its boat-like shape. Meanwhile, Little Saigon gained its first grocery store with the opening of Viet-Wah in 1981; it was joined by Lam&#x27;s Seafood Market in 1991 and Hau Hau Market in 1995.

The worst mass murder in the history of Seattle took place at the Wah Mee Club on Maynard Alley on February 18, 1983. Thirteen people were killed.

In 1986, a portion of Chinatown and Japantown was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the &quot;Seattle Chinatown Historic District.&quot; That year the Wing Luke Memorial Museum moved to 7th Avenue, a location it would occupy for two decades.

In 1999, the City Council approved the &quot;Chinatown/International District Urban Village Strategic Plan&quot; for the future of the neighborhood. This plan, agreed to by all major organizations in the CID, led to City Ordinance 119297. This ordinance enshrined the three neighborhoods of Chinatown, Japantown, Little Saigon and the Chinatown Historic District into one larger neighborhood with a compromised name. Since then, the often conflicting interests of development, preservation and the conversion of old buildings to low-income housing have clashed as office developments (e.g., Union Station) and market-rate housing developments are overwhelmed by drastic increases in low-income housing stock. In addition, controversy erupted over vacating S. Lane Street as part of a large redevelopment by the private business Uwajimaya. Protesters formed the Save Lane Street organization and insisted as business owners they supported re-development, but opposed vacating a public street for a private business use. After losing a lawsuit filed over the matter, the Save Lane Street group dissolved. Activist groups also fought an attempt to build a McDonald&#x27;s at the entrance of the neighborhood, which resulted in the company&#x27;s withdrawal.

=== 21st century ===
Construction on a paifang for the neighborhood began in 2006 and the Historic Chinatown Gate was unveiled on February 9, 2008. It stands at the west end of South King Street. It is 45 feet tall and made from steel and plaster. The Wing Luke Museum moved to the East Kong Yick Building in 2008.

As part of projects intended to maintain the identity of the neighborhood, the Seattle Department of Transportation installed bilingual street name signs at its intersections starting in the summer of 2013. The Chinatown and Japantown neighborhoods received them with the initial installation; the Little Saigon neighborhood did not have the signs installed until August 2016. The signs feature a top section with the street&#x27;s legal English names in white on a green background and a bottom section with white translated text in the neighborhoods&#x27; respective native languages on a brown background; traditional Chinese is featured in Chinatown while Japanese is featured in Japantown, with Vietnamese featured in Little Saigon.

On February 28, 2019, police officers arrested five spa owners/operators and conducted a raid on 11 massage parlors, the majority of them on South Jackson Street within the neighborhood, in connection with an investigation into an alleged prostitution and money-laundering scheme that began in January 2015. 26 Chinese women, ranging in age from their late 20s to early 60s, were removed from the parlors; many of them were new arrivals that were not fluent in English. According to police and court documents, many of the women worked 14-hour shifts for six to seven days per week in decrepit conditions.

==== Rise of homelessness and exodus ====
The neighborhood has experienced gentrification since the early 2000s owing to a dramatic increase in overall demand for real estate development in the city. A May 2016 report from the National Coalition of Asian Pacific American Community Development revealed that overall city rents outgrew incomes by 45 percent from 2000 to 2014. As a result, a significant portion of its long-time residents have been displaced from their residences due to their inability to pay the increased rent, subsequently enduring homelessness due to the insufficient amount of affordable housing in the neighborhood. The Nickelsville homeless encampment, established in 2008, moved in September 2014 to a site on South Dearborn Street opposite the onramp to northbound Interstate 5. The property owner evicted the encampment in February 2016 after its leader was ousted the year before due to on-site conflict, invalidating the agreement made with the owner; 16 remaining residents were cleared out peacefully on March 11.

In a bid to address the city&#x27;s worsening homeless crisis, Mayor Ed Murray announced on February 8, 2017, that the city would open a 24/7 homeless shelter similar to the navigation center opened by officials in San Francisco in 2015. After a search dating back to the previous June, the city selected the Pearl Warren Building on 12th Avenue South in the Little Saigon area, which was already hosting a traditional men&#x27;s homeless shelter at the time. The selection was received with mixed to negative reaction from the Little Saigon community; many in the community were surprised by the announcement, claiming that the city did not ask them for input. While members stated that they were understanding of the need to handle the crisis, they held concerns about the potential for crime and sanitation issues. Backlash from the community, which included letters sent to him and protests outside Seattle City Hall, prompted Murray to announce on April 24 that he would halt the project until he could devise a plan that would satisfy community members. The center opened on July 12 with 75 beds and within its assigned budget of $2.7 million.

Impromptu encampments were still prevalent within the neighborhood. After city officials cleared an encampment of around 20 shelters in a neighboring stairwell on April 22, 2020. Many campers migrated one block over to South Weller Street, which was lined with more than 30 shelters. The clearing occurred despite strict guidelines put in place with the COVID-19 pandemic due to the difficulty encountered by the Seattle Police Department in patrolling the stairwell. , there were 15 encampments around the area, with severe public safety issues surrounding their presence cited as a major reason for a mass exodus of businesses from the neighborhood. More than 19 businesses had shuttered operations in the area in that year, with Viet Wah&#x27;s closure on September 30 among the most notable occurrences. In an editorial regarding the Little Saigon section for &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, an executive director of a local nonprofit (that also elected to move out) argued that private developers were contributing to the exodus by neglecting to maintain their properties in seeking a market rebound. According to a 2021 economic study of the neighborhood section, it was “rated as having high risk for displacement” owing to rapid residential growth, with around 1,145 new housing units built over the past four years.

In 2023, it was the first neighborhood in the state to be included in the National Trust for Historic Preservation&#x27;s annual list of America&#x27;s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. The Chinatown neighborhood in Philadelphia was also included in the list, with the organization noting that less than half of such neighborhoods were still remaining out of 83 identified nationwide.

== Culture ==

The neighborhood hosts a Lunar New Year festival near the East Asian Lunar New Year; Dragon Fest, a pan-Asian American festival, during the summer; and a night market in early fall. The nonprofit Friends of Little Saigon hosts an annual Celebrate Little Saigon event that celebrates Vietnamese culture.

Certain neighborhood buildings in CID incorporate Chinese architectural designs such as balconies on the second or third floors or tile roofs. The neighborhood also has public art installations by artists such as George Tsutakawa and Norie Sato. Artists Meng Huang and Heather Presler installed Chinese dragon sculptures on lampposts along Jackson Street in 2002.

<text>Global cooling was a conjecture, especially during the 1970s, of imminent cooling of the Earth culminating in a period of extensive glaciation, due to the cooling effects of aerosols or orbital forcing. 
Some press reports in the 1970s speculated about continued cooling; these did not accurately reflect the scientific literature of the time, which was generally more concerned with warming from an enhanced greenhouse effect.

In the mid 1970s, the limited temperature series available suggested that the temperature had decreased for several decades up to then. As longer time series of higher quality became available, it became clear that global temperature showed significant increases overall.

== Introduction: general awareness and concern ==

By the 1970s, scientists were becoming increasingly aware that estimates of global temperatures showed cooling since 1945, as well as the possibility of large scale warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases. In the scientific papers which considered climate trends of the 21st century, fewer than 10% were inclined towards future cooling, while most papers predicted future warming. The general public had little awareness of carbon dioxide&#x27;s effects on climate, but &quot;Science News&quot; in May 1959 forecast a 25% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in the 150 years from 1850 to 2000, with a consequent warming trend. The actual increase in this period was 29%. Paul R. Ehrlich mentioned global warming from greenhouse gases as a counterforce to the cooling effect of aerosols in 1968. By the time the idea of global cooling reached the public press in the mid-1970s temperatures had stopped falling, and there was concern in the climatological community about carbon dioxide&#x27;s warming effects. In response to such reports, the World Meteorological Organization issued a warning in June 1976 that &quot;a very significant warming of global climate&quot; was probable.

Currently, there are some concerns about the possible regional cooling effects of a slowdown or shutdown of thermohaline circulation, which might be provoked by an increase of fresh water mixing into the North Atlantic due to glacial melting. The probability of this occurring is generally considered to be very low, and the IPCC notes, &quot;even in models where the THC weakens, there is still warming over Europe. For example, in all AOGCM integrations where the radiative forcing is increasing, the sign of the temperature change over north-west Europe is positive.&quot;

==Physical mechanisms==

The cooling period is reproduced by current (1999 on) global climate models that include the physical effects of sulfate aerosols, and there is now general agreement that aerosol effects were the dominant cause of the mid-20th century cooling. At the time there were two physical mechanisms that were most frequently advanced to cause cooling: aerosols and orbital forcing.

===Aerosols===

Human activity — mostly as a by-product of fossil fuel combustion, partly by land use changes — increases the number of tiny particles (aerosols) in the atmosphere. These have a direct effect: they effectively increase the planetary albedo, thus cooling the planet by reducing the solar radiation reaching the surface; and an indirect effect: they affect the properties of clouds by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. In the early 1970s some speculated that this cooling effect might dominate over the warming effect of the CO2 release: see discussion of Rasool and Schneider (1971), below. As a result of observations and a switch to cleaner fuel burning, this no longer seems likely; current scientific work indicates that global warming is far more likely. Although the temperature drops foreseen by this mechanism have now been discarded in light of better theory and the observed warming, aerosols are thought to have contributed a cooling tendency (outweighed by increases in greenhouse gases) and also have contributed to global dimming.

===Orbital forcing===
Orbital forcing refers to the slow, cyclical changes in the tilt of Earth&#x27;s axis and shape of its orbit. These cycles alter the total amount of sunlight reaching the Earth by a small amount and affect the timing and intensity of the seasons. This mechanism is thought to be responsible for the timing of the ice age cycles, and understanding of the mechanism was increasing rapidly in the mid-1970s.

The paper of Hays, Imbrie, and Shackleton &quot;Variations in the Earth&#x27;s Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages&quot; qualified its predictions with the remark that &quot;forecasts must be qualified in two ways. First, they apply only to the natural component of future climatic trends - and not to anthropogenic effects such as those due to the burning of fossil fuels. Second, they describe only the long-term trends, because they are linked to orbital variations with periods of 20,000 years and longer. Climatic oscillations at higher frequencies are not predicted ... the results indicate that the long-term trend over the next 20,000 years is towards extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation and cooler climate&quot;.

The idea that ice ages cycles were predictable appears to have become conflated with the idea that another one was due &quot;soon&quot; - perhaps because much of this study was done by geologists, who are accustomed to dealing with very long time scales and use &quot;soon&quot; to refer to periods of thousands of years. A strict application of the Milankovitch theory does not allow the prediction of a &quot;rapid&quot; ice age onset (i.e., less than a century or two) since the fastest orbital period is about 20,000 years. Some creative ways around this were found, notably one championed by Nigel Calder under the name of &quot;snowblitz&quot;, but these ideas did not gain wide acceptance.

The length of the current interglacial temperature peak is similar to the length of the preceding interglacial peak (Sangamon/Eem), and so it could be concluded that we might be nearing the end of this warm period. This conclusion would be mistaken. Firstly, because the lengths of previous interglacials were not particularly regular; see figure. Petit et al. note that &quot;interglacials 5.5 and 9.3 are different from the Holocene, but similar to each other in duration, shape and amplitude. During each of these two events, there is a warm period of 4 kyr followed by a relatively rapid cooling&quot;. Secondly, future orbital variations will not closely resemble those of the past.

==Concern pre-1970s==
In 1923, there was concern about a new ice age and Captain Donald Baxter MacMillan sailed toward the Arctic sponsored by the National Geographical Society to look for evidence of advancing glaciers.

In 1926, a Berlin astronomer was predicting global cooling but that it was &quot;ages away&quot;.

Concerns that a new ice age was approaching was revived in the 1950s. During the Cold War, there were concerns by Harry Wexler that setting off atom bombs could be hastening a new ice age from a nuclear winter scenario.

J. Murray Mitchell showed as early as 1963 a multidecadal cooling since about 1940. At a conference on climate change held in Boulder, Colorado in 1965, evidence supporting Milankovitch cycles triggered speculation on how the calculated small changes in sunlight might somehow trigger ice ages. In 1966, Cesare Emiliani predicted that &quot;a new glaciation will begin within a few thousand years.&quot; In his 1968 book &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;, Paul R. Ehrlich wrote &quot;The greenhouse effect is being enhanced now by the greatly increased level of carbon dioxide ... [this] is being countered by low-level clouds generated by contrails, dust, and other contaminants ... At the moment we cannot predict what the overall climatic results will be of our using the atmosphere as a garbage dump.&quot;

==Concern in the 1970s==

===1970s awareness===

Concern peaked in the early 1970s, though &quot;the possibility of anthropogenic warming dominated the peer-reviewed literature even then&quot; (a cooling period began in 1945, and two decades of a cooling trend suggested a trough had been reached after several decades of warming). This peaking concern is partially attributable to the fact much less was then known about world climate and causes of ice ages. Climate scientists were aware that predictions based on this trend were not possible - because the trend was poorly studied and not understood (for example see reference). Despite that, in the popular press the possibility of cooling was reported generally without the caveats present in the scientific reports, and &quot;unusually severe winters in Asia and parts of North America in 1972 and 1973 ... pushed the issue into the public consciousness&quot;.

In the 1970s, the compilation of records to produce hemispheric, or global, temperature records had just begun.

Spencer R. Weart&#x27;s history of &quot;The Discovery of Global Warming&quot; says that: &quot;While neither scientists nor the public could be sure in the 1970s whether the world was warming or cooling, &quot;people were increasingly inclined to believe that global climate was on the move, and in no small way&quot;&quot; [emphasis added].

On January 11, 1970, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;Colder Winters Held Dawn of New Ice Age&quot;.

In 1972, Emiliani warned &quot;Man&#x27;s activity may either precipitate this new ice age or lead to substantial or even total melting of the ice caps&quot;.

Also in 1972, a group of glacial-epoch experts at a conference agreed that &quot;the natural end of our warm epoch is undoubtedly near&quot;; but the volume of Quaternary Research reporting on the meeting said that &quot;the basic conclusion to be drawn from the discussions in this section is that the knowledge necessary for understanding the mechanism of climate change is still lamentably inadequate&quot;. George Kukla and Robert Matthews, in a &quot;Science&quot; write-up of a conference, asked when and how the current interglacial would end; concluding that, unless there were impacts from future human activity, &quot;Global cooling and related rapid changes of environment, substantially exceeding the fluctuations experienced by man in historical times, must be expected within the next few millennia or even centuries&quot;, but many other scientists doubted these conclusions.

=== 1970 SCEP report ===

The 1970 Study of Critical Environmental Problems reported the possibility of warming from increased carbon dioxide, but no concerns about cooling, setting a lower bound on the beginning of interest in &quot;global cooling&quot;.

===1971 to 1975: papers on warming and cooling factors===
By 1971, studies indicated that human caused air pollution was spreading, but there was uncertainty as to whether aerosols would cause warming or cooling, and whether or not they were more significant than rising levels. J. Murray Mitchell still viewed humans as &quot;innocent bystanders&quot; in the cooling from the 1940s to 1970, but in 1971 his calculations suggested that rising emissions could cause significant cooling after 2000, though he also argued that emissions could cause warming depending on circumstances. Calculations were too basic at this time to be trusted to give reliable results.

An early numerical computation of climate effects was published in the journal &quot;Science&quot; in July 1971 as a paper by S. Ichtiaque Rasool and Stephen H. Schneider, titled &quot;Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Aerosols: Effects of Large Increases on Global Climate&quot;.
The paper used rudimentary data and equations to compute the possible future effects of large increases in the densities in the atmosphere of two types of human environmental emissions:
# greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide;
# particulate pollution such as smog, some of which remains suspended in the atmosphere in aerosol form for years.
The paper suggested that the global warming due to greenhouse gases would tend to have less effect with greater densities, and while aerosol pollution could cause warming, it was likely that it would tend to have a cooling effect which increased with density. They concluded that &quot;An increase by only a factor of 4 in global aerosol background concentration may be sufficient to reduce the surface temperature by as much as 3.5 ° K. If sustained over a period of several years, such a temperature decrease over the whole globe is believed to be sufficient to trigger an ice age.&quot;

Both their equations and their data were badly flawed, as was soon pointed out by other scientists and confirmed by Schneider himself. In January 1972, Robert Jay Charlson et al. pointed out that with other reasonable assumptions, the model produced the opposite conclusion. The model made no allowance for changes in clouds or convection, and erroneously indicated that eight times as much would only cause 2 °C of warming. In a paper published in 1975, Schneider corrected the overestimate of aerosol cooling by checking data on the effects of dust produced by volcanoes. When the model included estimated changes in solar intensity, it gave a reasonable match to temperatures over the previous thousand years and its prediction was that &quot; warming dominates the surface temperature patterns soon after 1980.&quot;

===1972 and 1974 National Science Board===
The National Science Board&#x27;s &quot;Patterns and Perspectives in Environmental Science&quot; report of 1972 discussed the cyclical behavior of climate, and the understanding at the time that the planet was entering a phase of cooling after a warm period. &quot;Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end, to be followed by a long period of considerably colder temperatures leading into the next glacial age some 20,000 years from now.&quot; But it also continued; &quot;However, it is possible, or even likely, that human interference has already altered the environment so much that the climatic pattern of the near future will follow a different path.&quot;

The board&#x27;s report of 1974, &quot;Science And The Challenges Ahead&quot;, continued on this theme. &quot;During the last 20-30 years, world temperature has fallen, irregularly at first but more sharply over the last decade.&quot; Discussion of cyclic glacial periods does not feature in this report. Instead it is the role of humans that is central to the report&#x27;s analysis.
&quot;The cause of the cooling trend is not known with certainty. But there is increasing concern that man himself may be implicated, not only in the recent cooling trend but also in the warming temperatures over the last century&quot;. The report did not conclude whether carbon dioxide in warming, or agricultural and industrial pollution in cooling, are factors in the recent climatic changes, noting;
&quot;Before such questions as these can be resolved, major advances must be made in understanding the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere and oceans, and in measuring and tracing particulates through the system.&quot;

===1975 National Academy of Sciences report===
There also was a Report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) entitled, &quot;Understanding Climate Change: A Program for Action&quot;.

The report stated (p. 36) that, &quot;The average surface air temperature in the northern hemisphere increased from the 1880s until about 1940 and has been decreasing thereafter.&quot;

It also stated (p. 44) that, &quot;If both the and particulate inputs to the atmosphere grow at equal rates in the future, the widely differing atmospheric residence times of the two pollutants means that the particulate effect will grow in importance relative to that of .&quot;

The report did not predict whether the 25-year cooling trend would continue. It stated (Forward, p. v) that, &quot;we do not have a good quantitative understanding of our climate machine and what determines its course [so] it does not seem possible to predict climate&quot;, and (p. 2) &quot;The climates of the earth have always been changing, and they will doubtless continue to do so in the future. How large these future changes will be, and where and how rapidly they will occur, we do not know.&quot;

The Report&#x27;s &quot;program for action&quot; was a call for creation of a new National Climatic Research Program. It stated (p. 62), &quot;If we are to react rationally to the inevitable climatic changes of the future, and if we are ever to predict their future course, whether they are natural or man-induced, a far greater understanding of these changes is required than we now possess. It is, moreover, important that this knowledge be acquired as soon as possible.&quot; For that reason, it stated, &quot;the time has now come to initiate a broad and coordinated attack on the problem of climate and climatic change.&quot;

===1974 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article===
While these discussions were ongoing in scientific circles, other accounts appeared in the popular media. In their June 24, 1974, issue, &quot;Time&quot; presented an article titled &quot;Another Ice Age?&quot; that noted &quot;the atmosphere has been growing gradually cooler for the past three decades&quot; but noted that &quot;Some scientists ... think that the cooling trend may be only temporary.&quot;

===1975 &quot;Newsweek&quot; article===
An April 28, 1975, article in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine was titled &quot;The Cooling World&quot;, it pointed to &quot;ominous signs that the Earth&#x27;s weather patterns have begun to change&quot; and pointed to &quot;a drop of half a degree [Fahrenheit] in average ground temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere between 1945 and 1968.&quot; The article stated &quot;The evidence in support of these predictions [of global cooling] has now begun to accumulate so massively that meteorologists are hard-pressed to keep up with it.&quot; The &quot;Newsweek&quot; article did not state the cause of cooling; it stated that &quot;what causes the onset of major and minor ice ages remains a mystery&quot; and cited the NAS conclusion that &quot;not only are the basic scientific questions largely unanswered, but in many cases we do not yet know enough to pose the key questions.&quot;

The article mentioned the alternative solutions of &quot;melting the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting Arctic rivers&quot; but conceded these were not feasible. The &quot;Newsweek&quot; article concluded by criticizing government leaders: &quot;But the scientists see few signs that government leaders anywhere are even prepared to take the simple measures of stockpiling food or of introducing the variables of climatic uncertainty into economic projections of future food supplies ... The longer the planners (politicians) delay, the more difficult will they find it to cope with climatic change once the results become grim reality.&quot; The article emphasized sensational and largely unsourced consequences - &quot;resulting famines could be catastrophic&quot;, &quot;drought and desolation&quot;, &quot;the most devastating outbreak of tornadoes ever recorded&quot;, &quot;droughts, floods, extended dry spells, long freezes, delayed monsoons&quot;, &quot;impossible for starving peoples to migrate&quot;, &quot;the present decline has taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age.&quot;

On October 23, 2006, &quot;Newsweek&quot; issued a correction, over 31 years after the original article, stating that it had been &quot;so spectacularly wrong about the near-term future&quot; (though editor Jerry Adler stated that &quot;the story wasn&#x27;t &#x27;wrong&#x27; in the journalistic sense of &#x27;inaccurate.)

===Other 1970s sources===
Academic analysis of the peer-reviewed studies published at that time shows that most papers examining aspects of climate during the 1970s were either neutral or showed a warming trend.

In 1977, a popular book on the topic was published, called &quot;The Weather Conspiracy: The Coming of the New Ice Age&quot;.

===1979 WMO conference===

Later in the decade, at a WMO conference in 1979, F. Kenneth Hare reported:
==Late-20th-century cooling predictions==

===1980s===
Concerns about nuclear winter arose in the early 1980s from several reports. Similar speculations have appeared over effects due to catastrophes such as asteroid impacts and massive volcanic eruptions.

===1990s===
In 1991, a prediction by Carl Sagan and other scientists who had worked on the famous TTAPS study on nuclear winter that massive oil well fires in Kuwait would cause significant effects on climate was incorrect.

In January 1999, contrarian Patrick Michaels wrote a commentary offering to &quot;take even money that the 10 years ending on December 31, 2007, will show a statistically significant global cooling trend in temperatures measured by satellite&quot;, on the basis of his view that record temperatures in 1998 had been a blip. Indeed, over that period, satellite-measured temperatures never again approached their 1998 peak. Due to a sharp but temporary dip in temperatures in 1999–2000, a least-squares linear regression fit to the satellite temperature record showed little overall trend. The RSS satellite temperature record showed a slight cooling trend, but the UAH satellite temperature record showed a slight warming trend.

==Twenty-first century==
In 2003, the Office of Net Assessment at the United States Department of Defense was commissioned to produce a study on the likely and potential effects of abrupt modern climate change should a shutdown of thermohaline circulation occur. The study, conducted under ONA head Andrew Marshall, modelled its prospective climate change on the 8.2 kiloyear event, precisely because it was the middle alternative between the Younger Dryas and the Little Ice Age. Scientists said that &quot;abrupt climate change initiated by Greenland ice sheet melting is not a realistic scenario for the 21st century&quot;.

==Present level of knowledge==

The concern that cooler temperatures would continue, and perhaps at a faster rate, has been observed to be incorrect, as was assessed in the IPCC Third Assessment Report of 2001. More has to be learned about climate. However, the growing records have shown that short term cooling concerns have not been borne out.

As for the prospects of the end of the current interglacial, while the four most recent interglacials lasted about 10,000 years, the interglacial before that lasted around 28,000 years. Milankovitch-type calculations indicate that the present interglacial would probably continue for tens of thousands of years naturally in the absence of human perturbations. Other estimates (Loutre and Berger, based on orbital calculations) put the unperturbed length of the present interglacial at 50,000 years. A. Berger expressed the opinion in 2005 (EGU presentation) that the present CO2 perturbation will last long enough to suppress the next glacial cycle entirely. This is consistent with the prediction of David Archer and colleagues who argued in 2005 that the present level of will suspend the next glacial period for the next 500,000 years and will be the longest duration and intensity of the projected interglacial period and are longer than have been seen in the last 2.6 million years.

A 2015 report by the Past Global Changes Project, including Berger, says simulations show that a new glaciation is unlikely to happen within the next approximately 50,000 years, before the next strong drop in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation occurs &quot;if either atmospheric concentration
remains above 300 ppm or cumulative carbon emissions exceed 1000 Pg C&quot; (i.e. 1000 gigatonnes carbon). &quot;Only for an atmospheric content below the preindustrial level may a glaciation occur within the next 10 ka. ... Given the continued anthropogenic emissions, glacial inception is very unlikely to occur in the next 50 ka, because the timescale for and temperature reduction toward unperturbed values in the absence of active removal is very long [IPCC, 2013], and only weak precessional forcing occurs in the next two precessional cycles.&quot; (A precessional cycle is around 21,000 years, the time it takes for the perihelion to move all the way around the tropical year.)

As the NAS report indicates, scientific knowledge regarding climate change was more uncertain than it is today. At the time that Rasool and Schneider wrote their 1971 paper, climatologists had not yet recognized the significance of greenhouse gases other than water vapor and carbon dioxide, such as methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons. Early in that decade, carbon dioxide was the only widely studied human-influenced greenhouse gas. The attention drawn to atmospheric gases in the 1970s stimulated many discoveries in subsequent decades. As the temperature pattern changed, global cooling was of waning interest by 1979.

==The ice age fallacy==
A common argument used to dismiss the significance of human-caused climate change is to allege that scientists showed concerns about global cooling which did not materialise, and there is therefore no need to heed current scientific concerns about global warming. In a 1998 article promoting the Oregon Petition, Fred Singer argued that expert concerns about global warming should be dismissed on the basis that what he called &quot;the same hysterical fears&quot; had supposedly been expressed earlier about global cooling.
Bryan Walsh of &quot;Time&quot; magazine (2013) calls this argument &quot;the Ice Age Fallacy&quot;. Illustrating the argument, for several years an image had been circulated of a &quot;Time&quot; cover, supposedly dated 1977, showing a penguin above a cover story title &quot;How to Survive the Coming Ice Age&quot;. In March 2013, &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; published an article by David Rose, showing this same cover image, to support his claim that there was as much concern in the 1970s about a &quot;looming &#x27;ice age as there was now about global warming. After researching the authenticity of the magazine cover image, in July 2013, Walsh confirmed that the image was a hoax, modified from a 2007 cover story image for &quot;The Global Warming Survival Guide&quot;.

<doc id="295446" wikidata="Q61081" url="?curid=295446" title="Kumis">
<text>Kumis ( , ), alternatively spelled coumis or kumyz, also known as airag ( ), is a traditional fermented dairy product made from mare milk. The drink is important to the peoples of the Central and East Asian steppes, of Turkic and Mongolic origin: Kazakhs, Bashkirs, Kalmyks, Kyrgyz, Mongols, and Yakuts. Kumis was historically consumed by the Khitans, Jurchens, Magyars, and Han Chinese of North China as well.

&quot;Kumis&quot; is a dairy product similar to kefir, but is produced from a liquid starter culture, in contrast to the solid kefir &quot;grains&quot;. Because mare&#x27;s milk contains more sugars than cow&#x27;s or goat&#x27;s milk, when fermented, &quot;kumis&quot; has a higher, though still mild, alcohol content compared to kefir.

Even in the areas of the world where &quot;kumis&quot; is popular today, mare&#x27;s milk remains a very limited commodity. Industrial-scale production, therefore, generally uses cow&#x27;s milk, which is richer in fat and protein, but lower in lactose than the milk from a horse. Before fermentation, the cow&#x27;s milk is fortified in one of several ways. Sucrose may be added to allow a comparable fermentation. Another technique adds modified whey to better approximate the composition of mare&#x27;s milk.

==Terminology and etymology==
&quot;Kumis&quot; comes from the Turkic word &quot;kumïŕ&quot;. Gerard Clauson notes that &quot;kımız&quot; is found throughout the Turkic language family and cites the 11th-century appearance of the word in &quot;Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk&quot; written by Mahmud al-Kashgari in the Karakhanid language.

In Mongolia, the drink is called &quot;airag&quot; () or, in some areas, &quot;tsegee&quot;. William of Rubruck, in his 13th-century travels, calls the drink &quot;cosmos&quot; and describes its preparation among the Mongols.

==Production of mare milk==
A 1982 source reported 230,000 mares were kept in the Soviet Union specifically for producing milk to make into &quot;kumis&quot;. Rinchingiin Indra, writing about Mongolian dairying, says &quot;it takes considerable skill to milk a mare&quot; and describes the technique: the milker kneels on one knee, with a pail propped on the other, steadied by a string tied to an arm. One arm is wrapped behind the mare&#x27;s rear leg and the other in front. A foal starts the milk flow and is pulled away by another person, but left touching the mare&#x27;s side during the entire process.

In Mongolia, the milking season for horses traditionally runs between mid-June and early October. During one season, a mare produces approximately 1,000 to 1,200 litres of milk, of which about half is left to her foal.

==Production==
&quot;Kumis&quot; is made by fermenting raw milk (that is, unpasteurized) over the course of hours or days, often while stirring or churning. (The physical agitation has similarities to making butter.) During the fermentation, lactobacilli bacteria acidify the milk, and yeasts turn it into a carbonated and mildly alcoholic drink.

Traditionally, this fermentation took place in horse-hide containers, which might be left on the top of a yurt and turned over on occasion, or strapped to a saddle and joggled around over the course of a day&#x27;s riding. Today, a wooden vat or plastic barrel may be used in place of the leather container. In modern, controlled production, the initial fermentation takes two to five hours, at a temperature of around ; this may be followed by a cooler aging period. 

&quot;Kumis&quot; itself has a very low level of alcohol, between 0.7 and 2.5%, comparable to small beer, the common drink of medieval Europe that also helps to avoid the consumption of potentially contaminated water. &quot;Kumis&quot; can, however, be strengthened through freeze distillation, a technique Central Asian nomads are reported to have employed. It can also be made into the distilled beverage known as &quot;araka&quot; or &quot;arkhi&quot;.

==History==
Archaeological investigations of the Botai culture of ancient Kazakhstan have revealed traces of milk in bowls from the site of Botai, suggesting the domestication of dairy animals. No specific evidence for its fermentation has yet been found, but considering the location of the Botai culture and the nutritional properties of mare&#x27;s milk, the possibility is high.

&quot;Kumis&quot; is an ancient beverage. Herodotus, in his 5th-century BC &quot;Histories&quot;, describes the Scythians processing of mare&#x27;s milk:

Now the Scythians blind all their slaves, to use them in preparing their milk. The plan they follow is to thrust tubes made of bone, not unlike our musical pipes, up the vulva of the mare, and then to blow into the tubes with their mouths, some milking while the others blow. They say that they do this because when the veins of the animal are full of air, the udder is forced down. The milk thus obtained is poured into deep wooden casks, about which the blind slaves are placed, and then the milk is stirred round. That which rises to the top is drawn off, and considered the best part; the under portion is of less account.

This is widely believed to be the first description of ancient kumis-making. Apart from the idiosyncratic method of mare-milking, it matches up well enough with later accounts, such as this one given by 13th-century traveller William of Rubruck:

This &quot;cosmos&quot;, which is mare&#x27;s milk, is made in this wise. […] When they have got together a great quantity of milk, which is as sweet as cow&#x27;s as long as it is fresh, they pour it into a big skin or bottle, and they set to churning it with a stick […] and when they have beaten it sharply it begins to boil up like new wine and to sour or ferment, and they continue to churn it until they have extracted the butter. Then they taste it, and when it is mildly pungent, they drink it. It is pungent on the tongue like rapé wine when drunk, and when a man has finished drinking, it leaves a taste of milk of almonds on the tongue, and it makes the inner man most joyful and also intoxicates weak heads, and greatly provokes urine.

Rubruk also mentions that the Mongols prized a variety of kumis he calls &quot;caracomos&quot; (&quot;black comos&quot;), which was reserved for &quot;great lords&quot;.

In the 19th century, &quot;kumyss&quot; was used to treat gastrointestinal disorders.

==Consumption==

Strictly speaking, &quot;kumis&quot; is in its own category of alcoholic drinks, because it is made neither from fruit nor from grain. Technically, it is closer to wine than to beer, because the fermentation occurs directly from sugars (wine is usually fermented directly from fruit, whereas beer relies on starches, usually from grain, which convert to sugars by mashing). In terms of experience and traditional manner of consumption, however, it is much more comparable to beer and is even milder in alcoholic content than beer. It is arguably the region&#x27;s beer equivalent.

&quot;Kumis&quot; is very light in body compared to most dairy drinks. It has a unique, slightly sour flavor with a bite from the mild alcoholic content. The exact flavor is greatly variable between different producers.

&quot;Kumis&quot; is usually served cold or chilled. Traditionally it is sipped out of small, handle-less, bowl-shaped cups or saucers, called &quot;piyala&quot;. The serving of it is an essential part of Kyrgyz hospitality on the &quot;jayloo&quot; or high pasture, where they keep their herds of animals (horse, cattle, and sheep) during the summer phase of transhumance.

==Cultural role==
During the Yuan dynasty of China, kumis was essentially made to be the replacement of tea. Furthermore, Möngke Khan, the fourth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, had a drinking fountain made in his capital of Karakorum, including kumis alongside Chinese rice wine, Scandinavian mead, and Persian grape wine as a symbol of the empire&#x27;s diversity and size.

Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, is supposedly named after the paddle used to churn the fermenting milk.

The famous Russian writer Leo Tolstoy in &quot;A Confession&quot; spoke of running away from his troubled life by drinking &quot;kumis&quot;.

The Russian composer Alexander Scriabin was recommended a kumis diet and &quot;water cure&quot; by his doctor in his twenties, for his nervous condition and right-hand injury.

The Japanese soft drink Calpis models its flavor after the taste of &quot;kumis&quot;.
